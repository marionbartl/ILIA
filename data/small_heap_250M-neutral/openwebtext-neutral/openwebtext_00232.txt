Hearing about the shortages of Amiibos in the US made me wonder whether the Japanese versions could be usable with a US Wii U. Well, they can and Japan seemingly has a surplus of the figures too.
While there were reports of US Amiibos being region free last year, there was no confirmation that the same could be said for the Japanese versions.
So I went out and nabbed a Luigi to test them on my US Wii U (shown above).
Admittedly I wanted the full on death stare Luigi but sadly Nintendo hasn't complied with my desire for that quite yet.
Anyway, I fired up my copy of Super Smash Bros and tested out my Luigi.
It all worked completely fine and I was able to use the Amiibo entirely as intended within the game.
What's more the selection of available figures here in Tokyo are by no means limited. Almost every shop I entered in various districts had all the available figures and in great quantity too.
The same can be also said for the majority of online retailers here as well.
Some may now think that Nintendo are starving the US of figures and I am not entirely sure that's the case.
This is mainly because Amiibos haven't really caught on in the same way here as they apparently have in the US. This is partly down to things the success of things like Youkai Watch but also the sheer abundance of competition in terms of the toy market in Japan.
So it's entirely likely that Nintendo allocated huge numbers of Amiibos for the US market but due to their popularity they sold out almost instantly.
Either way all this means is that you can readily import fully compatible Amiibos from Japan to your hearts content.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings said India's sovereign ratings will not be affected solely by the unexpected departure of central bank governor Raghuram Rajan at the end of their term in September, adding the country's policies would be the main driver.
Fitch also said the new Reserve Bank of India Governor would inherit a good opportunity to continue pursuing a policy of relatively low consumer price inflation and of strengthening banks' balance sheets.
“From a rating perspective, policies are more important than personalities,” Fitch said in a statement on Monday.
“The problems associated with both high inflation and weak bank balance sheets have been recognized, and policymakers are doing something about it,” Fitch added.
“Such institutionalization implies support for these policies beyond the governor, also among government officials and broader within the RBI.
Fitch has a “BBB-minus” rating with a “stable” outlook for India.
The statement comes after Rajan stunned government officials and colleagues on Saturday by announcing they would step down after just one three-year term ending on Sept. 4.
For weeks, German officials have focused a significant amount of attention on the country's Salafists, members of a fundamentalist strain of Islam who are suspected of having close ties to Islamist extremists. On Thursday, they made their move, raiding Salafist facilities in seven German states and banning one of the most important Salafist groups in the country, the Millatu Ibrahim.
"The organization acts in opposition to the idea of constitutional order and multicultural understanding," German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said on Thursday morning. They added that the group promotes violence in its "fight against existing constitutional order."
In addition, Friedrich says that two other Salafist groups have now been placed under investigation in the hopes of finding enough evidence to be able to ban them as well. Some 1,000 police officers took part in the early morning raids.
Authorities estimate that some 4,000 people belong to Salafist groups in Germany, and that it is the fastest growing strain of Islam in the country. Salafists are considered by the German government to be particularly dangerous and prone to violence, primarily because of their single-minded goal of establishing Sharia in Germany and their rejection of Western values. Furthermore, authorities believe that Salafist groups have close ties to jihadist fighters in Afghanistan and elsewhere.
Active Salafist Scene
Salafists have been in the headlines all spring, initially because of their drive to attract new members by handing out free Korans in major German cities. One of the groups heavily involved in that effort, known as "Die Wahre Religion" or "The True Religion," is among those now under investigation. The founder of Die Wahre Religion, Abou Nagie, has long been under observation by German officials due to their "support for martyrdom and the jihad in the sense of using violence to 'defend' Islam," according to a 2010 domestic intelligence report issued by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The state has an active Salafist scene.
Similarly, the other group now under investigation, Dawa FFM, seeks to radicalize followers by offering "Islam seminars." Authorities in the German state of Hesse, where the group is active, have long had Dawa FFM under observation; Arid Uka, the man who shot and killed two US servicemen and seriously wounded two others at the airport in Frankfurt in March 2011, reportedly was radicalized by Islam seminars offered by Dawa FFM.
Millatu Ibrahim, the group that was banned on Thursday, is led by Mohamed Mahmoud, an Austrian who had lived in Germany since 2011 before leaving the country for Egypt in recent weeks. Domestic intelligence officials believe Mahmoud is a key figure in Germany's jihadist scene. They served four years in jail in Austria after having been convicted in 2007 of creating and promoting a terrorist organization. They left Germany on their own after a court ordered that authorities could expel him.
Spotlight of Justice Officials
While the effort to hand out free Korans across Germany earned Salafists several headlines, it was their violent response to a campaign in North Rhine-Westphalia that landed them in the spotlight of justice officials.
In early May, the Islamophobic mini-party Pro-NRW launched a campaign to display anti-Islam caricatures in front of mosques and other Muslim facilities in North Rhine-Westphalia ahead of elections in the state. Counter-demonstrations in both Solingen and Bonn turned violent, with Salafists attacking police with rocks, sticks and even knives. In Bonn, 29 police were injured, two of them landing in the hospital with stab wounds.
Officials became even more concerned when a Salafist from Bonn, who is now in Afghanistan, issued a video message on the Internet in which they called for the death of Pro-NRW leaders and certain journalists. On Thursday, Pro-NRW took partial credit for the banning of Millatu Ibrahim.
Sicklerville, NJ – Even if President Bush won't admit it, Americans know a recession when they're in it. And things could get worse. As bank interest drops, stuffing the mattress with bills becomes more attractive every day. Sam Willis' patented Money Mattress is selling fast.
“The traditional method of stuffing cash between the mattress and box spring can leave bills musty,” said Willis. “Our patented intra-mattress money box keeps currency fresh while providing the security of knowing your stash is safe at home.”
The Money Mattress hit the market last June, at the same time as Sealy's Dreaming for Dollars. However, Willis' Money Mattress has outsold Sealy's model four to one thanks in part to their ingenious detailing. Every Money Mattress features unique and custom staining through the use of vintage materials.
“They've achieved real authenticity with body fluids and bed bug blemishes,” said mattress market analyst Mark Windsor. “No way anyone would suspect there's money hidden in one of these.”
Willis cautions against keeping US dollars in the mattress, advising on Euros, gold and silver pieces, or yen, which tend to hold their value better. “With the prices rising so sharply on the average American's household purchases, you can't be too careful.”
It's been many weeks topic of discussion, when will the Vega 56 and 64 custom cards get out. Albeit we tested the ASUS one already (here), some new content surfaced of a SAPPHIRE Radeon RX Vega 64 NITRO in Asia.
The NITRO Vega has surfaced, and HWBattle posted a bit of a preview of the card. The NITRO RX Vega 64 comes with a triple-fan cooler and of course, has some LED enablement.
This Radeon RX Vega 64, the one with the GPU has 4096 stream processors, holds a custom tri-fan cooler that tries to keep the card at lower temperatures whilst remaining at hopefully a fairly low and inaudible RPM. Judging from the video, that seems to be in order. From the looks of things, only that VEGA chip is the one thing original, as hey the PCB was modified and customized to seat that RX Vega 64 chip with its onboard 8GB of HBM2. The end result is a beefy looking card alright, at three PCIe slots wide.
As you can see from the photos and video, there is no DVI connector port available. No further and or final specification on clock frequencies have been mentioned. You'll notice a whopping 3x 8-pin power connectors, which is a bit silly, to be honest. Early benchmarks (check the chart below) indicate a very small bump in performance over the reference model.

House Speaker John Boehner said they intend to divert funding from the Justice Department to the U.S. House so Congress can defend the federal law that bars recognition of same-sex marriage.
The Ohio Republican disclosed this in a letter to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who is strongly opposed to Congress going to court to defend the 1996 law. An estimate on court costs was not given.
Pelosi shot back, saying Boehner has not answered their central question about the costs to mounting a defense to the law. "The House of Representatives need not enter into this lengthy and costly litigation," they responded.
Earlier this year, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that Obama administration would no longer defend the constitutionality of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, a Clinton-era law that defines marriage as between a man and a woman. The law also says that states cannot be forced to recognize same-sex marriages from other states.
While President Obama does not support same-sex marriage, they view the Defense of Marriage Act as "unfair," according to spokesperson Jay Carney.
Boehner asked the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group -- consisting of the top House leaders -- to defend the law in court. The GOP members of the group sided with Boehner. Pelosi and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., were opposed.
"By the president's action through the attorney general we have no choice," Boehner's letter says. "The House now faces that additional burden and cost."
Boehner said they have directed the House's counsel and the House Administration Committee to ensure that there are "sufficient resources" and expertise to defend the law. Paul Clement, a former solicitor general for President George W. Bush, has been retained by Boehner and the Republicans to defend the Defense of Marriage Act, according to news reports
Clement's hiring has been criticized by the Human Rights Campaign, the largest gay and lesbian civil rights group.
"Not only are House Republican leaders defending the indefensible, they've brought in a high-priced attorney to deny federal recognition to loving, married couples, " said Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign.
Solmonese said Boehner is "grasping at straws" in their call to divert funds from the Justice Department for the law's defense.
Matt Miller, a spokesperson for the Justice Department, declined to comment.
Media playback is not supported on this device Malaysian GP: Hamilton sets practice pace in searing heat
Lewis Hamilton said their preparations for the Malaysian Grand Prix have been "heavily compromised" by reliability problems with their Mercedes.
The world champion, chasing an eighth win in nine races on Sunday, missed Friday's first session and some of the second but still set the fastest time.
Media playback is not supported on this device Ian Fergusson looks at the forecast as the F1 teams head to Malaysia.
"Whenever you lose a session - and pretty much half of the second - it definitely doesn't help," they said.
"But the team did a great job to rebuild the car and that was crucial."
Despite their problems - caused by a failure in the engine's inlet system and issues with telemetry - Hamilton was 0.428 seconds quicker than team-mate Nico Rosberg.
They admitted that was "good, for sure".
But they added that they would head into final practice before qualifying on Saturday having not made any changes to their set-up, and said the balance of the car had been "quite a bit off from where I need it".
Andrew Benson's Malaysian GP view "Malaysia vies with nearby Singapore as the toughest grand prix on the calendar. "Both take place in crippling tropical heat and humidity. Singapore is longer and bumpier, but takes place in the slightly cooler conditions of night and does not have the demanding high-speed corners of Sepang. "Carved out of former jungle, Sepang is the first and arguably best of the new generation of Formula 1 tracks. Designed by in-house architect Hermann Tilke, it has pretty much got it all - long straights for overtaking, demanding high-speed corners - especially the sweeps of Turns Five and Six - and the tricky 12-13-14 section. "It would be a track that tested drivers to the limits of their abilities even without the punishing conditions."
Hamilton goes into Sunday's second race of the season (at 08:00 BST) seven points clear of likely title rival Rosberg, after the Mercedes drivers finished one-two in Australia two weeks ago.
The Briton said Ferrari looked like being Mercedes's closest rivals after Kimi Raikkonen split them and Rosberg with the second fastest time and produced what appeared to be a strong race-simulation run.

"The Ferraris look great," Hamilton said.
"It's surprising to see how good their times are. We'll see whether that continues through the weekend.
"My lap wasn't spectacular. There are some improvements I can make with the balance and the settings but they were just all brought from the last race. I'm sure we will improve it a little bit.
"I got a fairly decent lap but we haven't dialled the car in, changed the differential settings or changed the set-up at all. So there is definitely some work to do.
"My tyres seemed to be lasting quite well and hopefully it will be good this weekend."

Kissinger's 1957 analysis of how the status quo powers respond to revolutionary powers seems sadly applicable to the situation with Iran today: “All their instincts will cause them to seek to integrate the revolutionary power into the legitimate framework with which they are familiar and which to them seems ‘natural.'” They see negotiations as the preferred way to manage emerging differences. The problem is that for a revolutionary power, a negotiation is not “in itself a symptom of reduced tension,” as the status quo powers would have us believe, but merely a tactic to gain time. Whereas for normal nations, a treaty has legal and moral weight, for the revolutionary power, treaty talks are merely a concessionary phase in the continuing struggle. Think of how North Korea has skillfully—and repeatedly—used the promise of giving up its nuclear capability as a negotiating tool to secure other benefits, from fuel oil to relief from sanctions.
“Iran,” Kissinger told me, “merely by pursuing nuclear weapons, has given itself a role in the region out of proportion to its actual power, and it gains further by the psychological impact of its being able to successfully defy the United Nations Security Council.” Nevertheless, they went on, they do not consider Iran a threat of the “same order of magnitude” as the 1950s' Soviet Union, even as it “ideologically and militarily challenges the Middle East order.”
When I asked Kissinger whether a nuclear Iran would be containable, they suggested that they would want to take tough measures to prevent a nuclear Iran in the first place. They did tell me that the United States had “different deterrence equations” to consider: Iran versus Israel, Iran versus the Sunni Arabs, Iran versus its own dissidents, and Islam versus the West. All of these dynamics, they explained, would interact in the event of an Iran that goes nuclear, and lead to “even more-frequent crises” than we currently have in the Middle East.
But in spite of Iran's refusal thus far to avail itself of “the genuine opportunity to transform itself from a cause to a nation,” Kissinger told me, the country's true strategic interests should “run parallel with our own.” For example, Iran should want to limit Russia's influence in the Caucasus and Central Asia, it should want to limit the Taliban's influence in neighboring Afghanistan, it should accept stability in Iraq, and it should want to serve as a peaceful balancing power in the Sunni Arab world.
Indeed, I would argue that because Sunni Arabs from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, and Egypt perpetrated the attacks of September 11, 2001, and because Sunni hostility to American and Israeli interests remains a conspicuous problem, the United States should theoretically welcome a strengthened Shiite role in the Middle East, were Iran to go through an even partial political transformation. And demographic, cultural, and other indicators all point to a positive ideological and philosophical shift in Iran in the medium to long term. Given this prognosis, and the high cost and poor chances for success of any military effort to eliminate Iran's nuclear program, I believe that containment of a nuclear Iran is the most sensible policy for the United States.

Air force reconnaissance planes to use heat-seeking devices over hundreds of islands in hunt for flight MH370
Indian officials have begun searching hundreds of uninhabited islands in the Andaman Sea using heat-seeking devices in the search for the Malaysia Airlines flight that disappeared six days ago.
Two Indian air force reconnaissance planes began flying over the islands on Friday as a precaution, after they and two naval ships scoured the seas surrounding the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, according to Colonel Harmit Singh of India's tri-services command in the territory.
The archipelago, which stretches south of Burma, contains 572 islands across an area of 52 x 720km. Only 37 are inhabited, with the rest covered in dense forests.
The Indian navy was considering expanding its search west into the Bay of Bengal.
Singh declined to give details about the rest of the search operation, including the use of the heat sensors on the Dornier planes.
Coastguard official VSR Murthy said India would turn its focus toward western waters between the islands and the Indian coast. On Friday, two navy ships were still sailing east of Great Nicobar Island.
Share. We learn some cool things about Final Fantasy's past and present We learn some cool things about Final Fantasy's past and present
This week marks the 30th anniversary of Final Fantasy, the critically acclaimed franchise that changed the RPG landscape forever. In honor of this momentous occasion, I asked Final Fantasy IV lead designer and Chrono Trigger director Tokita Takashi to share their thoughts on the series' epic journey, what they think would make a cool Final Fantasy VR experience, and (while I was at it) if we'll ever see another Chrono Trigger game.
IGN: It's been 30 years since Final Fantasy was first released, and you've worked on the series from pretty much the beginning. Did you have any inkling that the series would be this popular for this long?
Exit Theatre Mode
Tokita: When I was working on the first title in the series depicting monsters in pixels, I never imagined the series would be popular for this long. I think there was a firm belief that the game would turn into a series when it continued onto the third installment, and with the fourth installment, there was a sense of pressure, though it all felt worth accomplishing. That said, never in my dreams did I think we would be celebrating its 30th anniversary, nor did I think I would have been able to continue developing games for this many years.
IGN: What do you think is the secret to Final Fantasy's long success?
Tokita: Perhaps the fact that it's a title that stations itself within the ever-evolving field of games in terms of platform and gameplay style, as well as the fact that the younger generation who once played those titles are now becoming game creators themselves, and introducing new Final Fantasy experiences to the world. Following manga and anime, I feel like it's evident that RPGs have turned into a form of Japanese culture.
IGN: Square Enix just released Final Fantasy: XV Monster of the Deep on PSVR. Would you ever consider doing a VR experience for one of the classic Final Fantasy games? Maybe walk around the moon in FFIV, or other contents from FFI to FFIV?
Exit Theatre Mode
Tokita: That sounds awesome! It would be fun if we'd be able to experience different Final Fantasy worlds within a theme park, something along the lines of an “FF VR World”. For FFIV, something like an adventure that involves landing on the moon aboard the Lunar Whale, or traveling to Feymarch after being swallowed by Leviathan; those are two experiences I would like to try out myself. I suppose with other titles in the series…For FFI, an experience that spans over 2000 years. For FFII perhaps heading into the cyclone on a Wind Drake. For FF6, perhaps marching through the snowfields aboard the magitek armor.
IGN: Final Fantasy IV was the series' first big breakout. What about that game do you think makes it so special?
Tokita: Thank you! After the first three title releases on the Famicon (NES equivalent), it was the first Final Fantasy released for the Super Famicon (SNES equivalent). Moreover, given that the game was to be released on the platform before our rival Dragon Quest, the entire dev team was so fired up during the game's development; every one of us gave it our all.
Exit Theatre Mode
Tokita: Personally, I wanted to make Final Fantasy IV a culmination of the preceding titles, keeping all the great features from FFI, FFII, and FFIII. Golbez as a reflection of the four fiends from FFI, the focus on the meeting and parting of friends and the story driven nature of FFII, the characters and abilities that follow the jobs introduced in FFIII, these are just some of the wonderful aspects. Furthermore, we expressed a sense of scale that was unprecedented through its visuals, heading deep underground all the way to the moon, and we feel like this helped shape the image of Final Fantasy as we see it today.
IGN: From a gameplay standpoint, FFIV did a lot of innovative things: it was the first game to introduce the Active Time Battle system, as well as use SNES Mode 7 technology. It's also the first 16-bit game in the series. What were some of the challenges involved with trying to implement these new mechanics?
Exit Theatre Mode
Tokita: The Active Time Battle was truly a result of repeated trial and error. In actuality, we were unable to envision, in the slightest, which characters would take action after input based on the initial conditions in which the order of character speed, and wait time between actions were set. As a result, we omitted the wait time associated with direct attacks, and lengthened the wait time for things such as powerful magic, adjusting the specifications so that the behavior that follows an input would be more imaginable. The number of colors available for graphics also increased versus the Famicon, but even so, the overall size of the ROM itself was 8 Mbit and quite small, so it required us to get creative, such as holding back on the color count on features aside from the airship and main characters. Furthermore, we had to cut down the scenario to a quarter of its original length, so we focused on changing the pacing, and placed utmost importance on the tempo for areas other than the standout moments. Personally, it became a really good learning experience when it comes to scenario production.
IGN: Let's switch gears for a second. You also worked on Chrono Trigger, which IGN recently voted as the best RPG of all time. What about Chrono Trigger makes you the most proud?
Exit Theatre Mode
Tokita: Thank you! I was extremely happy to see the game being recognized by IGN! What about Chrono Trigger makes me the most proud? There are many aspects, but perhaps the fact that we were able to create a new form of RPG that transcends both Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest. I believe in some ways, Chrono Trigger led the way for RPGs that command a visual sense of scale through 3D and camerawork that became prominent from PlayStation and onwards. But, when it comes down to it, I think it's everyone's love for the title. This includes everyone across the world, from the American staff I worked with on Parasite Eve, as well as the younger generation of this day!

We rather liked the Livestream Mevo camera when we reviewed it last year. The palm-sized device made it easy to stream to Facebook Live or Livestream through an iOS device, but it wasn't perfect. It lacked support for Android, couldn't live-stream to YouTube, and even internal recording was limited to 720p despite using a 4K sensor. Last month, Livestream brought Twitter/Periscope support to the Mevo. And today, April 23, it announced during the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) Show, that virtually all of the camera's other limitations will soon be things of the past.
Mevo's beta Android app finally brings support to more devices (access the public beta here) and Livestream anticipates having the final version of the app ready by the end of this summer. Digital Trends has confirmed with Livestream that the final version of the Android app will have feature parity with its iOS counterpart, although today's beta version does not.
For now, iOS users have the option of testing the waters with their own Mevo beta. Also available today, the iOS beta brings several new features to the Mevo platform, including the option to save 4K video to the camera's MicroSD card when using the optional Mevo Boost accessory. Users won't be able to live-stream in 4K, but the beta does add support for 1080p live-streaming, a nice step up from the previous 720p limit. YouTube streaming support has also been added while a number of new features have come to Facebook Live, including continuous streaming options, scheduled live-streams for pages, geolocation and friend tags, and audience targeting.
Livestream is running a special on the Mevo Pro Bundle through April 30. The bundle includes the camera, the Mevo Boost accessory, and and a carrying case for $600 (normally $700). In addition to adding a MicroSD card slot, the Mevo Boost contains a 10-hour battery and Ethernet port for an even more reliable network connection. The standard Mevo remains priced at $400.
Does anybody else remember Capcom's Dead Rising? It was an early Xbox 360 videogame and one of the first major zombie games of the new millennium. Here's my take on the game's hero, investigative reporter Frank West. Frank's an abrasive and sarcastic kind of guy but they have a heart of gold and does the right thing when it counts. He's one of the few characters of that generation of gaming that I still remember, so that's gotta count for something.
For this figure, I tried to recreate the look of the game where the characters look blocky, yet have realistic skin textures. The head is a crazy dummy (i think) head which I re-sculpted to look cartoonier and irritated, just like Frank. Chainsaw is some Power Team POS that I repainted and weathered.
Anyways, here's a preview. I'll shoot better pix once I've weathered & re-done all of the zombies for my shelf dio.
text archives > situationist international texts > Address to All Workers Enragés-Situationist International Committee, Council for Maintaining the Occupations Paris, 30 May 1968 Translated by Ken Knabb COMRADES, What we have already done in France is haunting Europe and will soon threaten all the ruling classes of the world, from the bureaucrats of Moscow and Peking to the millionaires of Washington and Tokyo. Just as we have made Paris dance, the international proletariat will once again take up its assault on the capitals of all the states and all the citadels of alienation. The occupation of factories and public buildings throughout the country has not only brought a halt to the functioning of the economy, it has brought about a general questioning of the society. A deep-seated movement is leading almost every sector of the population to seek a real transformation of life. This is the beginning of a revolutionary movement, a movement which lacks nothing but the consciousness of what it has already done in order to triumph. What forces will try to save capitalism? The regime will fall unless it threatens to resort to arms (accompanied by the promise of new elections, which could only take place after the capitulation of the movement) or even resorts to immediate armed repression. If the Left comes to power, it too will try to defend the old world through concessions and through force. The best defender of such a popular government would be the so-called Communist Party, the party of Stalinist bureaucrats, which has fought the movement from the very beginning and which began to envisage the fall of the de Gaulle regime only when it realized it was no longer capable of being that regimes main guardian. Such a transitional government would really be Kerenskyist only if the Stalinists were beaten. All this will ultimately depend on the workers consciousness and capacities for autonomous organization. The workers who have already rejected the ridiculous agreement that the union leaders were so pleased with need only discover that they cannot win much more within the framework of the existing economy, but that they can take everything by transforming all the bases of the economy on their own behalf. The bosses can hardly pay more; but they can disappear. The present movement did not become politicized by going beyond the miserable union demands regarding wages and pensions, demands which were falsely presented as social questions. It is beyond politics: it is posing the social question in its simple truth. The revolution that has been in the making for over a century is returning. It can express itself only in its own forms. Its too late for a bureaucratic-revolutionary patching up. When a recently de-Stalinized bureaucrat like André Barjonet calls for the formation of a common organization that would bring together all the authentic forces of revolution . . . whether they march under the banner of Trotsky or Mao, of anarchy or situationism, we need only recall that those who today follow Trotsky or Mao, to say nothing of the pitiful Anarchist Federation, have nothing to do with the present revolution. The bureaucrats may now change their minds about what they call authentically revolutionary; authentic revolution will not change its condemnation of bureaucracy. At the present moment, with the power they hold and with the parties and unions being what they are, the workers have no other choice but to organize themselves in unitary rank-and-file committees directly taking over the economy and all aspects of the reconstruction of social life, asserting their autonomy vis-à-vis any sort of political or unionist leadership, ensuring their self-defense and federating with each other regionally and nationally. In so doing they will become the sole real power in the country, the power of the workers councils. The only alternative is to return to their passivity and go back to watching television. The proletariat is either revolutionary or nothing. What are the essential features of council power?
Dissolution of all external power
Direct and total democracy
Practical unification of decision and execution
Delegates who can be revoked at any moment by those who have mandated them
Abolition of hierarchy and independent specializations
Conscious management and transformation of all the conditions of liberated life
Permanent creative mass participation
Internationalist extension and coordination The present requirements are nothing less than this. Self-management is nothing less. Beware of all the modernist coopters  including even priests  who are beginning to talk of self-management or even of workers councils without acknowledging this minimum, because they want to save their bureaucratic functions, the privileges of their intellectual specializations or their future careers as petty bosses! In reality, what is necessary now has been necessary since the beginning of the proletarian revolutionary project. Its always been a question of working-class autonomy. The struggle has always been for the abolition of wage labor, of commodity production, and of the state. The goal has always been to accede to conscious history, to suppress all separations and everything that exists independently of individuals. Proletarian revolution has spontaneously sketched out its appropriate forms in the councils  in St. Petersburg in 1905, in Turin in 1920, in Catalonia in 1936, in Budapest in 1956. The preservation of the old society, or the formation of new exploiting classes, has each time been over the dead body of the councils. The working class now knows its enemies and its own appropriate methods of action. Revolutionary organization has had to learn that it can no longer fight alienation with alienated forms (The Society of the Spectacle). Workers councils are clearly the only solution, since all the other forms of revolutionary struggle have led to the opposite of what was aimed at.
Ottawa Backing Away from Pledge to Increase the Number of Wireless Competitors
The government's push for a fourth wireless player in every region is apparently losing power. Industry Minister James Moore said on Wednesday that the government will let the market decide whether there is a need for a fourth competitor, downplaying Ottawa's earlier efforts to expand beyond the country's three major carriers to foster competition and bring down prices.
“It would be irresponsible for us to have a public policy that wasn't setting in place the parameters where more competition could emerge, if the market can support it,” Moore said in an interview with The Canadian Press. “Whatever dynamic emerges that the marketplace can support, the marketplace will decide that,” Moore said from Ottawa.
The government has relaxed the rules relating to foreign investment for wireless companies with less than 10% of market share, paving the way for new entrants. This, you may recall, sparked an intensive marketing campaign from the incumbents sending the message that the government would give an unfair advantage to foreign players such as Verizon. Ottawa decided to fight back with its own marketing campaign. Verizon, however, decided not to enter the local wireless market.
As Moore said, they would like the norm to reflect the situation in Atlantic Canada, Québec and Saskatchewan, where the Big Three have local wireless players to compete with, such as Eastlink, Videotron and Sasktel.
In the light of the (currently) ongoing 700 MHz wireless spectrum auction, it would be interesting to see whether Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia will get to see an emerging fourth local player. One more thing: Wind Mobile and Mobilicity are currently up for sale. The latter has received offers from multiple parties, but Wind Mobile's fate is still uncertain, as its backer, VimpelCom, could cut financing at any time, just as it did with the wireless auction when it scrapped future 700 MHz spectrum-related plans.

1. What is Electoralism and WSM Participation
1.1 When we talk of electoralism we mean those methods that seek change through putting forward individuals for representative forms of government under class rule, i.e. parliaments and town or regional councils.
1.2 We have two fundamental issues with these institutions:
1. They exist in order to manage capitalism through the state in a way that minimises conflict between the capitalist class and dampens conflict between that class and the rest of society.
2. They are constructed so that representatives cannot be mandated by those who elect them or recalled as soon as they break such mandates. This is by design, these methods of 2 rule are intended to be unaccountable so that those in them can make decisions in favour of the capitalist class that may be at odds with the wishes of those who elected them.
1.3 For these reasons we do not run candidates for election, and in almost every circumstance we do not advocate people vote. The only exceptions being the rare occasions where an election is in effect a referendum in a hyper-polarised society, one example being the 1994 election in South Africa that was deeply connected to the movement to end apartheid.
1.4 Referendums are different in that the people get to directly vote on an issue, thus making the decision themselves. While fundamentally different this is not to say referendums do not have their own problems including:
1. The question to be voted on is generally formulated by politicians and may well be worded to exclude best options.
2. They still take place in class society and within the constitutional limits imposed by that society. This means they can only be about redividing the small share of the cake given to the working classes rather than seizing the bakery.
3. In many countries including Ireland referendums can only be called by politicians and needed referenda can thus be delayed for years and even decades.
2. Opposition to Electoralism
2.1 We generally won't run high profile ‘spoil your vote' campaigns as while these can have an educational aspect they also tend to create unnecessary hostility with other groups and individuals on the left who engage in electoralism. For that reason we are unlikely to engage in active mass outreach around the anarchist criticism of electoralism while campaigning is in progress, holding off until polls close or before such campaigns are really underway.
2.2 Our focus is generally on:
1. Showing electoralism to be a carefully constructed mechanism for managing capitalism and minimising dissent.
2. Showing that participation in electoralism de-radicalises organisations and individuals over time. Electoralism restores faith in the system, fosters a culture of ‘Someone Else Will Do It', and incentivises political opportunism.
3. Arguing that the decision to abstain far from being apathetic can be based on an understanding of how the system really works which is far more accurate than left electoralism.
4. Contrasting electoralism with systems of real democracy that give people a direct say in governance.
Two bills filed by South Texas Democrats would prohibit individuals from using the state's food stamp program to purchase energy drinks and junk food such as candy, chips and cookies.
Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (formerly known as food stamps) is a needs-based program to assist Texans who work more than 20 hours a week or are disabled or pregnant buy groceries. More than 4.1 million Texans utilize the program as of December, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.
Current restrictions on SNAP purchases include alcohol and tobacco products, vitamins and medicines and hot food.
State Rep. Terry Canales of Edinburg filed HB 523, which defines “energy drink” as a beverage containing 65 milligrams of caffeine per 8 fluid ounces designed to increase mental or physical energy. Coffee-based beverages are exempt from the restriction.
“SNAP was originally created and implemented to provide food and nutritional sustenance to people in need of governmental assistance, and energy drinks in my opinion simply do not meet that criteria,” Canales said. “Energy drinks have led to thousands of people being hospitalized due to resulting health complications and in some instances death.”
State Rep. Richard Pena Raymond of Laredo filed HB 751, which would ban SNAP purchases of candy, potato and corn chips, cookies and sweetened beverages.
“We should not on the one hand be using tax dollars to buy junk food and then on the other hand using tax dollars for health-related diseases that come about because of junk food,” Raymond, chair of the House Human Services committee, told KGBT news in the Valley.
However, a Linda Edwards Gockel, spokesperson for Texas Health and Human Services Commission, said other states have tried to prohibit certain types of foods from food stamp programs but the federal Food and Nutritional Service has denied those attempts each time.
“The federal government has not allowed it,” they said.
Turkish authorities have arrested dozens of people protesting in the fiercest anti-government demonstrations the country has witnessed in years, with riot police firing tear gas on demonstrators in Istanbul and Ankara.
At least 60 people were detained on Friday as they protested in Istanbul at a rally which began over the demolition of a park, but which turned into a broader protest against what they see as an increasingly authoritarian government.
"The protesters are saying that this is not about trees anymore," said Al Jazeera's Rawya Rageh, reporting from Istanbul.
Several thousand people had attended the Istanbul protest, and there is "an assortment of tear gas cannisters everywhere" in the city's main Taksim Square, they said.
More than 100 people were injured, some left lying on the ground unconscious, while two people were hospitalised with injuries to the head, an AFP photographer witnessed.
In the most severe case, a Turkish national of Palestinian origin had to undergo brain surgery after fractures to their skull, but they were doing well in intensive care, according to Istanbul governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu.
They said in televised remarks that an investigation was underway and people had been detained for "provoking violence."
The demonstrators had occupied the Gezi park since May 28 to prevent bulldozers from completing the demolition, part of the government's redevelopment plan for central Taksim Square.
In a victory for the protesters later on Friday, an Istanbul court ordered the temporary suspension of the project to uproot the trees.
But the protest spread to the capital Ankara, where about 5,000 people gathered in a park, and with police there firing tear gas to disperse crowds trying to reach the headquarters of the ruling Justice and Development Party.
The demonstrators, mostly young supporters of the opposition Republican People's Party, had planned to protest against new laws restricting the sale of alcohol and chanted: "Everywhere is resistance, Everywhere is Taksim."
The rallies also spread to two locations in the Aegean coastal city of Izmir.
Several protesters in Istanbul were injured when a wall they climbed collapsed during a police chase, and a prominent journalist was hospitalised after being hit in the head by a tear gas canister, the private Dogan news agency reported.
Rageh said many protesters complained that the police were using water cannon and firing teargas indiscriminately.
"We saw a lot of tourists running to different directions. People are trying to take refuge at coffee shops and the homes around the area. Police have been firing tear gas in different directions," they said.
"Certainly the predominant complaint here is that police are firing teargas indiscriminately.
"But they are also coming under attack from protesters. You can see them with rocks and there are injuries here. People are very angry."
'Authoritarian' government
Many of the protesters are angry at Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's Islamic-rooted government, which some Turks argue has been displaying increasingly authoritarian and uncompromising tendencies in its third successive term in office.
Last week, the government enacted a law restricting the sale and advertising of alcohol which has alarmed secular Turks who fear an encroachment on more liberal lifestyles.
Earlier this week, the government went ahead with a ground-breaking ceremony for the construction of a disputed third bridge across the Bosphorus Strait which some say will destroy the few remaining green areas of the city.
It also named the bridge after a controversial Ottoman sultan believed to have ordered a massacre of a minority Shia Muslim group, instead of choosing a more unifying figure.
Gezi Park protestors held a large poster with a caricature depicting Erdoğan as an Ottoman sultan with a caption that read: "The people won't yield to you."
Erdoğan dismissed the protesters' demands for the park's protection, saying the government would go ahead with renovation plans "no matter what they do".
The forestry minister said more trees would be planted than those uprooted at Gezi and has defended the government's environmental record.
Friday's dawn raid was the latest in a series of aggressive crackdown on protests. Human rights activists accuse Turkish police of using inordinate force to break up protests.
On Friday, demonstrators affected by the gas sought shelter at a luxury hotel at Taksim and were tended by guests.
Police removed tents and demonstrators' other belongings and mounted barricades around the park.

About These Data
The articles and authors described in this data were drawn from the corpus of JSTOR, a digital archive of scholarly papers, by researchers at the Eigenfactor Project at the University of Washington. About two million articles, representing 1765 fields and sub-fields, were examined, spanning a period from 1665 to 2011. The data are presented here for three time periods, the latest one ending in 2010, and a view that combines all periods. A dataset that also includes papers from 2011 can be found at www.eigenfactor.org/gender.
Articles have been classified into fields and subfields using the hierarchical map equation method. (This is described in this technical article: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3072965/) The names of each field and subfield have been selected by hand and are not intended as a definitive classification, but rather to provide a general indication of the subject matter. Data was analyzed using the tools EigenfactorClassification, Gender Browser, Hoptree, and Hier_infomap.
The data derived from JSTOR include papers in the hard sciences, the social sciences, law, history, philosophy, and education. But there is limited coverage of engineering, English, foreign languages, and physics so they are excluded from this analysis.
Gender of authors was determined after researchers consulted data on birth names collected by the U.S. Social Security Administration. If a name was used at least 95 percent of the time for a female, that name was considered female; a similar test was used for male authors. If you use of the name was more ambiguous, it was not included.
First author position is generally considered to be given to the person who made thelargest contribution to the paper. There are fields that are exceptions. Economics and mathematics, for example, commonly assign author order alphabetically.
Last author position, in the biological sciences, is generally reserved for the principal investigator or project director. This convention may not be observed in other disciplines, so analysis of last author here is restricted to major biological sciences.

MILWAUKEE (WITI) -- A popular bar on Milwaukee's East Side reopened Monday, May 4th. The bar was closed for a few nights after an incident this weekend that has some calling for a boycott.
In this story LEARN MORE: Two Bucks bar
Former Two Bucks employees and former customers were among those hanging posters on the East Side Sunday. They are urging the community to boycott the popular bar after a group of African-American patrons claim they experienced racism by the bar's owner.
A Facebook group encouraging the boycott had more than 2,000 "likes" by Monday afternoon.
"The bar should be closed down," Robert Redd said.
Redd is a former Two Bucks bouncer. They say they were working at the bar on Friday night, May 1st when they say the bar's owner made insensitive and racist comments.
"I was hurt," Redd said. "She made a statement 'do you stand behind blacks or do you stand behind the bar?' And I made a comment -- 'I stand behind what`s right.'"
Redd says on several occasions, they were ordered to escort African-Americans out of the bar for no apparent reason.
"There were two African-American males paying for the juke box. They wanted them out. Then they kicked out a group of African-American males stating that they were being suspicious and drinking too slow. Then the third incident -- had a group of African-American females come up. They said 'these people are not getting in my bar,'" Redd said.
FOX6 News spoke with a customer who says they were discriminated against on Friday night.
"She asked us to leave and told us that we were too ghetto to be there," the customer said.
What allegedly happened at the bar on Friday night led to customers leaving, employees quitting, and a social media campaign being launched calling for a boycott of Two Bucks.
A former Two Bucks bar manager says alcohol is what has fueled the bar owner's comments. In logs they kept while working at the bar, they often noted their drinking habits. Entries include: "Lynn was very drunk, then began acting very inappropriately," "behind the bar, pouring their own drinks," "Lynn very drunk, offensive to E & K. They were unable to stand upright and drooled on herself."
While the former bar manager says they think the bar owner's behavior was questionable, they say they didn't think they were racist.
FOX6 News stopped by the bar on Monday and spoke with the bar's owner, Lynn Forthaus. They didn't want to comment further, saying she's sticking by a statement they issued Sunday. That statement reads:
"There was an unfortunate incident at Two Bucks late Friday, May 1st. I apologize that this occurred. It does not reflect the views of the company, owners or employees of Two Bucks. We embrace diversity and have already taken steps so this will never happen again."

It all started in 1987.
Five years after introducing the now famous Forbes 400 list, the wealth team undertook a project that would set the stage for what has become a staple of modern media: the World's Billionaires List. In the days before google and the web, wealth reporters scoured the globe, making phone calls, traveling to Asia and reading through documents to uncover and pinpoint fortunes (we still do that but the Internet certainly helps). They were able to find the richest man in the world, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi of Japan, in addition to 95 also-rans from overseas.
Though the concept is still the same, a lot has changed in the last 25 years. Aside from the evolution of our valuation methods, there has been a large shift in the source of wealth, not to mention nearly double digit growth in the number of billionaires on the list. This year, we identified 1,226 individuals, with 801 coming from abroad. In 1987, Forbes found 140 billionaires including 96 outside of the U.S.
A number of the original members have actually been on the list multiple times, with a handful making it on every single year, including Li Ka-shing,who appeared on one of the covers of this years World's Billionaires List. Other familiar or notable names on that first list were Fiat's Giovanni Agnelli, Columbian drug dealer Pablo Escobar, Australia's Kerry Packer and the Benetton family. The richest person was Japanese real estate baron, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, who fell off the list years later.
These trailblazers have more in common with today's wealthy elite than perhaps might be expected. Roughly 60% of that first class were self-made, with only Europe having predominately old, inherited money. They made their money predominately in real estate (24), manufacturing (17), and retail (15). Today the non-u.s. billionaires still get the bulk of their fortunes from those industries (the only difference is that many by now have diversified into other areas and have turned their businesses into sprawling conglomerates.)

Normally when we hear about conservative businesses rejecting LGBT people's orders, it's because they've been asked to provide supplies for a same-sex wedding that they say is against their religious beliefs.
In this case, though, a baker in Ohio rejected a customer's order for a simple birthday cake only after snooping on the customer's Facebook page and learning that she's married to another woman.
Candice Lowe had ordered a birthday cake for their wife, Amanda, from Take the Cake Bakery in Toledo. Then they received a text message from LeGresha Fizer-Brown, the owner, canceling their order. Fizer-Brown had looked Lowe up on Facebook and learned that way that their customer was in a same-sex relationship.
The text message read:
“Candice, I'm sorry… I just realized your [sic] in a same-sex relationship and we do not do cakes for same sex weddings or parties…I'm so sorry. I wasn't aware of this exactly until I saw your page. Take care:)”
Lowe received the text while they were on their honeymoon, of all places, and they and their new wife were rightfully devastated.
The Lowes, who were married just two weeks ago, said they “just wanted to cry” when they received the text. Candice Lowe later posted the alleged message to their Facebook page, and a screenshot appears on the progressive news site, Peacock Panache. Bakeries and other wedding-related venues have become an unlikely battleground for LGBT rights in recent years, with owners often citing their religious beliefs in turning away same-sex couples seeking cakes and other services. Still, this may be the first case in recent memory where such a flap has erupted over a birthday, as opposed to a wedding, cake. “A birthday cake has nothing to do with your sexual preference,” Candice Lowe told ABC 13. “Are you saying that, since we're gay, we can't eat cake?”
“Religious freedom” bills around the country seek to make this kind of discrimination legal, but it might not fly in this particular city. While there is no statewide law in Ohio protecting LGBT people from discrimination, Toledo is one of the cities in Ohio where these protections do exist. That means bad news for the bakery if Lowe takes legal action.
The Huffington Post's attempts to reach the Take the Cake Bakery via the phone number listed on its Facebook page were unsuccessful and Fizer-Brown reportedly did not respond to requests for comment by ABC 13, NBC 24 and Peacock Panache. Candice Lowe told NBC 24 that she's ordered a cake for Amanda from a different bakery, but hopes that Fizer-Brown will learn from the experience.
I guess discrimination is acceptable if you end it with a smiley face.
YouTube Screenshot Yu Youzhen, a 53-year-old woman who lives in the Chinese city of Wuhan, is wealthy. According to the South China Morning Post, Yu is the proud owner of 17 apartments worth more than 10 million yuan (approximately $1.5 million).
But Yu does something most rich people do not. Six days a week they wake up and goes to work as a sanitation worker for the city, earning a monthly salary of just 1,420 yuan ($227)
Since their discovery by a reporter for local newspaper Wuhan Evening Times, Yu has become a symbol of hard work and determination in China.
They have kept their job, which involves scrubbing the streets and emptying trash cans, since 1998, and grew up in poor circumstances. When they came into the ownership of the expensive apartments in the city in 2008, they were determined not to become lazy like many others who came into ownership, Netease reports.
"I want to be a role model for my son and daughter. I don't want to sit around idly and eat away my fortune," Yu told reporters. So far, their children are following in their footsteps, with one son working as a driver and a daughter working in another job.

Bangladesh's Test line-up won't have Mushfiqur Rahim for the first time in nearly 10 years Getty Images
Big picture
Bangladesh's tour of New Zealand just got harder, with their captain Mushfiqur Rahim, opener Imrul Kayes and No. 3 Mominul Haque ruled out of the second Test in Christchurch. They will need time to recover from injuries. Mushfiqur's thumb will keep them out for at least three weeks, Imrul has a grade-two thigh strain, and Mominul has a rib injury.
Mushfiqur's absence, in particular, will be a shock to the system: this will be the first time since June 2007 that they will not be a part of their batting order. They have been a stable cog in a middle order that has undergone through several changes over the years. In their absence, greater responsibility will fall on Shakib Al Hasan and Mahmudullah.
Imrul, too, has been important as one half of Bangladesh's best opening partnership, so Tamim Iqbal will carry a double burden - as opener and now, captain. Soumya Sarkar will open for the first time in Tests. Mominul's absence is also a severe blow: they made 64 and 23 in Wellington and had not missed a Test since February 2013. Bangladesh will do well to replicate their first innings at Basin Reserve, but improve upon their bowling.
Bangladesh's injured " Mushfiqur still has pain in the joint of their right thumb, which needs time to heal," Bangladesh physio Dean Conway said. "At this stage we are confident that they will recover fully in a couple of weeks and will be fit for our next Test commitment."
" Imrul has a strain in the front thigh muscle sustained on day four of the first Test. They will need around two weeks to return to training from the day of the injury.
"Mominul is nursing a bruised rib cage. The x-ray on them came out clear but they were unable to make the necessary movements in training today and is not fit for the Test."
New Zealand have few such worries, given almost everyone made contributions in the first Test. Tom Latham and Kane Williamson struck hundreds while Ross Taylor, Henry Nicholls, Mitchell Santner and BJ Watling all contributed. As at Wellington, it will be their bowling, which brings a range of threats, and that will be the difference.
Form guide
New Zealand WWWLL (last five completed Tests, most recent first)
Bangladesh LWLDD
In the spotlight
Neil Wagner will once again test the Bangladesh¹s technique against the short ball. They were relentless against Mushfiqur in the second innings in Wellington.
Shakib Al Hasan made the highest score by a Bangladesh batsman in the first innings but played a wild shot that derailed their effort in the second. Free-flowing batting is their forte but there will be times when they have to curb the natural instinct.
Team news
The hosts are unlikely to change their line-up barring any last-minute injuries.
New Zealand (probable) 1 Jeet Raval, 2 Tom Latham, 3 Kane Williamson (capt), 4 Ross Taylor, 5 Henry Nicholls, 6 Colin de Grandhomme, 7 BJ Watling (wk), 8 Mitchell Santner, 9 Tim Southee, 10 Trent Boult, 11 Neil Wagner
Wicketkeeper Nurul Hasan and Soumya Sarkar will come in for the injured pair of Mushfiqur and Imrul Kayes. The uncapped Nazmul Hossain Shanto is likely to replace Mominul at No.3. Nazmul and fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman, who were travelling with the squad, were called in as back-up.
Bangladesh (probable) 1 Tamim Iqbal (capt), 2 Soumya Sarkar, 3 Nazmul Hossain 4 Mahmudullah, 5 Shakib Al Hasan, 6 Nurul Hasan (wk), 7 Sabbir Rahman, 8 Mehedi Hasan, 9 Rubel Hossain, 10 Taskin Ahmed, 11 Subashis Roy
Pitch and conditions
The Hagley Oval pitch was under covers for most of the last two days, but both teams are expecting it to be bowling-friendly especially in the initial skirmishes. Pakistan, the last visiting team that played at this venue, had a rough time, getting bowled out for 133 in the first innings.
Stats and trivia
Tamim Iqbal will become Bangladesh's ninth Test captain.
BJ Watling needs two catches off the bowling of Tim Southee to break the New Zealand record for best wicketkeeper-bowler partnership.
Ross Taylor has the chance to equal Martin Crowe's record for most Test centuries by a New Zealander - 17.
Quotes
"It hasn't been a frustrating tour. The way we played cricket, was quite good. The result doesn't show our competitiveness."
Tamim, Iqbal , Bangladesh¹s captain for the second Test, on their side's tour so far.
"Hagley Oval is a pretty good surface. Generally a bit of grass is left on it and ball tends to seam around. I think the first couple of hours are crucial, but it does turn into a nice batting wicket."

John, my 7-year-old son, and I crisscross our backyard, pacing the boundaries of our would-be DIY skating rink. It's late October, too soon to be thinking about ice. But we've endured a few winters here in Ann Arbor, Mich.—frigid, soul-sucking winters—so we're plotting a way to brighten up the dark months. As the day fades into ­twilight, we kick paths into the fallen leaves, defining the rink's edges. An ambitious kid who's towheaded like their mom, John skirts the far reaches of the yard.
My wife, MaryLinda, emerges from the house, holding our other son, Sam, 1; our daughter, Abby, 5, trails behind. "Wow, that's going to be a huge rink," MaryLinda says. Abby frolics in the leaves, obliterating John's and my work. John throws up their hands, yelling, "Aaaah-beee!" It's still just a notion, but the rink is already doing its job.
Before MaryLinda and I had kids, I survived the cold months in Michigan with a garage project, like rebuilding a car. But now, holing up solo wouldn't cut it. The rink harked back to my childhood pond-hockey days and seemed like the perfect solution. I hoped it would get us all out of the house, while serving as a beacon for the neighbors, most of whom we still hardly knew after nine years.
But there was a problem: Our backyard slopes down about 3 feet over a 60-foot stretch from the back of the house. Any reasonably sized rink would need a stout retaining wall at least 2 feet high at the deep end. That would call for more water—and more construction—than I had in mind.
"Let's use the driveway," John suggests, an idea I consider until my wife asks where we'd park the cars.
"On the street, of course," says John.
While preparing to tell John the many practical reasons their proposed solution won't work, my gaze wanders next door, into the Browns' backyard.
When Chris Brown, 48, and their family arrived, in 2005, they turned the rolling, wooded space into a soccer pitch, complete with full-size goals. In above-freezing weather, it was a great place for their two teenage sons to hone their considerable skills. But it went unused all winter, so...
"Let's go talk to Chris," I say to John, and we amble over. Since no one in Chris's family skates, I mentally work up a spiel about why they need a rink in their yard. We say hello to Chris, and I start in with tales of my recreational hockey exploits, segueing into a sermon about the value of teaching our kids how to make the most out of winter's harsh reality. My coup de grâce is a quote from snowboard innovator Jake Burton, who said, "I tell my kids, 'Bring it!' Winter's just another thing to bring you down." In other words, when life gives you frigid temperatures, make ice.
"Fantastic!" Chris exclaims. "Let's do it."
Startled by their enthusiasm, I warn that the rink might leave a mark when we dismantle it in the spring. Undaunted, Chris says, "Hey, man, we've got the space, let's use it."
Enlisting The Troops
With my rudimentary rink drawings at hand, I poke around the Web for plans that might show me something I've overlooked. My sketches call for a plastic-lined, 40 x 60–foot box made out of 2 x 12s conjoined by sheet-metal tie plates and held upright by iron stakes. I'm proud of the rugged simplicity—until I see the NHL-worthy rinks built by other backyard DIYers. The only thing they lack is a Zamboni. But for a time-challenged father of three, I reason, rugged simplicity is the way to go.
My plan relies on the field being basically flat, with the foot-wide planks accommodating any slope invisible to the eye. Knowing I'll need at least 3 inches of ice for a stable skating surface, I figure I'll have 9 inches of wiggle room. It all seems about right—but I wake up one night, terrified that my crude calculations will lead to disaster. I need a transit, a ­gradient-measuring device. I call Dave Ferguson, an architect friend. They drop by in early November, and we stake out a detailed grid, using their trusty transit.
Good move: The gradient of the rink location turns out to be a full 12 inches, so one end would be full to the brim and the other dry. We relocate the grid to an area with an 8-inch gradient. "That'll do," I think. But Dave isn't finished. Two days later they e-mail me a computer-generated drawing of an oval rink and a list of building materials. Their plan is far more elegant than mine, with boards of varying widths to bring the ice flush with the border.
Dave's enthusiasm gets me thinking: If I ask enough people for help, I could Tom Sawyer the whole thing. But I also have a bigger idea in mind, another vestige of my youth. I grew up in New Jersey in the '70s. We lived on a dead-end street of modest, single-story homes. The Garden State's image has long suffered because of a foul, industrial corridor along the northernmost stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike, to say nothing of the stereotypes perpetuated by The Sopranos and—heaven save us—Jersey Shore. That's not my New Jersey. In our neighborhood a strong work ethic and a propensity to help one another prevailed. The dads joined forces to build decks, replace sinks and finish basements. In one epic project, they plumbed all the houses to a new sewer line.
Ever since I moved to the reputedly friendly Midwest, I've been surprised not to find the neighborly spirit of my youth. Maybe, I decide, someone just needs to inject a little community spirit—someone with an ice rink to build. I pick a date when I think most people will be free—the day after Christmas—order the materials and spread the word.
Architect Dave Ferguson's computer-generated rink plans, which feature pinched-in corners to approximate an oval. The superiority of this design over a rectangular one became evident when the first puck zinged around the curve rather than lodging in a corner.

Built To Thrill
Boxing Day dawns at 15 degrees with the threat of light snow. As I gather my tools, I fret about who'll show up. I know I have enough hands to finish the setup in one day. In addition to Dave and Chris, another eager neighbor, Doug, even offers to split the $750 I spent on materials. But beyond us and our kids, who knows?
As I walk next door, I nearly drop my tools in awe. An army of adults and children—about two dozen in all—has gathered in the field. A few dogs have shown up too. The neighbors are shaking hands, making introductions and stomping their feet in the cold. Chris, who's standing in the middle of the animated group, catches my eye, and mouths, "Holy cow!"
"So what should we do?" a voice of undetermined origin asks. I'm unprepared for this. I hastily suggest that someone build a fire near the driveway so we can all warm our hands. Two people peel off, and the rest stare at me expectantly.
I shift my gaze to Dave, passing the buck. During their 58 years, he's mastered many skills, and their focus on building the rink is laser-like. But in terms of our approach to projects, Dave and I are like Oscar and Felix in The Odd Couple. I value speed over quality of craftsmanship. For the rink job, I just want ice; if the boards are uneven, so be it. Dave wants to build the rink with the precision of the Great Pyramid of Giza. At one point in our planning, I mention that I can't spare a whole week. They reply, "Well, it has to be right." Through their architect eyes, I imagine, Dave sees a backyard masterpiece—and me as a slacker with a rusty hammer. Dave has a plan. In addition to prescribing specific locations for each plank—2 x 6s on the uphill side, 2 x 12s at the bottom of the slope, and a combination of 2 x 8s and 2 x 10s along the sides—he wants to shape each board to conform to the ground's irregularities. This would remove any chance that the water-filled liner would bulge out and pop a leak. Their technique also promises a uniform edge all the way around.
Too finicky? Yes. But after all he's done to this point, I owe them the courtesy of following their plan. When they suggest that the two of us custom-fit the first board, to teach everyone else, I go along. As we mark, trim, test fit and retrim the lumber, our volunteers stand around, attempting to blow frosty smoke rings in the icy air. After a half-hour of tedious, finger-numbing work, Dave and I finish board one. The crowd dissents. "Skip the trimming—it's gonna take all day, and I've gotta drive my kid to practice later," says Sam from across the street. Nods all around. A walk-off strike looms. But Dave holds fast, claiming that once we get the process down, the rest will be easy.
That proves optimistic. Owing to frozen tufts of grass, our fitted pieces fail to eliminate the gap between the wood and ground. A tight fit would require hours of adjustments. Dave relents, saying, "This will take longer than I thought."
What's that I hear? A collective sigh of relief? Now all we need to do is place the boards according to Dave's blueprints, screw in the tie plates and drive the stakes. The crew splits into two work groups, and the yard beehives with activity. Chris's wife, Nancy, arrives with hot chocolate and doughnuts. As if cued by a Hollywood director, a light snow falls. Four hours later, with the planks securely in place, everyone races into the Browns' house to thaw out.
Finishing Touches
Who knew freezing water could be so complicated? When I researched rink building, the consensus seemed to be that obtaining billiard-table-smooth ice requires a multistage layering process. Pour in some water, let it freeze, add more water, and repeat until the desired depth is achieved. Most seemed to think that this is best done during an all-night session, when the sun won't slow the freezing. Crazy, right? Even an endless supply of my favorite frosty beverage wouldn't make a night spent with a garden hose remotely interesting. Given cold enough temperatures, water freezes. End of discussion.
After Chris and I staple the plastic to the boards the following day, we turn on the hose. Nearly 18 hours later, the rink is full but, Houston, we've got a problem. At the deep end, where the water is 10 inches deep, the pressure has forced the plastic through the gap between the wood and grass, and there's a trickling leak. We thought we had prepared for this by packing the gaps with snow, but it seems my quick-and-dirty approach has put the dirt on my face. Not ready to concede the superiority of Dave's fastidious methodology, I dash inside and check the forecast: temperatures in the teens or lower for the rest of the week. For the first time in my life, I rejoice in the cold. Over the next few days, I inspect the breach like a prison guard. By day three, it and the entire rink are frozen solid.
The job, however, is not done. The evening of our first skate, Dave drops by with a pair of spotlights mounted on 20-foot-tall boards. We secure the lights to the now-unused soccer goals. More donations pile in. Two benches appear alongside the ice. A neighbor from two doors away who missed the construction day presents a wide, sharp shovel perfect for clearing ice shavings. Another drops off a pile of hockey sticks and a bag of pucks. A week later, I fabricate two skating trainers out of PVC pipe (see diagram) for the beginners.
A plastic lawn chair can support beginning skaters while they learn to gain their balance on the ice. Even better, a custom-built trainer surrounds the skater and provides more stability. We cribbed this design from a local indoor rink, modified the dimensions for our kids and constructed it with 2-inch PVC pipe and fittings. Using sheet-metal screws instead of PVC cement imparts flexibility.
Skate-O-Rama
For a guy who waited 48 years to lace up their first pair of blades, Chris is now all about the ice. He's still shaky and lands on their backside so often we joke about calluses. But after four weeks, they never misses our Saturday morning adults-only hockey games. We have room for three-on-three play, and a couple of the neighborhood guys are so good we make them play with the small ends of their sticks. Without the rink, I would have had no way to find out about their hockey skills. Nor would I have discovered that Clayton had played offense and defense for the Michigan football team, or that Charlene once figure-skated competitively and can still perform dizzying pirouettes.
Except for the adult hockey games, the younger set rules the ice. Every evening I arrive home and am greeted by two kids dressed for action. The Browns generously institute an open-door policy, so the rink is always open. Most nights, there are a half-dozen kids and parents gliding around. Folks out walking their dogs stop by to have a look and say hello. Because of the rink, we've met more people in three months than we had the previous nine years. And this is during the winter, when we used to burrow indoors, a happy family, to be sure, but a family unto ourselves.
We used to curse the cold. Now we hope it lasts through April. When the ice melts, we'll drain the water, dismantle the rink and wait anxiously for the mercury to fall again.
In 2016, California Governor Jerry Brown tried to employ a kind of housing nuclear option that would have overhauled the way that San Francisco and other California cities build. In short, it would have forced San Francisco to build a lot more and a lot faster.
But the legislature quietly tucked away Brown's proposed law until it died from lingering too long without being acted on, at the behest of local governments who guard few things as closely as their right to be the gatekeepers of new construction.
Despite having been in California politics for longer than most of their constituents have been alive, Brown made a political error last year: Their plan was too specific, which gave lawmakers too much room to complain.
In their latest proposed budget (a $123 billion affair in all), it seems the governor learned their lesson.
Browm did resurrect their previous message. “Though demand has increased steadily, construction rates continue to lag,” Brown writes, linking the lag to a litany of state housing woes. “Although the state has a number of policies and programs in place to construct affordable housing [...] an increase in the housing supply [is] the most effective long‑term solution for reducing housing costs,” they continue.
But instead of putting forth a plan, Brown now asks lawmakers to jimmy up a package of new laws that will include some carrots for municipalities to speed up construction.
San Francisco's Assemblymember David Chiu already proposed paying cities that upzone areas within half a mile of public transit—which would seem to include almost the entirety of San Francisco.
Chiu's fellow SF Board of Supervisors alum, Scott Wiener, recently seated in the state senate, adopts a more aggressive tact: A Brown-style, streamlined building process that would kick in only for cities who fall behind building, and last only as long as it takes for them to catch up.
The governor would probably be amenable to either approach, or to both as part of a larger bill.
In the meantime, they warn that diminish tax revenue as boom times cool a bit and the threat of being starved of federal funds means sweet incentives might be harder to come by in years down the line.
But no matter what, all of these people have to go somewhere.

Religion News Service
(RNS) A long-standing tax break for clergy and other "ministers of the gospel" is facing the newest in a string of challenges in federal court.
The Wisconsin-based Freedom From Religion Foundation filed suit on Sept. 13 to challenge the constitutionality of tax deductions that clergy are allowed to claim on their housing expenses.
The tax break, called "a parish exemption," allows clergy to deduct income that is designated as a housing allowance, including rental payments and mortgage interest. Such allowances are a common way for religious congregations to boost the value of modest clergy salaries.
The suit names Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Douglas Shulman. The plaintiffs are Dan Barker and Annie Laurie Gaylor, co-presidents of FFRF, and Anne Nicol Gaylor, a past president and co-founder.
All three plaintiffs receive part of their salaries as housing allowances, but do not qualify for the tax exemption because they are
not clergy. That amounts to an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion, they claim, because the parish exemption aids and subsidizes religion by providing ministers with financial benefits not given to secular workers.
"The government is preferring ministers of the gospel over those of us who think religion should be, if not eliminated, limited," said Dan Barker, co-president of the FFRF.
Barker, a former ordained minister, has claimed the exemption in the past.
Grant Williams, a spokesperson for the Internal Revenue Service, declined to comment on any pending litigation.
The parish exemption entered the tax code in 1954, the same year the phrase "under God" was added to the Pledge of Allegiance. The country was deep in the Cold War and providing clergy with a tax break was seen as reinforcing religiosity in the fight against godless communism.
There have been several challenges to the parish exemption in recent years. In 1996, the IRS denied megachurch pastor Rick Warren a $79,999 deduction they claimed under the law, but Warren won on appeal. In 2002, Congress passed the Clergy Housing Allowance Clarification Act to protect the parish exemption, but limited it to the fair market rental value of a home.
The FFRF filed a similar suit in 2009 in California, but withdrew it earlier this year out of concern that their legal standing -- as
taxpayers -- was not strong enough.
After the FFRF began awarding all three plaintiffs a housing allowance within the past year to improve their standing in the case,
they hope the new suit demonstrates that they suffer real financial injury when they are denied the exemption.
Ohio lawmakers are considering a bill that would allow public high schools to give students credit for religious courses taken during school hours.
"I don't see religion being something we should be fearful of," said Monty Lobb, a professor of Business and Government at Ohio Christian University.
Lobb says too many students are leaving high school without knowledge of the countries' religious history.
"This plan would be voluntary," said Lobb. "It's off premises and there's no school money, no transportation that's involved in this."
Rep. Bill Patmon, a Democrat from Cleveland, said he's sponsoring the bill because "God has been taken out of the schools."
They say they want students to be taught ethics and to learn about a variety of religions.
They emphasized no public school money will be used.
But Gary Daniels from the American Civil Liberties Union says it could cause unforeseen issues.
"It could open up a bunch of Pandora's Boxes, let's say," said Daniels.
Daniels says awarding credit to a student who may be learning something that's opposite from what's being taught in the classroom is a bad idea.
"School districts can evaluate this using secular, non-religious criteria. With no religious tests," said Daniels.
Ohio would only be the second state, behind South Carolina, to allow this type of credit.
"My understanding is it would include world religions, so to me the more ideas you can have in the marketplace, the better off we are," said Lobb.
Patmon says they expect the bill to pass by the end of this year.

New Delhi, 13 April 2015: Post their Bronze Medal win at the 24th Sultan Azlan Shah Cup, the Indian Men Hockey team arrived at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in the midst of a rousing reception. The team post their back to back wins in the final three matches, bagged the Bronze medal in the all important tourney. Captained by Sardar Singh the team had a slow start to the tournament, but bounced back on time to clinch the 3rd position.
The Bronze is yet another achievement for the team post their Gold medal win in 17th Asian Games, Silver in the XX Commonwealth Games and a series win against the Kookaburra's in Australia last November.
Congratulating the team Dr. Narinder Dhruv Batra, President, Hockey India said, “I am proud of this team. The way they played and bounced back into the tournament to clinch the Bronze is amazing. The highlight was the win against Australia and this I think motivated them for the match against Korea. I congratulate the entire team for the Bronze.”
Speaking on the tournament, Chief Coach Paul van Ass said, “We started with not so good results but our boys recovered in a very well manner. Beating host team Malaysia boosted confidence of our boys and we got positive results from our new strategies and team combinations. As I was coaching Indian team first time in a tournament, they have surprised me with their high-level performance against Australia. It is good to see Team India in the Semi-Final of the tournament and I expect better performance in upcoming competitions.”
Speaking on the performance during the tournament, Captain Sardar Singh said, “Our team started slow in the tournament as we have given opportunities to some young players. But the best part is that these young boys recovered quickly from the early jolts. Though we came under pressure after disappointing results in the first few matches, but maintained same target to give the best in every match and our boys did the same. PR Sreejesh and Nikkin played brilliantly and they have raised their levels in the tournament. This is also our first tournament under Coach Paul van Ass and it was a good experience with him. We tried some new strategies and team combinations, which worked positively. The experience in the tournament will surely help us for our upcoming FIH Hockey World League.”

Summer grass:
That's all that remains
Of warriors' dreams.
–Basho
My favorite scientific experiments are those which resemble a haiku: simple and beautiful with a revelatory twist. This is why the haiku is very well suited for expressing scientific ideas in a poetic form. Contemporary haiku poets do not necessarily abide by the rules of traditional Japanese haiku, such as including a word which implies the season of the poem or the 17 (5-7-5) syllable structure of three verses. Especially when writing in a language other than Japanese, one can easily argue that the original 5-7-5 structure was based on Japanese equivalents of syllables and that there is no need to apply this syllable count to English-language haiku. Even the reference to seasons and nature may not apply to a modern-day English haiku about urban life or, as in my case, science.
Does this mean that contemporary haiku are not subject to any rules? In the introductory essay to an excellent anthology of English-language haiku, “Haiku in English: The First Hundred Years“, the poet Billy Collins describes the benefit of retaining some degree of structure while writing a haiku:
Many poets, myself included, stick to the basic form of seventeen syllables, typically arranged in three lines in a 5-7-5 order. This light harness is put on like any formal constraint in poetry so the poet can feel the comfort of its embrace while being pushed by those same limits into unexpected discoveries. Asked where they got their inspiration, Yeats answered, “in looking for the next rhyme word.” To follow such rules, whether received as is the case with the sonnet or concocted on the spot, is to feel the form pushing back against one's self-expressive impulses. For the poet, this palpable resistance can be a vital part of the compositional experience. I count syllables not out of any allegiance to tradition but because I want the indifference and inflexibility of a seventeen-syllable limit to balance my self-expressive yearnings. With the form in place, the act of composition becomes a negotiation between one's subjective urges and the rules of order, which in this case could not be simpler or firmer.
The seventeen syllable limit – like any other limit or rule in poetic forms – provides the necessary constraints that channel our boundless creativity to create a finite poem. It is a daunting task to sit down with a pen and paper, and try to write a poem about a certain topic. Our minds and souls are flooded with a paralyzing plethora of images and ideas. But, as Collins suggests, if we are already aware of certain rules, it becomes much easier to start the process of poetic filtering and negotiation.
What is the essence of a haiku? In the same essay, Collins offers a very elegant answer:
Whether they are the counting or the non-counting type, poets are likely to agree that at the heart of the haiku lies something beyond counting, that is, its revelatory effect on the reader, that eye-opening moment of insight that occurs whenever a haiku succeeds in drawing us through the keyhole of its details into the infinite, or to put it more ineffably, into the “Void of the Whole.” No one would argue that any tercet that mentions a cloud or a frog qualifies as a real haiku; it would be like calling an eleven-line poem about courtly love a sonnet. A true haiku contains a special uncountable feature, and every serious devotee of the form aims to achieve that with every attempt.
The revelatory surprise, the “Aha moment”, is what characterizes a true haiku. I have experimented with the haiku form, trying to capture scientific concepts or the process of scientific discovery. Many poets do not give titles to their haiku, but I feel that the title can be very helpful to create a poetic tension and provide a context that may be difficult to incorporate within the haiku verses. A haiku – like every good poem – should not require explanatory lines by the poet, but I think that one can make some exceptions here in the context of experimenting with haiku.
Scientific images or phrases are not always self-evident, so I include brief annotations for the haiku I have written which may be helpful for people who are not routinely exposed to the scientific research.
Mitochondria
Grainy threads in cells,
powerhouses of life are
harbingers of death
I have been studying mitochondria for a number of years, but I still marvel at the Janus-like role of mitochondria. They are active sites of biosynthesis and produce the universal energy molecule of cells (ATP) thus ensuring the growth and survival of cells. At the same time, mitochondria can initiate a cell's suicide program (apoptosis), forcing a cell to die. You can read about some of our mitochondrial research on lung cancer here.
Pipette
Ceci n'est pas une

for my macrodreams
Many of us have spent hours, days and months repetitively pipetting hundreds of samples for PCR reactions, ELISA assays or other tests, and sooner or later most of us wonder about the meaning of these Sisyphean tasks.
Progress
Most hypotheses
in science are tested only
to be rejected
If I received a dollar for every wonderful scientific idea I have had that turned out to be wrong, I would not have to write any more grants to support my lab.
Haiku have become an integral part of English language poetry, but there is another poetic form that may soon be gaining popularity. The journalist and poet Eliza Griswold recently teamed up with the photographer Seamus Murphy, traveled to Afghanistan and collected landays that are commonly composed by Afghani women in their native language Pushto. Landays are a form of folk poetry, couplets consisting of a verse with nine syllables followed by one with thirteen syllables. Griswold worked with native Pushto speakers to translate the landays into English. In their brilliant essay published in the June 2013 issue of Poetry Magazine, Griswold provides us with glimpses into the lives of Afghani women, the hardships that they face on a daily basis. The essay also contains translations of landays, which have become a form of lyrical resistance for Afghani women, allowing them to voice their anger and frustration. Illiterate women compose, share and recite these poems, often anonymously and behind closed doors, in society that marginalizes women. The narratives about Afghani women and the translations of landays, which preserve their characteristic wit and sarcasm, are accompanied by haunting photographs that convey the beauty of war-torn Afghanistan and its people.
Here is a description of landays from Griswold's essay:
A landay has only a few formal properties. Each has twenty-two syllables: nine in the first line, thirteen in the second. The poem ends with the sound “ma” or “na.” Sometimes they rhyme, but more often not. In Pashto, they lilt internally from word to word in a kind of two-line lullaby that belies the sharpness of their content, which is distinctive not only for its beauty, bawdiness, and wit, but also for the piercing ability to articulate a common truth about war, separation, homeland, grief, or love. Within these five main tropes, the couplets express a collective fury, a lament, an earthy joke, a love of home, a longing for the end of separation, a call to arms, all of which frustrate any facile image of a Pashtun woman as nothing but a mute ghost beneath a blue burqa.
Examples of landays collected by Griswold:
You sold me to an old man, father. May God destroy your home, I was your daughter.
I tried to kiss you in secret but you're bald! Your bare skull thumped against the wall.
I dream I am the president. When I awake, I am the beggar of the world.
In April of 2014, Griswold and Murphy will also release the book “I Am the Beggar of the World: Landays from Contemporary Afghanistan” which will contain a more comprehensive collection of landays.
Landays have not yet caught on as a poetic form in the English-language, but this landmark work by Griswold might change that. I think that landays might be a great opportunity for scientists to describe their experiences with the scientific enterprise.
My landays revolve around the work and lives of academic scientists:
A-Team
I work alone in the lab each night,
conducting all our experiments for your career.
Tenure Trek
Sirens of tenure captivate us,
chained to hallowed halls of academic freedom.
Glamour
Journals can make or break our careers,
careers can make or break us, we can make or break journals.
These landays attempt to approximate the 9-13 syllable count in the couplets but as with haiku, the nature, structure and themes of landays written in English will likely be different from the original Pushto landays.
It does not really matter what poetic form or structure scientists choose to express themselves, but my personal experience has been that poetry is a wonderful way to share science. Writing haiku or landays about science has forced me to think about what aspects of my scientific work I really treasure. What started as a playful exercise with words has become a journey.

ABC has had to re-schedule its LGBT miniseries When We Rise to make room for President Donald Trump. File this under “Ironic.”
Earlier this month, ABC announced it would schedule its groundbreaking miniseries across four consecutive nights, for maximum impact: February 27-March 2, from 9-11 PM each night.
But yesterday, House Speaker Paul Ryan announced at a news conference at the Capitol that they had invited President Donald Trump to address a joint session of Congress on February 28 (First addresses by a newly elected POTUS to the joint session of Congress are not officially called State of the Union Addresses). SOTU addresses typically take place at 9 PM because POTUS's are no dummies about HUT levels – especially not this TV-savvy one.
ABC announced this afternoon that, owing to ABC News' special report, President Donald Trump's Address to Congress, the When We Rise will air as planned on Monday, February 27, will take a break the next night while Trump speaks, and resume broadcsting two hours a night,Wednesday through Friday, March 1-3, from 9-11 PM.
When We Rise chronicles the real-life personal and political struggles, set-backs and triumphs of a diverse family of LGBT men and women, who helped pioneer one of the last legs of the U.S. Civil Rights movement from its turbulent infancy in the 20th century to the once unfathomable successes of today. It stars Guy Pearce as LGBT activist Cleve Jones, Mary-Louise Parker as women's rights leader Roma Guy, Rachel Griffiths as their wife, social justice activist Diane, Michael K. Williams as African American community organizer Ken Jones and Ivory Aquino as transgender activist Cecelia Chung.
At the recently wrapped TCA, When We Rise creator Dustin Lance Black told a dubious ballroom of TV critics and reporters, “If Donald Trump actually watches the show, they might like the show.”

Recently, there's been a lot of talk about energy storage being a "holy grail" for solving the problems of deeper renewables saturation in the U.S. power grid. It seems inevitable that someone will officially launch "Holy Grail Storage, Inc.," the term keeps getting thrown about so much.
I'm a big fan of energy storage innovation, and I do believe it's an important solution with big market potential.
But it's time to start pushing back on the rhetoric (from both proponents and, importantly, opponents of renewables) that often slips toward implying that energy storage is the only solution that matters for balancing the grid and renewables. That without such breakthrough innovations, renewables are inherently limited in the near term. Such rhetoric has gone way too far. It's an overstated vision being pushed right now for a variety of self-serving reasons (by utilities, innovators and investors, and then dutifully parroted by various journalists). [Editor's note: We banned the use of the term "holy grail" in energy storage articles at GTM several years ago.]
While it's true that cost-effective power storage is going to be a big boon when it does come to market, we simply do not need such innovations to achieve much more renewables penetration than we currently have in the U.S.
The facts are 1) the problem of intermittent renewables is overstated, at least at current generation-mix levels; and 2) there are a wide range of already-available solutions that greatly alleviate this problem anyway, without requiring additional storage innovations.
There are people out there with a motivation to paint renewables as being some kind of wildly variable power generation source that the grid cannot handle. These people would gladly have you believe that storage is a "holy grail," thus implying that we need to wait for it to be widely and cheaply available. And it's true, the sun doesn't always shine and the wind doesn't always blow when you need it. But let's remember that wind and solar (the dreaded "intermittents") together made up less than 5 percent of U.S. power generation as recently as 2013. Outside of a few specific geographies with high solar and/or wind penetration, this simply is not a big problem today. And there's plenty of headroom. An NREL study (note: link opens a big PDF file) calculated that, with better use of existing dispatchable power and storage technologies, the U.S. could go up to 50 percent penetration of wind and solar and keep the grid balanced.
One canard that these "intermittents" critics throw out there is the variability of a single solar or wind power generation facility. But while there's often correlation across generation sites (my roof is likely sunny when my neighbor's is, true), if you coordinate across a wide-enough range of generation facilities this variability smooths out a great deal. Germany has seen this, with an ability to manage a very deep penetration level of renewables already, somehow keeping the lights on in the process. So all these critics are really pointing out is that our grid in the U.S. is horribly balkanized and uncoordinated, on the whole. New storage tech is seen as a way of simply avoiding having to address this deeper problem, but that's not really the best long-term strategy, is it?
An underappreciated mitigating factor is that solar and wind, together, tend to smooth each other out. Wind profiles often show "shoulders" around dawn and dusk. Meanwhile, solar fills in the middle of the day. There are some great graphs in this Citi report (note: link opens a big PDF file), on pages 21 and 22 in particular, illustrating how this typically works out.
So the idea that renewables need a "holy grail" technology breakthrough to keep growing much beyond current levels is simply not true. There's lots of room for significant additional generation-mix penetration of solar and wind, for a long time, before any innovations to smooth out their intermittency will truly be necessary in the vast majority of geographies.
Plus, where intermittent renewables do cause problems, we're a long way from efficiently leveraging already-available solutions to alleviate them. Everyone seems to have forgotten that new battery techs are just one solution for addressing temporary imbalances between supply and demand.
First of all, we can simply better manage demand. Solar and wind conditions, while variable, are quite predictable. A truly smart grid can react to these variable conditions by automatically implementing demand response and ancillary services solutions that already exist, triggering them in response to near-term forecasts or just real-time conditions.
As Powerit Solutions found in an analysis (note: link opens a big PDF file) at a couple of industrial customer sites where solar was being installed, simply shifting loads around to eliminate spikes in net utility demand (as the sun shines or not, for example) could free up hundreds of kilowatts' worth of capacity at single facilities, without impacting productivity of their core business. Imagine rolling that type of solution across an entire utility territory and having such responses automatically triggered when it's a partly cloudy day or the wind isn't blowing quite when needed. Rooftop solar then dramatically shifts from being a threat to the stability of the grid, to being part of a stabilizing microgrid. Similar solutions exist for office buildings and homes, mostly around air conditioning/heating. [Rob Day is a partner at Black Coral Capital, an investor in Powerit.]
Doing this effectively would require much broader implementation and better coordination of these solutions than currently exists -- but these solutions already exist and could be easily implemented (and would also, by the way, save people money on their power bill). We do still need to see the ecosystem come together -- these solutions currently mostly exist in parts, rather than a holistic, single, standardized approach. But these industry partnerships are now starting to come together.
Second, natural gas has always played a "peaker" role in U.S. power generation and will continue to do so. This can happen as hybrid solutions at the individual power plant level, it can happen on the demand side of the grid, or we can just continue the current trend of adding traditional natural gas generation to the grid. Again, we see that we do not need new energy storage innovations to enable adding significant intermittent renewable power capacity to the grid; we can just leverage existing solutions to backfill for a long time to come. Natural gas and energy storage are natural competitors -- and natgas has a decades-long head start.
And third, let us not forget, we do have existing battery technologies that can be deployed today. Not at the price/performance levels needed for wide-scale unsubsidized standalone adoption, perhaps. But lithium-ion, lead-acid and other decades-old products, especially when matched with smart controls to optimize use of smaller batteries for more impact, are proven approaches with great potential for growth, even while newer tech is commercialized.
We need to stop the rhetoric around energy storage innovations being a "holy grail" right now for a couple of basic reasons. First, as can be seen from the above existing alternatives, it's simply not accurate to imply that the wait for major technological innovation is a significant roadblock to much, much more use of solar and wind than current levels. But secondly, as anyone who's observed the energy industry over the years can attest, it's simply not healthy to put so much weight on the emergence and broad-scale implementation of any single technology innovation happening anytime soon. It's bound to disappoint, as innovation and especially adoption always take longer than hoped. And why would we set ourselves up, as an industry, to appeared to have failed to deliver on such promises (again)? Remember when the solar industry was a "big failure"? We're still smarting from that one, even while solar power is one of the fastest-growing markets in the U.S.
Look, to reiterate, this is not an anti-storage innovation screed. Cost-effective storage fits into the smart grid story with really powerful benefits to the above solutions, or just as a standalone offering. Whether grid-scale storage (which the utilities like because it's centralized, controllable, and often can be added to their rate base for additional economic benefits for them), or demand-side storage for microgrids (which, if paired with rooftop solar and load control, can be a powerful "resiliency" solution for homes and businesses), this is an exciting area of innovation right now, both in terms of core storage hardware and the software/controls/services necessary to optimize the fully integrated solutions. Storage innovation is coming quickly and will be really valuable. There are quite a few really cool startups in this space right now, and some of them are going to be big winners.
But let's stop implying that we need breakthrough storage innovation or else solar and wind penetration must start slowing down anytime soon. We don't need to search for a holy grail to unlock the potential of renewables; that's already happening -- just look at the massive growth underway in the solar industry right now. We're reinventing the grid even before tomorrow's new batteries are ready, and we should be excited about that.
And by the way -- how did the search for the original Holy Grail end up?
Image caption The pavilion was destroyed by flooding in 2007
A sports pavilion destroyed by flooding more than six years ago has reopened after a £200,000 renovation project.
The club house at Oughtibridge War Memorial Sports Club, near Station Lane, was left unusable after the River Don broke its banks in June 2007.
Members of the cricket club and football team based at the ground attended the official opening.
The building work was funded by a Sport England grant of £62,000 and £136,000 from the club's funds.
Cricket club chairperson Chris Lingard said: "It is absolutely fantastic.
"The view is tremendous, both looking at the pavilion from the cricket square and from up on the balcony looking over the field."
Building work at the pavilion began in March 2012.
Zootopia surpasses the $500 million mark worldwide
Walt Disney Animation Studios has announced that Zootopia will surpass the $500 million mark globally today heading into its third weekend in the U.S., China, and Russia and its debuts in Australia and Brazil. It's the third consecutive Walt Disney Animation Studios release to reach this threshold following Frozen and Big Hero 6.
The film has earned $164 million domestically and $327 million internationally for a worldwide total of $491 million through March 17. In the U.S., the film has remained #1 through its first two weeks of release, dropping just 32% in its second weekend following its $75 million debut. Internationally, it's already Disney's biggest animated release ever in China, Russia, and Thailand. Major markets still to come include the UK on March 25 and Japan on April 23.
Yesterday, Zootopia earned $4.6 million domestically and $6.7 million internationally for a global total of $11.3 million for the day. Here are the international highlights by territory:
China $134.8M
France $24.3M
Russia $22.2M
Germany $15.9M
Korea $15.5M
Mexico $14.4M
Italy $11.7M
Spain $11.0M
Argentina $6.6M
Other $70.5M
Total $326.9M
Directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore and co-directed by Jared Bush, Zootopia takes place in the animal-filled city of the same name, as it follows optimistic Officer Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin). They discover that being the first bunny on a police force of big, tough animals isn't so easy. Determined to prove herself, they jump at the opportunity to crack a case, even if it means partnering with a fast-talking, scam-artist fox, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), to solve the mystery.
Other characters and the actors voicing them include Shakira as Gazelle, Idris Elba as Chief Bogo (head of the Zootopian Police Department), Octavia Spencer is Mrs. Otterson, J.K. Simmons is Mayor Leodore Lionhearted, Tommy Chong is Yax the Yak (“a most enlightened, laid-back bovine”), Nate Torrence is Benjamin Clawhauser, Jenny Slate is Assistant Mayor Bellwether (“a sweet sheep with a little voice and a lot of wool”), Alan Tudyk is Duke Weaselton (“a small-time weasel crook with a big-time mouth”), Raymond Persi is Flash (“the fastest sloth working at Zootopia's DMV — the Department of Mammal Vehicles”) and Bonny Hunt and Don Lake are the voices of Judy Hopps' mother and father, Bonnie and Stu (“a carrot farmer from Bunnyburrow”).
Sorry, neoliberals: Inequality is driven by greed, not technology A new study shows low wages are really caused by low minimum wage, weakened unions and the effects of globalization
Inequality may be the greatest economic challenge of our generation. Yet despite extensive academic debate, there is still no consensus as to its causes. Earlier this year, Tyler Cowen sparked a debate on the subject with their book "Average is Over," in which they argue that inequality is driven by new developments in technology that give some workers who can capably use the technology a wage premium over those who can't. Future innovations in technology, they argue, will contribute to hyper-meritocracy and further inequality.
Their argument echoes the conventional wisdom in economics, formulated by Lawrence Katz and Claudia Goldin, that skill-biased technological change can explain most of the increase in inequality. The premise is that technological developments have favored college-educated workers over unskilled labor, thereby increasing inequality. Since it was formulated, SBTC has drawn criticism. A 2002 paper by David Card first drew attention to potential holes in the explanation: a short period of stabilization in wage inequality in the 1990s during a technological boom and the failure to explain wage gaps between men and women as well as blacks and whites. A 2012 paper by Daron Acemoglu and David Autor noted other failures in the theory, namely that it could not explain the divergence in incomes that had occurred among skilled workers and why the real median wages could decline during a period of increasing productivity.

Now, Lawrence Mishel, Heidi Shierholz and John Schmitt have released a new study that questions SBTC as an explanation for increasing wage inequality. Mishel et al. argue that “job polarization,” the premise that more jobs have been created in low-wage sectors and high-wage sectors, thus driving wage inequality, doesn't actually explain the problem. On the one hand, high-wage occupations have not significantly expanded their share of the workforce since 2000. On the other, low-wage jobs have not increased as a total share of employment since 1979.
They find that changes in the occupation structure do not affect the wage structure, so if technology causes a shift from manufacturing to retail, this doesn't necessarily entail a shift in the wage structure. They find that inequality is increasing within occupations, not between occupations as the SBTC narrative would predict. The SBTC narrative relies on the idea of an “education premium,” i.e., people with higher education reap the benefits of technological progress. But Mishel et al. find that wage inequality has grown strongly since the mid-'90s while the education wage premium grew little. Wages for college graduates have flattened over the last 10 years, even among science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and business occupations.
The implications of the different visions are profoundly different. Cowen envisions, according to The Economist, a future largely stripped of middling jobs and broad prosperity. An elite 10-15% of Americans will have the brains and self-discipline to master tomorrow's technology and extract profit from it, they speculate. They will enjoy great wealth and stimulating lives. Others will endure stagnant or even falling wages, as employers measure their output with “oppressive precision.” Some will thrive as service providers to the rich. A few will claw their way into the elite (cheap online education will be a great leveler), bolstering the idea of a “hyper-meritocracy” at work: this “will make it easier to ignore those left behind.”
Mishel is more hopeful. After all, if inequality is the inevitable product of technological change, the only way to prevent higher inequality is to slow innovation. But Mishel is no Luddite. Their State of Working America 2012 report (co-written with Josh Bivens, Elise Gould and Heidi Shierholz) argues that it is economic policy, not changing technology, that drives wage inequality. The decreasing value of the minimum wage, the weakness of unions and the impacts of globalization have all coalesced to keep down wages.
The problem, then, is not machines, which are doing a great deal to boost productivity; the problem is that the benefits from increased productivity no longer accrue to workers. In a provocative paper earlier this year, Josh Bivens and Mishel argued that the gains for the richest 1 percent were due to “rent-seeking” behavior by CEOs and financial professions, not competitive markets. As John Kenneth Galbraith said, “The sense of responsibility in the financial community for the community as a whole is not small. It is nearly nil.” The newly minted rich want to blame robots for declining wages at the bottom and their innate superiority for their disproportionate share of the income. But these excuses mask their theft of productivity gains that rightfully belong to the rest of us.
If inequality were inevitable, as many on the right believe, we would expect to see inequality rising internationally. But, in truth, different societies have responded to inequality in different ways. I talked to Janet Gornick, professor at the Graduate from Center at CUNY and director of Luxembourg Income Study Center, about their work in the field of inequality. They tell me that “these transnational factors matter -- globalization, technological change, neoliberal reforms -- but what matters, perhaps more, are national-level policies and institutions. What is our evidence for that? Stark variation across relatively similar countries.” They tell me that some two-thirds of OECD countries have faced rising levels of inequality, however “the increase in inequality in OECD countries has been modest. The rise in the U.S. has been greater; there is something clearly going on at that national level, that is absolutely certain.”

Mishel echoes the sentiment: “Other countries have institutions which don't allow as much inequality -- a more robust welfare state, a strong role for collective bargaining, a stronger tax and transfer system.”
If inequality were the result of economic fundamentals, it would not matter who was in the White House, but rather inequality would be correlated to underlying economic trends. This is not true either. Larry Bartels finds in "Unequal Democracy" that income growth is more equal under Democratic presidents than it is under Republican presidents, pointing to the possibility that political systems drive inequality.
Since inequality is “man-made,” it can be ameliorated by changing our institutions. As Mishel said, “My interpretation that the outcomes we see are the products of policy decisions made or not made -- not raising the minimum wage, not reforming labor law -- is optimistic. We have it in our power to shape the future.” A recent article by Harold Meyerson in the American Prospect echoes this sentiment: “The extinction of a large and vibrant American middle class isn't ordained by the laws of either economics or physics. Many of the impediments to creating anew a broadly prosperous America are ultimately political creations that are susceptible to political remedy.” Blaming technology is an excuse to abdicate responsibility. Calling for more education and upward mobility, while noble, is useless when wages are falling for college graduates and will still leave many workers behind. Social mobility is good, but it shouldn't supplant the goal of reducing inequality (and it's unlikely that high levels of upward mobility can co-exist with rampant inequality). As Terry Eagleton writes in "Across the Pond," “As long as you have enough willpower and ambition, the fact that you are a destitute Latino with a gargantuan drink problem puts you at no disadvantage to graduates of the Harvard Business School when it comes to scaling the social ladder. All you need to do is try.”

Workers must exercise political power to change the institutions that shape their lives. Walmart doesn't have to pay its workers starvation wages and could easily pay them more. There is no celestial law that the richest 1% can plunder our common inheritance. We don't have to crush workers when we globalize and we don't have to destroy the environment in the pursuit of profits. Just as inequality is a choice, equality is a choice. By shifting the discussion away from the policy changes that have caused inequality, we legitimate it. As Eugene Debs said, “the class which has the power to rob upon a large scale has also the power to control the government and legalize their robbery.”
Through a coordinated media event, the Australian computer scientist Craig Steven Wright today claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin. Wright themselves published a blog post which they say cryptographically proves ownership of private keys Satoshi would have, which was covered by the BBC, The Economist and GQ, and backed by several prominent members of the Bitcoin community.
The greater Bitcoin community, however, remains skeptical of the claims, as much of the cryptographic evidence supplied by Wright has since been refuted or is unverifiable.
Perhaps most interestingly, three prominent members of the Bitcoin and digital currency space backed Wright's claim with their own blog posts. Two of them, former Bitcoin lead developer Gavin Andresen and former Bitcoin Foundation director Jon Matonis, traveled to London to meet Wright in person. Both claim Wright provided sufficient proof - including cryptographic proof - to convince them Wright is the man who invented Bitcoin. A third digital currency veteran – R3 architect Ian Grigg – followed up with a blog post confirming the revelation as well, and said Wright led a small team, which also consisted of Dave Kleiman, who died in 2013.
A large segment of the Bitcoin community remains skeptical of Wright's claims, however. Most important, as first discovered by Bitonic CEO Jouke Hofman, the cryptographic signature posted as proof by Wright turned out to be publicly available – not something only Satoshi would have known. The invalidity of this proof was later confirmed by both Bitcoin Core and Libbitcoin developers, with Bitcoin Core developer Jonas Schnelli even calling Wright out as a scammer.
In the wake of the news, the Bitcoin Core development team decided to revoke Andresen's commit access out of fear the former lead developer's account may have been hacked. However, at Consensus 2016 in New York, Andresen refuted these claims and confirmed they believe Wright really is Satoshi. Andresen also explained on Reddit that they had seen additional cryptographic evidence when they met Wright in London, but was not allowed to keep it.
Today is not the first time Wright has made headlines as the alleged inventor of Bitcoin. In December of last year, both Wired and Gizmodo outed the Australian as Satoshi Nakamoto. Nor is this the first time these claims have been disputed. Following the December revelations, large parts of the story were quickly challenged by Bitcoin developers and the wider Bitcoin community.
This story is developing and will be updated as more information becomes available.
ULUKHAKTOK, N.W.T. -- An odd-looking bear shot a few weeks ago by an Inuit hunter in the High Arctic is a rare grizzly-polar bear cross, scientists have confirmed.
Moreover, the animal -- with the creamy white fur of a polar bear, but with the big head, long claws and ring of brown hair around its hind common to the grizzly -- may be the first recorded second-generation “grolar bear” found in the wild, said the N.W.T. Environment and Natural Resources Department in a news release.
“A wildlife genetics laboratory has since conducted DNA testing on the samples, and the results of the testing point to the animal being a second generation hybrid bear which resulted from the mating of a polar/grizzly bear female with a male grizzly bear,” said the release.
Hunter David Kuptana shot the bear on April 8 while it roamed the sea ice just west of Ulukhaktok, on Victoria Island.
“The animal appeared unusual to the hunter and they provided samples from the bear to Environment and Natural Resources officials for testing to determine the species,” said the environment department.
Polar bear-grizzly hybrids -- known as either “pizzly” or “grolar” bears -- are very rare.
Although several suspected sightings have been made in that past few years, only one hybrid -- shot by a U.S. hunter in 2006 -- had been confirmed in the wild.
A warming climate has prompted hungry grizzly bears to increasingly move north, encroaching on polar-bear turf, according to experts. That migration means the two types of bear are expected to come into contact more often, competing for territory and, potentially, mating.

San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick (7) reacts after the Nov. 19 game against the Chicago Bears at Candlestick Park. The 49ers won 32-7. (Photo11: Kirby Lee, U.S. Presswire) Story Highlights QB Alex Smith, who suffered a concussion, is healthy but will not get their job back
Colin Kaepernick, pressed into the starter's role for two games, won both
Kaepernick has passed for 474 yards, three TDs and an interception
SANTA CLARA, Calif. — Colin Kaepernick only wants to play football, not stand in the middle of the league's biggest quarterback controversy.
Yet there they were Wednesday, their back against a concrete wall painted red and gold, answering questions from a gaggle of reporters who had just learned he, not Alex Smith, would start for the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday against the St. Louis Rams.
Said Kaepernick: "I'm just happy to be back out on the field."
ADDERALL: Does NFL have a problem?
A teammate, defensive tackle Ricky Jean-Francois, perched themselves on a stool to get a camera phone shot as the quiet, second-year quarterback was seemingly encircled as if by hungry sharks. Coach Jim Harbaugh told the team of their decision to go with Kaepernick on Wednesday morning, and players were still getting used to a decision expected by many.
"Sometimes guys who don't look good in practice ... they're just gamers," said receiver Michael Crabtree, describing Kaepernick. "I think that's how Alex is, I mean, Kaep is, at quarterback. They only knows one speed, and that's go."
Speed on their feet and speed on their fastball are Kaepernick's defining characteristics. Two starts and two victories —against the Chicago Bears and New Orleans Saints — were enough to unseat Smith, who was concussed Nov. 11 in an eventual tie with the Rams; he'd led the Niners to a 6-2 record to that point. But Harbaugh isn't calling Kaepernick their starter beyond Sunday's game in St. Louis.
"We've got two quarterbacks that we feel great about as a starting quarterback," Harbaugh said. "Both have earned it. What tips the scales is Colin has the hot hand, so we'll go with Colin ... and we'll go with Alex. They're both our guys."
Harbaugh would not speculate as to whether it was likely Kaepernick would be pulled if they struggle this weekend. San Francisco players seem to think the 49ers will be alright no matter who starts under center, and with good reason. While taking control of the NFC West, the 49ers (8-2-1) have leaned on running back Frank Gore (914 rushing yards) and a dominant defense.
"There's really no difference (between the two quarterbacks)," said tight end Delanie Walker. "I think Kaep is playing well right now. I think we feed off of it, and that's why he's getting the start."
Kaepernick was chosen by San Francisco with the 36th overall selection of the 2011 draft out of Nevada.  They are a native of Turlock, Calif., some two hours east of San Francisco. Smith, the team's on-and-off starter since being drafted No. 1 overall in 2005, had a 20-5-1 record as as the starter since Harbaugh took over in 2011. Smith has completed 70% of their passes this season, with 13 touchdowns and five interceptions.
Tight end Vernon Davis seemed to think there was an intangible difference between Kaepernick and Smith, referring to Smith as "still our guy" following a 31-21 victory in New Orleans in which Kaepernick generated two touchdowns. Said Davis after the game: "Harbaugh will make the right decision."
One tangible difference between Smith and Kaepernick is arm strength. Even Davis admitted Kaepernick throws a harder ball. The effect is twofold. The good: Kaepernick already has 10 pass plays go for 20 or more yards, compared to 22 for Smith in nine starts.The bad: Kaepernick has had 12.1% of their attempts dropped, most in the NFL, according to profootballfocus.com.
Neither Davis nor Smith were available to the reporters Wednesday. But other 49ers didn't seem to share Davis' opinion of the quarterback situation, at least not after Harbaugh made the call.
"Everybody here backs each other," said linebacker Aldon Smith, "and all we want to do is win. Harbaugh just wants to win. And whoever is in that pilot spot at QB, we have their back no matter what."
Crabtree shared a similar reaction: "Let's go play some ball."
They went on to add: "In this league I'm not surprised about nothing. Whoever the quarterback is, I'm just going to try and go make plays."
Spanish newspaper Marca have quite enjoyed the Paul Pogba saga. It's one of the biggest transfer stories ever, and Marca obviously wanted to be involved, telling the world Manchester United isn't Pogba's first choice.
Of course, Marca believe Pogba would have signed for Real Madrid, not Manchester United, had they been given the opportunity.
Now they accept that Pogba's arrival at Manchester United is close, Marca have used their Friday edition to once again state Real Madrid was where the player wanted to go.
They also point out that Manchester City agreed a deal with Juventus to buy the player last August, but Pogba themselves turned the opportunity down.
They didn't want to move at the end of a transfer window, and was waiting for further opportunities this summer.
Just so long as we're all aware Madrid was what Pogba wanted, Marca will be happy.
NEW DELHI: In a first of its kind of green development initiative, two Andhra villages, Toorputallu and Pedhamyanavanilanka , will be electrified completely on solar power from this year."These will be the first two villages in the country to be run 100 per cent on solar power," said Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who has adopted these two villages under the Sansad Aadarsh Gram Yojna ( SAGY ).A 2 MW solar power plant will be developed by a private entity and the power generated by the plant will be bought by Andhra Pradesh discom APEPDCL."Pedhamyanavanilanka & Toorputallu (Andhra). Serving PM Shri @narendramodi's call for use of solar power," Sitharaman tweeted.As per the proposal, the district administration has earmarked the required land and APEPDCL has consented to buy power from the developer. The solar plant will be completed by August 2016.The plant would also generate substantial income for the village - 60 paise per unit.The SAGY was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It is an ambitious village development project under which each Member of Parliament will take the responsibility of developing physical and institutional infrastructure in three villages by 2019.

NewSound TI-100-LT In-Ear White Noise Machine and Tinnitus Masker Features and Benefits: In-ear white noise machine provides three way defense against noise: Raises hearing threshold, Masks noise, and Blocks noise (like an ordinary ear plug.)
Universal fit devices fit most people and are small enough to wear through the night comfortably
Replaceable foam ear tips included in two sizes to fit most users comfortably, and block much of the noise in your environment
Silicone, non-noise-blocking ear tips are included for use as a tinnitus masker you can wear throughout the day
Fingertip volume control means no tools required
Full range volume adjustment, from inaudible to a safe all day or all night maximum of 83 dB, making TI-100-LT the perfect tool for tinnitus management, or masking loud noises in the night to help you sleep soundly.
Powered by standard 10A hearing aid batteries (included).
30 day free replacement guarantee for defective units, plus a one year $25 repair warranty included.
What's in the box: One or Two TI-100-LT devices (depending on the item you ordered), two pairs of foam tips (one large, and one small), two pairs of silicone tips (one large, and one small), sturdy carry/storage case, card of batteries, and instructions. We want you to have the most cost-effective solution to your noise problem, so before you spend the money for any in-ear white noise device, if you have not already done so, we strongly suggest that you first try ordinary foam ear plugs. We have found that most people suffering with noise in the night, can get the relief they need by using a simple foam ear plug. The trick is to make sure you know how to get foam ear plugs properly and deeply inserted (see the video-will open in a new window.)
...and when ear plugs just are not enough, give the TI-100-LT a try. All you have to lose is a lot of sleepless nights!
One more thing...if you are a side sleeper, you might consider adding an ear pillow to your order. These pillows have a hole where your ear goes that eliminates any pressure on your ear that may be caused by lying on your side with the TI-100-LT in place. Most do not need the pillow, but some do, and we make it available in case you might need it.
Now Available in Regular and LT Versions
How do I choose?
Now you can choose between the original TI-100, which we developed primarily for noise management during sleep and the new TI-100-LT, which doubles as a tinnitus masker as well as helping manage noise during sleep. There are just a few differences between the two models. First, the original TI-100 has a tiny trimmer to adjust the volume, which requires a tool (included), and the volume is adjustable from a low of about 70 to a high of 83 dB. Our customers have told us that 70 dB is too high a minimum volume level for use as a tinnitus masker, so we developed the TI-100-LT to address this issue. The TI-100-LT has a fingertip volume adjustment, so no tool is required, and the volume is adjustable from inaudible to a maximum of 83 dB so you can use as little or as much sound as you need, and then change the volume easily whenever you need to do so. The LT version offers just one comfortable masking sound and is, therefore, less expensive than the TI-100, which offers 4 different sound profiles. The multiple sound profiles can be of great benefit in helping you find the right masking sound during sleep in your unique situation.
In summary, we suggest you choose the TI-100 if you are using it exclusively for sleep as it provides the four different sound profiles which can be helpful in addressing your unique sleeping with noise challenge.
If you are using the device primarily, or even partly as a tinnitus masker, we suggest you choose the TI-100-LT, because it gives you greater control over the volume setting which is crucial to this application: you should only use the minimum volume necessary to manage your tinnitus.
Finally, if you need the devices for sleep and you are on a tight budget, go ahead and get the TI-100-LT. The sound it produces is a nice mid-range masking sound that will almost certainly work for you. We have sold hundreds of SnoreMasker Pros over the more than ten years we were able to get them, and these were a single sound device, much like the new TI-100-LT.

Khiry Robinson New Orleans Saints open their OTAs
Khiry Robinson (29) hopes to become a key contributing running back as the New Orleans Saints open with their first of ten practice sessions as part of the teamas 2014 Organized Team Activities (OTA), Wednesday, May 28, 2014. (Photo by Ted Jackson, Nola.com | The Times-Picayune)
Around this time last year, New Orleans Saints running back Khiry Robinson didn't strike fear in opponents. Nor did they inspire much interest among pundits analyzing the team's 2013 outlook.
The undrafted rookie out of West Texas A&M didn't even have the correct label next to their name. In the first offseason rosters handed out by the team, they were listed as a wide receiver.
Robinson was another name in a sea of hopefuls who desired to make an impression on Saints coaches during a three-day minicamp.
Most did not.
Out of the 30 players who showed up to camp on a tryout basis that weekend, Robinson was the only one to stay there through OTAs, mandatory minicamp, training camp and finally the cutdown to the 53-man roster.
Robinson said they felt like they were a first-year student in high school or college all over again at the start of that first minicamp.
"It was a lot more being thrown at you than in college," Robinson said of last summer. "I've got to learn all these plays in three days, like at rookie camp. It's kind of all slowing down for me now, I'm getting the hang of it. It's a big difference than last year."
Last year, Darren Sproles, Pierre Thomas and Mark Ingram had three spots sewn up before training camp even began. The fourth, and presumably only spot, was expected to come down to Robinson or Travaris Cadet, who was going into their second season.
The Saints carried five running backs in 2012, but a crowded backfield bounced Cadet from running back to wide receiver and back again. Five running backs in 2013 was not a virtual certainty.
When it came down to it, the Saints couldn't part with Robinson, who showed enough in training camp for the team to take a chance.
Robinson is one of those rare success stories that aren't really so rare anymore in New Orleans. In the Sean Payton era, at least one undrafted free agent has made the Saints final 53-man roster every year.
Robinson's success with the Saints came in spurts. They were inactive for two games, got sparse touches for four weeks while Mark Ingram was injured, and then went back to the sideline for six more weeks.
Robinson scored their first touchdown in Week 5 against the New England Patriots, but their real breakout didn't come until Week 17. In the final three games of the season, including the playoffs, they rushed for 152 yards and a touchdown.
One year later, Robinson has the upper hand.
"You see him, just from an assignment standpoint, understanding the protections much quicker. That took a while for them last year," Payton said. "I think (with) a year under their belt, the overall understanding of all the things they need to do at the running back position is a lot better. I think a young player, a running back in particular, the running part of it is something that would be the easier part. The protections and the different things that go into the (blitz) pickups are more challenging.  They are a lot further along than they were this time last year."
Cadet, who took only 24 offensive snaps last season, is in consideration for a hybrid Sproles-type role.
Thomas recently took a pay cut to stay with the Saints, and Ingram is going into a contract year. That means Robinson, 24, could be the long-term solution at running back.
Everything is a bit easier for Robinson this year. He's not the new guy in the fold. They have an easy camaraderie with their teammates that only comes with time.
Once a self professed shy guy who practically had to be drugged in front of TV cameras, Robinson is now more comfortable in their own skin.
"He is someone obviously that has more confidence now," Payton said.
All those things help off the field. But on the field, they know they still have a lot to learn.
Three games doesn't make a superstar. Not yet. Not when teams now have game film of them to study.
"Last year I was basically just running, hoping I went the right way," they said. "Now I feel like I've got the concepts down."
Robinson kept their head buried in their playbook last summer. Despite their familiarity with the offense this year, they don't expect that to change anytime soon.
"Gotta study that playbook a whole lot more," they said. "This is my second year so I've got to be prepared for anything, whether it's getting more playing time or being in a different position."
Robinson changed up their routine this offseason, running more hills to build stamina and upping their workouts to two times a day.
There are high expectations for Robinson, undoubtedly. But they don't mean much to a player still scratching and clawing their way up the depth chart.
"I'm not content yet," Robinson said. "I'm not a starter or anything like that. I can't get comfortable."
Mathematics should be compulsory for all students staying on at school after the age of 16, regardless of what subjects they are studying at A level, according to a report by a parliamentary committee.
The House of Lords science and technology committee said that improving numeracy among school leavers was not only increasingly important to employers, but would address the growing problem of students starting undergraduate degrees without having the requisite maths skills.
The committee's report also said that the government should ease its strict immigration caps, introduced in recent years to reduce net migration to the UK. The restrictions threatened the ability of UK universities to attract the best students from outside the European Union, said the Lords, and led to a perception that the UK does not welcome foreign students.
The recommendations are published today as part of the committee's inquiry into the quality of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) subjects in higher education – and whether the standards meet those required by industry. The peers called for urgent action from government to encourage more young people to study the subjects at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, as a way to underpin the UK's future economic growth.
Lord Willis of Knaresborough, who chaired the inquiry, said that the lack of mathematical skills was a big concern. "Many commentators would now say that our mathematics in school is really glorified numeracy," they said. "In order to move on to understand mathematical concepts, to use mathematics appropriately, we need to bring in far greater rigour and that needs to continue until students finish their education or training."
Willis said that vice chancellors had given evidence to the inquiry that their first year undergraduates had major problems with mathematics. "When you've got the vice chancellor of Cambridge saying that we get nothing but A* students coming in and yet we have to do remedial mathematics for them to engage with engineering and physics, there is something seriously wrong with the system."
Willis praised the Scottish Highers system as a model for how post-16 maths education in England and Wales might be evolved. "We're wanting to see, as an automatic part of your post-16 study, that you will have a maths component which is appropriate, in terms of level and content, to what you're studying."
The inquiry also raised the effect that recent changes to immigration policy were having on universities. "We cannot stress enough how important it is in key subjects like engineering, attracting overseas undergraduates and postgraduates into the UK. Imperial College [said] that 34% of their undergraduates are from non-EU, 64% of their postgraduates are non-EU," said Willis.
"We have disagreed significantly with the government's current policy and we have recommended that the government should make a distinction in the immigration statistics between higher education students and other immigrants and uses only the latter category to calculate net migration."
Philip Greenish, chief executive of the Royal Academy of Engineering, said the failure in the UK to get enough young people to engage with mathematics after 16 was self-evident. "The Select Committee report shows that the UK must improve post-16 maths so that students are properly prepared for the demands of science and engineering degrees. There can be no greater priority for our education system and the future of UK growth."
Imran Khan, director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering, said that the breadth of the peers' concerns showed that science and engineering had not had an easy ride over the past few years, as had sometimes been assumed.
"If the government adopts the report's recommendations, including some serious analysis of what skills employers need compared to what our higher education sector is actually producing, we might get a genuinely joined-up strategy for Stem education – which is what the UK is desperately going to need if we're to be competitive in tomorrow's high-tech economy."

“The use of secret waitlists by VA employees to hide actual wait times resulted in the delay or denial of veterans' access to timely care” Ayotte said Wednesday. “It's outrageous that employees who deliberately manipulated waitlists received bonus pay, and they must be held fully accountable for their misconduct - starting with repaying the funds they wrongly received.”

The senators said some Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) employees wrongly received these bonuses because compliance with wait-time metrics was a factor in determining employee bonuses.
“I'm pleased this bipartisan legislation will hold responsible any VA employee found to have cooked the books on wait times, and will help us quickly recover bonuses and raises paid to those fraudsters with taxpayer dollars,” McCaskill said.
Their bill directs the VA secretary to require employees who received bonuses in 2011 or later to repay them if they removed a veteran's name from a healthcare waitlist. The employee's superiors would also be required to pay back bonuses if they knew, or should have known, of the actions.
The administration has been investigating the VA claims system and backlog. It has found that some facilities have falsified information on wait times.
House and Senate conferees are working on bicameral legislation to address the problem. The bill would give the VA secretary more flexibility to fire those involved in the scandal and allow some veterans to seek medical care outside the VA system.
Progress toward a more gender-neutral environment is being made nation-wide at college campuses by creating awareness of ways to foster inclusivity on campus.
Through the last couple of decades there has been a growing movement for people to become more inclusive with the language they use. The first strides being made were within occupational pronouns, like police officer to be changed to police officer and flight attendantess to flight attendant.
However with the transgender community now getting more positive media attention than ever, people have begun new conversations about inclusivity and gender.
Inside the CSUN Pride Center, 22-year-old junior Brittany Combs sat alongside Gabriele Cendoroglo, a 24-year-old sophomore, as they discussed their views on gender pronouns.
“I don't really find them relevant and I wish that there was a pronoun other than ‘they' or ‘their' to describe people who don't prefer ‘he' or ‘she' pronouns,” Combs said. “I feel like I am kind of in the middle somewhere, but I don't necessarily feel like identifying with ‘he' pronouns or ‘she' pronouns and ‘they' is more assumed to be more than one person. I feel like I dehumanize myself when I use that pronoun.”
Combs, who prefers Brittany but is fine with the “they” pronoun, said that no professor on campus ever asked students which pronoun they preferred, not even in their queer studies class, added Cendoroglo.
“I don't even question my gender until somebody else tries to question it. I just pretend it doesn't exist half of the time,” Combs said. “I know we are still in the exploration stages, and personally I've been still figuring myself and trying to since I was 13. I could just be all of the above, but I keep on trying to narrow it down and it's hard. It just doesn't work.”
Outside of the USU, and more specifically the Pride Center, many students needed a further explanation of what is meant by gender-neutral pronouns. However, while most students took a while to grasp the concept, there was a positive response of acceptance and respect to those students on campus.
“I think we should just have one word for everybody, but also I think gendering pronouns has something to do with separating women and men. I think that there is no reason for pronouns to be gendered. I think that they just shouldn't exist,” Cendoroglo said. “Even in a cis environment, it can be oppressive to women. ‘That's what they said' is a joke. Gender pronouns are bad in both trans and cis communities.”
According to GLAAD, “‘cis-‘ is a Latin prefix meaning ‘on the same side as,' and is therefore an antonym of ‘trans-.'”
Earlier this year, College Magazine came out with their top 10 list of the most transgender-friendly campuses.
Colleges like University of Tennessee, Harvard University, Vanderbilt University, American University, University of Vermont and Duke University have been in the news for their efforts to create a more gender-neutral environment for their students.
According to the LA Times, applicants to the University of California will have six different gender identities to choose from: male, female, trans male, trans female, gender queer/gender non-conforming and different identity.
While CSUN has not made this kind of strides, the campus has made efforts to create a community for students at the Pride Center. Trans week, celebrated Nov. 14 through 20, is one example of outreach from the campus community.
Through the Pride Center, 18-year-old first-year student Ron Villarreal has learned more about the issue.
“I have been aware in the past, but I didn't put too much though until just last week for trans awareness week,” Villarreal said. “I feel like it solidified the idea about pronouns that I had. I feel like with pronouns, it has a lot to do with respect and acceptance. If somebody prefers a certain way to be identified, then you should respect that. It doesn't matter how you perceive them but how they perceive themselves and how they want to be preferred.”
The Pride Center created a sheet of Queer Terminology to help students become familiar with their proper definition. In 2011, CSUN approved four single gender-neutral bathrooms. Since its opening in 2012, the Pride Center has grown to include many options for our LGBTQAIQ community. CSUN has recently offered a name change form in which students may write their preferred gender pronoun.
Arin Flores, a 22-year-old junior said, “I have yet to submit the preferred name form because I want to do it after finals, because I don't want to have an awkward encounter. It's a new thing that admissions and records is doing.”
The Ally Project at CSUN provided a list of terms to get familiar with to help expand one's personal knowledge. Students who are active with the Pride Center said it is important to get educated so one can have a better understanding.
Although many students on campus may not be aware of the preferred gender pronouns other than “he” or “she,” many people recognize them and feel comfortable with using them.
Amir Ranjbar, a 20-year-old sophomore, said “I wouldn't mind calling people ‘he,' ‘she,' ‘they,' or whatever they would like, to be honest.”
Given that I spent a long time in Asian martial arts, it's no wonder why it is I like forms. While I have some misgivings about their usefulness in empty handed fighting arts, I think they are often essential for those arts that concern themselves with weapons. For this reason I have been thoroughly enjoying learning Antonio Manciolino's first assault for the sword and buckler, and it's had me thinking about the various things a preset pattern can teach you.
When I was doing eastern martial arts, I remember being told that certain parts of a form were for specific situations. “This part of the form is used against a very aggressive opponent,” my sifu would tell me, “whereas this part is for someone that you have on the ropes, and you're chasing them down.” In this way you could learn different tactics and lessons just from doing one exercise, which I found to be quite valuable in its own way. This kind of experience with training exercises makes me wonder if the same kind of thought process could apply to the Bolognese assalti, with each section teaching different fundamental lessons and strategies. With this in mind, I started looking at the first section of Manciolino's first assault, and I think that there is a very specific lesson being taught here.
Here is the section I'm referring to. For the record, I am using Tom Leoni's work “The Complete Renaissance Swordsman”, as my reference:
1.) Pass with the right foot obliquely towards your right side, while delivering a falso against the boss of your buckler and going into Guardia Alta, with the buckler held in front of your face like a mirror.
2.) Pass forward with the left foot and perform a ritocco of the buckler, placing your sword in Guardia di Testa and lowering your buckler alongside your left thigh.
3.) Pass forward with the right foot and lift your sword into Guardia Alta.
4.) Pass forward with the left foot, executing a montante accompanied by a mandritto Sopra il Braccio, and getting into Guardia di Testa.
5.) Pass forward with your right foot, hit the boss of your buckler with a falso and execute a montante up to Guardia Alta.
6.) Then, you have the embellishment:
a. Throw your right foot behind the left while cutting a fendente into the rim of the buckler; let the sword continue downward and behind you all the way up into Guardia Alta.
b. Pull your left foot behind the right and perform a ritocco of the buckler.
c. Pass forward with your left foot into a wide stance, getting into Guardia di Testa.
d. Pass forward with your right foot hitting a falso into the boss of your buckler.
e. Life a montante into Guardia Alta pulling your right foot next to the left, and making sure that your buckler keeps your head well defended.
Manciolino uses this exercise as a way to enter against an opponent, and I think there are two main lessons being taught in this section:
1.) Manciolino is backing up their earlier advice that, as one approaches your enemy, you should never stay static in your guard.
“While you and your opponent are studying each other, never stop in a particular guard, but change immediately from one guard to the next. This will make it harder to judge your intentions.”
This is simple and usable advice, but how many people actually do it? If you look at most HEMA matches, many practitioners stay static in a guard they feel comfortable in, making it very obvious what it is they are capable of doing, and what they are likely to do in response to the other fencer's actions. Sometimes even experienced fencers will change guards at an improper time, leaving an obvious tempo for attack, and this also causes problems. I would argue that, in learning the first section of the assault, one of the lessons that is being driven home is that you must always transition between guards as you approach, and your cuts will be the vector for those transitions. As a side note, this is very similar to the rule often cited in German sources where you do not cut without stepping, and you do not step without cutting.
What an exercise like this provides is a basic blueprint for certain actions. Oh, you're approaching your opponent, but you aren't sure what guard to take or how to move into it? Remember your assault, and you will know the basics of that.
2.) Manciolino, in my opinion, is also teaching a way to intimidate an opponent as you are coming in. Admittedly, I could be right or wrong on this one, because I have not yet finished reading Manciolino's treatise, and perhaps they give a yea or nay on that one later on, but I would be willing to argue, from what I know so far, that the graceful and aggressive comportment shown in the assault, and the fluid guard transitions within, is being used as a way to discourage your opponent, and show them you are “serious business”.
In this way, just by doing the introduction and embellishment of the assault, a student can work on two (or potentially more) important lessons, as well as work on the basics of footwork, guard transition, and cutting.
The adventure continues.
Cheers.

Support Provided By Learn More NASA, ESA, and the Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA)
cosmic gems
Other meteoritic diamonds apparently hail from deep space. In 1987, a team of researchers headed by Edward Anders and Roy Lewis of the University of Chicago reported the discovery of meteorite-embedded diamonds so miniscule that trillions could fit on the head of a pin. Unlike the Smithsonian diamonds, these microscopic crystals contain an isotopic mixture of xenon gas not found on Earth. "It seems necessary to invoke an extra-solar origin for the diamond," the scientists concluded in a paper published in Nature , indicating a birth outside our solar system.
Indeed, the team proposed that the lucent crystals formed in the atmosphere of a "red giant" or dying star before it collapsed and exploded billions of years ago. The supernova would have sent the diamond-studded material far out into space, where in the fullness of time some pieces eventually fell to Earth. If this scenario is correct, the researchers said, then interstellar dust may be peppered with tiny diamonds.
Still other diamonds are apparently created during the fiery instant when meteors and meteorites slam into Earth. In the 1960s, scientists discovered more microscopic diamonds in the remains of the vast Canyon Diablo meteorite, which formed Meteor Crater in Arizona. The diamonds are sand-grain-sized, only hundredths of an inch across. Other crater-related diamonds are larger. In the 35-mile-wide Popigari crater in Siberia, the result of a huge impact 35 million years ago, Russian researchers unearthed polycrystalline diamond clusters reaching nearly half an inch across.

Many of these impact-spawned diamonds bear the cubic structure of ordinary, Earth-grown diamonds. But analysts studying the Canyon Diablo diamonds found that up to a third of them bore a hexagonal atomic structure never before seen in diamond. Mineralogists named the new hexagonal variant of diamond lonsdaleite after the British mineralogist Dame Kathleen Lonsdale, who helped advance the study of natural diamond crystals.
Origins unclear
Today, more than 30 years after the discovery of the Canyon Diablo diamonds, scientists still debate how such mini-diamonds form. Some suspect they were wrought in the vacuum of space by vapor deposition, a process that specialists can use to make synthetic diamond here on Earth. Others maintain that, within the hurtling meteorite itself, carbon atoms (or, in a minority opinion, grains of meteoritic black graphite) transformed instantly into diamond during the extraordinary heat and shock of impact.
Even nearby planets may be churning out diamonds.
Whatever the origin of meteorite diamonds, some scientists believe they have found evidence that the colossal cloud of dust thought to be thrown up into the atmosphere in the wake of such impacts may spread newly formed diamond dust all around the world. In 1991, Canadian geologists David B. Carlisle and Dennis R. Braman reported finding Lilliputian diamonds embedded in a layer of sediment 65 million years old—right at the time when many scientists believe a giant meteor slammed into Earth and precipitated the extinction of the dinosaurs.
Can these miniature diamonds, which are so fine-grained that the researchers deem them the result of a collision, serve as an indicator of this ancient catastrophe, much as the famous iridium layer has done? Scientists won't be able to say without further study, but the idea holds promise. (In the 1998 book The Nature of Diamonds, the geologist George Harlow and two Russian colleagues wrote simply, "This subject is very new, and many exciting discoveries have yet to be announced.")
For scientists, the allure of carbonados, otherwise known as black diamonds, lies not in their look but in their age and origin. Steve Haggerty
black diamonds
Outer space may also be the birthplace of the mysterious black diamonds known as carbonados. From the Portuguese word for burned or carbonized, carbonados were first found in Brazil in the 1800s and have since turned up elsewhere, most notably in central Africa. Unlike the clear diamonds of engagement rings, which are single crystals, black diamond consists of aggregations of individual crystals, which lend the gem its dark color. The largest diamond ever found was a carbonado from Brazil. Named Sergio, the stone weighed 3,167 carats. (One carat equals one-fifth of a gram.)
The origins of carbonados have long baffled scientists. Black diamonds don't adhere to the rules of diamond mineralogy, and they don't occur in the usual places where clear diamonds turn up. Even so, scientists initially believed they must have been fashioned in the same conditions under which clear diamonds are thought to form. That is, they were crafted deep within the Earth, 100 to 300 miles down, when intense heat and pressure transformed carbon into diamonds, which volcanic eruptions then lofted to the surface.
But that theory suffered a blow when scientists examined the carbon isotopes of black diamonds. (Isotopes are species of a chemical element that reside in the same place on the periodic table but have different atomic weights and physical properties.) Unlike clear diamonds, black diamonds feature ratios of the two most common carbon isotopes in the Earth's crust, carbon-12 and carbon-13. These isotopes characterize surface carbons rather than those found in the Earth's depths.
Did carbonados form in the unimaginably explosive shock waves emitted by dying stars, such as the one whose death throes created the Eskimo nebula (seen here)? NASA, Andrew Fruchter and the ERO Team, Sylvia Baggett and Zoltan Levay (STScI), Richard Hook (ST-ECF)
Wherefrom?
This finding helped lead to a new theory of carbonado formation. In 1985, Joseph Smith of the University of Chicago and J. Barry Dawson of the University of Sheffield in England suggested in an article published in the journal Geology that large meteor impacts in the Precambrian Era (570 million years ago back to Earth's beginning some 4.5 billion years ago) formed the black diamonds we find today. Scientists had long deemed carbonados quite old, because the streams where they are typically uncovered cut through geologic strata dated from one to more than two billion years old. In fact, recent atomic measurements of black diamonds have placed their origins at nearly four billion years ago, a time when a constant barrage of giant meteors battered the Earth.
In the 1990s, other scientists showed that Brazilian and African carbonados bear similar isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, suggesting a common origin, while still others provided theoretical and physical evidence that black diamonds could have arisen during the extreme shock and heat of a meteor impact. But why, some scientists wondered, had no unambiguous evidence ever been shown for craters associated with carbonados?
As for tapping the riches of any diamonds from space, don't hold your breath.
Geologist Stephen Haggerty of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst had an idea why, and they shared it with a dumbfounded audience at a 1996 American Geophysical Union meeting in Baltimore. Carbonados were born not on Earth, either the way regular diamonds are or by meteor impact, they said. Rather, they originated in dying stars, when shock waves from exploding red giants crushed carbon into dense aggregations of black diamond and sent them hurtling into deep space. Eons later, the sun's gravity lured some of this material into our solar system, where blocks of it slammed into our atmosphere, shattering into the fragments we find strewn over select areas today, perhaps billions of years after they formed.

Lucid in the sky with diamonds
Even nearby planets may be churning out diamonds. In fact, planetary scientists say that Uranus and Neptune, the seventh and eighth planets from the sun, may rain diamonds, which then pile up miles-thick at the planets' cores.
Uranus and Neptune are each nearly four times the size of Earth. Scientists believe that, beneath an outer layer of hydrogen and helium, the gaseous atmospheres of both planets contain 10 to 15 percent methane, a hydrocarbon. Deep within the extremely dense atmospheres, above a rocky core, these planets are also thought to bear temperatures ranging from 3,000 to 12,000°F and pressures varying from 200,000 to 6,000,000 times the pressure of our own atmosphere.
In other words, possibly ideal conditions for producing diamonds.
With this in mind, a team at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory tested in the early 1980s what would happen to methane under intense pressure. One of the team's leaders, Marvin Ross, had calculated that the gas would separate into hydrogen and carbon at temperatures above 3,000°F and pressures exceeding 200,000 Earth atmospheres. The carbon atoms would be squeezed so tightly together that they would become diamonds, they theorized.
To find out if they were right, Ross and their team used a gas cannon to severely compress and shock methane samples. Resulting data, they later reported, indicated the fleeting formation of diamonds in the instant before the target material evaporated, and recent experiments at several labs support the predictions.
For the foreseeable future, the greatest benefit we'll see from diamonds in the sky will be increased scientific knowledge. NASA, Don Figer, STScI
Reaping the benefits
As for tapping the riches of any diamonds from space, don't hold your breath. Earth-hitting meteorites that either bear or engender diamonds are few and far between, and unlike diamonds you're likely used to, their associated diamonds often cannot be seen, much less admired, with the naked eye. Black diamonds, for their part, are rare and are primarily used for industrial purposes. And the challenges of harvesting any diamonds on Uranus and Neptune, which are roughly 1,700 and 2,720 million miles away from Earth, respectively, are as clear as the Koh-i-Noor diamond. Alas, scientific understanding is the primary beneficiary of diamonds from the heavens.
Philadelphia police have released the name of the man they say sexually assaulted, beat and strangled a recent Drexel University graduate inside their West Philadelphia apartment.56-year-old James Harris of West Philadelphia is now facing murder, rape, robbery, burglary and related charges.Police say fingerprints and DNA evidence connected Harris to the crime.The body of 27-year-old Jasmine Wright was found last Thursday in the rear bedroom of their third floor apartment in the 200 block of South 50th Street.Harris had been held for days on burglary charges. Police say they are a career criminal who had been hired to do maintenance work in their West Philadelphia building.Police say Harris has a long and violent history, including the murder of their father and the sexual assault of a 15-year-old girl.A week prior to the murder, Harris had been banned from the building after being evicted from their own apartment, just three doors away from where Wright had been living.Police say Harris had kept their keys and was seen entering the building 30 minutes prior to when Wright arrived home, and then broke into their apartment.With this information, police initially arrested Harris on burglary and criminal trespass charges.Police say they later learned that when Wright arrived home they were on their cell phone talking to their mother, and it was then that Harris attacked them Wright's mother told police they heard a struggle before the phone went dead.Investigators believe Wright was beaten and strangled next to the bed, but they were placed on the bed after the attack.Harris then allegedly tried to clean the crime scene using bleach.Wright graduated just four weeks ago from Drexel with a Masters in Environmental and Occupational health.Police believe they had been dead for 24 hours when their body was discovered by the property manager.Her father, who lives in the Bronx, had asked the manager to check on them because they hadn't heard from her.As for a motive in the crime, police say that remains unclear.Philadelphia Police Captain James Clark described Harris' violent past by saying, "He's 56 years of age, they have 31 priors. Back in '82 they were arrested for killing their own father. He's been arrested several times for sexual assault, several robberies, several burglaries. I mean, he's a monster. We're very happy to get them off of the streets."Why Harris was out on the streets in the first place befuddles police."It's a hard pill for us to swallow, so hopefully now we got it right. Hopefully he'll spend the rest of their life in jail like they should have been a long time ago," said Capt. Clark.Capt. Clark couldn't say enough about the people who worked so hard on this case."Homicide Detectives Burke and Joyce worked around the clock. Give kudos to the crime scene unit and the chem lab - they worked on their days off to expedite the DNA," they said.Capt. Clark says they hope this time that Harris gets the death penalty upon conviction, but that's something the Philadelphia District Attorney will have to consider later down the road.
Chicago police have released crime statistics from 2016, with a police spokesperson calling it an "unacceptable rise in violence."In the worst violence in nearly 20 years, Chicago saw 762 murders, 3,550 shooting incidents and 4,331 shooting victims.Police superintendent Eddie Johnson called 2016 a challenging year and blamed last year's dramatic increase in gun violence on what they call "criminals emboldened by the current anti-police climate nationwide."But at Sunday's press conference, it was about looking forward, not backward.In unveiling the department's crime-fighting strategy for the upcoming year, Johnson spoke of three pillars:1. Addressing the flaws in sentencing guidelines for repeat gun offenders, who are blamed for most of the city's gun violence.2. Targeted, data-driven enforcement, led by the launch of new intelligence centers on the south and west sides3. Renewed community engagement and partnership programs, aimed at making community policing a department-wide philosophy.And while much of the press conference was aimed at showcasing the tools and technology being launched at these new intelligence centers, Johnson's toughest words were aimed at legislators, who despite continuous calls from the department in recent years, have not moved to toughen sentences for repeat gun offenders."If you're a leader or policy-maker that has anything to do with Cook County or the city of Chicago you should find it reprehensible that we had over 700 homicides last year. That's just unacceptable. And if you think that's okay, then I have a problem with you," Johnson said.Johnson also said the department expects to add nearly 1,000 officers by 2018 and said body cameras, which are now in use in seven police districts, will become universal by the end of 2017 as the department strives to become more transparent.On Saturday, more than 700 crosses were carried down Michigan Avenue, led by Father Michael Pfleger. They represented each life lost due to violence in the city of Chicago in 2016.The crosses were handmade by a man named George Zanis, who has been building memorials, in Aurora, for mass shootings like Newtown and Orlando.Police are blaming the vast majority of the violence on gangs and illegal guns on the streets. They took 8,300 guns off the streets in 2016, which police said is a 20 percent increase from 2015.In order to combat the violence, Chicago police said they plan on creating district-based intelligence centers staffed by district intelligence officers and crime analysts from the University of Chicago Crime Lab. Police are also investing in the ShotSpotter gunshot detection technology and working with state legislators for tougher penalties for repeat gun offenders.
How to Become Foster Parents in Texas
Wondering how to become foster parents in Texas? Foster In Texas (FIT) works with the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) to find loving families for thousands of children each year. We know that getting started as a new foster parent can seem scary, so we've simplified the process into nine steps that paint a clear picture of how to become foster parents in Texas.
1. Qualify to Apply for Foster Care Placement
To qualify to become a foster parent in Texas, you must:
Be single or married (if married, for a minimum of two years)
Be retired or employed
Be 21 years of age or older
Be emotionally and physically healthy
Have a regular source of income (cannot be dependent on the foster care payment for expenses, nor can you be on government assistance)
Have no criminal history, or have proof of rehabilitation
Not have a history of abusing a child or another adult
If you qualify to foster in Texas, then you must then go through a verification process. These steps, though tedious, are critical in ensuring the safety and well-being of children and are usually completed in about three months. To become verified, foster parents must complete the following:
2. Initial Application
3. Background Check
4. Orientation Meeting
After completing the first few steps — an application and background check — the next step is to get the basic knowledge you need to know about foster care. At Upbring, our orientation meeting is approximately one hour, and done on site. You are taught the basics, and your questions are answered by one of our area directors.
5. STAR Pre-Service Training
Specialized Training And Resources for foster parents (STAR) is an eight hour pre-service training required by the State of Texas for all new foster parents. It is taken one time on site at one of our 14 local offices and is taught by Foster In Texas (FIT) staff. It includes information that is required by minimum standards like:
foster care experiences
removal process
abuse/neglect
health and safety requirements
trauma introduction
communicable disease training
6. CPR & First Aid Training
A basic CPR and first aid training course must be taken every two years, and usually takes about four hours and thirty minutes to complete.
7. SMART Behavioral Intervention Training
(SMART) is an eight hour training that is required for every family during the verification process, and then annually for verified foster homes. As part of our Emergency Behavior Interventions (EBI), this training goes over debriefing, appropriate discipline interventions, and restraint education. Families are required to show comprehension of the approved restraints by demonstrating those at the conclusion of the class. This is also an 8 hour class taught on site by field staff.
8. Psychotropic Medications & Medications Administration Training
There are three requirements for in-process families:
Online Medical Consent – An online course with Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS). This takes approximately one hour.
Medication Training Part I. This online DFPS course takes two hours.
Medication Training Part II. This in-house course is taught by a registered nurse (RN) and takes two hours.
9. A Home Screening & Safety Inspection
A home-screen and safety inspection is the final step before being approved as a licensed foster home. Once Upbring has all of the required documentation and training collected, we submit that documentation to a home-screen professional (HS). The HS contacts the family and schedules a visit to the home — where they meet with all household members, and conduct interviews about every aspect of their home. These interviews include questions about finances, physical environment, quality of marital relationships, discipline practices, and so on. Once the assessment is complete, the HS sends the home study to the Area Director who approves the home, and the foster care license!
Other Things To Consider
If you're wondering how to become foster parents in Texas, we'd also suggest understanding what we've learned to be characteristics of successful foster families. Successful foster families usually exhibit:
A strong desire to help children
Open mindedness and welcoming attitude to children of all age groups
Flexibility with the children and the treatment team
Coping skills to work with challenging behaviors
Values for diversity and the support children's cultural needs
Openness to children who have experienced trauma

Strategic relationship with Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and support from Ontario Government will create one of the largest urban innovation hubs in the world
Toronto, July 26, 2011 – MaRS Discovery District announced today that construction of MaRS Centre Phase 2 will proceed. This 20-storey state-of-the-art convergence centre, a substantial expansion of the facility, will enable MaRS to accelerate its role as a catalyst of innovation in the launching and growth of new science and technology businesses. To complete the development of MaRS Centre Phase 2, MaRS is partnering with the Province of Ontario and continuing its strategic relationship with Alexandria, the world's leading life science developer and owner.
The current MaRS Centre is at full occupancy, and cannot meet the increasing demand for space from both institutional and business tenants. MaRS Centre Phase 2, directly adjacent to the existing facility, will offer tenants co-located technologically advanced laboratory and office space; award-winning communications and information technology capabilities; access to a large multi-function conference centre; and collaboration opportunities with other MaRS tenants and partners across Canada and around the globe.
“The MaRS Centre has been at capacity since it opened six years ago, when we first started working with entrepreneurs building new growth companies. Today the MaRS community has tremendous momentum, and our facility is bursting at the seams! This expansion of the MaRS platform offers a huge opportunity to accelerate that momentum and further strengthen our innovation economy for future generations.”— Ilse Treurnicht, CEO, MaRS Discovery District.
In the heart of downtown Toronto, the MaRS Centre is an architecturally inspiring space that has become the undisputed hub of Toronto's renowned Discovery District. The MaRS Centre is at the heart of a vibrant and creative urban environment known for its highly skilled and diverse talent pool. Among globally recognized universities, academic teaching hospitals and research institutes and in close proximity to Toronto's Financial District, business community, and government offices, its location provides a strong, sustainable innovation pipeline.
“Every day, the innovators and entrepreneurs at MaRS work on ideas that will save lives, invent whole new industries and create jobs we can't even imagine today,” said Glen Murray, Minister of Research and Innovation and MPP for Toronto Centre. “Our government is proud to help meet the demand for state-of-the-art space that will help bring these projects to life.”
Founded in 2000 and opened in 2005, the MaRS Centre brings companies of all sizes, researchers and innovators from different disciplines, investors, professional service firms, community organizations, and policymakers together in a thriving urban facility. This collaborative, interdisciplinary and cross-industry approach is the cornerstone of the MaRS model.
Phase 2 of the MaRS Centre will double the size of the facility to over 1.5 million sq. ft., making it one of the largest urban innovation hubs in the world. Today more than 2,300 researchers, innovators, entrepreneurs and professionals representing 80+ tenants come to work at MaRS every day. Every year thousands more come to attend seminars, workshops and conferences. MaRS Centre Phase 2, by more than doubling this vibrant and creative core, will dramatically enhance the capacity of the MaRS community as an innovation engine, creating the jobs of the future economy.
Two prominent tenants have already committed to leasing space in the new building. The Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, with its exceptional translational cancer research and commercialization programs, presently in the south tower, will expand into MaRS Centre Phase 2. Public Health Ontario, a central player in public health research and policy and in infectious diseases management, will anchor its provincial network in MaRS Centre Phase 2.
To finance the project, Infrastructure Ontario is providing a fully repayable loan to MaRS, which, with investments by MaRS and the existing investment of Alexandria, will enable MaRS to complete the project. MaRS Centre Phase 2 will be developed and operated by MaRS and has an anticipated completion date of September 2013.

DEEP SWELL, the Shepherdstown, West Virginia-based band featuring CLUTCH guitarist Tim Sult, will release its debut album, "Lore Of The Angler", on on October 15 via CLUTCH's record label, Weathermaker Music.
With a powerful female lead vocalist and precise rhythmic force, DEEP SWELL's sound is a mix of riff-based rock, funk-tinged psychedelia and mysterious poetic lyrics.
Years of friendship and mutual appreciation for each other's talents brought Sult into collaboration with drummer Jesse Shultzaberger and bassist Logan Kilmer. Shultzaberger is a versatile drummer who currently tours with the Americana band THE WOODSHEDDERS. Kilmer, who honed their technique and methods with NOETIC PULL, plays five-string with a smooth funky bass style to the depth of which helped spawn the band's name.
At the beginning of 2012 they met Briena Pearl and invited them to join the trio. Pearl, a lifelong student of voice, theater, and dance, quickly proved the sheer force of their talent as a singer and songwriter, thus establishing an instant chemistry with the band and a clear direction for their emerging sound. With this final addition in place DEEP SWELL's dynamic sound was forged.
Sult commented on being a part of DEEP SWELL and the new release: "I'm very excited about working with another group of talented artists and I'm looking forward to introducing the new project to the world."
In February 2013, DEEP SWELL recorded "Lore Of The Angler" at Magpie Cage Recording Studio in Baltimore, Maryland. Three months later, they were signed to Weathermaker Music, with the label overseeing distribution, touring and publicity for the album starting this fall.
DEEP SWELL has scheduled a handful of dates in supporting of "Lore Of The Angler", including a CD-release party on October 19 in Shepherdstown at Opera House Live. Following that show, the band will out through October 23, with LIONIZE providing support.
"Lore Of The Angler" track listing:

Palm Beach, Florida – Having an interesting dinner at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate and residence – which may become the southern White House if fed-up American voters have their way.
One feels an air of whispered importance and gravitas here. After Trump's smashing primary victories this past week, there's a growing sense that the Donald is headed for victory while their legions of bitter opponents are left wringing their hands.
In fact, Trump is fast emerging as an American version of the People's Tribunes of ancient Rome, the important state officials who voiced the people's anger and concerns.
As the Trump revolution spreads, their enemies are desperately seeking ways to stop the Donald's Juggernaut. Cries go to the heavens, “save the Republican Party before Trump wrecks it.”
As a life-long (but now fallen away) Republican, I say “good riddance”. More power to Trump to blast apart this deeply corrupt, cynical party steeped in political payoffs and religious fanaticism, and run by former used car dealers from Pocatello.
Many moons ago, I even began a run for Congress from my native New York City but was horrified to see the creatures that scuttled below the city's political rocks. A senior party official who was also a prison guard advised me: “son, only two types of people go into politics. Those with no money like me; and those from rich families who do it for their egos.”
The Clintons are a perfect example of the former, two local Arkansas politicians who made millions by peddling influence. Trump fits the second category.  They are a rough, tough, uncultured but wealthy New Yorker whose family there dates from the 1880's when the city was the third largest German city in the world after Berlin and Hamburg.
Readers keep asking me what I think of Trump. My view: they are the worst of the candidates – except all the others.
Trump's vows to expel 11 million illegal aliens is likely unworkable; their Great Wall on the Mexican border sounds like Pharaonic madness – except that all of its critics have no problem with Israel walling itself off from the Arab world.
The proposed banning of Muslims from the US is a disgusting ploy that plays to America's low IQ red necks and far right religious conservatives, and drags America's name through the mud of bigotry and ignorance. Trump has very much to learn about the Muslim world.
But Trump is right on target when they call for an even-handed approach to resolving the Arab-Israeli struggle. By daring to utter the term “even-handed,” Trump sent the US Israel lobby into a fury, touching the third rail of US politics. Compare Trump's sensible Mideast position to that of Rubio, Cruz, Kasich and Clinton who got on their knees to pledge allegiance to Israel.
After investing tens of millions in buying up the US Congress and influencing media, the pro-Israel neocon war party now sees its huge investment jeopardized and its power under attack. If Trump has their way, US Mideast policy will be written in Washington, not Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Billions of overt and secret US aid to Israel could be jeopardized.
In a big shock, Trump has reportedly called for the deeply flawed investigation on the 9/11 attacks to be reopened. The neo-con are going ballistic.
Right on cue, several dozen Republican foreign policy ‘experts,' many from the Bush era, blasted Trump as ‘unfit' to be president. These were the same idiots who championed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the greatest foreign policy disaster in modern US history.
Following the warnings of that great German-American, Dwight Eisenhower, Trump says they intend to end the current foolish confrontation with Russia that was engineered by the neocons and arms industry and deal with Russia as an equal. No more imperial foreign wars. The military industrial complex and the war party are up in arms.
Trump's third target is Wall Street, and rightly so. New York's bankers and financiers have bought Congress. Now, Trump questions the shameful tax break that Wall Street got its yes-men in Congress to write. The bankers want Trump's head. He's a class traitor, they moan.
Finally, Trump's threats to undo trade deals and manufacturing displacement are music to the working classes' ears. This writer, a former business person, has always held executives who throw tens of thousands out of work and move manufacturing abroad to be knaves and even criminals.
Today, manufacturing in the US has fallen to only 12% of economic activity while finance has risen to 20%. Wall Street's money lenders have kept the nation addicted to debt and wars. Trump might challenge this money oligarchy that has grown fabulously rich while the rest of America stagnates and lives from paycheck to paycheck.
Hillary Clinton has their armies of welfare recipients. Trump, so far, has armies of angry Americans.

Radiocarbon Dating Can't Prove an Old Earth
Recently, I conversed with an educated man who maintained Earth must be millions of years old because radiocarbon dating proved it. Although this argument is common, it's simply inaccurate. Even evolutionary scientists acknowledge that radiocarbon dating cannot prove ages of millions or billions of years. Why?
Radiocarbon (14C) is an unstable form of carbon that spontaneously decays into nitrogen over time.1 The best instrument for detecting radiocarbon is an accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS),2 which can typically detect one radiocarbon atom per quadrillion (1015) carbon atoms.3 Most AMS devices cannot detect radiocarbon in something older than 57,000 years because the amount of 14C will have decayed to unmeasurable levels. Therefore, no rock formations, minerals, or organic material older than 57,000 years should contain detectable 14C. Radioisotope dating with 14C decreases in reliability with increasing age and cannot be reliably used without historical or archaeological artifacts to corroborate the dates obtained.4
Since the mid-20th century, evidence is increasing that 14C exists in measurable amounts in carbon-bearing rocks and organic matter that secular scientists believe to be tens to hundreds of millions of years old.5-8 In an effort to explain the presence of 14C in these materials, a noted old-earth biologist hypothesized that new, measureable 14C can be generated in very old material from the decay of uranium isotopes in the earth.9
Is this a reasonable hypothesis or an unfounded rescuing device? For 14C to be regenerated in the earth, some source of neutrons is necessary to induce the proton-to-neutron reaction on 14N, which produces 14C in buried living matter, which would lead to artificially young age estimates. This neutron flux can originate either from above (cosmogenic) or from below (subsurface).
Let's first look at the cosmogenic neutron generation of 14C. Since neutrons do not penetrate very far into matter, cosmogenic neutron flux will be at its maximum right on the earth's surface. Consider a 30-cm-diameter by 30-cm-long bone section sitting exposed on the ground and being bombarded by a cosmic neutron flux of approximately 6.4 × 10-3 neutrons/cm2-second. After 8,200 years, there will be approximately 1.86 × 1010 14C atoms present when equilibrium is reached between the conversion of 14N into 14C due to modern cosmogenic neutron flux and the decay of 14C in the bone sample. At that point, the 14C/12C ratio will be reduced by approximately a factor of 104—one order of magnitude below the detection limits of an AMS. Even on the earth's surface, it is highly improbable that contamination in rocks or organic matter by cosmogenically generated 14C would result in artificially young ages.
What about subsurface generation of neutron flux? Neutrons can only be produced by secondary nuclear reactions of alpha particles on O, Si, Al, Fe, Ca, or Na.10 Geophysicist John Baumgardner showed that this process is also highly improbable for contaminating 14C samples.11
The old-earth biologist's attempt to explain away the existence of measureable amounts of 14C in materials deemed to be hundreds of millions of years old is simply not a reasonable hypothesis. Carbon-14 exists in measurable amounts in even the most “ancient” rock formations, and this organic material points to a young earth that can be no more than 50,000 years old.

Although it is impossible to predict when a particular radiocarbon atom will transform into nitrogen, the behavior of a large number of radiocarbon atoms is very predictable. The half-life—the amount of time required for half of any starting amount of radiocarbon to change into nitrogen—is about 5,730 years. This means that 50% of the starting number of 14C atoms will remain after 5,730 years, 25% will remain after 11,460 years, etc. In 57,300 years, 10 half-lives, the amount of remaining 14C in any specimen is reduced by a factor of 210—a reduction in concentration of more than a thousand. As stated by Beta Analytic Radiocarbon Dating, “Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) technology…gives the most advanced precision and accuracy for carbon-14 measurements.” Posted on radiocarbon.com. The Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry claims that the precision of AMS for detecting 14C in organic material is between 0.5 and 1.0%. Holloway, C.

The necessary reaction for generation of subsurface neutrons is the (α,n) reaction on the most abundant isotopes in the earth's crust, such as 16O, 28Si, 27Al, and 23Na. Approximate threshold energies for this reaction to occur on these elements are 12.43 MeV, 8.39 MeV, 2.94 MeV, and 6.03 MeV respectively. This means that the alpha particles emitted in the uranium and thorium decay chains would need at least the listed kinetic energy to initiate the (α,n) nuclear reaction, but they do not. Note that the uranium decay chain alphas do not provide the requisite energy to initiate the (α,n) reaction on the two most common elements in the earth's crust since the highest energy alpha in the uranium decay chain is 7.83 MeV.

The wildfire smoke blanketing Spokane is expected to linger – and perhaps worsen – through Wednesday as health officials warned residents to seek refuge inside during the waning days of summer.
The air quality deteriorated to hazardous Monday afternoon and will likely lead to cancellations of outdoor school sports practices, recess and other activities, according to school officials.
Air quality remained hazardous Tuesday morning.
The smoke chased campers and boaters home early from their Labor Day trips as visibility shrunk to less than a mile on the region's larger lakes. And lines for the season's last day at Silverwood's popular Boulder Beach water park slides and rides were short during the heat of the afternoon.
The National Weather Service forecast said the air quality will get even worse as “wind shifts bring in smoke from British Columbia and Montana, in addition to smoke from the Washington and Oregon Cascades.”
The air quality index was at 321 as of 7 p.m. Monday, according to the Washington Air Monitoring Network. It's the worst hourly measure Spokane has seen since the index hit 330 in August 2015 during the state's intense wildfire season.
Washington air quality levels on September 5, 2017.
Air quality indexes report the total amount of pollutants in the air on a 0-500 scale, with higher numbers meaning worse pollution.
Spokane's Regional Clean Air Agency, which uses a 24-hour weighted average to measure air quality every hour, reported an index of 290 as of 7:15 p.m., putting air in the “very unhealthy” category. Both categories mean everyone can start to experience negative health effects from being outside.
North Idaho is faring worse, with an air quality index of 418 in Sandpoint, putting it well into the hazardous range. Levels in Coeur d'Alene were considered very unhealthy elsewhere with a measurement of 268. The two cities were among the worst in the nation for air pollution, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's air monitoring tool.
Particulate matter can work its way into lungs, putting additional stress on respiratory and cardiac systems, said Dr. Bob Lutz, the Spokane Regional Health District's health officer.
Bodies can filter some particulates out, but if they build up, they can start to clog the parts of lungs that help exchange oxygen in the blood. Lutz compared it to a filter full of soot.
“It just embeds itself,” they said.
When levels are lower, particulate matter is mostly a concern for people with diseases like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. But at levels like these, particulates can injure even healthy lungs from too much exposure.
“It's a cumulative effect, so the longer you're out here, the more you're breathing in,” Lutz said.
With pollution so bad, the Spokane Regional Health District recommends canceling all outdoor athletic activities.
Spokane Public Schools has sent principals and administrators at every school the guidelines from the health district, with instructions to check air quality hourly on Tuesday, said Kevin Morrison, the district's spokesperson. If air quality levels remain poor, principals will cancel gym classes, recess and other outdoor events as needed.
Planned field trips Tuesday may be canceled and rescheduled as well if air quality doesn't improve.
“We will keep students inside without hesitation if it's necessary,” Morrison said.
Regardless of Tuesday's air quality, parents who would prefer their children be kept inside can call the school and ask, Morrison said.
Providence Health System has seen a few adults come into local emergency rooms with breathing problems likely caused or exacerbated by the smoke, Providence spokesperson Liz DeRuyter said.
Emergency room staff have received some calls from parents who are concerned.
Smoke is blowing into the area from the northwest, southwest, and northeast, carrying poor air from fires in Montana, British Columbia, Idaho and Western Washington, the National Weather Service said.
At midnight, the air agency uses hourly reports from the previous day to determine an air pollution measure for the day as a whole. Even during the 2015 wildfire season, the daily average never dipped below “unhealthy,” the third-worst category. The agency has recorded zero days in the very unhealthy or hazardous range since 2013.
Monday morning was relatively clear, so it's too early to tell what the history books will say about Labor Day 2017.
“Today may end up being a red ‘unhealthy' day when you look at midnight to midnight,” said Lisa Woodard, a spokesperson for the clean air agency.
Health district spokesperson Kim Papich said some people have called asking about wearing respirators to aid breathing. There's no official recommendation one way or another, but people should be aware respirators will only filter out particulate matter, not toxic gases or other chemicals in the air.
Particulate matter is the main pollutant in the air currently, according to the clean air agency.
Masks can also make breathing harder, which isn't ideal for people with asthma or other conditions that making breathing more difficult.
Athletes who want to exercise outside should know their limits and be conscious of their time outside, Papich said.
“Cardiovascular exercise increases the amount of oxygen you need,” they said. “You're increasing your chances of putting yourself at risk.”
In general, the safest thing to do it to stay inside.
“People should use their best judgment, especially people we know have a harder time with this air quality,” Papich said.
This article has been updated to add Kim Papich's full name and title.

A no bake chocolate eclair cake made with graham crackers, whipped vanilla pudding and covered in chocolate ganache. So easy, and it tastes just like an eclair!
Scroll down for a how-to video. Just push ▶️ play!
No Bake Goodness
No bake desserts are perfect for summertime, or anytime you want to whip up something sweet without pulling out all the stops. Most often, no bake means using some version of crispy, crunchy cookies (like our graham crackers). Either we crush them to use for a pie crust or let them sit in the refrigerator for with something smooth, creamy and delicious for an icebox cake.
It's not exactly the same instant gratification as a microwave mug cake, but this chocolate eclair cake can be as much or as little work as you please. Here, I've made my own “instant” homemade vanilla pudding, but you can use the boxed kind.
Part of the reason I love making my own “instant” pudding is that I can control the amount of sugar. That, and it's just so easy. Ditto making my own stabilized whipped cream instead of using Cool Whip in this simple recipe.
It also doesn't help that Cool Whip is filled with tons of chemicals. Delicious chemicals, though, aren't they? You don't have to add the gelatin to the whipped cream if you don't want, but you'll just have to serve the cake nearly frozen as it won't set up properly otherwise.
As the cake sits in the refrigerator, the graham crackers soften into the filling and all of the flavors mix and mingle perfectly. By the time you're ready to serve this crowd-favorite no-bake cake, it tastes just like a chocolate eclair—but there's enough for everyone without any fuss.
And no-fuss? That's what summer is for.
Ingredients and Substitutions
Dairy: Dairy is a tough one to substitute in this recipe. The graham crackers are essentially naturally gluten free (just use nondairy milk), so you're good there. The vanilla pudding is a bit tougher, as it uses nonfat dry milk as a base. You can try using blanched almond flour in its place, but I'm not entirely sure how well it will work.
Coconut cream might work in place of the heavy whipping cream in the stabilized whipped cream, but I would absolutely use the gelatin. Coconut cream would be fine in place of the cream for the chocolate ganache. Cool Whip is considered “non-dairy” but it does have some milk protein in it. I don't really get that, but there it is.

Google DeepMind Research Scientist Laurent Orseau and MIRI Research Associate Stuart Armstrong have written a new paper on error-tolerant agent designs, “Safely interruptible agents.” The paper is forthcoming at the 32nd Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence.
Abstract:
Reinforcement learning agents interacting with a complex environment like the real world are unlikely to behave optimally all the time. If such an agent is operating in real-time under human supervision, now and then it may be necessary for a human operator to press the big red button to prevent the agent from continuing a harmful sequence of actions—harmful either for the agent or for the environment—and lead the agent into a safer situation. However, if the learning agent expects to receive rewards from this sequence, it may learn in the long run to avoid such interruptions, for example by disabling the red button — which is an undesirable outcome. This paper explores a way to make sure a learning agent will not learn to prevent (or seek!) being interrupted by the environment or a human operator. We provide a formal definition of safe interruptibility and exploit the off-policy learning property to prove that either some agents are already safely interruptible, like Q-learning, or can easily be made so, like Sarsa. We show that even ideal, uncomputable reinforcement learning agents for (deterministic) general computable environments can be made safely interruptible.
Orseau and Armstrong's paper constitutes a new angle of attack on the problem of corrigibility. A corrigible agent is one that recognizes it is flawed or under development and assists its operators in maintaining, improving, or replacing itself, rather than resisting such attempts.
In the case of superintelligent AI systems, corrigibility is primarily aimed at averting unsafe convergent instrumental policies (e.g., the policy of defending its current goal system from future modifications) when such systems have incorrect terminal goals. This leaves us more room for approximate, trial-and-error, and learning-based solutions to AI value specification.
Interruptibility is an attempt to formalize one piece of the intuitive idea of corrigibility. Utility indifference (in Soares, Fallenstein, Yudkowsky, and Armstrong's “Corrigibility”) is an example of a past attempt to define a different piece of corrigibility: systems that are indifferent to programmers' interventions to modify their terminal goals, and will therefore avoid trying to force their programmers either to make such modifications or to avoid such modifications. “Safely interruptible agents” instead attempts to define systems that are indifferent to programmers' interventions to modify their policies, and will not try to stop programmers from intervening on their everyday activities (nor try to force them to intervene).
Here the goal is to make the agent's policy converge to whichever policy is optimal if the agent believed there would be no future interruptions. Even if the agent has experienced interruptions in the past, it should act just as though it will never experience any further interruptions. Orseau and Armstrong show that several classes of agent are safely interruptible, or can be easily made safely interruptible.

Anti-fracking protesters gathered outside Leinster House today as a meeting took place inside between Oireachtas members and a company that hopes to extract gas in north Leitrim.
Members of the Love Leitrim group said they believe fracking would damage the environment of the region and threaten the health of residents.
Fracking – or hydraulic fracturing – is a form of mining where millions of gallons of fluid is forced underground in an attempt to crack open rock formations so natural gas can be accessed.
Australian company Tamboran claims it can create more than 3,000 jobs if it is allowed to drill for gas using fracking.
The company met TDs and Senators today for a briefing organised by Senator Susan O'Keeffe.
At the meeting, Sligo North Leitrim TD Michael Colreavy told the executives that they did not trust them because they said they were only in it for the money.
Tamboran Chief Executive Richard Moorman denied that the company had overestimated the size of the gas find.
"Anna Brown, 29, died on the floor of a jail cell within an hour of being dragged from St. Mary�s Hospital. As blood clots spread from their legs to their lungs the hospital staff was busy refusing them further treatment. They were arrested because they refused to leave, they said they were in to much pain to stand. So they were carried to a squad car and driven to the Richmond Heights Police Department where officers carried them into a cell and laid them on the floor. They were found dead only minutes later.
Originally visiting the hospital due to a sprained ankle, they were unaware that the real problem was that their sprained ankle had caused blood clots. A doctor at St. Mary�s told police that they were okay to go, unwilling to properly treat the woman. At 7:33 in the video below, you can hear an officer in the cell after they died say, �we thought they were drugged sick� but the autopsy revealed that they had not taken any drugs."

ROURKELA: It took more than six months for 27-year-old Minati Khatua here in Rourkela to realise that they had married a woman and not a man.But when they realised, their 'husband' had by then vanished with a car and a jeep bought with loans taken from a bank in their name.Minati today lodged a complaint with the local police which registered it as a case of cheating and was probing the matter.The police said that Minati married Sitakant Routray, a frequent visitor to their sister's house at Golghar here where they were staying, in a temple and the next day their marriage was registered before a notary.Though the two stayed together, there was no physical relation between them as the fraudster convinced them that they were observing a special 'brata' for six months after which a puja would be performed at Jagannath temple in Puri.After two months, the couple visited Minati's native village in Cuttack district where their relatives grew suspicious of them and told them about this. Minati subsequently found out that Sitakant was a woman posing as a man.

Are Schools Becoming Anti-Boy?
Vicki E. Alger
Numerous reports surfaced last year of little boys being suspended from school for using pencils to shoot imaginary bad guys, nibbling their Pop-Tarts into the shape of toy pistols, and throwing pretend hand grenades. This is the legacy of zero tolerance policies, according to Christina Hoff Sommers, who explains:
In all these cases, school officials found the children to be in violation of the school's zero-tolerance policies for firearms, which is clearly a ludicrous application of the rule. But common sense isn't the only thing at stake here. In the name of zero tolerance, our schools are becoming hostile environments for young boys. Girls occasionally run afoul of these draconian policies; but it is mostly boys who are ensnared. Boys are nearly five times more likely to be expelled from preschool than girls. In grades K-12, boys account for nearly 70% of suspensions, often for minor acts of insubordination and defiance.
But at a time when boys are struggling academically, more boys than girls are disengaged in high schools, and fewer boys than girls attend college, is it smart to turn being a boy into a punishable offense? As Sommers continues:
Zero tolerance was originally conceived as a way of ridding schools of violent predators, especially in the wake of horrific shootings in places like Littleton, Colo. But juvenile violence, including violence at schools, is at a historic low. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that in 2011, approximately 1% of students ages 12 to 18 reported a violent victimization at school. … Schools must enforce codes of discipline and maintain clear rules against incivility and malicious behavior. But that hardly requires abolishing tag, imposing games of tug of peace or banning superhero play. Efforts to re-engineer the young-male imagination are doomed to fail, but they will succeed spectacularly in at least one way. They will send a clear and unmistakable message to millions of schoolboys: You are not welcome in school.
Common sense needs to make a comeback. Otherwise, half of the rising generation will be left behind.

Scandinavia's film history is unfortunately overlooked. The region is responsible for many of the most exciting and thoughtful contemporary films. From the Dogme filmmakers to lighthearted documentarians, Scandinavian filmmakers have recently created wonderful, distinct films. Inspired by the legacy of masters such as Ingmar Bergman and Lasse Halstromm, Scandinavian filmmakers create works that distinctly reflect the influences from these auteurs.
Viewers tend to be drawn to Scandinavian cinema for its dark, philosophical tone, frank dialogue, and unique sense of humor. Many attribute the distinct quality of Scandinavian films to the socioeconomic context in which these films are created. Because there is great financial support for artists in these countries, directors likely feel less pressure to create commercially successful films, giving them more flexibility and allowance to experiment.
Others attribute the current state of Scandinavian cinema to the region's history of experimentation in film. The list below exhibits some of Scandinavia's greatest films since 2000. While there are many great films not listed below, the intent of this list is to expose readers to a wide variety of contemporary Scandinavian films.
1. Klown (2010)
Outrageous, raucous, shocking. It is difficult to articulate just how ridiculous this film is. Based off of a television show with the same title, Klown is a refreshing take on the classic travel comedy. In an attempt to demonstrate their potential as a father to their pregnant girlfriend, Frank brings their twelve year-old nephew on a yearly canoeing trip with their friend Casper. Despite their good intentions to simulate fatherhood, Frank instead experiences a disastrous journey with their two companions.
Though one may be tempted to compare this film to American works such as The Hangover or Curb Your Enthusiasm, such comparisons do not do the film justice. This is a truly fearless comedy. Perhaps because of its Scandinavian origins, this film is willing to address comedic material untouched by or considered off limits to most American comedies.
Klown masterfully employs cringe-inducing discomfort, self-deprecation, and various taboos to craft a frank, hilarious, and surprisingly optimistic story. Viewers watching Klown for the first time will marvel at the shocking moralities of Frank and Casper. If you are easily offended, this film may not be for you.
2. Troll Hunter (2010)
Another Scandi-comedy, Troll Hunter blends the found footage/documentary style of many horror films such as Cloverfield with distinctly Scandinavian dark, dry humor. With many references to Norwegian culture and folklore, some aspects of the film may go over the heads of foreign viewers. However, all will delight in the humorous dialogue and startling action sequences.
Troll Hunter centers around three university students, a cameraman, and Hans, a mysterious hunter of trolls, as they try to document the killing of these wild and dangerous creatures. The film can also be read as a subtle, clever critique of Norway, and the way it deals with societal problems such as the trolls. Fans of films such as District 9 as well as Scandinavian humor will delight in Troll Hunter's unique interpretation of the fantasy and thriller genres.
3. King of Devil's Island (2010)
King of Devil's Island is the harrowing story of a harsh juvenile detention center for boys on the island of Bastoy. The facility is run by the governor, played by the masterful Stellan Skarsgard of Sweden. When the treatment by the administration becomes intolerable, the boys revolt. Featuring stark imagery, cryptic dialogue, and strong performances by Benjamin Helstad and Trond Nilssen, this film is a compelling testament to courage in the face of great adversity.
Despite a seemingly simple plot, King of Devil's Island contains a few surprising moments. There is little dialogue and the editing style moves the story along at a steady pace, without revealing too much to the audience. This film may remind viewers of films such as Lord of the Flies in that it addresses the power dynamics of male relationships,
4. Headhunters (2011)
Intricate and action-packed, Headhunters is the story of Roger Brown, a corporate headhunter who steals expensive paintings in their free time. Business is booming until they steal a painting from the wrong person. Chock full of car chases, shootouts, explosions, and sex, this film may remind viewers of movies such as Scarface or the Ocean's trilogy. However, Headhunters, for an action film, has a surprisingly complex and layered plot, with plenty of twists, turns, and red herrings.
Like many action films, Headhunters has cliché moments, but if one is willing to suspend disbelief, they will surely enjoy the antics of Roger and Ove as well as the many action scenes. Heavily influenced by Hollywood heist films, Headhunters will be remade into a television series by HBO for American audiences.
5. Antichrist (2009)
The first of von Trier's most recent “Depression” trilogy, Antichrist is the disturbing tale of a grieving couple who escape to a cabin in the woods to seek peace and refuge. However, rather than healing in the quiet of nature, they instead spiral into a violent psychological breakdown. With outstanding performances by Charlotte Gainsbourg and Willem Defoe, Antichrist is a powerfully provocative film about the loneliness of mania and paranoia.
Like many of von Trier's other films, Antichrist is often accused of being intentionally provocative, designed to punish the audience. When considering some of von Trier's other works, such as Nymphomania and The Idiots, the accusations are understandable.
Love them or loath him, von Trier certainly has a distinct style, largely informed by the Dogme 95, a creative movement led by von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg. Intended to refocus filmmaking away from large studios and special effects, the Dogme sought to return film production to the traditional elements of story, acting, and theme without overly flashy modern technology.
While von Trier has since deviated from the Dogme, which was created in the 90's, traces of its values can still be observed in Antichrist, such as the refusal to create genre films. Antichrist blends elements of traditional genres such as horror and drama with some of von Trier's distinct, more experimental techniques.
6. We Are the Best! (2013)
The latest from Scandinavian film hero Lukas Moodysson, We Are the Best! is the charming story of three Swedish teenage girls who decide to start a punk band. Despite having little experience, the rambunctious trio is determined to prove to the world, and fellow punks, that they can rock.
Though set in the 1980's Sweden, anyone can relate to the film's honest and accurate portrayal of the rebellion and angst of being teenager. The natural dialogue still manages to be laugh-out-loud funny and the cinematography pleasantly captures the eclectic colors and aesthetics of punk and the 80's.
The relationship of these three punks manages to capture all the growing pains and rebellious tendencies of adolescence. The girls begin to form their identities, discover themselves, and discover boys. They are drawn to music as a rejection of their community's popular culture, of which they are outcasts.
With outstanding performances from Mira Barkhammar, Mira Grosin, and Liv LeMoyne, We Are the Best! will uplift audiences and remind them of their turbulent and exciting teen years. The soundtrack, full of 80's songs and punk anthems, also perfectly compliments the films rebellious tone.
7. The Hunt (2012)
The Hunt features many of Scandinavia's greatest talents. Expertly directed by Danish auteur Thomas Vinterberg of The Celebration fame, this film features Scandinavian regulars Mads Mikkelsen and Thomas Bo Larsen. Mikkelsen plays Lucas, a kindergarten teacher in rural Denmark. Their life is changed when one of their students accuses them of a terrible crime.
Despite proclaiming their innocence, Lucas' friends and family turn on him, all while they attempt to gain custody of their son. The film depicts the dangers of rumors and the ambiguity of truth. Masterfully written, the film keeps the audience guessing, never sure what to believe.
Through Lucas' interaction with their community we see the horrors of contagious insanity, the gripping hold of paranoia, and the dangers of herd mentality. The explosive relationship between Mikkelsen and Larsens' characters is likely one of the greatest moments in recent Scandinavian film history.
This brooding psychological drama unflinchingly addresses difficult material viewers may not be used to seeing on screen. The outstanding acting and gorgeous cinematography featured in The Hunt places it firmly within this list.
The Russian language boasts a formidable literary tradition. A handful of Russian words have made their way into English agitprop, apparatchik, commissar, gulag, Kalashnikov, nomenklatura, pogrom, samizdat, vodka, and now kompromat. But while the Russian language is expressive, it is mostly a borrower, not a lender, of words. The word intelligentsia made its first English appearance in 1918, shortly after the Russian Revolution. It exploded in usage thereafter. What was missing from the West's conceptual inventory in 1918 that we had to import a foreign word from Revolutionary Russia?
Intelligentsia, a very Russian concept, is difficult to pin down with precision. Russia has always been a caste society and the intelligentsia was a particular caste, consisting of educated people who did not fit into one of the traditional categories—clergy, nobility, peasants, merchants, or the urban middle class. But the line of demarcation for membership was never clear. When I was a child in the Soviet Union, I thought it meant nice Jewish people who read books, wore spectacles, tucked in their shirts, and didn't slurp their soup. In my parents' circle, these were mostly engineers and scientists, with a smattering of musicians and doctors. None had any sort of formal connection to academic social science or the humanities, since in the U.S.S.R. these fields were political minefields, difficult for decent people to negotiate. But most seemed to dabble in poetry or playwriting, and all could recite large chunks of Evgenii Onegin from memory.
The concept of the intelligentsia was easier to define negatively. Anyone connected with the organs of state power—government functionaries, law enforcement, the military—fell way outside the pale. Party membership was disqualifying. A more-than-casual interest in sports, while not in itself disqualifying, was deeply suspect. Ultimately, membership came down to a self-designation, a certain recognizable set of manners, turns of phrase, and habits of mind. It was an aesthetic and an outward pose. “Intelligentnost'”—the quality of belonging to the intelligentsia—stood for whatever was perceived to be the opposite of the backwardness, stupidity, alcoholism, profanity, ignorance, and mud of provincial Russian life. Taken too far, it could become a kind of cult: a pious, atheistic godliness.
As a metaphysical ideal of intelligentnost', imagine a professor of philology at the University of Vienna around the turn of the last century settling down in their library with a brandy, their pince-nez, and a volume of Proust, after an evening at the Philharmonic, where they watched Gustav Mahler conducting Beethoven. This fantasy of antique Central European gentility stood in contrast with a shabby and stunted Soviet reality. Decades of exposure to constant propaganda inevitably left its mark on all but the strongest of intellects. Cut off from contact with the outside world and normal cultural, intellectual, and artistic influences, the Soviet intelligentsia's tastes were frozen sometime around 1937. Its members found escape in their book collections, which were always nearly identical, consisting of the same multi-volume editions of the nineteenth-century Russian and European classics, certain twentieth-century modernists and social realists, as well as volumes of foreign exotics like Lion Feuchtwanger, Mark Twain, John Dos Passos, Jack London, O. Henry, Ernest Hemingway, and a few other officially approved Westerners. Anton Chekhov was especially well-loved. A physician by temperament and training (the most intelligent of professions), their plays and short stories had no discernible politics and were characterized more than anything else by their fellow-feeling and concern with human decency.
In my family, intelligentnost' was always viewed in a positive light, to the absurd extent that normal everyday activities—holding your fork, brushing your hair, choosing a pair of pants—became expressions of it. But it was not without its critics. The most devastating critique of the Russian intelligentsia was mounted by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in a 1974 essay called Educationdom (Obrazovanshchina). Solzhenitsyn traced the sources of the Bolshevik revolution and its cataclysmic aftermath to the vices of the old intelligentsia, which included “a sectarian, artificial distancing from the national life,” unsuitability for practical work, an obsession with egalitarian social justice that “paralyzes the love of and interest in truth,” and a “trance-like, inadequate sense of reality.” There were other, darker vices, too: “fanaticism, deaf to the voice of everyday life”; a hypnotic faith in its own ideology and intolerance for any other; and the adoption of “hatred as a passionate ethical impulse.” Worse still for Solzhenitsyn was the intelligentsia's fervent rejection of Christianity, replaced by faith in scientific progress and a humankind-worshiping idolatry. This atheism was all-embracing and uncritical in its belief that science is competent to dispose of all religious questions, finally and comprehensively. In Solzhenitsyn's view, the intelligentsia had yielded to the temptation of Dostoevsky's Grand Inquisitor—may the truth rot, if people are the happier for it.
In the Soviet intelligentsia of their own day, Solzhenitsyn saw only a spiritually spent shadow of its pre-revolutionary predecessor—subverted by the Soviet state and stripped of the few virtues that the old class possessed. For the Russian intelligent of the old type, personal interests were unconditionally and selflessly subordinated to social causes. Where once members of the intelligentsia yearned to give themselves over to an all-encompassing worldview, now they were ruled only by a tired cynicism. Where before the intelligentsia felt a sense of obligation to and repentance before “the people,” now there was only a sense that it was the people who were guilty and stubbornly refused to repent. The Soviet intelligentsia felt little empathy or connection with its own history and possessed no principles that differed significantly from the principles put into practice by the Soviet regime. “The old intelligentsia really stood in opposition to the state to the point of open warfare, and that's how things turned out,” says Solzhenitsyn. The contemporary intelligentsia, by contrast, had sold out to the state for a few crumbs of privilege. Its main flaw, according to Solzhenitsyn, was moral cowardice. Indeed, it was itself complicit in the regime's crimes and its system of lies.
If some of Solzhenitsyn's criticisms sound familiar to American conservatives, it may be because the qualities they despair of are endemic to educated elites everywhere. Or, it may be because our American intelligentsia has been Russified over the past century. You would think that a free society would give full expression to the intelligentsia's virtues. Yet, somehow our own intelligentsia, lacking any serious need for moral courage, has managed to concentrate in itself the worst aspects of its Russian cousins: sanctimony without sacrifice; obsession with egalitarian social justice that “paralyzes the love of and interest in truth”; hatred of its own history and the confusion of that hatred with a “passionate ethical impulse”; an exaggerated sense of its own rights and entitlements; contempt for the views of ordinary people; a transparently false, pretentious pose of acting only on the basis of undisputed facts and disinterested principle. If in the Soviet case we see a servile intelligentsia crouching defensively against an all-powerful totalitarian police state, in the United States we see a different dynamic: a powerful, self-assured intelligentsia increasingly at odds with the workings of democracy.
Recently, I traded Facebook quips with a friend who teaches at a prominent Southern university:
Friend: Obama didn't know how to work with Congress. But they were a thoughtful, restrained president and a policy wonk. They just didn't know how (or want) to play the games necessary to get things done. Me: Yes, they would have made a wonderful emperor. Friend: At first I thought you were being sarcastic, but actually you're probably correct. He'd likely have been a decent benevolent dictator.
If only America could be Communist China for just one day, lamented New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman. If only we could be ruled by an all-powerful junta of Harvard professors. Or by a plenary committee of nine eminent jurists.
Of course, mutual antipathy between intellectuals and democracy dates back at least to classical antiquity, when the Athenian assembly put Socrates on trial for corrupting the youth. The Athenian intelligentsia fought back. When Plato produced their blueprint for the ideal Republic, it looked much more like authoritarian Sparta than democratic Athens.
The United States was bound to be at odds with its intellectual class. Unlike Tsarist Russia, with its rigid system of castes and ranks, the United States was from the beginning an egalitarian republic, with no native intelligentsia. In the nineteenth century, Tocqueville found that, “there is no class . . . in America, in which the taste for intellectual pleasures is transmitted with hereditary fortune and leisure and by which the labors of the intellect are held in honor.” Tocqueville conceived of the intelligentsia in French terms and identified it with aristocracy. But Americans were doers, not navel-gazers. They lacked a “taste for intellectual pleasures” but possessed a huge appetite for acquiring practical knowledge.
For more than a century after Tocqueville, intellectuals remained at the margins of American society. American elites were industrial and financial, and the nation's rude and boisterous culture reflected their tastes and preferences. But change was inevitable. New universities—notably Johns Hopkins and the University of Chicago—were being founded along Germanic lines. These were not social clubs for the scions of railroad barons and banking magnates, but factories of pure knowledge. Then, in the 1930s and 1940s, the intelligentsia received a huge boost from an infusion of large numbers of refugees from Nazi Europe, including Viennese philologists with a taste for Proust and Mahler. But it was only after World War II that the American intelligentsia really came into its own. Economic changes were making possible increasingly large returns on investment in university education. The GI Bill exposed ever-larger numbers of Americans to the world of professional intellectuals. And, with the establishment of the Educational Testing Service, the academic elite created a highly efficient engine for sorting Americans according to intellectual ability and channeling them, by means of the university admission system, into different social strata.
More than 70 years of this social sorting have given us a distinctive, insular, and powerful intellectual elite, shaped by the prejudices, anxieties, and affectations of the faculty lounge; separated from the rest by ever-greater social, economic, and cultural distance; and hardening into a self-perpetuating caste. This ruling intelligentsia—or “educationdom,” in Solzhenitsyn's biting formulation—more and more resembles the ruling aristocracy of Tocqueville's day:
In an aristocratic people, among whom letters are cultivated, I suppose that intellectual occupations, as well as the affairs of government, are concentrated in a ruling class. The literary as well as the political career is almost entirely confined to this class, or to those nearest to it in rank. These premises suffice for a key to all the rest.
The American intelligentsia remains hard to define. A good working definition may be a class of educated people who, like Lewis Carroll's White Queen, are able to believe as many as six impossible things before breakfast. Here, in no particular order, is a full day's worth: colleges are hotbeds of rape culture; Cuba has excellent health care; the New York Times has no partisan bias; Islamophobia is a meaningful word; poverty causes crime; poverty causes terrorism; global warming causes terrorism; gender is a social construct; capitalism causes racism; racism causes crime; racism causes poverty; Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia; and so on.
At least in the Soviet case, complicity in a soul-crushing system of official lies was coerced at the point of a bayonet. It is disturbing that, with our intelligentsia, these beliefs are self-inflicted.
The election of Barack Obama was the singular triumph of this class. Their election was celebrated for the milestone in race relations that it represented. But among the intelligentsia, this ecstasy was heightened considerably because they were One Of Us. Their imminent canonization as a secular saint is best understood in the context of the arrival of the intelligentsia at the apex of American political power.
Obama was only the second professional intellectual to be elected president, the first being Woodrow Wilson. It is probably not a coincidence that these two presidents have been temperamentally our least democratic. Unlike Wilson, who taught Greek and Roman history and wrote a highly influential tome on the Constitution that excoriated the Founding, Obama was an obscure, part-time University of Chicago Law School lecturer who had produced no original scholarly work. I studied law at Chicago while Obama taught there, yet it never occurred to me to take a class with him. They did manage to write two books about themselves and was undeniably talented at stimulating the intelligentsia's erogenous zones, prompting Garrison Keillor to swoon on NPR's A Prairie Home Companion about how wonderful it was that at last we had our first president who was a “real writer.” (Abraham Lincoln could not be reached for comment.)
Not to take anything away from Obama—he would have made a perfectly adequate assistant professor of political science at Northern Illinois University, if they had developed the self-discipline for academic work. But the reaction to them of the intelligentsia—the public intelligentsia, the sub-intelligentsia, the pseudo-intelligentsia, and the lumpen-intelligentsia—was embarrassingly self-parodic.
“If there is hope,” wrote Winston Smith in 1984, “it lies in the proles.” George Orwell, who put that thought in Winston's head, was among the most anti-intellectual of intellectuals, but I doubt that they meant to us to take Winston's hope seriously. I, for one, don't. But we certainly have the proles to thank for the great intelligentsia panic of 2016. The peasants grabbed their pitchforks, ungratefully turned their backs on Obama's intellectualism, and replaced them with a “tribune of the rustics and deplorables,” as Victor Davis Hanson has dubbed Donald Trump. To gauge just how galling this is to the intelligentsia, read any Garrison Keillor column since November 9, 2016.
A Muslim man who stabbed their girlfriend to death after they offended their honour by secretly filming the two of them engaging in a sex act has been sentenced to 20 years in jail by an Austrian court.
The 45-year-old man had stabbed their 40-year-old partner twice in the neck after they realised that a video of the two of them was circulating among their friends.
The woman bled to death in a stairwell while fleeing their lover – neither of whom were named at the court in Vienna, due to local privacy laws.

According to state prosecutor Michael Schietz, the Muslim man 'became enraged, because anal intercourse is taboo for Muslims, and because they were being treated derogatorily by acquaintances when they realised what they had been doing.'
Schietz added that the woman had been worried that their boyfriend was going to leave them so had filmed the video and then threatened to distribute it if they ever walked out on them
The man claimed that they had tried to kill themselves at first with the six-inch kitchen knife by prodding it in the area near their heart.

Their girlfriend had then tried to wrestle the knife off them and they got in a scuffle, during which they received the injuries to their neck. They said the injuries were an accident.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #4 Error Edition
Mirage Publishing, May 1987.
The original TMNT #4 was published in June 1985. In 1987 a second printing of #4 was ordered from the printers with a new cover. This was submitted to the printers along with the first issue of Tales of the TMNT #1. Unfortunately a printing mix-up occurred and TMNT #4 (2nd print) was produced with the correct title and number on the cover but had the cover art meant for Tales of the TMNT #1 instead.
According to a Mirage source the comic was recalled, with around 1,000 surviving the recall and 59,000 being pulped! Below is an image of the recalled issue:
The error was reported in an issue of the Comics Buyer's Guide (CBG) in 1989, stating that the error issue was scrapped, with Peter Laird quoted as saying "very few" copies survived:
The issue was subsequently reprinted with the correct cover art and below are images of the reprinted TMNT #4 (2nd print, or 3rd now!) with the correct cover art and Tales of the TMNT #1:

end of useable crypto in browsers?
Hi, This is not a security vulnerability in itself, "just" a trend undermining the trust architecture of the whole internet :) I think it is very important, and wonder why I don't see any discussion of it. If this is not the right forum to discuss it, please direct me to the right place. The problem is: Browser developers are dropping support for X509 key generation. Yes, <keygen> have its problems. But window.crypto - which is meant to replace it - have no way to save keys in the browser's keystore. Instead of going to some cross-browser and cross-OS support for key management, we are now in a state where there are browser/OS combinations (stable chrome with non-windows OS), where there is no way to generate and store a key to be later used for ssl authentication. Looking at the related bug reports it seems that browser developers do not even understand the problem this creates. Any ideas on how to make them understand the scale of the doom we are facing right now? _______________________________________________ Sent through the Full Disclosure mailing list https://nmap.org/mail carrier/listinfo/fulldisclosure Web Archives & RSS: http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/

Taoiseach Enda Kenny has said Ireland will not support debt relief for Greece as crisis talks continue in Brussels.
Speaking to reporters on the way into the European Union leaders summit in Brussels, they were critical of the tax-raising measures the Greek government has proposed to try to reach a deal with its creditors.
Mr Kenny said the eurogroup meeting of finance ministers had been adjourned again as there did not seem to be credible papers on the table.
“From our point of view we want to encourage a system to help Greece and the people in Greece but it is very important that the propositions that are tabled make economic sense and that they are financially sustainable and fair,” they said.
Mr Kenny firmly ruled out Irish support for a write-off of Greek debt but an Irish official said the Taoiseach had stated their support for “debt reprofiling” – altering the repayment terms.
Mr Kenny said they had pointed out at a meeting earlier on Thursday of the European People's Party (EPP) group of leaders that Ireland had emerged from its crisis by pursuing pro-growth policies.
“I pointed out at the EPP that in Ireland's case we did not increase income tax; we did not increase VAT; we did not increase PRSI but we put up alternatives to those measures that were proposed in order to keep a pro-growth policy and to make our country competitive and to provide jobs for our people.”
They said that in the later discussion with the other EU leaders they would repeat those changes that Ireland was able to make to underpin the recovery.
“It is difficult to see the beneficial effect of measures that increase the tax on labour that increases income tax and increases PRSI. These are not in the interest of growth. That is what the discussions are about.
“I think there is a frustration among the ministers of finance that they don't have figures they can work off,” said the Taoiseach.
Asked if Ireland would support debt relief for Greece they answered simply. “No.”
They predicted that it was going to be difficult to conclude on Thursday. “I can see this going into the weekend but clearly we are in the closing hours to making a decision here.”
With no deal yet in sight for Greece, EU leaders are meeting in Brussels for a two-day summit at the European Council headquarters. Separately euro zone finance ministers are meeting in an adjacent building along with Greek officials and Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis in an attempt to hammer out a deal.
The 's finance ministers' meeting – the fourth in less than a week – has been adjourned briefly to allow Greece to come forward with further proposals.
The meeting, which began at 1.30pm local time (11.30am Irish time), saw both sides present different proposals after talks between the Greek Prime Minsiter Alexis Tsipras and IMF managing director Christine Lagarde and ECB president Mario Draghi, failed to yield a common agreement.
Mr Tsipras, who is attending the summit of EU leaders, rang the Greek President earlier on Thursday to update them on the negotiations.
Arriving at the summit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said negotiators had “not yet made the necessary progress” in the talks, adding that “in some places we feel that we are falling back a bit”.
With Britain's pledge to renegotiate its relationship with the EU and the migration crisis in the Mediterranean also on the agenda of the two-day summit, euro zone leaders may hold a separate summit on the fringes of the meeting, perhaps overnight, in an attempt to secure a breakthrough on the deal, though a further meeting over the weekend is also possible.
Nortriptyline has been found to cause a ten-fold increase in suicidal thoughts in men when compared to its competitor escitalopram. These findings are published in the open access journal BMC Medicine.
The research was carried out by Dr. Nader Perroud from the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, who headed up GENDEP, an international team. Dr Perroud said "Suicidal thoughts and behaviours during antidepressant treatment have prompted warnings by regulatory bodies". They continued "the aim of our study was to investigate the emergence and worsening of suicidal thoughts during treatment with two different types of antidepressant."
Both escitalopram and nortriptyline have their effect through the mood modulating neurotransmitter systems. The former is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), preventing serotonin from re-entering the cell and thereby prolonging its effect on nerve synapses. The latter is a tricyclic antidepressant that inhibits the reuptake of noradrenaline, and to a lesser extent, that of serotonin.
The study was carried out on 811 individuals with moderate to severe unipolar depression. Whilst an overall trend in reduction of suicidal thoughts was observed, men who took nortriptyline were found to have a 9.8-fold increase in emerging suicidal thoughts and a 2.4-fold increase in worsening suicidal thoughts compared to those who took escitalopram.
Perroud concludes, "Our findings that treatment-emerging and worsening suicidal thoughts may also be associated with psychomotor activation triggered by antidepressants needs to be investigated in future studies. The study also refutes the idea that newer antidepressants such as the SSRIs are worse than older medications in terms of increasing suicidal thoughts."
Stopping children from watching TV really does make them healthier and less fat, according to one of the few studies to observe the effects of intervening directly in their watching habits.
"Television viewing is related to consumption of fast food and foods and beverages that are advertised on television. Viewing cartoons with embedded food commercials can increase choice of the advertised item in pre-schoolers, and television commercials may prompt eating," Leonard Epstein of the State University of New York in Buffalo and their colleagues wrote in the journal Archives of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine.
They and their team investigated whether encouraging or coercing children into cutting down their viewing time made them healthier.
They started with 70 children aged between four and seven who were in the most obese 25% of the population, according to measurements of their body mass index. In half of the children's homes the team fitted limiting devices to their TVs and computers which prevented them from watching for more than a pre-set amount of time. The children could decide when and what they watched, but if they exceeded their weekly allowance the device would shut down until the end of the week.
Each month, the team reduced the children's TV time by 10% until it had dropped by a half compared with the original score of 25 hours. On average the restricted children watched 17.5 hours less TV a week, compared with 5.2 hours less for the group that did not have any restrictions.
The team found that in the group who had their TV watching curtailed, the children's daily calorie intake dropped by more than 300 from 1,550, or around 150 more than the drop in the control group.
The TV-restricted group also lost weight and ended up with an age-adjusted BMI more than 0.2 lower, from around 19.2, after two years than at the start. Their reduction was more than 0.1 higher than the control group.
The first group were also less sedentary, but they were not more active. The authors state that fitting a device to limit TV viewing time takes the pressure off busy parents who are trying to police their children's activity.
"Using technology to modify television viewing eliminates parental vigilance needed to enforce family rules and reduces the disciplinary action needed if a child exceeds their or their sedentary behaviour limits," they wrote.
Source: Yates to testify on warning White House about Flynn
J. David Ake / AP
WASHINGTON — Former acting attorney general Sally Yates is expected to testify to Congress next week that they expressed alarm to the White House about President Donald Trump's national security adviser's contacts with the Russian ambassador, which could contradict how the administration has characterized their counsel.
Yates is expected to recount in detail their Jan. 26 conversation about Michael Flynn and that they saw discrepancies between the administration's public statements on their contacts with ambassador Sergey Kislyak and what really transpired, according to a person familiar with that discussion and knowledgeable about Yates's plans for their testimony. The person spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to pre-empt the testimony.
The person said Yates is expected to say that they expressed alarm to White House counsel Don McGahn about Flynn's conversation with Kislyak. White House officials have said that Yates merely wanted to give them a "heads-up" about Flynn's Russian contacts.
Flynn was ousted weeks after the Yates conversation with White House officials. They initially maintained Flynn had not discussed Russian sanctions with Kislyak during the transition period, but after published reports said the opposite, then admitted they misled them about the nature of that call.
Yates's scheduled appearance before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee, alongside former intelligence director James Clapper, will provide their first public account of the conversation with McGahn. It will also represent their first testimony before Congress since Yates, an Obama administration holdover, was fired in January for refusing to defend Trump's travel ban.
They were previously scheduled to appear in March before a House committee investigating Russian interference in the presidential election, but that hearing was canceled.
(NaturalNews) The FDA has announced an immediate change to the labeling of drugs in a family that includes popular impotence drugs, warning that they may lead to sudden, severe and potentially permanent hearing loss.The erectile dysfunction drugs in the phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) class include Pfizer's Viagra, Eli Lilly's Cialis and GlaxoSmithKline's Levitra. Also receiving a label change will be blood pressure drug Revatio.The FDA reviewed side effect reports on the drugs after a case study was published in thein 2007, reporting that a 44-year-old man had suffered sudden hearing loss after only 15 days on Viagra. Upon review, the FDA uncovered 29 post-approval reports of patients undergoing sudden hearing loss from PDE5 drugs. In two-thirds of cases, the hearing loss appeared to be permanent. Hearing loss was sometimes, but not always, accompanied by dizziness or ringing in the ears. The majority of cases involved only one ear."Because some level of hearing loss is usually associated with the aging process, patients on these drugs may not think to talk to their doctor about it," said Janet Woodcock, the FDA's chief medical officer.The FDA advises all patients on PDE5 erectile dysfunction drugs to stop taking the medication immediately upon the first sign of sudden hearing loss, and to seek immediate medical care."Because Revatio is used to treat a potentially life-threatening condition, the FDA does not recommend [that] patients abruptly stop taking this medication," the agency said. Such patients "should consult their physician if they experience sudden problems with their hearing.""The fact that the FDA is just now finding out about the risk of sudden hearing loss from impotence drugs demonstrates the failure of its drug approval process to identify serious health risks before drugs are approved," said consumer health advocate Mike Adams. "The truth is that most newly-approved prescription drugs are unleashed upon the population as large-scale experiments, and neither the drug's manufacturer nor the FDA really has any idea of the true dangers of the drug."
It's a case that's captured everyone's attention — pirates, drug trafficking, hit men, government intrigue. By now, few people haven't heard about Silk Road, run by the now notorious Dread Pirate Roberts, a pseudonym from the film “The Princess Bride.” It's an interesting next chapter to perhaps the biggest news story of 2013 — Edward Snowden's revelations about NSA cyber snooping. Although there is new speculation about whether the FBI had help from the agency, it certainly showed the NSA that it too can flex its technology muscles, as it shut down purportedly a billion dollar illegal drugs website and nabbed its operator last week.
On Wednesday, Ross William Ulbricht, the alleged Silicon Valley-based mastermind, was ordered to New York City to face federal charges for running Silk Road. The site itself used sophisticated technology to keep ahead of the law. With the help of modern anonymizing software, it was able to operate under the radar and out of sight from law enforcement — or was it?
Silk Road was a secretive drug-dealing site as well as the home of other nefarious criminal activities. It operated in the underbelly of the Internet, the “dark web” that leverages Tor (The Onion Router) technology to obfuscate the website's users and its operator. Until last week, many believed that Tor was unbreakable, or at least there were no known breaks.
As information comes to light about the NSA's spying techniques, it is clear that the Feds have the ability to decipher most, if not all, of the encryption technology available today. Amazingly, this time last year, even most of us uber IT guys thought it was unbreakable. The furor over the NSA surveillance program has stirred a national debate, if not a global one. Knowing that governments can spy on us at will has implications for the bad guys — and the good guys.
It's early in the prosecution of the Silk Road accused, so we know few technical details about how the FBI was able to track them down. And because of “national security interests,” we may never know. But according to the criminal complaint, the suspect made many “operational security mistakes” which led to their capture. The Tor project team was quick to say, “Tor can not protect you if you use your legal name on a public forum.” Apparently, Mr. Dread Pirate Roberts fell into the trap that many of us innocently do, namely, thinking that social networks are even remotely private. While much of the Dreads' site was hardened via Tor, their postings on sites like LinkedIn and Google+ were inherent breaches in security.
Presumably, the cry to upgrade our workforces' technical skills is being taken to heart by criminals too. The alleged operator of Silk Road was not your run-of-the-mill criminal but rather a degreed engineer and physicist who apparently has some IT skills as well. And like many technology companies, this billion dollar business operated in the preferred location of many high-tech companies, San Francisco, California.
Silk Road was designed using the popular anonymizing technology, Tor, which covers the tracks of its users, including their browsing history, identity and physical location. Tor, an open-sourced project, is at the core of Silk Road and is readily available to anyone as a free download. The Tor network passes web requests through a series of participating servers and uses randomly generated, non-readable URL addresses that ultimately hide client and server communications from unintended eyes. In fact, as the number of Tor users increases, the odds that someone could breach Tor-based communications becomes even lower.
With a plethora of technologies available to help criminals mask their online activities, it's not surprising that more are going high-tech. Another technology ingredient that makes it difficult to uncover illegal marketplaces like Silk Road is Bitcoin — an internet monetary system that is not controlled by a central bank. When used in conjunction with Tor, there is no money trail, which has historically been an effective crime-solving technique. At the same time, Bitcoins can be converted to conventional offline currencies like the dollar or euros quite easily.
The Silk Road affair will no doubt reignite questions about online surveillance and spying. The government will say that without these abilities, they could not stop criminals like the Dread Pirate Roberts from hiding in the vast Internet. The rest of us will claim that government spying infringes on our civil liberties.
Ideally, there should be a happy medium to balance the government's need to use technology for fighting crime and law abiding citizens' right to privacy (personally, I'm less concerned about the rights of known criminals and criminal enterprises).
Score one for the Feds this week. It will be very interesting to see whether any collaboration between the two agencies comes to light. But you have to wonder what else they've got in their online spying arsenal, which they may very well already be using on the rest of us non-pirate Silicon Valley folk. Until we know, be smart about what you do and say online. And if you're tempted to take a walk on the dark side, here's the link to the Tor software.

The landscape on this watch pays homage to the graphics of the Super Mario World video games designed by Shigeru Miyamoto. With this watch we're exploring a link between the imagined world of the video game and the mental construct of time telling: both are artful, human inventions that operate with their own internal logic and rules; yet both appear to be entirely coherent and in a curious way ‘natural.'
The control of Mario in the game world makes them feel like an extension of our body - we move him, as we move our own limbs, without conscious thought. Similarly we internalize hours, minutes and seconds to the extent that we cannot see them as human invention.
Along with the image of the Sun and Moon, the hour disk features a revolving image with scenes of the Mario landscape that gradually changes over the course of the day. The minutes and seconds are displayed in the center dial and these run in the conventional way, so each marker on this dial corresponds to five minutes or seconds.
"Sun and Moon" watches were first produced in England in the late 1600s during a period of experimentation with ways to represent the time. We really like this representation of time as it is both elegant and logical.

Wham! Pow! Crash!
The athletes in the Boston Derby Dames — Boston's first and only all-female, flat-track roller derby league — have certainly taken their share of hits through the years.
But embracing their cartoonish, superhero identities of Maya Mangleyou, Estrogeena Davis, and Elle L Cool Jam, to name but three skaters — that's always been part of the allure of their passionate pursuit.
Advertisement
On Jan. 31, however, the Dames as a whole face a much tougher hit: being locked out of their training space in Somerville's Union Square, one they've called home for the past three years.

Their landlord's news that their building and surrounding land had been sold came as a shock, but an almost inevitable one given its proximity to the recently revamped Assembly Row development. With a new MBTA Orange Line station on board and an extension of the Green Line down the tracks, rents and housing costs in the area have been increasing.
The space, rented at $4,000 a month, isn't pretty. Yet the women don't want to leave.
One flight up from an auto repair shop in an industrial neighborhood, the cavernous second-floor space features a coated cement floor marked by long cracks crisscrossing the three yellow painted circles of their flat track. A line of rusted steel support beams runs through the center of the room, with two beams smack dab in the innermost circle — a place the skaters do their best to avoid — wrapped in blankets tied with rope.
Jim Davis/ Globe Staff Joslyn Vendola, aka "McSlammer" is pictured at a practice session of a Massachusetts roller derby team in Somerville.
But the skaters say that they've been lucky.

“We love this floor,” said board member Kelli ‘Coopa Troopa' Cooper of Somerville, a 32-year-old nurse practitioner, citing the smooth surface, perfect for fast skating.
“Some surfaces are grippy,'' they said. “People are really picky about the stickiness.”
When the Dames were founded in 2005, they rented roller rinks, hockey rinks, and gyms on a per diem basis. It's a path they might need to traverse again while scouring Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville for a new permanent spot that's accessible 24/7.
“We don't need much,” said Karen ‘Tara-dactyl' Tarkulich, 24, of Jamaica Plain, a museum program coordinator who is a member of both the league's executive board and its search committee.
“A floor that is flat and smooth,'' they specified, preferably wooden or coated cement, “a space that's 120 feet by 85 feet, which includes an outer lane for the ref's skating and for safety, so you don't get hit and go into the wall. And there can't be poles in the space, or they have to be 5 feet or further from the track.''

The ideal space, Tarkulich said, would be in a safe neighborhood close to public transit, like “a grocery store that's closed, or any kind of industrial building or former warehouse.”
‘It's testing if you don't know where you're going to practice.'
Tarkulich sighs at the thought of per diem renting again.
“It's testing if you don't know where you're going to practice day to day. Skaters need different wheels for different surfaces,” they said. “It changes the way you skate when you constantly have to relearn how to skate on a different surface.”
Jim Davis/ Globe Staff The space in the building that is being sold isn't pretty, but it has been their practice home for years.
The league, they said, owns a “sport court,'' a heavy, portable cover that can overlay a flat surface, but it requires a few intensive hours to transport, install, and deconstruct.
“This is more than a sport,” said Katherine ‘Space Invader' Rugg, 28, of Somerville, who works at the Bruised Boutique (“the world's largest derby skate shop”) in Nashua and skates with both the Boston Massacres, the league's travel team, and with the Cosmonaughties, one of its four home teams.
“It's a community gathering for women, and also for young girls.”
Indeed, interest in the sport has grown so much, said Rugg, that a junior roller derby league recently formed for girls ages 7-17.
“It is a unique situation,” said Rugg, “but it's definitely possible. It's not a golden unicorn within the city. We definitely have certain needs, but it is possible.”

YASHWANT VAID STOOD ANXIOUSLY beside Vinod Kumar, as the latter deftly parted the beaks of a pigeon, which shrank from their touch. Kumar poured several drops of an orange liquid down the bird's throat and asked Vaid, “Where did you buy it from?”
“In front of Jama Masjid,” Vaid, a primary school teacher, replied timidly.
Vaid had bought a pair of pigeons as pets for Rs 300 from a pigeon seller outside the mosque; they later discovered that one of them, with striking black, grey and white feathers, had a paralysed neck. Vaid brought the pigeon to Charity Birds Hospital in the premises of the Digambar Jain temple in Delhi's Chandni Chowk. They had intended to leave the bird there, but Kumar, a veterinary compounder at the hospital, admonished him, and told them to take it home. “If it were your child,” Kumar said, “could you have deserted it like this, at a time when it needs you the most?”
Snyder apologizes on Tuesday for decisions that caused the Michigan city's water supply to be poisoned by lead as top state environment official resigns
Michigan governor Rick Snyder apologized on Tuesday for the debacle that caused the city of Flint's water supply to be poisoned by lead, while the top state environment official resigned in light of a report that chiefly placed the blame for the crisis on their department.
The resignation was the latest in the crisis that has consumed the city of 100,000, as local doctors have warned in recent weeks that contaminated drinking water flowing from household taps may have affected more residents than originally thought.
Flint's 'toxic soup' polluted water worse for children than thought, doctor says Read more
In a statement issued Tuesday, Snyder said the resignation of Michigan Department of Environmental Quality director (MDEQ) Dan Wyant was “appropriate to accept”, but they added that changes in leadership won't be enough.
“I understand there can be disagreements within the scientific community,” Snyder said. “That is why I have directed both the departments of environmental quality and health and human services to invite every external scientist who has worked on this issue to be our partners in helping us to improve Flint water.”
The governor also apologized for the pollution problems, in what appears to be the first instance they have directly offered an expression of regret since the crisis arose several months ago.
“I want the Flint community to know how very sorry I am that this has happened,” they said. “And I want all Michigan citizens to know that we will learn from this experience, because Flint is not the only city that has an aging infrastructure.”
Flint has been embroiled in a never-ending stream of water quality issues that began in April 2014, when the city started pulling water from a local river as a cost-saving measure. The switch took place while Flint was operated by a state-appointed emergency manager, who held vast powers to oversee day-to-day operations, as the Rust Belt city was buckling under financial straits.
Residents immediately raised concerns about water that was suddenly cloudy, odorus and tasted rancid. Within months, General Motors had stopped using Flint water at a local engine plant because it was rusting machine parts. Initial tests also revealed elevated levels of chemical compounds in the water supply that can lead to liver or kidney issues.
Nonetheless, state environmental officials downplayed residents' complaints and vehemently disputed local studies that found a link between elevated blood-lead levels among children and the water source switch, until, in October, Snyder conceded the situation had become a “public safety issue” and announced a $12m plan to transfer Flint back to its previous supply with the city of Detroit.
It was the lackadaisical approach by the MDEQ in addressing the crisis – from failing to properly treat the Flint river to officials belittling responses to public outcry – that bears the “primary responsibility for what happened in Flint” and must be held accountable, a Snyder-appointed task force said on Tuesday in a three-page report of interim findings.
The task force was created by Snyder to review what caused the situation and issue future recommendations. Along with Wyant, the environmental department's spokesperson, Brad Wurfel, also resigned on Tuesday – saying he's “particularly satisfied” with how they have “trained department staff to better communicate with the public and the press, and other departments”.

According to the task force's report, the department's communication with the public often left much to be desired. The typical response offered by Wurfel and the agency on concerns about Flint's water, the task force said, was “one of aggressive dismissal, belittlement, and attempts to discredit” independent studies.
“We find both the tone and substance of many MDEQ public statements to be completely unacceptable,” the task force said. “In a real way, the MDEQ represents the public, including the very individuals it treated dismissively and disrespectfully in public statements.”
The reported continued: “What is disturbing about MDEQ's responses … is their persistent tone of scorn and derision. In fact, the MDEQ seems to have been more determined to discredit the work of others – who ultimately proved to be right – than to pursue its own oversight responsibility.”
'We were paying to poison our kids': lead in Michigan city's water hits children Read more
Snyder said Tuesday that they also plan to meet with Flint mayor Karen Weaver to discuss additional measures the state can take to offer assistance. Earlier this month, Weaver declared a state of emergency over the contaminated water supply, which comes amid calls for a criminal investigation and a pending class-action lawsuit.
Following the switch to the Flint River, researchers had found the proportion of children who experienced elevated blood-lead levels had spiked from 2.1% to 4%. In some areas, the number increased to as high as 6.3%, with blood lead levels above five micrograms per deciliter – an amount described officially as a public health concern. An earlier study, conducted by researchers from Virginia Tech, a group of citizen volunteers and the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, found that water in 10% of homes it tested in the city had 25 parts per billion of lead, far exceeding the Environmental Protection Agency's action level of 15 parts per billion.
Low-level exposure of lead can produce long-term health effects, particularly in young children, in the form of behavioral problems and learning disabilities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is no safe level of lead exposure.
State lawmakers praised the announcement from Snyder on Tuesday.
“If these personnel moves and change in tone lead to a more aggressive response and resources to improve public health, then we are finally making progress,” said state senate minority leader Jim Ananich in a statement. “I still believe that legislative hearings will be required to get all the answers and help shape the necessary policy changes, and ensure this never happens again.”
Despite Snyder's remarks and the shakeup at MDEQ, the task force said Tuesday that establishing responsibility is a “critical and urgent need” that shouldn't wait until its final report is released next year.
“The city of Flint's water customers … deserve a commitment to properly assess responsibility and ensure accountability,” the report said. “They also deserve a commitment to needed mitigation in both the short and long term.”
The task force didn't mince words in the report's conclusion:
“The Flint water crisis never should have happened. Having failed to prevent it, state government should coordinate a sustained public-health focused response to remedy, to the fullest extent possible, the impacts on the Flint community.”

An Open Letter to Co-Dependent Parents Who Are Raising Overly Dependent Children
Dear Parents:
On behalf of your friends without children, I'm officially serving notice that you suck at being our friends.
We respect and admire you as parents, and we support your decision to have a family. However, we feel that once children entered your life, you stopped being the friend we thought you were. We have been shuffled to the bottom of your priority list, and our calls have gone unanswered. You broke up with us, abandoned us for another, and frankly, we're a little miffed.
I know, I know. We just don't understand the challenges of parenthood. Trust me, I've heard that argument before. For the record, I'll stipulate that we the childless cannot know exactly what it's like to be parents, but we're still educated, intelligent, aware adults and thus capable of forming a decent approximation. Besides, as your friends, we're watching and participating in perhaps the finest documentary ever created on the subject.
We witnessed your transition from beer-drinking, coupe-driving, softball player to juicebox-loving, SUV-owning, Lego builder. To accommodate your new schedule, we traded nine o'clock reservations and late-night theater for 5 pm mac n' cheese and home screenings of Toy Story 12.
As babysitters, we spooned creamed carrots, played with Barbies, and changed poopy diapers. We attended birthday parties without fail and suffered the “Which one is yours?” question a hundred times. We went to soccer games, talking at the side of your head while you intermittently burst out with “Go Emma Go!” and “Pay attention to the game, Brandon!” We sat on your couch swirling cheap wine and looking at photos for thirty minutes while you read storybooks and tried to settle Mason down for bed, after which, we'd awkwardly attempt to resume conversation to the hum of the white noise machine. “Sorry, what were we talking about?” you'd say, to which we'd often reply, “Oh nothing, we should probably get going and let you get some downtime.”
No, we get it. We also understand the other primary defense: they grow up so fast, we don't want to miss anything, they're only young once, yada yada. Certainly no one expects you at the bar while Lucas takes their first steps or debuts “Dada” to the babysitter. But of the 365 days in a year, is it too much to ask that you carve out a night or two a month to meet us for a cocktail, a game, anything by yourselves? Must you have every meal with little Chloe? Will Evan be irreversibly damaged if Dad misses bath time occasionally? Can't Madison go to bed once in a while without Mommy reading Goodnight Moon?
I'm not suggesting equal time, but today's parents seem to need their children too much, and consequently, children are smothered beneath constant care. Parents drive their kids to school, attend play dates with them, hover over them while they do homework, and in general, attempt to shield them from every perceptible danger.
I'll take it a step further and say that it's in your child's best interest not to be there all the time. While I was growing up, my parents had their own lives, and we were sometimes left to our own devices and often told to go outside and entertain ourselves. We learned creativity, free play, and social skills, uninterrupted by overly protective adults. Yes, we sometimes came home with bloody knees, hurt feelings, or stolen bubble gum, but it was all part of growing into our independent selves.
I contend that a certain amount of “away time” is good for your children. They will come to understand that they are not the sole reason you exist. Liam will learn to appreciate that Mommy and Daddy occasionally spend time with their friends and that having friends and nurturing those relationships are important. Olivia will develop a certain measure of self-reliance, self-confidence, and self-esteem by managing a few hours on their own. Ethan will be disciplined by and learn to function in the presence of a non-parental adult—the babysitter—and in doing so, he'll develop a respect for the authority of adults other than Mom and Dad.
Let me be clear: I'm not saying you're parenting poorly. However I am suggesting that perhaps you're parenting too much and that your priorities might benefit from a slight re-balancing. You're so entangled in your children that you are unable to assess the situation objectively. Through the filter of parenthood, you don't see that our relationship has changed because you have changed.
Sometimes, perhaps in frustration, it's been said that we should just find other friends without kids. Newsflash: we did that already! We found you, before you had children, and furthermore, we befriended you for who you were as an individual. We didn't select you because we happened to get pregnant at the same time, because we have similar questions regarding baby formulas and skin rashes, because Hannah and Avery are in the same 3rd grade class, or because Noah and Jayden both like Spiderman-themed sleepovers. Rather, we became your friend because we value your presence in our life. We're in it for the long haul, and we've stood by and watched the short-term, task-specific friends become obsolete as this or that phase of your child's life passed, simultaneously wondering why we're undervalued simply because we don't have children.
Moreover I ask, what will you do when your kids begin to shun you during adolescence, when they leave for college, when they forge their own path in the world? Will you make new friends at empty-nester support group meetings, or are you shamelessly assuming we'll wait for you?
If we sound upset, it's because we've put too much time and energy into our friendships to be put on a shelf. Our patience is wearing thin, and the truth is, we miss you.
Your soon-to-be ex-friend,
Michael Whalen
A hedge funder is making noise about bringing down the salaries of executives at Morgan Stanley. Good. The government sure hasn't been successful at holding down corporate executive salaries, so maybe the market should work its magic—let hedge funds squeeze a few extra percentage points of profit in return for holding down the paychecks of the bosses of the banks they invest in. A worthwhile deal for the public. And a vindication of capitalism's mythical self-regulatory powers!
Of course, in order for big activist investors to go to all the trouble of harassing banks enough that they get their shit together, big activist investors will first have to invest in banks. And, for the most part, they don't want to. Why? Because, as this excellent new Atlantic story by Frank Partnoy and Jesse Eisinger shows in painstaking detail, the information that banks provide about their own financial situation is widely assumed to be untrustworthy.
Some four years after the crisis, big banks' shares remain depressed. Even after a run-up in the price of bank stocks this fall, many remain below "book value," which means that the banks are worth less than the stated value of the assets on their books. This indicates that investors don't believe the stated value, or don't believe the banks will be profitable in the future-or both. Several financial executives told us that they see the large banks as "complete black boxes," and have no interest in investing in their stocks. A chief executive of one of the nation's largest financial institutions told us that they regularly hear from investors that the banks are "uninvestable," a Wall Street neologism for "untouchable."
No big deal, just the planet Earth's most powerful financial institutions (which were recently bailed out by you and me and your mama) are considered by the most sophisticated investors in America to be so opaque in their dealings that the risk they pose is not worth their profit potential. Anything could be going on inside banks, in other words, and there's no real way to tell from the outside. Until they collapse, and come back to you, and me, and your mama, with their hands out. In the meantime, if they're doing well, they'll continue paying their executives huge sums.
Banks despise regulation, yet they expect to be rescued by the public when their bets go bad. This is a simple explanation of why "Too Big to Fail" financial institutions are now and will forever be bloodsuckers on the American public, until they are properly regulated. It seems insane that our legislators have not corrected this oversight, until you consider the fact that money buys legislative power in our political system, and the fact that banks have all the money. Then it makes perfect sense.
In the meantime, "wages have fallen to a record low as a share of America's gross domestic product," meaning that all of America's gains in productivity have helped out you, and me, and your mama not at all. Workers see no gains; investors, and executives, and bankers funnel all the gains to themselves. Until things go wrong, and the workers are asked to bail out the bankers again. It's not that complicated. It's a ripoff.
This is why they invented socialism.

— Lawyers for a 92-year-old African-American woman, along with multiple civil rights groups, filed one of two lawsuits Monday that challenge the state's sweeping elections changes just hours after Gov. Pat McCrory signed them into law.
That suit, filed by the state chapter of the NAACP and the Advancement Project, alleges that Rosanell Eaton's constitutional right to vote is threatened by the new law, which requires voters to show photo identification when they go to the polls, starting in 2016.
"North Carolina is the first state since the Supreme Court Voting Rights Act decision to pass a discriminatory voting law," Advancement Project Director Penda Hair said in a statement Monday.
Hair said Eaton was one of the first African Americans to vote in North Carolina and has continued casting ballots for 70 years, but the new law's photo ID requirement would disqualify them from future elections because the name on their birth certificate doesn't match the name on their driver's license.
"With the stroke of their pen, Gov. McCrory has transformed North Carolina from a state with one of the nation's most progressive voting systems, where we saw some of the highest voter turnout rates of the last two presidential elections, into a state with the most draconian policies we've seen in decades, policies that harken back to the days of Jim Crow," Hair said.
The other lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of North Carolina Legal Foundation and the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, tackles provisions of the law that cut a full week from the early voting period, eliminate same-day voter registration and prohibit "out-of-precinct" voting.
The omnibus law, which passed the General Assembly last month and was signed by McCrory Monday, also makes dozens of other changes to how the state conducts elections, which will start taking effect this fall and continue through 2014 and beyond. Those include banning straight-ticket voting and pre-registration for 16 and 17-year-olds.
In a YouTube video statement, McCrory said the new law will safeguard the election process.
"Protecting the integrity of every vote cast is among the most important duties I have as governor," they said. "It's why I signed these common-sense commonplace protections into law."
Opponents, however, have called it a radical voter suppression law.
"What does cutting back the opportunity to vote early in this state have to do with increasing integrity?" said Bob Phillips with Common Cause, a good government group. "I don't understand it, and I think a lot of people don't, and I think it's fair to ask those questions."
Phillips said they are concerned about the law allowing corporations to make unlimited donations to parties, raising the amount of money a donor can give to a politician and making it harder to know who paid for a political ad.
"Other things that have nothing to do with voter ID, nothing to do with voting, have again been repealed," Phillips said. "I think it's harmful to our democracy."
Diversified indexed fund based on cryptocurrency for Europeans
“Europe's first diversified indexed fund based on cryptocurrency is launching from Zug Valley. It is to be registered via FINMA (Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority). It personifies the first and initial investment vehicle for digital assets in the European market”
Index provider renowned for investing in digital currency can calculate cryptocurrency index. These providers are forward to invest in the largest crypto coins by liquidity and market capitalizations. This includes Bitcoin, Ether, Ripple and other digital coins.
This process facilities high level of index's diversification and reduce the volatility of funds for investors. Whilst assuming and ensuring the emergence and growth rate of new currency outpace the security markets and traditional equities.
Jan Brzezek, CEO of cryptofund AG stated the differences among the predecessors and a new fund. It fails to get approval from regulators.
We recognized the growing demand of qualified investors for a regulated and transparent gateway to cryptocurrencies and realized that we need a proven and recognized legal framework allowing qualified investors to invest in cryptocurrencies. Unlike the Winkelvoss-ETF, which was rejected by the SEC, we use the regulated and proven Swiss fund structure according to KAG [Swiss Collective Investment Schemes Act], where the asset manager, the fund management company and the custodian bank are legally separate from each other. The Fund will be highly diversified and will not list on an exchange and exclusively target qualified investors.
Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss – Founder of Gemini Exchange was launching the first ever Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF). But in March 2017, SEC (securities and exchange commission) has rejected an application. Though, the matter has again reopened by SEC for public commentary. However, the securities and exchange commission is now looking for a similar kind application of an Ether -based ETF proposed by Etherlndex Ether Trust.
Dr.Tobias Reichmuth – Chairan of the board for Crypto Fund AG stated that
“Private and institutional investors alike show a keen interest for cryptocurrencies as a deflationary value storage medium independent of central banks. Access via a regulated vehicle, to execution and safe storage were so far missing. The Cryptocurrency Fund™ will be the first regulatory fund globally which provides a safe and easy access to the rapidly growing cryptocurrency world.”
Marc P. Bernegger – Fine Tech Expert stated that there is no fluke for choosing Zug Valley as a base and noted
“The term ‘Crypto Valley' has quickly gained acceptance and demonstrates the concentration and growth of Cryptocurrency companies and foundations in the region of Zug and Zurich. It is also important to mention that Switzerland with its good reputationin asset management and stable regulation has already accepted virtual currencies as an asset class. In addition, the Swiss mountains offer safe and tested warehouses for digital assets.”
However, the launch of the fund is coercive in Q4 2017. And also the initial prospect with FINMA has been taken up.

Columnist Neal Peirce writes about the prospects for driverless cars and how they might change our cities.
What will the coming revolution of “autonomous driving” — self-driving vehicles — mean for our cities and metropolitan regions?
The answer is a lot. Eventually.
For decades, cars and trucks have had some automation with cruise control. Manufacturers have been phasing in automated parking for advanced models since 2003.
Backup and lane-change warning systems are installed in some auto models. And at this moment there are many experiments to open an era of totally driverless cars — including lasers, cameras, radar and similar technologies, spearheaded by such companies as Google, BMW, Toyota, Volvo and General Motors.
But don't look for zero-driver vehicles on roadways soon. State laws have uniformly required that motor vehicles have drivers, and that drivers must be able to control their vehicles.
Some laws even prohibit vehicles from steering, braking or accelerating by themselves. Still, Nevada, Florida and California have recently allowed driverless vehicles, at least for testing purposes.
But a nationwide switch-over to full and legal use of driverless vehicles could take many years — and a lot more proof of their safety. “We believe the individual should always have the ability to disengage and take over the system of a vehicle,” James Pisz, Toyota's North American corporate business-strategy manager, told a recent “Meeting of the Minds” policy conference in Toronto.
In the meantime, more and more features for fully automated driving — assuming the legal driver is still able to take control — will be appearing. They'll include mapping technology to steer to target destinations. Plus electronics to move in street and freeway traffic, react to flow and stops in traffic and avoid hitting bikers or pedestrians (even, Pisz suggests, “a black-clad figure at night”).
And then there's the formidable list of new issues to resolve. Will drivers need special training to control a self-driving vehicle? Will vehicles be able to speed — or will they be stuck at the speed limit even on an emergency trip to a hospital? Will a driver be allowed to text? If a self-driving car gets in a collision, does blame fall to the driver or the manufacturer?
The first totally driverless vehicles may be relatively slow-moving vans, operating on strictly defined routes to serve campuses, from parking to downtowns or sports events.
Bottom line: Truly independent, self-driving vehicles won't change our urban and metro form soon. But in 10 to 20 years, they might. And what might happen then? How will the life of cities and metro regions be changed?
One theory is that we'll see a return to the unrelenting suburban sprawl America experienced from the end of World War II to the advent of the Great Recession.
Why bother to live in the city, goes this theory, if you can live miles out, cruise to work texting, reading or sleeping, count on computer systems to minimize your actual travel time and then step out of your car at your destination and tell the vehicle to go off and find a parking space for itself?
But that may not be the ideal life for the vast numbers of people who actually value city — or suburban center — life.
We're into a new century with new tastes. A significant share of today's youth and families is showing less interest in driving, or in retreats to suburban getaways with multicar garages. Their pick, instead: the dynamism and attractions of urban living.
Plus, current-day urbanism isn't just being celebrated in big city centers — it's present in increasing numbers of lively neighborhood and suburban centers developing around our metros, and in small cities too.
There also are the advantages that automated driving can bring to cities themselves. A major scourge on urban landscapes has been the millions of parking slots thought necessary to draw anyone to live, work or recreate in their downtowns — a policy that's delivered sterile garages, even uglier open-air parking lots and flight to boring suburban corporate campuses.
In an era of driverless cars, it will be different. One will be able to step out of one's personal auto for work — or a movie, or a dinner at a restaurant — and then let the vehicle drive itself to (and come back) from its designated peripheral parking slot.
Or, in many cities, take a convenient transit ride home. Or ride one's own bike, or pick up a bike share.
To a degree, all this depends on a reasonably prosperous national economy. But given that, one can expect lots of infill slots for residences, stores and other urban activity taking shape.
We'll see denser, more walkable centers across the country, as smart developers note consumers' wish for lively mixed-use settings. In the end, my bet is that driverless cars won't stop all this activity — they'll just abet it.

Michael Parkhurst is the Columbus Crew SC captain and a U.S. international defender. In this guest blog, they write about preparing for the new MLS season.
LAKEWOOD, Fla. -- A new year and a new season beckon. It's the beginning of a long and arduous journey that will contain highs and lows throughout an 11-month run that will culminate with a heroic performance in MLS Cup and the hoisting of a trophy as confetti fills the sky.
So says every team at the start of preseason.
It was a short offseason for Crew SC -- the final was on Dec. 6, and we reported back on Jan. 21 -- and it's true that we begin 2016 with the memory of last year's MLS Cup still ingrained in our minds. It takes awhile to get over such a loss. I should know: I'm 0-4 in MLS Cup finals.
It hurts because winning a championship is our dream, and we were so close after putting in so much hard work. It's hurts because we had to beat the hottest team -- Montreal -- and the best team -- the Supporters' Shield-winning Red Bulls -- just to get to the final. It hurts because we lost to Portland in front of our home fans in an unbelievable atmosphere.
So yeah, it hurts. But, as the days and weeks pass, the pain decreases, even if it will never completely vanish. Looking back a decade to my time in New England, I still feel the pain of Pando Ramirez's volley hitting the net for LA in 2005 and Brian Ching's header one year later, the latter of which came one minute after we took the lead.
The pain is always there. But the focus moves on, and that's where Crew SC is now: Focused on the challenges of a new season and ready to put that hard work in all over again for another chance at the Cup.
Michael Parkhurst is preparing for their third season as a Columbus Crew player.
And so here we are in sunny Florida, taking the first steps toward the trophy and confetti. Before we open the season against the Timbers on March 6, much preparation and hard work must take place, both on and off the field.
It begins with two weeks of fitness, technical and tactical work, as well as integrating rookies and new signings. And more fitness. No games are played at this point, but it is an important time that builds the foundation for a new season.
Off-the-field stuff is vital to build team chemistry. It occurs naturally when the team is in a hotel together for two weeks. Van rides to and from training, breakfast and lunch at the hotel and dinners out all provide ample time to get to know one another and, perhaps more importantly, razz anyone and everyone about anything and everything.
Two weeks of tough training and multiple double days can lead to the occasional -- OK, constant! -- complaint from us professional athletes. Thus it becomes important to add humor, mostly at the expense of a teammate or coach, to lighten the mood and take the mind off sore, heavy legs.
The glamour of preseason! Crews SC coach Gregg Berhalter's car gets stuck in the mud.
It's all part of the process toward building a cohesive, effective and successful team, although things have changed throughout my 12 years as a pro. The game has become more demanding, the competition more fierce and the expectations much higher.
In my first couple of years with the Revolution, back in the mid-2000s, you didn't come into camp at anything near full fitness -- that's what the first two weeks were for. Preseason back then was also longer, at almost two months, which meant things could be more gradual.
And we enjoyed that process. Steve Nicol, always known as a player's coach, made sure that when we worked, we worked hard, but when we were off, we were free to enjoy ourselves and our surroundings.
Preseason in places like Costa Rica, Bermuda and Cancun sure allowed us to do that! Beach surroundings, training once a day and enjoying nightly group adventures around the local towns was the norm. It was a product of the times, and it worked for us.
In the years since, the science and evolution of the modern game have changed things for the better. For example, every training session is now monitored for workload through heart rate monitors and GPS systems. They track distance covered, speed, power and heart rate numbers to see how each player fared and to calculate the overall exertion of the group.
Such data tell the staff if they pushed us too hard (although they could just ask the complaining players!) or not hard enough (said no player ever). The information also helps to plan upcoming sessions with regard to duration and intensity. Everything is a science.
Some things have changed over the years, but the endgame remains the same for preseason: to prepare not only for opening day but also for the full MLS season. We get our bodies physically ready for Week 1 and our minds mentally ready for the entire campaign.
Every club's aim is to set a standard of play -- both physically and tactically -- and to try to improve upon that over the course of the season. The teams that do this the best will probably be the last ones fighting for the cup and the confetti.
And if that happens to be Crew SC, we'll probably look back at these first weeks in Florida and think: "Ah, it wasn't so bad after all!"

A comet's close encounter with the Sun has given scientists a look at a solar region that has never been visited by spacecraft.
In 2011, comet Lovejoy hurtled deep into the Sun's violent atmosphere - an area called the solar corona.
Telescope images have revealed how the comet's tail was pulled about by an intense magnetic field, allowing scientists to characterise this force for the first time.
The study is published in Science.
Dr Karel Schrijver, from the Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center in California, said: "The comet goes through an area of the solar atmosphere that we can't really observe.
"We can't go there because our satellites would melt, and we can't see it because there is not much light coming from it. But comet Lovejoy gave us a means to access a part of the solar atmosphere and solar magnetic field that we cannot get into in any other way."
Dancing tail
Comet Lovejoy, which is named after the Australian astronomer who discovered it, ploughed into the Sun's atmosphere on 15 December 2011.
With an advance knowledge of its orbit, scientists trained Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory and twin Stereo orbiters, as well as Japan's Hinode spacecraft to capture the event.
Hurtling towards the Sun at 600km (400 miles) a second, the comet appears as a fast-moving, bright speck followed by a long glowing tail.
Image caption Three solar missions trained their telescopes on the comet as it approached the Sun
The images reveal the comet getting increasingly bright as it enters the solar corona, where it encounters temperatures of millions of degrees Celsius. Its tail also begins to move.
Dr Schrijver explains: "The tail is not following the comet's head perfectly as we would expect it to follow... its tail gets locked onto the Sun's magnetic field, and gets flicked back and forth."
By studying the comet's movements, the researchers have been able to find out more about the properties of the magnetic field for the first time.
This, they said, was key.
Comets Comets are icy objects that release gas and dust as they orbit the Sun
A comet's distinctive tail is caused by solar radiation and a stream of charged particles called the solar wind
It is thought that they are material leftover from the formation of the outer planets
Another theory is that they formed outside our solar system Did comets bring water to Earth?
The Sun's magnetic field drives the strong solar winds and explosions that occur in the solar corona.
These violent events can blast out particles into space and cause "space weather", which can damage satellites and telecommunications infrastructure.
Currently, scientists are using computer models to try and understand the Sun's atmosphere and its magnetic field, but said that the data from comet Lovejoy would help them to improve this process.
New sun-grazer
After comet Lovejoy made its close approach, the scientists were surprised to see the ball of ice and dust survived, re-emerging on the other side of the Sun.
It's the first one we have seen that was large enough to survive close passage Dr Karel Schrijver, Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center
Two days later, though, it disintegrated.
Dr Schrijver said: "There have been about 1,600 Sun-grazing comets observed. But all of them vanished and none came out. It's the first one we have seen that was large enough to survive close passage - although not for very long."
Solar physicists are hoping for another attempt to capture another Sun-skimming comet later in 2013.
Comet Ison, which has been called a potential "comet of the Century" because of its size and orbit, will pass by the Earth at the end of the year, before making its way towards the Sun.
Despite International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach's plans to minimize the number of Olympic bid “losers” and to reform the IOC process to embrace the “two excellent candidates” in the 2024 race, both cities vying for the prize have outright rejected the possibility of accepting any consolation prize.
Just days ago Bach boasted “we have two excellent candidates from two major Olympic countries.”
They said that the possibility of awarding both the 2024 and 2028 Games to Paris and Los Angeles at the IOC Session in Lima this September was to be considered by a committee of four vice-presidents of the organization. With the five-city race whittled down to two after the early exits of Hamburg, Rome and Budapest in the face of public and political opposition – the IOC is desperate to hold on to the interest it has.
But by adding some spin Bach said of the two remaining candidates, “this is the position you like to be in.”
However for both Olympic bid rivals Paris and Los Angeles, the only position they want to accept is first place, the 2024 Games.
Paris 2024 Co-Chair Tony Estanguet told BBC Sport Tuesday “2024 is now or never for us.”
“We believe we have the strongest offer but it is only available for 2024.
“We can't host the Games in 2028 because we don't have the project available for 2028.”
“We have the guarantees, we have the public support, we have the political support, we have 95 per cent of existing venues. This is the fourth bid from Paris and 2024 is the centenary of the Games in Paris.”
Estanguet said there is nothing for Paris to negotiate if it came down to a deal between the two cities.
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti conveyed similar positioning to insidethegames Monday when they told the Olympic sport publication “We are competing for 2024.”
“Full stop.
“I would love to visit my friends in Paris in 2028.
“We have never contemplated anything else.”
Though there has been no official comment on which city would host first in the two Games scenario, wide speculation has placed Paris in the 2024 position due to the claimed limited availability of land for the Olympic Village at Seine-Saint-Denis, and because it would mark the centenary of the previous Games in Paris. That would leave LA in the 2028 spot.
Garcetti and the LA 2024 team haven't said that they wouldn't accept an offer to host in 2028, but it's clear that they're not negotiating on 2024 either.
“We present a unique stability here,” Garcetti added.
“That is why we are as focused on 2024 as we are.
“It is not about something way-off in the future. It's about we know we can deliver that year and what we are prepared to offer that year.”
Without a deal worked out by the IOC and the cities ahead of the Lima meeting, it would appear that 2024 would have to come down to a full membership vote to elect a winner. Then, offering the consolation prize to the other city would amount to a separate exercise.
But Estanguet further emphasized “either the IOC family wants to choose Paris for '24 or we will not come back for '28.”

HENRICO, Va. – Complimentary 7-foot Christmas trees, along with other holiday items, will be available for free on a first come, first served basis, on Sat., Dec. 5.
The items are compliments of “The Generosity Project,” who last year gave away 180 Christmas trees, wreaths and poinsettias to Richmond-area families. This year they hope to give away 200 Christmas trees.
Tree stands and lights, along with poinsettias and Christmas wreaths will be given out.
The items are only available on a first come basis, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday.
One merely has to stop by, say they need a tree, and take their place in the queue.
There will be more than free decorations to share. Adding to the festive atmosphere will be live music, snacks, coffee and children's activities.
The giveaway takes place at 2340 Pump Road, on about 19 acres of property with a pavilion, near the Knights of Columbus.
Just look for the signage which will be posted to help direct people to the site.
The Community West Church makes the donations possible, but Jerry Natale emphasized that it is less about the church and more about the community support, saying “it is out of our hearts that it was birthed.”
“We just want to make it a real simple, gracious event where people can come pick up a tree."
Low house prices make for lower debt service payments that benefit the economy as money money is freed up to circulate and buy goods and services.
Common sense dictates that spending less money on necessities boosts discretionary spending. When gas prices are low, the average commuter has more money left over to spend on everything else. The same is true for housing payments: the less a homeowner spends paying mortgage debt, the more money that homeowner has available to save, invest, or spend on goods and services in the economy.
If low debt service payments are good, why are politicians, lenders, realtors and homeowners obsessed with driving up house prices as high as possible? Doesn't it take more debt and more debt service to support sky-high house prices? Isn't that a drain on the economy?
Lenders came up with a novel solution: they allow existing homeowners to borrow against the rising value of their houses and spend that money. Rather than spend a few extra dollars in saved mortgage payments each month, lenders give homeowners humongous wads of cash they can spend all at once and stimulate the economy — at least until the bills come due.
As far as lenders are concerned, an economy dependent upon mortgage equity withdrawal is a win-win: they convince everyone high home prices and large debt service payments boost the economy (See: Real estate wealth effect is really a disguised Ponzi scheme). Further, they get to make copious quantities of cash from the hapless borrowers who live from one infusion of debt to another.
Sustainability is key
Rapidly rising house prices are not sustainable, and the HELOC dependency it creates provides an unsustainable economic stimulus certain to result in a painful crash. Financial market implosions purge irresponsible and unsustainable habits from the populace. HELOC dependency serves no one, not even the sheeple who got to enjoy it for a time. The unceremonious fall from entitlement is inevitable, and although the fall is emotionally devastating, getting off the HELOC heroin is better for borrowers in the long term.
The lower debt service payments will benefit the economy as money that previously went to a lender now circulates to buy goods and services.
May 17, 2016, Ben Lane
Americans … share of consumers' disposable income that's going to mortgage debt is now at its lowest level in 35 years – the percentage of disposable income going to service mortgage debt – hasn't been this low since 1980. … “Since the financial crisis, consumers are paying more attention to their debts, particularly longer term financial commitments such as homes and autos,” Blitzer said. “The Total Debt Service Ratio, which includes loans with scheduled payments, is close to a record low. The savings rate is now at about 5% of disposable income, slightly higher than its level in 2004-2006.” …
This may sound like just another statistic, but low debt-service payment obligations will serve as the basis for a sustainable economy less prone to the painful crashes from credit-induced expansions like we've had since the 1990s because the spending comes from current income rather than infusions of debt.
The report also shows that the national mortgage default rate is lower than what it was before the housing crisis began, according to David Blitzer, the managing director and chairperson of the Index Committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Lenders have only extended credit to borrowers capable of repaying those debts over the last several years. At the bottom of the credit cycle when standards are tight, default rates should drop to near record lows.
“In contrast to the low default rates on mortgages and auto loans, bank cards recently showed increased default rates,” Blitzer said. “The longer term post-crisis decline in the bank card default rate leveled off in 2014. Since then, it has been in a range of 2.5% to 3.2%,” Blitzer said. “Bank card, auto, and mortgage default rates are all lower than their pre-financial crisis levels. However, the bank card rate is more volatile than the others and more sensitive to consumer spending trends. Whether the default pattern for bank cards stabilizes remains to be seen.”
I want to believe
The promise of ever-increasing house prices and unlimited HELOC spending money is seductive. Everyone wants to get something for nothing, and despite the too-good-to-be-true obviousness of the fallacy of free money from housing, it happens often enough that the sheeple fall for it every time.
Like the gambler in Las Vegas feeding a slot machine, the California loan owner will buy any real estate they can to get their shot at HELOC booty. It's only a matter of time before we inflate another housing bubble and unjustly enrich another generation of useless Ponzis. I want to believe it won't happen, but those who want to believe in California housing gold will likely make another run at it.
A fork in the road
Many lenders will react to the news that debt-service payments are near record lows as a sign that they need to expand their business. Trillions of dollars of equity needs “liberation” and lenders are there to provide that freedom — and enslave another generation of foolish borrowers.
We are at an important crossroad. We can embrace the low debt-service paradigm and enjoy a slow but sustainable boost to economic growth, or we can reanimate another debt-service monster and boost the economy through unsustainable debt growth. The direction we choose will determine when the next bust occurs and how painful it is.

It has been a while since the last ‘Report In!', but we're back and kicking off a fresh new series with no one other than Arma 3's Sandbox Design Lead, Lukas Haladik!
We're often asked to let some of our people talk about what it's like to develop a game at BI. 'Report In!' gives you a more personal perspective on our team, a more detailed look at the way we go about our work, and fresh information about our ongoing projects.
Today we check in with Lukas Haládik and talk about what it means to create an authentic, enjoyable experience in a massive game environment. We also discuss some of the new ‘sandbox' features in Arma 3, reflect on the Alpha and briefly look into the future.
Introduction
Tell the people a little about yourself. What's your role? How long have you been with Bohemia Interactive? Which projects have you contributed on and what is your favorite BI game or mission?
[thumb class="pull-left" clear-xs]lukas_haladik.jpg[/thumb] My name is Lukas Haladik, but everyone at work calls me Luca (the ‘c' is pronounced as ‘ts'). I also come by the cheesy nickname ‘Ghost' or ‘Ghostone'. As one of the Design Leads on Arma 3, I'm responsible for all the sandbox features and assets in Arma 3. It means I'm responsible for all weapons, vehicles, equipment, houses, objects or modules that will be in the game. It also includes the scenario editor. Anyway, it's my fifth year here at Bohemia Interactive and it's been really cool. I started with Arma 2, and then I moved onto Operation Arrowhead and all of its DLCs. Afterwards, I worked on Take On Helicopters - and now Arma 3. Personally I'm a big fan of the Arma series, but I don't have a particular favorite mission. I mostly enjoy the missions where you have a certain feel of realism and you're required to make decisions.
And can you give us a random fact about yourself?
I'm the father of three beautiful girls :)
What's In The Box
Let's start from the very beginning. Can you elaborate on the meaning of ‘sandbox' in gaming (and Arma 3 specifically). What should we consider to be sandbox content?
[thumb class="pull-left" clear-xs]a3_report_sandbox_6.jpg[/thumb] Well, there's always been some confusion about when something can be called a ‘sandbox'. In my opinion, a true sandbox offers tools to players that let them do what they want and create their own experience. For example, Arma 3 does this by providing players with the powerful editor, which enables you to easily create own content. Some of the other games, that are usually referred to as sandbox games, I would say are open-world games. You can do whatever you want in that world, but within certain boundaries. A typical example would be Red Dead Redemption. You can do a lot of the things that you want, but it is still limited and you can't create your own content. Arma 3 on the other hand is both a sandbox and an open-world game. This idea is reinforced by the huge community, which is already – while the full game is still to be released – producing tons of content that you can play and use. It shows that the sandbox options in Arma 3 are limitless.
Not many games feature 290 km2 of virtual terrain. What kind of challenges does that bring along?
To give an example, we need to carefully consider how long the distances actually are that players have to cross. This, for example, helps to determine which vehicles should be in each faction. Specifically, in Arma 3, we now also have underwater transported – which literally adds a dimension on top (or below?) the sea, air, land vehicles.
That said, a huge terrain is particularly challenging for mission designers. In the case of Arma 3, players can take many different approaches to a single mission, which means you have to account for a limitless amount of mission combinations and actions. This freedom for the player means less scripted control over the experience by the designer.
Can you pick one new feature/task/concept you're working on now and tell a bit more about it?
Well, I'm working on a new squad concept. In the past our squads consisted of 10 soldiers, but now we are moving to a more concentrated squad concept with 8 men. We felt that it's too difficult to micro-manage 10 soldiers when you're the leader. A squad of 8, where each soldier has been assigned a specific role, gives you more leeway for leading and micro-managing. The roles are not fully decided yet, but it's coming along pretty well.
The scenario editor in Arma games has been a continuous source of creativity and fun. What is the most significant improvement to the editor in Arma 3?
The editor layout is now customizable, and people can choose from a couple of preset layouts. Alternatively, you can load external layouts, such as those created by the community.
Secondly, we added a mini-intel section, where you can quickly change the time or weather of the mission – including the settings for wind, rain, waves and lightning.
I personally really like the concealable UI, which gives you more space for editing on the screen. The buttons for ‘config' and ‘functions viewer' are also really useful. Without going into too much technical detail, there have been a lot of minor changes in different dialogues of the UI which made it more clear and accessible.
We've talked about the editor technically, but what about the missions you can make? An example of a good community mission?
The scenario editor in Arma 3 is a very powerful instrument. It enables you to make missions in as short a time as 5 to 10 minutes. I think players are sometimes a bit overwhelmed by the editor, but it's really quite simple to use, especially if you just want to create something like an urban firefight.
Of course if you're more into it, and want to make complex missions with different endings, you'd need some scripting skills. However, these are all things you can learn. Just join our forums and ask.
I really like the micro-management aspect in squad combat, so usually I'm creating simple missions with one ending - just to fool around and try different tactics. It's the freedom that really does it for me: here's your objective, deal with it. There's one mission from the community I remember in particular. It was the Occupation from BangaBob, which sort of merged my favorite game mode Domination with Insurgency.
Keeping Things in Czech
The Arma 3 Alpha has been released and in that time we've seen three updates. Could you name a few things that have changed or are being evaluated based on feedback?
We've taken the need for a stance indicator into serious consideration, as it was one of the most requested features. But there's always work to do in terms of balancing. Hence, we've recently hired a new game balance designer. The interviews we did were really exciting as we tried a different approach. The applicants had to answer our questions while playing a co-op game, and also tried to design and balance some of the weapons. We wanted to create a different experience for the applicants and also explore their gaming skills, their designing potential, overall creativity and communication skills.
[thumb class="pull-left" clear-xs]a3_report_sandbox_4.jpg[/thumb] But to elaborate, balance is really important - not only for content assets, but also in terms of small tweaks in the AI behavior, reaction and precision. Our goal is to make the game enjoyable and believable, which means that we need to cross-reference the game with reality, and make the best of it. You'll probably notice that in firefights, you are often being shot at but not killed instantly. This is the way we would like to go. Before, the AI was really deadly. This is definitely not to say that Arma 3 isn't challenging anymore, it's mostly less frustrating.
Looking ahead, what will your team work on towards release of the Arma 3?
We really need to focus on the basis of Arma 3's gameplay, which is infantry. I would like us to refine the controls and fluidity of the game play further. We also still need to revise the equipment, which can be improved in some aspects and needs more balancing. Also, we will be looking at the grenades and handling of weapons: there is a big recoil enhancement going on, and some more cool stuff about which we can hopefully tell more in the near future.
General questions
And after a long day of making games, what do you like to do to relax and unwind?
Play games, design board games, play guitar.
How does one become a game designer and what advice would you offer to aspiring game designers?
In the end, the best thing is just to show what you can do. Also, as a designer you should not only have fresh ideas, but also be realistic. Not everything is possible, not everything will make it into the game. It also means you have to be really strict and set your own priorities. The MoSCoW method is a good start. It helps to divide your own tasks in an efficient manner.
Cyber warfare ignited the virtual apocalypse – putting an end to all things digital. Leading a troop of code monkeys, you launch a final counter-attack to save that ONE game. Which would it be?
I would have to say Arma. Also because I'm familiar with the development process, and I could use it as a platform to create new games ;-)
More Sandbox

Sorry, Rupert Murdoch…Content Will Remain Free. Here Are the Facts:
Rupert Murdoch, in a Wall Street Journal Op-Ed, once again proclaimed the advertising business model dead and the era of free content over.
There is no doubt that Murdoch is an astute businessman. They have made a fortune in media, much of it in tabloids and by cozying up to dictatorships in countries such as China and Russia. They cynically titled the piece that they published in their own newspaper to further their business interests, “Journalism and Freedom.”
Generally speaking, I'm a fan of Murdoch. They say, “you can't argue with success” and I usually don't, nor do I want to. However, in this latest episode their reasoning is so divorced from the facts that I have doubts as to whether he's really serious.
I think their contention can be boiled down to this passage in the Op-Ed:
A business model that relies primarily on online advertising cannot sustain newspapers over the long term. The reason is simple arithmetic. Though online advertising is increasing, that increase is only a fraction of what is being lost with print advertising.
Well, not exactly…
Here are the facts:
Fact: Print revenues have increased since the dawn of the internet. According to ZenithOptimedia, US Print ad revenues from 1996 to 2008 have increased by $18 billion (from $50 Billion to $68 Billion) and globally they have increased by $50 Billion. (from $131 Billion to $181 Billion)
Some markets, such as the UK, have fared worse but when corrected for differences in market composition the story holds (more on that later)
Fact: Print's loss in market share has been less than Digital's gain. During the same 1996-2008 period, US Internet ad share has gone from 0% to 10% while Print ad share has dropped from 44% to 32%. By “simple arithmetic,” that's a gain of 10% for Internet and a loss of 8% for Print which means the decline in print share has been less, not more, than the gain for Internet.
To be fair, globally Print shares have decreased slightly more than Internet has increased (12% vs 10%). Still, to say that the the increase has only been a “fraction” of the Print loss is way off base.
Moreover, it's important where the losses have come from. Magazines have actually increased their shares, the loss has been completely restricted to newspapers. This shouldn't be surprising as the Internet has been very successful with classified advertising and not done so well with display advertising.
While it's true that newspapers are in serious trouble, the problem for the industry has more to do with their historical reliance on classified advertising. There are some fairly common sense ways to correct this and move toward display advertising, but newspapers have been slow to adopt them.
Fact: Much of the recent losses have been cyclical. The trends mentioned above are long term trends. The short term trends since 2007 look much worse for Print.
This shouldn't be surprising as magazine display advertising is highly dependent on durable goods, which drive the business cycle. In a downturn, people put off long term purchases and so it's inevitable that advertising expenditure in those categories falls off in a recession more than in the general market.
Furthermore, recessions create bloated inventories. Companies that need to empty their warehouses will focus more on direct response sales promotions and less on the display advertising that is Print's forte. In a recovery, this trend is reversed. (and Magazines did gain share during the last recovery).
Fact: People don't actually pay for print content. While there are exceptions, for the most part publishers don't make money on distribution and in many cases actually lose money. This is especially true with US magazines, in which roughly 85% of circulation is sold through highly subsidized subscriptions.
In effect, we're usually paid (albeit in paper, ink, gas, etc.) to read print content.
Fact: The Internet Makes things cheaper. On the web, anybody can publish (even me!). The notion that an increase in competition will not decrease prices fails to recognize a simple rule of economics. To believe that consumers will start paying for content assumes that the increase in demand will exceed the avalanche of supply.
Fact: Consumers show no aversion to ads. My wife complains about me all the time (with good reason), but I know they really loves me (at least they haven't divorced me yet). Consumers have a similar relationship with ads. They complain and watch, complain and watch.
Although counter-intuitive, the evidence with DVR's shows that even when people have the capability to skip ads, they watch them to a much greater extent than anybody expected.
While this seems incredible, it starts to make sense when you imagine a world without ads. Actually, in some places in the world, they don't have to imagine it. They actually experienced it and, as this Polish ad shows, the picture wasn't pretty.
If consumers show no inclination to avoid ads, why would they agree to pay for content? Unless the content is highly specialized, experience shows that they won't. Moreover, to attract ad money, most content creators are zealous in their pursuit of traffic from content aggregators.
Fact: He's Hedging. If anybody wants to read Murdoch's piece for themselves but don't want to pay for it, no problem! Just go to this page on the site “All Things Digital” and you'll find a preview and a link to the Op-Ed on the Wall Street Journal. Don't worry, Rupert won't mind. They own “All Things Digital” and the site is completely free!
The Way Forward
The truth is that there is nothing wrong with the advertising model. Yahoo!, which is largely free content ad model as you can get, generated nearly $2 billion in free cash flow even during the crisis year of 2008. Facebook also looks poised to become profitable (although Murdoch owned MySpace does not).
The problem isn't with the model, but the way in which many media moguls of the past run it. As I wrote previously in How Great Media Companies Fail on the Internet, traditional media companies will need to change the way they operate their companies if they are to be successful in the new, digital world. (Hint: overpaying for digital properties and running them into the ground is not a recipe for success).
There is no doubt that Digital Media poses a great challenge to incumbent media companies. As Murdoch themselves said in the same piece, “Some newspapers and news organizations will not adapt to the digital realities of our day—and they will fail.”
So, Rupert, take your own advice: Stop whining and start adapting.
(btw. Thanks for The Simpsons.)

It was like a real-life scene from Blade Runner, well, except for the pleasure-model skin jobs, the handguns that sound like laser blasters and the whole Harrison Ford thing. An NYC couple stumbles upon a digital camera left in a cab on New Year's Eve, and decide to turn all sleuthy.
They pore over the 300 photos and videos in the memory card—which probably wasn't exactly legal—landing upon a shot of a bunch of people drunk in a bar, wearing nametags. Though the names themselves seemed to lead nowhere, a couple clicks up and to the right, a little zoom and voila! Our heroes could see the bar's name, written on an awning.

Popping over there, they shook down the bartender for information. The bartender remembered a party and a particular "big tipper" who, fortunately for the couple, worked at another bar. They met up with her, and it turned out that their sister was amigos with the Australian who lost the camera. (What kind of amigo, I guess we'll never know.) After a few e-mails, the camera is making its way back to the bloke in Australia, who is happy to "know there are some honest people left in the world." [SMH]

Open letter to Tony Abbott
Dear Mr Abbott,
Coal is not god for humanity and other living things.
As this article points out humans are causing the greatest mass extinctions of life on earth and biodiversity destruction since the ice age.
Your assertions that coal is good for humanity has an underlying falsity which, you as a rational human being and a Christian must realise is patently a lie.
As a fellow Catholic I like you was taught not to lie for fear of eternal damnation and displeasing God.
Mr Abbott if you are sincere in your faith as a Christian you will retract this silly statement and divest yourself from the toxic influence of the coal lobby and start listening to reason.
You are the prime minister of the entire nation not just a spokesperson for big coal and other toxic industries which are all contributing to the demise of the creation of God.
To put it colloquially, Wake up Tony!

About a year and half ago, the CPAN community started to join Gratipay (formerly known as gittip), possibly under the influence of this post and that mashup.
Since then, laws and regulations have caught up with Gratipay, forcing them to radically change their model (there's something to be said about doing a little bit of bibliography/research on the problem area before diving into the code).
So if you joined Gratipay at that time, and received some tips, you should read this.
Gratipay is transitioning to a new model, dubbed Gratipay 2.0. The biggest change is that only teams can receive gifts. Mojolicious was the first Perl project to submit a team and to be accepted. They really always are on the bleeding edge!
Because none of my CPAN modules qualifies as a big project, I've created the CPAN-BOOK team on Gratipay, as a target for those who want to use money as a token of gratitude for my CPAN work. This is very likely to be a one-person team (although there's at least one person I'd like to invite to this team, as he's been consistently helping me with most of my modules).
After some discussion, Gratipay accepted my team submission.
I've also created two other teams for my bigger non-CPAN projects: CPAN.io for the http://cpan.io/ web site and Act for the Act project. I plan to invite project contributors to those teams, as soon as owners can actually edit their teams.
David Ranta once worked as a printer, though they are not certain that such jobs exist anymore.
Mr. Ranta, 58, has spent the last 23 years living in maximum security prisons for a crime they almost certainly did not commit. They will be released from a state prison west of Buffalo on Thursday and flown to New York City, where a State Supreme Court judge will most likely declare them a free man.
Mr. Ranta was convicted in 1991 of shooting a Hasidic rabbi, Chaskel Werzberger, in the head following the botched robbery of a jewelry courier. They twice appealed their conviction, and each time prosecutors working for the office of the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, convinced the courts to rule against Mr. Ranta.
No longer. After a yearlong investigation by the Conviction Integrity Unit of the district attorney's office, the prosecutors have joined Mr. Ranta's lawyer, Pierre Sussman, in asking the court to release the prisoner “in the interest of justice.” Prosecutors say new evidence creates “a probability that the verdict” in a trial would favor Mr. Ranta.
Specifically, a witness, Menachem Lieberman, as a 13-year-old, testified back then that they had seen Mr. Ranta sitting in a car near the murder site. But Mr. Lieberman, who now lives in Montreal, said they had been haunted for years by their action that day.
The ruling members objected and demanded an apology from the SP leader for their remarks. Agarwal later withdrew their comments and apologised. They had initially refused to apologize to the "contractors of the Hindu religion".His remarks were also expunged.Agarwal was speaking during the debate in the House on lynchings in the name of cow and narrated an incident in 1991 when they visited a school that was turned into a jail.He said the names of some Hindu deities linked to some types of alcohol were written on the wall of the school.Pointing towards the treasury bench, Agarwal said these lines were written by "your people".BJP members, including Ministers, demanded an apology from the Samajwadi member, shouting that they won't let anyone "insult Hindu Gods".Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar said Agarwal has hurt the sentiments of the majority population of the country."He has hurt not a single person but the whole community," Ananth Kumar said.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said if Agarwal had made the derogatory comments outside the House they would be liable to be prosecuted.Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien said Agarwal should not have made these remarks which "per se are derogatory" and should withdraw them. They ordered that the statement should be expunged from the records of the House.The Samajwadi leader later said if their remarks had hurt the sentiment of anyone they were withdrawing them.But the BJP members refused to budge and continued slogan shouting.Amid the din, Kurien twice adjourned the House and urged the media not to report the expunged comments.(With IANS inputs)
APPLE HAS ANNOUNCED that it will expand its Cork campus and make room for 1,000 additional employees by 2017.
The US tech giant is set to expand its campus in Hollyhill, Co Cork and add a new building that will provide new office space and room for 1,000 additional employees by mid-2017.
The company's CEO Tim Cook was in Ireland for the announcement.  They are to receive the gold medal of honorary patronage today from Trinity College Dublin's University Philosophical Society.

Employment
Apple opened its Cork facility in 1980. It is estimated that Apple supports nearly 18,000 jobs across the country, including over 5,000 direct Apple employees.
An Taoiseach Enda Kenny TD said of the news:
Apple's plans for new facilities at their Cork campus that can house a further 1,000 jobs is a very welcome boost of confidence in Cork and the South West region. It is also a welcome sign of broadening regional recovery. These new jobs come on top of 1,000 additional jobs already created at Apple in the past 12 months, which brought the workforce in Ireland to over 5,000 in 2015.
They said the continued expansion by the company “is testament to the quality of the talent pool, the infrastructure and the business environment that this country has to offer and further cements Apple as one of the leading employers in Ireland”.
Tánaiste Joan Burton TD described the news as “a profound statement of confidence in Ireland's economic recovery, and a profound statement of belief in the talent and creativity of the Irish workforce”.
Minister for Jobs, Enterprise & Innovation Richard Bruton TD described Apple as an iconic global brand.
“Through our Action Plan for Jobs we have been determined to support more employment in companies like Apple, through measures like extra IDA staff in overseas markets and increased numbers of trade missions, and we have seen major employment growth over recent years,” they said.
They described the announcement as “a huge boost for Cork and for all of Ireland”.
Martin Shanahan, CEO of IDA Ireland said that for any company to be located at the same campus for over 30 years “is a remarkable thing”.
The scale of the operation in Hollyhill is vast, with manufacturing, supply chain, AppleCare and shared services operations taking place within one campus. Today's news follows an announcement by Apple in February of this year where they revealed plans to put an €850 million data centre in Athenry.
ICT Ireland, the Ibec group that represents the high-tech sector, said the creation of 1,000 new jobs by Apple “highlights Ireland's continued attractiveness for major investment by tech companies”.
Apple has also announced that it is partnering with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to support research in offshore energy technology and is establishing a €1M Ocean Energy Industry Fund.
This is to support new ways of capturing wave energy and converting it to renewable electricity. Apple has pledged to power all its facilities with renewable energy.
Minister Alex White welcomed Apple's support for innovation in ocean energy, saying:
LONDON -- Diego Costa has been excused from the start of Chelsea's preseason training for a "few days," the club said.
Chelsea players return to Cobham to begin their preparations for the new season on Monday, but Costa is not among them as talks continue over a return to Atletico Madrid.
Sources told ESPN FC earlier on Monday that the striker had permission to miss training, and a report on Chelsea's website that night read: "Another absentee was Diego Costa, after it was agreed with the club that they should have an extra few days off."
A source at Chelsea insisted that Costa's absence is not intended to cast doubt on their professionalism but to avoid the added attention that would accompany their presence. No timeframe has been set for them to join up with the rest of the squad.
Costa has made no secret of their desire to return to the Spanish capital and an agreement is expected to be reached before the end of the transfer window, despite Atletico's ban on registering new players and the two clubs remaining far apart in their valuations of the 28-year-old.
The decision to excuse Costa spares Antonio Conte an awkward reunion, after the Chelsea head coach informed the striker that they were not wanted at Stamford Bridge by text message earlier this summer.
Chelsea are actively pursuing a replacement for Costa in the transfer market, but suffered a significant blow this week when rivals Manchester United beat them to the £75 million signing of top target Romelu Lukaku from Everton.
Real Madrid's Alvaro Morata and Torino's Andrea Belotti both feature on Conte's wish list, but Chelsea are not close to either deal.
Meanwhile, Chelsea also confirmed that new signing Antonio Rudiger has been granted an extended break after representing Germany at the Confederations Cup.

Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement The upper house of India's parliament has approved a bill to reserve a third of all seats in the national parliament and state legislatures for women. The bill was passed with 186 members of the 245-seat house voting in favour. Only one member voted against. Several smaller parties boycotted the vote. The bill's introduction on Monday led to uproar from opponents, resulting in the suspension of seven MPs on Tuesday. First proposed in 1996, the bill now has support from India's main parties. ANALYSIS By Soutik Biswas
BBC News, Delhi
This is one affirmative action which large parts of India do support. India does have some measures to support its women, but in a largely patriarchal society they have borne the brunt of neglect and discrimination. Acts such as female foeticide leading to skewed sex ratios in some of the most prosperous states are abominable. Things are changing, but the way India sometimes treats its women is a national shame. Also, with just 10% of its parliamentary seats held by women, India needs to play catch-up. Its neighbours fare much better - Bangladesh reserves 15% of its parliamentary seats for women, Pakistan 30% and Afghanistan, after its new constitution, more than 27%. Biswas: Victory for women At present women make up just 10% of the lower house of parliament (Lok Sabha), and significantly fewer in state assemblies. Sonia Gandhi, Congress party president, has said they attach the "highest importance" to the proposals and passing them would be a "gift to the women of India". The bill needed the support of two-thirds of voters present in the upper house (Rajya Sabha) for it to be passed. It will be tabled in the lower house at a later date. An overwhelming majority there support the move, correspondents say. The bill has the support of the governing Congress-led UPA alliance, the BJP-led NDA alliance and left-wing parties. Many believe it will help overcome gender inequality in India and lead to decisions that help improve the lives of millions of women. 'Giant step' Party leaders hailed the approval of the historic bill, which they had hoped would be passed on Monday, International Women's Day.
'A new liberation for Indian women' Voices: Quotas for India's women "The bill is a historic and giant step towards empowering women and a celebration of their rights," Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in the Rajya Sabha. "Women are facing discrimination at home, there is domestic violence, unequal access to health and education. This has to end," they said. Communist leader Brinda Karat said it would change the "culture of the country because women today are still caught in a culture prison". "In the name of tradition, stereotypes are imposed and we have to fight these every day," they said. The Congress party's Jayanthi Natarajan said "women have been waiting for 62 years for this moment". The bill's passage through the upper house was marked by scenes of chaos after it was tabled on Monday. FROM GLOBAL VOICES Such a policy is likely to increase the pool of talent needed at the top of our political class
Dweep at Desicritics [This is] not going to lead to the empowerment of ordinary Indian women... all that it is going to do is to make political gharanas (dynasties) even more powerful
Vinod Sharma, India Retold
Read more views on Global Voices What is this? Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Arun Jaitley, speaking in parliament on Tuesday, said the uproar was "one of the most shameful moments in India's parliamentary democracy". Earlier, seven MPs had been forcibly removed from the upper house by security guards, after they refused to leave having been suspended for disorderly behaviour. The MPs had shouted slogans, snatched papers from Vice President Hamid Ansari's table, torn them and thrown them at him. The MPs are all members of three parties opposing the women's bill: the Samajwadi Party (SP), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Lok Janshakti Party (LJP). While India's main parties back the legislation, smaller socialist parties argue it will reduce representation of minorities and socially disadvantaged groups. They want to set quotas for women from Muslim and low-caste communities. There are currently 59 women in the 545-member Lok Sabha. Under the proposals their numbers would rise to 181. The composition of the 245-seat upper house, which at present has 21 women, will not be affected as its members are indirectly elected by state assemblies. India already reserves a third of local governing council seats in towns and villages for women, a move that has significantly increased their role in decision-making.

Is this teenage Mongolian girl one of the last eagle hunters — or the first of a new breed?
Updated
In the remote mountains of north-western Mongolia, a teenage girl is their family's sole hope of keeping an ancient tradition alive.
Akbota Baitilkarib, 14, petite and shy, is training to become a golden eagle hunter.
With perhaps as few as 60 authentic eagle hunters left, it's feared the tradition could die out within a generation. So Akbota is taking on a weighty responsibility in trying to save it.
In their conservative community, where most girls marry young and stick to child-rearing and household chores, Akbota is breaking boundaries.
"Of course girls can do anything the boys do," they tell Foreign Correspondent.
"We're resilient, and if you never give up, you can do anything."
Them parents are backing them all the way.
"The idea that women can only do domestic chores is ancient," their schoolteacher mother Takhau Oser says.
"In today's world, girls need to be hardy and be competitive with boys — that's why I don't agree with that old thinking."
Akbota takes some inspiration from another teenage girl hunter, Aisholpan — star of the international hit documentary The Eagle Huntress.
But Akbota has been training for three years and following hunts for six — long before the movie shot Aisholpan to fame.
Akbota's three older brothers have all gone to the distant city for education and work. So it's up to them to assume the mantle of their eagle hunter dad Orken.
When Foreign Correspondent films Akbota at training, their eagle looks almost as big as them It weighs close to eight kilograms, and sometimes they struggle with it.
But in a couple of years Orken expects they can be a fully-fledged hunter, taking their golden eagle high into wintry mountains to bring down foxes, marmots and rabbits.
"She is making good progress so that makes me proud. And I'm happy for them because they love this very much," they say.
"I want to encourage girls like Akbota and Aishalpan. They're going the right way."
Introducing hunting culture to world
The girls face resistance from old-timers like Khabyl Khakh — a weather-beaten veteran of 50 years of winter hunts in isolated steppes and valleys.
"There have never been any eagle huntresses," they say.
"In the past, women didn't go up the mountain. They got married and moved away. Being an eagle huntress is just a passing thing."
The eagle hunters are Kazakhs. Many are nomads. They are clinging to their hunting culture in this corner of Mongolia; in neighbouring Kazakhstan the tradition was lost under Soviet rule.
Older hunters fear their tradition is doomed. But there are youngsters, male and female, who are fighting to keep it alive.
"My plan is to teach coming generations about how to train hunting eagles," Akbota says.
"I also want to introduce our hunting culture to the world.
"If I'm brave and determined, I'll keep doing this — after all, this is a Kazakh national treasure. I want to do my part and teach others to let it live on."
The Last Eagle Hunters airs on Foreign Correspondent at 9.30pm on ABC TV.

Why I'm Leaving Ubuntu for Debian
I decided to switch to Debian.
I've been using Ubuntu as my primary operating system since 2005. Back then it was truly amazing. Before I started using Ubuntu I tried out Red Hat, Mandrake (and later Mandriva), Slackware, Gentoo, and even Debian. In all of them, something didn't work. Usually it was wifi, but sometimes it was audio or video, or weird X config problems. But when I switched to Ubuntu, all of that went away. Rather than being frusturated that I was still a Linux noob and couldn't even connect to the internet, Ubuntu helped me get past the initial barriers so I could really dive in. I'm eternally grateful to Ubuntu for this, and I'm very impressed at how successful they've has been at fixing bug #1 (though there's still a long way to go).
However, a lot of Ubuntu's recent decisions have been turning me off. It started a couple years ago when they changed the default desktop environment from GNOME to Unity. I had played with Unity when it was called “Ubuntu Netbook Remix” and I thought it was a fun toy, and might be easier to use on a touchscreen device than GNOME. But they made it the default before it was ready. Still, I saw where they were going with it and respected them for being so ambitious.
Another thing that started to annoy me was Ubuntu One, their cloud service. I could immediately see that if I were to use and rely on Ubuntu One, I would be locked in. It would be like needing iCloud or something, and I didn't like that idea. I was also noticing that my OS was starting to want me to buy stuff. Cloud storage space, music from the Ubuntu One music store straight from rhythmbox. It didn't bother me all that much, but it was definitely a new direction for my OS that I wasn't a huge fan of.
Around the same time came the Ubuntu Software Center. At first I was impressed. They managed to make something way more usable than Synaptic Package Manager for finding programs to install. It wasn't always clear which packages were programs themselves or just dependencies of other programs, but Ubuntu added ratings, reviews, screenshots, and a nicer interface. But then they started integrating the Ubuntu Software Center with Ubuntu One. Then they started selling proprietary software through it. Then they started calling programs “apps”, and featuring them with big graphical banners. I don't know how they decide what programs to feature, but whenever I open it, it always seems to feature a proprietary video game that costs money.
I talked to my friend and colleague Seth Schoen about the Ubuntu Software Center selling proprietary software, and they pointed out that it goes directly against the Ubuntu Manifesto. I looked it up and read it, and it sure seemed that way to me. Only now I can't seem to find a copy of it. The only reference to the manifesto that I can find on ubuntu.com is in some documentation on an old release:
The Ubuntu community is built on the ideas enshrined in the Ubuntu Manifesto: that software should be available free of charge, that software tools should be usable by people in their local language and despite any disabilities, and that people should have the freedom to customize and alter their software in whatever way they see fit.
Even then, I still was relatively happy with Ubuntu. Then they started adding online search lenses to Unity's dash, specifically one that automatically searched Amazon for products to buy each time you try to open a program, and the Ubuntu community exploded in controversy.
People were offended that their free software operating system was suddently advertising to them all the time and that their search terms were getting sent to a handful of third parties. I blogged about this on EFF's website and included a (in my opinion) completely reasonable list of requests. The most important one, with the aim of protecting the privacy of all Ubuntu users that might not dig into their settings, “Disable ‘Include online search results' by default”, was the one that they most staunchly refused to budge on.
After watching Canonical's announcement about the Ubuntu phone, I think I understand why. Ubuntu is pulling an Apple. They want to merge the desktop, tablet, and phone, and they want them all to have a familiar and user friendly interface. Only, sadly, Ubuntu's interface includes sending your search terms to an undefined list of companies, every time, without the option to opt-in. Privacy is clearly not on the top of their priority list. I was looking forward to the prospect of truly open phone, but I can't trust Ubuntu to protect my privacy anymore. Now my hopes lie in Firefox OS.
Now I'm typing this blog post on my freshly installed Debian laptop. Debian also has documents like the Ubuntu Manifesto (Debian Social Contract and Free Software Guidelines), but I doubt they'll ever disappear from debian.org.
One of the things that's prevented me from switching to Debian in the past is that all of the software in the stable repositories is old (one of the reasons it's so stable). After talking to some Debian-using friends and asking in #debian on irc.oftc.net, I decided to use the testing repositories instead, which is closer to Ubuntu's set of software anyway.
Debian is still a bit rough around the edges compared to Ubuntu. My laptop requires a proprietary wifi driver that wasn't present in the netinst cd, but I got it working without too much trouble anyway. I'm running Iceweasel 10.0.12, but Firefox is at 18.0.1 now and I have to do some work to get the latest version. I'm sure I'll run into other issues too, issues that don't exist when you use Ubuntu.
But it's totally worth it, because now I'm using an operating system that I feel that I can trust again.
Update: It looks like the Ubuntu Manifesto (I assume it's the original, but I'm not sure) is on ubuntu.com. It's not labeled as the Ubuntu Manifesto, and is on a page called Our Philosophy.
Update to the update: A commenter informed me that, “With the end of the 10.04 LTS support Canonical will silently remove the last traces of its former Manifesto that remained in the LTS documentation. The new marketing take concerning the ‘free of charge' topic can be found on http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/: ‘… available free of charge … funded through a portfolio of services provided by Canonical.'”
Catholic priest (Shuttershock)
A Catholic priest who was accused of sexually abusing a 16-year-old girl has been appointed as director of a teen pregnancy center, prompting activists to call for them to be removed from the post.
The Detroit Free Press reported on Monday that Rev. Kenneth Kaucheck was named director of the Gianna House Pregnancy and Parenting Residence in Eastpointe.
According to the paper, “the center takes in teenagers and young women who are pregnant, assisting them and any children they might later have.”
The report said that Kaucheck was removed from two churches after the Archdiocese of Detroit determined in 2009 that they had sexually abused a 16-year-old girl who they were counseling in the 1970s.
At the time, prosecutors declined to file charges against Kaucheck, arguing that the girl was old enough to legally consent.
On its website, the Gianna House says that Kaucheck was chosen as director to “provide a wide range of ideas and skills.”
But David Clohessy of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) said that it was “inexcusable” to hire “a priest who was ousted because they molested a girl now works for a nonprofit that reportedly helps girls.”
“It's inexcusable for any nonprofit to hire a credibly accused child molesting cleric,” Clohessy explained. “A simple Google search would have shown that Fr. Ken is potentially dangerous and should never be given any position or title that confers respect, much fewer gives them access to vulnerable people.”
Archdiocese of Detroit Director Joe Kohn told the Free Press that Kaucheck could be removed from their position under Canon law.
Kohn said that the “position at Gianna House violates the restrictions placed on their ministry in 2009.”
“We assert that they should not be allowed to continue in this position,” Kohn insisted.
A jury finds Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof guilty of federal hate crimes resulting in the death of nine black parishioners at a historic church in South Carolina last year. (Reuters)
CHARLESTON, S.C. — After nearly a week of painful testimony that vividly re-created the massacre at this city's famed Mother Emanuel church, it took jurors about two hours Thursday to convict Dylann Roof in their federal hate crimes trial.
Roof was charged with 33 counts in their federal indictment. They were found guilty on every single one. Family members of the nine parishioners gunned down last year nodded silently as each charge was read aloud. Some held hands, their eyes shut tightly, as each guilty verdict was announced in the courtroom just a mile from the church.
With Roof's guilt effectively unquestioned, this verdict was seen as likely, and the trial largely hinged on what happens next. Mirroring what happened during the Boston Marathon bombing trial last year — the last case that saw the Justice Department obtain a rare federal death sentence — there was no real question about guilt. Prosecutors played video footage of Roof admitting their guilt to FBI agents, and Roof's attorneys did not argue that they were innocent.
Instead, the larger question surrounding the trial has focused on the next portion of the case, which will deal with whether Roof is sentenced to death or life in prison.
This sentencing phase is set to begin next month, and it remains far less clear what will happen there, as Roof said Thursday they still intend to represent himself. Federal death sentences are rare, but the government has opted to seek one in this case, even though this decision has caused some unease among relatives of the victims. It is also unclear when and if the government would be able to carry out such a sentence.
U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel on Thursday dismissed the jurors until the next phase of the trial begins on Jan. 3.
[‘Evil, evil, evil as can be': Emotional testimony as Dylann Roof trial begins]
Federal prosecutors had used their emotional closing arguments earlier Thursday to paint a picture of Roof, the 22-year-old who confessed to the shootings, as cruel and calculated. Earlier on Thursday, they read lines from a journal found in their car and the manifesto they posted online, and they told jurors that Roof wanted to incite a race war.
After being welcomed into Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church's bible study in June 2015, Roof sat among the parishioners and then “executed them because they believe they are nothing but animals,” Nathan Williams, an assistant U.S. attorney, told jurors.
Sanders asked how they think Rev. Pinckney would feel after #RoofTrial verdict: "He would feel the same way all of us feel, 'yes, yes.'" — Caitlin Byrd (@MaryCaitlinByrd) December 15, 2016
While Williams spoke, a photograph of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney was shown on the screen. The pastor, who had offered Roof a seat next to him, was wearing a crisp white shirt and new suit in the image. Both were stained by blood pooling around Pinckney, who had been shot five times in the neck, back and arm. Roof's grandmother, sitting in the courtroom while the image was displayed, wiped a tear from them eye.
[Remembering the Charleston church shooting victims]
Roof's attorney, David Bruck, said that the 22-year-old's actions were clearly senseless, but they described them as the actions of someone unable to perceive the world as it is.
“Why did Roof do this? Why was they motivated?” Bruck said, calling on the jury to try their best to consider who Roof is and what led them to commit such a violent act. They called Roof an immature young man who gave themselves over to the “mad idea that they can make things better by executing those kind, virtuous people.”
For Bruck, a widely recognized death-penalty lawyer, their closing arguments Thursday represented perhaps their last chance to address the jurors. Gergel agreed to let Roof represent themselves during the penalty portion of the trial, though Bruck and their other attorneys will remain as standby counsel to assist him. After they were convicted, Roof reiterated their desire to represent himself.
[What happens next if Dylann Roof is sentenced to death]
While prosecutors will outline the aggravating factors that they believe warrant a death sentence, it is unclear what Roof will do in their own defense. Bruck had previously indicated in a court filing that they would raise the issue of Roof's mental health, which could be a mitigating factor to avoid a death sentence.
Roof had previously offered to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence, but federal authorities are still pursuing a death sentence.  They are also facing a potential death sentence in a state trial, set to begin next year, on charges of murder and attempted murder.
It is my hope that the survivors, the families & the people of South Carolina can find some peace in the fact that justice has been served. — Nikki Haley (@nikkihaley) December 15, 2016
Authorities said that in their FBI interview and manifestos, Roof had said they “had to do it” because they believed nobody was putting a stop to what they had read online about “black-on-white crime.” Roof believed that it was “not too late to take the country back from blacks,” prosecutors said during the trial.

During the closing arguments Thursday, Roof, wearing a dull blue cable-knit sweater and dark gray pants, did not look up while Williams recited details of the case.
“A church is a sanctuary, a place of worship, a place of safety,” Williams told the jurors. Roof shattered that peace, Williams said, with a carefully plotted attack, visiting the church numerous times before the shooting.
Prosecutors had previously said that they believed Roof self-radicalized online, drawing bigoted beliefs from the Internet rather than any personal experiences. They had also said that Roof had two handwritten manifestos along with a list of churches. Williams said Thursday that this was a group of predominantly black churches, and “the one that they chose was at the top of their list.”
[‘We are just looking for justice': Charleston prepares for Dylann Roof's trial]
“A person's actions tell us what they are thinking and what is in their heart,” Williams said as photos of Roof's victims were shown in the court.
Each victim was shown gunned down on the floor of the church's basement, depicted as they were at the time of their deaths. Above each graphic photo was a portrait of the victims as they were during their lives.
Huddled together under blankets in the chilly courtroom, the families of the victims began weeping. Some kept their heads bowed, rocking back and forth, while others held their heads high, refusing to look away.
One relative groaned and rushed from the courtroom as an image of Tywanza Sanders was shown, their arm outstretched toward Susie Jackson as they lay dead on the church floor. Jackson, the oldest victim at 87 years old, was shot at least 10 times, the most of any victim.
“There is no bravery in this defendant. There is no bravery in their actions. But there is bravery in this case,” Williams told the jury before recounting the courage shown by the victims at the time of the shooting and the survivors who took to the witness stand to recount the massacre.
While Williams spoke, Bruck sat low in their chair, their head rested wearily on their fist. They began by apologizing for their soft-spoken nature, asking jurors to give them a signal if their voice dips too low, before asking the jury to try their best to consider who Roof is and what led them to commit such a violent act.

Bruck pointed out that Roof had no long-range plan following the shooting. During a two-hour videotaped confession, Roof told FBI agents that they had saved ammunition to shoot themselves once they encountered the police. In Roof's car, investigators found handwritten notes to their parents, apologizing to their mother and father for what they had done and saying they loved them.
During their statements, Bruck made final attempts to introduce doubt regarding Roof's mental competence, noting that Roof was unable to recall how many victims they had shot or the duration of the shooting during their confession.
“The fact that one is a racist does not tell you what else is going on,” Bruck said. “And what else is going on is what you should be thinking about.”
Roof was charged last year with hate crimes resulting in death, hate crimes involving attempts to kill, using a firearm during a crime of violence and with obstructing the exercise of religion resulting in death and attempts to kill people.
It took the jury in the Boston Marathon bombing's case about 11 hours to deliberate before finding Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on all 30 counts last year. Jurors in Charleston, deliberating on Thursday, needed about two hours to convict Roof on all counts.

A year later, families of the Charleston shooting victims still wrestle with forgiveness.
Brian Myerson said they had been hit by the effects of the economic downturn A City tycoon hit by the recession has failed in court to cut an £11m divorce settlement with their former wife. Brian Myerson, 50, agreed the deal from £25.8m of assets, including shares in their company, last year. Mr Myerson told the Court of Appeal the value of the shares had dropped so much that instead of receiving £14.6m, they were half-a-million out of pocket. But three appeal judges ruled that "natural price fluctuation" did not justify a change in the settlement. Cash settlement After the ruling, the tycoon's spokesperson said: "Mr Myerson is disappointed that the court failed to recognise that the economic downturn had rendered their divorce settlement unfair. "The aim of Mr Myerson's appeal has always been to ensure that the division of assets with their ex-wife was equitable and they will now take their appeal to the House of Lords. "A separate consequence of this appeal is that in July the High Court will hear a freestanding application to cancel the further payments that are presently due to their ex-wife under the terms of the existing settlement. That hearing will be in private." The couple married in December 1982 and have two sons and a daughter. Under the divorce settlement reached in Match last year, Mr Myerson's sculptor ex-wife, who lives in Hampstead, north London, will be paid a total of £9.5m over four years. They also received a £1.5m property in South Africa. 'Unforeseen forces' It was agreed that they should get a cash settlement and they would keep all the shares in their company, Principle Capital Investment Trust, which has offices around the world. The court was told the value of each of the shares had fallen from £3 to 27.5 pence since the settlement. Martin Pointer QC, representing Mr Myerson, told the judges: "The husband's case is that the unforeseeable and unforeseen combination of forces at play within the global economy has undermined the assumptions upon which the order was made." Mr Pointer said the wife's share of the total assets under the order would be 105% and the husband's would be minus 5%. "Arguably it could be worse than that," they added. Giving the court's ruling, Lord Justice Thorpe said: "When a business person takes a speculative position in compromising their wife's claims, why should the court subsequently relieve them of the consequences of their speculation by rewriting the bargain at their behest?"

BILL Shorten is severing century-old ALP ties with the union movement in a parcel of changes they will today insist are needed for Labor to regain government.
The Opposition Leader will declare themselves “a proud union member” but will reveal they have directed ALP national secretary George Wright to eliminate rules making a union ticket compulsory for Labor membership.
“This change makes it plain that in 2014 Labor is not the political arm of anything but the Australian people,” Mr Shorten plans to say in a speech today.
They will criticise the power of unions over the party: “ ... The role of unions within our party has developed into a factional, centralised decision-making role.
“If we are to renew and rebuild the Labor Party, we must rebuild as a membership-based party, not a faction-based one.”
They will also outline a more gradual reshaping of Labor rules to give rank-and-file members greater involvement in preselections, and will set the scene for a major debate over Labor's platform at the 2015 national conference.
Mr Shorten will stake their personal authority on pushing through the changes and claim they have a mandate as the first member-elected party leader.
They had intended to deliver the speech on April 7 but it was postponed after the sudden death of their mother Ann. That postponement has not altered the urgency they place on reforms.
Party sources have told news.com.au their aim is not to tidy up Labor's rules for neatness' sake but to make drastic changes they believe necessary for electoral success.
“So today is a day for facing up to some hard truths,” they are expected to tell the Wheeler Centre in Melbourne this afternoon.
“Friends, Tony Abbott did not put Labor in Opposition — the Australian people put us here.
And unless we change, it is where we will stay.
“Unless we change, we will be forced to watch on as the Liberals undo and unmake everything that modern Australia is, everything that modern Australia can be.”
Mr Shorten wants:
* Greater community involvement in selecting candidates with further limits on the party executive to impose choices. They will refer to the debacle in Western Australia in which the top Senate candidate was a former union official who had admitted they didn't always vote Labor.
* A “membership based party” of 100,000 members; A “one-click online joining model for new members” to replace the current cumbersome application system by June; “Low cost, uniform national membership fees” to attract young people, people on low incomes, students, apprentices and trainees; Make the ALP national conference more representative of community groups.
The most controversial change will be the cutting of 113 years of compulsory links between party and trade union membership. Mr Shorten believes it is a symbolic tie but union colleagues of the former AWU secretary are certain to disagree.
“As a party we can't remain anchored in the past — we need to rise with the modern tide,” Mr Shorten will say.
“I believe it should no longer be compulsory for prospective members of the Labor Party to join a union ...
“People have said that this a symbolic change — it is. And it is more than that. It is a change that makes it clear that Labor is not exclusively for one group of Australians.
“We are for an economy where everyone prospers, a society where everyone benefits, an Australia where the fair go is for everyone. Union and non-union employees. The self-employed, small business and wage earners.”
Mr Shorten will condemn the royal commission into unions ordered by Prime Minister Tony Abbott as politically motivated and the “low use of high office”, but will warn anyone found to have acted corruptly would not receive Labor's help.
“Corruption is a profound insult and a deep betrayal of everything the Labor Party and the union movement stand for,” they will say.

The U.S. stock market is more overvalued than it was at the majority of the past century's peaks, according to six well-known valuation ratios.
That doesn't mean the bull market is coming to an end, of course, since some past bull markets were even more overvalued when they topped out. Furthermore, no two market peaks behave the same way.
Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that risks are high. You may want to consider selling some of your stock holdings and building up cash.
To compare current valuations to those that prevailed at past market tops, I relied on a comprehensive list of past bull-market tops compiled by Ned Davis Research. The list is based on a set of criteria focusing on the speed, magnitude and length of market movements.
According to the firm, there have been 35 bull-market tops since 1900. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost an average of 31% in the bear markets that followed.
Here's how the market stacks up to past market tops according to these six valuation ratios.
Price/earnings ratio. Calculated by dividing stock price by earnings per share, this is perhaps the most widely followed of all valuation ratios. Based on the previous 12 months' earnings, the S&P 500's current P/E ratio is 18.6, which is higher than those that prevailed at 24 of the 35 bull market tops since 1900. (Data before 1957 are for the S&P Composite Stock Index, since the S&P 500 didn't exist yet.)

(Data before 1957 are for the S&P Composite Stock Index, since the S&P 500 didn't exist yet.) Cyclically adjusted P/E ratio. This is the version of the P/E championed by Yale University Professor Robert Shiller, the recent Nobel laureate in economics. It is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by the average of its inflation-adjusted earnings of the preceding decade. For the S&P 500, this ratio currently stands at 25.6, which is higher than what prevailed at 29 of the 35 tops since 1900.

For the S&P 500, this ratio currently stands at 25.6, which is higher than what prevailed at 29 of the 35 tops since 1900. Dividend yield. This is the percentage of a company's stock price that is represented by its total annual dividends. Since this yield tends to fall as prices rise, and vice versa, the market should register some of its lowest readings near its tops. The S&P 500's yield currently stands at 2.0%, which is lower than the comparable yields that prevailed at all but five of the bull-market tops since 1900.

This is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by its per-share sales. Though it is lesser known, it still is championed by many investors because it is based on data that are less susceptible to manipulation than earnings. For the S&P 500, the price/sales ratio currently stands at 1.6, which is higher than the comparable readings that prevailed at all but two of the bull market tops since 1955, which is how far back data are available.

Price/book ratio. This is another lesser-known valuation indicator, calculated by dividing a company's stock price by its per-share book value—an accounting measure of net worth. For the S&P 500, this ratio currently stands at 2.7, which is higher than all but five of the 28 bull-market tops since the mid-1920s, which is how far back data are available.

For the S&P 500, this ratio currently stands at 2.7, which is higher than all but five of the 28 bull-market tops since the mid-1920s, which is how far back data are available. “Q” ratio. This indicator is based on research conducted by the late James Tobin, the 1981 Nobel laureate in economics. It is similar to the price/book ratio, except that book value is substituted by the replacement cost of assets.
Mr. Tobin thought this to be superior since they considered replacement cost to be better reflection of a company's net worth than book value, which is based on assets' original cost — no matter how far in the past those assets were acquired.
The Q ratio currently is higher than what prevailed at 31 of the 35 past market tops, according to data compiled by Stephen Wright, an economics professor at the University of London, and Andrew Smithers, founder of the U.K.-based economics-consulting firm Smithers & Co.
While each of these valuation ratios has its detractors, it is noteworthy that all six of them are currently telling a similar story. It is also worth noting that a particularly bearish message is coming from the two that, according to Messrs. Smithers and Wright, have the best historical track record — the Q ratio and the Shiller P/E.
If you agree with this bearish assessment, you should be thinking of ways to build up cash in your portfolio. At a minimum, you shouldn't automatically reinvest the proceeds when you sell any existing stock positions.
Market timing is notoriously difficult, however, so you might choose to stick with your stock positions through thick and thin. In that event, you could still begin to shift your stock holdings toward sectors that historically have performed the best near the end of a bull market.
According to Ned Davis Research, those sectors tend to be consumer discretionary and consumer staples. Two exchange-traded funds benchmarked to those sectors are the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR XLY, +0.14% and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR XLP, +0.06% They both charge annual fees of 0.18%, or $18 per $10,000 invested.
Here are the stocks in these two sectors that are most popular right now among the advisers tracked by the Hulbert Financial Digest who have beaten the stock market over the past 15 years: satellite-television provider DirecTV DTV, -0.72% ; entertainment giant Walt Disney DIS, -0.08% ; Kimberly-Clark KMB, -0.01% the consumer-products company; fast-food giant McDonald's MCD, +0.33% ; drug distributor McKesson MCK, -2.33% ; PepsiCo PEP, -0.08% the beverage company; and Philip Morris International PM, -0.10% the cigarette manufacturer.

My co-founders and I created and launched Take Eat Easy in the summer of 2012. Our objective was to enable quality restaurants to provide a reliable delivery service to their customers. About a year later, after having tested and proven the concept in Brussels, we expanded to Paris, raised a first round of VC funding in April 2015, and a second one in August 2015.
Over the last 12 months, we increased the size of the team from 10 to 160, scaled our operations from 2 to 20 cities, developed our restaurant partnerships from 450 to 3,200, and ultimately grew our customer base from 30,000 to 350,000.
About 1/3 of our customers become “active customers”, and once “hooked” order on average 1,5x/month. Actually, active customers order more and more frequently over time.
A couple of days ago we hit the 1 million order mark, yet today we are filing for judicial restructuring.
From 1,000,000 to ?
Why are we filing for judicial restructuring? The short answer is that 1) our revenue doesn't cover our costs yet, and that 2) we haven't been able to raise a third round of funding.
Our revenue doesn't cover our costs yet
Take Eat Easy's business model is fairly simple. On each order, we charge the restaurant a 25-30% commission, and a 2,5€ delivery fee to the customer. With this c. 10€ of net revenue / order, we then have to pay the bicycle courier.
Contribution Margin is thus a function of Restaurant Commission, Average Order Value, Delivery Fee and Delivery Cost.
The first three parameters are mostly dictated by market conditions. Delivery Cost, however, is a direct function of “Courier Utilisation”, the number of deliveries / courier / hour.
Courier utilisation is one of the most important metrics in our business. Assuming couriers need to make minimum 15€ / hour not to churn, a low courier utilisation (<1,5 deliveries / courier / hour) implies a negative contribution margin.
Our job is to align supply and demand in time and space, and over the last few months, we were getting pretty good at this. Our Tech & Ops teams focused their efforts on
Automatic optimisation and dispatching of orders to couriers and restaurants (based on learned average speed, position, prep time and ETAs)
Capacity planning based on internal and external factors (like marketing budget and weather)
Deep integration in restaurant operations through our partner app: cancel orders, deactivate dishes online, change prep time per order
Contribution Margin has been steadily improving and is now positive across the group, though not yet high enough to cover our fixed costs.
We haven't been able to raise a third round of funding
Despite the above, we haven't been able to raise additional capital to fuel the company until break-even.
We've started working on our Series C in October 2015. We knew we had to gear up as one of our own investor acquired and invested aggressively in a direct competitor, now Foodora, and Deliveroo had just raised a massive round of funding. Unfortunately for us, they raised and announced an even bigger round a couple of weeks later. That didn't help.
In March 2016, after having been rejected by 114 VC funds, we signed a term sheet with a French, state-owned, logistics group, for a 30m€ investment.
Unfortunately, after 3 months of intensive due diligence, their board rejected the deal and they ended up withdrawing their offer. We were negotiating with them under an exclusivity agreement, didn't have a plan B, and only had a couple of weeks of run-way left.
For the last 8 weeks, we've desperately tried to find solutions to keep the business alive. We've worked on both financing and acquisitions deals in parallel, unfortunately none of them materialised. We have now run out of time to keep operating business as usual, and are filing for judicial restructuring.
We have launched Take Eat Easy out of passion, for on demand-logistics, technology, great food and even greater service.
We have launched Take Eat Easy out of a genuine belief that we could make your life tastier.

MUMBAI: Punit Renjen , the chairperson of the board of Deloitte US, has been appointed as the new chief executive officer of Deloitte Global (Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu), the first India-born senior executive to head one of the Big Four consultancies."Thank you for the trust you have placed in me and you have my commitment to serve the global network. I will do my best to serve the global network….." Renjen wrote in an e-mail to all global directors and partners last Friday.Renjen will replace Barry Salzberg as the global CEO from June 1, when the firm's financial year starts. They got 98% of the 5,400 votes to become the global chief executive officer, according to a separate mail sent to all employees on Monday afternoon. Deloitte LLP , the US member firm, recorded $14.91 billion in revenue in the year ended May 31, 2014."Renjen comes from an information technology consulting background and they were part of the team that was crucial in Deloitte around 1999-2000 when the Y2K issue was on top of everyone's minds," said a senior partner in one of the boutique firms who earlier worked with Renjen in the US.Some were slightly apprehensive about Renjen's appointment. "I don't know if the global partners are prepared to take an outsider as their head," said the India head of one of the Big Four. "That is nonsense," said another national head of auditing with the Big Four. "In fact, I have seen increased respect for anyone who has grown from within the organisation and who doesn't belong to the 6-foot, Ivy League kind of definition. They have spent 28 years in the US and in Deloitte and I think we Indians are just happy with the reflected glory.  They are more American," they quipped.The Big Four refers to the largest global accounting firms, the others being Pricewaterhouse-Coopers, EY and KPMG.Renjen's father was a prominent business person in Lahore before the partition. The Renjen family moved to Rohtak in Haryana where their father started an electrical switchgear manufacturing unit. Renjen completed their schooling from Lawrence School in Himachal Pradesh and worked in Usha International in New Delhi after their graduation.
The CIS Tower is an office skyscraper on Miller Street in Manchester, England. It was completed in 1962 and rises to 387 feet (118 m) in height. The Grade II listed building, which houses the Co-operative Banking Group, is Manchester's third-tallest building and the tallest office building in the United Kingdom outside London. The tower remained as built for over 40 years until maintenance issues on the service tower required an extensive renovation which included covering its facade in photovoltaic panels.
Background [ edit ]
The mosaic-clad tower in 2002
The tower was designed as a prestige headquarters to showcase the Co-operative movement in Manchester.[1] In 1958 the company proposed building an office tower block, construction began the following year and was completed in 1962.[2] It was designed by Gordon Tait of Burnett, Tait & Partners and Co-operative's own architect, G. S. Hay. In the 1990s, it was granted Grade II listed building status by English Heritage. The tower, described as "the best of the Manchester 1960s office blocks",[3] was listed for its "discipline and consistency". It is part of a group with New Century House and its Conference Hall on Corporation Street.[4] The tower's design was influenced by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill's Inland Steel Building in Chicago after a visit by the architects in 1958.[1][5]
CIS Tower from Miller Street
In 1962, at 387 feet, the CIS Tower overtook the Shell Centre as the tallest building in the United Kingdom, a title it retained for a year until it was replaced by the Millbank Tower in London. In 2006 the Beetham Tower became the tallest building in Manchester.[6]
Architecture [ edit ]
The office tower building rises above a five-storey podium block. It has a steel frame and glass curtain walls with metal window frames. Black vitreous enamel panels demarcate the floor levels. The building materials, glass, enamelled steel and aluminium, were chosen so that the building could remain clean in the polluted Manchester atmosphere.[3] The tower's concrete service shaft, which rises above the office tower, has two bands of vents at the top and was clad in a mosaic made up of 14 million centimetre-square, grey tesserae[4] designed to shimmer and sparkle.[5] The projecting reinforced concrete service shaft houses lifts and emergency stairs.[7]
The ground floor is set back behind six pillars. A green bronze-like, abstract mural sculpted by William George Mitchell made from fibreglass covers the entrance hall's rear wall.[4] The building has 700,000 square feet of floor area with clear open spaces on the office floors.[7] Interiors were designed by Misha Black of the Design Research Unit. The executive areas are delineated by the use of teak and cherry wood veneers.[3]
Renovation [ edit ]
Within six months of construction some of the mosaic tiles on the service tower became detached owing to cement failure and lack of expansion joints in the concrete. Although the tower was granted listed building status in 1995, falling tiles were an ongoing problem. English Heritage had to be consulted as alterations could change the building's appearance.[8]
In 2004 CIS consulted Solarcentury with a view to replacing the deteriorating mosaic with 575.5 kW of blue building-integrated photovoltaic (PV) cells which would provide a permanent green energy solution, generating approximately 180,000 kWh (average of 20 kW) of electricity per year. The work was completed by Arup and at that time was the largest commercial solar façade in Europe. The PV cells made by Sharp Electronics[9] began feeding electricity to the National Grid in November 2005.[10][11] The project, which cost £5.5 million, was partly funded by the Northwest Regional Development Agency which granted £885,000 and the Energy Savings Trust at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) contributed £175,000.[10] The solar power project was chosen by the DTI as one of the "10 best green energy projects" of 2005.[12] Out of sight on the roof are 24 wind turbines generating 10% of the tower's electricity.[13]

With the Winter Olympics kicking into high gear in Sochi this week, GTM Research wanted to take a look at past Winter Olympics to see which countries ended up on the solar PV podium. We also used data from our global solar practice to make some predictions for this year's solar Olympics.
Torino 2006
Not only did Germany take home the most gold medals in the 2006 Winter Olympics, but it also installed the most solar. The country installed over 1,000 megawatts in 2006, a huge milestone at the time, and took home the solar gold. Japan wore silver around its neck with 286 megawatts installed, and Spain joined them on the podium with 88 megawatts.
Vancouver 2010
After four years of rigorous training, falling module prices and increased incentives, global solar competition stiffened. Germany proved again to be world solar champion, crushing its 2006 numbers with 7,378 megawatts of PV installed. (The International Olympic Committee still has not released a report on Germany's installer doping controversy.) Italy, away from its home turf in Torino, earned the silver in 2010, installing over 3,500 megawatts. The Czech Republic took home the bronze with a respectable 1,264 megawatts -- a giant feat for a small country.
Sochi 2014
So what's in store for Sochi this year? GTM Research expects 2014 to be the year when Germany is knocked off the podium entirely. According to our U.S. Solar Market Insight report, the United States, led by notable Olympian California, will finally earn itself a bronze medal, installing over 5,300 megawatts over the course of the year. Japan will earn its second silver medal in three tries with 7,500 megawatts installed. But the victor will be a new face in the solar Winter Olympic standings: China. The country is forecasted to install 12,000 megawatts of PV in 2014 alone -- more than the United States has installed in all of its solar history.
"China's rise to the top in global PV installations has been impressive, to say the least," said GTM Research solar analyst Adam James. "Although transparency continues to be a problem in accurately sizing the market, GTM sees the shift to production-based incentives and increased downstream financing support driving deployment to new heights over the next few years."

"While European feed-in tariff markets have been great at the short-distance events, the global solar market is clearly aiming toward the long-distance contenders in Asia and North America," said Shayle Kann, senior vice president at GTM Research. "But don't count out emerging markets. By the time the Summer Olympics roll around in Rio, Latin America will be a PV force to contend with."

So it turns out being able to feel my emotions more keenly does not mean being able to understand them better. I've been on the edge of tears for the past hour, and I have no idea why. My softer skin, slowly regenerating hairline, and small little proto-boobs are the parts of hormone therapy that will help me, hopefully, someday be able to pass. As wonderful as those effects are, I have to say it's the ongoing rewiring of my brain that is becoming the biggest focus for me. It's funny how my brain can know I'm a woman even drenched in testosterone, but once I finally get a taste of estrogen, suddenly my mind doesn't know what to do with itself.
The change happened with more subtlety than I had expected, but it is very clearly underway now. I had thought that with the rush of estrogen, things would sort of click and hey, now I have girl emotions, isn't that neat. It doesn't work that way. For the first few weeks, I felt almost no difference. It's been a few months now, and the changes are starting to become evident. They probably were in effect for a while, but like realizing that you're hungry, it sneaks up on you. Then suddenly, it's there, and it's been there for weeks.
Estrogen doesn't make my emotions stronger, it gives them more density. Anger burns hotter. Laughter builds higher. Sadness tastes stronger, but isn't really worse. Its a misnomer to say the highs are higher and the lows are lower. You physically can't get to lower lows than what I experienced already this year or you'll die, and the highs aren't higher, they're just more vivid. In comparison, my life before estrogen feels muted, hazed. I lived in pastels.
Here's the thing: I had felt that my emotions were muted and grey before I ever took any estrogen. This was something I knew about even in my younger teenage years. I had the feeling that something was subtlety wrong, that I wasn't feeling everything I was supposed to. I wondered at time if I was an emotional cripple, incapable of feeling real things. I wonder, did the part of me that expected to be a girl cause this? Was it a result of lacking the estrogen I was supposed to have? That would be an interesting question for a neurologist to puzzle out.
I'm happy to finally be righting myself, to finally be feeling the world. I feel alive.

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court ruled on two big tech-related cases: Riley v. California, in which it held that police can't search cellphones without a warrant, and ABC v. Aereo, where it decided that the startup Aereo's system to allow users to stream broadcast TV on their phones and computers violated copyright law.
But during April's oral arguments on the cases, the justices broadcast their own lack of technological expertise. Antonin Scalia didn't realize HBO was cable. During a line of questioning involving Dropbox and iCloud, Sonia Sotomayor referred to “the iDrop.” And Stephen Breyer said that they aren't sure if they owned an iPhone, “because I can never get into it because of the password.”
Sadly, this isn't the first time the justices—whose average age is 68—have been befuddled by tech terminology. Here's a list of some other ways the highest court in the land has struggled to keep pace with the times:
The Internet: Justice John Paul Stevens' description of how people spend time online in Reno v. ACLU, a 1997 case that was the court's first major ruling involving the internet, wasn't wrong per se. But the sheer number of scare quotes in their majority opinion—”those [resources] most relevant to this case are electronic mail (‘e-mail'), automatic mailing list services (‘mail exploders,' sometimes referred to as ‘listservs'), ‘newsgroups,' ‘chat rooms,' and the ‘World Wide Web'”—suggests the man themselves had never spent a minute online. They helpfully sum it all up for us: “Taken together, these tools constitute a unique medium—known to its users as ‘cyberspace'—located in no particular geographical location but available to anyone, anywhere in the world, with access to the Internet.”
Email: Instead of communicating by computers, members of the court still send each other paper memos. “The justices are not necessarily the most technologically sophisticated people,” Justice Elena Kagan told a group of students at Brown University in 2013. “The court hasn't really ‘gotten to' email.” But hey, at least they have copy machines now.
Coding: Aereo and Riley weren't the court's only tech-related cases this term. It also heard Alice v. CLS Bank, a case involving software patenting, which gave Justice Anthony Kennedy a chance to share their understanding of simple coding must be. Looking at a complex set of steps for mitigating settlement risks among multiple parties, they suggested that “any computer group of people sitting around a coffee shop in Silicon Valley” could turn it into code over a weekend. But Chief Justice John Roberts disagreed: “Just looking at it,” they said, “it looks pretty complicated. There are a lot of arrows.”
Genetics: When the court ruled last June that human genes can't be patented, the scientific community celebrated. But in their concurring opinion, Scalia was frank about the fact that they aren't really sure what was going on with all that science stuff: “I join the judgment of the Court, except [the portions] going into fine details of molecular biology. I am unable to affirm those details on my own knowledge or even my own belief.”
Sexting: When sexting was explained to Scalia during a 2010 case about whether a city had the right to search its employee's pager, they didn't really seem to get the concept. “Could [the employee] print these spicy little conversations and send them to their buddies?” they asked. At least this week's cellphone case didn't require Scalia to demonstrate their knowledge of Snapchat.
Social media: It's actually a little unclear if it's virtual friendships that leave Breyer cold, or just Aaron Sorkin. “If I'm applying the First Amendment, I have to apply it to a world where there's an Internet, and there's Facebook,” they said in a 2010 speech. “And there are movies like The Social Network, which I couldn't even understand.”
Player pianos: It's not just this century's justices who lack tech acumen. In the 1908 case White-Smith Music Publishing Co. v. Apollo Co., the court ruled that composers couldn't demand royalties on player piano rolls. Its rationale? Because humans couldn't read the rolls, they weren't actually copies.
One of the worst tornadoes in America history tore through Joplin, Missouri on Sunday night, killing at least 89 people and destroying at least a quarter of the town–an exact count of the devastation was impossible due to the disruption to local infrastructure. Joplin is a mid-sized community of approximately 50,000 people. And for a variety of reasons, the tornado ended up being documented by social media much more extensively than by national news television networks.
Much like another recent news story that broke on a Sunday night–the death of Osama Bin Laden–and like the successful ditching of US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River in 2009, amateur journalists quickly disseminated and constructed a narrative on the spot. Twitter users found the service awash in a stream of requests for aid and prayers that were interspersed with photos and on the spot reports. The same phenomenon also occurred on YouTube and Facebook. While the networks rushed from the big cities and Joplin's local news media found themselves overstretched, local would-be journalists stepped into the lurch.

The chaos in Joplin played out in interesting ways that would fascinate media theoreticians. With the disaster physically overwhelming phone lines and transportation disrupted due to devastation conditions, social media became a primary method of contact for survivors. According to staffers at the Wichita Eagle who reported on the scene:
On social networking sites, people with ties to Joplin and even those without were calling for prayers for the city. Some people were quick to post that they and their families are OK, or to get the word out that loved ones are missing or homes were destroyed. Others found themselves without access to phones because of overburdened phone lines, but able to text and use social media.
Users on Twitter quickly uploaded devastating pictures of the impact to Twitpic and other services. For just one example, a Kansas-based Twitter user named @parismyloveff uploaded pictures of the ruins of what used to be a local Home Depot and a Payless ShoeSource where two women disappeared.
An independent assessment revealed that the majority of their deliveries exceeded the 15 degrees level of tolerance.
The International Cricket Council today announced that an independent assessment has found the bowling action of Pakistan's Mohammad Hafeez to be illegal and, as such, the off-spinner has been suspended from bowling in international cricket with immediate effect.
The assessment revealed that the majority of their deliveries exceeded the 15 degrees level of tolerance permitted under the regulations.
In accordance with Article 11.1 of the ICC Illegal Bowling Regulations, Hafeez's international suspension will also be recognised and enforced by all National Cricket Federations for domestic cricket events played in their own jurisdiction. However, pursuant to Article 11.5 of the Regulations and with the consent of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Hafeez may be able to bowl in domestic cricket events played under the auspices of the PCB.
Hafeez was reported during the third One-Day International against Sri Lanka, which was played on 18 October in Abu Dhabi and had undergone an independent assessment of their bowling action on 1 November at Loughborough University.
Hafeez can apply for a re-assessment after modifying their bowling action in accordance with clause 4.5 of the Regulations.

Around half of small firms say Brexit will change their trading habits, but they're not sure how, ​according to money transfer platform TransferWise.
Numerous small firms rely on international income, but Brexit uncertainty is leaving them in a trade limbo.
Over a quarter receive more than £100,000 a year in international turnover. With nearly 99 per cent of the UK's 5.5m businesses being small and medium-sized firms, with an average turnover of £327,000, for many international trades could equate to a third of their annual income.
Over half of Britain's small firms send or receive foreign currency payments as part of regular business activities, and are often left confused at the overall cost of foreign transactions. Exchange rate mark-ups on international payments charged to small and medium businesses came to £4.1bn in total for the previous year, according to research by Capital Economics.

Taavet Hinrikus, TransferWise's chief executive, said: "UK SMEs have embraced the international marketplace, and many are raking in a significant portion of their income from overseas custom. The uncertainty about what Brexit means for imports and exports could be hugely damaging for these companies, and it's time the government took action to help."
Hinrikus said the government's opportunity is in the Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) which mandates transparency in the asupervisorstioned transactions. The draft regulations have recently been released for consultation.

"Back in 2015 the government pledged to bring transparency to the foreign currency industry. PSD2 was the perfect opportunity for the government to do something for small businesses, given the directive states that people should know ‘the real costs and charges' of transferring money abroad," they added. "And yet the UK government has chosen to leave this out of the draft regulations - bowing to pressure from the banks and effectively putting two fingers up at UK businesses."
"There is time to change the final regulations, but the government must act now. It won't alleviate Brexit uncertainty, but it will mean a fairer deal for all those British businesses who trade internationally," Hinrikus said.
President Donald Trump renewed their call to repeal and “replace” the Affordable Care Act during their address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday, but they once again did not offer any real details about what should succeed the landmark health care overhaul.
Throughout their campaign and ever since their surprising Election Day victory, Trump has promised to produce a plan that would reduce cost and increase access, a vow they restated Monday. But outside of some general platitudes that Trump has long endorsed, the president offered no new guidelines for a replacement to former President Barack Obama's 2010 law, which extended coverage to 20 million previously uninsured Americans.
While Trump's speech will likely win praise from congressional Republicans, and their general principles for health care may allay some in the general public, Trump didn't say anything likely to quell the discontent among the House and Senate GOP as they wade into policy specifics that have left them reeling.
“He talked about repeal and replace tonight. Fine. They need to present something,” Tuesday Group Chairman Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) said after the speech. “He provided some detail; we'll need more.”
In their remarks to lawmakers, Trump disappointed anyone hoping they would take the lead on the Obamacare repeal and “replace” effort amid the increasingly difficult political atmosphere characterized by angry citizens storming lawmakers' town halls and the suddenly rising popularity of the health care law.
Republicans applauded Trump's exhortation to gut Obamacare, and they found other things to cheer during the five-minute health care portion of their speech. But for the lawmakers actually familiar with the complexity of “replacing” the Affordable Care Act, it was revealing that the president put the onus on Congress to resolve this issue.
Compare that vague, lead-from-behind approach to Trump's section on a tax overhaul, where they said, “My economic team is developing historic tax reform.”
Where tax reform is his, Obamacare is on Congress, Trump seemed to be saying.
Tellingly, Trump also made a plea for bipartisan action on health care reform. “I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster,” they said.
Part of this is mere math: Republicans hold a slim majority in the Senate and will need Democratic votes to advance major parts of their health care agenda.
But it also calls to mind Trump's repeated statements ― including just a day ago ― that their best political course would be to stand pat and do nothing to address the health care system, in hopes any further troubles will be blamed on the Democrats who created the Affordable Care Act.
Trump mostly recounted common talking points about the shortcomings of the Affordable Care Act and the promises that Republican policies would be superior. Unlike they repeatedly have vowed, however, Trump shied away from promising universal health care coverage.
As they did during their presidential campaign, Trump hit several major themes that broadly adhere to Republican orthodoxy on health care policy:
Health insurance costs are too high. Consumers have too few insurers to choose from. States need more flexibility to alter their Medicaid programs. Americans should have greater access to tax-free health savings accounts. Health insurers should be permitted to sell policies to out-of-state customers. Trump also called for limits on medical malpractice lawsuits and lower prescription drug prices.
One part that Republicans will certainly take note of will be Trump's endorsement of tax credits. Conservatives are currently locked in a fight with GOP leadership over the idea of advance refundable tax credits.
But Trump's speech didn't wade deeply enough into the weeds for anyone to really determine whether they support the specific tax credits proposed by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and opposed by conservative factions in Congress, or some other type of tax credit.
Trump said they favor tax credits to defray the cost of insurance and access to coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, but failed to say how.
“There were no specifics on that end,” House Freedom Caucus member Rep. Gary Palmer (R-Ala.) said, referring to Trump's call for tax credits in a replacement, “and I think that's an important thing to note.”
The Freedom Caucus has come out forcefully against any Obamacare alternative that uses advance refundable tax credits, arguing that it would create a new entitlement program. Trump endorsed the idea of “tax credits” in a replacement, but they didn't clarify what that means, leaving Republicans free to interpret that principle as whatever they want.
“I don't believe we heard any specific legislative endorsements,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said Tuesday night in response to a question about the tax credits.
Plans circulating on Capitol Hill so far would lead to far fewer people covered by health insurance and to higher out-of-pocket costs, especially for older people and those with low incomes. A draft House Republican bill ― since disavowed by GOP leadership ― would offer financial assistance to some Americans and a form of protections for people with pre-existing conditions, but they fall far short of what the Affordable Care Act already provides.
Trump's address Tuesday night may get a warm Republican reception, and their lack of specifics may mean that every corner of the GOP conference can claim that Trump is really on their side, but it did nothing to bring Republicans out of their Obamacare quagmire and won't provide the protection that GOP leadership may have wanted from Trump owning a repeal.
This story has been updated to include comment from Palmer, Cruz and Dent.

DRAGONS RPG (Diceless, Rule-sparse, All-Genre, Open, Nonrestrictive System for RPGs) is a flexible roleplaying system that combines the best parts of classical pen and paper games like interesting adventures, rich characters and a unique battle system, with elements of a trading card game. The cards you are using are, however, conventional poker cards, so there is no need to spend money on collecting them.
DRAGONS RPG can be used in any setting, ranging from fantasy over apocalyptic or horror to science fiction, so that adventures from other franchises can be easily adapted and played with DRAGONS RPG.
There is no need for dice or dice rolls, all randomness comes from drawing or playing cards. This makes combat more of a strategically interesting experience and far quicker than systems where lots of dice must be rolled in order to determine the effect of a single attack.
Like a classical pen and paper role playing game, DRAGONS RPG should be played with a game master. Cooperation is very important, and the possibility to trade cards with your allies during combat and the fact that every character can use cards for different effects, makes combat very tactical and interesting.

Long Military Convoy of Terrorists Targeted by Syrian Army in Southwestern Damascus
TEHRAN (FNA)- A long military column of the terrorist groups was destroyed by the Syrian Army as it was taking tens of fresh forces to Khan al-Sheih region in Western Ghouta.
The military convoy of Ahrar al-Sham and Fatah al-Sham Front (the al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group previously known as the al-Nusra Front), including a tank, four military vehicles and tens of fresh forces, came under heavy attack by the Syrian government forces on the way to Khan al-Sheih.
The convoy was to join terrorist groups in Khan al-Sheih to help them resist against the growing advances of the Syrian army in the region.
A large number of terrorists were killed or injured in the attack.
Syrian government forces have gained eye-catching victories against the militants in Western Ghouta in recent weeks.
Retired Army General Heisam Hassoun said on Tuesday that the Syrian army is nearing the end of its large-scale military operations in Western Ghouta and the war on terrorism in the Western parts of Damascus province will end soon as tens of towns and cities have been purged of terrorists.
"The final phase of the military operations in the Western countryside of Damascus, specifically in Western Ghouta is underway," Gen. Hassoun told FNA on Tuesday.
They said the Syrian army has now focused on cutting off all the supply and defense lines of the terrorists, specially after it could score a major achievement in winning control over the town of Darkhabieh and establishing security there.
"The security chain will be expanded further by spreading control over the region between Darkhabieh and Darousha towns," they added.
Categorieseasy to grow ginger growing foods
Growing ginger at home is the cheapest way to make sure you never run out of this wonderful medicinal plant. Homegrown ginger not only tastes better it also is free from harmful chemicals that are so dominant in commercial ginger.
Before starting our discussion about How to grow ginger plants First we need to understand the basics. Not all ginger variety are edible. Many of the ginger varieties are used as ornamental plants(ginger flowers). If you are planning to grow ginger for eating purposes the best-known species is Zingiber officinale.
When we talk about the edible part of ginger, we generally refer to ginger root. But it is the rhizomes (modified stem) that we eat. The ginger rhizome is aromatic, pungent, and are spicy. And are often referred to as ginger roots.
It is one of the plants which need very less amount of caring and maintenance. You just need to know the basics of growing ginger.
How to grow Ginger?
Ginger is a tropical plant. It grows well in humid climates. So if you live in a warm climate you shouldn't have any problem growing ginger. Now, if your climate is a dry one, a bit of spraying will definitely help the plant.
Ginger is actually pretty easy to grow. You grow ginger indoor, in your backward or even in raised beds.
how to grow ginger plants
Ideal site selection for a ginger plant:
Ginger loves sunlight. So make sure the place you are growing ginger receives enough sunlight. If you are growing ginger indoor you have to arrange some kind of artificial light to fulfill their needs. As mentioned in my article Sun or No-Sun, Sunlight is very important for this type of plants.
The Ideal soil for growing Ginger root:
Ginger prefers slightly acidic soil (pH level 6.1 to 6.5). If you find your soil pH is not up to that level you can amend the soil accordingly.
Use loose loamy soil to grow ginger. Add a good amount of compost with the soil before planting ginger. You can also use a good quality potting soil and mix it with compost.
How to plant Ginger root:
Always try to grow the plant from the organic ginger. A very good source for this is getting a fresh ginger root from a neighbor who is also growing ginger.
If you want to grow ginger that is bought from a local grocery store, soak it in water overnight. This is because store-bought ginger is treated with growth retardant (in most cases). Soaking them in water will dissolve the chemicals.
A ginger root (rhizome) have small eyes. When the eyes turn green in color that is probably the best time to plant them. Each eye will give rise to a single ginger plant.
Cut the rhizome in parts(1-1.5 inch) without damaging the eyes. Set these pieces of ginger aside till they form a callus.
While planting always put the eye side (the buds) upwards and just below the soil. Then cover it with soil.
A ginger plant can grow 3-4 feet tall. While planting keep that in mind so you can give enough space between two plants.
Watering A Ginger Plant:
Water is also a crucial factor in growing ginger. Make sure the soil is moist while the active growing season of ginger is going on.
Use mulch to make the better use of the soil moisture. Mulch prevents water from evaporation. Adding different soilless media with the soil can also increase the water retention of the soil. Also, try not to over-water. It will also drain out the nutrients from the soil.
How to Fertilize the ginger plant:
Ginger is not a voracious eater. So, if you have added enough compost before planting ginger you don't need to add much.
In case you leave in a place where the rain is plenty and your soil gets drenched many times, chances are your soil nutrition also fades away with the water. Here you need to add nutrients like seaweed, fish extractions or other organic manure from outside.

Hilling of ginger plants:
In approximately 4 to 6 weeks after planting, check the base of the ginger shoots. Once you find a bright pink substance at the base of the stem, cover the base with soil. This is also called hilling of ginger plants.
Repeat the process every 2 to 4 weeks.
Harvesting Ginger Roots:
Ginger plant generally takes 8 months or more to mature. Once you see some drying leaves your ginger is probably matured and it is time for harvesting. Many people pull out ginger earlier than this but the mature ginger always tastes better.
While harvesting, look out for rhizomes with buds in it, these are easier to use for replanting.
Ginger Flower:
ginger flower
Some varieties of Ginger flowers are exceptionally fragrant. So if you find flowers you can definitely snip them and use it in other decorative formats (like making a bouquet).
Do not worry this will not harm the health of the plant. Flowering needs at least two years. So if you are thinking about flowers you have to harvest very carefully and should only extract a few from here and there.
Ginger As A Companion Plant:
Ginger is a very good companion plant. You can club ginger with other plants for pest control purposes. Plants from the legume family, cilantro, peppers etc do very well with ginger.
You can find more options in different combinations in my earlier article titled Companion Planting: A basic Know-how.

If you've been keeping your eyes peeled for all things BH5, you might have seen this breaking news about a brand-new character in the show.
The inside scoop from the writers paints a pretty evil picture...
"Captain Hatch has seen it all, at least they reckon they have, and whatever it is, they don't much like it. Stuck in a failing body, in a wheelchair, in a dismal seaside hotel, things aren't exactly sunny side up."
"Hatch embodies the worst in humanity - he's bitter, manipulative, obsequious and cruel. And beneath their decrepit exterior there lies within them a dark and toxic secret that could rattle your soul with fear."
Sounds pretty interesting doesn't it? Even more exciting is that Captain Hatch will be played by BAFTA nominated actor Phil Davis, who you'll probably recognise from other BBC dramas like Bleak House, Sherlock and Merlin.
Here's what they had to say about their new role:
"I don't want to give too much away about the character at this early stage but I can reveal that they are marvellously disgusting."
So, a great new disgustingly evil character to look forward to. We can't wait to see what Captain Hatch gets up to. Have you got any ideas what they might have in store? Let us know!
More good and evil gossip as we get it!
Waste treatment plant. Image: Flickr user h080
Never really known as a friendly group, the Italian mafia has been brutally murdering people for hundreds of years. Most of the time, these killings are quick—some henchmen waylay the target, squeeze a trigger a few times and make their getaway. Yet according to a new report released last week by the Italian National Institute of Health, a few local Italian mobs have been slowly killing dozens of innocent people for decades by way of a multibillion dollar toxic waste disposal racket.
In 2014, the Italian parliament mandated that the National Institute of Health conduct an investigation into the higher than normal rates of death and cancer in 55 municipalities of the Naples and Caserta regions of southern Italy. This region has garnered the nicknames "the Land of Fires" thanks to the frequency with which toxic waste is burned by the local Camorra mob, a practice which gave rise to the region's other nickname: the Triangle of Death.
The Camorra mob has been running a multi-billion dollar racket in which they dispose of toxic waste for businesses in Italy's industrial north since at least the early 1990s. By skirting environmental regulations the mob is able to dispose of these hazardous industrial materials for a fraction of the cost of legal disposal, and the industrialists in the north are smart enough to not ask questions about what happens to their garbage once it leaves their hands.
An estimated 10 million tons of toxic waste has been buried and burned at a number of dump sites throughout Naples in the last 20 years. This has led to the widespread contamination of the underground wells which irrigate the farmland in the Naples region, which provides vegetables for much of Italy's center and south.
In recent years this has led police to sequester dozens of fields because their irrigation wells were found to contain high levels of lead, arsenic and the industrial solvent tetrachloride. The poisoning of the well water has led to what the new NIH report describes as a "critical" health crisis in the region which is characterized by "excessive" rates of tumors in newborn infants, particularly brain tumors.
Local residents have long known about the Camorra mob's racket and have been complaining about the resulting health crisis for years to authorities. This culminated in 2013 with a massive protest numbering well over 30,000 people calling for an end to the mafia's dumping. The public outrage prompted the Italian parliament to order an NIH investigation into the matter in 2014. Last week's report was an update to the 2014 report and blames the higher than average rates of cancer and death in the Naples region on "ascertained or suspected exposure to a combination of environmental contaminants that can be emitted or released from illegal dump hazardous waste sites or the uncontrolled burning of both urban and hazardous waste."
The report is a step in the right direction, but for many locals it only confirms what they have known and suffered for years, Reverend Maurizio Patriciello, a priest in the area, pointed out.
"Can we claim victory? Absolutely not," they wrote in Avvenire, the newspaper of the Italian bishops' conference, on Saturday. "In this shameful, sad and painful story, we have lost everything. The government above all."
Battle Creek S01E01: "The Battle Creek Way"
Even with plenty of "high-concept" television on the air, good, sturdy series often still hail from the most typical of places. CBS's new police procedural Battle Creek is indeed a new CBS police procedural. Yet, the series—which was created by Vince Gilligan and sold to the network long before Breaking Bad, to now be shepherded by House executive producer David Shore—combines all the familiar notes of the TV cop show and plays them in a slightly different fashion. Sometimes, after a new beat here and a swapped-out riff there, the music is immediately recognizable but just a tiny bit better.
Battle Creek centers on the ramshackle police department of Battle Creek, Michigan, a moderately sized town facing the slow, churning death of globalization and lost jobs. That descent extends to the underfunded professionals who've vowed to protect and serve: Russ Agnew (Dean Winters) and Fontanelle White (Kal Penn) are the city's detective A-Team, and when a relatively simple sting goes awry due to some faulty equipment, their pleas for more money and support are finally heard... sort of. Instead of better tasers and recording devices, Battle Creek gets the handsome, smooth-talking FBI Special Agent Milt Chamberlin (Josh Duhamel). And as Milt takes the reigns in Battle Creek, Russ's ego rips into overdrive, resulting in a whole lot of frustration and wise-cracking—but also some solid police work.
As far as labored, mismatched buddy copy set-ups go, Battle Creek's is pretty low on the list. The pilot waves away the premise-y nature of it all by name-dropping the FBI's resident agencies, of which there are nearly 400 across the country, according to my friend Google. Winters' Russ is the shaggy dog, Duhamel's Milt is the well-dressed charmer, and everyone else—including Penn, unfortunately—is along for the ride.
Winters and Duhamel thrive in their individual roles and bounce off one another pretty well (I've already seen a few episodes of Battle Creek, and the show improves in each one). If you're a big Winters fan like I am, you've probably been waiting for them to score a choice lead role like this, and their performance doesn't disappoint. "The Battle Creek Way" required them to play up Russ's frustration with Milt in a very pilot-y fashion, but those brief moments didn't bother me all too much. I'm guessing that viewers will be more divided on Duhamel, who in my mind has been wrongfully discarded as just a pretty face. Dude is certainly handsome, but in projects like Battle Creek, he's able to handle comedy, action, and more dramatic material fairly successfully. While the first episode's stakes weren't especially high, Milt's arrival in Battle Creek had a bit of a mystery to it, and so Duhamel got to play with that just enough in a very unfussy fashion.
What makes Battle Creekan admirable entry in the buddy-cop genre—and what helped the pilot get through some of its more establishing beats—is that it has a really fun sense of humor. "The Battle Creek Way" didn't strain to deliver jokes or produce the kind of banter that we normally see on shows like this, but it delivered them nonetheless. The opening sequence, which spotlighted the sheer lack of resources that Russ and Fontanelle must deal with when trying to do their jobs, was a nicely paced and well-executed bit of comedic storytelling that primed the audience for failure, only to turn in something contextually funnier than we could've imagined.
Generally, the pilot benefited from a bunch of smaller elements that came together pretty nicely: Russ desperately trying to change their department's fortunes by cold-calling 60 Minutes' Lesley Stahl, the calming of the big police siege on the drug lord's home when the guy politely invited them in, the final moment where we were led to believe that Russ had finally earned their moment in the sun thanks to the great media coverage, only for the newspaper to cut their face out of the photo... none of that stuff screamed JOKES, but it effectively established the messy-but-charming nature of these characters and of Battle Creek itself.
It'll be easy to attribute the success of this first episode to Gilligan, and while that's not unreasonable, it also doesn't paint the entire picture, nor does it properly modulate viewer expectations. To the latter point, Battle Creek is not Breaking Bad—not even in terms of Breaking Bad's more darkly funny early episodes. It might be a little closer to the brand-new Better Call Saul in tone, but even that's not a particularly productive comparison. Though Gilligan helped birth one of the greatest and most innovative TV shows in the medium's history, he's also a dude who's been in the proverbial trenches, churning out solid (and sometimes bad) TV. Battle Creek and its pilot feel as if they're rooted in that entirely professional but not entirely stupendous background, and that's totally okay.
And to the former point, Gilligan shares a co-credit on the pilot with Shore, another TV veteran who knows how to mix comedy and drama within the context of the procedural storytelling engine. It's not surprising that Shore is involved with this project, both because CBS likely wanted a reliable hand to guide the show post-pilot once Gilligan stepped away and because Shore has tried to reboot The Rockford Files a couple of times in the past few years and clearly has an interest in this kind of project. Battle Creek has a long, long way to go before it'll be ready to entertain any comparisons to The Rockford Filesand neither of its stars can touch James Garner, but Battle Creek's early episodes absolutely convey the fact that Shore is really reveling in the show's world, and its characters in particular.
Shore's preexisting relationship with director Bryan Singer means that this opener boasted another big name behind the camera (for what it's worth, I'd posit that Gilligan not directing it was a pretty clear sign that he's not super interested in working with the show very closely). Singer's work here was much better than their work on the House pilot so many years ago, which was quite an ugly TV episode to look at. It's disappointing that CBS and Sony didn't want to try to shoot on location in Michigan, so we're stuck with Los Angeles trying and failing to capture the midwest of it all, but Singer shoots confidently and effectively. And "The Battle Creek Way" didn't contain a major action sequence that the show will never be able to afford in the future, which I kind of like. The stakes are smaller, and that's refreshing in a world where shows like Scorpion trade in MAJOR WORLD EVENTS immediately and then have to film a second episode.
Battle Creek's introductory hour did struggle to use many of the show's supporting players, who are pretty strong. Janet McTeer, Damon Herriman, Liza Lapira, and Aubrey Dollar are all recognizable faces who simply served to populate the police station in Episode 1. And as I hinted at above, I was especially bummed to see Penn sidelined so quickly; while that changes a little in Episode 2, which gives their character a fun subplot and some good scenes with Duhamel's Milt, it does appear that Battle Creek is still trying to feel out everyone's role in the weekly storylines. And that's fine—I just don't want these folks to go to waste.
As a pilot, "The Battle Creek Way" gave us a lot to like. Winters and Duhamel were good, the shaggy nature of the story and tone really worked, and Battle Creek immediately convinced me that it knows what kind of show it is. I'm not quite sure how the series jives with the range of other procedurals that CBS already has on its schedule, but the good news is that the network chose to air it on Sundays, a de facto night for prestige television. That suggests CBS is aware that its normal audience might be lukewarm on Battle Creek; the question is whether or not people who wouldn't normally tune in for a CBS series will take to it. But I hope they will, as there's enough promise here that I'll continue watching for awhile, which is not something I'd say about most of the network's other dramatic output.
NOTES
– Having also seen Episodes 2 and 3, I'll note that the show makes small improvements in both episodes. The supporting cast has a little more to do, and the tension between Milt and Russ plays a bit better. Battle Creek's procedural formula is pretty standard, but there's enough interesting stuff around the edges to keep viewers coming back, I think.
– Gilligan should teach a class on how to come up with great character names. Milt Chamberlin? Come on. Fontanelle White? Nice.
– Seeing Damon Herriman play someone who's weirdly charming and sympathetic but isn't Dewey Crowe is just not something I'm ready for quite yet. Too soon.
– No offense to this show, but Janet McTeer has too many trophies somewhere in their home to be playing the tough-but-fair commander character. They deserve their own cable series.

× Pair sentenced for armed robbery in parking lot of Park City mall
LANCASTER, Pa.–Two men arrested for robbing a man in the parking lot of the Park City mall on Oct. 23 will spend up to 10 years in prison, according to the Lancaster County District Attorney's office.
Tyler Harrison, 22, and Randy Howard, 19, both of Columbia, were sentenced recently in Lancaster County court. Harrison will spend 4 to 10 years behind bars for their role in the robbery. A judge sentenced Howard to serve 2 to 10 years.
Investigators said that Howard initially approached the victim in the parking lot and asked them for a lighter. That's when prosecutors said Harrison walked up to the victim and pulled out a gun.
The victim then pulled their own gun out and Howard and Harrison ran off. Investigators said the victim followed the pair and called 911.
Lancaster City Police caught them behind a nearby restaurant.
Prosecutors said Harrison was more culpable, because the robbery was their idea and they had the gun.

Police arrested 35-year-old Alvin Kenneth "Chico" Welch Jr. on Wednesday in the death of 31-year-old Joshua Andrew Heinz Saturday night.
Welch and Heinz had been watching football with friends and Welch was getting a take-home plate when they and Heinz got into an argument over how the meat was being sliced, the Florida Times-Union reported.
Assistant Chief Chris Butler said the argument escalated and Heinz was hit with the bat. They were taken to a nearby hospital and later died from their injuries.
Butler says the two men were acquaintances. The party was at Heinz's house.
"The suspect after the argument took the baseball bat and basically fled," Butler said.
Welch was arrested early Wednesday and was being held without bail at the Jacksonville jail Thursday morning. It was unknown whether they have an attorney.

Neuronal plasticity peaks early in life during critical periods and normally declines with age, but the molecular changes that underlie this decline are not fully understood. Using the mouse visual cortex as a model, we found that activity-dependent expression of the neuronal protein Arc peaks early in life, and that loss of activity-dependent Arc expression parallels loss of synaptic plasticity in the visual cortex. Genetic overexpression of Arc prolongs the critical period of visual cortex plasticity, and acute viral expression of Arc in adult mice can restore juvenile-like plasticity. These findings provide a mechanism for the loss of excitatory plasticity with age, and suggest that Arc may be an exciting therapeutic target for modulation of the malleability of neuronal circuits.
Abstract
The molecular basis for the decline in experience-dependent neural plasticity over age remains poorly understood. In visual cortex, the robust plasticity induced in juvenile mice by brief monocular deprivation during the critical period is abrogated by genetic deletion of Arc, an activity-dependent regulator of excitatory synaptic modification. Here, we report that augmenting Arc expression in adult mice prolongs juvenile-like plasticity in visual cortex, as assessed by recordings of ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in vivo. A distinguishing characteristic of juvenile OD plasticity is the weakening of deprived-eye responses, believed to be accounted for by the mechanisms of homosynaptic long-term depression (LTD). Accordingly, we also found increased LTD in visual cortex of adult mice with augmented Arc expression and impaired LTD in visual cortex of juvenile mice that lack Arc or have been treated in vivo with a protein synthesis inhibitor. Further, we found that although activity-dependent expression of Arc mRNA does not change with age, expression of Arc protein is maximal during the critical period and declines in adulthood. Finally, we show that acute augmentation of Arc expression in wild-type adult mouse visual cortex is sufficient to restore juvenile-like plasticity. Together, our findings suggest a unifying molecular explanation for the age- and activity-dependent modulation of synaptic sensitivity to deprivation.
"Indisputable" that U.S. practiced torture after 9/11 A lengthy independent review found that the country's highest officials and president condoned torture
While a 6,000-page Senate report on the CIA's use of extraordinary rendition and enhanced interrogation remains shrouded from public view, a new report released Tuesday by a legal research and advocacy group states, in no uncertain terms, that the U.S. practiced torture in the years following 9/11. As the New York Times noted, the report from the Constitution Project "is the most ambitious independent attempt to date to assess the detention and interrogation programs." Based on interviews with former American and foreign officials, as well as former detainees, the report investigated the post-9/11 treatment of suspects at at Guantánamo Bay, in Afghanistan and Iraq, and at CIA black sites.
Not only did the task force conclude that U.S. use of torture was "indisputable" but that “the kind of considered and detailed discussions that occurred after 9/11 directly involving a president and their top advisers on the wisdom, propriety and legality of inflicting pain and torment on some detainees in our custody.”

In a hit piece on UKIP founding member and MEP Gerard Batten, Huffington Post columnist Asa Bennett makes the bizarre implication that questioning media ownership is an act of anti-Semitism.
The article, entitled Meet Gerard Batten, The UKIP MEP Scare-Mongering About Islam, Immigrants And Bilderberg, cites a quote by Batten in which they point out that media owners are amongst the attendees at the annual Bilderberg Group conference of global power brokers. “Look who owns the media, it is owned by powerful people and they go to powerful meetings like this,” Batten said during an interview with Alex Jones last year.
“Batten's focus on media ownership draws concern from Jewish groups for its undertones,” writes Bennett, before quoting Mark Gardner, from the Community Security Trust (CST), who states, “Gerard Batten stresses that they do not believe the more extreme conspiracy theories about the Bilderberg Group, but any notions of secret political and media power can risk echoing well-worn anti-Semitic ideas.”
Apparently, according to Asa Bennett, Mark Gardner and the Huffington Post, merely voicing the opinion that the corporate media is owned by powerful people and that media ownership is becoming increasingly consolidated (both of which are manifestly provable facts), makes you a Jew-hating anti-Semite.
The article cites no example whatsoever of where Batten has made any anti-Jewish or anti-Semitic remarks. This is a classic case of an ad-hominem attack where name calling and baseless smear is used to attack someone's character in the absence of facts.
The reality is that just six corporations own all the major media outlets and that the press has never been more centralized into the hands of a powerful few. All of these six companies – Viacom, Disney, GE, News-Corp, Time Warner and CBS, have at one time or another been represented at Bilderberg meetings.
Another twist of irony is the fact that the Huffington Post is itself owned by a huge media conglomerate in AOL, which purchased the leftist news outlet in 2011 for $315 million dollars. Before their split in 2009, AOL owned numerous television networks and Hollywood production companies thanks to its 2000 merger with Time Warner.
Bennett also implies that merely talking about the Bilderberg Group, of which Batten has been a fierce critic, or ascribing any influence to the organization is a baseless conspiracy theory.
Bennett obviously failed to research the fact that Bilderberg chairperson Étienne Davignon bragged about how the euro single currency was a brainchild of the secretive group, with documents uncovered by the BBC proving that the euro was being discussed by Bilderberg members as far back as 1955, nearly 50 years before it came into effect.
They also omitted leaks out of the 2006 Bilderberg conference in Ottawa which show that the cabal was plotting for the housing bubble to burst and the economic collapse two years in advance, along with the plethora of other examples proving Bilderberg has exercised kingmaker power as well as setting the consensus for global policy on numerous occasions.
Bennett also erroneously dismisses Batten's assertion that “the European Union had been originally proposed by the Nazis.” This is an absolutely verifiable fact and is proven by US Military Intelligence report EW-Pa 128, also known as The Red House Report, which details how top Nazis secretly met at the Maison Rouge Hotel in Strasbourg on August 10, 1944 and, knowing Germany was on the brink of military defeat, conspired to create a Fourth Reich – a pan-European economic empire based around a European common market.
As it is routine for establishment hit pieces targeting populist voices with the “conspiracy theorist” jibe, Bennett's article is heavy on smear and insinuation but thin on factual honesty.
The mass media has done its level best to check UKIP's runaway success by contriving all manner of ludicrous hit pieces directed at the party and its leader, Nigel Farage, whipping up leftists into a fervor by constantly smearing UKIP members as racist and extremist.
However, the only extremism in evidence has been directed against UKIP itself by crazed leftists, including an assault on Batten's home after a brick was thrown through their window last week. Another UKIP candidate, Bobby Anwar, was viciously attacked by their Labour Party supporting neighbors who assaulted them with a sharp metal object. Nigel Farage has also been physically attacked on numerous occasions.
Current polls show that UKIP is enjoying a last minute surge of support and remains on course to triumph in this week's European elections, illustrating how constant attacks by a discredited establishment have helped and not hindered the party's popularity.

Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say they should get less than 10 years in prison MORE responded to the terror attack in Istanbul on Tuesday by warning that the “terrorist threat has never been greater” and calling for the United States to ramp up security measures.

“Our prayers are with the families of those killed and injured in Istanbul,” said a Trump campaign statement on Tuesday. “The whole world is stunned and horrified.”
Nearly 50 people were killed when several suicide bombers attacked the Istanbul Ataturk Airport on Tuesday. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.
“The terrorist threat has never been greater,” the statement continued. “Our enemies are brutal and ruthless and will do anything to murder those who do not bend to their will. We must take steps now to protect America from terrorists, and do everything in our power to improve our security to keep America safe.”
The presumptive Republican presidential nominee has called for a ban on Muslims from entering the country in response to terror attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., Paris and Orlando, but has recently leaned toward a country-specific policy.
On Tuesday, a Trump adviser told The Hill that Trump would draw back on the proposal if they are elected.
It happened in 2002, but it's the biggest political news story in America this week. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) has now confirmed that they spoke to a conference organized by former Representative David Duke (R-LA). The Washington Post:
“It's hard to believe, given David Duke's reputation in Louisiana, that somebody in politics in Louisiana wasn't aware of Duke's associations with the group and what they stand for,” said Rep. Joaquin Castro (Tex.), a rising star in the Democratic Party who is considered among the most prominent Hispanics in Congress. “If that's the case and they agreed to join them for their event, then I think it's a real test for Speaker Boehner as to whether member of congress Scalise should remain in Republican leadership,” Castro said in a phone interview.
The news could complicate Republican efforts to project the sense of a fresh start for a resurgent, diversifying party as the new session of Congress opens next week. In the time since voters handed control of Congress to Republicans, top GOP leaders have been eagerly trumpeting their revamped image and management team on Capitol Hill.
“For anyone to suggest that I was involved with a group like that is insulting and ludicrous,” Scalise told the Times-Picayune on Monday night. The organization, founded by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, has been called a hate group by several civil rights organizations.
Scalise, 49, who ascended to the House GOP's third-ranking post this year, confirmed through an adviser that they once appeared at a convention of the European-American Unity and Rights Organization, or EURO. But the adviser said the member of congress didn't know at the time about the group's affiliation with racists and neo-Nazi activists.
Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), the House majority whip, acknowledged Monday that they spoke at a gathering hosted by white-supremacist leaders while serving as a state representative in 2002, thrusting a racial controversy into House Republican ranks days before the party assumes control of both congressional chambers.
Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) called the news “a big deal.” “Race still is, sadly, an ugly aspect of our politics,” they said by e-mail. “No politician should ever find himself/herself addressing a white supremacist organization except to tell them to go to hell.” Associates of House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) are monitoring the situation, and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's staff had no comment. Scalise's political circle worked furiously late Monday to quell the storm, with their confidants e-mailing reporters and House members, assuring them that Scalise did not know the implications of their actions in 2002 and describing them as a disorganized and ill-prepared young politician who didn't pay close attention to invitations.
When Scalise was asked by the Times-Picayune how they came to appear at the conference, they cited their staff, saying they had only one person working for them at the time. “When someone called and asked me to speak, I would go,” they said. “If I knew today what they were about, I wouldn't go.” In a phone interview late Monday from their home in Mandeville, La., Duke recalled Scalise as a “nice guy” and said they were invited to the conference by two of Duke's longtime associates: Howie Farrell, who had worked on Duke's gubernatorial campaign, and Kenny Knight. Scalise “says they didn't realize what the conference was. I don't know if they did or did not,” Duke said. They also said Scalise should not be forced to resign, saying Scalise was merely taking an opportunity to meet with “constituents.”
“What politician would ever pass up an opportunity to talk to their constituents?” Duke said. “It sounds like they are just playing politics.” Duke said they spoke to the conference twice, once by phone and later by video hookup. But they did not hear Scalise speak, they said, and does not know whether Scalise heard them speak. In a statement, Scalise's spokesperson, Moira Bagley Smith, emphasized that the then-state lawmaker was unaware at the time of the group's ideology and mission. “He has never been affiliated with the abhorrent group in question,” Smith said. “The hate-fueled ignorance and intolerance that group projects is in stark contradiction to what Mr. Scalise believes and practices as a father, a husband, and a devoted Catholic.” Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), a leading conservative in the House, said in an interview Monday that they stood by Scalise and believed that many conservatives in the House's hard-right bloc would do the same. “Jesus dined with tax collectors and sinners,” King said. “It's not the healthy who need a doctor, it's the sick. Given that piece of Scripture, and understanding that Scalise probably wasn't staffed thoroughly, I could understand how something like this happened. But I know their heart, I've painted houses with them post-Katrina, and I know they are a good man.” … Ronald Doggett, the head of the Virginia chapter of EURO, said Duke participated in the conference via phone from Russia. Doggett, who attended the conference, said they did not remember hearing Scalise speak but said it would not be unusual for EURO to have contact with local officials. “If that happened, so what?” Doggett said in a phone interview Monday. “What is the big deal? There's a different standard for whites than there are for other groups. How is this really news?” … my emphasis) Scalise's defense — that they and their staff were not fully cognizant of the group's leanings and the nature of the meeting — contrasts with the local news media coverage generated by the Duke-coordinated conclave that spring. (“ House Majority Whip Scalise confirms they spoke to white supremacists in 2002 “;
The one thing this disgustingly biased story gets right is that it's almost impossible to believe that a Louisiana politician wouldn't have known the group to which they were speaking. David Duke is a household name, especially down there.
I've spoken to EURO Conferences on three separate occasions and the people there have for the most part always been top shelf, taxpaying, God-fearing conservatives. Based upon what little I've read about Scalise it would appear as though they are a decent guy who shares similar heartfelt concerns. When they were a member of the Louisiana State House they twice voted against the MLK holiday and said in a 1999 interview that they shared many of Duke's conservative views.
With that being the case, it's disappointing to watch them and the “leadership” of the GOP scurry like cockroaches with the lights turned on. Other than issuing these silly apologies and denials, Scalise has done nothing for which they should be ashamed. Frankly, people should be much more concerned if they had spoken to an anti-American group like LaRaza or AIPAC.
Furthermore, unlike those who are so quick to disparage David Duke, I actually know the man. I have known them for ten years and they have never said or done anything in my presence that raises any red flags whatsoever. They have been a guest in my home on several occasions and been nothing but a complete and total gentleman to my family. They call to check on them regularly. I say all that to show that there is a huge gap between the way they are presented and the real man as I know him.
Having said that, David Duke will be our featured guest on The Political Cesspool Radio Program this Saturday, January 3, to set the record straight. We'll give them the opportunity to speak that the rest of the mainstream media denies him. If the only things you know about Duke are the nasty (and false) things you've read about them in the establishment press, then you owe it to yourself to hear the man share with you what they really thinks about human diversity and freedom for all people. .

In case you've forgotten, Duke was once a member of the Lousiana State House of Representatives. They very nearly was elected to be a United States Senator in 1990, as the GOP nominee no less, and certainly would have won if they had simply betrayed their convictions and sold out like so many others have. They still managed to win over 600,000 votes. The very next year the Republican voters of Louisiana nominated them as the party's gubernatorial candidate.
Google Pours “Incredible” Computing Power into Antibody Drug Discovery With Adimab
Xconomy Boston —
Google is the undisputed king of Internet search and advertising, but its second act as a company might be to invent a new computer model for efficiently discovering targeted antibody drugs.
“Google is committing incredible resources to it. Incredible resources,” says Tillman Gerngross, the founder and CEO of Lebanon, NH-based Adimab. “The infrastructure alone is in the millions of dollars of raw computational power.”
Gerngross won't say exactly how much money and manpower Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) is putting into their startup, so it would be easy to dismiss this as chest-thumping from an overzealous biotech entrepreneur who's just trying to raise cash. But Gerngross isn't in that tight spot. He's the Dartmouth professor who founded GlycoFi to make faster, cheaper antibody drugs in yeast, and sold the company to Merck for $400 million in 2006. Their new company, Lebanon, NH-based Adimab, has struck deals in the past year to produce antibody drug candidates for Merck, Roche, Pfizer, and one other unnamed pharmaceutical giant. Those partnerships have given Adimab enough cash to run for the next 10 years, Gerngross says.
Google first made its interest in Adimab clear back in October. That's when its corporate venture arm led an undisclosed financing that included Polaris Venture Partners, SV Life Sciences, OrbiMed Advisors, and Borealis Ventures. I spoke with Gerngross at length about the strategy behind this investment a couple weeks ago at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. We met one day before Adimab held a board meeting not far from the Googleplex in Mountain View, CA.
What interest does a computing giant like Google have in a little antibody company like Adimab? First, a little background. Adimab is positioning itself as one of the emerging discovery engines for making targeted antibody drugs which can zero in on specific targets on diseased cells, while sparing healthy ones. The market, born in the late 1990s, now generates about $25 billion in annual sales for targeted drugs like Roche's rituximab (Rituxan) and trastuzumab (Herceptin).
Traditional antibody discovery is time-consuming and risky. Adimab has developed its advantage with a fast yeast-based model that can be used to synthesize hundreds of antibodies against a certain target in just eight weeks of work, compared with six to 18 months of labor with the traditional methods used in biotech labs around the world, Gerngross says. Once that work is done, the major drug companies still need to spend years of labor and hundreds of millions of dollars testing those drugs in animals and humans, determining which of these hundreds of candidates bind the best with the target and have the strongest effect against disease.
While Adimab represents a huge potential gain in efficiency with its faster, cheaper platform for discovering antibody drugs on the front end, Gerngross and Google are thinking about the next big revolutionary change at the early phase of the antibody discovery process.

The development puts in jeopardy Mr. Dauman's position as chief executive of Viacom and is viewed as a major coup by Shari E. Redstone, Mr. Redstone's daughter, who is the vice chairperson of Viacom and CBS as well as a member of the trust. Long ostracized by their father, Ms. Redstone has said recently that the two have patched up their relationship.
Ms. Redstone does not to see eye-to-eye with Mr. Dauman or approve of their flight attendantship of Viacom, which has suffered a 40 percent plunge in the stock price in the last year. In February, Ms. Redstone voted against Mr. Dauman's ascent to the chairperson position of Viacom.
Shortly after news of Mr. Redstone's decision emerged — first reported by Fortune — Mr. Dauman issued a statement of denunciation.
“They are a shameful effort by Shari Redstone to seize control by unlawfully using their ailing father Sumner Redstone's name and signature,” Lex Suvanto, a spokesperson for Mr. Dauman, said in a statement.
“As they know, and as court proceedings and other facts have demonstrated, Sumner Redstone now lacks the capacity to have taken these steps,” Mr. Suvanto said. “Sumner Redstone would never have summarily dismissed Philippe Dauman and George Abrams, their trusted friends and advisers for decades.”
In the statement on behalf of Mr. Redstone, Mr. Tu said: “The public statement made on Mr. Dauman's behalf attacking Mr. Redstone's capacity is disappointing and incorrect, as reflected by Mr. Dauman's own testimony given under oath less than six months ago that Mr. Redstone is as ‘engaged, attentive and as opinionated as ever.' That is exactly the Sumner Redstone who made these decisions today.”
Ms. Redstone could not be reached for comment.
The development comes a little more than a week after a trial over their mental competency was dismissed in a California court. The judge overseeing the case sided with Mr. Redstone, but made clear that they had not made a decision about whether or not Mr. Redstone was mentally competent. The judge said that a videotaped testimony of the media mogul showed that it was “not in dispute that Redstone suffers from either mild or moderate dementia.”
In the innocent, bygone days of February, President Obama told NBC News that the campaign would get negative against him, but provided this assurance: “I think that you will be able to see how we conduct ourselves in the campaign. I think it will be consistent with how I conducted myself in 2008 and hopefully how I have conducted myself as president of the United States.”
Not since Gary Hart urged reporters to follow them around because “they'd be very bored” has an assurance been more of an indictment. The Obama campaign has targeted and intimidated Republican donors on an Internet enemies list. It has engaged in the juvenile mockery of Mitt Romney's singing. It has suggested, without evidence, that Romney may have committed the felony of falsifying Federal Election Commission documents. It has speculated, without proof, that Romney has avoided paying taxes. When Joe Biden engages in racially charged hyperbole, they are awkwardly but accurately reflecting the spirit of the 2012 Obama campaign.
But the most vivid accusation (made by a closely associated PAC and embraced by the campaign itself) is that Romney's ruthless business practices were responsible for the closing of a firm, the loss of a couple's health insurance and thus the death of a woman from cancer. Except that Romney wasn't connected to the closing of the firm, the woman continued to have health insurance from another source and their cancer was diagnosed five years after the plant shut down.
Which represents the crossing of an ethical line. If the conduct of the Obama campaign team were universalized, candidates would no longer require any evidence to accuse one another of complicity in a death. To accept this as a new political norm would be to define defamation down.
Obama's defenders assure us that everyone does it. But not everyone does this. It is one thing to exploit a misstatement; another to exploit a tragedy. It is one thing to mischaracterize a federal waiver; another to accuse an opponent of being the Angel of Death.
For the Obama campaign, this is not an aberration; it is a culmination. The demonization of Romney is a main element of its strategy, pursued by Obama's closest associates and former employees, not by loosely affiliated partisan groups. Deniability is not even remotely plausible, but it doesn't remotely matter. Even when exposed, the Obama campaign never retracts, never apologizes — convinced that the news cycle will quickly erase inconvenient memories.
It seems to be working, at least for the moment. Obama's recent polling gains are mainly explainable by Romney's rising negatives, particularly among independents. Even as political journalists point out distortions by the Obama campaign, they tend to praise its boldness, coordination and momentum. And each new controversy succeeds in distracting attention from Obama's economic flight attendantship.
There is, however, some collateral damage. Obama increased the turnout of young voters in 2008 by more than 2 million over the previous election. But the level of trust by young people in public institutions, including the presidency, has been declining. Youth interest in politics has waned. Some of this is a function of understandable economic discontent. But apart from the most partisan, what young voters have had their sights and spirits lifted by the current campaign? Having introduced a generation to political idealism, Obama seems intent on taking it back.
Ronald Reagan expressed distrust of government while paradoxically improving its image and standing. Obama has placed boundless faith in government while trust in public institutions has declined to all-time lows. It is the legacy of Obama's liberalism: expanding the state while helping discredit the political process.
The Obama campaign is veering toward antinomianism. Since it regards its own motives as pure, it feels it can dispense with the normal rules of accuracy, civility and decency. So we get the political methods of Spiro Agnew combined with the moral self-regard of Woodrow Wilson. It is not an attractive mixture.
Speaking in Canton, Ohio, a week before the 2008 election, Obama said, “Some of you may be cynical and fed up with politics. A lot of you may be disappointed and even angry with your leaders. You have every right to be. But despite all of this, I ask of you what has been asked of Americans throughout our history. I ask you to believe.”
I am admittedly a sucker for rhetorical idealism. But it can't be a small thing, a typical thing, a trivial thing, to ask for belief and then betray it.

TALLAHASSEE | Half-gallon-size growlers for Florida's craft beer enthusiasts may finally become reality this year.
The Legislature is one vote away from approving a bill that would legalize 64-ounce growlers along with other changes for the beer and alcohol industry. The Senate already passed Bill 186 unanimously, and the House is expected to take up the measure in the coming days.
"It's something we've been working on for, jeez, I think four years," said Ben Davis, founder of Intuition Ale Works in Jacksonville's Riverside neighborhood. "And I'm very happy to join the other 49 states in the country where they are legal."
Florida's refusal to authorize 64-ounce growlers, the most popular size nationally, has become the punch line of many jokes.
Some Sunshine State brewers jokingly offered to sell customers two 32-ounce growlers taped together to demonstrate what they considered an absurd and outdated rule. Larger 128-ounce growlers are also legal in Florida curently.
Sen. Rob Bradley, R-Fleming Island, is one of the champions of this year's growler legislation, which is co-sponsored by the Regulated Industries Committee that they chair.
"There was consensus among many of us that this has gone on for too long and let's, No. 1, 1 free the growler and, No. 2, let's clean up all these alleged ambiguities in the law to remove the lawsuits or the threat of lawsuits going forward," Bradley said.
A legal challenged filed by beer distributors, liquor stores and the Florida Retail Federation in January attempted to shutter tasting rooms operated by craft breweries across the state. Although the challenge was dropped, it actually seemed to embolden lawmakers' resolve to get fixes written into state law, said Joshua Aubuchon, executive director and general counsel of Florida Brewers Guild, which represents about 80 craft brewers.
Senate Bill 186 allows licensed brewers to operate up to eight tasting rooms for patrons to try out beers. Most brewers operate taprooms under a tourist exemption that was written into state law to accommodate Anheuser-Busch when it operated the Busch Gardens and Sea World theme parks, but the new legislation would clarify the legality.
The bill also allows craft distilleries like those in St. Augustine and Fernandina Beach to sell more products directly to consumers. A law passed in 2013 allowed up to two bottles per year, but the new proposal would raise the cap to four.
The relative ease the growler legislation has had in the Senate compares to some bumps along the road in the House, which has two bills that authorize 64-ounce growlers.
One of them, House Bill 107, was killed in its final committee stop largely because the legislation also would have allowed grocery stores to have doorways leading directly into adjacent liquor stories. A previous version of the bill allowed grocery stores to sell hard liquor on their shelves next to food and household items, and the doorway amendment was a failed compromise to keep the measure alive.
The House's other growler bill, HB 301, is ready for a floor vote but is expected to be replaced with the Senate bill language.
With the growler issue likely drawing to a close, Davis said they hope craft brewers remain organized but shift their focus to marketing and public relations.
"There's a value for our industry, and I think that's what we need to hammer home," they said.

The United States under President Trump increasingly treat Europe as a global competitor rather than a partner and is pursuing policies that potentially hurt the interests of traditional U.S. allies, Germany's top diplomat said Tuesday.
The traditional transatlantic political architecture since World War II is beginning to "crumble," added German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel. They said the Trump administration often views Europe as "a competitor and sometimes even as an economic adversary."
Trump's campaign slogan "Make America Great Again" is "about the restoration of supposedly good old times," but it has real effects on other nations, Gabriel told the Berlin Foreign Policy Forum. The gathering was held in advance of a NATO foreign ministers meeting that begins Tuesday in Brussels and includes Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
"We see a return to borders and the supposed strength of the nation-state," Gabriel said.
They cited Trump's announcement that the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord, their undermining of the international nuclear deal with Iran, sanctions on Russia approved by Congress that could harm Germany's energy supplies and the potential U.S. designation of Jerusalem as the "undivided" capital of Israel.
Those foreign policy moves were made without much consideration of European views, Gabriel said.
[Confusion, warnings as Trump leaves open decision on Jerusalem]
If the Iran deal collapses, the risk of war and insecurity rises for Europe, they warned.
On Jerusalem, they underscored Germany's view — shared by the United States for decades — that the status of the city can be resolved only through negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, who claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state.
"Anything that aggravates the crisis is counterproductive," Gabriel said.
U.S. relations with Germany have soured under Trump, who has described Chancellor Angela Merkel's handling of migrants and refugees as a "catastrophic mistake" and has accused the country of failing to pay back "dues" to NATO. They have also strongly criticized Germany's trade imbalance with the United States.
Speaking in German, Gabriel said that Germany should adopt a tougher and more self-reliant stance that does not necessarily rely on U.S. leadership.
"Germany cannot afford to wait for decisions in Washington or to just react. We have to describe our own positions and, if necessary, also make clear to our allies where the limits of our solidarity are reached."
The foreign minister's pessimism was mirrored in public opinion polling data released at the conference by the Körber Foundation, a German think tank. Among Germans, 56 percent said the country's current relationship with the United States is somewhat or very bad, while 88 percent said Germany's defense partnership with European nations should have priority over future partnership with the United States.
The survey of 1,005 respondents was conducted Oct. 4-18 and had a margin of error of five percentage points.
Gabriel, who met with Tillerson in Washington on Iran and other issues last week, said Germany and other nations should continue to find ways to influence U.S. policy.
Trump and their advisers have set out a view that "the world is no longer a global community but an arena and also a battleground in which nations, nonstate actors and companies fight over advantages," Gabriel said.
In that arena, a country "has one and then the other as partner if that serves their own interests," they said.
They warned that Germany should not accept "a submission to U.S. politics like we have never previously seen."
Trump campaigned on promises to pull the United States out of international trade deals and other compacts they called an infringement on U.S. sovereignty.  They are deeply skeptical of international organizations and of the underlying premise that the United States has a disproportionate duty to lead or fund them.
But Gabriel said a reordered relationship between Europe and the United States was underway before Trump.
One reason, they said, is that demographic changes in the United States will soon mean that a majority of Americans have roots in Latin America, Asia and Africa rather than in Europe.
Some of last year's big hits like Drake's 'Hotline Bling' and 'Hold On (We're going home)' got us wondering if we'll ever be able to break free of ‘good-girl' ‘bad-girl' stereotypes in pop culture.
Not too long ago Robin Thicke's 'Blurred Lines' caused controversy too as the song reinforced misconceptions about consent: lyrics like 'I know you want it' suggested that 'no' might actually mean 'yes.'
Just harmless fun? Not really. Played on repeat, these songs are internalised by us, seeping into our subconscious.
And what about Bollywood tunes and Pakistani songs? We went back to our old favourites to listen closely, and its turns out that many of our own tracks broadcast the troubling message that violating personal space is ok, and that consent is optional.
1) Babia or Bibi by Sajjad Ali
Before you fly into rage let me just say this: I think Sajjad Ali is a great singer, but that doesn't mean their songs can't be critiqued by a fan who learnt all their songs by heart and copied their hairdo too.
Listening to 'Babia' the other day, I realised that although the song was upbeat and made me want to dance along... why is this person not taking their beloved's will into account? The lyrics are:
Kisi k kehne me na ana
Main they tou hon tera deewana
Saray jahan ko hai batana O bibi O bibi
Teri marzi nahi chalni o
Meri gal kyun nahi sunti
The chorus is the perfect profile of an overbearing, slightly manipulative and very jealous lover. They want to be the only one you love, which is ok, but then they says 'You have no choice in the matter' (Teri marzi nahi chalni o) which is definitely creepy, not cute.
Thankfully, Sajjad is past those times now and most of their songs appear to be about um, consensual relationships. Whew!
2) Main Na Manon Haar by Awaaz
Remember the song which was perfect for mehndis? The composition and video were perfect for a dance number back then, but even a song as memorable as 'Main Na Manon Haar' by Awaaz made me realise that ‘no means no' isn't easily understood.
The lines go like this:
Main na manon haar
Sajna, dil na manay haar
Tou chahay jis raah pe jana main bhi jaon saath
Tou chahay gi haath churana
Main na choron haath
Dunya se ghabrana kya
Pyar karay hoye hoye waah waah
Dil mera pehchana kya
De kar haath churana kya
The lyrics very blatantly say that this lover (read: stalker) will follow their love wherever they go and if they try to let go of their hand, he'll hold tight to it. Time to get that thinking cap on. It further says that once you have given someone your hand, i.e. consent to someone, you can't decide to say no in the future.
The video also shows that good guy Haroon saved the day by almost rescuing the girl who is on their way to a forced marriage. Little do they realise that she's in a lose-lose situation anyway.
3) Rangein by Ali Zafar
Disclaimer: love the tune, love the video. But it contains a line which would make any woman put their guard up.
Rangeen hai tou rangon se bhi ziada
Shoq lagti ho reh k bhi sada
Le jayen ge tujh ko utha k
Tere bina lagay na mora jiya
I can't help but feel that the idea of 'taking a girl away' (Le jayen ge tujh ko utha k) here isn't the same things as 'sweeping them off their feet.' Guys, important note: abduction isn't the best way to win a woman's heart!
However Ali's later songs don't have a creep vibe in them and we are quite thankful for that.
4) Saali by Shehzad Roy:
It's absolutely impossible to forget this song because it creatively incorporated the word 'saali' which means sister-in-law... and a few other things.
Given that there are already too many lines about 'saalis' in our society with negative connotations like the disturbing one 'saali, adhi ghar wali', this song should've turned that concept on its head but it didn't. Instead, we're reminded of how the pursuer —er, lover — does not respect their beloved's personal space and sense of autonomy.
Saali tou maani nahi
Kabhi tou manay gi
Saali pehchaani nahi
Kabhi tou janay gi
Ban k anjaani karay manmaani
Aur ye manmaani hai teri nadaani
Okay, since when did manmaani (following your own heart) make a woman a fool? And second, if the said saali does not consent to your advances, let them be, stop following their around, jeez. Shahzad has sung many songs about the idea of unrequited love, and yes, we feel their pain, but this isn't going to help matters much. At least the singer is now sticking to social causes so hopefully there won't be any other man stalking someone's saali in the future.
5) Eik Baar Chalay Aao by Saleem Javed:
This one is by far the most interesting of them all. Sung by Mehdi Hasan earlier, this song has some lines from the original ghazal and the best part? It promotes the idea of personal space!
Although if some guy was to declare their feelings in the same fashion Saleem Javed did, girls might back away slowly but remember, two to three decades ago, this was the ultimate cool.
Eik baar chalay aao
Phir aa kay chalay jana
Phir tum ko bulaye tou
Tum shauq se mat ana
These lyrics convey what personal space is and do so without being overtly creepy. The courter starts off with requesting their love interest to meet them once, and if they don't feel comfortable, they can refuse to give them the time of the day next time and he'll accept their decision.
Admittedly, the latter half of the ghazal does talk about the lover swooning over them but that has nothing to do with them thinking ''she'll come around some day'' like saali nor does it say that ''I won't let go of your hand if you have held mine'' — take note, gentlemen.
Even today, I'd bob my head to these songs (guilty as charged!) if they're ever aired on TV or I hear them on the radio because we grew up listening and dancing to them. I am sure many were inspired by Main Na Manon Haar but did we ever consider that we were perpetrating a culture of such uncomfortable lyrics becoming the norm?
At face value, they might seem very harmless but with a little nuance, these lines tell the listeners that it is okay to stalk girls if you like them, it is acceptable to violate their personal space and if a girl says yes once, they can never take it back.
Baltimore's Homicide Rate Hits New Per Capita High
Enlarge this image toggle caption Patrick Semansky/AP Patrick Semansky/AP
With six weeks left in 2015, the homicide rate in Baltimore has set a new high for the city, surpassing the previous record set in 1993. The city saw its 300th killing of the year over the weekend; since then, gun violence has killed five more people. Those homicides raised "the city's per capita homicide rate — based on the recent population estimate of 622,793 residents — to 48.97 per 100,000 residents," The Baltimore Sun reports.
The previous high was 48.77 homicides for every 100,000 residents, the newspaper adds. That was in 1993, when the city saw 353 killings. The new record is partially a result of the city's smaller population in 2015.
After years of declining homicide rates, Baltimore and many other large U.S. cities, such as Milwaukee and Houston, have seen a dramatic rise in 2015.
As NPR's Scott Simon reported this fall, "Many reasons have been suggested: gang rivalries, the supply of guns on the street and the charge that police officers may now be less aggressive because of heightened scrutiny and outrage from the public over policing in inner-city neighborhoods."
In Baltimore, the homicide rise has come as the city copes with the aftermath of riots and unrest following Freddie Gray's death in police custody. A senior Baltimore Police Department official told member station WYPR that 27 pharmacies and two methadone clinics had been looted in the days after Gray's death, putting 175,000 doses of oxycontin and other prescription drugs on the street — and setting off turf wars between drug dealers.
In August, law enforcement officials from around the U.S. gathered in Washington, D.C., to discuss the rise in crime in their cities. They talked about common traits within crime patterns, including the problems of repeat offenders, synthetic drugs and criminals' use of high-capacity gun magazines.
And as Atlanta Police Chief George Turner told NPR's Audie Cornish, another common thread emerged:
A common over-the-counter drug that tackles pain and fever may also hold keys to a longer, healthier life, according to a Texas A&M AgriLife Research scientist.
Regular doses of ibuprofen extended the lifespan of multiple species, according to research published in the journal Public Library of Science, Genetics.
"We first used baker's yeast, which is an established aging model, and noticed that the yeast treated with ibuprofen lived longer," said Dr. Michael Polymenis, an AgriLife Research biochemist in College Station. "Then we tried the same process with worms and flies and saw the same extended lifespan. Plus, these organisms not only lived longer, but also appeared healthy."
They said the treatment, given at doses comparable to the recommended human dose, added about 15 percent more to the species lives. In humans, that would be equivalent to another dozen or so years of healthy living.
Polymenis, who also is a professor in the biochemistry and biophysics department at Texas A&M University, collaborated with Dr. Brian Kennedy, the president and CEO of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato, California, along with several researchers from Russia and the University of Washington.
Ibuprofen is a relatively safe drug that was created in the early 1960s in England. It was first made available by prescription and then, after widespread use, became available over-the-counter throughout the world in the 1980s. The World Health Organization includes ibuprofen on their "List of Essential Medications" needed in a basic health system. Ibuprofen is described as a"nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug used for relieving pain, helping with fever and reducing inflammation."
Polymenis said the three-year project showed that ibuprofen interferes with the ability of yeast cells to pick up tryptophan, an amino acid found in every cell of every organism. Tryptophan is essential for humans, who get it from protein sources in the diet.
"We are not sure why this works, but it's worth exploring further. This study was a proof of principle to show that common, relatively safe drugs in humans can extend the lifespan of very diverse organisms. Therefore, it should be possible to find others like ibuprofen with even better ability to extend lifespan, with the aim of adding healthy years of life in people."
"Dr. Polymenis approached me with this idea of seeing how their cell cycle analysis corresponded with our aging studies," said Dr. Brian Kennedy, CEO at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato, California. "He had identified some drugs that had some really unique properties, and we wanted to know if they might affect aging, so we did those studies in our lab. We're beginning to find not just ibuprofen, but other drugs that affect aging, so we're really excited about it.
"Our institute is interested in finding out why people get sick when they get old. We think that by understanding those processes, we can intervene and find ways to extend human health span, keeping people healthier longer and slowing down aging. That's our ultimate goal."
Chong He, a postdoctoral fellow at Buck Institute and lead author on the paper, said looking deeper into the common drugs that target individual diseases might shed light on understanding the aging process.
"We have some preliminary data on worms that showed that this drug also extended the health span in worms," they said. "It made them live not just longer but also more healthy. You can measure the thrashing of the worms. If they're healthy, they do have a tendency to thrash a lot, and also we can measure the pumping as they swallow, because if they're healthy, the pumping is faster.
"Ibuprofen is something that people have been taking for years, and no one actually knew that it can have some benefits for longevity and health span."
The Obama administration has warned Oakland over the licensing of four giant pot farms, saying the plan is in violation of state and federal law and could trigger multiple legal actions against the city.
...
Even though pot remains illegal under federal law, the Obama Administration has taken a hands-off approach to California's medical marijuana operators so long as they are in unambiguous compliance with state law.
However, after closely studying the Oakland plan some federal officials have concluded the ordinance violates state law because it treats pot farms as distinct business entities for tax purposes, thus severing the direct connection between cultivator and patient that underpins the legal standing of a medical marijuana collective or cooperative. [California Watch]
Here's another reminder that Obama's DOJ hasn't exactly forgotten about all that naughty medical marijuana commerce going on in California.
I'm sure Oakland officials are very appreciative that these federal prosecutors are helping them interpret and comply with their own state's laws under threat of federal prosecution. It is perfectly ridiculous that federal authorities spent years pretending California's medical marijuana didn't exist, only to now find themselves feigning concern for its integrity. And once violations of state law are alleged, as Obama's policy requires, the Feds are then free to bring down the hammer with the same blind recklessness that eroded all public support for federal medical marijuana enforcement in the first place.
It would be a real shame if Oakland rolls over on this, because you couldn't ask for a better opportunity to call DOJ's bluff when it comes to Holder's pledge to "vigorously enforce" federal law in medical marijuana states. Really, does anyone think Obama is going to prosecute the City of Oakland? I highly doubt it, and it will become necessary at some point to establish that fact if we intend to further reform marijuana policies in California or anywhere else.
It's official!The Jacksonville State University Marching Southerners are headed to LSU for their season opening game. The Southerners had originally planned to go to this game, but after LSU announced their visiting band field ban, Ken Bodiford, JSU's Director, told us that they no longer would take the band to LSU if they wouldn't be able to perform.The pressure on LSU to lift the ban mounted quickly and three days later they lifted it and worked out a new plan for hosting visiting bands. The lifting of the ban was met with a huge sigh of relief from across the band world.With the ban lifted, Bodiford quickly got back to work to try and make the trip happen. Today they made the official announcement:The LSU fans are in for a real treat with the Southerners coming to town. The 400+ member band is one of the best in the country.
This time we would like to show and explain the street system of Train Fever. The community has asked for a wide range of features and we have now made a selection. Basically, we selected the features which have been requested more often than others and which are most important from a game-play perspective.
And here is the result. Train Fever features:
Straight and curved streets
Old and modern streets
City streets and rural roads
Narrow and wide streets with multiple lanes
Wood, stone and steel bridges
Tunnels
Bus lanes
Streetcar tracks
Traffic lights at crossings
The pictures above show different old streets (left) and modern streets (right). Streets can have one, two or four lanes with and without streetcar or bus lanes. There are cities and rural streets. All types can be arbitrarily combined.
Bridges can be built with wood (left), stone (right) or steel. The construction material limits vehicle speed. Bridges are built manually by the player, i.e. the player has to choose the type of the bridge, and the start and the end point. There's no automatic bridge construction (where bridges are automatically constructed everywhere a street has a certain height). We believe this way of construction is more fun and gives more control to the player.
The left image shows a rural street bridge overcoming a small valley. The right image shows a modern street crossing with traffic lights, streetcar tracks and bus lanes (red). Streets can be extended with bus lanes or streetcar tracks at any time. Cars are not allowed to drive on bus lanes. Also, traffic lights can be added to crossing if there is too much traffic.
Vehicles and people move on streets and sidewalks. In order to realize this, artificial lanes are created, which are illustrated in blue on the left side. Of course, these lanes are only visible here in order to explain how it works, they will never be visible in the game.
The image on the right illustrates bridges on multiple levels. There is no limit for constructions as long as enough space for the bridge pillars is available. You can also see railroad tracks on the right image. This is what we feature in the next update!
You can now download one the best freeware created for FS2004 which is now useable on FSX-SP2/Acceleration and Prepar3D v2.This migration has been done with Fravin agrement. In June 2013 I was contacted by one of two authors who sought a modeler who would have the patience and willingness to make a FSX version of this aircraft. It is with pleasure that I accepted and after 6 months of work here is the first release. Other changes are in progress and version 2.0 should be available by the first half of 2014This aircraft "a Cessna 150L Aerobat" which have been compared to some paywares, has been migrated on FSX. This a/c has nice animations and is a joy to fly and look at also, as the paint jobs are (visually) some of the best and most refined schemes on Cessna high-winged single-engined.I strongly advise those who do not have it to get it. It has a VC with animations, no 2D panel, and its own sound. The passenger waves a map as it flies, the doors open as do the windows on the upper part of the door, and the sunshields lower--all from within the VC only.This aircraft can be downloaded on http://frenchvfr.free.fr Have fun if you get it
Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has revealed that they did not favour demonetisation as they felt the short term economic costs associated with such a disruptive decision would outweigh any longer term benefits from it.
Rajan makes the disclosure in their latest book – I do what I do – which is a compilation of speeches they delivered on a wide range of issues as the RBI governor. Although they maintain the book is not a tell-all, the short introductions and postscripts accompanying the pieces offer fascinating insights into their uneasy relationship and differences with the present government.
“At no point during my term was the RBI asked to make a decision on demonetisation,” Rajan has said, putting to rest speculation that preparations for scrapping high-value banknotes got underway many months before Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the surprise announcement on November 8.
This is the first time the former RBI governor has spoken on demonetisation since demitting office on September 3 last year. Rajan, who now teaches economics at University of Chicago, said they chose not to speak on India for a year because they didn't want to “intrude on their successor's initial engagement with the public”.
“I was asked by the government in February 2016 for my view on demonetisation, which I gave orally. Although there might be long-term benefits, I felt the likely short-term economic costs would outweigh them,” Rajan wrote.
“I made these views known in no uncertain terms.”
They didn't elaborate on the short-term costs or the possible long-term benefits, but as the RBI governor they “felt there were alternatives to achieve the main goals.”
Latest government data showed the November 8 decision to scrap Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes, sucking out 86% of cash circulating in the system, has had a lingering impact on the economy.
The growth of GDP slowed sharply from 7% in October-December quarter to 6.1% in January-March and 5.7% in April-June, primarily because of the cash squeeze that weakened consumer spending and discouraged businesses from making new investments.
The government, however, maintains that the economic slowdown has not been entirely because of demonetisation. In an interview to Times of India, published Sunday, Rajan described the deceleration in GDP as “the costs of demonetisation upfront.”
“Let us not mince words about it – GDP suffered. The estimates I have seen range from 1 to 2 percentage points, and that's a lot of money – over Rs 2 lakh crore and may be approaching Rs 2.5 lakh crore,” they said in the interview.
“I think the people who mooted this must have thought some of it would be compensated if money didn't come back into the system,” they said referring to illegal wealth held in cash.
The government's expectation was that at least Rs 3 lakh crore worth black money held in cash won't return, significantly reducing the liability of the central bank and boosting its profits, which could be used for new investments and developmental work.
But RBI data, available now, shows 99% of the high-value notes have returned to the banking system, meaning hoarders of black money found a way to legitimise most of their dodgy cash.
“The fact that 99% has been deposited certainly does suggest that aim (of curbing black money) has not been met,” Rajan said in the interview.
Despite their reservations, Rajan wrote in their book, the RBI was asked to prepare a note, which it did and handed to the government.
The RBI note, they said, “outlined potential costs and benefits of demonetisation, as well as alternatives that could achieve similar aims. If the government, on weighing the pros and cons, still decided to go ahead with demonetisation, the note outlined the preparation that would be needed, and the time that preparation would take.”
“The RBI flagged what would happen if preparation was inadequate,” they wrote.
The government subsequently set up a committee to consider the issue. The central bank was represented on the committee by its deputy governor in charge of currency, Rajan wrote, possibly implying they did not attend these meetings.
The current leadership of the central bank could not be reached for comments on Rajan's account. Phone calls to the RBI spokesperson went unanswered.
Rajan did not detail the contents of the note RBI had submitted to the government. Modi's radical move was slammed by the opposition as ill-conceived and poorly executed. It took banks much longer than the government had expected to tide over the cash crisis. Frequent changes in cash withdrawal rules added to chaos and inconvenience that lasted far longer than the 50 days the PM had sought to restore normalcy.
Still, Modi won popular support for their move, winning a landslide victory in crucial elections in Uttar Pradesh. Most people, especially the poor, backed their decision as a frontal attack on black money.

Oregon Cormorant Slaughter Stopped Two Days in a Row
from LCA
Last Chance for Animals (LCA) and Showing Animals Respect and Kindness (SHARK) have stopped the cormorant slaughter in northern Oregon for the SECOND DAY in a row. There were high-speed chases and aversion tactics by US Fish and Wildlife Services; our presence is keeping them from coming out and killing these birds.
LCA and SHARK have been on a boat on the Columbia River following Wildlife Services agents as they attempt to stalk and gun down the double-crested cormorants of East Sand Island. The killers do not want the public to see the bloodshed — so they tried to run and hide from us, and eventually gave up and left.
The government defends the sickening cormorant cull with the flimsy excuse of protecting wild salmon, which the birds eat. But the truth is that human development, not cormorants, are to blame for the dwindling salmon population. Dams, hatcheries and other human-made constructions at the Columbia River Basin are the true threats — and the innocent birds should be left alone.

Many shortwave radio listeners know the name Leo Sarkisian, founder of the Voice of America show Music Time in Africa. For decades, Leo and their wife, Mary, traveled to every corner of Africa, lugging with them a large reel-to-reel recorder that Leo used to capture for broadcast the diverse music found across the continent. A monumental cultural record is the result. Earlier this year, at 91 years old, Sarkisian retired from VOA; they leaf their show and their wonderful library of recordings in the capable hands of radio host Heather Maxwell.
Today, Richard Harris offered an excellent radio piece they produced on Leo Sarkisian for PRI's The World–you can listen to it below or on PRI's site:
In addition, both the VOA and The Washington Post featured Leo and Mary earlier this year; both of these articles are delightful.The Washington Post article even describes Sarkisian's work as “diplomacy.” I particularly love the following description:
Long before there was ping-pong diplomacy or pere­stroika, a short, balding Armenian American was lugging an enormous reel-to-reel from village to village, sweet-talking people into singing and playing for him. […]In Africa, they socialized with presidents, military dictators, accomplished musicians and tribal villagers. They outwardly steered away from politics, but under the surface they wove a subtle diplomatic tapestry based around grooving on tunes.
That's one thing I love about shortwave radio–in all forms, in all countries, it offers a medium of accessible, lasting diplomacy–however “subtle” it may seem–for at least as long as the shortwaves continue to grace our airwaves. Of course, music is inextricably integrated into this diplomatic medium. Thank you, Leo and Mary, for a reminder of that, in the form of a truly extraordinary life's work.

I've been annoyed that David Gilmour was using the real David Gilmour's name since they were a mediocre yet smug film critic for CBC in the 80s, so I was interested to see that they have annoyed a whole new group of people. Fortunately, the controversy did produce this definitive post by Anne Thériault, which you should read now if you haven't already.
One of the striking things about their comments is that Gilmour's class wasn't “Masculinity in American Literature” or “Fiction That Might Help us to Understand Hugo Schwyzer” but “Modern Short Fiction.” The failure to include any Canadian or female authors at this point becomes particularly odd since the most accomplished author of short fiction since Chekhov happens to be both Canadian and a woman. Isn't there something odd about teaching modern short fiction with a syllabus that includes Henry Miller but not actual major writers of short fiction like, say, Munro or Moore?
Wait — a columnist professionally butthurt on behalf of Gilmour has an answer!
One of the Twitterati tweeted: “How can you idolize Anton Chekhov and not even be ‘interested' in Alice Munro?” Uh, what's one got to do with the other? Chekhov's stories actually had plots, unlike Munro's, which are just vague sketches of rather boring incidents in the lives of their uninteresting characters.
I find the idea that Munro's stories are characterized by “boring incidents” and “uninteresting characters” unfathomable, but de gustibus etc. etc. Munro plotless, however? Vague? I suspect the particular Canadian twist on right-wing identity politics in which the idea that interesting literature could be written by either women or Canadians is considered absurd may be at work here.
But this is a free country, and nobody has to take Gilmour's course if they don't like their approach.
Well, in fact, “I acknowledge that their entry level course is part of the Vic One program and is therefore mandatory if a student wants to complete the program.” But moving right along:
Far more troubling than Gilmour's literary preferences, which aren't actually troubling at all, is the prevailing attitude that they must be demonized for their tastes. Why they matter to anyone but themselves and to the students who choose to take their class is a mystery. The intolerance with which they have been greeted makes me wonder if the critics think we should be a nation of Stepford readers, all thinking alike, all liking the same things, all dutifully expressing our adulation to whomever is deemed to be the literary lion of the day. You don't like Alice Munro? Call the Mounties! A crime has been committed. Have that dissenter put in the stocks, or at least the modern-day cyber-version thereof — having streams of vile epithets hurled at them by the trolls.
Heavens to betsy, an affluent white gut be subject to angry criticism online for making sexist remarks! You might be cursed by someone in the privacy of their own home unheard by you, or in the very worst cited incident, be called a “prick” and “dinosaur” by a single person on Twitter. Truly, free speech is dead. Lakritz at least does not refer to criticism of Gilmour as a “lynching” (perhaps he's not rich enough.) Alas, the previously linked defender of Gilmour does in fact immediately leap to comparing people in positions of authority being criticized on the internets to people being tortured and killed to uphold a system of white supremacy, and can we please stop that?
No, actually, people are not that sensitive; they are that insensitive — to the idea of respect for other people's opinions, to the need for good manners and basic decency, to the concept of free speech, to the notion of civil discourse, and to the appreciation of a clash of ideas as essential for cultural and societal vibrancy.
If anything characterizes free speech and a vibrant cultural discourse it's the idea that certain ideas should be exempt from criticism.
We've encountered this kind of bad argument many times before. One thing that apparently needs to be added is that Gilmour is a teacher. Their intellectual laziness and parochialism would not be of any particular interest if they were merely influencing what books they were choosing to read on the subway. But a good teacher will generally consider such factors as “what students can reasonably expect to know” and “what students might find particularly interesting or worthy of engagement.” In part, this means some measure of critical distance, and ability to transcend one's hobbyhorses. To spend fourteen weeks attacking people who believe that presidential rhetoric is the most important force shaping American politics and calling the resulting course “Introduction to American Government” would be grossly irresponsible. Spending a whole semester reading Ruth Bader Ginsburg's gender discrimination opinions is fine if the course is “The 14th Amendment Jurisprudence of Ruth Bader Ginsburg” but not if the course is “American Constitutional Development.”
Which returns us to one of the points Thériault makes so effectively. Gilmour says they can only “passionately” teach writers whose particular obsessions and perspectives mirror their own. But they never seems to doubt the universality of the Important Male Novelists they teach and that their students will be able to engage with them. I mean, what 20-year-old woman hasn't experienced an existential crisis of such elephantine masculine self-pity that they become obsessed with sexually exploiting students 30 years their junior? Among its other problems, Gilmour's theory of education and literature is self-refuting.
The House heard a bill on April 14 that could make it harder for Asian women in America to exercise their right to an abortion. The bill is called the Prenatal Discrimination Act and is commonly referred to as PRENDA. If passed, PRENDA would force doctors to deny service to any woman they suspect is seeking an abortion because of the sex of their fetus and to report that woman to the police.
PRENDA sponsors say the bill would combat sex-selective abortion, in which mothers choose to abort female fetuses in favor of having sons. The practice, which is common in China and India, is also happening in the US, they claim.
But opponents say that the bill is based on stereotypes, not facts. “PRENDA threatens women's health and perpetuates the racist myth that Asian American Pacific Islander families do not value girls,” Mirian Yeung, the executive director of the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum, said in a press release. The proposed law would interfere with the doctor-patient relationship if passed, they said.
“It is a nightmare. This is a piece of legislation that would impose criminal penalties on providers and limit the reproductive choices of women of color and all women,” California Representative Judy Chu (D) told The Guardian.
A study conducted on data from the 2000 US Census found that the gender ratio of US-born children of Chinese, Indian, and Korean parents skewed male at a greater rate than the general population. But a more recent study that used data from 2007 to 2011 found the opposite to be true: Overall, Chinese, Indian and Korean parents in the US have more female children than do American parents of European descent.
Congress has heard the case for outlawing sex and race selective abortion before. An earlier version of PRENDA was introduced by Arizona Representative Trent Franks (R) in 2011. It failed 246 to 168 in the House in 2012, but eight states have passed their own versions of the bill. Currently, sex-selective abortion is illegal in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Kansas, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Oklahoma.
Divers experience rare swim with five-metre whale shark off North Stradbroke Island
Updated
Sorry, this video has expired Video: Whale shark spotted off North Stradbroke Island (ABC News)
Divers off south-east Queensland's North Stradbroke Island have been treated with a rare and spectacular sighting — a whale shark.
The five-metre long juvenile male was spotted off Point Lookout on Sunday.
University of Queensland marine biologist Dr Kathy Townsend said it was only the second confirmed sighting of a whale shark off Straddie in about 10 years.
"Normally whale sharks you find really commonly on the west coast, so places around Ningaloo and things like that. However, here on the east coast we very rarely see them," they said.
"I think the last time we spotted one at Straddie was somewhere between five and 10 years ago.
"When they do see them, they generally just see them in passing, but this particular youngster spent at least three hours today in the water with divers."
Diver Chris Atkins said it was an exciting moment.
"Just amazing that whale shark. That's four times this morning I've seen him. Just fantastic on the east coast of Australia," they said.
Dr Townsend said they believed something different was luring the plankton-eating creature closer to shore this year.
"The difference this year is something has changed with the currents that encourage not only the whale sharks, but we've also had manta rays hanging around unseasonably long this year," they said.
"So, there's something that's going on that's encouraged them to come much closer to North Stradbroke Island than we normally see them.
"It wouldn't surprise me a great deal if the plankton biomass was the thing that was also encouraging the whale sharks to also come into this region, because if there's a lot of food around they will actually come in and seek it out."

Is technology, made to better our lives, killing us? Kids have stopped playing on trees, and this isn't healthy, reported TreeHugger's Lloyd last week, citing a UK study that found more and more kids staying inside (playing on computers and video games) are avoiding risky play.
According to the study, kids need the adventure of "risky" play: "Risk-taking increases the resilience of children," said one researcher. "It helps them make judgments," said another. They list examples of risky play that should be encouraged including fire-building, den-making, watersports, paintballing, boxing and climbing trees.
That story fits in nicely with new research reported by Israeli researchers, and may give us some insight into why pedestrians and cyclists are getting hit by cars when hooked into their iPods; and why so many people are still dying from car accidents. Apparently, explains Arnon Lotem a researcher at Tel Aviv University, our ancient instincts don't meet the decision-making needs of a modern world.
Take for example driving. The traffic light ahead of you has turned yellow. Do you gun it and speed through the intersection, trusting that others will wait for their green, or are you the type who will slow down and wait your turn? The answer depends more on experience than personality, according to Lotem, a behavioral ecologist who reported their research in Nature.
Lotem found that modern people have adopted risk-taking behaviors similar to those of animals like rats and bees. And this behavior, Prof. Lotem says might not prepare humankind for the types modern dangers we face every day -- like crossing the street, accepting a high-risk mortgage, driving on the freeway, or flying a plane.
While our risk-taking behavior had its advantages when we were living as cave-dwellers, it poses new and potentially dangerous challenges in our modern technology-driven world: "People want to know how people make decisions, whether it's how you drive your car, or whether to invest in a mortgage. It's important to understand when and how we make those decisions, to understand the type of errors people are prone to make," they say.
"What we have found is that people make decisions based on what option 'appears' to be better most of the time. Under conditions in the natural world this would be the best strategy, but in modern life it has nothing do with the real inherent risks," they add, citing our individual responses to yellow lights.
A Calculated Risk, You Do the Math
People are aware of the actual risks when driving through a light at an intersection, but unless they've already had a brush-with-death, says Lotem, or a brush-with-a-traffic-cop, the perceived risk remains low. This is because in most cases nothing happens to the risk-taker. "You save one minute, but you can lose everything. People don't do the math," they say.
Lotem's study found that, presented with simple decision-making stimuli, people are not analyzing the complete situation based on logical rationales or statistics. Instead, they appear to be making decisions based on simple strategies for coping in nature, based mainly on personal experience.
This tactic might have worked fine for surviving the jungle or desert, but did not evolve to survive the modern world. "We've evolved to be afraid of snakes, but not traffic lights," they say.
The results of Lotem's research may also be used by economists, politicians and psychologists who need to know when people will take risks. A wider understanding of this phenomenon can affect business decisions, the economy — and hopefully the number of road accidents in America each year.
The study's participants also included a team of scientists from the Technion Israel Institute of Technology and The Faculty of Agriculture of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

Drought-stricken farmers are still waiting for help from Congress. House GOP has issues to resolve
After the escapism of Tampa, House Republicans face two quick reality checks this month: funding the government past Sept. 30 and extending the safety net for farmers amid the worst drought in a generation.
Indeed, September's song is very much this disconnect between the bold rhetoric of the Republican convention and the grittier backroom deals and problems facing Congress before it rushes back home for the elections.
Story Continued Below
“We choose to limit government,” Paul Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairperson and the new vice presidential nominee, told Tampa's delegates. But nonemergency appropriations will go up — not down — by $8 billion in the six-month stopgap bill now taking shape in the House.
Negotiators worked through the weekend in hopes of filing the measure late Monday or Tuesday. Select priority accounts will get plus-ups, but to speed things along, billions were expected to be distributed through an across-the-board formula — a remarkable turn for Republicans.
Farmers won't have the same luck.
Hundreds are slated to rally Wednesday at the Capitol, demanding action on a long delayed, five-year farm bill. But August has passed with no real progress, and coming out of Tampa the overwhelming sense is that the fix is in — for what could be described as a monumental legislative failure by this Congress.
The Senate passed its farm bill in June. The House Agriculture Committee followed within weeks. But two months later, the GOP leadership is paralyzed, torn between doing something for the rural economy vs. trumpeting the party's attacks on food stamps as a new form of welfare under President Barack Obama.
Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) seems most intent on stalling for time until after the election and then pushing through a one-year extension of current policy in the turmoil of the lame-duck session. “A ship trying to sail on yesterday's wind” was Ryan's artful putdown of Obama. Yet , House Republicans aren't even allowing their farm bill out of the harbor.
A short-term disaster aid package may still be salvaged, but House Agriculture Committee Chairman Frank Lucas (R-Okla.) is sounding grim. “I don't know that there's been a huge amount of movement,” they told POLITICO. And the same pessimism is echoed by Minnesota Rep. Collin Peterson, the ranking Democrat on the panel.

FINAL STATS | HIGHLIGHTS
MIAMI (June 17, 2017) – The Jacksonville Armada FC fell to the Miami FC Saturday Night at Riccardo Silva Stadium. Miami put four goals away and Jacksonville was unable to answer, leading to a final score of 4-0.
Jacksonville held the second place seat behind Miami heading into week 13 of the North American Soccer League Spring Season, and sat five points away from Miami making this a crucial match to win. The stakes were heightened Saturday after the New York Cosmos leapfrogged to second place after a win Friday night.
However, the Armada FC's performance proved not to be enough to take the three points needed.
“We were superb tonight against a very clinical Miami team,” said head coach Mark Lowry. “We possessed the ball very well and gave Miami a lot of problems. Unfortunately they capitalized on their four chances, and we didn't.”
Miami held most of the possession in the first half and took the lead in the 15th minute. Kwadwo Poku first hit the post, but Stéfano Pinho found the rebound and the goal.
Vincenzo Rennella was next to find the net for Miami when they fired a shot from the left side of the box past Armada FC goalkeeper Kyle Nasta. The teams went into halftime with Jacksonville trailing by two.
The Armada FC came back in the second half and gained momentum.
Jemal Johnson had an early chance shortly after play resumed, but their shot was blocked and went out of play.
Jacksonville received another opportunity in the 75th minute after J.C. Banks was fouled in the penalty area. The team was awarded an indirect free kick but it was cleared out by Miami.
The next goal for Miami did not come until the 79th minute. Rennella received a through ball from Ariel Martinez and put the ball in the back of the net for a brace.
Ariel Martinez scored Miami's final goal in the 85th minute. They fired a shot from just outside the penalty area to bring the final score to 4-0.
“The score line was no way a reflection of the game, so moving forward won't be a tough task,” said Lowry. “Myself and the players take a lot of heart from our style of play, and we refuse to surrender it. Tonight we just couldn't get the goals our possession and territory deserved.”
The Jacksonville Armada FC will now return home after a two-game road stint to play Puerto Rico FC for the first time this year on Sunday, June 25. Kickoff is scheduled for 6 p.m. at Hodges Stadium and the club will be celebrating Puerto Rican Heritage Night. Tickets and more information can be found on ArmadaFC.com/tickets or by calling 844-2-ARMADA.

Burger King has extended an olive branch to longtime rival McDonald's -- an offer to collaborate on a bold new hybrid frankenburger called the McWhopper. But McDonald's has said no.
"Good morning, McDonald's," Burger King said in a full-page "open letter" ad in the New York Times. "We come in peace. In fact, we come in honor of peace. We know we've had our petty differences, but how about we call a ceasefire on these so-called 'burger wars'?"
Burger King proposed that the two chains combine "the tastiest bits of your Big Mac and our Whopper, united in one delicious, peace-loving burger" that they' would sell on Peace Day, September 21.
The proceeds would be donated to Peace One Day, a nonprofit that provides educational resources to thousands of schools in 131 countries.
"All we need from you is a few McDonald's crew members to help combine your ingredients with ours," said Burger King in its ad.
McDonald's (MCD) CEO Steve Easterbrook replied on Facebook that it was a "great idea" and "inspiration for a good cause." But they shot down the idea of a McWhopper and offered a much more vague proposal.
"We love the intention but think our two brands could do something bigger to make a difference," they said. "We commit to raise awareness worldwide, perhaps you'll join us in a meaningful global effort?"
Related: Chipotle wants to hire 4,000 in one day
Easterbrook also urged Burger King to "acknowledge that between us there is simply a friendly business competition and certainly not the unequaled circumstances of the real pain and suffering of war."
They signed off with, "We'll be in touch. P.S. A simple phone call will do next time."
Burger King proposed selling the McWhopper at a pop-up location location in Atlanta, which it says is the halfway point between its headquarters in Miami and McDonald's Chicago headquarters.
The Whopper, which Burger King refers to as "America's favorite burger," is a quarter pound (pre-cooked patty weight) of "savory flame-grilled beef" with tomatoes, lettuce, mayonnaise, ketchup, pickles and sliced onions on a sesame seed bun. It is 650 calories with 37 grams of fat and 1.5 grams of trans fat.
McDonald's describes the Big Mac as "a double layer of sear-sizzled 100% pure beef mingled with special sauce" with American cheese, lettuce, minced onions, pickles on a sesame seed bun. It is 540 calories with 28 grams of fat and 1 gram of trans fat.

Sometime in June, a North Korean pilot taxied their supersonic fighter to the runway for a routine training flight. The pilot, one of North Korea's military elite, powered up their engines and took off with a roar from Koksan Air Base. Moments later, their plane tumbled out of the sky.
It was the second North Korean MiG-19 crash this summer, and the third in 2014. The mighty North Korean People's Army is crumbling. Is the ruling Kim dynasty next?
In the aftermath of the Korean War, North Korea built up a large military. The goal was to reunify North and South Korea — by force if necessary. The Soviet Union, happy to tie down American troops garrisoning South Korea, lavishly outfitted the North Korean military with tanks, artillery, submarines, fighters, and other military hardware.
The Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, and military aid to Kim Il Sung, grandfather of current ruler Kim Jong-un, dried up to virtually nothing. The new Russian government was not interested in socialist charity and wanted cash for weapons. The North Korean Army began to feel the pinch.
Nearly 25 years later, the North Korean People's Army, Navy, and Air Force are relics of a different era. Nearly everything is obsolete. North Korean tanks and armored fighting vehicles are up to 50 years old. This summer, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was photographed onboard an old Romeo-class submarine, an antiquated design first produced in the 1950s. The North Korean Air Force is only slightly better off; its newest fighter jets are now 25 years old (most are closer to 50).
Not only is the equipment obsolete, it's becoming unusable. Late last year during naval exercises, two North Korean People's Navy patrol boats sank within days of each other, killing tens of North Korean sailors. On June 24, a helicopter exploded in midair.
One major problem: North Korean equipment is so old nobody makes spare parts anymore. For years the military has cannibalized some equipment in order to keep the rest running. The fact that three MiG-19s have crashed in the span of seven months is a strong indication that cannibalization is no longer working and entire types of equipment are overdue for a trip to the junk heap.
Kim Jong-un themselves was considered responsible for the MiG crashes. Kim had allegedly pushed the military to train hard, countering U.S.-South Korean military exercises that were going on at the same time. The subsequent crashes created the opposite impression: instead of projecting strength, the North Korean military now appears very weak. Could Kim Jong-un find themselves the victim of a military coup?
As part of a totalitarian regime, the North Korean military enjoys political power and influence far beyond what Western militaries do. Dictators often find themselves wooing and feting the generals running the military, since they alone have the power to overthrow them. North Korea is no different, and the national policy of Songun, or "military first," has meant the armed forces have first priority over national resources. Songun is why the North Korean People's Army is as large as it is, but it's also precisely why the military is falling apart.
The prioritization of the military over civilian sectors has run the North Korean economy into the ground. To give you an idea of the scope of the failure, North Korea has a population of 24 million and trillions in untapped natural resources. Despite that, North Korea's gross domestic product (the total worth of goods and services produced by the country) is roughly the same as North Dakota's, a state with only 700,000 people.
After decades of living beyond its means, the North Korean leadership is trapped: Even if it were to reverse Songun, the military wouldn't be better off in the short term — things would get much worse before the economy could afford a military even a tenth the current size. And of all of Kim Jong-un's options, drastically shrinking the size of the army is probably the one that would guarantee a revolt by their generals.
Nevertheless, a military coup is unlikely. One party rule and the suppression of internal dissent means there is a lack of a credible alternative for the military to back. The military could impose a junta of senior military officers, but thanks to Songun, it already is getting the best deal it can.
Like the Kim regime itself, the military simply has no good choices. The North Korean People's Army will likely continue to back the Kim regime and march into oblivion.
How To: Lose Your Frat Boy Look
Looking For A Job This Fall? It's Time To Ditch That Frat Boy Look.

Recent college graduate? With September around the corner, it's time to put summer partying behind you and buckle down on that all-import job search. But first we're calling all former frat boys out: It's time to grow up. Your first-year student-hazing, bar-crawling, beer-pong-playing days are over. And while you've managed to leap beyond those ivy-covered walls into a big boy job in the real world, your sense of personal style remains stuck somewhere between pledge paddling and a weekend binge fest. And for those of you who will be saying goodbye to your college campuses soon enough — or are still looking for a job — you need to take a hard look at yourself because your appearance will influence your ability to succeed in this next chapter of your life.
Sure, we're aware the Greek system is worth more than an afternoon kegger — there were a few fundraisers, blood drives and weekend reading circles with blind kids thrown in there for good measure. But all of that can be accomplished in Birkenstocks and a baseball cap. Now, you're entering the next stage of life, which requires a few changes.
Lose the cheap jewelry
Don't wear shorts
No more freebie tees
Steer clear of reliable retail friends
Knock it off with the novelty necklaces, frat boy. Dog tags, puka shells and anything hemp needs to be filed under Pi Chi Buh-Bye. Real men know that men's jewelry should be simple and understated. Feed your need for bling with a single statement piece like a bold watch When it comes to outfitting the lower level, frat boy fashion tends toward big, beefy cargo shorts — the kind that could store a month's supply of Ramen on one side and a six-pack on the other. Shorts should be slimmer, unpleated and never go below the knee. The final rule of thumb: Wear them sparingly. Beaches and boats are fine. A night out with the brothers? Not so much.A free trip to Tahiti? Heaven. A free day? Awesome. Buy one, get one free? Good deal. A free T-shirt, however, is another story. And frat boys certainly have their fair share of freebie tees — everything from Greek-lettered graphic ones to intramural sports shirts. They're great for the gym, sleeping and working with heavy machinery. Otherwise, you're at a point where you need to upgrade to a T-shirt that costs some cash. And please, don't go buy something with a (not-so) witty slogan scrawled across the chest. Those can be thrown into the fire too.When it comes to losing your frat boy look, you need to acknowledge that you've come of age and are a few years past prime for Abercrombie and American Eagle. Their graphic tees and logoed polo shirts have served their purpose. Now, it's time to exit your selection of standby stores and branch out. Fortunately, mature mega-brands do exist. J.Crew is always a safe bet, but more exclusive lines like little-known Martin + Osa (brought to you by your buddies at American Eagle) are within your clothing comfort zone and budget.

Steven Clarke could be the beneficiary of a radical shift in thinking by the B.C. Lions.
Coming off a torn anterior cruciate ligament, the defensive back was moving well and turned some heads at the club's recent mini-camp when they lined up at free safety some eight months after the serious knee injury.
“It's a great opportunity,” Clarke said following one of last week's on-field sessions. “I'm definitely having fun with it.”
The free safety position in B.C. has been reserved for a Canadian in recent years, but head coach and general manager Wally Buono said they have no issue using an American if it helps the Lions improve on their CFL-low nine interceptions from 2016.
“The one thing that we didn't do enough of last year is we didn't get enough turnovers,” said Buono. “I'm not putting the blame on one individual, but we've got to find ways to be able to do that.
“If we have to use coverages that maybe allow us to use more of a cover guy then so be it.”
Mike Edem was signed to play free safety last season, but the hard-hitting Brampton, Ont., product had just two picks in 17 games.
The Lions also drafted Montreal's Anthony Thompson with an eye toward developing them into another Canadian safety, however there appears to be a change in thinking heading into training camp, which starts at the end of the month in Kamloops.
Whether the shift in philosophy actually takes hold could come down to whether or not the Lions start an extra Canadian on the offensive line or at wide-side corner, in turn opening up additional spots for U.S.-born players elsewhere.
“I'm comfortable in improving our football club,” said Buono. “We're going to have different options to look at.”
A native of Lauderdale Lakes, Fla., Clarke started 15 games for B.C. in 2015 and rejoined the Lions last spring after a brief stint with the NFL's Tennessee Titans.
The 26-year-old regained their starting role when fellow halfback T.J. Lee was lost for the year with a torn Achilles tendon in July, but would themselves go down with their injury just a month later.
“Really frustrated, because as a player you know you had a big off-season,” said Clarke. “You worked really, really hard.
“Injuries happen, but you just have to fight back and get ready for the next opportunity.”
While the Lions had a good overall statistical campaign on defence, tying for the league lead in sacks and allowing the fewest combined yards in 2016, the lack of interceptions was a glaring problem.
“Nowhere close to being enough,” said Clarke, who has one pick in 22 career games. “That's one of the things we've talked about this year — putting ourselves in position to get more interceptions (by) challenging routes and jumping more routes.”
Clarke said that along with Lee and Ronnie Yell, a corner who broke their foot in late August, he's looking forward to getting back into a secondary that was decimated last season and as a result often seemed to have a bend-but-don't-break mentality.
“We've definitely got a big chip on our shoulder,” said Clarke, who declared their knee 100 per cent healthy thanks to some rigorous training. “All three of us are competing to see who's going to be the comeback player of the year.
“We're getting after it.”
But it's also a unit that will be without veteran Ryan Phillips for the first time in 12 seasons after they were released in February before signing with the Montreal Alouettes.
“It's definitely going to be a big difference,” said Clarke. “We all look up to them as a big brother.
“It's going to be a big impact without him. We just have to keep the ball rolling.”
And hopefully intercept a couple more balls in the process.
Two years ago, the Central Intelligence Agency announced it was creating a center to analyze the geopolitical ramifications of "phenomena such as desertification, rising sea levels, population shifts and heightened competition for natural resources."
But whatever work the Center on Climate Change and National Security has done remains secret.
In response to National Security Archive scholar Jeffrey Richelson's Freedom of Information Act request, the CIA said all of its work is "classified."
"We completed a thorough search for records responsive to your request and located material that we determined is currently and properly classified and must be denied in its entirety," (.pdf) Susan Viscuso, the agency's information and privacy coordinator, wrote Richelson.
Richelson, in a Thursday telephone interview from Los Angeles, said the CIA has not released anything about its climate change research, other than its initial press release announcing the center's founding.
"As far as I know, they have not released any of their products or anything else," Richelson said. "There was a statement announcing its creation and that has been pretty much it."
Steven Aftergood, who directs the Federation of American Scientists Project on Government Secrecy, blasted the CIA's response to Richelson.
The CIA's position, they said, means all "the center's work is classified and there is not even a single study, or a single passage in a single study, that could be released without damage to national security. That's a familiar song, and it became tiresome long ago."
When the center was announced, the CIA said it would become "a powerful asset recognized throughout our government, and beyond, for its knowledge and insight."
President Barack Obama also promised a transparent administration, which they might not be living up to. For instance, in 2009, the Obama administration played the national security card to hide details of the controversial Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement that is still being negotiated across the globe.
What's more, consider the 33-page report the White House issued Friday, "The Obama Administration's Commitment to Open Government." (pdf)
Aftergood said the report "downplays or overlooks many of the administration's principal achievements in reducing inappropriate secrecy. At the same time, it fails to acknowledge the major defects of the openness program to date. And so it presents a muddled picture of the state of open government, while providing a poor guide to future policy."
In any case, the Center for Climate Change and National Security might not continue much longer "because of pressure for intelligence budget cuts and resistance from conservative lawmakers."

SAN FRANCISCO -- Chris Coghlan is the latest player to become seriously injured while celebrating.
The Florida Marlins left fielder is headed for the disabled list with a torn meniscus in their left knee and might need surgery.
The reigning NL Rookie of the Year's injury was revealed in an MRI exam Monday. They were hurt Sunday while delivering a pie in the face to teammate Wes Helms following the pinch hitter's bases-loaded single in the 11th inning of a 5-4 win over Atlanta on Sunday. There will be no more such celebratory antics by Florida, manager Edwin Rodriguez said.
"It's very humbling when the game is taken away and you don't realize it because you play every day," Coghlan said. "If you ever get injured, you want to do it while you're out there competing, not when you're celebrating. Emotions get the best of you, you're excited. There's nothing wrong with that but be a little smarter when you're celebrating a win."
If they need surgery, Coghlan said, they likely will be sidelined six to eight weeks. Coghlan was batting .268 with five home runs and 28 RBIs.
During their February 28 speech to a Joint Session of Congress, President Trump denounced violence, saying: “In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone.”
Singer and actor Bette Midler tried to counter Trump's statement by tweeting a link to Chicago Tribune story which showed that nearly 800 people were murdered in Chicago.
In other words, Trump was talking about the overall number of shooting victims — fatal and non-fatal combined — when they said “more than 4,000.” But in their eagerness to make it look like Trump was exaggerating, Midler tweeted that just under 800 people were murdered. They were blissfully unaware that they were comparing apples to oranges, and the sad part is that if they had listened to Trump's whole statement they would have noticed they addressed the raging homicide problem separately.
Trump's full statement: “In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone — and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.”
Midler's tweet:
Trump says that 4000 people were shot in Chicago in 2016. Chicago Tribune says 2016 ended with 762 homicides. https://t.co/f0AoJBDexV — Bette Midler (@BetteMidler) March 1, 2017
Gun-controlled Chicago ended 2016 with nearly 4,400 shooting victims and nearly 800 homicides, and the city is already on pace to have more shootings and homicides this year than last. For example, there were 466 shooting victims during the first two months of 2016 but more than 517 shooting victims during the same time period in 2017. There were 101 homicides during the first two months of 2016 but more than 103 during the same time period in 2017.
Trump is correct. Midler jumped the gun.

Rasool was detained in Turkey on August 27, while reporting in the country's southeast with VICE News colleagues Jake Hanrahan and Philip Pendlebury, and charged with working for a terrorist organization — an entirely baseless and absurd accusation.
A video published at the weekend by the RTBF station — for which Rasool also worked while in Turkey and Iraq — shows a reporter shouting a question in the direction of Erdoğan as they walk towards their car. "Mr. Erdoğan — why is Mohammed Rasool still in prison in Turkey?" they say, as the Turkish leader looks over before disappearing into their vehicle.
The incident, all caught on camera , caused a storm in Belgium and prompted the European Federation of Journalists to report the Belgian government to the European Council for "intimidation."

Rasool was detained in Turkey on August 27, while reporting in the country's southeast with VICE News colleagues Jake Hanrahan and Philip Pendlebury, and charged with working for a terrorist organization — an entirely baseless and absurd accusation.
While Hanrahan and Pendlebury were released on September 3 and have since returned to the UK, everyone at VICE News remains extremely concerned for Rasool and calls on the Turkish authorities to release them immediately. The campaign to free them has attracted international attention.
A voiceover on the RTBF video explains that the encounter followed a press conference during an official visit to Belgium by Erdoğan earlier this month, at which journalists had not been permitted to ask questions.
Immediately afterward, a Turkish embassy official reprimands a representative of Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel for having let the journalist ask the question.
The Belgian government representative then tells RTBF, which is still filming, that it is not allowed to film and that they will complain to the director of the station. Michel's communications director Frédéric Cauderlier then takes the journalists aside and threatens them, telling them that if the footage is aired, "we have a grave situation" and that there will be "consequences."
François Mazure, the host-editor of the Belgian television show 7 à la Une, which published the video, said although there was a typical "love/hate relationship" between the press and the government in Belgium, the station had been surprised by how the government had reacted.

"The tone of the Belgian government spokesperson this time was really harsh," Mazure said. "The prime minister reprimanded their spokesperson, because our video got massive attention in Belgium. We had 400,000 views — which is huge for a small country like Belgium."
Michel later told a Belgian news agency they had told off Cauderlier for using "unacceptable words" towards RTBF.
"Rasool is part of the RTBF family," Mazure added. "We are all very concerned about the destiny of Mohammed.  They are a true professional, always efficient and neutral. We were their employer, so we really do care about their fate."
The fifth and last accused to be arrested for the gang-rape of an 18-year-old Mulund telephone operator in the Shakti Mills compound, Ashfaque Shaikh, was using a network of friends to keep them informed about the police search parties while they were on the run.The NM Joshi Marg police, who investigated the August 22 gang-rape of the 22-year-old photojournalist in the same mill compound, had picked up Ashfaque on August 25 but released them after the woman said they were not among their rapists.Once they were released, Ashfaque, 27, worried that their friends may rat on him, took off to Chennai with a sex worker from Kamathipura before moving to Guntur in Andhra Pradesh. All the while, they were constantly in touch with their friends in Mumbai. But they never used their mobile phone, which they had discarded soon after they were released from police custody. They only used public pay phones. Once their friends told them the August 22 case has been solved, they returned to Mumbai on September 5. After they got off the train at Dadar, they sent the sex worker back to Kamathipura and asked them to keep them informed of the police activity.“He then got information that we were looking for them for the July 31 rape case,” said a senior Crime Branch officer. “He immediately fled to Ajmer. We kept a watch on their girlfriend. We also noticed there was a small boy who ran errands and received some five to six calls every day. The boy always handed over the phone to the sex worker. We knew it was Ashfaque on the other end and traced them to Ajmer. But they soon ran away to Vadodara. They then told the sex worker that they will come back to Mumbai. We set a trap for them and arrested them on Saturday.”Ashfaque has two children and their family lives in Darbhanga, Bihar. They were produced at the Esplanade court on Sunday and was sent to judicial custody till September 19.
The Bernie Sanders campaign has set up shop on the city's West End in a fairly interesting spot.

We can't make this stuff up; we really can't.
The address of the Ithaca field office of the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign is 609 W. Clinton St.
Yes. Clinton Street.
The Clinton West Plaza, to be exact. The plaza, where the campaign is headquartered, is named for the street on which it sits.
Clinton Street is named after Dewitt Clinton, governor of New York state at the time Tompkins County and Ithaca were founded. The street has no liberal ties — this governor, after all, was a member of what is considered the first iteration of the Republican Party — and in Ithaca, at the time, naming streets after past governors of New York was common practice.
Today, the connotations of the Clinton name take on something a little different. Namely, the moniker of the candidate Sanders finds themselves up against this primary season.

It's not the first example of Clinton appropriation by Sanders. As some may recall, the presidential candidate was for a brief while a popular professor of sociology at Hamilton College, located in — you guessed it — Clinton, New York.
Campaign workers at the Sanders Ithaca office acknowledged the coincidence but said it is an unintended, if hilarious, stroke of irony. The site was selected because it's spacious and a great location, with ample parking and right off state Route 13.
"We'll set up anywhere," Sanders supporter and volunteer Bernie Fetterly said. "Anywhere and everywhere. Even on Clinton Street."

Twitter Goes Dark In Turkey Hours After The Country's PM Threatened To “Wipe Out” The Service
After the Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdoğan promised that they would “wipe out” Twitter after it apparently ignored court orders asking the site to remove certain corruption allegations, the service has gone dark in the country.
The situation is developing: a site that lets the public track decisions made by the courts over Internet communications indicates that today the “İstanbul Cumhuriyet Başsavcılığı (TMK 10. Maddesi İle Görevli) has been implemented by Telekomünikasyon İletişim Başkanlığı” — it's the most recent of four Twitter-related decisions made by the court.
A Twitter spokesperson tells us, “We're looking into this now.” Twitter's @policy and (very little used) @twitterTurkey accounts are also providing updates.
So far, that has offered users a way of posting tweets by way of SMS messages:
Turkish users: you can send Tweets using SMS. Avea and Vodafone text START to 2444. Turkcell text START to 2555. — Twitter Public Policy (@Policy) March 20, 2014
According to earlier reports, the prime minister has been threatening to go after social media sites in their battle to respond to allegations being made on them — specifically Twitter and YouTube — linking them to a corruption scandal. The comments have become increasingly heated as the country gears up for an election on March 30.
“We will wipe out all of these,” they said at a rally in reference to Twitter and other sites where people have been speaking out against him.
This is not the first time that Twitter has been caught in political crossfire and shut down in the process. It was blocked in Egypt in 2011, Pakistan in 2012, and China in 2009, among many other incidents. In France, the government has been battling long and hard with the site over how much influence it should have in forcing it to take down certain tweets and accounts if they violate French law, which sometimes runs counter to wider freedom of speech arguments.
Ilhan Tanir, a Turkish analyst based in Washington who was one of the first to highlight the block, has also published what they say is a statement from the U.S. State Department over the block:
“As we have previously stated, we remain very concerned by any suggestion that social media sites could be shut down. Democracies are strengthened by the diversity of public voices,” the statement reads. “An independent and unfettered media is an essential element of democratic, open societies, and crucial to ensuring official transparency and accountability.”
Far-left MSNBC host Joy Reid appears to be so excited about the possibility of Democrats taking control of Congress in the 2018 midterms, she's already started a segment to promote Democratic candidates almost a year and a half before the general election even takes place. On Sunday's AM Joy, Reid ended the show with the "first installment of a new segment" as they showed no subtlety in naming it "Flip This House."
When asked by Reid if they would support impeachment against President Donald Trump, New Jersey Democratic congressional candidate Linda Weber credited MSNBC with making their support impeachment, and went on to question Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan's Christian faith.
Near the end of the show, Reid introduced the segment:
The 2018 midterm elections are still more than a year away, but the Democrats are already hoping to flip this house. To do that, they need to take 24 seats from the Republican majority. Midterm elections have historically not gone well for the President's party -- most recently in 2006, 2010, and 2014. But these losses can be even more big league for Presidents with low approval ratings. A Quinnipiac poll finds that more than 54 percent of voters would prefer a Democratic-controlled House while just 38 percent said that they want Republicans to remain in charge. It's the widest margin Quinnipiac has ever recorded.
They then added:
One of these seats the Dems are targeting is in New Jersey's Seventh Congressional District -- a district that Hillary Clinton won narrowly in 2016. And, joining me now for the first installment of a new segment we call "Flip This House," is Linda Weber, a banking executive and a Democrat who is looking to take the seat.
After spending the first few questions talking about the New Jersey district's voting patterns, and Republican incumbent Leonard Lance's record of not always voting with other Republicans, Reid brought up the subject of impeachment as they posed: "If you were in Congress and Democrats took control of the House of Representatives, and there was a move to impeach President Donald Trump, would you support it?"
After declaring, "Absolutely, 100 percent," Reid followed up: "Based on what?" The New Jersey Democrat then implicated MSNBC in their views:
<<< Please support MRC's NewsBusters team with a tax-deductible contribution today. >>>
Based on listening the other day on MSNBC to someone read the articles of impeachment against Bill Clinton. And I said, "You know what, every one of those could apply to Donald Trump." They lie consistently. I don't go for the word "untruths," by the way. These are lies, in my opinion. And what they are doing to literally tear apart the republic. We're in a constitutional crisis. And no leader should be allowed to do what they have done and get away with it.
After the MSNBC host asked why their guest believed Speaker Ryan and other Republicans were not "standing up more" to President Trump, Weber took aim at Ryan's Christianity:
I honestly can't figure that out. Paul Ryan professes to be a Christian, yet supports the legislation that they do. I mean, I don't understand it at all. There seems to have been a movement over the last few years of really moving towards party over country, in the Republicans -- in the Republican party.
Reid then ended the segment by promising to follow their Democratic guest's campaign and see if they "can flip that House district" as the MSNBC host concluded the show:
JOY REID: Yeah, well, we will see how you do, Linda Weber. Good luck. When is the primary? LINDA WEBER: Thank you very much. The primary's next June. REID: Okay, next June. So we will be paying attention to that race, and we will see if you can flip that House district.
Below is a transcript of relevant portions of the Sunday, May 14, AM Joy on MSNBC:
Story highlights Sri Lanka is hosting the biannual Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM)
The prime ministers of Canada, India and Mauritius have said they will not attend
It follows criticism of Sri Lanka's human rights record after its 26-year war with Tamil rebels
Sri Lanka's high commissioner to the UK blames the criticism on a "proxy propaganda war"
Sri Lanka's high commissioner to Britain has blamed criticism of their country's human rights record on a "proxy propaganda war" being carried out by those who funded the nation's "terrorist conflict."
The prime ministers of Canada, Mauritius and India have withdrawn from the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, or CHOGM, beginning in Colombo on Friday, amid concerns about the rights situation in Sri Lanka after its 26-year civil war with separatist Tamil rebels.
Speaking to CNN's Fred Pleitgen for the "Amanpour" show on the eve of the summit, Chris Nonis said they were unsurprised by the criticism.
"One has to understand that there's a tremendous influence from those who funded the terrorist conflict who are now carrying out, really, a proxy propaganda war.
"What we realize is that over the years -- as people realize the wonderful reconciliation, rehabilitation and reconstruction program that we are carrying out in Sri Lanka -- that gradually that proxy propaganda war will lose its currency and, in that context, I think it's entirely right and fitting that we should host the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting," they said.
"There's a huge dichotomy of disjuncture between what is said abroad in terms of criticism and lack of rights and the freedom and the justice and equality that people are experiencing here."
The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 53 nations that initially formed out of what had been the British Empire. Its charter focuses on developing "free and democratic societies and the promotion of peace and prosperity to improve the lives of all peoples of the Commonwealth."

Heads of member governments meet every two years.
International investigation
Asked about calls for an independent, international investigation into alleged war crimes -- a call repeated by British Foreign Secretary William Hague when they met their Sri Lankan counterpart on the sidelines of the meeting this week -- Nonis responded:
"We don't need an international investigation when we have had a vibrant civilization for 2,500 years. We have perfectly educated people and I think we're perfectly capable of carrying out our own domestic inquiry."
Nonis said the leaders not attending the conference represent three of the five countries that are home to Sri Lanka's largest, wealthiest and strongest diaspora communities.
"Each country, each leader has their domestic political considerations. We understand that. After all, they're politicians," they said.
They described UK opposition leader Ed Miliband's call for Sri Lanka to be stripped of its chairpersonship of the Commonwealth as "extremely silly" and uninformed, saying their country had made "enormous progress" since its war ended in May 2009.
"We cherish the principles of democracy and development -- the twin pillars of the Commonwealth," Nonis said. "We are a very decent, very human group of people. We've had a terrible conflict with the terrorists -- finally the people of Sri Lanka are free."
Civilian deaths
As many as 70,000 people were killed in Sri Lanka's war and in its final stage, which lasted from September 2008 to May 2009, the Sri Lankan army advanced into an area of the north where about 330,000 people were trapped by fighting. A U.N. report in 2011 said the government used "large-scale and widespread shelling" that left a large number of civilians dead.
The number of civilian deaths and injuries are unknown to this day, and U.N. figures greatly differ from those in reports from Sri Lanka's government and various nongovernmental organizations.
Sri Lankan President Mahinda Mahinda Rajapaksa told media Thursday they would "not hesitate to take action against any human rights violations, adding that they have nothing to hide and is very open," according to a Sri Lankan government website.
"He said that Sri Lanka has a strong legal system, a Human Rights Commission, and now the Commonwealth is ready to strengthen it," it said.
On October 7, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that they would not go to this week's meeting and that Deepak Obhrai -- the parliamentary secretary to the minister of foreign affairs and for international human rights -- would attend in their place.
Canada is "deeply concerned" about the situation in Sri Lanka and believes that the government has failed to uphold the Commonwealth's core values, they said.
"The absence of accountability for the serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian standards during and after the civil war is unacceptable," Harper said.
"Canada noted with concern the impeachment of the Sri Lankan chief justice earlier this year and we remain disturbed by ongoing reports of intimidation and incarceration of political leaders and journalists, harassment of minorities, reported disappearances, and allegations of extra judicial killings."
On November 12, the Prime Minister of Mauritius, Navinchandra Ramgoolam, told lawmakers that they would not be attending the summit, sending their minister of foreign affairs instead.
A government statement said Ramgoolam told the country's parliament that they had been monitoring human rights in Sri Lanka and was gravely concerned about violations there.
"Mauritius has never been and will never be indifferent to the human rights violation anywhere in the world, including Sri Lanka," they said.
India's foreign minister
The prime minister of India, which has a large Tamil population, had faced domestic pressure to also withdraw from the conference.
On November 10, India's Ministry of External Affairs said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had written to President Rajapaksa, saying that they too would not attend.
External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid was chosen to represent India instead.
Khurshid told CNN's Pleitgen on "Amanpour" Thursday that a number of factors may have influenced the decision to stay away, including coming elections and economic issues.
"And of course there were competing sentiments in the country about some outstanding issues with Sri Lanka, particularly on the rehabilitation and reconstruction that's imperative after the end of the war," they said.
"We have urged the government of Sri Lanka to take steps forward towards real and meaningful devolution and accountability."
They said India continues to urge speedier action but said: "We can't see an alternative to engagement, particularly if it's a matter that concerns a friendly country in the neighborhood of India."
The Sri Lankan website says that Rajapaksa "expressed satisfaction over Indian External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid attending the CHOGM summit. When an Indian reporter stated that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has skipped the conference in acceding to demands made by Tamil Nadu, the President said that they have not informed this to them and pointed out that the Indian Prime Minister did not even attend the previous summit in Perth two years ago."
'Must be accountability'
British Prime Minister David Cameron, who is attending the summit, issued a statement Thursday saying they see it as "an opportunity to raise our concerns clearly and directly, and to focus the eyes of the world on Sri Lanka."
"Together we must say clearly to the government of Sri Lanka -- our hosts -- that there must be accountability for the past and respect for human rights today," they said.
"Four years on from the end of the civil war and defeat of the 'Tamil Tigers,' a brutal terrorist organization, there has been nowhere near enough improvement. We need to see more progress: genuine freedom of expression and the media, an end to the intimidation of journalists and human rights defenders, action to stamp out torture, demilitarization of the north and reconciliation between communities.
"And of course we need to see a thorough investigation into alleged war crimes."

Dozens of Chinese lawyers have been detained or interrogated over recent days in what seems to be a co-ordinated roundup.
The crackdown has targeted those who take on cases involving free speech, human rights and abuses of power, presenting many of them as motivated by greed and a reckless disregard for social order.
A statement from the Ministry of Public Security said suspects included lawyers, social media celebrities and petitioners but that lawyers were the core.
It accused a group led by the Beijing-based Fengrui Law Firm, of illegally hiring protesters and swaying court decisions in the name of "defending justice and public interests."
It went on to accuse the group of organising more than 40 controversial incidents and severely disrupting public order. It gave an example in which it had allegedly presented a legitimate police shooting at a railway station as a murder conspiracy.
'Serious crimes'
Since last Thursday at least six lawyers have been detained and more than 50 taken in for questioning by police in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, according to Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.

It is not clear how many are still in custody. Some of those questioned had signed a letter asking authorities to release Wang Yu, a human rights lawyer who vanished from their home last week and is now believed to be in detention.
Ms Wang worked for the Fengrui law firm. Another Fengrui lawyer, Zhou Shifeng, disappeared the day after one of their clients was released last week. State media have confirmed that six people including Wang Yu and Zhou Shifeng are in criminal detention for "seriously violating the law". The People's Daily said Mr Zhou was suspected of serious crimes.
It also attacked another employee of the firm, online activist Wu Gan, saying they had exploited their fame and exaggerated sensitive incidents for profit. Mr Wu has been in detention since May and earlier this month was charged with "inciting subversion". The People's Daily denounced what it called a "major criminal organisation" which "seriously disturbed social order".
'A mockery'
Last year saw reforms designed to make courts less corrupt and less embedded in local politics. There were promises to exclude tainted evidence, torture and coercion. But at the same time, President Xi said the rule of law would be "a knife whose handle was in the hands of the party and the people".
Any campaign to promote the rule of law which thinks lawyers are part of the problem rather the solution is in trouble. But this is the direction of travel in China. Groups that cannot be co-opted become pariahs. And lawyers who assert a set of values outside the narrowing space allotted to them by the state are no exception.
There would be no constitutionalism, judicial independence or separation of powers. And clearly no lawyers or law firms who put their client's interests ahead of those of the party.
"Such an unprecedented nationwide crackdown can only have been sanctioned from within the central government," said William Née, China Researcher at Amnesty International. "This coordinated attack on lawyers makes a mockery of President Xi Jinping's claims to promote the rule of law."
'Growing alarm'
Xi Jinping came to power nearly three years ago vowing to tackle corruption and promote judicial fairness. But now lawyers are in police sights, with the state news agency Xinhua saying "the detainees are suspected of illegally organizing paid protests, hyping public sentiment and fabricating rumours on the Internet to sway court decisions".
The US State Department condemned the detentions saying: "Over the last few days we have noted with growing alarm reports that Chinese public security forces have systematically detained individuals who share the common attribute of peacefully defending the rights of others, including those who lawfully challenge official policies."
It's not just lawyers. In the name of security, and the need to protect against hostile foreign forces, the overall climate for civil society is worsening, with churches, women's rights groups and labour activists all under attack. The internet faces ever closer supervision and communist party cells are being established in high profile private companies.
Any discussion of universal or alternative values has become taboo, a measure of the Party's sense of its own fragility. For a party which fears its own overthrow, any group, any idea, any individual, could become, in the words of Chairman Mao, "the spark that lights the prairie fire".
To protect the party against such sparks, and inoculate the public against contending narratives, President Xi has the "Chinese dream", a catchall slogan to embrace a mix of national pride, pursuit of wealth and adherence to a special form of modernity in which love of country can equal love of the Communist Party.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Xi Jinping has introduced a slogan to embrace national pride and the pursuit of wealth
It's the logic of the Chinese Dream that drove many aspects of last week's stock market intervention and which put graduating students at China's top university under orders to chant the slogan "Revive A share, benefit the people!"
No great surprise then that China's parliament should have just passed a new security law which conflates the Communist Party's monopoly on power with national security.
But a recent Freedom House report claims that despite heightened repression, fear is diminishing. "Activities that the authorities have invested tremendous resources in suppressing have continued and even expanded."
I find that hard to judge. I also find it hard to predict the effect of the detentions and interrogations we've witnessed in recent days.
But there can be no doubt that the irony of all of this is not lost on the defence lawyers who are now sitting in cells hoping for a visit from their own defence lawyer.
For many years they tried to advance a "rule of law" agenda within the system and could have been forgiven for hoping that when President Xi declared their own determination to pursue the rule of law their cause might prosper.
Where do China's lawyers go from here? And who will be the defence lawyer when so many of them are behind bars?
The “Bloomin' Onion” is arguably the best appetizer at Outback Steakhouse, but as you could probably guess, it's far from vegan-friendly – both the batter and the dipping sauce contain dairy and eggs – so we decided to veganize it!
While doing research for this recipe, we found a lot of conflicting information. There seemed to be some confusion over the exact method of preparation and the ingredients of the sauce. Jokingly, we called up Outback Steakhouse and asked them how they make it. We figured they'd probably tell us to get lost, but much to our surprise, they actually told us exactly how they prepare it, including how they make the sauce!
My Latest Videos
Apart from veganizing the ingredients, we also modified the preparation a bit to make this an “at home” version. We assume, that like us, most people don't have a deep fryer with a basket, which is what you need if you want to make it exactly like the Bloomin' Onion you'd get at Outback. However, you can still get pretty good results frying it in a pot of oil on the stovetop. The only difference, really, is that you'll lose some of the pedals and batter from over-handling it – getting it in and out of the pot without a basket is a precarious process, to say the least.
You can simplify the process even further by using an onion blossom cutter. It's a simple contraption that cuts the onion perfectly for you. The cheap ones cost about $5 to $10, and have mixed reviews, but the industrial ones used in restaurants cost up to $400! Of course, the professional grade cutters are made to do what they do all day, every day for years and years. We decided a simple kitchen knife would be just fine for us.
We also learned that bigger is not better. We bought a massive onion from the farmers market, and we thought it was going to be perfect for a Bloomin Onion because of its size, but we now know we would have gotten better results from a much smaller onion – at least half the size or smaller. You can see the onion we used in the photos below. It was 2 lb!
Video game voice actors known for their roles in iconic game series like Resident Evil, Metal Gear Solid, and more are considering a strike for higher compensation for their work.
They've begun to drum up awareness for the movement via the hashtag #PerformanceMatters, with a wide variety of voice actors and fans rallying behind the cause.
“Dear actors & gamers, Please retweet if you agree that #PerformanceMatters in video games #IAmOnBoard2015,” said David Hayter on Twitter. Jennifer Hale also sounded off on Twitter: “voted YES bc #performancematters #Iamonboard2015.”
The union representing voice actors, SAG-AFTRA, is looking into a strike, if their demands aren't reached. According to their official website, SAG-AFTRA is hoping to obtain performance bonuses like royalties after a game begins making profit; a stunt coordinator on set (as well as stunt pay for “vocally stressful recording sessions”); more communication on game projects; more preparation for motion capture; and more.
SAG-AFTRA has entered negotiations with large publishers like Activision and EA since February, to no avail. Union members can vote on whether or not they want to go on strike since the 16th of September, with voting closing on October 5th.
How are game developers reacting to this? While you won't see much publicly on social media, we've obtained some reactions from both AAA and former-AAA developers. To protect the identities of these individuals, we've censored their names.
“Drop them all,” said one developer. “I couldn't give less of a shit who the actors are that perform game voices. These people are nuts. They already get too much money for what is arguably a pretty easy gig. We're working years on single projects for, if we are lucky, fair salaries.”
“The problem us devs have is that they are asking for royalties for a day or a week of work when devs work on titles for 2-5 years and get none,” said another developer. “Every few years they do this and re-learn that they aren't that special,” said another developer.
“And the ONE guy that gets all the jobs so ‘narrative designers' can jerk off to meeting him,” said another developer.
One developer responded to a fan saying they want higher rewards for voice talent, while also questioning whether or not underpaid developers could strike as well. “Devs can't strike. There's a much higher supply of potential devs than jobs. A dev strike would be met with a wave of goodbye. There's nothing so special about certain voice actors that I can't live without.”
Finally, another developer recanted a bygone time in which game developers got back more from the games they helped create. “There was a time when devs used to get royalties… and you worked your ass off in the hope that when the game made it big you would see a nice pay day. Now, seems that game development is like a labor camp where no matter how hard you work you will never get a big reward for your efforts.”
It's worth reiterating these are only a handful of game developers, and are by no means an example of the gaming industry at large. However, it really makes you wonder how other game developers feel. If you're a game developer and would like to speak up regarding the issue – please contact us!
What are your thoughts on the entire thing? Do voice actors deserve higher compensation for their work, or should we be looking instead to benefit the game developers first?
The US's incoming administration has an historic opportunity to extend America's global leadership by promoting the economic transformations underway in Africa. An effective US strategy would be based on the fact that Africa's development still greatly depends on the performance of its agri-food systems.
Farming remains the primary source of employment for 65% of Africa's population. Poverty rates are in decline. But they remain unacceptably high. Putting more money in the hands of 500 million Africans who rely on farming for their livelihoods will have a decisive influence on the pace of economic growth.
Virtually no country in the world has transformed its economy from an agrarian economy to a modern one without sustained agricultural productivity growth.
Why should US citizens care? Quite simply, because investing in Africa's economic growth is in America's national interest.
US exports of agricultural products to sub-Saharan Africa totalled $2.6 billion in 2013. This will grow rapidly if Africa continues to develop. By 2050, sub-Saharan Africa will have 2.1 billion people – 22% of the world's population compared to 12% today. Rapidly rising populations and incomes will increase the demand for a safe, affordable and sustainable global food supply.
US farmers and agribusiness can help themselves by helping Africa meet its rapidly growing food needs. This can be done through investments in agri-food systems as well as supporting a sustainable, efficient global food system.
It is increasingly recognised that most African agricultural exports do not compete with US farm and agribusiness interests. In most instances they are highly complementary.
Rising farm incomes in Africa promote growth multipliers. These expand private investment and employment opportunities in African agri-food systems and in the rest of the economy. Rising incomes in Africa also promote US export interests. A vibrant agricultural sector will hasten Africa's transition to a more prosperous, diversified and stable region.
These are the benefits that would emerge from strong partnerships between African governments, the private sector and millions of African farmers and entrepreneurs. Enlightened US development assistance programmes are required.
A changing landscape
An effective US government approach will need to recognise the dramatic changes in the African landscape over the past few decades with respect to partnerships. Development models premised on 1980s conditions no longer fit 2017 realities. US development organisations can be especially effective if they understand that today there is much greater local expertise and awareness.
Many more Africans have professional job expertise related to agri-food systems than they did 25 years ago. This is true in both the public and private sectors. Many are educated internationally and possess valuable technical skills. They can operate effectively given superior knowledge of local culture and connections with centres of local power. That means they're capable of influencing government investments.
An effective US strategy toward African agricultural development will engage more African professionals than in the past.
But conditions have not changed much in at least one important respect. Public agricultural institutions, such as R&D and extension services, play a crucial role in supporting farm productivity growth. But many in Africa can't fulfil their mandates. Most African agricultural research systems are woefully underfunded. Asian farmers benefit from the fact that their governments annually spend over eight times more on agriculture on average than African governments. Not surprisingly, the pace of productivity growth in Asia has eclipsed Africa's.
A new model for development assistance
US and African governments share core interests in promoting private investment in African food systems. This would be done in partnership with local firms. It would support fair agricultural trade and a sustainable global food system.
Achieving mutual US-Africa interests for economic transformation in Africa will require greater support for African institutions that support the development of agri-food systems. This means supporting institutions that create the next generation of African educators, farm extension workers, research scientists, entrepreneurs and policymakers. These people will define the pace of private investment and agricultural transformation in African countries.
The US has one of the world's most dynamic and productive agricultural systems. This is greatly indebted to the US land-grant university system, the US Cooperative Extension Service, and a host of other public institutions. These bring vital practical information to agricultural producers, small business owners, consumers, families and young people. This rich history and know-how means the US can provide much needed leadership and expertise to support institutional capacity building in Africa.
My colleagues, Isaac Minde and Chance Kabaghe, and I propose that the main thrust of a new approach to development assistance in Africa should be to shift the role of US organisations. Instead of providing the technologies, services and answers themselves they should help African organisations to do so.
The time has arrived for the US to find effective ways to support capacity building. This should include African universities, agricultural training colleges, vocational schools, crop research organisations, extension systems and policy analysis institutes. International private companies, universities and NGOs have important but increasingly redefined roles that put African institutions in the lead.
Once enacted, the proposals made here will take time to generate their full impact. This is why there is no time to waste in getting started.

MADRID — Spain's repeat election Sunday failed to clarify the political future of the European Union's fifth-largest economy, as another inconclusive ballot compelled political leaders to resume six months of negotiations on who should form a government. The conservative Popular Party, which has ruled for the past four years, again collected the most votes in the election but still fell shy of the majority of 176 seats it needs in the 350-seat Parliament to form a government on its own.

With 99.9 per cent of the votes counted late Sunday, incumbent Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's party had picked up 137 seats in Parliament. That is better than the 123 it won in December but still means it will need allies if it wants to govern. Its earlier efforts to find support from rival parties after December proved fruitless. Even so, Rajoy declared they would make a push for power, telling a victory rally in Madrid, "We won the election, we demand the right to govern." It is unlikely to be as simple as that, however. For the past six months, the main parties have quarrelled endlessly over who should assume power. In the end, King Felipe VI had to call another election. A third one, in six months' time, is still a possibility.

Antonio Barroso, a London-based analyst with the Teneo Intelligence political risk consulting group, said they expected tough negotiations between the parties in coming weeks. "It was hoped that these elections would bring clarity and that a government would be formed quickly, but I don't think that's how it's going to be," Barroso said. Spain has never had a coalition government. The centre-left Socialist Party placed second, collecting 85 seats, according to the count by the country's Interior Ministry. That was five fewer seats than six months ago but the Socialists kept their influence by fending off a challenge from a radical leftist alliance. "We are the foremost political power on the left," Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez told supporters in Madrid in their own bid to ensure political influence.
Unidos Podemos (United We Can) — which brings together Podemos, a two-year-old party that grew out of a grassroots anti-austerity protest movement, and the communists and the Greens — was third with 71 seats. The alliance, headed by ponytailed political science professor Pablo Iglesias, had hoped to overtake the Socialists and break the country's traditional two-party system. The Popular Party and the Socialists have alternated in power for decades.

"We had expected to do better," Iglesias said. The business-friendly Ciudadanos party came in fourth with 32 seats. Other, smaller parties won the rest of the vote by Spain's roughly 36.5 million voters. Public anger at high unemployment, cuts in government spending on cherished services such as welfare and education and unrelenting political corruption scandals shaped the two-week election campaign. At a Madrid polling station, many voters said they wanted Sunday's election to bring a break with the past. "I'm voting for change, so that our politicians understand that we don't agree with what they've been doing," said Maria Jesus Genovar, a 47-year-old teacher who supported Unidos Podemos. Unidos Podemos wants to improve job security, increase the minimum wage and strengthen the welfare state and other public services. But Maria Jose Escos, a 59-year-old government worker, said they had no appetite for the new parties. "I'd like everything to be like it was before," the Socialists supporter said. Iglesias, who leads Unidos Podemos, has said they want a pact with the Socialists in order to oust Rajoy. But a major sticking point is Iglesias's insistence on letting the powerful northeastern region of Catalonia stage an independence referendum — a possibility other main parties have rejected outright. Ciudadanos is willing to talk to both the Popular Party and the Socialists but wants no deal with Unidos Podemos. Besides tensions over Catalonia, Spanish politics has been dominated by a national unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent and an unrelenting stream of corruption scandals, mostly involving members of the Popular Party and the Socialists.

The government will immediately dismantle all illegal settlement outposts built on privately-owned Palestinian land, with the sole exception of the house owned by slain Israel Defense Forces officer Eliraz Peretz, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided on Monday in consultation with the defense minister and the attorney general.
The decision, which will be submitted to the High Court of Justice in response to 15 petitions demanding the outposts' demolition, will apply to at least three outposts inhabited by about 100 families.

At the same time, however, the government will begin legalizing illegal outposts built on state land. Regarding Peretz's house, the government will ask the court for more time to find a solution.
The decision was approved unanimously by the "septet" forum of top cabinet ministers.
Later on Monday, Netanyahu told a meeting of their Likud faction that Israel could not ignore growing international pressure over construction in the West Bank, but that the government would preserve ongoing settlement activity to the best of its ability.
"We are currently making efforts to maintain existing construction, but we must understand that we are [faced with] a very difficult international reality," they told the meeting.
They were speaking one week after the United States vetoed a United Nations resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank and four days before officials from the Quartet of Middle East peacemakers were to meet Israeli and Palestinian representatives in an effort to jump-start the peace process.

"The American veto in the Security Council took great effort to achieve," Netanyahu said. "We could ignore it all and say 'no problem,' but as the prime minister responsible for this state, I have the ultimate responsibility."
As such, they hinted that Israel should refrain from pushing new construction plans.
"I am the prime minister, and I am responsible for this state," said Netanyahu. "We could surely hide our heads in the sand, but that's not how I do things."
Nevertheless, Netanyahu said, the government would strive to ensure that current construction could continue, as long as it is legal. "There is construction in the West Bank," they said. "It's true that in some places there are no tenders and that is being checked, but we are currently making efforts to maintain existing construction."
The septet is to meet again on Tuesday to decide whether to send Netanyahu's envoy for the peace process, Isaac Molho, to the Quartet conference.
Netanyahu has voiced reservations about doing so, fearing that by agreeing to send Molho, they would open the door to international pressure regarding the terms of new peace talks. Specifically, the premier is afraid of being forced to agree to discuss a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders.
Officials in the Prime Minister's Office indicated that Netanyahu had been in contact with the U.S. administration in an attempt to discover the goals of the Brussels session before making their decision.
As you can see in this helpful chart from the Kaiser Family Foundation, America pays much more for health care than any other first-world country.
There are a lot of false ideas or very minor explanations that are overstated to try to justify why we pay so much.
Other countries are just evil nations that allow thousands to die in the street for lack of care. False
Our costs are hidden by things like the tax exemptions so we need more consumer-driven smart shopping like an excise tax to eliminate low-deductible insurance and insurance exchanges. False– basically every cheaper country has lower co-pays, deductibles, out-of-pocket costs and are, in general, less consumer driven.
basically every cheaper country has lower co-pays, deductibles, out-of-pocket costs and are, in general, less consumer driven. American's health care costs are high because we are fat. Only a minor part of the answer –the UK has much lower costS despite very high obesity rates.
–the UK has much lower costS despite very high obesity rates. America's use of fee-for-service result in too much care. Only a minor part of the answer–many cheaper countries use fee-for-service (Japan, Germany, France) and our average hospitals stays tend to be short.
The main reason for our abnormally high health care costs is that our politicians let the hospitals, drugmakers, device makers and diagnostic labs rip us off.
To understand the real problem, I recommend quickly looking through the slides in this document (PDF), produced by the International Federation of Health Plans, comparing the cost of health care services in America to the rest of the world. I have reproduced just two below to give you an idea.
Looking through the charts, you will see the amount more that we pay for almost every individual health care service is very similar to the amount more we spend as a country on health care, overall, compared to the rest of the world.
I think the most damning are the brandname drug price charts. These are the same pills made by the same companies for every country, but we pay significantly more.
What is the solution every other country has hit upon to lower their costs? Central price regulation.
Most medicine doesn't really work like a free market because it is either more like a monopoly or hostage situation–you can't put a price on your urgent need to be saved from death. Even when it could work like a market, the huge imbalance of knowledge makes smart consumerism basically impossible. So, all sensible countries do the same thing when dealing essential and unavoidable monopolies, they regulate prices, as we do with utilities.
In single-payer countries, this is obviously done as an inherent part of having only the one government insurer. In other countries like Japan, Germany, or Switzerland, they use all-payer. This is were the federal or local government works with the providers and insurers to establish a fair, uniform pricing system.
Not only do collective negotiations result in lower prices, but it doesn't have the massive amount of administrative waste you see in our system. When you have thousands of insurers independently negotiating with thousands of providers, the system needs to spend huge amounts on paperwork, billing, coding, and processing claims, to name just a few.
There is no secret about the solution, so why don't we have it?
So, with basic data around the world looking as it does, why were Democrats talking about bending cost curve, IT, accountable care organizations, more individual health care cost consciousness, and smarter insurance markets, but not all-payer or single-payer? The answer is good old fashion corruption.
The drugmakers don't really want reforms that would allow regular Americans and the government to pay 30 percent less for their products. So, big health care industry players take just a small amount of the billions in profits they make overcharging us and use it to spend hundreds of millions on lobbying Congress, ensuring our politicians will ignore the solution and choose to let the ripping off of American consumers continue.

A short time from now, on a CES show floor far, far away...
(Cue the fanfare.)
THE HAIER R2-D2 MOVING REFRIGERATOR
It is a period of calm before the madness of January's Consumer Electronics Showcase in Las Vegas. Haier Asia, striking from a public relations office in Miami, Florida, has won its first appliance-related headline of the season.
During the opening week of "Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens," it releases secret plans to the ultimate weapon -- THE R2-D2 MOVING REFRIGERATOR, a remote-controlled mini-fridge with enough cooling power to chill beverages for an entire binge-watch of the original trilogy.
Pursued by journalists eager to cover any and all things Star Wars, the full-size replica droid with authentic lighting, projection, and sound effects races towards Nevada at its top speed of 1 kilometer per hour, custodian of the geek appeal that can win its maker a fair share of fanboy love, and restore the refrigeration category's place in the blogosphere spotlight...
Oh, and it sells for just under a million yen in Japan. Haier Asia showed off a prototype of the droid back in June, though the built-in projector seems to be a new addition to its capabilities (but who knows if the 720p HD projector will be good enough to help a Princess save the universe).
International orders aren't being accepted at this time, but if you're curious, that price comes out to about $8,000 (or roughly £5,500/AU$11,500). We'll try and track it down next month in Las Vegas.
33 radio recordings of RKO's The Shadow, recorded as main character by Orson Welles between 1937 and 1938
It doesn't happen that often that a cultural icon plays a \"genre\" role, and in the 1930's it probably happened even less. But before a certain well-documented Martian Invasion rocketed them to fame and a contract with RKO, a 22 year-old Orson Welles funded their theatrical productions with radio work, including a year on the Mutual Network's now-legendary \"superhero\" radio program The Shadow.
The program, loosely adapted from the popular pulp magazine series, told the story of Lamont Cranston, a wealthy young man-about-town who used their hypnotic powers to cloud men's minds so that they could not see him, fighting crime as an Invisible Avenger known only as The Shadow.
Welles played the dual role in 1937 and 1938, first for 26 episodes for the show's long-running sponsor Blue Coal, then for a summer series sponsored by Goodrich Safety Silver-Town Tires. For many years it was believed that the syndicated \"Goodrich\" series had run for 15 episodes... until a complete collection of recordings surfaced in the estate of a former Goodrich executive and it was realized that the summer season had been a full 26 episodes - and that 11 full episodes starring Welles had been discovered that had not been heard since they originally aired 70 years ago.

Subject: Good for people new to otr. Ive listened to many many episodes of the shadow. I liked it very much at first but then after a while I noticed most of the episodes were very generic to each other. Heres things that were similar in each episode. The shadow rarely saved innocent people from death. They do though at the very last minute save one person, at the end of each episode. Anyways, margo must be psycho. Cranston and their always joke in the end of an episode after a one or two deaths happened. Of course, each episode starts with them back to normal, and orson welles would want them to both be jolly so the listeners dont get bored. Another similarity that mostly always happens if margo asks them "but how do you get in" (referring to get into a building of some sort) and Cranston answered something like "As the shadow". It happens in lots of episodes which makes margo quite a stupid character. Another poorly written review by me (just wanted to explain my problems with the show) I give this show 4 stars because it had interesting characters. The plot twists were easily guessable but nevertheless its good. This is a must for otr listeners even if it has its cons. - November 19, 2013Good for people new to otr.

Subject: Bret Morrison was the definite Shadow I'll have to agree with Shadows Girl that Bret Morrison was by far the best Shadow on radio. They had that right quality for the Lamont Cranston man about town air and yet when they did the Shadow, their delivery was menancing but not theatrical or campy. If you listen to Orson Welles on their Black Mueum program, their pausing between words or lines for effect is a bit stagy.The Shadow was meant to be melodramtic and not at all classic stage drama. Grace Mathews and Gertrude Werner probably had to keep from laughing when they delivered their "plkeae spare me spelech" to the maniacal villian just before the Shadow interved. My favorite lines were the closing "The Weed of Crime Bear Bitter Fruit."

Image caption John Sopko thinks they are now getting their message across
As a young lawyer in the 1980s, John Sopko made a name for themselves fighting the mafia in Cleveland, Ohio.
Now they are taking a similarly fearless approach to uncovering fraud and mismanagement in the US aid effort in Afghanistan.
Since taking office as the United States Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar) last year, 61-year-old Mr Sopko has been making headlines with their unusually outspoken criticism of how US taxpayers' money is being spent.
In July alone, their office fired off eight separate reports highlighting concerns in a range of areas, from shoddy school construction and fraud by local contractors, to the failings of a new justice training programme.
"You've got to kick the tyres," they say in a typically forthright quote in their latest report. "You've got to verify that the money you gave to buy fuel bought the fuel."
Anti-corruption hotline
In their offices on the outskirts of Washington, Mr Sopko has a big map of Afghanistan to help them keep track of where their inspectors are working.
Poor contracting led to the deaths of a number of individuals John Sopko, Special Inspector General Afghanistan Reconstruction
Their staff of 180 people includes 50 on the ground in Afghanistan. So far they have carried out checks in 23 of the country's 34 provinces.
Their official website hosts a hotline for reporting fraud online. Afghans can also call a local number to register complaints in the main languages of Afghanistan.
And they do: the system has led to a number of investigations, arrests and prosecutions.
In September, a US state department employee pleaded guilty to receiving an illegal gratuity of $30,000 (£18,000) from a public official in Afghanistan. They were charged after Sigar received a tip-off on its hotline.
Mr Sopko is blunt about the scale of the waste their team has uncovered.
A recent case on their books involves a $34m military command centre, which they say the US army went ahead and built in Helmand even though they knew it would not be needed after the 2014 international troop withdrawal.
"Once you start a plan… it's very difficult to stop," they tell the BBC. "What we're going to do is to find out why they continued, even though the commanding general there specially told them a year before… don't build it, I won't use it, I won't need it."
Image caption Money that should have been spent stopping roadside bombs went astray
Another even more troubling case under investigation by Mr Sopko's team is the apparent theft of $1m from contracts to install protection systems against roadside bombs, the explosive devices favoured by the Taliban.
Afghan sub-contractors billed the US for blocking at least 250 drainage holes under highways where roadside bombs tend to be placed,
But the job was either improperly done or not completed at all.
"It's not just money being stolen from contract," Mr Sopko says. "Fraud kills. In this case, poor contracting led to the deaths of a number of individuals."
The US Defence Department told the BBC that it takes Mr Sopko's investigations very seriously, saying "the matter regarding the facility in Helmand Province remains under investigation".
The statement also pointed out that it was US military personnel themselves who first noticed problems with contractors installing roadside bomb defence systems and alerted the inspectors.
Few success stories
Mr Sopko's work has leaded them to some sobering conclusions about the impact of reconstruction work in Afghanistan so far.
"We are so concerned about the lack of successes that I actually sent a letter to the secretary of state, to the secretary of defence and the head of [US international aid agency] USAid a number of months ago and said, give me your 10 most successful programmes. So we can learn from them," they told the BBC.
"They haven't been able to answer that question. So we're still looking for some successes."
It's clear that Mr Sopko's relentless barrage of criticism is not always what the US military top brass want to hear.
As they themselves admit in their latest quarterly audit, 43 of the recommendations they made to the military for new measures to prevent insurgent groups getting access to US government grants were rejected outright.
"I am deeply troubled that the US military can pursue, attack and even kill terrorists and their supporters," they write in the report, "but that some in the US government believe we cannot prevent these same people from receiving a government contract."
Image caption Road haulage is big business in Afghanistan
But the thick skin and determination that helped Mr Sopko pursue the feared crime boss James Licavoli back in Cleveland seem to be standing them in good stead.
By no means all of their recommendations go unheeded.
In August their office said they had managed to freeze the bank accounts of an Afghan trucking contractor accused of defrauding the US out of more than $77m.
Investigations into the case are continuing.
"I think we're getting the message across and some of the policy-makers are taking our advice very seriously," they say.
"We are slowly turning that ship of reconstruction around so that it will be done better, faster and more safely not only for our taxpayers but for our troops and civilians working in Afghanistan."

Congressman Ron Paul has called for Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to be fired for their involvement in the AIG bailout scandal, adding that the fiasco proves the Fed should be stripped of its powers and audited.
Explosive emails released last week could see Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner become embroiled in criminal charges for their role in a cover up that exposes the monumental criminality behind the $182.3 billion bailout of American International Group Inc.
In November and December 2008, The Federal Reserve Bank of New York instructed the bailed out AIG to hide from the public details regarding payments the insurance giant made to banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Société Générale SA.
[efoods]Using Fed secured taxpayer bailout money, AIG paid several banks 100 percent of the face value of credit-default swaps, as other financial institutions were negotiating deep discounts for the unregulated paper assets that do not have to be backed by cash.
Via their Texas Straight Talk phone update, Congressman Paul said today that Geithner had helped hide from taxpayers the fact that banks were compensated for “making some horrifically bad decisions”.
“These banks should have suffered the consequences of the huge risks they were taking,” said the Congressman. “After all, they kept plenty of rewards when times were good. Instead, the Fed found a way to socialize these major losses so these banks could survive and continue making more bad decisions, at the expense of the American people and the value of the dollar.”
Paul pointed out that claims the bailout helped save the economy are directly contradicted by the latest job figures, which show 85,000 job losses in December and the unemployment rate, which according to traditional calculations stands at a whopping 22 per cent.
“It is hard to argue that this sort of government waste has done anything but harm to our economy,” said Paul. Raiding Main Street to bail out Wall Street is a foolish idea. Main Street productivity and the strength of the dollar is the bedrock of the economy. You cannot gut this foundation without eventually toppling everything else. This is what too many policymakers either don't understand or refuse to face. Or even worse, perhaps they do understand, but don't care!”
The Congressman added that the whole fiasco only underlined the preposterousness of the claim that the Federal Reserve should retain its independence.
“This claim that the Fed should have “independence” is a canard,” said Paul. “They very much enjoy their comfortable pattern of bailing out friends and devaluing the currency with no oversight and no accountability. Geithner specifically asked officials at AIG not to disclose to the SEC or to the public particulars about this special deal for their friends. We only know these details now because AIG was eventually forthcoming when Congress demanded some answers.”
Paul said that Geithner has been “praised and thanked” for their actions but instead should be “rebuked and fired,” while the scandal proves that the Fed should be stripped of its power to engage in “experimental” monetary policy in the future.
Watch a clip of the Congressman's comments below.
The Supreme Court heard the highly anticipated case of the Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. Tuesday's clash at the high court pitted baker Jack Phillips' First Amendment claims of artistic freedom against the anti-discrimination arguments of the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, and the two men Phillips turned away in 2012.
The commission ruled that Phillips violated the state's anti-discrimination law when they refused to make a wedding cake for Charlie Craig and David Mullins. The argument is the first involving gay rights before the Supreme Court since it ruled in 2015 that states could not prevent same-sex couples from marrying.
The Trump administration is supporting Phillips in their argument that they can't be forced to create a cake that violates their religious beliefs. Phillips told CBS News' Jan Crawford that their cakes are personal artistic expressions -- the cake is the canvas, and they see the icing as their paint. He's making both a religious liberty and a free speech argument before the court. This appears to be the first time the federal government has asked the justices to carve out an exception from an anti-discrimination law.
During the first half of oral argument on Tuesday the justices questioned an attorney for Phillips, who made the First Amendment argument.
But Justice Elena Kagan wanted to know "how do you draw a line?" about what counts as speech. Kagan wanted to know, "Why is there no speech in creating a wonderful hairdo?" and "Where would you put a tailor?"
Justice Sonia Sotomayor told Phillips' attorney: "The primary purpose of food of any kind is to be eaten."
Meanwhile, during a riveting argument at the high court, Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is seen as the linchpin vote in the case, worried that a ruling for baker Jack Phillips might allow stores to post signs that say they "do not bake cakes for gay weddings."
But later in the argument, Kennedy said Colorado's human rights commission seemed "neither tolerant nor respectful of Mr. Phillips' religious beliefs" when it found their refusal to bake a cake for the gay couple violated the state's anti-discrimination law.
The 81-year-old Kennedy is the author of the 2015 gay marriage decision and all the court's major gay-rights rulings. At the same time, Kennedy has forcefully defended free-speech rights in their nearly 30 years as a justice.
Colorado native Neil Gorsuch also will be taking part in the most important gay rights case since they joined the Supreme Court in April.
The case's outcome also could affect photographers and florists who have voiced objections similar to those of Phillips.
"Artists shouldn't be forced to express what the government dictates. The commission ordered Jack to celebrate what their faith prohibits or to stop doing the work they love. The Supreme Court has never compelled artistic expression, and doing so here would lead to less civility, diversity, and freedom for everyone, no matter their views on marriage," Kristen Waggoner of the Alliance Defending Freedom, who is representing Phillips, said in an email.
But the American Civil Liberties Union and other rights groups that have sided with the gay couple said they fear a ruling for Phillips could allow for discrimination by a range of business owners. They said the court has never recognized what they call a constitutional right to discriminate.
"The question is whether a shop like Masterpiece Cakeshop can put up a sign in its window saying, 'Wedding cakes for heterosexual couples only,'" ACLU deputy legal director Louise Melling said. The ACLU is representing Craig and Mullins. The couple told Crawford they see the case as a straight-up issue of discrimination.
Colorado is among only 21 states that have statewide laws barring discrimination against gays and lesbians in public accommodations.
The case, Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, 16-111, will be decided by late June.
While beauty creams on Earth often claim to have "antigravity" effects on the skin, a weightless environment may actually cause premature aging of the epidermis, according to a new study looking at mice.
Three mice that lived on the International Space Station for 91 days — the longest period that rodents have ever spent in space — suffered a 15% thinning in the dermis, the subsurface layer of the skin. This is the first study of the effects of a weightless environment on animal skin, the authors of the new study say.
One previous study on a human astronaut also showed thinning of the skin, as well as changes in elasticity and reduced healing, after six months in orbit. Another astronaut skin study called Skin-B is currently underway on the orbiting laboratory. The findings could have implications for the health of astronauts on long-duration spaceflights.
It's well-known that astronauts in space report having dry skin that is more susceptible to small cuts. That's on top of the other recorded health effects caused by living in microgravity, including bone and muscle loss, changes in vision and stiff arteries. While many of these ailments can be repaired over time once the astronauts return to Earth, they raise concerns about the health effects of long-term space missions.
Space experiments that involve animals give researchers the opportunity to study the health effects of microgravity in ways that often cannot be done with human astronauts (studies on humans are usually noninvasive).
The Mice Drawer System (MDS) Tissue Sharing program provided 20 research teams with organs and tissues from three mice that lived aboard the orbiting station for 91 days. A group of researchers led by Betty Nusgens, an honorary professor of biology at the University of Liège in Belgium, took samples of the mice skin, and found a 15% reduction in the thickness of the dermis. Nusgens said this rate of thinning is faster than what is normally seen in humans on Earth (even when accounting for the shorter life spans of mice).
Nusgens said healthy skin in young mice (and people) experiences some destruction of old collagen, which is then replaced with new collagen. Skin remains healthy and normal as long as the synthesis of new collagen is equal to or higher than the destruction of old collagen. In orbit, the mouse skin showed a rise in both the production and destruction of collagen in the dermis, compared with control mice on Earth, but with a larger increase in collagen degradation.
"The final balance [of collagen] is negative, meaning that the degradation is probably more active than the synthesis," Nusgens told Space.com. "So this is a progressive loss of collagen in the skin, like in aging people."
Nusgens said scientists don't know why the skins of mice undergo accelerated degradation in microgravity.
"We know that the cells that make collagen in the skin — called fibroblasts — these cells are responsive to mechanical stress and to stress relaxation, so [the] cell can respond to the loss of gravity in space," Nusgens said. "Knowing that, we are going to send fibroblasts alone [to] the [International Space Station] next December."
The researchers also found some changes in hair growth in the space mice.
Hair goes through cycles, during which a given strand may be in various phases, including a growth phase or a resting phase. On Earth, Nusgens and their team found roughly 1 out of every 9 hairs on a control mouse's body is in the growth phase; but in the astro mice, all the hairs were in the growth phase.
"Something is disturbed with the hair cycle in these mice," they said. "Hair growth depends on stem cells, so we feel that the program of the stem cell may be disturbed by space. But we have no experimental evidence of this; it's just hypothesis."
Nusgens called the result "completely unexpected," and said there are no experiments they are aware of to test hair growth in astronauts.
Nusgens notes that it's unlikely that an earth-bound study with such a small sample size (only three test mice) would be accepted for publication, but exceptions are made for experiments done in space because data is hard to come by.
"We would like to have more animals, but this will never be repeated with such a long experiment, I think," Nusgens said.
NASA is currently running a skin experiment on astronauts aboard the International Space Station called Skin-B, which will "improve our understanding of skin aging, which is slow on Earth but very much accelerated in space," according to NASA.
The research was published in the new journal npj Microgravity.

Propaganda is dangerous. It is used to manufacture consent. Noam Chomsky has done a great dissection of propaganda in their book Manufacturing Consent. I urge you all to watch this documentary of Manufacturing Consent:
Basically what propaganda does is that it clouds our minds with misinformation or the distortion of the truth, until we accept such information as the truth itself, thus losing our ability at giving government an informed consent to run our lives.
An amendment that would legalize the use of propaganda on American audiences is being inserted into the latest defense authorization bill, BuzzFeed has learned.
The amendment would “strike the current ban on domestic dissemination” of propaganda material produced by the State Department and the Pentagon, according to the summary of the law at the House Rules Committee's official website.
The tweak to the bill would essentially neutralize two previous acts—the Smith-Mundt Act of 1948 and Foreign Relations Authorization Act in 1987—that had been passed to protect U.S. audiences from our own government's misinformation campaigns.
http://www.opednews.com/...
The new law would give sweeping powers to the State Department and Pentagon to push television, radio, newspaper, and social media onto the U.S. public. “It removes the protection for Americans,” says a Pentagon official who is concerned about the law. “It removes oversight from the people who want to put out this information. There are no checks and balances. No one knows if the information is accurate, partially accurate, or entirely false.”
According to this official, “senior public affairs” officers within the Department of Defense want to “get rid” of Smith-Mundt and other restrictions because it prevents information activities designed to prop up unpopular policies—like the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
So what exactly would the new law do?We must remember that it was inaccurate information and propaganda by the Bush administration that got us into the Iraq war in the first place. The result! "1,455,590" dead Iraqis and 4,801 dead U.S. soldiers.
See the links below to see the figures for yourself:

Propaganda is detrimental to our society, it gives us an illusion of freedom when in fact we are misled.

A series of emails released Friday show what activists describe as "collusion" between U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman and Wall Street executives to push for the passage the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).
The emails (pdf), obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by the group Rootstrikers, which organizes against money in politics, include a message to Froman from a managing director at Goldman Sachs urging them to push for "robust commitments" on Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions—which allow private corporations to sue governments for perceived loss of profits—to be included in the divisive trade deal.
"I wanted to underscore how important it is for the financial services industry to get robust commitments on ISDS in the agreement... denying our industry the same rights as enjoyed by every other sector would be terribly unfortunate," the email states.
Another mentions it would be "good for the U.S." if lawmakers in U.S. Congress passed Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), also known as "fast track," which would allow the president to send trade deals to the House and Senate for a yes-or-no vote, rather than allowing them to make amendments to the agreements.
"Will do what I can to assist," reads the email from the Goldman Sachs lobbyist, sent in February 2015—just a few months before the Senate passed TPA in what opponents called a "great day for corporate America."
Froman responded that they would assign a staff member to be in contact with Goldman Sachs' lobbyist team, and that they would "welcome the chance to pick your brain" on the equally controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).

Rootstrikers—which is part of a newly launched financial reform coalition called Take On Wall Street—also noted that Froman, then chief of staff to the Treasury Secretary, was "instrumental" in the 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which created a firewall between the investment and commercial banking sectors, and has maintained a friendly relationship with the financial industry during their time as trade rep.
As the American Prospect reported in June 2015, under Froman's leadership, "more ex-lobbyists have funneled through USTR, practically no enforcement of prior trade violations has taken place, and new agreements like TPP are dubiously sold as progressive achievements, laced with condescension for anyone who disagrees."
Kurt Walters, campaign director at Rootstrikers, said Friday, "Wall Street knows it can get favors in closed door negotiations that could never survive the light of day in Congress. One thing has been consistent during Michael Froman's frequent trips through the Wall Street-to-Washington revolving door: He's repeatedly used their official positions to deliver for their friends at the biggest banks on Wall Street."
“It's fair to ask whether Froman is negotiating on behalf of the American public or to benefit the financial sector that gave them a massive golden parachute bonus upon their shift from Citigroup executive to U.S. Trade Representative," Walters added, noting that Froman received more than $4 million upon leaving Citigroup in 2013.
Froman repeatedly ignored calls by Rootstrikers to release the emails as public opposition to TPP began to grow in recent years. A USTR representative said in 2015 that Froman has "been very clear, on repeated occasions, in public and in private, that this administration will do nothing that puts at risk the Wall Street reforms."
SPOKANE, Wash. – A couple of Spokane home renovators could be getting their own show on HGTV after their show premiere this Sunday.
The show follows two friends and business partners Susannah Stoltz and Carolina Johnson who have been flipping houses here in Spokane.
Their pilot premieres this Sunday and it features a home in the Perry District they renovated already in the winter. The focus of the show is to revitalize Spokane classic homes through the duo's vintage upcycling twist. They try and do all of these changes while staying under a certain budget and selling their house at a target price.
If enough people watch the pilot episode, HGTV could film 12 more episodes with the two.
"It would be a big deal if we went to series. It will highlight Spokane," Johnson said.
"Yeah that's one of the things that HGTV liked about this concept is that they don't really have a show in the PNW, and we want to show off where we live," Stoltz said.
Here is the description for the first episode on HGTV.com:
Friends for over a decade, these two team up to completely transform a run-down and abandoned bungalow in the Perry District using salvaged vintage pieces and some creative upcycling. Susannah & Carolina work through unforgiving weather, asbestos contamination, and a strict budget to bring this 100-year-old house back to its original charm with some extra edge. Will these challenges keep them from staying on budget and selling this house at their target price?
The show premiers this Sunday at noon on HGTV. Check your cable provider to watch.
Here is the description of the show from HGTV.com:
Friends and business partners Susannah Stoltz and Carolina Johnson are taking old, forgotten bungalows and giving them a total makeover in their Pacific Northwest city of Spokane, Washington. From wrought iron chandeliers to salvaged cabinets and old driftwood, these vintage hardware-loving ladies are salvaging anything they find, creating beautiful designs with reclaimed materials and giving these classic homes a brand-new life.
CBOE Trading Volume Reached Records In October
by CBOE.com
The Chicago Board Options Exchange is the largest US options exchange and creator of listed options. It trades under (CBOE), which includes its CBOE Futures Exchange and other subsidiaries.
[BigTrends.com note: The growth of options trading continues, as these vehicles are a great way for investors large and small to utilize leverage, diversify and take various positons such as hedges. This is occurring even while stock trading volume on the whole is not rising (other than ETFs, which continue to grow as well). Certainly the downmove and volatility we saw in October contributed to this strong rise in options volume (people tend to buy Puts for protection in large numbers when the market falls), but this trend has been ongoing for many years regardless.]

At first I thought it was a wooly aphid so I looked it up and it didn't look right. Then I thought maybe it was a mealy bug so I looked that up. Nope… but it did send me down the right track. This is the larval stage of the Mealy Bug Destroyer. It's a species of ladybug and a predator of mealy bugs, aphids, soft scale insects, thrips, mites and cockroach eggs. You can see the aphids that it's after in the picture as well. They're out of focus but they're the brownish-black bugs in front of the Mealy Bug Destroyer Larvae.
Then I saw a picture of it's adult form online and I realized I had taken a picture of one of them earlier that day on one of my Mexican Butterfly Milkweeds. A tiny black beetle with an orangish head and posterior. I didn't even know Mealy Bug Destroyers existed till about 20 minutes ago. It's common in Texas and all over the US. Here's the adult stage. I'll try and get a clearer picture tomorrow because it's dark out now.
I actually planted the milkweed to attract oleander aphids as a food source for ladybugs. Oleander aphids stick to oleander and milkweed so there's no worry about the aphids spreading to the rest of your garden. I guess it's working.
Tailors' benches, each with a built-in sewing machine, line the wall of a long room in the Beirut Souks, in addition to tower shelves packed with rolls of fabric in a variety of vibrant hues. At Creative Space Beirut clients can select a piece of cloth, and then watch as a tailor begins to cut and sew a custom-made garment.
A new addition to the Souks, Creative Space Beirut, a nongovernmental organization founded in 2011, runs a free three-year fashion program for underprivileged students. Its presence in the Souks is part of a new initiative called Khan Al Joukh, which is bringing together local designers and artisans to create links to the city's pre-war past.
Prior to Lebanon's 15-year civil war, which devastated the city and took more than 120,000 lives between 1975 and 1990, Beirut's lively souks were the heart of the city. Rich and poor alike wandered the narrow alleyways where local tailors plied their trade and small shops hawked fresh flowers, household items, vegetables, food, clothes and jewelry.
After the war, the reconstruction of downtown Beirut was entrusted to the Lebanese Company for the Development and Reconstruction of Beirut Central District — a controversial public-private joint-stock company known as Solidere — which expropriated the land, offering shop owners shares in the company in exchange for their property rights. Beginning in 1994, Solidere demolished vast swathes of the war-damaged medieval souks, leveling the land with bulldozers.
Where the old souks used to stand, a new project began to take shape. The Beirut Souks opened in 2009, housed in a new multistory building filled with corridors of shops supposedly mimicking the layout of the traditional souks. Although each section was named for one of the pre-war souks, the $300 million project was stripped almost entirely of local context. A vast shopping mall, it houses international high street brands such as Zara and H&M, along with high-end designers including Emporio Armani and Louis Vuitton, and attracts a wealthy elite.
Launched Nov. 24, Khan Al Joukh marks a new direction in Solidere's vision for the Beirut Souks. Occupying seven empty spaces in the area known as the Gold Souk, home to high-end jewelry shops, the new project brings together local designers and artisans who have been offered rent-free spaces in which to work and sell their designs for a period of one to two years.
“We worked on the concept of the khan as a place for exchange and trade. Before the war there used to be a street in Beirut called Souk Al Joukh with tailors and embroiderers, so we wanted to initiate a modern approach toward the idea of the souk and the khan where you generate a kind of community interaction,” one of the organizers of the project told Al-Monitor, asking not to be identified as they do not have permission to speak to the press. “The idea was to create a fashion and textile destination where there are not only boutiques but also ateliers and workshops.”
Chrystele Karam, one of the designers invited to take part in Khan Al Joukh, sees the new initiative as a link to the past. “Things are made in front of you and that was an aspect of the souks that was lost when the mall was created,” they told Al-Monitor. “Things are more alive now. It is giving a new aspect to the Souks and I think it is very good for Solidere and also for the collective memory of people who used to love Beirut for its old souks. Now they can see that coming back.”
Trained as an architect, Karam is the founder of Blocksfinj, a company selling modular furnishings made entirely of foam, produced locally in a factory owned by their family. Cut into blocks with curved or straight edges, it can be moved and connected like building blocks to create chairs, sofas and other furnishings for home and office spaces.
Next door is the two spaces occupied by Creative Space Beirut, which moved to the Souks from a small space in Mar Mikhael. The students attend lectures and work on their designs in one of the spaces, while the other houses the fabric store, workspace for tailors and a boutique selling Creative Space Beirut's in-house fashion brands, which help to fund their education program.
“Our main goal is to provide free creative education … but we also really believe in ethical fashion and we realize that we are operating in an industry that is extremely unethical,” said outreach manager Karina Gourlodava. They told Al-Monitor, “Our tailors receive living wages and ethical working conditions, which a lot of tailors in Lebanon and other countries do not have, so people see this ethical production before they get to the shop and see the clothes.”
Also taking part in Khan Al Joukh is STARCH, a nonprofit foundation dedicated to promoting young Lebanese fashion designers through an annual rotation providing support for four to six designers developing their debut collections. Their new boutique, STARCHed, sells locally made clothing and jewelry designed by 12 alumni of the program.
At Studio 2, Stephanie Nehme runs Lebanon's first textile pattern design studio, while Sahar Hafda creates handmade jewelry and home decor objects out of recycled paper. Nearby, Gray Gardens is a nursery selling house plants that come in custom-made pots.
The final space is occupied by Salim Azzam, an illustrator and storyteller who is selling white blouses and shirts embroidered with their designs by local Lebanese women. Their collaboration is intended to highlight the value of a traditional skill that is in danger of disappearing.
A week after the launch party for the new project, Karam said Khan Al Joukh is attracting a new crowd, among them people who want to support local talent. Like Souk el Tayeb, the popular farmer's market that enlivens the Souks each Saturday, they noted the project is helping to bring back some of the atmosphere and liveliness of the pre-war souks.
“A lot of people do not like Solidere because of what happened after the war and how they took over the Beirut Central District, and I am one of these people,” they said. “I am sad that the identity of Beirut was a bit lost with the intervention of Solidere but I'm very happy that they are trying their best to fix the image. I think this is a very good initiative and I hope that they will push it further. … It is the first time we really feel it is giving back.”

Songbirds may have “borrowed” DNA to fuel migration
The Audubon's warbler (shown here) shares the same mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with myrtle warblers.
A common songbird may have acquired genes from fellow migrating birds in order to travel greater distances, according to a University of British Columbia study published this week in the journal Evolution.
While most birds either migrate or remain resident in one region, the Audubon's warbler, with habitat ranging from the Pacific Northwest to Mexico, exhibits different behaviours in different locations. The northern populations breed and migrate south for the winter, while southern populations have a tendency to stay put all year long.
Evolutionary biologists have long been puzzled by research that indicates some Audubon's warblers share the same mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with myrtle warblers – a different species of songbird that migrates annually to the southeastern U.S., Central America and the Caribbean – even though they look dramatically different.
“Mitochondria are only passed down from mothers to their offspring,” says David Toews, a PhD candidate in UBC's Department of Zoology. “So it's a very useful marker for differentiating species. In this case, finding two species of songbirds sharing the same mtDNA is very surprising, so we set out to find out why.”
By analyzing genetic data and stable isotopes in feathers, and by measuring oxygen consumption of the mitochondria in their flight muscles, Toews and fellow researcher Milica Mandic pinpointed the precise geographical location near the Utah-Arizona border where the myrtle warblers' “wanderlust” genes displace the Audubon warbler's ancestral mitochondria. This region happens to also be the transition zone where we see a change in the migratory behaviour of Audubon's warblers.
“Because of its prominent role in reconstructing evolutionary relationships, people often forget that mitochondria actually have a very important function as the main energy generator of cells,” says Toews. “Our findings suggest that over generations, the Audubon's warbler may have co-opted the myrtle's mitochondria to better power its own travels.”
A map outlining the migratory behaviour of Audubon's warblers is available here. (Caption: This map from Toews, et al shows the breeding ranges, migratory behaviour and distribution of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in four groups of yellow-rumped warblers. New data from Toews and colleagues demonstrates that the area where there is a transition in mtDNA is also home to a shift in migratory behaviour, from residents to migrants.)
Every Kill A 'Good' Kill: How Police And The Media Cooperate To Disparage The Dead
from the 'past-performance-ALWAYS-indicative-of-this-thing-that-just-now-happened' dept
Cops kill a lot of people. Depending on who's counting, they've already killed between 385 and 470 people this year. This isn't to say that some of these killings weren't justified, but when details begin leaking out about the those killed, the amount of force in relation to the threat posed is often questionable.
Because no PD wants to look like the home of trigger-happy thugs, the media spin begins almost before the "suspect" has expired. Usaamah Abdullah Rahim, shot by Boston cops, was instantly memorialized by law enforcement and a compliant press with the following:
"allegedly radicalized by ISIS social media"
"may have been planning to attack police"
"preparing to launch an ISIS-inspired attack"
"wielding a machete"
"under 24-hour surveillance by the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force"
If Rahim was so dangerous, why didn't the constant surveillance result in any charges? If — as the media spent all day claiming — they were on the verge of executing a horrific terror attack, why didn't law enforcement agents have an arrest warrant or even search warrant? What was their intention in approaching them this way? Were they wearing uniforms, and — supposedly believing they were an ISIS operative eager to kill police — did they do anything to make them feel threatened?
Denise said [Detective Mike] Smith then told them about “this new trend in law enforcement now—it's called suicide by cop.” They said Smith explained “suicide by cop” is when suicidal people provoke the police in an effort to end their own lives.
They said Smith wouldn't tell their family where or how many times their son was shot.
Gurley has 24 prior arrests on their record, police said.
The man killed by Pasco Police Tuesday evening had a past run-in with officers that resulted in an assault conviction.
Tamir Rice's father has a history of violence against women.
People from across the region have been asking whether Rice grew up around violence. The Northeast Ohio Media Group investigated the backgrounds of the parents and found the mother and father both have violent pasts.
The police chief refused to comment on Robinson's criminal history or run-ins with police.
“I could but I choose not to,” they said at a press conference Saturday.
“I frankly think it is, for our purposes today, wholly inappropriate and I am not going to blemish anyone's character, particularly someone's as young as his.”
Madison Mayor Paul Soglin, who said they met with Robinson's family the night of the shooting, said officials aren't going to put the teen on trial.
“That's not what this is about. What this is about is finding out exactly what happened that night and to determine, then, responsibility,” they told CNN's “AC360.” “We know that they were not armed, and as far as the police chief and I are concerned … the fact that Tony was involved in any kind of transgression in the past has nothing to do with this present tragedy.”
As much as Koval and Soglin conducted themselves admirably, the media is so bound to the gutter that it couldn't bear the idea of not throwing dirt on the body.
"Wisconsin Circuit Court documents indicate Robinson pleaded guilty in December to an armed robbery that occurred last April."
Because the cops refused to smear Robinson, the media had to do its own dirty work and dig up whatever nastiness “court documents” might offer. And if CNN's smear isn't bad enough, try ABC's:
"Inside, Kenny found Tony Robinson, a 19-year-old who had previously pleaded guilty to armed robbery charges in 2014."
They could have described Tony Robinson as “a 19-year-old who was loved by their family, who saved kittens from a tree, who had a lovely smile and joy for life, who appeared to have had an unforeseeable psychotic breakdown,” but no. Instead, they described them as a guy who was guilty of armed robbery charges.
The "machete" turned out to be just a knife , albeit a "military-styleknife," because black knives are inherently more evil and dangerous than those in any other color. #blackknivesmatterWhat appeared to be a mishandling of a potentially-dangerous situation is now a fully-justified kill of a terrorist. Everyone is just supposed to take these claims at face value, despite the assertions raising more questions than they actually answer.Notably, none of the media outlets regurgitating police assertions bothered to probe the issues raised by these statements.This, unfortunately, is all too common. Disparaging the dead is the national pastime, in terms of police-press relations.A suicidal man wielding a knife is shot in their bed by police officers responding to a call to aline at a local-- in which their girlfriend stated they were threatening to hurt. Completely unprompted, this is what police had to say to the victim's mother Just like that, the dead man was posthumously awarded the department's "He Was Asking For It" award. Further details on the shooting were withheld, because a bloodstained bed with bulletholes in it hardly portrays the shooting victim as a "threat."Akai Gurley, shot in the stairwell of a New York City apartment complex, was committing no crime when they were shot. Rather, the officer who shot them was patrolling the stairwells with their gun out and needed little more than a startling noise to justify opening fire. What did the media lead with As if that mattered. The officer didn't recognize Gurley and assume they were looking for number 25. The officer couldn't evenwho they were shooting at, because the stairwell was unlit. The unprompted rap sheet delivery by police sources was CYA in the form of presumed guilt.When a Ferguson police officer shot an unarmed Michael Brown, the press led with what it had been fed: Brown had participated in a " strong arm robbery " (which was actually just shoplifting combined with an altercation with the owner). When an NYPD officer choked Eric Garner to death, the airwaves filled with mentions of their previous arrest record (for minor things like selling untaxed cigarettes) and even extended so far as to implicate the person who recorded the incident, who had "previous arrests" and the coincidental misfortune of a post-recording arrest for possession of a handgun.Feast your eyes on this aggressive spin attempt:But the (lack of a) devil is in the details. The sentence under the headline implying the takedown of a dangerous, police-targeting thug shows the "history" wouldn't even fill the unused space on a detective's business card past run-in. Singular. Hardly a "history."Can you possibly smear a 12-year-old who was shot to death within seconds of a patrol car arriving on the "scene?" You can certainly try Relevant how?[Police and police supporters] from across the region have been [trying to spin this shooting of a 12-year-old]. The Northeast Ohio Media Group [has obliged them].We're already skeptical of FBI claims that someone is "involved" in terrorist activities or has been "radicalized." The FBI has no one to blame for this perception but itself. The recent shooting that quickly turned an armed male into a terrorist on the prowl, operating at the behest of ISIS, is another in a long line of post-shooting justification attempts. In most cases, the officers involved know little to nothing about the person they've just killed. But that changes swiftly when an incident turns deadly. Suddenly, there's a killing to defend and every public record and every law enforcement database must be scoured to find that "justification." Somehow, a past conviction becomes current guilt, even if the victim was doing nothing illegal at the time and did little to justify the use of deadly force.Sometimes -- very, very rarely -- there are exceptions. A Madison, Wisconsin cop shot an unarmed man during an "altercation." The police chief refused to play the "smear the victim" game This was backed up by the mayor of Madison.Unfortunately, the media refused to join the police chief and mayor on the high ground.Even if law enforcement officials bite their tongues when faced with the opportunity to clear themselves and disparage victims, media outlets can't seem to help themselves. Too many media outlets ingratiate themselves with local law enforcement -- not only by rebroadcasting questionable assertions, but by digging up any potentially damning fact that law enforcement left untouched.

Aimé Fernand David Césaire (; French: [sezɛʁ]; 26 June 1913 – 17 April 2008) was a Francophone and French poet, author and politician from Martinique. They were "one of the founders of the négritude movement in Francophone literature".[2] Their works included Une Tempête, a response to Shakespeare's play The Tempest, and Discours sur le colonialisme (Discourse on Colonialism), an essay describing the strife between the colonizers and the colonized. Their works have been translated into many languages.
Student, educator and poet [ edit ]
Césaire was born in Basse-Pointe, Martinique, in 1913. Their father was a tax inspector and their mother was a dressmaker. They were a lower class citizen but still learned to read and write. Their family moved to the capital of Martinique, Fort-de-France, in order for Cesaire to attend the only secondary school in Martinique, Lycée Schoelcher.[3] They considered themselves of Igbo descent from Nigeria, and considered their first name Aimé a retention of an Igbo name; though the name is of French origin, ultimately from the Old French word amée, meaning beloved, its pronunciation is similar to the Igbo eme, which forms the basis for many Igbo given names.[4] They traveled to Paris to attend the Lycée Louis-le-Grand on an educational scholarship. In Paris, Césaire passed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure in 1935 and created the literary review L'Étudiant Noir (The Black Student) with Léopold Sédar Senghor and Léon Damas. Upon returning home to Martinique in 1936, Césaire began work on their long poem Cahier d'un retour au pays natal (Notebook of a Return to the Native Land), a vivid and powerful depiction of the ambiguities of Caribbean life and culture in the New World.
Césaire married fellow Martinican student Suzanne Roussi in 1937. Together they moved back to Martinique in 1939 with their young son. Césaire became a teacher at the Lycée Schoelcher in Fort-de-France, where they taught Frantz Fanon, becoming a great influence for Fanon as both a mentor and contemporary. They also served as an inspiration for, but did not teach, writer Édouard Glissant.
World War II [ edit ]
The years of World War II were ones of great intellectual activity for the Césaires. In 1941, Aimé Césaire and Suzanne Roussi founded the literary review Tropiques, with the help of other Martinican intellectuals such as René Ménil and Aristide Maugée, in order to challenge the cultural status quo and alienation that characterized Martinican identity at the time. Césaire's many run-ins with censorship did not deter him, however, from being an outspoken defendant of Martinican identity.[5] They also became close to French surrealist poet André Breton, who spent time in Martinique during the war. (The two had met in 1940, and Breton later would champion Cesaire's work.)[6]
In 1947, their book-length poem Cahier d'un retour au pays natal, which had first appeared in the Parisian periodical Volontés in 1939 after rejection by a French book publisher,[7] was published.[8] The book mixes poetry and prose to express Césaire's thoughts on the cultural identity of black Africans in a colonial setting. Breton contributed a laudatory introduction to this 1947 edition, saying that the "poem is nothing less than the greatest lyrical monument of our times."[9]
Political career [ edit ]
Cadastre (1961) and Moi, laminaire (1982) (1961) and(1982)
In 1945, with the support of the French Communist Party (PCF), Césaire was elected mayor of Fort-de-France and deputy to the French National Assembly for Martinique. They were one of the principal drafters of the 1946 law on departmentalizing former colonies, a role for which pro-independence politicians have often criticized him.
Like many left-wing intellectuals in the 1930s and 1940s France, Césaire looked toward the Soviet Union as a source of progress, virtue, and human rights. Césaire later grew disillusioned with Communism, after the Soviet Union's 1956 suppression of the Hungarian revolution. Aimé Césaire announced their resignation from the PCF in a text entitled Lettre à Maurice Thorez (Letter to Maurice Thorez). In 1958 they founded the Parti Progressiste Martiniquais.
Their writings during this period reflect their passion for civic and social engagement. They wrote Discours sur le colonialisme (Discourse on Colonialism), a denunciation of European colonial racism, decadence, and hypocrisy that was republished in the French review Présence Africaine in 1955 (English translation 1957). In 1960, they published Toussaint Louverture, based on the life of the Haitian revolutionary. In 1969, they published the first version of Une Tempête, a radical adaptation of Shakespeare's play The Tempest for a black audience.
They served as President of the Regional Council of Martinique from 1983 to 1988. They retired from politics in 2001.
Later life [ edit ]
In 2006, they refused to meet the leader of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), Nicolas Sarkozy, a probable contender at the time for the 2007 presidential election, because the UMP had voted for the 2005 French law on colonialism. This law required teachers and textbooks to "acknowledge and recognize in particular the positive role of the French presence abroad, especially in North Africa, a law considered by many as a eulogy to colonialism and French actions during the Algerian War. President Jacques Chirac finally had the controversial law repealed.[citation needed]
On 9 April 2008, Césaire had serious heart troubles and was admitted to Pierre Zobda Quitman hospital in Fort-de-France. They died on 17 April 2008.[10]
Césaire was accorded the honor of a state funeral, held at the Stade de Dillon in Fort-de-France on 20 April. French President Nicolas Sarkozy was present but did not make a speech. Pierre Aliker, who served for many years as deputy mayor under Césaire, gave the funeral oration.[citation needed]
Legacy [ edit ]
Martinique's airport at Le Lamentin was renamed Martinique Aimé Césaire International Airport on 15 January 2007. A national commemoration ceremony was held on 6 April 2011, as a plaque in Césaire's name was inaugurated in the Panthéon in Paris.[11]

Discourse on Colonialism-
Césaire's "Discourse on Colonialism"[13] challenges the narrative of the colonizer and the colonized. This text criticizes the hypocrisy of justifying colonization with the equation “Christianity=civilized, paganism=savagery” (2) comparing white colonizers to “savages” (3). Césaire writes that “no one colonizes innocently, that no one colonizes with impunity either” concluding that “a nation which colonizes, that a civilization which justifies colonization - and therefore force - is already a sick civilization” (4). They condemn the colonizers, saying that though the men may not be inherently bad, the practice of colonization ruins them (2).
Césaire continues to deconstruct the colonizer, and ultimately concludes that by colonizing those white men often lose touch with who they were, and become brutalized into hidden instincts that result in the rape, torture, and race hatred that they put onto the people they colonize (2). They also examine the effects colonialism has on the colonized, stating that “colonization = ‘thing-ification'” (6), where because the colonizers are able to “other” the colonized, they can justify the means by which they colonize.
The text also continuously references Nazism, blaming the barbarism of colonialism and how whitewashed and accepted the tradition, for Hitler's rise to power. They say that Hitler lives within and is the demon of “the very distinguished, very humanistic, very Christian bourgeois of the twentieth century.(3)
Césaire originally wrote their text in French in 1950, but later worked with Joan Pinkham to translate it to English. The translated version was published in 1972 (1).

A custom gun manufacturer from Texas called Precision Syndicate modded a Glock handgun to resemble the famous zapper gun that came with the original Nintendo Entertainment System. Like the zapper, the Glock is white and grey with red accents. It's a pretty neat modification, but given how some folks feel about firearms in America, the gun maker has come under fire (not literally, of course).
Over on the manufacturer's Facebook page, many people left negative comments regarding the gun, with some expressing concern that children may mistake it for a toy. Although there were also others who thought the design was clever and wanted one of their own, Precision Syndicate released a statement today which reveals that the Glock is a one-of-a-kind and won't be mass produced.
“In light of the ‘Nintendo Glock' drama, we feel that the media and our fans need to know that this firearm will not be mass produced nor will it ever be,” said the gun manufacturer on Facebook. “This is a one off custom build for a friend of ours. Due to the thousands of emails and messages we have received in the past two days we have been unable to contact everyone in a timely manner, please be patient we will get to you as soon as possible. Thank you all for your support! Oh, and please.. keep your guns locked up and away from children, it's common sense.”
I've heard of fake guns that are made to resemble real firearms, but this is the first time I can think of where a real gun was made to look like a fake one. Like I said at the beginning of this post, this is a cool mod, but I can understand why folks would be upset over its existence. However, since this specific gun is the only one that will be created by the manufacturer, there is ultimately nothing to be concerned over.

The functional prototype
The functional prototype
Our device consist of mechanics and electronics. The mechanics are often overlooked, the CNC-aluminium prototypes in our Kickstarter video have taken over four months to get to the current stage. The result is a beautiful well designed consumer electronics-level enclosure.
Early Testboards
The electronics have taken even longer to develop. We have used evaluation kits and break-out boards to put together a complete set of components in order to test the electrical feasibility of the concept. We are currently working on the miniaturizing the electronics. So that all the components of our current working prototype fit in the designed enclosure.
What does the functional Prototype do?
The functional prototype does everything the final docking station will do: transfer USB 3.0 data, connect 3 USB 3.0 devices, charge an iPad and transfer Mini Displayport.
Miniaturizing the electronics
We have made a circuit board design that fits all the components into a very tiny package.
International taxes and shipping
As long as our products pass the standard quality test for a country or region, we are shipping to the entire world. The box we ship is a gift itself, from us to you, with a little surprise in it.
Production Schedule
Things tend to take more time than you hope, doesn't it? We have a pretty conservative schedule laid out for us. Roughly, it looks like this:
May – Finalizing design and construction of the MacDock
– Finalizing design and construction of the MacDock June – Start CNC testing, do batches of electronics
– Start CNC testing, do batches of electronics July – Product tests, certification and finding fulfillment partner
– Product tests, certification and finding fulfillment partner September – Start production of final version
– Start production of final version October – Start shipping the first MacDocks to our earliest backers
The woodpecker circled before landing on our 39-foot sailboat with a weary flap of wings that made clear that it was no pelagic. The bird perched on Firefly's preventer, the line that stops the boom from jibing, and rested, eyes drooping, as we hurtled south in the September nor'easter. We were 100 miles from terra firma, leaving New England behind and heading toward Delaware Bay.
The bird's markings—polka-dot belly, yellow underwings, splash of red, and black moustache—confirmed its identity, but was this male yellow-shafted flicker (Colaptes auratus) hailing us in trust or defeat? Was our encounter accidental, or had Firefly's winglike sails sent some empathic signal that beckoned? Bird and sailor intersect not infrequently in midocean, but when the twain meet, salvation or death hang in the balance. Who saves whom is a question of luck: Those venturing too close to Steve Callahan, adrift in a life raft years ago, contributed all too materially to their now-famous survival.
Migration is nothing new to birds, yet the trip doesn't always go as planned. Proof of this lies in the quantity that arrive exhausted aboard ships and offshore oil rigs, and who's to say this isn't the tip of the iceberg? How many are doomed for missing the proverbial needle in the haystack? In different parts of the world, Leo, my husband, and I have transported many an avian hitchhiker, including cattle egrets (east of the Carolinas), swallows (in the Bahamas), pigeons (in the North Atlantic), bats (off French Guyana), and hoopoe (off West Africa). Alas, many perished after alighting, for try as we did to tempt them with nuts, seeds, or fresh water, the treats remained untouched. One minute they acted bold, hopping within reach or sleeping atop the off watch; the next, they lay dead. If these birds could speak, such tales they'd recount.
The flicker moved to a spot under the dinghy stored upside-down on deck, where they were sheltered but hidden from cockpit view, and as the hours passed, we had no way of knowing if they remained alive, had died, or was taking their chances by resuming their journey after a brief respite. At our change of watch, I noticed the bird had reappeared and was now resting on a nearby life ring aft of the steering wheel.
Closer inspection revealed a moustache-less yellow-shafted flicker: a female!
Monogamous, flickers couple for life. Was they their mate? Had they been travelling as a pair? Or were they caught out separately and an entire flock dispersed by the same storm, as happens? I'd never know. One thing for sure: They were out of their element. Though Firefly skirted the limits of the Atlantic flyway, one of four North American migratory routes, the passage took us well seaward of stopover sites along the New Jersey coast. The female kept to the life ring, awash in spray from breakers but safe. They eyed the helmsman while pecking the antenna and flicking their tongue at imaginary ants. Although pitching as if in a rodeo, they showed no sign of leaving.
I wondered how the flickers lost their bearings. Wind and ocean are powerful forces, capable of diverting bird and boat hundreds of miles off course.
My guide for European birds by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds includes a section on “Vagrants;” it identifies rare accidentals, including flickers, arriving in the United Kingdom from Asia, North America, and Africa.
How far the migrants drift and whether they make it across an ocean depend on both external and internal factors: Fledglings are more apt to founder, making errors in navigation, and climatic change promises to worsen the situation.
But weather proves no less destructive to seabirds near land: In the U.S. Virgin Islands, Hurricane Hugo swept up pelicans and trapped them in the eye, where they flew round and round under blue skies until they died of exhaustion.
Firefly closed in on New Jersey, and we expected to round up into the bay by midnight. The closer we got, the better the flickers' chance of reaching shore in the gale-force conditions. Cape May and Delaware Bay abound in sanctuaries, and I knew that this female, and male, if they were still aboard, would sense Firefly's proximity to land and make a beeline for the coast off our beam.
But did they have the strength, and could they do it in the dark?
Sure enough, although we never caught the actual flight—navigating this busy approach demands attention—come nightfall, the female was gone.

North American and European utilities are phasing out old coal plants, Coal Swarm survey shows, as Asian companies dominate new development
By Megan Darby
One in seven coal plant owners worldwide fully or partially phased out their coal fleets between 2010 and 2017.
The first ever global survey of coal phase out plans, released on Wednesday by data trackers Coal Swarm, revealed two different trajectories as the industry collapses in the west but marches on in Asia.
Out of 994 companies with coal plants, 139 closed at least 20% of their capacity, predominantly in north America and western Europe, with 71 retiring their coal fleets completely.
A parallel report by Greenpeace identified 23 cities, regions and countries implicitly or explicitly phasing out coal burning for power.
Together, they show a rapid shift in the politics and economics of coal, researchers say. “Five years ago, nobody was forecasting this,” Greenpeace analyst Lauri Myllyvirta told Climate Home News, “so in that sense, things are moving incredibly fast”.
At the same time, the data shows 303 first-time coal plant developers are actively pursuing projects, with Asian companies dominating. Interest persists despite a recent clampdown on excess capacity in the two biggest markets: China and India.
In the US, where president Donald Trump is promising to put coal miners back to work, several prominent utilities are steering in the opposite direction.
AES, Berkshire Hathaway, Duke, NextEra Energy, NRG Energy and PSEG have retired 12-77% of their coal capacity in the last eight years, the report shows. Of these, only AES has plans to build a new plant – in the Philippines.
California went coal-free in 2014 and five states are expected to follow by 2025, regardless of Trump's planned rollback of curbs on coal burning.
Some European majors have changed their names or structures to signify a break from the fossil-dominated past. E.on split its declining thermal power business Uniper off from its renewables business while Dong (an acronym referring to its origins in oil and gas) this month rebranded as Ørsted. Iberdrola retired 82% of its coal fleet.
Eight EU countries including the UK and France have declared plans to quit coal by 2030 or sooner. Last week, the Netherlands' newly formed coalition government confirmed it would close three brand-new coal plants early to meet climate targets. The UK and Canada last week announced they would form an alliance of nations who have committed to phasing out coal power.
“In Europe, US, Canada, you can really see companies running away from coal,” said Carlos Fernandez-Alvarez, senior energy analyst at the International Energy Agency, commenting on the trends.
The outlook for Asia, which is critical to meeting international climate goals, is more complex.
Coal Swarm highlights that of the 681 first-time coal developers it studied, 56% shelved or cancelled their projects. This is presented as evidence that appetite for the sector is dwindling.
Fernandez-Alvarez said a 56% project drop-out rate was not unusual for large scale energy infrastructure. After a decade of surging coal development in Asia, it was “a big change” to see the trajectory flattening out. But “this is very far from the end of coal,” they added.
The IEA has revised down its growth forecasts for coal in recent years, “but not that dramatically”, said Fernandez-Alvarez. Its central scenario still predicts a slight increase in coal demand over the coming decades.
China slashed the number of construction permits issued to coal power projects 85% between 2015 and 2016, Greenpeace notes.
India is seeing a finance squeeze for coal, as cheap solar power shakes up the market. Its Central Electricity Authority estimates plants currently under construction will be sufficient to meet demand until 2027.
“The markets that have been driving growth have been overbuilt and are really not seeing demand for coal-fired power growing anywhere near as fast as planners imagined,” said Myllyvirta.
“If you look at how competitive renewables are already now in India – both wind and solar are able to bid lower [prices] than new coal plants… a rebound [for coal] in ten years is not really a worry.”
Still, China's five year plan aims to cap coal power capacity at 1,100GW in 2020, allowing for a 150GW increase from today's level. For comparison the US, with the world's second biggest coal fleet, has less than 300GW.
Of the ten biggest developers of plants in pre-construction planning globally, six are Chinese, two Indian, one Indonesian and one Thai.
Today, the commercial exploitation of outer space appears to be a growth area. Barely a week goes by without a satellite launch somewhere on the planet. SpaceX has a gigantic order book and a contract to ferry astronauts to the ISS, probably starting in 2018; United Launch Alliance have a similar manned space taxi under development, and there are multiple competing projects under way to fill low earth orbit with constellations of hundreds of small data relay satellites to bring internet connectivity to the entire planet. For the first time since the 1960s it's beginning to look as if human activity beyond low earth orbit is a distinct possibility within the next decade.
Kessler Syndrome, or collisional cascading, is a nightmare scenario for space activity. Proposed by NASA scientist Donald Kessler in 1978, it proposes that at a certain critical density, orbiting debris shed by satellites and launch vehicles will begin to impact on and shatter other satellites, producing a cascade of more debris, so that the probability of any given satellite being hit rises, leading to a chain reaction that effectively renders access to low earth orbit unacceptably hazardous.
This isn't just fantasy. There are an estimated 300,000 pieces of debris already in orbit; a satellite is destroyed every year by an impact event. Even a fleck of shed paint a tenth of a millimeter across carries as much kinetic energy as a rifle bullet when it's traveling at orbital velocity, and the majority of this crud is clustered in low orbit, with a secondary belt of bits in geosychronous orbit as well. The ISS carries patch kits in case of a micro-particle impact and periodically has to expend fuel to dodge dead satellites drifting into its orbit; on occasion the US space shuttles suffered windscreen impacts that necessitated ground repairs.
If a Kessler cascade erupts in low earth orbit, launching new satellites or manned spacecraft will become very hazardous, equivalent to running across a field under beaten fire from a machine gun with an infinite ammunition supply. Sooner or later you'll be hit. And the debris stays in orbit for a very long time, typically years to decades (centuries or millennia for the particles in higher orbits). Solar flares might mitigate the worst of the effect by causing the earth's ionosphere to bulge—it was added drag resulting from a solar event that took down Skylab prematurely in the 1970s—but it could still deny access to low orbit for long enough to kill the viability of any commercial launch business. And then there's the nightmare scenario: a Kessler cascade in geosynchronous orbit. The crud up there will take centuries to disperse, mostly due to radiation degradation and the solar wind gradually blowing it into higher orbits.
So here's my question.
Postulate a runaway Kessler syndrome kicks off around 2030, at a point when there are thousands of small comsats (and a couple of big space stations), ranging from very low orbits to a couple of thousand kilometers up. Human access to space is completely restricted; any launch at all becomes a game of Russian roulette. (You can't carry enough armor plating to protect a manned capsule against a Kesseler cascade—larger bits of debris, and by "large" I mean with masses in the 0.1-10 gram range—carry as much kinetic energy as an armor-piercing anti-tank projectile.) Unmanned satellites are possible, but risk adding to the cascade. So basically we completely lose access to orbit.
There are some proposals to mitigate the risk of Kessler Syndrome by using microsats to recover and deorbit larger bits of debris, and lasers to evaporate smaller particles, but let's ignore these for now: whether or not they work, they don't work unless we start using them before Kessler syndrome kicks in.
So, suppose that with the exception of already-on-orbit GPS clusters and high altitude comsats, we can't launch anything else for a century. What effect does it have on society and geopolitics when the sky goes dark?

So it's been a month since my last chapter release… I am very sorry to tell you that I will not be planning to go on translating Pivot of the Sky, at least in the future I can see. It's going to have an indefinite period of hiatus…
There are many reasons behind this. The major one is my release speed. I am not capable to do more than 6k words a week, and thus it's hard to attract enough readers. This in return became a problem when I looked for a long-term, stable partnership with a dedicated editor. I am finally tired of seeking editors every few weeks. Another reason is from real life. I work in investment banking and recently my workload has increased significantly. I don't have time to provide translations with on par quality any more, and I don't want to lower the standard.
It's sad that Pivot of the Sky didn't become popular. I've made quite some mistakes when decided to start the translation. Perhaps it's just not English readers' cup of tea. For those who want to know what happens to Amon, there's a translation at lnmtl. If anyone wants to pick up this novel, there's no need to wait, in the condition that you contact me (pm Renardusud / Renardusud1 at NUF), and I will give you the translated setting pack and other useful resourses and references.
Anyway, thank you for your support and help all the way here. So long my friends.
Regards,
Renardusud

Most people are a complicated jumble of conflicting priorities, values, and reactions. Anyone who has worked with a homeless outreach, done marriage counseling, or worked with teenagers will tell you that the vast majority of people are messy. In a perfect world, things wouldn't be so difficult. It's not a perfect world. Not even close. Until we embrace the “messy,” ministry will be an unending exercise in frustration.
On a few occasions, I've had the incredible privilege of walking a couple through premarital counseling. Along with the standard bits of wisdom, one of the first things I tell them is not to worry about the wedding itself. The wedding is just a three-hour party. Just as no marriage is perfect, no wedding is perfect. The cake will fall over, the band won't show up, crazy Aunt Bertha will show up drunk. Invariably more than a few things will go wrong. Weddings are a lot like life, if you expect them to be perfect, then you're going to be disappointed. We're better off embracing the messy and flowing with it.
For some reason, many people who organize short term missions, like people who plan weddings, set some fairly unrealistic expectations for what they want to happen. It's good to work for the best, to have a quality and impactful trip. But more often than not when we go to serve others, it doesn't always work out the way we planned. Managing our expectations is important. We have a simple choice: We can become frustrated with the difficulties, or we can flow with it and enjoy the mess. We need to realize that God sees a much bigger picture and ultimately very little of what goes on is in our control anyway. Sometimes we're the mess.
Recently our ministry here in Baja was presented with a special opportunity to serve a local need. A family with three children were living in a small camping trailer with a small shed built next to it. Unfortunately, a small fire turned into a large fire and, although they got out safely, the family lost everything they owned. They are not believers; we saw this as an outstanding opportunity to demonstrate God's love.
As a side ministry here, we coordinate home construction for needy families in our community. We normally spend months planning a home-build, partnering with groups from the US who help with both funding and labor. The need of this particular family was immediate so we couldn't follow through with our normal system. We saw it as a wonderful chance for several ministries in our valley to work together to bless this family. At a hastily called meeting with various local ministry leaders, people brought what they could to the table to help this family. One ministry was able to help with some funding, one had some extra doors and windows, several helped with labor. It was inspiring to see everybody step up to help and how the odd mix of ministries worked together. In less than two weeks we were able to build this family a cute little house that was nicer than what had burned down. The body of Christ was working smoothly together to serve those in need. So what could go wrong? Remember, people are messy.
As the teams were finishing as much work on the house as we had resources for, the family realized it wasn't going to be as nice as they expected. No, we weren't going to be able to finish out the shower. No, we weren't going to be able to complete the interior paint or install the doorknobs. The family was given a home that was nicer than what they had before and their reaction was not one of thanksgiving. They were going to complain and push for more. Not exactly the response we expected or wanted. Very messy.
There is a very long history of ministry not turning out the way it's expected to. In the Gospel of Luke Jesus heals the ten lepers and only one returns to give thanks and glory to God. Jesus knew that was going to happen, we're not that bright.
The point of all this is that God almost never guarantees the outcome we are expecting or working towards. That's not the plan. God calls us to go and do the will of our Father and represent Him well. Being pleasing to God is more than enough. People very likely won't appreciate our efforts; they might not say “thank you.” The “right number” of people might not come forward at an outreach, the family we build a house for might not be happy with our work. If that bothers us too much we might need to examine our motivation: Are we doing this for the approval of men or of God? If we're doing it for the approval of men, maybe we're the ones bringing the mess to the party.
In missions, as in life, God sees a much bigger panorama. In looking back at the house we built that wasn't appreciated, I can see how God used everything for their purposes. We were called to serve, so we served, that should be plenty. We didn't receive thanks from the family, but we do believe God was pleased. It also leads to some great discussions: How often does God pour out Their blessings on us only to have us reject them, complain, or ask for more?
Go and serve, but always remember who you are truly serving. Embrace and enjoy the messiness.

"No dumping" signs in Burnaby don't seem to be doing much to deter people from illegally chucking their junk.
"This is the worst spot," said Michael Robertson, pointing to a vacant lot where an upside down sofa lies, and a few feet away, a part of a trailer is left behind.
Michael Roberston says there is new junk to be found on this vacant lot every other week. (Tina Lovgreen/CBC)
Robertson, who lives in an apartment complex near the site just off Sperling Avenue, said new items pop up in the alley every other week.
"I don't know why, but they always dump it here," they said. "People just see it once and think OK, whenever I gotta dump something, this is where I will go."
The City of Burnaby received 1,900 requests to deal with abandoned items in 2016, up 3.1 per cent from the year before.
Municipalities in Metro Vancouver spend $2.5 million picking up and recycling abandoned items each year. (Tina Lovgreen/CBC)
The issue of illegal dumping was discussed by Burnaby Mayor Derek Corrigan and city councillors at a meeting earlier this month.
"I think people need to be discouraged ," said Corrigan during the city council meeting on June 12.
They asked staff to look into stiffer penalties for violators.
"There is nothing more atrocious for people trying to keep their city clean than finding one of their beautiful parks has been soiled by someone dumping a load of garbage," said Corrigan.
"I want to know we can prosecute that to the fullest extent," they said.

Currently, Burnaby bylaw officers can ticket violators up to $200 on the spot, whereas in Vancouver and other municipalities the fine can go up to $500.
In other municipalities, the amount is much higher. In Surrey, it is up to $1,000 and in Port Moody, $2,000.
In the course of a year, municipalities around Metro Vancouver pick up around 40,000 abandoned items.
"Each year, it's costing those municipalities $2.5 million," said Paul Henderson, general manager of waste services for Metro Vancouver.
On top of that, municipalities like Burnaby that offer bulky item pick-up services for free spend another $2.5 million to collect and dispose of the items.
Rural regions in B.C. are also struggling with illegal dumping, since they have fewer resources to deal with the issue.
The City of Burnaby received 1,900 requests to deal with abandoned items in 2016. That's up 3.1 percent from the year before. (Tina Lovgreen/CBC)

Perhaps the most surprising thing about illegal dumping in Burnaby is that the city offers free pickup and recycling of bulky items such as stoves, TVs and mattresses.
Residents just need to schedule a pickup day either via phone or online and then leave their item curbside.
"Maybe they don't know about the services provided," said Dipak Dattani, the city's deputy director of engineering.
In 2016, Burnaby received 8,161 requests for bulky item pickups, an increase of 12.4 per cent from 2015 and recycled 5,781 mattresses and box springs in 2016, a 2.1 per cent increase from the year before.
In addition to reviewing the fines, city staff will also look at installing surveillance cameras at dumping hot spots.
Burnaby city staff are expected to present their recommendations to council in September.

Six decades after post-Hitler Germany outsourced its foreign policy to its Western allies, Berlin is again a diplomatic powerhouse. This week Chinese leaders and Syrian rebels alike are attesting to Berlin's clout.
In Beijing, officials are once again treating Angela Merkel as the real head of Europe on the sixth gala visit—the second this year—by the German Chancellor. And disparate elements of the Syrian opposition have just chosen Berlin, in tandem with Washington D.C., as the key venues for presenting their belated first coherent program for "the day after" strongman Bashar al-Assad is toppled.
Berlin's newfound international influence should not be equated with the unwelcome "renationalization" and self-interest that various American and European pundits accused Merkel of two years ago when they balked initially at bailing Greece out of its, and the euro zone's, financial crisis. At that point the commentariat tended to scold Germany for abandoning its 60 years of post-Nazi penance, exemplified by its ceding of military leadership to the United States and European political leadership to France.
Now that the Cold War has ended and the two Germanys are united, fears ran that a mightier Berlin no longer felt the need to play the model European. Instead, it was flexing its muscles in renewed self-assertion, without even hiding national interest under the cloak of European integration.
To be sure, there are some faint echoes of this indictment today as Merkel leads their high-octane delegation of seven ministers and 20 top business executives into a China that invests €1.2 billion in Germany (out of €10 billion in Europe as a whole), receives €26 billion investment from Germany, and gave Berlin a positive balance in total bilateral trade of close to €150 billion last year.
Thus, some European Union allies contend, Merkel's meetings with both President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and the quasi-joint Cabinet meeting with 13 senior Chinese ministers have the aura of an exclusive special relationship and upstage the forthcoming EU-Chinese summit.
Others, like artist Ai Weiwei, China's most prominent dissident—along with a Bundestag delegation that recently canceled its own planned visit to Beijing over China's treatment of dissidents—fault Merkel for subordinating human-rights issues to commercial deals.
Still others worry that Germany—which accounts for half of all EU exports to China, consumes a quarter of Chinese exports to Europe, and saw its exports to China boost its own growth by half a percent to reach 3 percent last year—may be getting too dependent on still-authoritarian China. This narrative was perhaps reinforced by the announcement in Beijing on Merkel's first day in town of €4.8 billion worth of contracts for Airbus, EADS, Volkswagen, Eurocopter, and other German export champions.
Yet these residual misgivings, voiced by Germans as well as European and American allies, now reflect normal jostling over the balance in legitimate policies rather than the broad former aspersions on German motivations. Now that Merkel has persuaded their taxpayers to foot almost a third of the cost of two expensive bailouts of Greece and other efforts to save the euro, the angst that resurgent Berlin might be trying to shape a German Europe rather than a European Germany has faded.
On the contrary, today there is a widespread hope that Merkel can be a trailblazer for Europe in China, especially since EU members have never been able to agree on a common strategic concept for relations with the world's rising great power and second-largest economy. In the near term, Europeans would like Merkel to persuade Beijing to join in the euro rescue by buying Spanish and Italian bonds. (No success on that score so far.)
More broadly, all of Europe expects to benefit from a surge in Chinese investment as Beijing seeks to break out of the middle-income development trap it now faces and expands new foreign investment beyond securing natural resources around the world. China is only now beginning to invest its large capital stock in advanced Western economies in ways that will help move it up the economic chain. Here Germany is no maverick, but could well use its Chinese contacts to help establish mutual guidelines for European interaction with China's mixed state and private firms. The Rhodium Group calls Chinese investment in Europe so far "trivial compared to the aggregate" U.S. and intra-European investment there. However, it anticipates total new Chinese foreign direct investment of a non-trivial $1-2 trillion in the decade up to 2020, with some $250-500 billion of this going to Europe in mergers and acquisitions and greenfield investment.
So far, so obvious. What is more striking in the cordial German-China relationship is its growing political aspect. Merkel is said to be able to speak frankly about sensitive issues with them interloculars. This time the frank talk consisted of urging Beijing to break with Russia and stop blocking United Nations Security Council action to halt the Syrian government's massacres of civilians. (No visible success on that score either.)
German commentators can't resist contrasting this subtle maturing in Berlin-Beijing relations with Germans' increasing disillusionment with Vladimir Putin's stagnant Russia. For a decade or so, with business people driving the trend, Germans hoped that post-Soviet Russia would see a need to modernize the country and decide, like China, that to do so they must cooperate with the West in investment, ideas, and managing conflict. They largely gave up that hope when Putin resumed the presidency and showed no desire to soften their Hobbesian view of relations with neighbors.
The down-to-earth Angela Merkel certainly doesn't call their relative neglect of Moscow and their warm reception in Beijing this week anything out of the ordinary. But as a welcome partner of the outgoing and presumably also of the incoming Chinese party chiefs, they might just be leading Europe's own pivot to Asia.

Following decades of virtually no progress on building a Relief Line to alleviate congestion on the Yonge Subway, recent months have seen Toronto City Planning spring into action. City Planning's preliminary study of alignments for the much-needed route was released in mid-February, setting out a clear preference for a Queen Street alignment to Pape Station. Ahead of March 9th's Executive Committee meeting, we take a look at the Relief Line plans so far, reviewing the recently identified preferred alignment along Queen Street.
The Corridor Evaluation compares six alignments—discarding a wider array of less realistic options—all of which would be routed along either King or Queen. From there, the King and Queen corridors were both studied in greater detail, with three options presented for each. The potential alignments were studied running to either Broadview or Pape, with an additional Pape alignment—via the Unilever site—also considered for both the King and Queen corridors.
An overview of the six alignments studied, image courtesy of the City of Toronto
A scoring summary compares the relative strength and drawbacks of each of the six alignments, each of which divert "a similar number of riders from the Yonge subway, south of Bloor." The Corridor Evaluation tallies the results of 50 criteria to create a comparative cost/benefit analysis for each option.
For starters, both routes to Broadview—via either Queen (A) or King (C)—were quickly discarded, as both iterations of the Relief Line to Broadview were identified as having the fewest benefits and the most drawbacks, with the lack of an inline interchange station with SmartTrack/GO RER cited as one of the crucial drawbacks.
Putting aside the Broadview alignments—which score badly overall—the more contentious analysis compared the impact of two interrelated factors in finding an optimized alignment to Pape Station. The comparative advantages of King (D1, D2) and Queen (B1, B2) alignments—both of which facilitate an interchange station at Gerrard and Pape with SmartTrack/GO RER—were analyzed, alongside the additional impact of adding a station at the Unilever site for either alignment.
The preferred 'B1' corridor, image courtesy of the City of Toronto
Of these options, the 'B1' Queen-Pape alignment (above) bypassing the Unilever site has been selected as the preferred corridor. Overall, a Queen alignment was preferred over the King Street options due to less "overlap with existing and planned public transit," with a greater separation distance from the SmartTrack/GO RER lines to the south, as well as the potential East Bayfront LRT. The Queen Street corridor has also been prioritized for its impact in achieving social equity goals, serving the Regent Park and Moss Park neighbourhoods more directly than a King alignment. Also, the lower cost of alignments avoiding the Unilever site—which would require a deeper tunnel under the Don River alongside additional soil stabilization costs—is also listed as a benefit.
For the B1 option, City Planning cites the intangible symbolic benefit that a City Hall station would have along Queen Street while providing "easy access" to the PATH system despite not spelling out where the connection would be made. A single station at Nathan Phillips Square, called the "psychological heart of the City" in the recommendation, would however make for long walks to either Osgoode or Queen stations for those wishing to change lines, instead of the quick transfers that an interchange station at each would provide.
An overview of the comparative analysis, image courtesy of the City of Toronto
Notwithstanding property acquisition expenses, the baseline construction cost for both the King and Queen alignments to Pape are estimated at $3.7 billion by the TTC. Both corridors would become more expensive with the addition of a station at the Unilever site, with costs projected to rise to approximately $4 billion. However, ridership estimates for both alignments are also higher when the Unilever station is added, while King Street options also post higher overall ridership numbers again. A report prepared for the City by Dr. Eric Miller shows the highest ridership figures are projected for a King-Pape alignment which includes a station at the Unilever Lands.
As noted by transit advocate Steve Munro, the City's evaluation of the 'B1' Queen-Pape "depends very much on the presumed presence of frequent SmartTrack service in the rail corridor." If that is found to be impractical," Munro continues, "then the relative importance of the RL changes along with its appropriate alignment to serve the core. This is particularly critical at the Unilever site which would have only SmartTrack serving it if the RL stays on Queen Street."
"In summary, the choice 'makes sense' in the limited context that a frequent SmartTrack service will actually be feasible and will be built," Munro concludes. "If SmartTrack cannot be provided on a five minute headway with a low fare, then the entire planning process will require a major rethink."
The ambitious transit network "recommended to be built within the next 15 years," image courtesy of the City of Toronto
Indeed, the preferred B1 alignment's strong reliance on SmartTrack could prove problematic given the questions that remain regarding the viability of John Tory's continuously revised campaign promise. In addition, the lack of concrete figures provided at public meetings so far—where attendees are given only the comparative charts—makes an open, transparent dialogue about the Relief Line alignments more difficult.
Furthermore, the "psychological heart of the city" at Nathan Phillips Square also seems an odd justification for the alignment when considered against the tangible, far-ranging benefits of new transit. Within the broader context of ridership figures, accessibility, and social equity, how much does having a subway station at "the heart of the city" really matter? Otherwise at the public meetings, the notion of building a network is voiced again and again, even while undermining a strong network by advocating for potentially long inter-line transfers near City Hall.
Alongside other elements of City Planning's comprehensive new transit network, the Relief Line plans are set to be reviewed by City Council later this year. However, the Toronto Star recently pointed out that critical information regarding many of the new plans is still to come, with a number of new ridership projections expected just two weeks ahead of the summer Council meeting. As quoted in The Star, Ward 22 Councillor Josh Matlow argued that the "11th hour" numbers would not provide a sufficient basis for a thought-out decision.
Yet, in City Planning's new vision of an integrated, symbiotic 'transit network,' each new initiative is considered within the larger framework of regional transit, arguably making individual ridership projections less important. (This holistic reasoning in part justifies the preferred Queen Street alignment, despite its lower overall ridership). Nonetheless, a more comprehensive comparative analysis of the plans is difficult without further information and without a more realistic understanding of which projects will actually be undertaken, raising the possibility that a preferred RL corridor was chosen too soon.
So, is tomorrow's vote on the preferred alignment for the Relief Line at the City's Executive Committee premature? There remain a few public consultations on the line, and there remains the online materials with the possibility of response from the public here or here, or via email at reliefline@toronto.ca, so the rush to move the discussion solely toward the B1 preferred option needs to be questioned. Without giving Torontonians enough information (few tangible figures) to properly consider the higher-ridership but more costly King Street alternatives, City Planning is arguably railroading the decision, with the public consultations on the Relief Line playing out more like briefings to prepare us for a pre-determined outcome. Torontonians deserve more fully fleshed-out information on the alternatives before any are thrown out.

6:30 - 8:30 PM
More information is available at the official Relief Line website. For those unable to attend the meetings, an online feedback form is provided.
If you haven't seen it, that is an article from yesterday's Huffington Post .
I know what you're thinking. Why would an openly Leftist publication declare Hillary has already lost the election?
But they aren't the only ones planting the seed that Hillary is toast.
There's been a lot of Sturm und Drang among the Enslaved Press this past week over Hillary Clinton.
From Politico to the Hill to the HuffPo, the news reports on the panic within the Democrat Party have been legion.
I smell a rat.
Democrats never admit defeat unless it serves their purposes to do so.
Always remember that.
For the Left, controlling the narrative is key.
So why are they indulging in such a defeatist narrative fifty days before the election?
Why the frantic wailing about an impending Trump landslide coming from Democrats and their dutiful Enslaved Press?
Sure, part of it is to create a reasonable facsimile of “voter enthusiasm” by terrifying the snot out of the Democrat base in order to scare them to the polls in November.
But I think there's more to it than that. There is a more immediate and pressing reason for creating the narrative that Hillary Clinton has already lost.
It's all about lowering expectations.
Next Monday evening is the first Presidential debate.
If the Democrat-supporting Enslaved Press is willing to indulge in a little hysterical panic over what a miserable candidate Hillary is, they're lowering expectations for the debate.
This way, even if Hillary is relatively unimpressive in next week's debate, the narrative can be spun like so:
Clinton's impressive comeback at debate dispels concerns over their prospects in November.
Team Clinton is well aware that there is a large percentage of undecideds out there who just might be swayed one way or the other after seeing Trump and Clinton debate. As a result, Hillary has put all of their eggs in the debate basket.
Just a month ago, Democrats and the Enslaved Press were confident Hillary would win the debates hands down.
But over the last several weeks, their candidate has experienced quite a few unforced errors.
Them disgusting “Basket of Deplorables” comment backfired on them in a big, BIG way. Rather than benefit her, it gave even more of a boost to Trump. Worse still, it further emboldened the enthusiasm on Trump's side.
Them very public collapse on September 11, and the subsequent lying about their health rattled everyone — especially the Enslaved Press.
Hillary's cratering poll numbers not just nationally and in battleground states, but states once thought of as Democrat strongholds have everyone in the Democrat Party concerned that their candidate can't pass muster.
And when Hillary is out there campaigning, their rallies are sparsely attended and hardly what you could call “rousing.”
Any confidence the Enslaved Press and Democrats had for Hillary's debate performance has all but evaporated.
By lowering expectations – by building up the sense that all is lost – the Democrats and the Enslaved Press can portray even a mediocre debate performance by Hillary as a knock-out win.
No matter how they do, Chris Matthews's post-debate panel can marvel about what an impressive turnaround Hillary managed in that debate.
Lowering expectations lowers the bar. The more depressing articles about “all is lost,” the lower the bar goes.
The hope is that by Monday evening, the bar is so low, even the sick, decrepit Hillary could step over it even without the assistance of a phalanx of body men.
Don't get me wrong. The Clinton water-carriers in the Enslaved Press are terrified at what a dreadful candidate Hillary has turned out to be.
But the only reason they would openly admit it is if it serves their purposes.
I'm convinced the purpose is to lower expectations for next week's debate.
Consider this.
If the Enslaved Press were strutting around like Mick Jagger and arrogantly claiming that Hillary is going to wipe the floor with Trump next Monday, what the hell are they going to say if their debate performance is mediocre?
How could they possibly spin the narrative in Hillary's favor?
But by lowering expectations, by openly fretting about Hillary's lackluster poll numbers and dwindling electoral college map, that same mediocre debate performance can be spun into one heck of a comeback.
The narrative is everything.
These guys know the momentum is with Donald Trump.
The only hope they have of giving Hillary's flagging campaign a much-needed shot in the arm is to create the illusion that the debate was their shining moment.
Since they really can't trust that Hillary will make the debate their shining moment, these hacks are simply lowering expectations.
That way, no matter how dismal a performance they give, they can take a victory lap. They can marvel at their amazing, come-from-behind win.
And milk it for days afterward.

Q: I'm a college student living in my parents second home while I go to school. They have let me rent out a spare room in the house to another student, but I was thinking I could make more money renting it out regularly on a website like Airbnb. My parents are worried, though, that this regular short term renting will affect their home insurance costs. Will it? How much more will they owe? Penny Pinching College Student
A:. Your parents are right to be hesitant for this reason, Penny Pinching College Student. The most important thing to do before renting a part of your home out on websites like Airbnb is to. Keep an eye out for clauses that get rid of liability for commercial endeavors. Those will be your biggest hurdle.

Getting The Extra Coverage
Most likely,, including travelers using your place as a hotel. On the other end, though, the websites might cover some of the cost if something happens. Lets stick with Airbnb as an example. Airbnb boasts a $1,000,000 Host Guarantee. This guarantee covers damages to your property from a guest. However, there are some limitations to this coverage.In other words,. On the other hand, if that inebriated person sues you for the cuts, scrapes, and bruises on their arm from breaking the window, you will not be covered by Airbnb or, most likely, your home insurance.With this in mind, Penny Pinching College Student, before you rent your room out to another college student, have them sign a contract beforehand. But, if you are still sold on the idea of renting out that extra room through sites like Airbnb, you might want to check with your parents to see if they have purchased an umbrella policy. With an umbrella policy , your parents can get more than the basic home insurance plan.But even then, your parents belongings might not be fully covered. Do they have fancy artwork hanging from the walls? A pool table? A medieval suit of armor? Well, if Joe Shmoe from Airbnb destroys any of these things,, and neither will your basic insurance plan. For these items, your parents will have to purchase additional coverage., which would give your parents money to replace it, in theory. The pricing of these plans vary based on your provider, but all of them are cheaper than a multi-million dollar lawsuit or the cost of a medieval antique.before listing it on Airbnb. You wont regret thinking it through.

It's been a whole year since we discovered unlicensed Plastic Surgery Barbie apps for kids that made wonder what the freaking heck is wrong with people, and now, hooray! Here comes another series of games to file under Kids Games That Make Us Want to Scream WTF, Throw Our Laptops, and Hit The Developers In the Head With Them. This time they are all free online games based on Frozen characters. Of course.
At FrozenGames.org–which lies in wait, heavily SEO'd for your unsuspecting children to search for that very thing–kids can enjoy the joys of unlicensed online games like Injured Elsa, which allow them to “wipe the blood, puss using tissue” among other delightful tasks. Similar to the Barbie apps, there are also games to let you fix Anna and Elsa's horrible acne and ugly hair, heal wounds of varying degrees of nastiness, and give them tattoos.
Olaf also appears, with varying degrees of man-alone-in-movie-theater-wearing-raincoat creepiness. I may never be able to look at them the same way again.
(And forgive me for not linking to any of them directly. Hopefully the screenshots will satisfy your curiosity.)
But wait, there's more! You can also play the Elsa Frozen Baby Game (the baby is not frozen) in which “our precious Elsa is now a doting mom and also should bottle supply their very own heavily made-up little princess.”  They are also known as a “baby woman” in the game description.
And then there's the ultimate: The Frozen Anna Give Birth A Baby [sic] game. In which you can help inject your favorite freckle-faced, teenaged hero with a hypodermic needle to put them to sleep, perform a c-section with a scalpel, use it to slice off the baby's umbilical cord, then heal their wound instantly with a magic wand. Just like in real life!
Parents should know that, should your kids come across sites like this one (and there are many similar ones too), besides the games themselves, there are tons of ads inappropriate for kids all over. That includes a banner featuring screenshots of other games which will pop up while your game is loading.
Mommy, why is that cartoon girl not wearing any clothes? And why is that man grabbing that other girl's butt?
As Rebecca Rose at Jezebel wrote, NOPE TO ALL OF THIS.
On the positive side (kind of), there is an Elsa's Ice Bucket Challenge game in the mix. Not that we should assume that the ad-heavy site is supporting ALS in anyway. Just, you know, appropriating an idea that raised millions for a cause that had nothing to do with teaching girls the magic of c-sections and puss-wiping.
The thing that gave me a smile at last though, is the line at bottom of the site that reads, we promise to adhere when using copyrighted content. We'll just let the legal team at Disney take that one.

Rex Tillerson Rex Wayne TillersonHeather Nauert withdraws their name from consideration for UN ambassador job Trump administration's top European diplomat to resign in February Pompeo planning to meet with Pat Roberts amid 2020 Senate speculation MORE's days at the State Department appear to be numbered.

The White House stopped short of denying the reports and refused to say whether President Trump still has confidence in their embattled top diplomat.
“When the president loses confidence in someone, they will no longer serve in the capacity that they're in,” said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
Sanders later said that “there are no personnel announcements at this time.”
Asked about the reports earlier Thursday, Trump would only say “Rex is here.”

State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert issued a more forceful denial, telling reporters that White House chief of staff John Kelly John Francis KellyMORE called Tillerson's top aide to shoot down the reports.
Nauert tried to portray an air of normalcy in Foggy Bottom.
They highlighted Tillerson's Thursday trip to the White House to sit in on Trump's meeting with the crown prince of Bahrain, and announced they would leave Monday for a five-day trip to Europe.
"He's heard these kinds of stories before,” they said. “He's just going on about their business.”
Thursday marked the latest humiliation for Tillerson, but the secretary of State has managed to remain in their role despite near-constant rumors about an early departure.
Just days ago, Tillerson's stock within the administration appeared to be on the rise, making it seem likely they would achieve their rumored goal of serving for at least a year.
Tillerson was a constant presence during Trump's 13-day trip to Asia and made a rare appearance in the White House briefing room last Monday to announce North Korea's addition to the U.S. list of state sponsors of terror.
But the latest reports had Washington buzzing that the former ExxonMobil CEO's widely expected exit — what some have dubbed the “Rexit” — is now imminent.
If Tillerson were ousted before the end of the year, they would become one of the shortest-serving secretaries of State in U.S. history.

Trump, however, has not yet signed off on the plan, according to The New York Times, which first reported it.
Pompeo has become known as one of the most loyal officials in the Trump administration, forging a strong bond with the president. Tillerson, in contrast, has frequently butted heads with Trump over personnel and policy.
Cotton has also been a vocal supporter of Trump's foreign policy approach.
The reports, which were attributed to White House sources, appeared to be a coordinated effort to shame Tillerson into resigning.
It's the culmination of months of tensions between Trump and Tillerson that has left the secretary of State virtually powerless.
The president has contradicted Tillerson on a raft of hot-button issues, from a regional dispute between Qatar and its Gulf neighbors to the Iran nuclear deal and the showdown with North Korea.
Tillerson and the White House have had constant disagreements about staffing decisions at the State Department, where many senior positions remain unfilled.
Tillerson also ruffled feathers at the White House by declining to send a State delegation with Ivanka Trump this week to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in India.
The Trump-Tillerson relationship had appeared to reach a low point in October, when NBC News reported the secretary of State called the president a “moron” behind their back following a major national security meeting at the Pentagon.
The State Department later denied the report, and Tillerson was forced to appear on camera to defend their relationship with Trump.
Trump responded by offering to compare IQ scores with Tillerson, but later offered them a vote of confidence.
The incidents laid bare the distance between Trump and their secretary of State, indicating to world leaders that they lacked influence at the White House and did not speak reliably for the president.
Many Democrats and career diplomats had hoped Tillerson, who is seen as a moderate on many foreign policy issues, would serve as a check on Trump.
Instead, they were incensed by the deep budget cuts and massive reorganization they tried to carry out at the State Department, moves they say hollowed out the agency.
“From a managerial perspective, they have been pretty much a disaster for the department,” said Ilan Goldenberg, a former State Department official who now serves as senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. “It's hard to imagine whoever comes after would possibly be worse.”
Key Republicans on Capitol Hill indicated they were not pleased with the White House's effort to dump Tillerson, but few made a full-throated case for them to stay in their job.

This time 'round, the company is working with the World Innovation Lab to create Qrio, a smart lock that lets you open doors with your smartphone. According to the pitch, it's the "world's smallest" device of its type and lets you share access to your home to anyone with the compatible app. The aluminum housing essentially clips over your door's existing furniture, the only DIY required being to stick a plate to the door to keep the batteries in place. The company promises that four CR123A cells will keep the aluminum-hewed hardware going for 1,000 days before you need to run to the store.
Qrio has already met its funding goals, but you can still pick up an early bird deal and save on the planned retail price of around 15,000 yen ($130) plus tax. Of course, those of you with long memories will also remember that this isn't the first time Sony's been involved with a product called Qrio. Back in the day, it was also the name of the company's not-so cuddly robot companion, although we'd have paid good money for a robotic door guard.
About
In The Big Time!, players take the roles of theater owners in Chicago during the Golden Age of vaudeville, from about 1905 to about 1915. The object is to make your theater the most spectacular in the city by booking the greatest and most diverse roster of acts that you can find (and afford!).
The game is won by achieving the highest score on the Success Track, which represents public approbation and goodwill. While money is an important part of running a successful theater, there've gotta be easier ways to make a living than dealing with a never-ending procession of ventriloquists, jugglers, and trained animals! No, you're in this business because greasepaint is in your blood, and you can't imagine a world without limelight.
In each of four turns, players bid on the right to select acts first and place those acts in their theaters. After your theaters are booked, you tally up scores to see who was the most successful. Good shows will drive up the reputation of your theater and influence the popularity of the types of acts that you book, but a flop can always set you back!
In The Big Time!, players take the roles of theater owners during the Golden Age of Vaudeville.
The game is played in four rounds, each representing one week of one month during this halcyon era.
Player Setup
Assign each player a Theater Playbill Mat according to their wont and place it in front of them, and place the matching Theater Marker beneath the Posterity Point track on the main board.
Dole out an allotment of Big Time Money to each player, four of each denomination to a total of $24. This is a fixed amount, and will not change throughout the four rounds of play.
Randomly place the six Act Type Markers on the starred spaces of the Public Opinion Track.
Lastly, give each player a Review Card at random. During the game, reviews will be assigned according to how well theaters perform, and are used to break ties. To offset the advantage given to unearned reviews during the first round, players receive bonus cash (Big Time Money cleverly marked with “BONUS” in red type) to be used for the first round only. The Smash gets an extra $3, the Boffo show $2, and the So-So show $1.
Setting Up The Booking Agency
Deal out a number of Headliners equal to the number of players plus one face-down, next to the "Coming Soon" slot in the Booking Agency (i.e., deal out five cards in a four-player game).
Deal out the same number of face-down Troupers atop each Headliner.
Lastly, deal a like number of face-up Troupers: one atop each stack next to “Coming Soon”, and in rows next to the "Now Available - P.M." and "Now Available - A.M." slots.
These Acts constitute the pool of talent from which the current week's Playbills will be constructed. Take a moment before setting your mind to the tasks before you to chortle over the delightful names and descriptions of the acts (...all of which are absolutely authentic, having been culled directly from vaudeville advertisements in vintage newspapers).
Book Your Acts
Each round is broken into seven Phases: In Phases 1 through 3 (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday), theater owners (that is to say: you and your fellows) send talent buyers to the Booking Office with fistfuls of cash to secure acts for the weekend's show.
When a Playbill is complete, four of the five acts that comprise it will be Troupers, and the remaining act will be a Headliner. As acts are selected for Playbills, they should be placed from bottom to top, overlapping upwards as new acts are added. In this way, Playbills end up with a vaudeville poster-style display, with a picture of the Headliner on top!
It's Showtime!
In Phase 4 (Friday night), shows open and Box Office returns are totaled; players total up values of the Playbills they've assembled. The highest scoring Playbill will yield the best Review! Leading to...
The Talk Of The Town
Come Saturday evening after the last curtain falls--that's Phase 5 to you and I--the heavy hand of Public Opinion falls upon us; acts involved with successful shows rise in popularity and acts that flopped fall in public estimation.
How'd We Do?
Phase 6 is a contemplative phase, a quiet Sunday morning when theater owners reflect upon their achievements and theaters are evaluated for their inclusion of popular act types, securing their reputations in perpetuity. (Read: Victory Points are awarded.)
Theaters will be fondly remembered for booking acts that were popular at the time! Each act type icon on a Theater Mat will score points according to its value on the Public Opinion chart: three points for acts in The Big Time, two points for acts in Hot Time, and one point for acts in Showtime. Small Time acts accrue no points for their bookers. Keep in mind that Headliners have two icons, and thus will always score twice.
That's A Wrap
Alas, Monday morning finds stagehands sweeping aside the detritus of bygone shows, making ready the theaters for another week's work. Brooms whisk away sequins and broken banjo strings, and shovels are put to use cleaning up after myriad ponies and monkeys and chorus boys. This is Phase 7, Cleanup, where Playbills are cleared in preparation for the coming week.
At the end of the fourth week's Scoring, whomsoever has amassed the most Posterity Points wins! Simplicity itself!

(Newser) – In a not-so surprising development, a woman in Italy has named their newborn son after the pope. In a more surprising development, they happen to be a nun. The 31-year-old in Reiti went to the hospital complaining of stomach pains and reportedly rejected the doctors' crazy suggestion that they were about to have a baby, reports the Telegraph. "It's not possible, I'm a nun," the Italian press quotes them as saying. They were right, they were wrong, and little Francis soon entered the world, reports the BBC.
The unidentified woman worked in an old folks' home, but the assumption is that they got pregnant on a visit to their homeland of El Salvador. "It seems they were not able to resist temptation," says the wise mother superior of their convent. Or former convent: The local bishop says she's getting the boot for breaking their vow of chastity. The diocese and local residents are collecting donations for the newly formed family. (Read more nuns stories.)
Data is currently not being treated as infrastructure. We need to change this.
Data such as statistics, maps and real-time sensor readings help us to make decisions, build services and gain insight. Data infrastructure will only become more vital as our populations grow and our economies and societies become ever more reliant on getting value from data.
Data infrastructure consists of data assets such as datasets, identifiers and registers, the standards and technologies used to curate and provide access to those data assets, the guidance and policies that inform the use and management of data assets, the organisations that govern the data infrastructure and the communities involved in contributing to or maintaining it, and those who are impacted by decisions that are made using it. Trustworthy data infrastructure is sustainably funded and is directed to maximise data use and value, meeting society's needs.
Data is as important as our road, railway and energy networks and should be treated as such.
We risk seeing data only as a tool for transparency, when it should also be an engine of efficiency and growth. We need to strengthen our data infrastructure.
Federal water bills would harm our salmon
Today, one of our state's most iconic local foods, chinook salmon, is in critical danger, threatened by drought and Congress.
This week, 39 leading Bay Area chefs and restaurant owners joined the Golden Gate Salmon Association in opposing antisalmon bills in Congress. Instead, we urge legislators to support rebuilding salmon runs.
Although many link this magnificent fish with rivers to the north, the most important California salmon habitat is closer to home. San Francisco Bay and its rivers represent the biggest salmon system south of the Columbia River.
Historically, this ecosystem produced millions of salmon annually. Young salmon emerge from the gravel in cold Central Valley rivers every spring. They spend the next few years in the ocean, returning to spawn where they were born.
Every year, the return of salmon is eagerly anticipated by California fishermen, restaurants and the public.
Tragically, during the past two drought years, nearly all wild salmon in some California rivers have been killed by high water temperatures. Because of shrinking salmon runs, the fishing fleets at Fisherman's Wharf and dozens of other ports face severe restrictions. Thanks to careful regulation, we still have salmon in our markets and on our menus, but it's scarce and expensive this year.
Unfortunately, some hope to take advantage of the drought, seeking to weaken protections for salmon to squeeze more water from vulnerable salmon rivers. We need to choose, they claim, between fish and people.
Bills in the Senate, S2533 by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and the House, HR2898 by Rep. David Valadao, R-Hanford (Kings County), threaten the future of California salmon by undermining legal protections for salmon and mandating maximum water pumping from San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. These proposals could not come at a worse time. Although Feinstein's bill has some positive provisions, both bills would imperil our salmon runs.
Those of us in the food community know we don't need to choose between fish and people. California salmon is among the world's most delicious and perfect foods. And salmon are essential to the families, businesses and communities that depend on them. Salmon link California's environment, economy and people.
Salmon don't have the choices we have during the drought. Farmers can install drip irrigation and plant less thirsty crops. Urban residents can replace lawns, and water agencies can reclaim wastewater. But salmon depend on the water we leave in our rivers and in the habitat we restore for them.
We can have strong salmon runs, a thriving fishing industry, reliable water supplies and a precious sustainable food source. The future of this remarkable fish is in our hands.

Vietnamese birth name Vietnamese Nguyễn Tân Đinh Hán-Nôm 阮伸丁
Philipp Rösler, GOM (born Nguyễn Tân Đinh; 24 February 1973)[1] is a former German politician who was the Federal Minister of Economics and Technology and Vice Chancellor of Germany from 2011 to 2013.[2] They were also Chairman of the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) from 2011 to 2013. Following the 2013 federal election in which the FDP left the Bundestag, Rösler announced their resignation from the chairpersonship. Born in Vietnam, Rösler was the first cabinet minister of Asian background in Germany.[3] Before entering politics, Rösler was a cardiothoracic surgeon.
Early life and education [ edit ]
Rösler was born in Khánh Hung, Ba Xuyên Province, in South Vietnam (now Sóc Trăng Province, Vietnam) on 24 February 1973.[4][5] No information regarding Rösler's Vietnamese birth parents is known. They were adopted from a Roman Catholic orphanage near Saigon[6] by a German couple who already had two biological children, and brought to Düsseldorf, West Germany, in a plane of children's rights charitable humanitarian organization Terre des Hommes[7] at the age of nine months.[5] They were raised by their adoptive father, who is a career military officer, after the couple separated when they were four years old.[8]
Rösler grew up in Hamburg, Bückeburg and Hanover, where they graduated from high school in 1992.[9] After training to become a combat medic in the German Bundeswehr (the Federal Defence Force), Rösler was accepted to study medicine at the Hanover Medical School. Following this, they continued their education at the Bundeswehr hospital in Hamburg. They earned their Doctorate in cardiothoracic surgery in 2002.[9] They left the service as a Stabsarzt (a rank for German medical officers equivalent to an army captain)[10] in 2003.[11]
Political career [ edit ]
State politics [ edit ]
Rösler in 2013
Rösler joined the FDP and its political youth organization, the Young Liberals, in 1992.[8] They were secretary of the FDP in the state of Lower Saxony from 2000 to 2004 and served as chairperson of the FDP parliamentary group in the Lower Saxon state assembly from 2003. From 2001 to 2006, Rösler was a member in the regional assembly of Hanover (district), where they were also deputy chairperson of the parliamentary group. In May 2005, they were elected an observer of the federal FDP executive committee. They received 95% of the votes, the best result of that party conference. At the state party conference in March 2006, Rösler was elected as chairperson of the Lower Saxon FDP with 96.4% of the votes; they succeeded Walter Hirche, who had decided to step down after twelve years at the helm. In April, 2008, Rösler was confirmed as the Lower Saxon FDP party chairperson, receiving 95% of the votes.
At the federal party conference in June 2007, Rösler was re-elected as a member of the party executive committee. The following month, they were elected to stand as their party's main candidate in the Lower Saxon state election in January 2008. In that election, they received 10.9% of the votes in their local constituency, Hanover-Döhren. On 18 February 2008, Rösler was appointed State Minister for Economic Affairs, Labour and Transport[12] as well as Deputy Minister-President in the cabinet of Minister-President Christian Wulff of Lower Saxony.
Role in federal politics [ edit ]
Federal Minister of Health, 2009–2011 [ edit ]
Following the 2009 national elections, Rösler succeeded Ulla Schmidt as Federal Minister of Health in Angela Merkel's second cabinet.[13]
Over the course of 2010, Rösler pushed through changes to the way drugs are priced on the German market as part of their wider-ranging health-care reform plans.[14] In January 2011, they asked German pharmaceutical companies to refrain from delivering anesthetic sodium thiopental to the US, a request they agreed to. Later that year, they declined a request from their counterpart, United States Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke, that Germany help out with thiopental as dozens of US states were facing shortages of a drug necessary in lethal injections administered to death-row prisoners.[15]
Vice-Chancellor and Federal Minister of Economics and Technology, 2011–2013 [ edit ]
Rösler succeeded Rainer Brüderle as Federal Minister of Economics and Technology on 12 May 2011 and Guido Westerwelle as Chairman of the FDP on 13 May 2011 and was also instated as Vice-Chancellor of Germany on 16 May 2011.[16][17]
On June 7, 2011, Rösler attended the state dinner hosted by President Barack Obama in honor of Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House.[18]
Rösler strongly supported the presidential candidacy of Joachim Gauck, originally proposed by the SPD and Greens, and reportedly secured their nomination by convincing their opposing coalition partner, the CDU/CSU, to back the nomination. That was seen as a step to demonstrate the independence of their party which was dramatically trailing in polls.[19]
As a consequence of the FDP's defeat in the 2013 state elections in Lower Saxony, Rösler offered to step down as party chairperson. The leadership decided that they would remain but not lead the party in the federal elections, instead acting in a team with Rainer Brüderle as top candidate.[20] Following the defeat of 2013 federal elections, when the FDP was for first time in its history voted out of the Bundestag, they stepped down as chairperson and retired from politics. Christian Lindner became their successor as leader of the FDP.
Life after politics [ edit ]
In January 2014 Philipp Rösler became a member of the managing board of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Switzerland, under the leadership of chairperson Klaus Schwab.[21] In late 2017, media reported that Rösler was to be appointed chief executive officer of New York-based Hainan Cihang Charity Foundation Inc., the largest shareholder of HNA Group.[22]

Honours [ edit ]
Notes [ edit ]
Kezia Dugdale has described the Scottish Parliament as the “gayest parliament in the world” as they admitted they had been “bowled over” by the support they had received since confirming they are in a lesbian relationship.
The Scottish Labour leader, who has previously avoided talking about their private life, tweeted their thanks to all those who sent their messages of support after they said they were “in love with a woman”.
 They are one of several high-profile political figures in Scotland to have come out. Ms Dugdale praised the reaction to their announcement and hailed the diversity within the Scottish Parliament.
They told the Fabian Society on Friday: ”I have a female partner. I don't talk about it very much because I don't feel I need to. I am generally calm, almost serene. I don't get easily stressed or battered. But I need a bit of stability to do that, and that means my private life is my private life.”
They described the response to their comment after a bruising weekend following their admission that it was “not inconceivable” that they could vote for Scottish independence if Britain voted to leave the EU. The remark led to claims that they were not capable of defending the Union.
HUBBALLI: Early this month, a young social development consultant from Ballari used their wedding card to spread the message of Swachh Bharat. Now, a farmer from Davanagere has adopted similar means to create awareness on rainwater harvesting.While farmers in their village are campaigning for their candidates in the gram panchayat elections and sweating it out in the scorching heat, H K Anandappa of Honnanayakanahalli village has a different concern: the water shortage in their village. To spread the message on saving water and recharging borewells, Anandappa has decided to use their son's wedding to drive home the point. Right from the card to the nuptials, the theme will be on saving water.The wedding card features catchy slogans like ‘save water', ‘drop of water is more precious than anything else', ‘use rainwater harvesting to recharge your defunct borewells' etc.He has also made arrangements to hold a workshop on the importance of rainwater harvesting on the occasion of the marriage of their younger son H A Kallesh on Wednesday at Santebennur. Before tying the knot, there will be a workshop where groundwater experts, including N J Devaraj Reddy, a Chitradurga-based hydrogeologist and founder of Geo Rain Water Board, will speak on rainwater harvesting and its role in recharging borewells. Other experts and farmers from surrounding villages will participate in the workshop and bless the newlyweds. Nearly 2,000 wedding cards have been printed at a cost of Rs 30,000.Anandappa told TOI, “I had borewells dug up in my five acres to grow horticultural and other crops, but all of them dried up as the water tables depleted. We faced a huge loss. We did not get a single drop of water even after we had dug borewells up to 500 ft deep. I then met groundwater expert Devaraj Reddy who advised me to adopt rainwater harvesting method. After I followed instructions, my luck changed and water filled my borewells. Today, I've been able to grow varieties of crops, including vegetables and other horticulture crops.”Anandappa said that many farmers are facing loss and not drawing any water from their borewells since they are not aware of rainwater harvesting. “I have to spend thousands to hold seminars or workshops to educate people about it, but I have decided to use the occasion of my younger son's marriage for this purpose. I have printed details of workshops and some catchy slogans on groundwater protection and importance of rainwater,” they said.A large number of people, mostly farmers, are attending their son's wedding. “Apart from our relatives, I have also invited farmers from surrounding villages to participate in the workshop and then bless the newlyweds. My efforts have been appreciated by all villagers and family members,” they added.Kallesh, the groom, is fully backing their father's initiative. “We don't want to see other farmers face the problems that we did. So we are creating awareness,” they said.
A young Arab man on Saturday afternoon stabbed and wounded a 65-year-old woman at the street market in Rahat, a Bedouin-majority city in southern Israel. The attacker quickly fled. Police announced that the stabbing was apparently a terror attack and that the victim was a resident of a kibbutz in southern Israel.
Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter
The scene of the attack in Rahat
Rahat Mayor Talal al-Kirnawi said a masked Palestinian who was in Israel illegally committed the terror attack. The mayor condemned the attack and said they believed there were about 7,000 people in Rahat illegally at any given time.
"We are appalled by this incident," said the mayor. "The young man apparently does not live in Rahat. It appears that this youth took the law into their hands and stabbed our neighbor, to whom we wish a speedy recovery. We demand that security forces apprehend this attacker and punish him. Coexistence here in the city and cooperation between residents of Rahat and their neighbors will continue. We must be strong and maintain the ties we have with our neighbors."
Witnesses gave police a description to assist in their search for the suspect. Initial reports during the minutes following the attack suggested that the suspect was a woman, but police soon announced that it was in fact searching for a male suspect.
Police at the market in Rahat after the attack
The victim was taken by paramedics for emergency medical treatment at Soroka Medical Center in Be'er Sheva. They told paramedics that they had been shopping in the market when they were attacked. The hospital indicated that they had been stabbed in the neck area. MDA said they were moderately wounded after the attack. After treatment in the trauma room and improvement the hospital said they were lightly wounded.
Also Saturday, IDF troops located seven backpacks at the location where two Israelis reported gunfire at their car on the previous night. No one was hurt and there was no damage in that attack. The Shin Bet and IDF are investigating.
Regina Austin (Penn) has posted to SSRN their book chapter, “Women's Unequal Citizenship at the Border: Lessons from Three Nonfiction Films about the Women of JuÃ¡rez,” forthcoming in Gender Equality: Dimensions of Women's Equal Citizenship, edited by Linda McClain and Joanna Grossman. Austin is the William A. Schnader Professor of Law and the head of the Program on Documentaries and the Law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.
Here is the abstract of Professor Austin's chapter:
There is no better illustration of the impact of borders on women's equal citizenship than the three documentaries reviewed in this essay. All three deal with the femicides that befell the young women of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, Mexico between 1993 and 2005. Juarez is just across the border from El Paso, Texas. Performing the Border (1999) stimulates the viewer's imagination regarding the ephemeral nature of borders and their impact on the citizenship of women who live at the intersection of local, regional, national and international legal regimes. SeÃ±orita Extraviada (2001) is an intimate portrait of the victims which illustrates why the private grief of their survivors should have been a cause for public national mourning. Finally, Battle of the Crosses (2005), the work of social scientists, offers a panoramic description of the complicated social terrain on which the JuÃ¡rez femicides occurred and their meaning was fought over. Together, the films suggest how borders are constructed and”performed”through law and law enforcement in ways that jeopardize women's rights as citizens. The films also show how women in turn challenge law and law enforcement to transcend the limitations of social, political, and economic borders and assert their right to equal citizenship.
Confronted with state intransigence in the face of the murders of dozens of young females, the women of JuÃ¡rez used their traditional female roles as a springboard to political engagement. Overcoming the debilitating effect of class and ethnic marginality, patriarchal mass violence, and governmental corruption and lack of accountability, the women turned back the state's effort to belittle the murders as private matters and the victims as deserving of their fate. The documentaries together provide a vivid case study that proves the importance of understanding the synthetic quality of borders and their relationship to women's equal citizenship in a globalizing world where borders can pop up anywhere and at anytime.
The full chapter is available here.

(Photo: Associated Press)
OLYMPIA, Wash. — About 1,000 gun-rights advocates, many openly carrying rifles and handguns, rallied Saturday outside the Capitol to protest a new expanded gun background check law in Washington state.
Organizers of the "I Will Not Comply" rally promised to exchange and sell firearms without conducting background checks during the daylong rally in opposition to the state's voter-approved universal background check law.
"We're going to stand up for our rights," rally organizer Gavin Seim said. "Our rights are not up for negotiation."
Initiative 594 passed with 59 percent of the vote last month. Geoff Potter, who served as a spokesperson for the pro-initiative campaign, said that the rally was "a very loud, but very, very narrow and unrepresentative view of what the people of Washington have clearly demonstrated they want on background checks and gun laws."
At an I-594 "violation station" people posed with rifles that weren't theirs, and a wedding party unaffiliated with the protest that was taking pictures on the Capitol steps got into the spirit.
Rally participant Brandon Lyons of Spanaway handed their AR-10 rifle to the groom, who posed with the rifle and their bride, then the best man held the firearm and mugged with the couple. The bride and groom, who were to be married later in Tacoma, wouldn't give their full names.
"We've all just broken the law," Lyons said after they took pictures with the rifle.
However, Washington State Patrol Trooper Guy Gill said "we're not convinced that handing someone a gun is a violation of 594."
The law, which took effect Dec. 4, requires background checks on all sales and transfers, including private transactions and many loans and gifts.
Opponents have taken most issue with the language surrounding transfers. I-594 defines a transfer as the delivery of a firearm "without consideration of payment or promise of payment including, but not limited to, gifts and loans." Exceptions include emergency gun transfers concerning personal safety, gifts between family members, antiques and loans for hunting.
Capitol officials were preparing for up to 6,000 protesters, and Washington State Patrol troopers were seen on the periphery of the crowd.

Gill said there are no plans to arrest people for exchanging guns or even selling weapons, but they could forward violations they see to prosecutors.
"Our Number 1 priority is to just make this a safe environment for people to express themselves," they said. "Most of these folks are responsible gun owners. We probably will not have an issue."
Norma Johnson of Enumclaw said the law isn't going to stop crime.
"You're targeting the wrong things by going after law-abiding citizens," they said.
Washington has joined six other states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, New York and Rhode Island, plus Washington, D.C. — in requiring universal background checks for all sales and transfers of all firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
About a dozen other states have varying laws on expansion beyond what federal law requires.

Mod support is on its way to Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, according to director and producer Naoki Yoshida.
Speaking with GameSpot during GDC, Yoshida said the development team recognizes that players want mod support for the fantasy MMO. They noted that the team is looking into ways to add it into the PC version, slowly but surely.
“We're working on mod support UI integration for those who are looking into [modding],” Yoshida said. “We've heard people and their desire for mod support and we acknowledge that. We're working towards implementing it.”
Additionally, players can expect more legacy items and instances, both from previous Final Fantasy titles and other games in Square Enix's catalog. According to Yoshida, the developers enjoy bringing other elements--like Magitek armor from Final Fantasy VI, the Gold Saucer attraction from Final Fantasy VII, and card game Triple Triad from VIII--as ways to introduce early Final Fantasy games to players who may not have touched them.
“With things like Triple Triad, there was always the concept among the team that we wanted to have an interesting card game-type content in XIV,” Yoshida said. “There's one person on the development staff who really loved Final Fantasy VIII and really wanted to get Triple Triad in there, so they presented the idea to me, it evolved, and was implemented in the game. The ideas for this kind of content typically start with me, but there are certain elements where people within the team pitched their own ideas.
“Every time we try to come up with ideas to incorporate elements from the Final Fantasy franchise and how to implement it in XIV, it's not just about literally bringing the element in but making sure it's enjoyable and integrates into the world,” they added. “The people who are familiar with the content and as well as those who haven't had a chance to play the original games must have fun with it. Seeing people who are familiar with the content talking about it, we're hoping it will get new players interested in playing previous Final Fantasy games.”
But Yoshida's team hasn't stopped with Final Fantasy games. Recently XIV added the boss EInhander, a callback to an early Squaresoft game of the same time. The MMO has also seen The Last Remnant and Dragon Quest content pop up in the past. Yoshdia said there it a lot of love within Square Enix for its own titles, so pieces of its history like Einhander will continue to be added as long as the team is passionate about creating it.
As for what Yoshida wants to add, they noted that he'd love to incorporate a lengthy dungeon in the style of another early Squaresoft title, Deep Dungeon.
“There are some titles like Final Fantasy Tactics that kind of pay homage to the Deep Dungeon stuff,” they said. “I would love to take on the challenge of incorporating elements of Deep Dungeon into FF XIV. Hypothetically, if I did, I would want it to be something where players would continue to go further and further down into the depths of a dungeon. And if you cancel out mid-dungeon or you decide to leave, you would have to start it all over again. It would be for hardcore players.
“Another element I'd want to add is from Final Fantasy IV, when they go to the moon. I'd love to do something like that,” they added.
Early last year, Final Fantasy XIV added a new event featuring Lightning, the protagonist of the Final Fantasy XIII games, to commemorate the release of Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII. Yoshida said that a similar approach could be taken with crossover content for Final Fantasy XV; what that is though is still in discussion.
“I've been talking with [XV director Hajime] Tabata about it,” they said. “We'd love to do something together.”
Yoshida is hoping to keep pushing updates to Final Fantasy XIV for the next 10 years. For him, the 10-year mark signifies a place among “legendary” MMOs like World of Warcraft and Everquest. One decade of services means you have a strong player base and the funds to keep creating a world that your audience loves.
Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn will get its first expansion, Heavensward, on June 23. But according to Yoshida, even with Heavensward on the horizon, the team is already hard at work on the second expansion.
Kevin Durant is now in need of a Bay Area home after signing with the Golden State Warriors. But six Warriors players had to change their addresses in the process, too — a fact somewhat lost in the biggest NBA news of the summer. And that includes Harrison Barnes, whom Durant is replacing in Golden State's starting lineup.
Durant's first game as a member of the Warriors at Oracle Arena in Oakland, California, will take place Tuesday in USA Basketball's exhibition against China. Meanwhile, Barnes will awkwardly return as a Team USA member after saying goodbye to their former Warriors teammates.
“Right after the KD decision happened, I texted everyone individually something special to them whatever it was, whatever my relationship was with them,” Barnes recently told The Undefeated. “I didn't want to do the cliché, ‘I'm out, guys.' I wanted to text each person individually and tell them that we are family and how much they meant to me.”
‘Strength In Numbers' convinced Kevin Durant to join Warriors
Durant's commitment to sign a two-year, $54.3 million contract on July 4 with the Warriors sparked an exodus of key players to other Western Conference teams. Starting center Andrew Bogut was traded to the Dallas Mavericks. Backup center Festus Ezeli signed with the Portland Trail Blazers. Reserve forward Marreese Speights signed with the Los Angeles Clippers. Reserve guard Brandon Rush signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Reserve guard Leandro Barbosa signed with the Phoenix Suns.
“The decision was more so made for me,” Barnes said. “I was not necessarily walking away from the situation. I wasn't saying, ‘I don't want to be here. I want to go there.' But at the same time, I'm very excited about Dallas. It gives me an opportunity to grow.”
Durant said they decided to sign with the Warriors after waking up on the morning of July 4. Barnes, however, got the impression Durant was leaning toward the team beforehand. During USA Basketball training camp last week, Durant said they had not talked to Barnes about their free agency decision and how it affected the latter.
“You started to kind of hear rumblings,” Barnes said. “Guys were starting to feel like they were probably going to come that way. It wasn't a surprise they were coming based on talking to the guys. It wasn't like, ‘Boom, boom' [after Durant's decision].
“That's where the story gets a little more confusing. It's more so when that decision was made I texted my teammates and took some time to process it. I got on the phone with my agent and looked at Dallas a lot closer and then I made the decision.”
Barnes, who struggled this past postseason averaging 9.0 points and shooting 38.5 percent from the field, actually turned down a four-year, $64 million contract extension from the Warriors in the 2015 offseason. They received a lot of skepticism for turning it down and also firing their agent at the time.
But Barnes' gamble on themselves actually paid off in the end, and more than just the extra $30 million over four years. Had the 6-foot-8, 210-pounder signed the offered contract extension by Golden State, they could have been traded like Bogut this offseason to make roster and financial room for Durant. As a free agent, Harrison chose their destination in Dallas.
“One of the biggest things that I've learned since I've been in the league is to trust the process,” Barnes said. “If you believe in something and put in the work, things will happen whether it looks that way or not. You have to finish up the process. I was confident that if I was able to do what I needed to do with the team I was on last year that it will all work out, and it did.
“I wasn't nervous just because I was betting on myself. I've gotten this far believing in myself and hopefully this will work out. I was just doing it one more time.”
Team USA guard Klay Thompson expects Barnes and their other ex-Warriors teammates to be fondly remembered for their roles in winning an NBA title in 2015. Golden State also made a second-straight Finals appearance last season after winning an NBA-record 73 games during the regular season before losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Finals. The memorable and successful Warriors team from the past two seasons was very close and on the same page on the floor.
“It's part of the biz. It's unfortunate,” Thompson said. “We will miss those guys dearly. There wasn't one bad guy on the team. We had so many good times together the last couple of years. We will cherish that for a lifetime.
“I still will hit them up every offseason. I hope ‘Dub Nation' will give them a big send-off and a big ‘standing O' every time they see them because those guys sacrificed a lot to win and did everything they could for this organization.”
Barnes will have the first opportunity out of the now ex-Warriors to get a standing ovation on Tuesday.
The last time Barnes and Durant played at Oracle Arena together was when the Warriors eliminated the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals after blowing a 3-1 series lead. But if you're looking for emotion from Barnes, wait until the NBA regular season.
“It won't be emotional,” Barnes said. “I had a great experience at Golden State. They were a first-class organization. The fans there were great. It won't be anything bitterness or anything like that. In the regular season, it will be a different feeling than now. It's still fresh.
“I'm going there with the USA. It's not like I'm going there with the Dallas Mavericks.”
But expect the pain from losing the 2016 NBA Finals and everything that went wrong to stay fresh with Barnes perhaps the rest of their life.
After Golden State took a 3-1 series lead, Draymond Green was suspended for a Game 5 Finals loss and Cleveland won the last three games. Two-time NBA MVP Stephen Curry was injury-riddled during the postseason. Bogut missed the last two Finals games to injury. Barnes combined for 15 total points in the last three Finals games, including a scoreless outing in Game 6. The Warriors' crowd was tough on Barnes in the Finals as fans moaned and groaned with every miss.
“For a number of reasons, I will never forget losing that Finals. Obviously, for a championship sake. We won so many games and we come up short,” Barnes said. “The fact that I didn't hit shots. Even if I was playing well at that time, we lost. The Finals aren't guaranteed every single year and that's what you have to look at.
“When you get to the Finals, ultimately your season is judged on what you do at the end. Those last two games, obviously, I didn't shoot it well. That's part of the criticism. If we win that game, then the storyline is completely different. It's about how you battled through adversity and won. But we didn't. That's kind of the cross you have to bear and move on.”
Along with missing their Warriors teammates, Barnes said they are also going to “miss Oakland a lot.”
One warrior executive suggested Barnes move to San Francisco upon their arrival in 2012, since the team is planning to eventually move there, and people question the safety of Oakland life. Barnes, however, lived in downtown Oakland during their entire Warriors tenure, loved the city's diversity and fondly recalls the 2015 NBA championship parade there. They supported Trail Blazers All-Star guard and Oakland native Damian Lillard by attending their third annual picnic in East Oakland last offseason. It wouldn't be surprising if Barnes eventually bought an offseason home in Oakland, too.
“Oakland was unbelievable,” Barnes said. “When I first got drafted there, there was such a reputation about what Oakland was like. Myself actually living there for four years, living downtown, I was able to get a great appreciation for the community and the people that are there. It made me realize that you can't just take what people say at face value.
“People were trying to say that it is a community that is run down, that you shouldn't live there, you should live in San Francisco. People there were always consistent with me. They always showed me love. It really does have a lot of culture. It's changing so much even the four years I was there.”
Barnes also made their presence known in Silicon Valley shortly after they first arrived from the University of North Carolina in 2012. They initiated and actually landed visits with the chief executive officers of Twitter and Yahoo before their rookie year and took tours of their facilities. The 24-year-old is also an investor and spokesperson for Palo Alto, California-based Walker & Company Brands along with USA Basketball teammate Carmelo Anthony and ex-Warriors teammate Andre Iguodala.
Tristan Walker, founder and chief executive officer of Walker & Company Brands, expressed great respect for Barnes.
“Harrison Barnes is one of the smartest young athletes I've ever met,” Walker told The Undefeated. “Always thinking for the long term. We're lucky to have them as an investor and friend.”
Barnes is expected to go from living in downtown Oakland to downtown Dallas soon. They also sound like they have moved on mentally to a new beginning with the Mavs while Durant has moved on to the Warriors.
“They have a championship coach, a stable management situation and one that is comfortable spending what it needs to be on the team,” Barnes said. “Look at the group of guys. You have Dirk [Nowitzki], who is going to be a Hall of Famer. You got guys like Wesley Matthews, who I am going to be playing alongside for a long time. We got guys like D-Will [Deron Williams]. Obviously, we got Bogut and that adds a lot, too.”
Ai's introductory dialogue is out! My confidence in this translation is lower than for the others (casual speech is hard)… Sorry if the wording is weird. Let me know if you find errors!
This is an SIF-style dialogue, so Ai is addressing the reader, a fellow student, before they shoot their introductory video (what we get as text in the member profiles).
Profile
A second-year student at Nijigasaki High School. As a suggestible person who's always willing to help, they have a lot of friends.
Them style is flashy, but they have a big heart, and she's a granny's girl. Them favorite food is nukazuke [TL note: a kind of Japanese pickle].
Dialogue right before the video
Hey, were you waiting? Oh, that's a camera!
Whoa, you borrowed it for today's filming. I definitely thought you'd be using a smartphone instead. Because using a smartphone would be smart! Ahahah! “Smartphone” and “smart”! That's a knee-slapper!
Wait, why the face? Wasn't that hilarious? You got the joke about “smartphone” and “smart”, right?
Gah! Why do you look like you saw something bizarre? What's up with you? Even though I'm an energetic girl!
What's my favorite food? I guess I'd say nukazuke. [TL note: Again, nukazuke are a kind of Japanese pickle. And yeah, I'm not sure why they changed the topic so suddenly, either.]
My grandma's nukazuke was really delicious… To think that I can't eat it any more… oh, she's not dead! She's still alive and kicking!
Eh? I've done enough of telling jokes and explaining them, so it's time to sober up? OK, got it. I'll be serious. You went to the trouble of borrowing the camera, after all.
What!? You bought the camera yourself!? You worked at a part-time job!? Wow, you're really committed. That's kind of incredible.
Ah, sorry, sorry. I wasn't trying to make fun of you. More like, “wow, they're really giving it their all”, or “I'm kinda jealous”.
There isn't anything in my life that I'm as dedicated to, you see.
Huh? So the world of school idols will have things I've never seen before. And I'll be able to see a deeply touching landscape?
Is that so? This is coming from you, and you're really serious about this, so I guess it has to be true.
Ahahah, I'm down for that! I'm getting super excited! A landscape I haven't seen before, huh… what could it be like?
Not just that, but if I do something like becoming a top school idol, grandma's definitely going to be pleased, right? “Ai's giving it them best!”
All right, I'm suddenly pumped up. Hurry up and start recording—I'll be in a great mood for this intro video!
Remarks in the video
[Pasted from my translation of the member profiles.]
Yo. I'm Ai Miyashita. I stumbled into being a school idol because my friend from school asked me if I wanted to! Everyone, I'll be in your care! I love you! Because I'm Ai! [TL note: the pun here is that “aishiteru” can mean “I love you” or “I'm being Ai”.]
With that, Ai-san's special rapid-fire pun corner starts no— oh, I can't?
……Ah, OK, sorry. I'll be serious from here on. Seriously.
Well, as you can see, I end up getting dragged into a lot of things, but I'm an honor student. You can't see that? Wait wait wait, but it's true! I'm good at both studying and athletics, and I'm stylish… you see?
Anyway, the friend I mentioned before said to me, “I think the impression of the school idol world that you have is totally off. Sure you don't wanna give it a shot?” That got me excited! I'm really prone to getting fired up from that kind of challenge.
So! I decided that I'll aim to be number one in the world of school idols!
I want to see this world that I haven't seen!
And I want to show everyone that landscape!
Let's soldier on in high spirits!

This is probably not what most people have in mind when they think of a “sunroof.”
Panasonic has developed a full-length solar roof for the Japanese version of the Toyota Prius Prime plug-in hybrid. While solar roofs have been tried on production cars before, Panasonic claims this new version can generate more power than before, and is easier to fit to a car's curved roof. But will that be enough to take solar roofs mainstream?
Since a car's roof is (relatively) flat and almost constantly exposed to sunlight, the theory goes that covering it in solar cells will allow for the harvesting of electricity. Toyota actually tried this on the old Prius Plug-In Hybrid, using solar power for accessories. Panasonic claims the new Prius Prime solar roof can provide enough power to not only run accessories, but also help charge the car's lithium-ion battery pack.
Toyota claims the solar roof can add up to 3.7 miles of electric-driving range per day while parked, and can continue to feed electricity to the battery pack while the car is in motion. Panasonic also claims the new solar roof more precisely follows the curves of the Prius Prime roof, thanks to a new laminating process for the glass that allows it to attain a three-dimensional shape.
The Prius Prime solar roof is only available in Japan at the moment, and it's unclear whether Toyota will bring it to the U.S. Panasonic is also the sole battery supplier to Tesla, and a partner in the automaker's massive “Gigafactory” in Nevada. That's led to speculation that Panasonic could adapt its solar-roof design to a future Tesla electric car, although neither company has discussed any concrete plans for that.
Looking beyond Tesla and Toyota, Karma Automotive will offer a solar roof on the Revero, the luxury car formerly known as the Fisker Karma. But while solar roofs may seem like a neat idea, it's worth noting that their added weight and cost may not be worth the relatively small amount of electricity they are able to generate in real-world use.
Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.
In calling for jihad against America, the West and Israel in terms virtually identical with Osama bin Laden's rhetoric, the leader of Egypt's powerful Muslim Brotherhood uttered one sentence that explains the contemporary Middle East.
Here it is: “The improvement and change that the [Muslim] nation seeks can only be attained through jihad and sacrifice and by raising a jihadi generation that pursues death just as its enemies pursue life.”
The writer is director of the Global Research in International Affairs Center and editor of Middle East Review of International Affairs and Turkish Studies. They blog at www.rubinreports.blogspot.com.
Here's why that sentence is so important. The central question for the Middle East for many decades has been this: Why is it – especially since we are a superior people (Arabs) with a superior religion (Islam) – that we are behind the West? How that question has been answered has been the core of Middle Eastern politics. Let's call it The Question.FROM ROUGHLY around the 1880s into the 1930s, and even until the 1950s, the main answer might be called the liberal developmentalist perspective. The West's advances were seen as being technological, institutional and intellectual. Distinguished historian Albert Hourani called this “the liberal age.”What was needed, said the leaders, in answering The Question, was to adapt and adopt Western techniques. If, for example, the Ottoman Empire or Egypt had a constitution and a multi-party parliamentary system, built up educational institutions and created private enterprises, they too would flourish.These reformers, of course, made it sound too easy. Some were secular-oriented, others thought Islam could be modernized. Ironically, the latter – like Muhammad Abdu and Rashid Rida – are often seen in retrospect as pioneers of radical Islamism, even though they were the opposite.For many reasons, the liberal age failed. One chief factor was that the Arab societies were not ready for such changes, and they could not easily be imposed from above. Another was the fact that authoritarian systems – like fascism in the 1920-1940 period and communism in the 1950-2000 era – seemed more successful than moderate democracy.Rampant corruption and extremes of class injustice were prominent, as was imperial intervention (most notably in Egypt). To some extent, the failure to prevent Israel's creation in 1948 made the existing system seem incompetent, though I'd argue the fault was more due to the radical nationalists and Islamists than to the liberals. (I deal with this issue in my book, The Arab States and the Palestine Conflict.) Yet fail the liberal age did, and in came radical Arab nationalism, gaining power beginning with the Egyptian officers' 1952 coup.Ever since, radical nationalists have dominated Arabic-speaking countries. Their answer to the key question is: The reason we are behind is not mainly due to any internal failing but to the oppression of imperialism and Zionism. The solution is to have nationalist governments with dictatorial control and state domination of the economy.These regimes will fight, defeat the West, destroy Israel, bring Arab unity, rapid development and prosperity.These regimes failed to deliver on any of their promises. They led their peoples into losing wars and generally (except for oil and gas riches) stagnant economies. These nationalist governments were generally repressive and corrupt, too, and there was much discontent. The collapse of the Soviet bloc – their main ally and model – also discredited them.One reason for this failure is a flaw in their formulation of The Question, an error they share with the Islamists. Once you blame external forces and deny the need for internal reform (such as less statist control, democracy, changes in the status of women, modernizing Islam, getting along with the West, and making peace with Israel), you ensure that you will remain backward.AND SO here we are in the early 21st century with the Arab nationalist regimes being challenged by revolutionary Islamists. Though the Islamists go back as modern political organizations to the mid-1920s, they really revived in the 1980s. The Iranian revolution and the jihadist war in Afghanistan were important factors, but so was the increasingly obvious failure of the nationalist regimes.Small new liberal movements have also arisen, somewhat parallel to those of the past but putting more stress on human rights and democracy than on technology and formal institutions. Yet they are very weak. The nationalists, the existing regimes, are far more powerful than they are; so are the Islamists.At least, though, the nationalists and their regimes are worn down by a half-century of experience and failure. So how do Islamists deal with The Question? By saying: The reason we are behind is not mainly due to any internal failing but to the oppression of imperialism and Zionism, the treason of our governments and above all our abandonment of Islam. The solution is to have proper Islamic governments with dictatorial control, state domination of the economy, unity through a new caliphate, the systematic rejection of Western culture and making our society conform to Islamic law as we interpret it. These regimes will fight, defeat the West, destroy Israel, bring Muslim unity and fulfill Allah's commands.Here's where Badi's statement fits in as the proposed solution: “The improvement and change that the [Muslim] nation seeks can only be attained through jihad and sacrifice and by raising a jihadi generation that pursues death just as its enemies pursue life.”Not through solving problems by compromise, not by ending foreign conflicts, not by better educational systems that are open to science and other imported ideas, not by modernizing Islam, not by granting equality to women, not by democracy, not by human rights. No and no and no. But only by: “...jihad and sacrifice and by raising a jihadi generation that pursues death just as its enemies pursue life.”Jihad they want and jihad they will get; death they want and death they will get; a generation of warfare they want and a generation of warfare they will get. They will fail and their claims will be seen to be hollow. Unfortunately, it will take about 50 years for that to happen. The result? Arab and Muslim-majority countries will be left even further behind the rest of the world.

A few days ago Skype users noticed that the instant messaging service served a malicious malware masquerading as fake Flash player update. Several users reported this incident on Twitter and Reddit and explained that they noticed an ad which was prompting them to download a malicious file disguised as “Flash player.”
Wow not bad, got this in @Skype today, even had the download popup! pic.twitter.com/wyQXavBINm — caseyfoster (@caseyfosterTV) March 30, 2017
On close inspection of the file, Bleeping Computers discovered that the content of the file was nothing more than a handful of malicious javascript code. The so-called “flash player update” was an HTA file (HTML application file) and was designed to execute a PowerShell script to download a payload. The payload could be a JSE (encrypted JavaScript), but because the domain on which the scam was being hosted was down, a copy of the final payload could not be retrieved. The file was probably going to install a Trojan or ransomware on victims devices.
The domains were spreading the malicious “flash player” virus are oyomakaomojiya[.]org and cievubeataporn[.]net, and according to bleeping computers, both are registered with Cock.li email accounts. They further added that the email accounts were used to register plenty of other shady domains were also registered using the same email accounts and obviously with malicious intent.
The IP addresses that are hosting the sites were previously under the radar for similar kind of shady domains, and with some more digging, Bleeping Computers discovered another email account was also being used for the same purpose.
This only concludes one thing: the domains were registered specifically for malvertising and that a group of skilled crooks is behind this massive operation.
One important thing worth mentioning here is that the user who identified the “Fake flash player” had contacted Skype support to inform them about the incident, and the Skype support refused to take the responsibility for this matter. Also, this is not the first time this kind of thing has happened. Malvertising has been increasing rapidly. In 2016 alone, malvertising saw an increase of 132%, and it is expected that the rate will go only upwards if proper measures are not taken very soon.

Thomas J. "Tom" Barrack Jr. (born April 28, 1947) is an American private equity real estate investor and the founder and executive chairperson [1][2] of Colony Capital Inc.[3][4][5][6] Barrack is a close friend and ally of President Donald Trump and has represented Trump on television news segments. They also served as the chairperson of the Presidential Inaugural Committee and was senior adviser to Trump's presidential campaign.[14][15]
Early life [ edit ]
Barrack's grandparents were Lebanese Christians who immigrated in 1900 to the United States from Zahlé, Lebanon.[16][17] Barrack was raised in Culver City, California, where their father was a grocer and their mother was a secretary.[18]
Education [ edit ]
In 1969, Barrack graduated with a BA degree from the University of Southern California, where they participated on their varsity rugby team.[19][20] Barrack then attended the USC Gould School of Law, where they were an editor of the Southern California Law Review, before receiving their JD from the University of San Diego School of Law in 1972.[19][17][21]
Career [ edit ]
Their first job was at the law firm of Herbert W. Kalmbach, President Richard Nixon's personal lawyer.[10] In 1972 the firm sent them to Saudi Arabia, where they soon became the squash partner of a Saudi prince.[16][18] They then worked in the kingdom for the Fluor Corporation,[10] and worked for Saudi princes. Shortly after, they helped open diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Haiti, then ruled by Jean-Claude Duvalier, at the request of investor Lonnie Dunn.[10]
In 1982, Barrack served as Deputy Undersecretary of the United States Department of the Interior under James G. Watt in the Reagan administration.[16][9][12] The Secret Service would board its horses at Barrack's ranch when President Reagan was at their nearby Rancho del Cielo.[16] Secretary Watt made their resignation announcement at Barrack's ranch.[16] Barrack says they became disillusioned with government service after they were required to testify before a congressional committee due to a gift Barrack had paid to the purchaser of Edwin Meese's house.[16]
In 1987, Barrack was later a principal with the Robert M. Bass Group.[16][9][11][12] In 1985, Barrack first dealt with Donald Trump when they sold Trump a one-fifth stake in the Alexander's department stores.[18] In 1988, Trump agreed to pay Barrack $410 million for total ownership of the Plaza Hotel.[18] They later lost both properties in bankruptcy.[18]
In 1990, Barrack founded Colony Capital, with initial investments by Bass and GE Capital, and later Eli Broad, Merrill Lynch, and Koo Chen-fu.[10] Barrack achieved 50% profits in their first two years by focusing on distressed properties, including the federal Resolution Trust Corporation.[16] They have invested some $200 million in the Middle East real estate, $534 million in non-performing German real estate loans, and made a $24 million loan to photographer Annie Leibovitz.[17] They also own the Neverland Ranch.[17] Through Colony Capital, they run a $25 billion portfolio of assets, from the Fairmont Raffles Hotels International hotel chain in Asia, the Aga Khan's former resort in Sardinia, Resorts International Holdings, One&Only Resorts, Atlantis, etc.[10]
Colony Starwood Homes was criticised for treating tenants poorly during the Great Recession, raising rents, evicting people in large numbers and failing to maintain properties.[22]
Barrack has previously negotiated drilling rights with Mana Al Otaiba.[18] In 2009, Barrack negotiated with their son, Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba, the sale of a $41 million stake in the Raffles L'Ermitage hotel to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.[18]
In 2010, Barrack bought $70 million of Jared Kushner's debt on 666 Fifth Avenue.[18] Kushner later avoided bankruptcy when Barrack agreed to reduce their obligations after a request by Trump.[18]
As of September 2011, Barrack was the 833rd richest person in the world, and the 375th richest in the United States, with an estimated wealth of US$1.1. a billion.[17] However, they were no longer a billionaire in 2014.[23]
In 2012, Barrack sold the Paris Saint-Germain F.C. to the Qatar Investment Authority.[18][24] Barrack had to pay €22 million to settle tax charges related to the 2012 sale of their resort on Costa Smeralda to the Qatari sovereign wealth fund.
In 2010, Barrack partnered with the Qatar Investment authority to purchase Weinstein film production company Miramax for $660 million.[16] In 2016, Barrack sold Miramax to the Qatari beIN Media Group at a fourfold profit.[18] In October 2017, Barrack's Colony Capital agreed to invest in The Weinstein Company to keep it afloat in light of the Harvey Weinstein sexual misconduct allegations.[25] The New York Times reported that the preliminary agreement with Weinstein fell apart and the acquisition broke down.[26] Colony Capital later withdrew from the deal after being unable to structure the purchase in a way to avoid enriching Harvey Weinstein.[27]
In 2017, Barrack sold a $70 million stake in One California Plaza to the Abu Dhabi crown prince's investment fund.[18] During the first eighteen months of the Trump Administration, Colony NorthStar raised 24% of its $7 billion in investment from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) or Saudi Arabia.[18]
Barrack used Cayman Islands entities to invest pension fund money in distressed real estate and send money towards the Colony parent company, according to an organization chart that surfaced in the Paradise Papers documents leaked from the Appleby law firm[28]
Barrack is a trustee at the University of Southern California and a member of the University Board of Pepperdine University.[29] They have also served on the board of directors of Accor, Kerner, First Republic Bank, Continental Airlines, Korea First Bank, and Megaworld Properties & Holdings.[12][30][31] French president Nicolas Sarkozy awarded them France's Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur.[9]
Political activity [ edit ]
Barrack endorsed Donald Trump during the United States presidential election, 2016.[32] They were a major fundraiser for Trump's campaign through the "Rebuilding America Now" Super PAC, which raised $23 million.[16][33][34]
Barrack recommended that Trump hire Paul Manafort as their campaign manager, whom Barrack had first met in the 1970s when they were both working for Saudis and living in Beirut.[18] Barrack had later loaned Manafort $1.5 million to refinance a home in the Hamptons.[16] On April 26, 2016, Barrack began an email correspondence with one of their business partners, UAE Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba, reassuring them that Trump had investments in the UAE. “The emails were the beginning of Mr. Trump's improbable transformation from a candidate who campaigned against Muslims to a president celebrated in the royal courts of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi,” according to New York Times writer David D. Kirkpatrick. This is a testament to Barrack's “unique place in the Trump world,” writes Kirkpatrick. [18] On May 26, Barrack wrote introducing Otaiba to Jared Kushner, and the two met later that month.[18] On July 13, Barrack conveyed to Otaiba that Trump had removed from the Republican Party platform the plank calling for the release of the 28 pages of redacted information from the 9/11 report.[18] On July 21, Barrack spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention.[35] In September 2016, Barrack helped set up a meeting between Trump and the Emir of Qatar in Trump Tower.[18]
Barrack served as chairperson of the committee overseeing the inauguration of Donald Trump, for which they raised over $100 million, doubling the previous record.[16] Barrack hired Rick Gates to help run the inauguration and then as a consultant. Gates was fired the day they were indicted.[36]
After Trump became president, Barrack acted as a middleman between them and Arab princes.[37] They deny a quote attributed to them in the 2018 book Fire and Fury that they said Trump was, "not only crazy" but "stupid".[38]
In a 2017 Washington Post article, Barrack commented on Trump's inflammatory rhetoric and proposals to ban immigrants from certain Muslim countries and put up a border wall with Mexico. "He's better than this," they said.[39]
Barrack was interviewed during the Special Counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, in particular regarding Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, Konstantin Kilimnik, Cambridge Analytica, the Trump campaign, the Trump transition team, and the financing of the Trump inauguration.[40][41]

Attorney-General Nicola Roxon at the weekend would not comment on the Slipper sexist texts because the court case is still under way. Them excuse does not wash; she's been happy to talk about other aspects of the case.
The Slipper texts were private communications with James Ashby (who has brought the sexual harassment case), but that is not a mitigating circumstance. They have exposed the character of the man.

Lorenz Marquardt has been sailing the Baltic Sea for more than 53 years, but the 68-year-old fisherman has an "uneasy feeling" whenever they leaf Eckernförde, in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein, for the Danish island of Bornholm.
An invisible threat lies dormant beneath them as soon as they reach the rich fishing grounds around the island. To fish for cod, their cutter drags a bottom trawl through the Bornholm Basin, which is 60 to 70 meters (197 to 230 feet) deep -- in precisely the spot where tens of thousands of bombs and shells were sunk after the end of World War II.
Nautical maps identify the area above the bomb cemetery as "contaminated (munitions)" or "contaminated (gas munitions)," and warn: "Anchoring and fishing are hazardous." German and Danish Baltic Sea fishermen take the risk because they can return to port with up to 10 metric tons of cod on their best days. That translates into several thousand fish, weighing one to 10 kilograms apiece (two to 22 lbs.), and a very good catch can fetch 6,000 to 10,000 ($7,800 to $13,000), depending on the market price.
Years ago, Marquardt pulled a 500-kilo bomb onto their cutter, together with the floundering cod. They were lucky, because the bomb wasn't porous yet. Bomb disposal experts destroyed the bomb on land, in Eckernförde.
But since World War II, hundreds of Danish fishermen have been injured after pulling rusted shells containing mustard gas, which damages the skin, on board in their nets. The gelatinous material leaked from the metal shell casings, causing severe burns.
Almost seven decades after the end of the war, residual explosives that were hardly taken seriously for a long time are now coming to light in the North and Baltic Seas. Experts estimate that there are 1.6 million metric tons of conventional and chemical ammunition in German territorial waters alone, unexploded time bombs lying in or on the sea floor. The unexploded ordnance (UXO) includes giant aerial bombs weighing hundreds of kilograms, 15-kilo shells, small high-explosive shells, hand grenades, detonators and ammunition rounds, for a total of more than 50 million individual items.
No one knows how great the danger really is. "We are familiar with only a small portion of the areas contaminated with weapons," says Jens Sternheim, chairperson of the "Munitions in the Sea" task force of the North and Baltic Sea Federal and State Committee. According to Sternheim, "munitions problems will increasingly come to light" during the construction of offshore projects, such as wind farms.
Hidden Dangers
The problem was created both during and after the war. When the Allies disarmed the Germans after defeating them, they ordered that the weapons be disposed of at sea. Before that, the Nazis had occasionally sunk their own ammunition when, for example, they feared airstrikes against their poison gas storage sites.
There are more than 100 of these bomb and shell graveyards scattered along all of northern Germany's coastlines. There are also apparently 5,000 metric tons of shells filled with substances such as phosgene and the nerve agent tabun in the Little Belt, the strait between the Danish island of Funen and the Jutland Peninsula. A report that Munitions in the Sea released a year and a half ago and is now updated lists many well known beach resorts along German coasts.
If the UXO is washed onto land, is caught in fishing nets or is merely disturbed during preparatory work for pipelines and offshore wind farms, it can pose a danger to local residents, vacationers, fishermen and excavator operators.
Last year, munitions clearing crews working in the Ems River estuary found two sea mines, massive metal spheres containing up to 300 kilos of explosives, which were intended to sink enemy ships headed for Nazi Germany. The mines were detonated. In July 2012, a tourist on the North Sea island of Wangerooge found the warhead of a German torpedo, which was also subsequently destroyed in a controlled detonation. Anyone walking in the tidal flats of the Elbe River estuary near the port of Cuxhaven should be alert. According to the expert report, "the munitions components, some of them lying openly exposed in the tidal flats, are dangerous."
Explosions can happen almost anywhere. During construction work on the Riffgat offshore wind farm, about 15 kilometers (9 miles) northwest of the East Frisian island of Borkum, 2.7 metric tons of munitions were discovered and salvaged, and there are unexploded cluster bombs in the tidal flats south of Norderney, another East Frisian island. Walkers in the tidal flats near Kampen, a municipality on the North Sea resort island of Sylt, discovered two bombs in December 2012. The bomb disposal service assessed the find and detonated the two bombs after deeming them dangerous.
Beachgoers usually have no idea what can be washed up at their feet. In July 2012, two children from the southwestern state of Baden-Württemberg who were playing on the beach in Kalifornien, a town near the northern city of Kiel, brought a 1.5-kilo lump of material back to their parents' vacation house. Suddenly the hands, T-shirt, jacket and pants of one of the boys turned a yellowish orange. The lump consisted of Schiesswolle 39, an explosive compound that the German navy used in WWII torpedoes and can cause skin irritation. The boy was not injured.
Dangerous UXO also lies under important shipping routes. When a munitions clearing crew began working off the Baltic Sea resort town of Travemünde in 2011, it discovered, at a depth of 20 meters, six warheads from V1 flying bombs in or near the channel used by the large ferries that depart from Travemünde for Scandinavia or the Baltic countries. There is also UXO in the Flensburg Fjord, in Eckernförde and Hohwacht Bays and, farther to the east, in the northeastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, in the Bay of Greifswald and off the islands of Rügen and Usedom (see graphic).
Fear of Disasters
For decades, Germany's states paid almost no attention to the dangerous legacy from World War II. In the end, it was not even a German government agency, but Stefan Nehring, a marine biologist and environmental consultant from the western city of Koblenz, who discovered one of the worst munitions graveyards in 2008. They had spent several years digging through mountains of records in the Federal Archives in Koblenz and the affiliated military archive in the southwestern city of Freiburg. While doing research in London, they uncovered concrete evidence of an especially heinous environmental crime: In September 1949, the British military administration had ordered the Germans to drop about 6,000 field artillery shells into the North Sea four kilometers south of the Helgoland archipelago. The shells were filled with 11.7 metric tons of the nerve agent tabun.
"Until then, German authorities had been unaware of the reports from the British National Archives cited by Dr. Nehring," the Schleswig-Holstein state government noted. The toxic waste disposal site was even a target area for the German military's torpedo attack exercises in 2010. Ships bound for the Port of Helgoland also sail near the area.
The shells will probably remain on the sea floor until they disintegrate completely, at least according to a recommendation from Germany's Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency and the international Helsinki Commission, which is responsible for environmental protection in the Baltic Sea. The recommendation states that there is no concrete threat to shipping owing to water depths of about 50 meters, and that possible environmental damage is limited to the immediate vicinity.
Nehring disagrees: "We're not talking about peanuts here, but a cocktail of chemicals in our waters." They want to see a ban on fishing imposed off the Helgoland coast. They argue that even the interior ministry in Kiel, the state capital of Schleswig-Holstein, acknowledged four years ago that the sunken tabun shells are "highly dangerous objects, especially for fisheries, work on the sea floor (anchor maneuvers) and salvage operations."
The authorities are even more concerned about the effects of UXO on land. Some beach resorts do a lot to minimize the risks for vacationers. From before the beginning of Easter vacation to the end of the fall vacation period, employees with the private ordnance-disposal firm KMB Kampfmittelbergung travel to Wangerooge every two weeks to walk with bomb-detection equipment along the eastern beaches between Breakwater B and Breakwater T, a roughly 3.7-kilometer route on which UXO has been discovered for decades.
Last year alone, the KMB team found about 90 high-explosive shells, most of them small, 16 detonators, a torpedo head, a mine and various components of small munitions.
Danger to Vacationers and Beachcombers
Some of the most beautiful spots on the Baltic Sea coast are also burdened by this sinister war legacy. Usedom, Germany's second-largest island after Rügen, could be a truly idyllic seaside location if it weren't for the phosphorus accidents, the delayed consequence of a British air raid. In 1943, the British discovered that the Nazis were building a rocket in Peenemünde, a port village on Usedom. The V2 was being developed there under the direction of engineer and rocket scientist Wernher von Braun.
On the night of Aug. 17, 1943, 596 Royal Air Force bombers dropped tens of thousands of bombs onto the test facility within a few hours. About 40 percent, including incendiary bombs filled with phosphorus, accidentally landed in the sea east of Peenemünde.
Whether it happened in 1943, when the bombs burst upon contact, or in the ensuing decades as a result of corrosion, a large amount of white phosphorus leaked out of the metal casings. It became deposited on the sea floor and, especially during storm surges, makes its way onto land. It can become calamitous for the dozens of amber collectors who walk between Peenemünde and Zinnowitz on weekends, because even experts cannot distinguish the phosphorus lumps from amber at first glance.
Accidents happen every so often. Tourists carelessly put lumps they believe are amber into their pockets. If pieces of phosphorus are heated to temperatures of between 20 and 30 degrees Celsius (68 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit), they can spontaneously ignite, emitting a darting flame with temperatures that can reach 1,300 degrees Celsius. Phosphorus is highly toxic, and merely touching it can cause organ damage.
The administrator of the Usedom North region, Kerstin Teske, tries to reassure visitors, saying that the overall risk from phosphorus is low. They note that there are one or two incidents a year, and that a total of 12 have been reported since 1990. Teske says that they also like to go amber-hunting on the beaches.
Marine biologist Nehring, on the other hand, recommends imposing a ban on gathering amber as long it remains unclear how much more phosphorus will wash ashore. The interior ministry in Schwerin, the capital of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, feels that a ban is not feasible because it would be difficult to monitor compliance. "How are you supposed to distinguish between an illegal amber-collector and a legal shell or rock collector?" asks one official.
One approach is to provide amber-gatherers with metal containers at lifeguard stations. The containers reduce the risks of phosphorus exposure. But since local residents and tourists alike rarely use the containers, accidents are likely to continue in the future, such as one that occurred on the Baltic Sea coast a year ago. Two female tourists from the eastern states of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt became the victims of a phosphorus flame, suffering second- and third-degree burns.
Collin Sexton didn't play during Alabama's exhibition game Monday night and it's now unclear when the five-star first-year student point guard will be able to suit up for the Crimson Tide.
Alabama gets good news from NCAA on Collin Sexton The NCAA made a decision regarding Collin Sexton on Thursday.
Tide officials were informed Monday afternoon that Sexton hasn't had their eligibility reinstated by the NCAA, so Sexton was held out of the exhibition game against Alabama-Huntsville Monday night and could potentially have to sit out games going forward.
"We don't have any further information at this time, but we will continue to cooperate with the NCAA and work toward a resolution that results in Collin's timely reinstatement," Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne said in a statement. "While we are disappointed, the right decision was to err on the side of caution for tonight's exhibition game."
This may stem from the FBI's college basketball investigation. Former Tide staff member Kobie Baker, who was "Staff Member 1" in the FBI complaint, received money in exchange for agreeing to push Alabama players toward signing with a certain financial advisor upon turning pro, according to the FBI complaint.
The document details a meeting Baker arranged with a player's father, that financial advisor and a man, Rashan Michel, who was arrested as part of the FBI investigation.
While the player's father wasn't named, they were identified as the father of a highly-ranked first-year student at Staff Member 1's school. In addition, the meeting took place in Sexton's hometown of Atlanta.
Alabama coach Avery Johnson said multiple times Monday night, "Hopefully we'll have a quick resolution."
"He's handled this whole process in a first-class manner," Johnson said of Sexton. "You're talking about a kid that has straight As. They get upset when they make a below 90 grade on a test. ... Obviously they were a little disappointed (about not playing Monday night), but they said, 'OK, coach. I'll go back to my dorm and get some clothes and I'll get on the bench and cheer on the guys.' And that's what type of kid they are because he's a kid of strong character."

As we reported earlier, Kellyanne Conway may have made a big mistake by appearing on television earlier Thursday morning and hawking Ivanka Trump‘s product in front of a national audience. “Go buy Ivanka's stuff,” Conway said. “I'm gonna give it a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online.” But, you see, there is a federal law that actually pretty explicitly prevents this.
The regulation, 5 CFR 2635.702, says: “An employee shall not use their public office for their own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity.”
Legal experts from across the country are weighing in saying this endorsement was a clear violation.
Don W. Fox, former general counsel of Office of Government Ethics, told The Washington Post that “This is jaw-dropping to me. This rule has been promulgated by the federal Office of Government Ethics as part of the Standards of Conduct for all executive branch employees and it applies to all members of the armed forces as well.”
So what will happen to Conway? The answer is probably not much of anything. The law is pretty vague when it comes to penalties, and ultimately leaves it up to the President to do anything to them
“The issue is whether the White House will even acknowledge that this is wrong, this shouldn't have been done,” Larry Noble from the Campaign Legal Center told LawNewz.com. “I don't expect to see (a punishment) but I can always hope.”
Typically, Noble says an employee may face a warning, suspension, or even firing for this kind of ethics violation.
“This is an unusual situation, because of who is involved in it,” Noble said. “This isn't being done inadvertently. They are doing this purposely. The way they did it was very much in your face.”
So, as far as penalties, the law states:
A violation of this part or of supplemental agency regulations may be cause for appropriate corrective or disciplinary action to be taken under applicable Governmentwide regulations or agency procedures. Such action may be in addition to any action or penalty prescribed by law.
As you can see it's pretty nonspecific. So who would even initiate the investigation against Conway? Well, according to the law, “It is the responsibility of the employing agency to initiate appropriate disciplinary or corrective action.” Since Kellyanne Conway is counsel to the President, it would be up to Trump to initiate an investigation.
However, there is a caveat.
Corrective action may ALSO be ordered or disciplinary action recommended by the Director of the Office of Government Ethics. The Director of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) is Walter M. Shaub, who has been quite critical of Trump. For example, last month, they slammed President Trump‘s conflict-of-interest plan, saying it “does not meet the standards.” It is likely that Shaub's agency will receive a complaint about Conway's comments, and may advise the White House about the law.
Next, OGE will probably generate a letter or report, and may even find that Conway violated the law. But, OGE has no enforcement or investigative authority. So ultimately the President has a lot of discretion on whether to take any action. As OGE noted in a series of tweets, other agencies do have the power to investigate:
1/OGE's website, phone system and email system are receiving an extraordinary volume of contacts from citizens about recent events. — U.S. OGE (@OfficeGovEthics) February 9, 2017
2/OGE works to prevent ethics violations. OGE does not have investigative or enforcement authority. — U.S. OGE (@OfficeGovEthics) February 9, 2017
3/Congress, GAO, the FBI, Inspectors General, and the Office of Special Counsel have the authority to conduct investigations. — U.S. OGE (@OfficeGovEthics) February 9, 2017
4/ When OGE learns of possible ethics violations, OGE contacts the agency, provides guidance & asks them to notify OGE of any action taken. — U.S. OGE (@OfficeGovEthics) February 9, 2017
5/OGE is actively following this agency-contact process. — U.S. OGE (@OfficeGovEthics) February 9, 2017
In typical cases, a multi-day suspension might be issued against the employee. But, this case is far from typical. And considering that just yesterday, President Donald Trump semi-endorsed Ivanka's products on their own Twitter account by blasting Nordstrom's for dropping their line, it is unlikely Trump would jump at an opportunity to punish Conway.
We've reached out to additional experts on this issue, and will update accordingly.
Editor's Note: This piece has been updated with tweets from the Office of Government Ethics.

New Black Panther Members Plotted to Blow Up Ferguson Police Station But Ran Out of Cash on EBT Card
Two New Black Panthers members were indicted in April on charges they were planning to bomb public buildings including the Ferguson police station.
Brandon Orlando Baldwin, 22, and Olajuwon Davis,22 were indicted on charges by federal agents.
KMOV reported:
Two St. Louis men were indicted Thursday after being arrested by federal agents in November. Brandon Orlando Baldwin, 22, and Olajuwon Davis,22 were indicted on charges involving the conspiracy to maliciously damage and destroy a building, vehicle and other property with explosives and the illegal purchase of firearms from a Cabela's store. The indictment stated that Baldwin stated that they wanted multiple bombs to use against people, buildings, vehicles and property. Davis and Baldwin allegedly viewed a recording of the detonation of an explosive or bomb shortly after Baldwin's statement. A week after viewing the recording Davis and Baldwin traveled to a location where Davis took possession of what both men thought were explosives or bombs and were arrested and have been in federal custody since.
Olajuwon Ali is the local leader of the New Black Panther Party in St. Louis. Last year they released a video inviting local blacks to join their group.
This week the Brandon Orlando Baldwin and Olajuwon Davis admitted in court that they were planning to blow up a police station and murder St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch… But they didn't have enough money on their EBT card!
Breitbart reported:
Two members of the New Black Panther Party who met in Ferguson during protests over Michael Brown's death admitted in court Tuesday they planned to blow up a police station and kill the prosecutor involved in the case. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports 23-year-old Olajuwon Ali Davis and 24-year-old Brandon Orlando Baldwin each pleaded guilty to multiple explosive and gun related charges in federal court today. Federal agents who tracked the duo's conversations by phone and text message say they planned to target Robert McCulloch, the prosecutor who handled the Michael Brown grand jury, and Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson. The plot involved blowing up cars using remotely triggered bombs and also using bombs to blow up a police station. The men were arrested last November after paying an undercover federal agent a total of $250 to purchase what they believed were three pipe bombs. Davis put up $100 and then paid another $150 three days later, when they met the agent to pick up their bombs. Baldwin said they were broke and needed to wait for their unemployment check to come in before they could contribute. In addition to buying the “bombs,” Davis and Baldwin bought guns which they intended to give to like-minded individuals in order to “be like an army.”
We're excited to be here with our first product, and we're certain that you're going to love our super sleek, low profile GoPro handle -- the GoBall.
If you're reading this, you probably love your GoPro as much as we do. You bring it everywhere and you use it to capture any and every activity. You have a plethora of mounts for every application imaginable, but none feels too comfortable in the pocket or allows for a grip that gives a steady shot. We feel that the compact design of the GoPro should be accompanied by an equally compact handle.
A Brief History
Marco and I are GoPro fanatics and we like to keep it close by -- usually in our back pocket -- so we can capture as much of life's nuances as we can. Our first version was just a cheap DSLR stabilizer handle mated with a GoPro tri-pod mount. It could fit in our pockets, worked great and provided us with months of great footage.
When the GoPro Hero3+ arrived, we knew we wanted something smaller to accompany the more compact size of the new GoPro casing. This was essentially the same handle but smaller. It totally satisfied our needs, but was lacking in aesthetic design.
That's when Marco and I came up with using a spherical handle. We were able to cut down on the overall size even more, yet we maintained a generous surface area for grip. Our first prototype was just a screw in a tri-pod mount with a ball of aluminum foil wrapped around it and then covered in duct tape. As simple as it seems, it really proved our theory to be valid - the spherical handle was the way to go.
We went through the most basic design, had it 3D printed and tested it. It performed great. The grip feels incredibly natural and allows you to pull the camera out of your pocket faster than a Formula 1 pit-stop.
As soon as our final version 3D printed prototype arrived, Marco and I knew that we were onto something and immediately thought about how this could be used by so many GoPro users around the world. We instantly thought about Kickstarter and started talking to manufacturers.
Rewards
Our goal of $5800 covers the bare minimum to produce enough GoBall handles and ship them to all the pledges. This scenario would be a short run of 270 units and we found a Minnesota manufacturer that specializes in short-run, short time-frame production. The way we have scaled this is for the first 100 backers to receive a GoBall for $19 and every backer after that will get one for $23. Both prices make this one of the most affordable GoPro accessories on the market. If we are considerably over-funded, we have plans for GoBall stickers, lanyards, etc that would be given to each backer for free. However, the goal of $5800 provides us with just enough funding to produce a short run of GoBalls.
Technical Information
We knew that high quality, a short turn-around time and good communication with the manufacturer were paramount. We had numerous discussions with multiple factories here in the USA and we refined the design of the GoBall for maximum weight savings, great looks and a design that would be compatible with super-strong ABS plastic injection molding.
At this point we have settled with two different factories for two different scenarios. The factory in Minnesota is if we just scrape by, but if the GoBall turns out to be a big hit, we have also been in contact with a large-scale manufacturer to crank out a boat-load of GoBalls at an equally fast turn-around time.
Speaking of turn-around time, the manufacturing process can take 2-4 weeks depending on the size of the order. Then comes our part -- to send each GoBall out to all of you Kickstarters. We estimate that shouldn't take more than 2 weeks. Adding a 2 week cushion brings us into May. If you've noticed, we indicated in the rewards section that delivery will be June at the latest. We are very confident that we will meet this mark with time to spare. Of course, we will be updating all of you backers of our progress all along the way.
Now that we have all our pieces in place, it's time to see if the GoBall really is what Marco and I think it is - the most usable GoPro handle on the market. Over the last week, we've had a very favorable response on our Instagram account @kickstartgoball, but it's ultimately up to you Kickstarters to see how far this handle will go and how much more footage you'll get out of life. We're excited about the ride!

On CNN Sunday evening, liberal ESPN columnist LZ Granderson justified the President's repeated lie about ObamaCare, claiming that Americans knew they did it for their own good.
"And, time and time again, Americans have said we can deal with the lies that President Obama tells us because we believe in their heart, they have the best interest for the American people," Granderson claimed. They also accused Peggy Noonan of whitewashing the "atrocities" of the Reagan administration.
"Peggy Noonan has made a living scrubbing clean President Reagan's administration and all the atrocities that it's committed," Granderson responded to Noonan's criticism of President Obama's dishonesty.
However, Granderson said the public can "live with" Obama's lie: "Every president is going to lie to you. Every politician is going to lie to you. The question is, which lies can you live with?"
Below is a transcript of the segment, which aired on CNN Newsroom on December 1 at 6:24 p.m. EST:
[6:24]
ROSA FLORES: So, L.Z., let's start with you. Let's say the reboot works. Has all the damage already been done or can the improved technology make up for that disastrous roll out that we all watched?
LZ GRANDERSON, CNN commentator: Well, it would help Americans forgive but we will never forget. Republicans certainly won't allow Americans to forget because we head into 2014 for the midterm elections. But let's get one thing clear. It's not – this is going to help some Americans. We're talking tens of millions of Americans that needed health care, not just for themselves and for their family members, but for the American economy. This rise in health care cost has drastically hurt the American economy. And we haven't spent enough time talking about that impact and the American Care Act to help address that need, as well as the individuals needing insurance.
BEN FERGUSON, CNN commentator: I agree with you on one thing. The rising costs are killing people, and for some of them, literally. The problem is, Obamacare, and the Affordable Care Act has done just that. We have seen people that their premiums skyrocketed under Obamacare. So, yeah, they can get the Web site working. Yet this morning on New Day, we saw the Web site was not working. There was an error page yet again when even we at CNN here tried to get it to work this morning on New Day and they couldn't get it to finish all the way up. So, that's your biggest issue is that.
But then you go back to the second part and that is, the Affordable Care Act is showing people prices that they don't like, that they thought were going to be cheaper. And, in fact, they are not cheaper and that's where the President I think is going to have a really big problem in the midterms as they promised affordable care and it's not affordable for a lot of Americans who are seeing sticker shock when they go online.
FLORES: So, let's talk about the trust issue here, because the Latest CNN/ORC poll revealed that a majority of Americans now say President Obama is not trustworthy. 46 percent say that they can be trusted. So, obviously, it's a problem when a majority of the Americans believe their president can't be trusted. And most people say it's a direct result of their broken pledge -- the pledge we all heard that people who like their doctor or their insurance plan can keep them. Now, here is how conservative columnist Peggy Noonan put it this morning on ABC. Take a listen.
(Video Clip)
PEGGY NOONAN, Wall Street Journal columnist: The American people look at the President and they think, he's no dummy, they are a really smart guy. And because they are a smart guy, they think – well, that means they deliberately misled us to get their program through. People don't like that. That is another reputation changer, and I think that's problematic for the President going forward.
(End Video Clip)
FLORES: So, L.Z., is Peggy Noonan right?
GRANDERSON: You know, Peggy Noonan has made a living scrubbing clean President Reagan's administration and all the atrocities that it's committed. So, with that being said, I don't think that history –
FERGUSON: What does that have to do with this?
GRANDERSON: Well, what I'm saying is, is that they are pretending as if once an error has happened, it's forever going to trail a president. And that just isn't true. And they are living proof of that with scrubbing clean President Reagan's reputation.
Now with President Obama, it is true. They should have been more forthright with how the Affordable Care Act was going to impact the country. But with that being said, all Americans know politicians lie. The question is, which lies can you live with? And, time and time again, Americans have said we can deal with the lies that President Obama tells us because we believe in their heart, they have the best interest for the American people. Every president is going to lie to you. Every politician is going to lie to you. The question is, which lies can you live with?
FERGUSON: L.Z., I think it is really sad that we're sitting here having this debate. And you're – at least you are willing to admit that the President lied to the American people. The problem is they lied to the American people –
GRANDERSON: Every president does.
FERGUSON: Let me finish, let me finish. They lied to the American people to sell them their signature plan and they lied to them about saying it was personal. This is not about "read my lips, no new taxes." This is "You can keep your doctor if you like your doctor. You can keep your plan if you like your plan." When it comes to health care, you're the ones that sold the American people on this issue of it is important, it is a trust issue, this is something that is incredibly important to seniors and we're not going to mess with the system if you like it.
GRANDERSON: Forty million people.
FERGUSON: And the president lied to people. And they are smart enough and the American people know he's smart, and they know they lied to them and I think this is one of those unforgivable lies when you tell someone they can keep their doctor and you knew you were lying to them and now they can't keep their doctor.

I would like the government to TAKE ACTION to help those, like me, suffering with the hair-loss disease Alopecia Areata by FUNDING RESEARCH to FIND A CURE.
Alopecia is an autoimmune disease- the immune system attacks hair follicles. The exact cause is unknown. Approximately 1.7% of the population are affected by Alopecia.
It affects men, women & children - about 25% of people affected have a family history of the condition.
Alopecia can destroy confidence & self-esteem and can have a detrimental effect on relationships, families and careers.
Alopecia is not taken seriously by many health professionals as it's not life-threatening. BUT it is NOT "just a hair issue". It is a HEALTH issue. I am a bald 29 year old woman. I have no eyebrows, lashes or body hair. That is not healthy.
Our bodies should have hair. Hair serves a purpose. It's not just to look pretty.
Research is needed into the cause, and hopefully cure, of Alopecia. Thanks.
Almost 8.3 million patient records have been stolen from a Virginia government website that tracks prescription drug abuse, according to hackers who are demanding a $10 million ransom for their return.
"I have your shit!" the note, which was posted to Wikileaks read. "In *my* possession, right now, are 8,257,378 patient records and a total of 35,548,087 prescriptions. Also, I made an encrypted backup and deleted the original. Unfortunately for Virginia, their backups seem to have gone missing, too."
The message said if officials didn't respond within seven days the information would be made available to whoever offered the highest bid. The story was first reported by Brian Krebs's Security Fix blog.
The claims could not immediately be verified. It stretches the imagination to believe outsiders could break into a state-run website and destroy both the original data and its backup, which presumably would be stored off-site. A spokesperson from Virginia's Department of Health Professions didn't return a phone call seeking comment. They told Security Fix the website was shut following following the April 30 discovery of an intrusion. They never directly addressed whether sensitive data was stolen or deleted.
The Virginia PMP homepage remained unreachable at time of writing, and the state has temporarily discontinued email to and from the department, Security Fix said. An FBI spokesperson in Richmond, Virginia told the Associated Press the agency was investigating a referral from the Virginia Information Technologies Agency. State police said they are assisting as well, the AP reported.
The episode is the latest cautionary tale to involve the mass storage of medical records in electronic form. When not secured properly, these are easier to steal than paper records. In November, pharmacy prescription processor Express Scripts offered a $1m bounty for information leading to the arrest of blackmailers who threatened to disclose stolen records belonging to millions of patients.
President Barack Obama has made the digitization of medical records a major pillar of their push to lower the cost of health care. Assuming the extortionists in this case aren't bluffing when they say they've acquired records belonging to almost 8.3 million people, electronic storage of such sensitive information comes with a cost that can be underestimated only at our peril. ®
This Week at War: Is This the Week Mexico Lost the Drug War?
Is this what defeat looks like?
On March 13, in two separate but seemingly coordinated attacks, gunmen in Juárez, Mexico, killed two employees of the U.S. Consulate , along with the husband of one of the employees. They were gunned down in their cars while returning from a children's party. Although in recent years U.S. citizens and government employees have died in the crossfire of Mexico's drug wars, this deliberate attack on U.S. government employees in Mexico signals a further escalation in the conflict. FBI agents investigating the murders guessed that the murders were meant to " send a message " to both the Mexican and U.S. governments.
The vast majority of the killings in Juárez and elsewhere in Mexico are the result of gangs battling for control of drug distribution markets. But the escalatioán of Mexico's violence began in December 2006 when President Felipe Calderón decided to attack the drug cartels which in their view were challenging the state's authority. The government's offensive has resulted in a complex, multisided, and violent scramble for markets, coercive power, and political influence.
What message did the gunmen intend to send with the murder of the consulate workers? It is a message easily recognized by students of irregular warfare. Insurgents competing with the government for influence over the population have pain as one of the principal tools in their toolbox. Apply the pain in a terrifying manner against even the most imposing symbols of authority — in this case the U.S. government — and political results may follow.
In Juárez, this tactic might be working. Despite Calderón's addition of 10,000 federal troops, Juárez has already suffered 500 murders in 2010. According to articles in both the New York Times and Los Angeles Times , many residents of Juárez have had enough of Calderón's war on the cartels. The president arrived for their third visit in a month, promising a list of social programs in addition to the military campaign. But, according to the Los Angeles Times, Calderón was met with nervous and angry protesters, calling for a return to the more peaceful days before they became president.
Three years into Calderón's escalation, an increasing number of Mexicans may now conclude that the only path to greater peace may be accommodation with the cartels. With their ability to apply intense pain and also distribute their massive revenues within some of Mexico's neighborhoods, the cartels are in a good position to sway public opinion toward a truce. Calderón sought to establish the state's authority as supreme. Juárez could instead show them what defeat looks like.
Reining in rogues? Or stifling initiative?
Over the past week, the news from Afghanistan brought three stories with a common theme — in each case, headquarters had to rein in rogue operators who were either exceeding their authority or were breaking the law. That's one view, but maybe not the correct one. Another perspective is less sympathetic: nervous "control freaks" at the top of the chain of command are punishing creative field officers for daring to take the initiative. If this view is more correct, it is a worrisome trend for the U.S. mission.
In the first story, the Washington Post‘s Rajiv Chandrasekaran reported the anonymous grumblings of U.S. officials in Kabul and Washington who object to aspects of Marine Corps operations in Helmand province. According to Chandrasekaran, Marine commanders are not waiting for permission from higher headquarters to expand their territory and apply their own solutions to problems in their area of responsibility. The response from U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry was to regard the Marines as a "42nd nation" in the coalition. A senior Obama administration official complained about the Marine Corps approach damaging "operational coherence."
Next was a report that Gen. Stanley McChrystal has seized direct command over all special operations forces in Afghanistan. This implies that units that worked for another command or were in direct support of local commanders no longer will be. According to the New York Times , McChrystal took this action in response to some recent direct action raids that went awry, resulting in the killing of Afghan civilians.
Finally, there is the murky case of Michael Furlong, a civilian employee of U.S. Strategic Command. Furlong stands accused of using funds within the Pentagon's anti-roadside-bomb program to establish an informal intelligence-gathering network in Afghanistan using civilian contractors. According to the Washington Post, the CIA and the special operations community complained about Furlong, whose activities are now under investigation.
Are these three cases examples of rogue operations that needed to be reined in? Or of nervous commanders and staff officers punishing subordinates for taking the initiative?
In isolation, each of these cases of greater central control may be justifiable. Freeing Kandahar from the Taliban may require more cooperation from the Marines. Special operations forces may make fewer errors if under McChrystal's command. And midlevel bureaucrats should not be able to exceed their authority and spend taxpayer money in violation of the law (if that is in fact what Furlong did).
However justifiable each of these cases may be, the resulting appearance in the field might be that initiative, creativity, and risk-taking doesn't pay — it only results in disapproving scrutiny and possible punishment. Field Manual 3-24 , the Pentagon's guide to counterinsurgency, states that "effective COIN operations are decentralized, and higher commanders owe it to their subordinates to push as many capabilities as possible down to their level. Mission command encourages the initiative of subordinates and facilitates the learning that must occur at every level." Is FM 3-24 now passé in Kabul and Washington?
McChrystal's staff (and the White House staff) does not have all the answers on how to prevail in Afghanistan. The answers are out in the field, to be discovered by the soldiers out there. That is something the top of the chain of command should ponder the next time it feels the urge to tighten its grip.
French President Emmanuel Macron accused Russian state news outlets of spreading "fake news" and "propaganda" against them during May's presidential election, after holding talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Versailles Palace outside Paris.
The meeting on May 29 was the first between the two men since Macron's decisive May 7 victory over right-wing rival Marine Le Pen, a Putin admirer whom the Kremlin and its surrogates appeared to favor, and came amid bilateral ties that remain strained.
Speaking at a joint news conference with Putin, Macron said RT and Sputnik were "organs of influence and propaganda" and "behaved like structures of the government."
Macron's team alleged that Russian hacking and disinformation efforts aimed to derail their campaign.
Putin denied that Moscow meddled in France's presidential election and said that by meeting Le Pen in Moscow in March the Kremlin had not tried to influence the vote.
Macron, 39, said the two leaders had a "frank exchange" over their "differences" on a number of issues, including the Ukraine standoff and Russia's support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's civil war.
Macron has said they support the continuation of Western sanctions targeting Russia over its 2014 seizure of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and backing of armed separatists in eastern Ukraine, whose war with Kyiv's forces has killed almost 10,000 people.
WATCH: Putin Welcomed By New French President At Versailles
They said last week that they wanted to bring together the "Normandy format," which groups the leaders of Russia, Germany, France, and Ukraine and which met first in Normandy, France.
On May 29, Macron said they and Putin agreed the time was right for a new round of peace talks on Ukraine, adding that the talks should take place "in days or weeks."
Putin, 64, said sanctions imposed by Western countries on Russia over its activities in Ukraine would not help stabilize the situation in the east of the country, where it borders Russia.
On Syria, Macron said the use of chemical weapons is a red line for France and would result in reprisals.
France and Russia back different sides in the Syrian conflict, with Putin supporting Assad and Macron part of a Western coalition that supports rebel groups and has accused Assad of using chemical weapons in the past.
Macron said they wanted Paris and Moscow to improve intelligence sharing on Syria and to cooperate on finding a political solution to the conflict, though they gave no details on what they think a deal would look like.
Putin questioned France's independence in its Syria policy because it was part of a U.S-lead alliance, adding that the two leaders had agreed the fight against terrorism was their top priority, even if their views on Syria had not changed.
"Any use of chemical weapons would result in reprisals and an immediate riposte, at least where France is concerned," Macron said.
"Our two countries will cooperate on Syria, this is essential. … We need strong cooperation because we have a joint priority, which is the fight against terrorism," they added.
Macron also said that Putin had promised "the whole truth" about an alleged campaign of abuse, including murder, targeting gay men in Chechnya, a mainly Muslim region in Russia's south ruled by Kremlin-backed strongman Ramzan Kadyrov.
"President Putin told me... they had undertaken several initiatives on the subject of LGBT people in Chechnya with measures aimed at establishing the whole truth about the activities of local authorities," Macron said, adding they would be "vigilant" on the issue.

McCabe has served for 20 years with the FBI and was appointed deputy director in 2016. They were appointed acting director of the agency after Comey was fired.
Garcia, an associate judge of the New York Court of Appeals, was nominated to that court by Gov. Andrew Cuomo in January of 2016 and confirmed a month later.
Garcia was U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 2005 to 2008, nominated by President George W. Bush. They previously served as an assistant U.S. attorney for the district, and also served as acting commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and assistant secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Fisher is a former assistant U.S. attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's criminal division and is now a partner in Latham & Watkins' Washington, D.C. office. If nominated and confirmed, they would be the first woman to lead the FBI.
Fisher was in charge of the criminal division of the Justice Department when lobbyist Jack Abramoff was prosecuted in a corruption case. When they pleaded guilty to three counts Fisher said: "Government officials and government action are not for sale."
Fisher also testified in support of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was confirmed in April to replace the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.
Often, opponents of environmental laws and regulations claim that environmentalists care about more about beauty and cute creatures than people.
A new report on the world's oceans offers us new proof that this is a false choice. The first ever report from the International Programme on the State of the Ocean (IPSO), a gathering of many of the world's top ocean scientists, warns of mass extinction of marine life as one of the results of accumulating problems in the oceans of the world.
The oceans are beautiful, awe-inspiring, and magnificent. They are also engines of economic activity, and the source of much essential human sustenance. As we harm the oceans, we harm ourselves, in potentially disastrous ways.
If we seriously damage the oceans, as humanity is on track to do, we will damage ourselves more in the process. Protecting the oceans is not just about how beautiful coral looks or about how polluted the oceans are, it is also, concurrently, about protecting the fish we eat, the air we breathe, the amount of overheating we suffer from. It is not just about pristine shorelines, it is about whether or not we will have enough food to feed our growing population, or even feed our existing population.
The threat to the world's oceans comes from a combination of factors: increasing zones of low oxygen, increasing “dead zones” of virtually no oxygen, chemical pollution from agricultural run-off, the massive accumulation of plastics particularly in the Pacific Ocean, increased acidification due to the excess carbon dioxide the ocean is absorbing due to global warming, the heating up of the oceans, habitat destruction, and serious overfishing of many forms of marine life.
The report notes that the state of the oceans are closely tracking the worst-case scenarios from the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, and that many of the problems are caused directly by human activity, and that the various problems are interacting to cumulatively create even worst effects.
The main harm to the oceans comes not from the actions of individuals acting rashly, but from major industries – the industries that overfish, that dump pollution, that profit from over-fertilization of agricultural lands, and that dump oil as BP did last year . While we as individuals can take action to help, the main solutions have to do with changing the practices of major corporations in shipping, fishing, the burning of fossil fuels for agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing. We need fundamental and worldwide solutions.

From the Other Side, February 2015
By Paul Kincaid
[Editor's Note: From the Other Side is Paul Kincaid's monthly column on books and news from the other side of the Atlantic.]
Most poignant publication of the month has to be Poems by Iain Banks and Ken MacLeod (Little Brown). The book came out on 16th February, which would have been Banks's 61st birthday, and also, incidentally, the 31st anniversary of the publication of The Wasp Factory. The book was planned before their death in 2013, and includes 50 poems that they wrote between 1973, when they were at university at Sterling, and 1981, which was the year they began writing The Wasp Factory and abruptly stopped writing poetry. There are a couple of familiar pieces in there, including both “Zakalwe's Song” and “Slight Mechanical Destruction” which bookended Use of Weapons, and, of course, they used odd lines from their poetry as song lyrics in Espedair Street, but mostly this is stuff we've never seen before, and if they betray strong influence from T.S. Eliot and also from the songs they were listening to in the 70s, they are still good and in some cases very good poems. They are accompanied by 28 poems from Ken MacLeod, who began writing poetry at about the same time as Banks, but never stopped, so these cover a longer period of time and in some cases are even more accomplished.
When Poems came out, we also learned that Banks had hoped that MacLeod would write another Culture novel. Unfortunately, they died earlier than anticipated, so their notes for the novel were not far enough advanced to make the project possible.
What can you say after that? So, a moment's silence … and then onwards.
February has been a month when publishers have started to wake up after the winter break, so we've seen new volumes in a couple of well-received series. First up is Tamaruq, the third and final part in The Osiris Project Trilogy by E.J. Swift (DelRey). Adelaide Rechnov is now a revolutionary and on the run when a radio signal brings the stark realisation that there is life outside their small island. Alongside this comes Rook Song, the sequel to Astra by Naomi Foyle (Jo Fletcher Books), in which exiled Astra Ordott struggles to find their Code father and avenge the death of their Shelter mother.
Solaris has a couple of interesting looking books out this month, starting with Signal to Noise by Silvia Moreno-Garcia which begins in Mexico in 1988 when Meche learns to cast spells using music. If anything, Cannonbridge by Jonathan Barnes looks even more intriguing, it's the story of Matthew Cannonbridge who was one of the great literary figures of the 19th century, who was present at the Villa Diodati when Mary Shelley conceived Frankenstein, they knew Charles Dickens in the blacking factory, and they were the only figure of note to visit Oscar Wilde in prison. Except they shouldn't have existed, something is wrong with history.
Titan seems to go for slightly quirkier works, such as Finn Fancy Necromancy by Randy Henderson, who won the 2014 Writers of the Future Contest, and whose title seems to owe more than a little to Tove Jansson. Or there's Of Bone and Thunder by Chris Evans, a fantasy which is set in some version of the Vietnam War, and which is memorably being described as “Apocalypse Now meets Lord of the Rings.”
And, of course, there are big names out there. Del Rey UK has finally brought out a UK edition of Rapture, the final part of Kameron Hurley's Bel Dame Apocrypha trilogy. Tor UK has Dark Intelligence, the first volume in a new triology set in the Polity universe by Neal Asher. And Headline gives us the new collection of short stories by Neil Gaiman, Trigger Warning.
Of course, February is also the start of the award season, with two shortlists announced on the same day. The Kitschies offers a shortlist for the Red Tentacle novel prize that comprises Nnedi Okorafor (Lagoon), Andrew Smith (Grasshopper Jungle), William Gibson (The Peripheral), Will Wiles (The Way Inn) and Nina Allan (The Race).
Nina Allan and Nnedi Okorafor also feature on the shortlist for the BSFA Award for Best Novel, though in this instance the shortlist is not so short. There was, apparently, a four-way tie for fourth place, so there are eight titles on the Novel shortlist: Nina Allan (The Race), Frances Hardinge (Cuckoo Song), Dave Hutchinson (Europe in Autumn), Simon Ings (Wolves), Ann Leckie (Ancillary Sword), Claire North (The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August), Nnedi Okorafor (Lagoon) and Neil Williamson (The Moon King).
In the spirit of full disclosure, I should mention that my own book, Call and Response (remember, I did make a passing reference to it once or twice in the last year), has been shortlisted for the Best Non-Fiction Award. Though it is up against stiff competition: Jonathan McCalmont's “Deep Forests and Manicured Gardens”, Edward James's “Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers and the First World War”, Karen Burnham's Greg Egan, and the Strange Horizon Symposium on “The State of British SF and Fantasy” which featured, among others, my wife, Maureen Kincaid Speller. The results will be announced at Easter.

British sf critic Paul Kincaid is the author of the Hugo Award-nominated What It Is We Do When We Read Science Fiction and a just-released collection of reviews, Call And Response (Beccon). They have won both the Thomas D. Clareson Award and the BSFA Non-Fiction Award.

(CNN) -- New Jersey lawmakers have voted to abolish the death penalty in the state, sending the governor a bill they have already said they will sign. The measure will make New Jersey the first state in more than 40 years to outlaw capital punishment.
New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine, in a file photo, has said he'll sign the bill abolishing the death penalty.
The bill will make life in prison the most severe penalty for convicted murderers in the state, including the eight men currently on the state's death row. New Jersey has not put anyone to death since 1963, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
The state Assembly approved the measure 44-36 Thursday, following up Monday's 21-16 approval in the state Senate.
A spokesperson for Democratic Gov. Jon Corzine said the bill probably will be signed into law within a few days, after the exact text is reviewed closely.
"The governor has said for quite some time that they support the bill," said spokesperson Jim Gardner.

The bill was introduced in November, after a state commission concluded capital punishment does not prevent violent crime, and could lead to innocent people being executed.
Some Republicans had argued police killers and terrorists should still be eligible for execution, but Democrats, who control both houses, backed the change.
"This vote marks a new chapter in our nation's 30-year experiment with capital punishment," said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, which opposes executions.
"New Jersey lawmakers are demonstrating sound judgment in abandoning capital punishment after learning of its costs, the pain it causes victims' families, and the risks the death penalty poses to innocent lives."
The Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, and nearly 1,100 people have since been put to death. Capital punishment is used by 37 states, most using lethal injection of chemicals. Electrocution, the gas chamber, hanging, and the firing squad are still on the books in some states.

The most recent execution in the United States took place September 25 in Texas.
A de facto moratorium has been in place since the Supreme Court decided to review lethal injection procedures used on the majority of capital defendants. Oral arguments in the case will be held January 7 and, depending on how the high court rules, executions could be postponed indefinitely.
The last states to ban the death penalty were West Virginia and Iowa in 1965.
Among those on death row in New Jersey is Jesse Timmendequas, whose murder of 7-year-old Megan Kanka in 1994 led to reforms in tracking sex offenders. The state's Megan's Law requires local law enforcement agencies to give notification when convicted sex offenders live or work in neighborhoods. E-mail to a friend

Nostalgia for the '90s has a special double potency. The decade is now old enough that we can look back at it with the same bittersweet remember when? tug that powered '80s nostalgia and '70s nostalgia — and, before that, the 1962 nostalgia of “American Graffiti” (the movie that was the true launchpad of nostalgia culture). There's a great deal in the '90 to get nostalgic about: “Seinfeld” and Tarantino, “Sex and the City” and “Boogie Nights”; the Clinton boom and the Clinton scandals; the return of martinis; the rise of boy bands and grunge, Snoop Dogg and Eminem; the earthquake that was O.J.; and on and on. Yet part of the decade's uniqueness came from what wasn't there. It was the last moment before the Internet took over, and along with it a certain aura of technological control. I'd argue that with rose-colored hindsight (and when it comes to nostalgia, is there any other kind?), that's part of what made the '90s so bold and alluring, so relaxed and unhinged. So free.
“Trainspotting,” Danny Boyle's movie about four Scottish wastrels throwing their lives away on heroin, came out in 1996, and if you go back and watch it now, every squalid frame of it pulses with the freedom of the '90s. The movie is set in the gutter, in icky sordid flats and junk dens, in “the worst toilet in Scotland,” yet the entire thing is recklessly and thrillingly alive. It's a tale of addiction that's really a movie about the liberation of not giving a fuck.

Choose your friends…Choose sitting on that couch watching mind-numbing spirit-crushing game shows stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth”), is a catharsis, because it's an embrace of life in the guise of an unholy rejection of it. It's like the opening of “A Hard Day's Night” rewritten by Charles Bukowski (or, in this case, by their inheritor Irvine Welsh). The characters in “Trainspotting” reject everything except getting higher than high, yet in scene after scene we taste their hunger, the nakedness of their desire for something outside the realm of what life has promised them. They're raffish lowlifes who have slipped away from having a dream. But they're also everyone living the middle-class dream who knows it's a mirage.
The Danny Boyle who decided, 20 years later, to make a sequel to “Trainspotting” is a different director now than they were then. “Trainspotting” was only Boyle's second feature, and he's come up in the world since; they are now an Esteemed Academy Award Winner. Yet going back to discover where the characters from “Trainspotting” landed was, in theory, an inspired idea, because if there's anything the pop-culture world could use today, it's an uncut dose of what was great about the '90s — an era when the audacity and decadent daring of a movie like “Trainspotting” could get right inside an audience's bloodstream.
Yet “T2: Trainspotting” is not that movie. As fans have discovered by now, it's a weary tale of downtrodden, no-expectations middle age. In the opening scene, Renton is running again, only this time on a gym treadmill, where they collapse and has a minor heart attack. It's a depressing kickoff, not because Renton suffers a physical trauma or even because he's apparently clean and sober. It's depressing because the movie can't come up with anything better to symbolize their new state of being than that ancient cliché: the yuppie workout. Renton, we learn, is married but getting a divorce, and since their wife owns their apartment in Amsterdam, they have nowhere to go. So they drift back to Edinburgh to look up their old friends: Spud (Bremner), still a junkie, now teetering on the edge of suicide (Renton saving them from the barf-blasted baggie in which they try to suffocate themselves is one of the film's few joltingly funny moments), and Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), now a pimp with one dominatrix who uses them to rig up voyeur-cam blackmail schemes.
All three are up to not very much, and “T2: Trainspotting” is one of those sequels in which the characters spend way too much time lounging around recalling the old days, because that's really a way of recalling the first movie. The entire film, it turns out, is organized around the sixteen thousand pounds in drug money that Renton made off with at the end of “Trainspotting” (slipping four thousand of it to Spud in a locker). It was a betrayal, and a death dare, and Robert Carlyle's Begbie, who has sprung themselves out of prison, wants revenge. In the first movie, Carlyle had a disarming sleekness that made their brogue-ish jibber-jabber and bloody sloshed machismo all the more shocking; you had to keep reminding yourself that smashing beer mugs into people's faces wasn't normal behavior (though apparently in Scotland it is). But Carlyle is doughier now, and Begbie's rage no longer has that maniacal edge. He's just an angry bloke with a grudge, which makes the plot of “T2: Trainspotting” about as interesting as that of an “Expendables” sequel.
It's a dismally mediocre movie, a portrait of dead-end middle age in which the characters fail to enthrall us because they seem so unenthralled with themselves. Of course, you could argue (as a handful of critics has) that there's something tragic and true in that: that Boyle and company have made a sequel about the scary passing of youth and the way that indolence can take over. But “T2: Trainspotting” is a classic demonstration of the imitative fallacy — i.e., a film about glum, bone-tired middle age shouldn't be glum and bone-tired. Besides, when you make a sequel to a beloved movie, I don't care whether it's “The Godfather” or “Star Wars” or “Toy Story” or “The Fast and the Furious,” you owe the audience a second dose of what it was that made the original film great. “Trainspotting” was about the crazy glory of addiction, and that's what's missing from “T2.” It has no addictive fever at all. It's more like a film that tries to do penance by putting the first movie in rehab.
Much of the film was taken from the Irvine Welsh novel “Porno” (his follow-up to “Trainspotting”), so we're supposed to say: It's just honoring its sacred source! But Danny Boyle is a powerful filmmaker who could have shaped this movie any way they wanted. And what they should have done is to take the characters back to a place of dark and dangerous pleasure. After all, it's not as if addiction is now the province of the young. Thanks, in part, to the momentous rise of the pharmaceutical drug industry, it's doubtful that the world has ever seen so many middle-aged drug addicts. Getting hooked — on opioids, meth, heroin — out of desperation and poverty and boredom has become the underground religion of our time. And if any movie under the black hole sun was going to give expression to that phenomenon, it could and should have been the sequel to “Trainspotting.”
Maybe that's the difference between the '90s and the decade we're in now. So much of the allure of that earlier time is that it could afford to be carefree about the demons that ail us all. The current era is much more guarded, because it feels like there's more to lose. But that shouldn't be an excuse for overly cautious filmmaking; if anything, it's art that can help to lead us back to a place of greater freedom. “T2: Trainspotting” is a movie about aging bad boys in which the only overdose on-screen is one of stifling do-right correctness.
That's how you know they're playing the long game. KrisAnne Hall, a radio host who teaches seminars on the Constitution, tells National Review Online that they and a number of other Florida-based conservative activists hope to recall Senator Marco Rubio. But there's one catch: You can't recall U.S. senators in Florida. But that isn't stopping them. Hall says they and others are working to draft state legislation that would allow for senators to face recall votes. They say that once they put the legislation together, they plan to muster support from grassroots activists, get the Florida state legislature to pass the bill, and then recall the senator, who next faces reelection in 2016.

Hall tells me that the tea-party voters who put Rubio in office are frustrated with their career thus far, especially their support for the Gang of Eight's immigration legislation.
“They're done with him,” they say of Florida's tea-party activists. “They're not voting for them and they're angry. They're angry because they feel they've been deceived.”
As an interesting side note, there's already a petition calling for Rubio's recall, and it's gotten more than 3,500 signatures. Breitbart's Javier Manjarres reported on it here. “Conservatives who backed Rubio in 2010 are calling for their head,” they wrote. “No, they are not really calling for their head, but are calling for their job.”
That petition, however, wasn't actually put together by conservatives. WatchdogWire reported on June 29 (a day before the Breitbart story was published) that the petition was actually started by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Per WatchdogWire, signatories receive an email saying,
Thank you for taking action through Care2 to protect America's middle class and to keep our country moving forward. The DCCC is committed to supporting Democrats across the country because the success of President Obama's agenda depends on a strongDemocratic majority.

Who knows? Maybe conservatives' recall legislation will get bipartisan support.
“We need to recognize this reality that China will likely continue with its destabilizing activities unless and until it perceives that the costs of doing so outweigh the benefits.”
That quote is from US Senator and ardent war hawk John McCain and as you might have guessed, he's referring to China's land reclamation project in The South China Sea. On Friday, we noted that the US claims to have spotted artillery on the islands which Washington says constitutes further proof that Beijing's efforts in the Spratlys are aimed primarily at serving a military purpose, although it's not entirely clear to anyone what that purpose might be.
Defense Secretary Ash Carter — who last week assured China that the US would sail and fly anywhere it chose — again criticized China's activities on Saturday at the Shangri-La Dialogue, a security event in Singapore. Carter also reportedly announced a half-billion dollar maritime security initiative presumably aimed at discouraging China from aggressively moving ahead with efforts to create sovereign territory where it did not previously exist.
WSJ has more:
Mr. Carter in their speech again called for “a lasting halt” to the land reclamation by China and others in the South China Sea, noting that the U.S., unlike China, isn't staking any land claims in the region, but is seeking stability. Mr. Carter also formally announced what they called a Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative, likely to be funded by Congress to the tune of $425 million to help build maritime security capacity among nations in the region… Mr. Carter noted that the other countries have built outposts in what are known as the Spratly Islands, including Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Taiwan. “Yet, one country has gone much farther and much faster than anyone other, and that's China,” Mr. Carter said. They noted that China had built 2,000 acres of new land mass in the past 18 months. “It is unclear how much farther China will go,” they said. “That is why this stretch of water has become the source of tension in the region and front-page news around the world.”
The DoD outlined Carter's speech and elaborated on ways the US plans to promote "collective security" including peace-promoting activites like building new long-range bombers and investing in the development of "electromagnetic railguns [and] lasers," and deploying P-8 Poseidon surveillance planes (the same plane which the Chinese Navy recently told to "Go Now!" when it came too close to the Spratlys).
Via DoD:
Carter explained the purpose of America's rebalance to the Asia-Pacific is about sustaining the progress occurring all around the region and helping it continue to fulfill its promise. The defense secretary said they are “personally committed” to the next phase of the rebalance where DoD will deepen “long-standing alliances and partnerships,” while diversifying America's force posture, and making new investments in key capabilities and platforms. According to Carter, this includes investing in technologies most relevant to the complexity of the security environment there, such as new unmanned systems for the air and sea, a new long-range bomber, and other technologies like the electromagnetic railgun, lasers, and new systems for space and cyberspace. As new systems are developed, they said, “DoD will continue to bring the best platforms and people forward to the Asia-Pacific.” This includes, Carter said, the latest Virginia-class submarines, the Navy's P-8 Poseidon surveillance aircraft, the newest stealth destroyer, the Zumwalt, and brand-new carrier-based E-2D Hawkeye early-warning-and-control aircraft. The defense secretary said the Asia-Pacific has never had a region-wide alliance like NATO in Europe, and encouraged partnership in promoting regional peace, stability, and security [including] enhanc[ing] the capacities of the regional security architecture, particularly on maritime security such as DoD's new Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative.
(The railgun in action)
(The P-8 Poseidon which is armed with torpedoes, cruise missiles, bombs, and mines)
The Chinese, who were also in attendance in Singapore, called Carter's remarks “acceptable”, but when pressed about what it is exactly that Beijing is trying to accomplish in the region, the country's delegation was allegedly vague. Here's WSJ again:
Noting the military usefulness of the islets China is constructing in the disputed Spratly Islands, Adm. Sun Jianguo, deputy chief of staff of the People's Liberation Army's general staff, said they would mainly enable China to provide “international public services,” including maritime search and rescue, disaster relief, and scientific research... “There is no reason for people to play up the issue in the South China Sea,” Adm. Sun said on Sunday at the Shangri-La Dialogue security summit in Singapore, where discussions involving regional defense ministers and military top brass have been completely dominated by the implications of China's island-building program. The new islands “do not target any other countries, or affect freedom of navigation,” they said… Malaysian armed forces chief Gen. Zulkifeli Mohd. Zin said Sunday that China should do more to explain its actions and intentions in the South China Sea, after Adm. Sun dodged questions on the subject. “We do not know what they are trying to do,” Gen. Zulkifeli said, referring to Beijing's island-building activities. “It would be good if China can come out publicly and announce what they are doing so that they can be seen to be more transparent”... Adm. Sun didn't answer a string of questions about whether Chinese rhetoric about seeking win-win scenarios in the South China Sea really matched China's behavior on the ground, disappointing observers who felt that they had wasted an opportunity to explain Chinese intentions.
We'll close with the following quote from Adm. Sun about what might happen should someone navigate too closely to these public service-providing islands which "do not affect freedom of navigation":
The officer and Yassine Atar (pictured) are believed to have been in contact before the attacks. The officer was detained on Monday and accused of violating the police code of conduct and corruption.  They are thought to have leaked confidential information to people under scrutiny in a terrorism investigation. The officer is believed to have been in contact with Yassine Atar, the brother of Oussama Atar, who is suspected of organising the Brussels attacks on the metro and the airport via WhatsApp. The Atar Brothers are nephews of the El Bakraoui Brothers, who blew themselves up during the metro and airport attacks.
Yassine Atar is Oussama Atar's younger brother. He's been in custody since they were detained five days after the attacks. Their exact role is unclear, though they are believed to be a pivotal figure.
A compound that is not an organic compound
An inorganic compound is typically a chemical compound that lacks C-H bonds, that is, a compound that is not an organic compound, but the distinction is not defined or even of particular interest.[1][2][3]
Inorganic compounds comprise most of the Earth's crust, although the compositions of the deep mantle remain active areas of investigation.[4]
Some simple compounds that contain carbon are often considered inorganic. Examples include carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, carbonates, cyanides, cyanates, carbides, and thiocyanates. Many of these are normal parts of mostly organic systems, including organisms, which means that describing a chemical as inorganic does not obligately mean that it does not occur within living things.
Wöhler synthesis [ edit ]
Friedrich Wöhler's conversion of ammonium cyanate into urea in 1828 is considered the starting point of modern organic chemistry.[5] The Wöhler synthesis is of great historical significance because for the first time an organic compound (urea) was produced from inorganic precursors (the salt ammonium cyanate). This finding contradicted the then-mainstream theory vitalism, which stated that organic matter possessed a special force or vital force inherent to all things living. Prior to Wöhler's experiment, a sharp boundary was thought to separate organic and inorganic compounds.
Modern usage [ edit ]
The Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) in its definition of "inorganic" carbon compounds, states that such compounds may contain either C-H or C-C bonds, but not both. [6]
C-H or C-C bonds, but not both. The book series Inorganic Syntheses does not define inorganic compounds. The majority of its content deals with metal complexes of organic ligands. [7]
IUPAC does not offer a definition of "inorganic" or "inorganic compound" but does define inorganic polymer as "...skeletal structure that does not include carbon atoms."[8]

How to add permanent static routes in Ubuntu Linux
In this tutorial we are going to learn how to add permanent static route in Ubuntu Linux.
For this tutorial I am using Ubuntu Server 16.04, But you can use the following method to add Persistent route in any previous Ubuntu version including Ubuntu Desktop.
What is a Persistent route ?
In Ubuntu, permanent static routes also called as Persistent routes are the static route entries that will not be deleted when the network restart or when the system restarts.
Typically in a Linux System, route add and ip route add commands are used to add static routes to the routing table. But those static route entries get deleted from the routing table when either network or system restart.
So how we can make static routes permanent?
Making Static Routes Persistent in Ubuntu Linux
In Ubuntu Linux, in order to make Static Routes Persistent, we need to add route entries to the network interface file (/etc/network/interfaces) using up lines.
Example
Following is the sample Ubuntu network interface configuration file with permanent static route entries.
auto enp0s3 iface enp0s3 inet static address 192.168.1.10 netmask 255.255.255.0 gateway 192.168.1.1 up route add -net 192.168.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.15 up route add -net 192.168.10.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev enp2s0
As per the above example, we have added two permanent static route entries using the “up” argument.
the "up" lines are executed when the interface is brought up. So when network restart, those route entries will be added to the routing table automatically.
You need to restart Ubuntu networking, if you add a new route entry to the /etc/network/interfaces file.
service networking restart
You can view the routing table using the ip route show command.
ip route show
Examples - Persistent routes in Ubuntu Linux
up route add -net 192.168.10.0 netmask 255.255.255.128 gw 192.168.1.1
Gateway for the network 192.168.10.0 is 192.168.1.1.
up route add -net 192.56.76.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth1
Network 192.56.76.0 route through the network interface eth1.
up route add -host 192.168.10.100 gw 192.168.1.1
As per the above example, host 192.168.1.100 will route through the gateway 192.168.1.1.
So that is how we add permanent routes in Ubuntu Linux. This method uses to add Persistent route in all Debian Based Linux Distributions.
Ingress, the Alternate/Augmented Reality (AR) game from Google's Niantic Labs, is a major evolution of mobile gaming. Apparently, it's also a good way to get arrested.
According to a post on Reddit (I know, I know – but stay with me on this), an Ingress player in Ohio was detained by police for their in-game actions. Specifically, they were “hacking a portal” near a police station. Their phone had technical difficulties, which led them to linger by the portal/police station for a bit, catching the eye of local law enforcement and leading to the detention.
After the original post, other Ingress players responded with similar stories. One aroused suspicions by wandering around an empty parking lot at night. Another, trying to hack a portal next to an air traffic control station, had to run from the local sheriff. A third was called in for questioning after hacking a portal outside of a “high-traffic drug area.”
It's In The Game
As Dan Rowinski mentioned in their earlier post, there's plenty of “creep” factor built into the game. In fact, much like geocaching (Ingress' non-digital ancestor), lurking in strange and hard-to-get-to places at odd hours is kind of the point.
Getting detained (as many Redditors pointed out, the poster wasn't technically arrested) probably adds to the intrigue, and certainly gives a player a certain amount of street cred. It could also call into question the boundary between the First Amendment and public safety.
Legal, But Risky
All Ingress' portals are on public land. There's no law against walking past a police station, post office or airport. There are, however, very legitimate safety concerns held by the people charged with protecting those facilities and keeping an eye out for potential risks.
As one law enforcement professional joked, “I hope they don't put one of those in front of the White House.” In fact, there are apparently a bunch of portals in front of the White House, embassies and other sites that could be high-interest targets for vandalism or worse.
At least Ingress doesn't require players to dig up or bury physical objects, a phenomenon that has caused some high-profile problems in the geocaching community. Still, as similar games take off (and they will), we're going to see more friction between gamers and law enforcement, particularly in full AR environments that use cameras. In addition to trespassing and loitering violations, there's greatly increased potential for distraction, perhaps leading gamers to injure themselves or others. It's all the danger of texting – plus headphones – with the added possibility of being labeled a terrorist by overzealous cops.
The Future
By all accounts, Niantic labs has been responsible about these issues. The game doesn't encourage trespassing or dangerous behavior, like using your phone in a car. Other developers may not feel the same sense of duty, or their goals may encourage “creative” players to take unnecessary risks.
If enough negligence, trespassing, and public nuisance suits (and maybe some claims of police harassment) hit the courts, we'll eventually wind up with legislation governing the balance between gameplay and public safety. We might see an increase of no-device buffer zones around sensitive areas, or certain games limiting accounts to only users of age to accept legal responsibility for their actions. There could even be outright bans on AR games in certain areas.
Until then, it's up to game developers to police themselves and players to stay smart. One dumb move could lead to a ton of regulation that could really spoil everyone's fun.

BELGRADE (Reuters) - Rising numbers of migrants from the Middle East and Central Asia are ending up homeless in sub-zero temperatures in Serbia with more arriving from Bulgaria as countries further along the so-called Balkan corridor to western Europe tighten their borders.
Serbian authorities and international agencies are unable to house all the newcomers, with about a fifth of the almost 7,000 sleeping rough in Belgrade city center or at the border with Hungary, according to the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR).
“We are concerned that the migrant crisis has not abated and there are things we cannot influence,” Serbia's minister for labor, employment, veterans and social policy, Aleksandar Vulin, said at the weekend.
In Belgrade, where temperatures are dropping as low as minus 6 degrees Celsius (21 degrees Fahrenheit) at night and barely rising above freezing by day, around a thousand people are living in derelict warehouses near Belgrade train station.
Many are without blankets and they burn railway sleepers inside the bare concrete building for warmth. Meals distributed by charities are not sufficient for all the inhabitants.
“It's all like living in hell - smoke everywhere, cold, people are coming every night from Bulgaria,” said a young man from Afghanistan who gave their name as Jamshaid.
Dozens of migrants, mainly from Afghanistan, were taken to hospital in Croatia on Sunday after police stopped a van carrying 67 people and arrested two Bulgarian citizens suspected of human trafficking.
“It's not easy to cross the border with smugglers now. We know they're cutting the fence into Hungary,” said Jamshaid. “We will go on our own, we won't have a smuggler with us.”
Fellow migrant Podari, from Pakistan, said some had tried to cross the border into Croatia but had been caught and beaten.
The Balkan route used by hundreds of thousands of migrants fleeing conflict to reach western Europe has been made far more difficult in the past year, with countries tightening border controls or erecting fences. But loopholes remain, including a fairly porous boundary between Serbia and Bulgaria.
During my research for an upcoming book* on the life and work of German Renaissance typographer Erhard Ratdolt, I spent quite some time looking at the introduction of printing to Italy (Ratdolt worked in Venice from 1476 to 1486, thereafter returning to their native Augsburg). The first printers in Italy were, unsurprisingly, from Germany, and they likely were associated with Gutenberg, Fust and Schoeffer. I won't go into the details about the introduction of printing to Italy. Suffice to say, by 1465 Sweynheym and Pannartz had arrived at the Benedictine monastery of Subiaco, about 60 km east of Rome. The same year they printed a Latin Grammar (a schoolbook that had been incredibly popular throughout the Middle Ages) by the fourth-century tutor of Jerome, the Roman Grammarian Aelius Donatus, of which, sadly, no copy has survived.
Some time before the end of September 1465**, they printed Cicero's De oratore, the first extant book printed on Italian soil. Lastly, before moving their press to Rome, they printed their first dated book (29 October, 1465), Opera by the third-century author, Lactantius.
The page below is from their De oratore of 1465:
Photo credit: University of Barcelona. [For a larger version of the same type (but used in the Lactantius).]
This is the first Roman type. More accurately it is a semi-Roman or semi-Gothic, the letterforms modeled on contemporary Italian book-hands. The capitals are clearly roman; the N is unusual in that its diagonal stroke meets the right stem quite high — like I have seen in some Rustic capitals in later Medieval manuscript books (though Rustic capitals are, of course, more condensed). The G looks almost like a sans serif and has a tiny aperture. In the lowercase there are more than traces of the uncial letter, especially in the form of the h with its toes turned in. The lowercase still retains some of the angularity and lateral compression of the Gothic letter. Though the type is quite dark (and has low contrast), it is tightly spaced and rather condensed, but appears much lighter than a page of Gothic type owing to the relatively long descenders, creating more interlinear white space. Relatively few contractions and ligatures — a t + i ligature and a nice disconnected c + t ligature. Note the spur on the, a remnant of the Gothic letter. The squat ampersand is quite beautiful too.

I think it's quite incredible that this book and its type has survived, and that just about all of the type we read today owes a debt to proto-typographers like Sweynheym and Pannartz.
*Erhard Ratdolt — Renaissance Typographer, to be published later this year — fingers crossed!
**The Leipzig copy, now in Moscow, contains annotations dated 30 September, 1465.
Apparently no longer content with the 28-day window in which it sells DVDs but doesn't allow companies to rent them out, Warner Bros. is reportedly on the verge of doubling that time frame in an effort to starve viewers into starting to buy movies again.
According to AllThingsD, Warner Bros. is gearing up to announce the new window at next week's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The 56-day rental ban will apply to Netflix, Redbox and Blockbuster.
Along with the revelation that HBO will no longer play nice with Netflix, studios are making it known that they're not in the business of helping disc renters. Stretching the release windows, however, may well drive otherwise honest customers to piracy.

Mac developers intrigued by Ruby's ease of use and simple maintainability but deterred by its turgid performance will be happy to hear that MacRuby 0.5 - aka its "experimental branch" - is remarkably snappy.
Exactly how snappy is remarkably snappy? A suite of low-level benchmark tests recently performed by Antonio Cangiano of Zen and the Art of Programming shows MacRuby 0.5 to be on average just under three times as fast as Ruby 1.9.1, with some operations coming in at nearly eight times faster.
According to Cagiano: "MacRuby... has the potential to become a game changer - at least for Mac developers. Based on Ruby 1.9, MacRuby's main aim is to provide programmers with the ability to write Mac OS X applications in Ruby, making Ruby a first-class Cocoa programming language."
The MacRuby open-source development project is sponsored by Apple, which includes an introduction to the language on its Developer Connection website. You can also download a free version of the most-recently qualified development version, MacRuby 0.4, from Apple's software vault.
MacRuby's raison d'être is to overcome the performance limitations of RubyCocoa, which functions as a speed-robbing intercommunication bridge between the Mac OS X Objective-C runtime component and the standard Ruby interpreter.
Simply put, the MacRuby project is working to create a Ruby implementation that sits directly on top of the Objective-C runtime, eliminating the RubyCocoa bridge.
Cagiano claimed that MacRuby 0.4 - which allows a developer to deliver an application in a standard Mac OS X .app package - is both stable and effective. However, they said that MacRuby's real promise lies in MacRuby 0.5, which they called "freakishly fast."
It appears that Mac developers may soon have another full-fledged - and either remarkably snappy or freakishly fast - Cocoa-compliant development language with which to deliver desktop applications.
More information and up-to-date news on the MacRuby development effort can be found at MacRuby.org. ®
Science and business, so far, have been mostly model driven. That is, you collect a few data points, just enough to fit your model. Then you proceed from your model. However, things have changed:
old new Manually take samples of the water in a nearby lake (4 times a year) Setup a wireless sensor in the lake (5000 samples a day) Model an algorithm and test it once on expensive mainframe computer Build dozens of prototypes and test them on cheap laptops Have an accountant prepare a business intelligence report, once a year See how the business is doing through your dynamic data warehouse
Hence, improving access to data is fast becoming a critical issue. In a thought-provoking post, Andre Vellino sketches the future of data Information Retrieval. Some key points:
Back in the early nineties, we had many electronic documents, but a comparatively poor infrastructure to share them. Then came the web and the search engines such as Google. Currently, we have many good data sets, but sharing and indexing them is painful. Clearly, we need to produce a better infrastructure for sharing data!
Research papers should reference data sets, by a unique identifier (such as a Digital Object Identifier), so that we can ask “What research relied on this data set?” or “Where can I find the data these authors have used?”
This is one instance where funding agencies should step in and encourage this work. It is not enough to encourage researchers to share their data. We need better tools too!
It's been one of the worst kept secrets in Melbourne beer circles and now it's official: Fixation Brewing is set to open its own brewery in Collingwood next April.
The venue, which is currently going under the working title of Fixation Brewery and Tasting Room, will give the brand a home for its beers while also allowing the IPA focused brewery to release more limited batches. Fixation will also be the fourth brewery to call Collingwood home, joining The Mill Brewery, The Craft & Co and Stomping Ground in setting Collingwood on a path to become inner Melbourne's brewing quarter.
Mr Fixation, Tom Delmont, who runs the brewing company in partnership with the Stone & Wood Group, says the idea for a permanent home goes right back to the early days of Fixation and describes their excitement at finally having a site for the “hoppiest place on earth”.
“At the moment we don't have a home and we've always planned to provide that down the track,” says Tom. “It's about having a place where we can host trade, customers and fans of Fixation to experience our home for themselves.”
Once open, the 600 litre batches from the pilot brewery will mostly be sold over the bar, with the bulk of Fixation's beers still coming out of Stone & Wood's Murwillumbah and Byron Bay breweries. The man responsible for brewing all those new IPAs is Stone & Wood alumni Sam Bethune, who was looking to return to Victoria to be closer to theirs and their partner's family.
Tom says the reason Fixation's Melbourne home has been such an open secret was entirely intentional. Both Tom and the Square Keg team (who distribute Fixation alongside the likes of Pikes Beer Company and New Belgium) didn't want to damage their relationships with any of the bars by making it feel the decision came out of nowhere.
“We've been on the front foot with trade and have been encouraging the Square Keg guys on the road to have those chats,” they say. “It's not going to be a competing pub or live music venue or restaurant but a tasting room and brewery for us.”
While the Fixation bar will serve food, the plan for the venue is to showcase what their business is all about and also give those customers who often ask if they can visit Fixation the ability to do just that.
“I know people cry sometimes when they visit their favourite brewery that they haven't been to before,” says Tom, who will no doubt be hoping there are Fixation fans out there who'll do the same.
With the number of Australian brewing companies at its greatest level ever and expanding at a rate of knots, Tom also says it's increasingly necessary for breweries to have a customer facing option for their drinkers.
“I think having a home and taking that step is getting more and more important and it shows that you're in it for the long term. Having a place that people can touch, see and smell is going to be more and more important as time goes on.”
While no packaging is planned for the brewpub, punters will be able to take home growler fills – under strict orders to drink them quickly.
“The key with some styles of beer is to drink it super fresh,” says Tom. “If you have that visitor space where people can pick up a beer on the way out and they'll drink it in the next few days, then that's the ultimate experience for a hoppy beer lover.”
Those who know Tom will be aware that their love of IPAs is, perhaps, only outweighed by a love for live music and Melbourne's finest dive bars, yet they insist Fixation Brewery and Tasting Room won't be all about the music.
“Unfortunately, there will be no live music," they say. "That end of the city is changing a bit and I don't think the residents would be that keen on having The Bennies playing inside.
“We're just hoping to make nice aromas of hops and malt waft out of the place – that will be the extent of our impact on the neighbours.”

Fiction ... Reality is not as exciting as this
The latest cache of classified intelligence documents dumped online by WikiLeaks includes files describing malware CIA apparently uses to track PCs via Wi‑Fi.
The Julian Assange-led website claims the spyware, codenamed ELSA, infects a target's Windows computer and then harvests wireless network details to pinpoint the location of the machine. The software nasty is said to pull data from Google and Microsoft in order to pinpoint the real-world location of the infiltrated machine.
"ELSA is a geo-location malware for Wi‑Fi enabled devices like laptops running the Microsoft Windows operating system," says WikiLeaks.
"Once persistently installed on a target machine using separate CIA exploits, the malware scans visible Wi‑Fi access points and records the ESS identifier, MAC address and signal strength at regular intervals."
ELSA is one more weapon in the suite of malware tools the CIA uses to infiltrate the machines of people under investigation. It is used in combination with other exploits and tracking tools.
"The collected access point/geo-location information is stored in encrypted form on the device for later exfiltration," WikiLeaks says.
"The malware itself does not beacon this data to a CIA back-end; instead the operator must actively retrieve the log file from the device – again using separate CIA exploits and backdoors."
Before you go into hysterics, take a moment to breathe into a paper bag and remember that ELSA is used against CIA targets, and if you're the subject of a CIA intelligence operation you have way, way more to worry about than the integrity of your wireless network.
Besides, you're far more likely to be compromised by a webpage, GIF, or Excel spreadsheet from a run-of-the-mill cybercrook. ®
Turn 3 begins!
Wow, you can move entire airbases. Just up and move 'em to wherever there's a friendly airfield. Neat.
I don't think the Iranians have anything at all to fear from the enemy air forces except for interdiction missions cutting off ground unit supply. They aren't numerous or high quality enough to cause a great deal of damage against Iranian ground units or airbases. I pretty much just keep Iranian air on offensive missions and let the air defense deal with the occasional ineffective enemy air raid.
Still amazed at how vital trucks are in this game. I have a perpetual shortage of trucks and a continual surplus of things that I need them to do for me. At this point if my trucks were gone, I would almost certainly lose the game.
Things that look easy are not. Getting my guys down near Riyadh in a timely fashion is difficult. The fact that I've got armor trailing infantry seems really wrong but that's the price I'm paying for going in heavy with armor against Kuwait in the early turns.
Where is the best place to put this F-14 EW unit? It can only detect stuff that's 4 operational hexes away. I suppose it would work best over a friendly airbase that's vulnerable to enemy bombardment but I'm feeling pretty secure against attack anyways.
None of the units in the game so far are what you would call amazing or even pretty good. Iran has a shortage of support units and its planes can only take 2 hits before they are destroyed. Compared to the other enemy nations like the UAE or Saudi Arabia, however, it is a steamroller.
I realized way too late that the Saudi base in Al Hufuh needs a supply depot to keep it hooked into the Saudi supply network. I fib a bit with supply points and place the depot just east of Riyadh.
Using a deliberate assault by the 2nd Armored Division on the remnants of the Kuwaiti army was a huge waste of supply. A Hasty Assault or even an MC formation attack would have achieved the same results.
Can you spot the great big rookie mistake in this picture?
End of Turn 4
Doing well in the ground game is mainly a matter of knowing how to gain favorable column shifts through the use of formations, troop quality, terrain, and support. Amazing how one elite Saudi mech brigade beat the crap right out of a force that was twice its size and in good defensive terrain.
The Saudis are probably doing the right thing by forcing the Iranians to fight on Saudi terms. There's no question they will lose but they may be able to significantly delay the Iranian forces in a way that tilts the game against Iran from here on out.
I should have used the 9th or 10th infantry brigade to cover Kuwait City instead of using a battalion out of a broken-down 7th division. Now I won't be able to build up the 7th division because the individual units are too far away from each other.
There's an ebb and flow of supply points that you have to master in this game. There are times when you need to push everything and then right after, you need to do everything you can to just conserve those precious SPs for the next big battle. I spent the Iranian SPs like a drunken sailor in the first two or three turns and now I'm starting to wonder a bit if I'll be hurting when it comes to the big push on Riyadh.
First, it was the incriminating video of Jason Russell. Now, unbecoming footage of another one of Invisible Children's charity directors has surfaced.
TMZ obtained a clip of Jedidiah Jenkins, Invisible Children Director of Ideology, talking in slurred speech about how "rad" it was that they collected $1 million. It was apparently shot in 2010 after Invisible Children won the cash in the Chase Community Giving Facebook competition.
“Here's $100,000 for Haiti and $900,000 extra for me. Get on the bandwagon,” Jenkins says in the video.
Jenkins tells RumorFix exclusively that he's unfazed by the video and that the vodka bottle was "clearly filled with water."
“TMZ can't ruin my reputation,” they laughed. “I'm not worried.”
They say the video was created for a co-worker who was out of town when they won the prize and that the organization donated the money to fund education in northern Uganda.
“I was joking. It was made for my co-worker who was out of town when we won the prize. I made it for them to make them laugh and let them know we were thinking of them in the office. It's hilarious that anyone would think it anything other than a joke. I mean, who can drink that much Vodka? Definitely not me. I'd die. It's clearly water. I'm not gonna apologize for being a human that jokes with their friends. I'm just sad that bottom feeders like TMZ get pay checks for manufacturing controversy in real people's lives.”
It's not the first time that the organization behind the viral "Kony 2012" video has been criticized for its questionable spending.
According to Invisible Children's most recent budget report, it took in $13.8 million last year and spent $8.9 million. Of that, $3.3 million funded programs in Central Africa and the rest was spent on marketing, management, general expenses, media and "awareness products."
But the charity defended its spending strategy, saying that getting the word out is key in activating citizens.
"We've never pretended all the money goes to the ground, because we don't believe that's the best use," Jenkins told CBS. "The best use is spreading the word and then doing the highest-impact programs possible on the ground."
Does the knowledge that our species has a collective future influence the way we live in the present? For Francis Fukuyama, the author of The End of History and the Last Man, the answer to that question is a resounding yes.
Fukuyama, who is also the Olivier Nomellini senior fellow at Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, explored this question on Sept. 19 in Washington, D.C., during a screening of Alfonso Cuarón's Children of Men. The event was part of Future Tense's “My Favorite Movie” series, in which thought leaders host screenings of and discussions on their favorite movies with science and technology themes. Children of Men, the 2006 film adaptation of PD James' dystopian novel, is set in the year 2027, 18 years after the last child was born, due to worldwide infertility. In the video at the top of this post, filmed Sept. 21, Fukuyama expanded on the thoughts they shared at the screening.
Unlike apocalyptic tales which humanity's existential crisis is brought about through an abrupt event—like an alien invasion, nuclear war, or the threat of an asteroid crashing down to earth—Children of Men creates an alternative end-of-the-world scenario. Here, men and women continue to live out their lives, but must do so with the knowledge that the future is no longer accessible to their (our) species.
Fukuyama believes the film allows us to question what it means if there is no one to come after us, and whether our very existence is predicated on the understanding that others will follow. Fukuyama noted that this work of fiction increasingly resembles a reality, at least in some respects—some aging, increasingly infertile countries such as Taiwan and Japan will begin to face population crises in the not so distant future.
Delta Air Lines and Bank of America pulled out of their sponsorship of New York's Public Theater on Sunday over a production of “Julius Caesar” that reimagines the main character as President Trump.
Shortly after Delta, who was a four-year sponsor, made its announcement, Bank of America yanked its support as well.
The Shakespeare in the Park play tells the story of the leader assassinated by Roman senators over the fear that he's becoming too tyrannical, but rather than the original setting, the production stages Caesar (Gregg Henry) and their wife, Calpurnia, (Tina Benko) with Donald and Melania Trump lookalikes.
Henry, who already played a Trump stand-in on “Scandal” last year, models their Caesar almost perfectly after the man in the Oval Office. They meet their end after being stabbed to death by women and minorities on stage.
Benko, similarly, plays Calpurnia with a thick Slavic accent, much like Melania herself.
The recreation has drawn ire from those who say the show promotes violence against the President. Those critics include the President's son, Donald Trump Jr.
 "Danger knows full well that Caesar is more dangerous than he," reads a sign promoting the production. (Verena Dobnik/AP)
“I wonder how much of this ‘art' is funded by taxpayers? Serious question, when does ‘art' become political speech & does that change things?” the younger Trump tweeted Sunday in response to a Fox News article that accused the show of depicting the assassination of the President.
Delta, which donates between $100,000 and $499,000 annually, according to Deadline, pulled its sponsorship Sunday afternoon.
“No matter what your political stance may be, the graphic staging of Julius Caesar at this summer's Free Shakespeare in the Park does not reflect Delta Air Lines' values,” a company spokesperson said in a statement.
“Their artistic and creative direction crossed the line on the standards of good taste. We have notified them of our decision to end our sponsorship as the official airline of The Public Theater effective immediately.”
Bank of America, one of The Public Theaters's dozen corporate sponsors, offered similar reasoning.

“Bank of America supports art programs worldwide, including an 11-year partnership with The Public Theater and Shakespeare in the Park,” a spokesperson told the Daily News. “The Public Theater chose to present Julius Caesar in a way that was intended to provoke and offend. Had this intention been made known to us, we would have decided not to sponsor it.”
The show does include a warning about the violent nature of the assassination. On The Public Theater's website, artistic director Oskar Eustis said the production should not be taken literally.
“Julius Caesar can be read as a warning parable to those who try to fight for democracy by undemocratic means,” they said. “To fight the tyrant does not mean imitating him.”
In a statement to WPIX 11 , they said “anyone seeing our production of ‘Julius Caesar' will realize it in no way advocates violence towards anyone.”
Eustis previously told The News that President Trump was more than welcome to see their shows, including “Hamilton,” which debuted at The Public Theater in February 2015 and moved to Broadway's Richard Rodgers Theatre the following August.

“He's the President of the United States,” they told The News. “I'm not going to say no to the President to see our show.”
The artistic director said he'd hosted politicians before, including Vice President Mike Pence, who was booed at a production of the Lin-Manuel Miranda musical.
The controversy comes just days after comedian Kathy Griffin found themselves embroiled in scandal after posing for a photo holding the decapitated head of a fake Trump.
“Julius Caesar” previews began in May. The play officially opens Monday and runs through June 18 at the Delacorte Theater.

Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (the common name for Title V of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 which, in turn, was an amendment of the Communications Act of 1934) is one of the most important pieces of public policy for the internet.
Here's what it says: “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.”
What this means is that people who provide interactive computer services – that includes everything from sports discussion forums to blogs to Facebook – has a degree of immunity from liability for illegal content posted by users.
This is important. It would be legally prohibitive to run even a political blog with a comments section, let alone an enterprise the size of Twitter, without this immunity.
Which is why Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act – introduced by Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio and co-sponsored by North Dakota Senators John Hoeven and Heidi Heitkamp – is a threat to the internet.
While stopping sex trafficking is a noble goal, removing this immunity is the wrong way to go about achieving it. From my column
“ To be clear, people and companies who provide services on the internet absolutely should be liable for whatever illegal content or activities they're aware of. If Google, for example, knows that one of their services is being used to facilitate human trafficking or any other type of illegal activity and allows it to continue happening while taking no steps to stop it then the company should be liable. But should Facebook face criminal or civil liability because a prostitute arranges a transaction through the social networking site's messaging feature? Should Google face repercussions because someone used Gmail to solicit sex?
Proponents of this legislation will no doubt argue that law enforcement officials, and trial lawyers, are hardly interested in holding Facebook or Google responsible for what individuals get up to on their various services, but why should we have to rely on their forbearance? Why should we create even the possibility of this enormous, and grossly unfair, legal liability?
Web service operators who knowingly host or facilitate illegal content should be, and are under current law, liable for it. But outside of those circumstances, the liability for illegal activity ought to lay solely with those perpetrating it.
The Drums are back. Below, Noisey has the premiere of "Magic Mountain," the first new music from the band in three years—but don't worry, they're still The Drums you know and love. Of the song, vocalist Jonny Pierce says, "Not since the Summertime EP has it been just Jacob and I left up to our own devices. Now that we're back to just the two founding members, we figured we could do whatever we wanted and run with it. Together, we had just one goal: let go of any preconceived ideas that anyone has about The Drums and make songs to be as grand and majestic as we want them to be. "Magic Mountain" is a sparkling reflection of our last three years. It's about shedding off what binds you and protecting whats good, finding a safe place away from everyone and everything that wants to destroy you."
That all sounds very positive, so we're down to listen to this track while skipping down the sidewalk in the sunshine. We suggest you do the same, or do whatever you do that makes you happy, man. Stream it below, and catch the band on tour this coming fall.

That Was It: On Seeing the Strokes for the First Time
Drunk In Love with Sharon Van Etten
Athens must have come across like a ghost town to German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble during their visit to the Greek capital on Thursday. The city center was sealed off and protests were banned. There were considerable fears that riots might break out because of the hatred many Greek people harbor toward the finance minister. The leftist newspaper Avgi greeted their arrival with a well-known Latin slogan: "Ave, Schäuble, morituri te salutant" -- Hail, Schäuble, those who are about to die salute you. When state visitors in a united Europe are received in that fashion, something has clearly gone terribly wrong.
Athens gives Schäuble a good opportunity to view the rubble of the failed policies toward Greece of recent years. At the beginning of the crisis, experts with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted a short period of pain for the country. If it worked hard to achieve its austerity homework, the worst would soon pass, they said. Instead, the Greek economy has been in a state of recession for five years now, with no end in sight. Unemployment is at 27 percent. And the country's so-called rescuers would consider it a success if that figure were to climb just a little bit slower.
Of course there are no easy fixes for a crisis this deep -- nor is there a single culprit. The forces of inertia among Greece's political and administrative elite contributed a great deal to the current misery. But Schäuble has also played a rule by blocking possible paths out of the crisis for the country.
The issue now is a further debt haircut that would make it possible for the country to shed itself of a tremendous burden. During the current calendar year, Greece's mountain of debt will grow by around 330 billion ($432 billion). That's almost 180 percent of annual economic output. Few other countries in the world have liabilities that high -- at least none with the kind of weak economic structure Greece has. The interest payments the Greek state has to send abroad are making the recession even worse, which in turn is causing debt levels to rise. How is Greece ever going to get itself out of this vicious circle?
It's Time to Give Greece a Fair Chance
It already happened once, at the beginning of 2012, that private creditors forgave a part of Greece's debt. But it was already clear at the time that it wouldn't go far enough. In order to truly and sustainably help the country out, public creditors (e.g. the governments of countries like Germany) would also have to write off part of the money they lent to Greece. Currently, two-thirds of Greece's bonds are held by public creditors abroad.
Whether one wants to call that step a haircut, debt forgiveness or a state bankruptcy is of secondary importance -- the different designations only define the conditions under which the debt is trimmed. What is clear, though, is that Greece would be given a fair chance to grow its way out of the crisis on its own.
Of course, there is one hitch. The pain would no longer be felt exclusively by the Greeks -- it would also hit taxpayers in the rest of Europe, especially those in Germany. For the first time in the four years of the crisis, their pocketbooks would be hit massively -- because the money from the loans to Greece that are written off would then be missing somewhere else in government budgets.
That sounds rather uncomfortable. And as a taxpayer, one would certainly expect that their or their own government would attempt to prevent this scenario from becoming a reality. From the way things look now, though, there is no longer any way of preventing this. At this point, the worst cannot be prevented -- it can only be delayed by repeatedly providing Greece with new loans and leading the people to believe that the sums given will someday be paid back. If need be, they can also just extend the period on the loans to future generations of politicians.
That's precisely the approach being taken by Schäuble and Chancellor Angela Merkel. Federal elections in Germany take place on Monday, Sept. 22 -- and neither wants to negotiate under any circumstance any haircut or possible liabilities for Germany before that time. And after that? The finance minister will probably just waffle about.
They prefer to talk about a new aid program -- in other words, further billions in loans that will merely serve to increase Greece's debts and exacerbate the problem. And the burdens these loans will create for Germany? It's possible Schäuble won't be in office when they become a reality. The more honest way of handling this is to admit now what is really going to happen.
ISIS picked this fight once they started beheading people on your TV screen and nobody nowhere ever picked a fight they believed they could not win. And that's remarkable for what it reveals about ISIS command ideology.
They really believe they can win this war.
ISIS have taken a leaf from the 9/11 playbook. A lot of empty places and Iraq got carpet bombed in the wake of the twin towers coming down. But, let's face it, the terrorists won that war a long time ago. If the goal of 9/11 was to damage, degrade and destroy the freedom of Western democracy then 19 religious nuts pulled it off. We're a police state now. In the 1970s America you could get on a plane to Vegas just by rolling absently up to the check in counter and claiming you're the guy whose name was printed on the ticket. In 21st century America, your toddler's genitals get felt up by a government agent and the parents say yes sir, diddle my kid, this is acceptable because Oceania has always been at war with Eurasia and we need to be protected from the bad guys who fuel our cars. Let's face it, al-Qaeda won the war on terrorism a very long time ago.
ISIS, new kids on the block, believe they can top that because they're banking on the fact that we're that stupid.
One of the strengths of any guerrilla army throughout history knows when to stand your ground and when to run like fuck. ISIS will know how to run like fuck. They'll blend away once the rain of US and Euro JDAMs reach a crescendo. But their media wing won't. And that's why I've got serious reservations about 21st century warfare waged the way Western governments are waging it versus ISIS. If you're like me and have been hitting up LiveLeak all week to get some behind the scenes footage beneath the sanitized cool explosions Western news networks have been showing on TV, where the enemy dies clean and there is no unsightly limb separation or agonizing slow death under rubble, then I see an opening for the bad guys. This is where the ISIS media wing will gain some traction through social media. With a proper supply of dead baby footage, they stand a serious chance of enacting some counter narrative of their own.
Why?
Because air campaigns don't do shit v militias.
Never. Nowhere. Ever in time.
Air power is an awesome tool but nobody ever won a war from 20,000 feet.
Let's talk West Point 101. When you're at war, killing the enemy is always good. Killing the enemy while also killing civilians as collateral damage, while distasteful in the post war analysis (Hiroshima), is, by and large, acceptable (if you want to win). The interesting new paradigm at work here is what I hate to call the 'dead baby dynamic'. Since 21st century warfare has become a live popcorn munching event thanks to the Internet and 24hr TV news, parading casualties in front of news cameras has become a sort of counter propaganda and anti narrative that would've made Joseph Goebbels jizz their pants. For the defeated, if you can supply enough dead kid videos, there's a serious chance that you can convince a sizable segment of the enemy civilian population that war is bad.
Because humans are retarded by war.
But guess what... war is always bad
That's a given. And the truth is grim. Ask the average war protester what he'd do if an intruder broke into their house to steal all their shit and kill their wife and the likely answer is that they are going to freak. Your mild mannered protester will quickly resort to 'warfare' with that burglar and attempt to beat the living shit out of the intruder via the two by four which once boasted their protest sign that now suddenly comes in handy as a weapon while they swing away to break invader skull open. War, despite what Jesus might say, works as the enaction of a policy where you don't die but the guy breaking down your front door does. It's never pretty. Bear with me here, I know I'm stretching the metaphor but the ISIS threat they're advertising on TV is exactly this.... What do you do if there's a guy hanging out across the street openly telling the neighbors they want to kill your wife? They could be full of shit or they could be serious. Do you call the police? What happens when you are the police? America's self appointed role and Obama's tech heavy foreign policy is to run the numbers through the NSA's mega computer and the resultant actuary tables say that that asshole across the street needs to die. The risk of an ISIS dirty bomb in Times Square and the global wreckage that would ensue outweighs the right for ISIS to exist; so logic dictates letting loose the greatest advantage any war fighter anywhere ever had.
The US Air Force.
My problem is, can you win that war from the air?
Am I advocating for a ground invasion?
Nope. I'm just interested in how wars, once put into effect, get won.
Air strikes without boots on the ground never work if you're interested in defeating the enemy. What's bothering me about this campaign is the stated objectives. The West says they want to "degrade" ISIS. Surely this is the shitiest and most obscure objective ever enacted as policy. In many ways, war is very simple. You win or you lose. If you want to defeat ISIS you win by occupying the territory they do and leave them no space to run like fuck to. The West is selling this war thinking superior technology from the air can beat 'the idea of ISIS'. The only way you can beat the "idea of ISIS" is to kill every militia fighter hiding in a hole, or, crazy though it might seem, come up with a better idea. Each option is equally impossible so what do you do? Despite the laser guided, infrared and night vision tech getting advertised on our nightly news as a problem solver via destruction, at the very least you need, in order to 'win', a recon team on the ground designating by eyeball who should and shouldn't get killed. That kind of HUMINT shields you from the media explosion of accidentally wiping out a wedding party though it looked, to the pilot, exactly like a terrorist campfire from 20.000 feet.
And that's how we know there are already US boots on the ground in Syria and Iraq.
Western populations demand clinical war now that Wikileaks and Snowden are all over the government's ass. The war we get sold on TV demands precision lest the population back home on their iPhones throw a shit fit if a baby gets killed. Just imagine if WWII had been fought that way? We'd fuck lose every time a Nazi baby died. Proxy wars are hard to fight in a world where information spillage is everywhere, bullshit is rampant and death is as cheap as it ever was, but it does mean that today, more than ever, attack policy can go against foreign policy if governments don't get a serious grip on the narrative. ISIS is media whores operating in an environment where the threat of a dirty bomb in Time Square is nearly as good as actually detonating a real one.
Why?
Because social media penetration is a very profound thing that changes the dynamic of warfare in the 21st century from all that's come before. Napoleon would've cried tears of joy and held Moscow if he'd had a media wing broadcasting to the Russian population just exactly why they should speak French. The Internet is changing how wars get fought..
Let's get even more technical.
Drones.
When you're top dog on the global human hegemony heap like the US military is, conducting warfare while not subjecting your personnel to death is desirable. Obvious right? A functional given since Sun Tzu. Right now, the skies over Raqqa and other places in Syria and Iraq are filled with hardcore Western remote control technology. If you approach a HumVee in Syria or northern Iraq, a guy halfway around the world at their work station nods to their supervisor and minutes later, the vehicle and its environs get carpet bombed by a guy who pulled the trigger from the opposite side of the world.
The military call it suppression.The politicians call it 'degradation' and I call it war via call center and none of it means you win. It just provides a prescription for endless war. ISIS have done their homework and learned how to challenge civilization.
Let's face it, we're living in Blade Runner.
Victory will remain elusive for Western governments so long as your population demands safety. And who doesn't demand safety? ISIS doctrine is exploiting this and forcing Western governments to act in a bombing campaign that makes no sense. The world in 2014 is a boiling cauldron of seething rivalry between the great powers but, unlike 1914, nobody can make a big geopolitical move because nukes provide a cap on ambition where nobody can win, so proxy warfare, economic warfare and war via computer espionage have become king. None of the above will work against ISIS.
L et's state what we know for a fact.
Energy wars are complicated.
Any military action by any state actor in the Middle East is by default an energy war.
ISIS is formidable because the 'idea' behind ISIS recruits angry Sunni youth from many far flung places and that strikes fear into the heart of power elites in Sunni dictatorships like Saudi Arabia, Qatar and every other Arab state that chucked an F-16 into the recent attack. The Shia in southern Iraq are not afraid of ISIS because they can rely on Iran for support. Mosul has become expendable.
Meanwhile, the Kurds, wielding their own excellent militia and capitalizing on US air strikes, will hold Kirkuk, the oil producing gem that cannot be allowed to fall. Interestingly, the Turks, NATO members next door, have chosen to sit the whole thing out because it's getting dangerous for them a) because fellow Muslim foreign fighters are spilling over their borders into the war zone b) because the political situation in Turkey is tenuous and Erdoğan got elected by religious conservatives whose goals align with a fundamental idea of Islamic unity and c) because any help Turkey provides v ISIS makes an independent Kurdistan more likely. Remember, ISIS had 49 Turks held hostage a few weeks ago but guess what... they released all of them. Not a single beheading of any kind. Talk about knowing where your bread is buttered. ISIS atrocity is firmly directed against the West.
It's a clusterfuck of the first order and a very complicated war fighting environment.
Meanwhile, ISIS are loving it.
The only real question for Western policy is, where does victory against ISIS lie?
The only way to win is via occupation and who has got two million troops to spare to subjugate Sunni Arabia? The cost benefit analysis is exactly what ISIS are exploiting. That's why we get the current air campaign that amounts to a capitulation, Kony 2012 style, to popular opinion because beheading people on TV is making people rage and the public want action .
Every smart person alive today knows we're living in a kind of dystopia, the best of times, worst of times consumerist cornucopia that would make Orwell shit bricks. That's why I believe it's reasonable to stand back and resort to, and end on, a philosophical question regarding our species.
Warlike upright apes though we may be, we're still apes who managed a moon landing and currently have robots scouring Mars via remote control So the question must be why are we wasting our time with this shit? Should we not be directing our attention to a moon base, a human Mars landing and colonizing the galaxy?
I understand the current tactical fight for resources here on Earth, but how many ISIS fighters, and fighters on every side, are smart enough to realize the fundamental question that has been bothering humanity since Thucydides wrote their terrible account of self destruction in the 5th century BC. That question posed 25 hundred years ago remains terribly relevant in 2014.
'Why are we losing the war?'
Against ourselves.
So there's a US led war party in the desert and every Euro country with an F-16 to spare is piling in to the fray just so they don't miss their chance to get a swing in at the bad guys. Even Belgium rustled up a squadron. It's popcorn material for sure but it's also just an air offensive which means, for Western nations, you've just subjected yourself to never winning a war but continuing it indefinitely. Everyone with a TV or web connection already knows ISIS is the bad guys. Populations hate them. And the ISIS media wing loves this and drinks foreign civilian tears like it's freedom fuel. ISIS have been beheading people on video for a reason. They want attention. The interesting game at work here is the weight of military history working against the idea that air strikes ever won a war. Strategic bombing is nice WWII style but that only works when the enemy have factories to bomb. ISIS has none of that. They've got a loose social network, a hostage civilian population, some stolen Hum Vees and no production capacity of any kind. So where is the win here via JDAM?

Recently I was introduced to a new website in Brony.com. I'll be honest and tell you that it's the name of the website that caught my attention. The second thing that caught my eye is the awesome Rainbow Dash backpack that is exclusive to their website.
I was offered a chance to check out the backpack along with few other items and when the packages came, it felt like a Little Pony Christmas! The backpack isn't small and child-sized like I had first thought. It's a full-sized backpack and capable of carrying a regular pile of school supplies. The details make it stand out wherever you chose to wear it.
One of my friends remarked that Rainbow Dash's head looks like they are trying to eat my ear when I'm wearing it. The legs/arms, wings, mane, and tail are also fun details that really make this stand out amongst my other bags. I could easily see this as a travel buddy pillow with the right objects packed inside of it (PJs would be my first suggestion).
Another item was happy to try on was a Rainbow Dash bathrobe. The material is super soft and feels like heaven after a shower. I love that it's black and has neon colored thread for the details (eyes, wings, and cutie-mark). The head is also adorned with Rainbow Dash's main and is a soft towel-like fabric.
In addition to these fun items, the website also carries a range of t-shirts and accessories. My favorite shirt is a black one with Rainbow Dash (do you see a theme here yet?) that says “Simply Awesome” on it. It's not an adult sized shirt, but I was able to comfortably fit into a junior's large. The shirt goes well with the Rainbow Dash seatbelt belt.
Now for the fun part…thanks to Brony.com we are doing a Rainbow Dash giveaway!!

Store-bought ground beef often contains a variety of bacteria that can make humans sick and is resistant to the drugs used to treat it, according to new data from Consumer Reports.
While most bacteria in meat can be killed when cooked correctly, many Americans prefer to eat their meat rare, putting them at a greater risk for illness—especially when the meat comes from conventionally raised cows, which are treated with antibiotics and hormones, according to a new Consumer Reports study. The study found that nearly 20% of ground beef in the U.S. tested from conventionally raised cows had bacteria resistant to three or more classes of antibiotics. Only 9% of ground beef that was sustainably made had antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
For the report, Consumer Reports purchased and tested 300 packages of conventionally and sustainably produced ground beef sold in stores around the U.S. The meat was tested for five common types of bacteria that can be found in beef: Clostridium perfringens, E. coli, Enterococcus, Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus. Bacteria of some kind was found in all of the beef samples, though sustainably produced beef was less likely to have harmful strains.
More than 80% of conventional ground beef had two types of bacteria and nearly 20% of the samples contained C. perfringens, which causes close to a million cases of food poisoning every year. “There's no way to tell by looking at a package of meat or smelling it whether it has harmful bacteria or not,” Urvashi Rangan, executive director of the Center for Food Safety and Sustainability at Consumer Reports, said.“You have to be on guard every time.”
The research also found that 10% of the samples had a strain of S. aureus that produces a toxin that can make people ill and is not killed even when the meat is cooked properly. Still, cooking meat at 160 degrees Fahrenheit should kill most bacteria.
The findings suggest that consumers may want to look for ground beef that's sustainably produced, with labels reading “no antibiotics,” “grass-fed,” and “organic,” according to Consumer Reports. Consumer Reports says “grass-fed organic” may be one of the best labels to go by since it means the cattle eat organic grass and forage and do not receive antibiotics or hormones.
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement that the agency has put tight food safety standards in place over the last six years to avoid public health problems. “Measures taken to improve ground beef safety include a zero-tolerance policy for six dangerous strains of E. coli, better procedures for detecting the source of outbreaks, improved laboratory testing, and more. USDA's food safety inspectors work in every meat facility, every day, to reduce illnesses across all products we regulate, and we're proud to report that illnesses attributed to those items dropped by 10% from 2013 to 2014,” they said.

United Nations: India's gross domestic product (GDP) could rise to about $8 trillion over the next 15 years if the country registers a GDP growth rate of 8% annually and come very close to eliminating abject poverty entirely, NITI Aayog vice chairperson Arvind Panagariya has said.
They said with that the level of economic growth, living standards and amenities that are taken for granted in the west will become accessible to a very large part of the population in India in the coming 15 years. “Today, the Indian economy is among the major economies, the fastest growing economy, it has now left China behind. It grew in real dollars in the last 15 years ending 2016-17 (at) about 9%," Panagariya said at the United Nations.
“Once we correct for the exchange rate (changes), in real dollars India's growth rate in the last 15 years has been about 9 per cent," they said at an interactive multi-stakeholder panel hosted by India's Permanent Mission to the UN, the NITI Aayog and think-tank Research and Information System for Developing Countries on Monday.
Panagariya added that if one were to “make a very conservative assumption that over the coming 15 years, India would grow 8%, (the country's) gross domestic product (GDP) would rise from $2.3 trillion today to close to about $8 trillion", with an average income of over $5,000.
“At that level of income it is not simply that we will be very close to eliminating abject poverty entirely but a large part of the population will be very prosperous," they said, at the event titled Transforming India: Eradicating Poverty, Promoting Prosperity.
Participating in the panel along with Panagariya were Jagdish Bhagwati, Columbia University Professor and eminent economist; Hardeep Singh Puri, India's former permanent representative to the UN and chairperson of Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS); TCA Anant, chief statistician of India; and renowned actor Anupam Kher.
“I really think that as you go forward, there is a major transformation waiting to happen in the lives of about 1.3 billion-1.5 billion people by 2030. That will mean that much greater prosperity for the entire world," they said.
Panagariya noted that “unfortunately" from 2004 to 2014, reforms in the country came to a standstill. “Mistakes particularly during 2009 to 2014 actually ended up denting very badly India's growth process with the GDP growth rate declining from about 8.3% to about 6% during 2012-13 and 2013-14," they added.
The NITI Aayog chairperson said that currently the Indian economy is on a much more stable path. There are some of the “legacy issues" such as the non- performing assets of the banks and they are being tackled by the government, they said adding that inflation is down to below 2% and the government has systematically cut the fiscal deficits.
Listing the “big-item and big ticket reforms" such as the Goods and Services Tax (GST), Insolvency and Bankruptcy Act and the Aadhaar Act implemented by the government, Panagariya said the benefits of those reforms are just beginning to happen.
They termed the GST as a very hard fought reform that required not only a constitutional amendment but several legislations and approval of all 29 states of India. On sustainable development goals, Panagariya said India itself has had a major influence on the 17 ambitious global goals and “most of the SDGs mirror India's own national policies", including the Food Security Act, housing for all, Clean India campaign, National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, programme for the girl child.
Panagariya further said that it is “remarkable" that huge leadership for the SDGs is coming from the states in India and from the chief ministers. “The kind of leadership that has been provided in China by the city mayors is effectively now being provided by the state chief ministers in India," they said.
Addressing the session, Puri said that China has already lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and India too has done quite well recently. “But for the SDGs to succeed, India has to succeed. If India does not succeed in successfully implementing the SDGs, I am afraid the overall picture for the SDGs is not going to be a good one," Puri said, adding that it is extremely important that India has taken the task of implementing and achieving the SDGs “frontally and in a comprehensive way".
He, however, added that progress on education cannot be achieved without the focus on women and girls. “Gender equality and empowerment of women and girls is an imperative for the SDGs and also an imperative for India," Puri said.
Kher said India is making changes and progress across sectors and “if we don't see news channels and if we don't read newspapers, I discover that today we are really doing amazing things".
As individuals and citizens of the country, we need to know our responsibility towards the country. They pointed out that through movies such as the recent Akshay Kumar-starrer Toilet: Ek Prem Katha that talks about the problem of open defecation in villages, films are contributing in spreading awareness about crucial issues central to achieving the SDGs.
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter emerged upbeat from talks in Baghdad on Saturday about an unfolding offensive to retake the city of Mosul from Islamic State and said they were in discussions about future U.S. support once the city is recaptured.
The fall of Mosul, a city of 1.5 million people, would signal a pivotal defeat for the ultra-hardline Sunni jihadistsin Iraq but could also lead to land grabs and sectarian bloodletting.
Islamic State itself is also expected to morph into a more classic insurgency once it loses its final pockets of territory in Iraq.
Carter said they were encouraged by the campaign so far and was in discussions not just about potential future roles for U.S. troops after the fall of Mosul but also about the pressing need for humanitarian assistance and reconstruction.
“Now that isn't a defense mission or an Iraqi army mission, but it's a critical part of winning the peace,” Carter told reporters after talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.
“So even as we embark on this phase with Mosul ... we need to think about the future. And we are. And I did discuss that with the prime minister.”
The United Nations says Mosul could require the biggest humanitarian relief operation in the world, with worst-case scenario forecasts of up to a million people being uprooted.
Carter said the fight for Mosul was on track and on schedule, an assessment they added was shared by Baghdad.
The top U.S. commander in Iraq, Army Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend, said Taliban resistance had stiffened in recent days as the U.S.-backed Iraqi campaign advanced closer to the city of Mosul.
TOUGH FIGHTING
“It's pretty significant (resistance). We're talking enemy indirect fire ... even some anti-tank guided missiles. So it's been very tough fighting. Snipers. Machine guns,” Townsend said.
“The Iraqis expected this and they're fighting through it.”
Roughly 5,000 U.S. personnel are in Iraq. More than 100 of them are embedded with Iraqi and Kurdish Peshmerga forces involved with the Mosul offensive, advising commanders and helping ensure coalition air power hits the right targets.
Townsend disclosed that a total of about 500 coalition troops, including Americans, had gone “forward” on the battlefield - moving beyond the advancing forward line of troops that bears the brunt of the fighting.
“In an attack, the forward line of troops is a living, breathing, moving, thing.” they said.
In a reminder of the risks, U.S. Navy Chief Petty Officer Jason Finan was killed on Thursday by a roadside bomb in northern Iraq as they were accompanying Iraqi forces, in the first U.S. casualty of the Mosul campaign.
Carter said they met one of Finan's teammates in Baghdad, and learned more about the sailor's family.
“We need to understand … that there are Americans here that are in harm's way,” Carter said.
Speaking to a gathering of U.S. troops in Iraq, Carter said they were looking at potential future roles for U.S. forces after Mosul are recaptured, including counter-terrorism activities and more training Iraqi forces.
“As ISIL is progressively defeated in the major cities, they will take to a more of an insurgency type set of tactics. So we'll have a need to help the Iraqis to protect themselves, “should Iraq request support, they said, using an acronym for the group.
"Kehilot Israel Bamizrach Bameot Ha-19 Veha-20: Turkiya" ("Jewish Communities in the East in the 19th and 20th Centuries: Turkey" ), edited by Yaron Ben-Naeh, Ben Zvi Institute and the Education Ministry, 314 pages (in Hebrew )
The ship sent by Sultan Beyazid II to save the Jews and Arabs of Spain from the Inquisition in 1942.
Much false resentment and manipulation of hatred have been evident lately between Turkey - the country considered to be the "heir" of the Ottoman Empire - and the country that is considered to represent the Jewish people. The latter are actually the very same people over whom the Ottoman Empire spread its protective wings, time after time, in times of trouble: first in the period that followed the Spanish Inquisition, when Sultan Bayezid II opened the gates of their kingdom to a people that suddenly found itself without a homeland. And once again, during World War II, when Turkey turned a blind eye and allowed a steady stream of European survivors to pass through it en route to Palestine.
In other words, the friendship between the Turkish and Jewish nations is firm and longstanding, and that is not simply words but a historical fact. For those requiring proof, here is a comprehensive new book that is intended to introduce the reader to the history of Jewish life in Turkey during recent centuries, from a variety of perspectives.
The book's editor, Hebrew University historian Dr. Yaron Ben-Naeh, got a hole in one (in my view ) with a revolutionary article that they wrote about homosexual practices among Jews in the Ottoman Empire, in which they described the tolerance for such phenomena on the part of the community's rabbis - who ostensibly ought to have censured them vehemently.
Since then Ben-Naeh has enlightened us in other articles about other matters, and in a thick book about the Jews of the Ottoman Empire in the 17th century entitled, "Yehudim Bemamlechet Hasultanim" ("Jews in the Realm of the Sultan," Magnes Press, 2006 ). In it they describe the mutual social and religious relations between the Jews and their surroundings in a tolerant kingdom that allowed them to exist and develop within an autonomous framework that was always open to the outside world. Seclusion was never a hallmark of this Jewry.
In the 19th and 20th centuries, the period covered in the new book, Turkish Jewry was exposed, slowly at first, and then at an accelerated pace, to modernism, secularism, nationalism and to the innovative arts - from dance and theater to cinema. There was never any explosive or blood-soaked revolutions here: Turkey's Jews knew to keep their heads down when necessary, and during the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and founding of the republic, they also knew to bet on the right side. But in any event, one does not find extremism of any kind in the community's history, nor sharp transitions or overly fierce rebellions against tradition, but rather, mainly, evolutionary processes and slow change - and plenty of tolerance, from every direction, albeit not without arguments and fights.

Indeed, there were debates surrounding education - whether Turkish, French, Jewish, or any combination thereof. This is the subject of the chapter written by Yaron Ben-Naeh. There were also conflicts between Jewish newspapers over the issue of Zionism versus assimilation (the subject of a chapter by Moshe Maggid ). One fascinating chapter in the book deals with the Sabbatean believers, whose ancestors converted to Islam along with Shabtai Tzvi, and who to this day observe traditions of their own that are shrouded in mystery.
So multifaceted was Turkish Jewry, and so impossible to describe fully, that I can attest firsthand, for example, that the history of my own family - one whose roots in Istanbul go back for generations - does not actually correspond to any of the categories in the book. Was my family in fact "Eastern"? "Turkish"? It was certainly Jewish, but according to a rather broad and vague definition of Judaism. For example, I can just see my parents and grandparents guffawing were someone to say they were fond of Turkish-Jewish folk music, liturgy or poetry, a subject which musicologist Edwin Seroussi expounds on with tremendous erudition in the book. In fact, music, in their eyes, and in the eyes of all their relatives and members of their circle, meant solely Western classical music.
Ben-Naeh's book outlines general phenomena and historical models. It cannot and does not presume to take in individual nuances. Nevertheless, this is a heartwarming and informative work, which provides, on the margins of every page, concise information about people, phenomena and terms of import to anyone interested in the subject. For instance (completely at random, on page 67 ) there are a few lines about Rabbi Dr. David Marcus, the Ashkenazi rabbi of Istanbul, a liberal and enlightened man - and grandfather of the senior correspondent for Haaretz, Yoel Marcus.
Rare photographs, from family and public archives, give the book a nostalgic air, for what appears there is a world that is gone forever. It is safe to assume that Jewish homes no longer serve jam as a refreshment in a "tabela di dulsi," and many of the synagogues featured in the old photos are not active or no longer exist. But documentation still exists because Turkish Jewry was lucky to have one precious gift that not many other communities in the world had: continuous habitation from the late Middle Ages to this day, which was made possible due to Turkish society's tolerance toward the Jews, and to the Jews' efforts to avoid making themselves loathsome to their environment by annoying separatism.
These days, however, the coexistence described in the book before us is under threat. But better days are still to come, and we shall yet exchange with each other the almond candies that we Jews call "confetti di disposario."
In "Confessions of a Hillary Insider," Larry Johnson of No Quarter said that they are "shocked at the audacity of Hillary Clinton to decry Donald Trump as a birther because their campaign not only pushed that item in a bid to discredit Barack Obama, but mounted a sustained campaign attack Obama on a broad array of issues."
How do I know? I was part of that effort and was in regular email and phone coordination with Sidney Blumenthal. Sidney was the conduit who fed damaging material to me that I subsequently posted on my blog. In some cases Sid Blumenthal actually provided a draft piece that I would slightly modify and publish under my name. Most of the time, however, Sid provided background information and researched material that I would use to craft pieces. How many? I am providing the links to 63 blog articles that I posted (and in one case was posted by Susan Hudgens, who assisted with the blog) between January 2008 and June 30, 2008. Here is simple summary of material (in writing or through a verbal briefing) that I received from Sid?
Information surrounding the corrupt business relationship between Barack Obama and Tony Rezko. Information about Barack Obama's ties to Palestinian radicals. Information concerning Barack Obama's longstanding ties to the American terrorist, Bill Ayers. Information concerning Barack Obama's close ties to radical clerics–i.e., Jeremiah Wright and Father Michael Pfleger. Information concerning allegations that Barack Obama was not a natural born citizen. Information concerning Barack Obama being adopted by Indonesian Muslim Lolo Soetoro.
The big Kahuna of the anti-Obama dump was the allegation that Republicans had a tape of Michelle Obama in which they used the disparaging term “Whitey.” I published that after being told about the “tape” by Sid Blumenthal. (I learned a few weeks later that the story of the tape actually originated with Media Matter's David Brock and they confirmed its existence to me in person).
Johnson continues:
Listening to Hillary Clinton cry crocodile tears over Trump's questioning Obama's birthplace and eligibility to be President in 2011 as a “racist” attack is the ultimate example that Hillary is cynical and dishonest. Yes, it is true that the words, “Obama is a muslim” or “Obama is not a natural born American” never passed their lips. But it is also true that that people very close to her, such as Sidney Blumenthal, were pushing those stories and trying desperately to promote those memes. Hillary knew about all of these lines of attack on Obama. In fact I was told by Sid on one occasion in the summer of 2008 that the Big Dog (Bill of course) was very pleased with the pieces going up at NoQuarterUSA and thought they were helping Hillary.
Blumenthal denies it all, of course:
Whom to believe? The two journos who are finally willing after eight years to speak out about this, or Sid Blumenthal, David (Bouffant) Brock, and of course Jon Favreau, who is still splitting a gut over the "you can keep your plan" Obamacare lie?
One woman who took part in the march on Sunday, Meng Phang, 59, shouted to onlookers, including stone-faced police officers, that “Hun Sen and their family are getting richer, but everyone else is getting poorer.”
Ms. Meng Phang's participation also represented another crucial factor of the protests: the sustained financing of the movement. Ms. Meng Phang said they had donated about $1,000 to the protest movement from money they had saved while working in a factory in Japan.
Kem Sokha, one of the protest leaders, singled out contributions “from our people abroad” in a speech to protesters on Sunday evening. There are large Cambodian populations in Australia, France and the United States, among other countries.
The grievances among protesters on Sunday were varied. Sok Heng, a middle-aged carpenter, lamented the lack of justice in the country and mentioned the case of their brother-in-law, who they said was killed by a thief. The police asked for a bribe before agreeing to arrest the suspect, they said.
Touch Vandeth, 24, was one of thousands of garment workers on strike who demanded a doubling of the minimum wage to $160 a month, a sharp increase that would put wages well above those of Cambodia's regional economic competitors, including Bangladesh, Myanmar and Vietnam. Ms. Touch Vandeth, who assembles Adidas footwear at a factory on the outskirts of Phnom Penh, said they had been unable to save much money on their current salary, $80 plus overtime.
Chay Soheaktra, one of the many Buddhist monks taking part in the demonstration, said they were angry that Mr. Hun Sen's government had given a forestry concession to a Vietnamese company. Anti-Vietnamese talk has been a mainstay of the protest leaders, who portray Mr. Hun Sen as a puppet of Vietnam. (Mr. Hun Sen is Cambodian but came to power with the aid of an invading Vietnamese Army that pushed the Khmer Rouge from power in 1979.)
The Buddhist hierarchy is closely aligned with Mr. Hun Sen, but younger monks have joined the protests — sometimes in defiance of their elders — and are particularly angry at the theft this month of precious Buddhist relics from a Buddhist shrine. Monks question how a national treasure was so poorly guarded, especially when hundreds of security officers guard the residences of Mr. Hun Sen and other top officials.
Branislav Ivanovic is sticking around at Stamford Bridge
Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic has agreed a year's extension to their contract with the option of another year, according to Sky sources.
Ivanovic's previous deal at Stamford Bridge was set to expire at the end of the season, but their new contract ties them to the club at least until the summer of 2017.
Chelsea has the option to extend their contract for a further year, which would take Ivanovic's stay with the Blues into its 10th year.
Widespread newspaper reports had previously linked the 31-year-old with a move away from Chelsea, with Inter Milan and AC Milan reportedly among the clubs interested in signing him.
Ivanovic joined Chelsea from Lokomotiv Moscow in January 2008 and has since made 341 appearances for the club, scoring 32 times.
The Serbia international has won two Premier League titles, four FA Cups, the Capital One Cup, the Europa League and the Champions League during their eight years with Chelsea.
About 850 workers at San Francisco's largest hotel made good on their strike vote last month and walked off the job today in a six-day protest of what they say are unfair contract proposals by management.
The Hilton Union Square workers are among about 9,000 San Francisco hotel employees who have been without new contracts since August 2009.
The Hilton workers approved a temporary strike on Sept. 15.
Housekeepers, doormen, bellhops, and kitchen and front desk staff will be honoring the strike and picketing outside the hotel 24 hours a day until 4 a.m. Tuesday, union spokesperson Riddhi Mehta-Neugebauer said.
The union alleges that proposals by hotel management would “lock workers into permanent recessionary contracts.”
The union is opposing proposed increases in employee health care contributions, the freezing of pensions, reduced staffing and greater workloads.
Hotel management said in a statement today that the average pay for a housekeeper is $60,000, while some bartenders and banquet workers make more than $100,000, and all employee health care costs are fully paid by the hotels.
Hilton General Manager Michael Dunne said the 1,902-room hotel “is operating normally and is fully operational,” using management and temporary replacement workers in place of the striking workers “with little or no disruption to guest services.”
Mehta-Neugebauer was skeptical that the full workload was being picked up.
“I don't know if they got 850 temporary replacement workers and management to do the job,” they said.
Patricia Breslin, executive director of the Hotel Council of San Francisco, released a statement calling the strike “a self-inflicted wound by the union to its members and the city.”
“The hotels are struggling, the city is struggling, working people are struggling, and anything that hurts the economy is bad for all of us,” Breslin said.
But union officials claim the Hilton chain has received millions in corporate tax breaks, and that the hotel industry in general has been rebounding from the economic downturn.
“So why are we helping these corporations, when they don't even need it, technically?” Mehta asked.

On September 22, 1981, 13-year-old Heather Porter went missing from their Halethorpe home; the next day, a man walking their dog found their body. No one was ever charged with their murder, but Towson police are trying to bring fresh attention to the case, in hopes that new details might emerge.
While decades-old murders are incredibly difficult to solve–evidence is often missing or destroyed; people's memories have grown fuzzy–the internet has proven to be a useful tool for police and others who are preoccupied with cold cases. Networks of online sleuths comb over old documents and occasionally make connections and answer questions. Circulating images or information online might jog someone's memory or reveal an important clue.
Baltimore County police have recently enlisted the public's help for another cold case: the 1996 murder of Towson student Joann “Jody” LeCournu, who was shot in the back of their head in the parking lot of the Drumcastle Shopping Center. For that case, police have released crime scene photos that have never before been made public, in hopes that they'll help reveal information that might lead to an arrest. Read more about LeCournu's case here.
Amit Shah has said they want the BJP-led coalition in power in the North East by 2018
As BJP chief Amit Shah on Tuesday unveiled their target to expand the footprint of the north-eastern coalition led by the BJP across the region, a top BJP leader at the same meeting reassured leaders from North Eastern states that the party did not intend to dictate what people should eat. The assurance comes just a day after the NDA government's new tourism minister KJ Alphons called eating beef a matter of choice for Keralites.NDTV has learnt that concern about the BJP's hard line on cow slaughter had come up at the closed-door meeting of the North-East Democratic Alliance, or NEDA, a coalition formed by the BJP last year with regional political parties from the region. At Tuesday's meeting, BJP president Amit Shah had made it clear that they wanted to see the coalition in power in the region's eight states.It was during a presentation by Sikkim leaders that the topic came. Sikkim has become the first state in the North East to ban all kinds of cow slaughter with a punishment of minimum two years imprisonment. The delegation from the state where the BJP is part of the ruling alliance Sikkim Democratic Front mentioned the law.This is when Meghalaya leaders Paul Lyngdoh and MP Conrad Sangma asked for a clarification. They wanted to know if the ban on beef was a matter of policy. Meghalaya is one of the four states in the North Eastern to go to polls within the next year apart from Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura. In June, some BJP leaders had also exited the party in Meghalaya blaming the party for not respecting local customs and food habits.At Tuesday's meeting, NDTV has learnt Himanta Biswa Sarma, a senior BJP leader and NDA convenor, intervened when the question about food habits came up in the presence of BJP president Amit Shah. Mr Sarma is learnt to have told the gathering that the BJP did not want to interfere with the food habit or local customs of people.He also went on to say that every state was at liberty to draft laws according to local customs and rituals."The party completely respects cultural diversity," they were reportedly told. While Amit Shah did not speak on the subject, they apparently went along with that. In the past when junior home minister Kiren Rijiju who is from Arunachal Pradesh reportedly ticked off a ministerial colleague about their right to eat beef, they had backtracked later, claiming that they were misquoted. Mr Rijiju's remarks were then in response to Minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi's statement that those who eat beef should go to Pakistan.

In an egregious violation of Department of Defense policy, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel has recorded an ad critical of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton while appearing to wear a flight suit complete with unit patches and rank insignia. Wendy Rogers is a three-time Republican Congressional candidate in Arizona, and they most recently lost the GOP primary in the state's 1st Congressional District in August. Rogers is also a retired Air Force pilot who was one of the first female pilots in the service.
“As a pilot in the United States Air Force, I was entrusted with classified information. We were always taught that you don't send or receive classified information through unsecured channels,” Rogers says before going on to criticize Hillary Clinton for using a private, unsecured e-mail server to send and receive classified information.
Rogers was also taught that you can't mix your uniform and politics.
A Department of Defense prohibition on wearing one's military uniform while communicating a partisan political message is still very much in effect. A 2008 directive from the DOD explicitly outlines what is allowed and not allowed when it comes to political activity by active duty, reserve component and retired military personnel.
“Subject to any other restrictions in law, a member of the Armed Forces not on active duty may
[engage in political activity] provided the member is not in uniform and does not otherwise act in a manner that could reasonably give rise to the inference or appearance of official sponsorship, approval, or endorsement,” DOD Directive 1344.10 reads.
The ad Rogers appears in is sponsored by Veterans for a Strong America, a group that has raised about $87,713 according to the Federal Election Commission. While the ad does not explicitly tell viewers who to vote for or against, the message certainly allows viewers to make the “inference,” to barrow from the DOD directive, that they – like Lt. Col. Rogers – should not vote for Clinton.
Rogers could try to skirt the issue of wearing their uniform by claiming that they are a retiree. But the DOD directive also includes guidance for those who have left military service. Paragraph 4.3.1.1 explains that while it is okay for former service members to mention their rank and service, “they must clearly indicate their retired or reserve status.”
Nothing on Rogers' uniform indicates their retired status, nor does the scroll at the bottom of the screen disclose that they are retired. Them rank insignia appear on their uniform, and they identify themselves as ” Lt. Col. Wendy Rogers” without mentioning that they are retired.
Candidates and other public figures who are veterans may mention their current or previous military rank and service, and may include video clips or pictures of themselves in uniform, as long as they do not appear in uniform while talking in the ad, and as long as they identify that they are retired (if that is the case). They must also include a disclaimer that pictures or videos used do not constitute an endorsement by the Department of Defense. Rogers did include that mandatory disclaimer, but that still doesn't authorize them to actually wear what appears to be a uniform while delivering a partisan or explicitly political message on camera.
In social media posts and on their campaign website, Rogers appears to pose with their Air Force jacket while wearing civilian clothes. They could try to say that they were wearing civilian clothes that couldn't be seen in the ad, but if they aren't in uniform at all, they wouldn't have had to include the disclaimer (which still doesn't justify them actions).
By abusing their military rank and uniform, Rogers is helping fuel the call by some that senior military leaders always avoid partisan politics once they leave military service. That would be both a bad idea, and a violation of a long-standing American tradition of military leaders participating in politics and public policy once they have left uniformed service. But when military leaders like Rogers violate the trust of their oath by appearing in uniform to make partisan statements, they do threaten the civil-military relationship that respects the power of voters to elect civilian leaders who oversee the nation's military.

Pardon me, Toronto, but your sushi manners are atrocious. Servers cringe when you unwrap your chopsticks and rub them together vigorously like some demented carpenter with a splinter phobia. Chefs weep when you pick up delicately seasoned bundles of nigiri with chopsticks and dip them rice-side down into an overflowing dish of soy sauce, the colour of which approximates the Don River owing to runoff from vast amounts of wasabi.
Chef Keiichi Masuda, who has been making sushi for decades, is on something of a mission. They want to teach people to avoid some of the more common -- and tasteless -- mistakes. They spoke with the Star's Kim Honey. (March 18, 2009) ( BRIAN HUGHES / TORONTO STAR )
It's not your fault. The finer points of sushi etiquette are largely unknown outside Japan. Add to that the fact that there are only 30 or 40 Japanese-trained sushi chefs in the city's estimated 700 sushi joints, and you begin to grasp the magnitude of the problem. Chances are the sushi you've been eating isn't even authentic sushi, particularly if it contains any of the following: avocado, cream cheese, mayonnaise or deep-fried anything. "Nobody cares about it," says Keiichi Masuda, owner and chef at Mikado restaurant on Laird Dr. in Leaside, which they opened 31 years ago. "Only sushi chefs care." About five years ago, they gently suggested to a sushi-bar customer that they shouldn't dip the nigiri into the soy rice-side down, and that they were using too much sauce.
Article Continued Below
"She got mad and never came back," says the chef, who serves sea urchin, octopus, squid, barbecued eel, monkfish liver and salmon that they smoke themselves over imported Japanese cherrywood. "That's why I made the sign." The one-page handouts on sushi etiquette are scattered about the restaurant and inserted inside each menu. Last week, they gave them to kimono-clad beauties to hand out at the Japanese food booth at the Canadian Food and Beverage Show at the Exhibition grounds. Masuda, a vice-president of the Japanese Restaurant Association of Canada, is polite to the extreme, and suggests their poor English was part of the problem. "I don't want to push too many Japanese customs," says Masuda. "The main thing is, the customer enjoys my food." In our condiment-crazy culture, where food is a canvas to be built upon, adding a puddle of ketchup or a dollop of hot sauce is the norm. But adding wasabi to the special preparation of soy sauce made by sushi chefs to complement their nigiri is the same thing as adding salt and pepper to a three-star chef's food without tasting it first.
The North American palate, which craves salt and has become more accustomed to spicy food, conspires to ruin the sushi experience, particularly when it comes to eating nigiri: small, hand-shaped rectangular blocks of seasoned rice topped with raw fish. The absolute biggest no-no for nigiri is dipping it rice-first into the soy sauce. That's because the rice has already been perfumed with a mixture of rice wine vinegar, sugar, salt, a cooking wine called mirin and kombu or seaweed. The chef wants you to be able to taste all that. The sushi chef has also packed the rice by hand so that it falls apart when it hits your mouth. If you dunk it in soy, some stays behind in the dish and makes a soupy mess.
Article Continued Below
The second biggest insult is to add wasabi to the soy, since the chef has already placed what they deem to be the correct amount for the fish, fatty or lean, on top of the rice. In some places like Mikado and Hiro Sushi on King St. E., the chef will have made their own soy-based sauce for the nigiri, infusing it with tamari, mirin and bonito flakes. You can usually tell if this is the case, because it will be served in small ceramic jugs. You are meant to pick the nigiri up with your fingers, turn it upside down, gently pass the fish through the sauce and place it on your tongue fish-side down. Assuming it's not jumbo-sized, eat it all in one bite. "The rice is not too sticky so it will break and the aroma comes to the nose, and the wasabi hits the tongue and the soy sauce counteracts the fish smell," explains Hiro Yoshida, owner and chef of Hiro Sushi, who is also a vice-president of the Japanese Restaurant Association of Canada. "It's like creating one world inside your mouth." The rules change for maki and sashimi, which are eaten with chopsticks. It's even okay to mix wasabi into the soy sauce. But never, ever eat pickled ginger on top of your sushi. It's a palate cleanser to be eaten in between different kinds of fish. Jazz singer-songwriter Robyn Hayle stopped by Mikado last week to indulge in their weakness for raw fish. The Toronto resident has been eating sushi for more than 20 years and considers themselves an expert. They stopped eat futomaki, the big vegetarian roll that features omelette and vegetables, because it's "too plebeian." They know not to eat pickled ginger with sushi, and loves some of the fish Canadians avoid, but didn't know they should dip the nigiri fish-side down into the soy sauce, or that the soy was specially prepared for nigiri. The next time they ate sushi, they tried it. "I had a much better experience," they report. "The rice didn't fall apart in the dish." Among Japanese chefs, some of whom apprentice for as many as 10 years before they are deemed educated enough to open their own restaurant, customers who know the etiquette and are not turned off by, say, barbecued eel, are called sushi tsu, or connoisseurs. "There are a lot of customers in this restaurant who are sushi tsu," says Yoshida. " My clients, the Canadians, are much better than Japanese people because I educated them." Table manners have always been man's way of imposing order on their chaotic world, part of the drive to be civilized, to put some distance between apes and Homo sapiens. The rules are sometimes arcane to the max in any culture. Who knows why some of us were taught to switch our fork from right to left hand in order to cut our meat? In the same way, some of the Japanese rules are rooted in ancient customs. So the samurai don't put more than the first inch of the chopsticks into their mouths. Japanese chefs are not arguing that you should, too. Like any chef, they just want you to appreciate their food. And like the French chef who shrinks in horror from a customer who asks for ketchup for their steak frites, sushi chefs know you would enjoy their food much more if you laid off the soy sauce and wasabi. Please. Arigato gozaimasu. (Thank you very much.)
Confirmation of Marco Reus' extended contract at Borussia Dortmund ended months of intense debate over where the German would play their football next season. Now, Reus is setting their sights on winning the Bundesliga with their hometown club.
"That remains a major goal for me," the attacking-midfielder says in Monday's edition of the German magazine kicker. "I want to experience once more what happened in the city then.
"I will give everything for that, and I have a strong feeling that it can happen one day."
Dortmund won back-to-back championships in 2011 and 2012 before Reus arrived at the club in the summer of 2012. They cost the Ruhr giants over 17 million euros ($19.9 million) following a scintillating season with Borussia Mönchengladbach.
While Robert Lewandowski and Mario Götze have since been lured to Munich by the current German champions, Reus' new deal until 2019 - which also extends to the second division should Dortmund be relegated - is worth purportedly 10 million euros per year and represents another milestone for the club.
Real Madrid and Bayern were reportedly among the interested clubs had Reus chosen to use a buy-out clause on their previous Dortmund contract which could have been executed for around 25 million euros, according to comments from Bayern's CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge.
Throughout the uncertainty, Reus refused to comment - and they afforded praise to their current employers for their "business-like" attitude to securing them on a long-term deal all through the club's problems on the park late last year.
"Here, nobody is wandering around and has made statements which point in the wrong direction. The calmness which has emanated inside and outside at Dortmund during the crisis, shows the strength of the club."
"I made this decision because Borussia is best for me. Dortmund is my home town, my family lives here and I have my friends here."
"And by the way, there's still life after football," they added.

There are times in Flinthook when I enter a zen-like state, effortlessly swinging across the room, with my gut determining where I should head next. It plays into my favorite part of platforming, a sense of motion derived from exploring a space. I felt that way recently, and it lasted until I found myself unexpectedly trapped in a room full of spikes—a literal difficulty spike—promptly died, and found myself losing a full hour of progress. The best roguelikes make death a teachable moment, a lesson to note when charging back into the breach. In Flinthook, I mostly feel exhaustion, knowing it'll be a while until I get that far again.
Flinthook, the latest from the nostalgic pixel pushers at Tribute Games, is deeply satisfying to play precisely because it's a pleasure to control. When you can find enjoyment in swinging around a room, rather than attacking enemies or making meaningful progress, that's a notable achievement. And as has become a welcomed tradition with Tribute Games, Flinthook is gorgeous to look at, magically capturing the SNES-but-better aesthetic they've been playing with since the studio's overlooked debut, Wizorb, and its Contra-inspired Mercenary Kings.
The basic structure of Flinthook is familiar—fight through a few levels, beat a boss—but in the same way Mercenary Kings took inspiration from games like Monster Hunter, Flinthook mashes up its classic aesthetic with something more contemporary: roguelikes. The closest relative to Flinthook is one of my favorites of the last few years, Rogue Legacy, in which players are forced to start from scratch after dying, but with the chance to buy upgrades and perks that might make the next run more successful. Unlike Spelunky, Flinthook doesn't send you all the way back. Once you've finished a boss, you can move onto the next one.
Some roguelikes are about progression in the traditional sense, where you want to see the next area, the next boss, and eventually beat the game. Some roguelikes are about the story of that run, with new areas, enemies, and visual trappings acting as a new storytelling devices. It's why I can tell you about specific runs during my 100 hours with Spelunky, like the time I meant to hit the jump button to leave the shopkeeper's room, but accidentally dropped a bomb, triggering them to attack me, and ending an otherwise successful run. In a sense, it was successful; years later, I'm still able to tell you about what happened.
Flinthook, however, is more about traditional progress, and that's where me and Flinthook have been having problems. I'm currently on the game's fourth boss, but reaching their arena takes roughly an hour of play. Twice, I've made it to their doorstep hobbled and with little health. That'd be one thing if I had a bold strategy for how to take them out, but instead, I'm still learning how the boss' mechanics work, and by the time I've made any headway, I've died and it's back to square one. I now have to fight another hour to put those ideas into practice, and that's assuming I don't run into one of those nasty trap rooms I outlined above.
All images courtesy of Tribute Games
It'd be easier if I could regale you with stories of my many failures on that journey, but Flinthook's rooms are often a blur. Moment-to-moment, I'm having a good time, and I'm never going to tire of swinging around, but the grind takes its toll. It doesn't help the game have a limited number of enemies and visual styles. I'm at the point where my character is upgraded in a way that makes me balanced and effective, and given how many Souls games I've played over the years, I've got no problem with having to sprint through a level for another shot at a boss, but Flinthook's balance gets out of whack as it goes along.
Bosses can't be fought until you collect enough tokens to reveal their location. Each level unlocks a token, and more tokens are required as you progress. I'd love an opportunity to take on a tougher level and gamble my skills on an opportunity to get more—or all—of the tokens necessary to take on the boss again.
If I'm being honest, in my heart of hearts, I wish Flinthook was structured differently. I wish these mechanics and visuals were dropped into handmade levels, Mega Man-style. Maybe that's part of why I'm bouncing off of it. There's so much about Flinthook that is everything I enjoy about games. It sucks to not love it more.

Seongnam city is considering implementing a ‘Youth Dividend', based on the idea of a basic income. If it happens, it will be the first case in Korea.
The city（성남시 城南市）is located about 20 km south from the centre of Seoul, and has a population of around 980,000 in its 142 square kilometers of land.
The mayor, Lee Jae-myeong (이재명) has been keen for poverty reduction. With their initiative, the city considers an introduction of a ‘Youth Dividend'. Although the idea is inspired by a universal and unconditional basic income, the detail of a ‘Youth Dividend' is not decided yet. The city commissioned to an external agency for research on feasibility of implementation of it last June.
*This news is written based on the following news and information from some Korean Friends including Smila Youhyung Park (스밀라): http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2015/06/19/0200000000AKR20150619178800061.HTML

(Part 1 in a series on Evangelical Christianity in America)
There is much confusion about Evangelical Christianity in America, including very basic questions such as: What is it? Who is Evangelical Christians? What do they believe? How is it changing? And so forth.
So, I thought that I would start a series, guaranteed to run as long as I feel like writing about it, that simply describes the basics of Evangelical Christianity in modern-day America.
Let's start with perhaps the most basic of questions: What is Evangelical Christianity?
There is no one answer to even this the most simple of questions, though there are fundamental characteristics associated with it.
Historian David Bebbington defines Evangelical Christianity as having four main qualities (quoted from here):
* Biblicism, a particular regard for the Bible (e.g. all essential spiritual truth is to be found in its pages)
* Crucicentrism, a focus on the atoning work of Christ on the cross
* Conversionism, the belief that human beings need to be converted
* Activism, the belief that the gospel needs to be expressed in effort
Theologian John Stackhouse has a nice discussion of the theological aspects of the term here.
Sociologist Brian Steensland and colleagues point to these characteristics: “Evangelical denominations have typically sought more separation from the broader culture, emphasized missionary activity and individual conversion, and taught strict adherence to particular religious doctrines.”
As commonly used, Evangelical Christianity refers to Protestants only, and I will follow that convention, though there's no reason that the general definition of Evangelicalism can't apply to Catholics as well. In fact, Pope Francis has been labeled an “Evangelical Catholic.”
Here is where things get tricky: How do we measure Evangelical Christianity? That is, how do we know who is one and who isn't one?
The most commonly-used approach is scholarly research is to look at religious affiliation and define Evangelical Christianity at a denominational level. So, people who go to “Evangelical” Protestant denominations are themselves Evangelicals. But… there are different approaches to doing this.
One affiliation-based approach, developed by Steensland et al., divides Protestants into three traditions: Evangelical, Mainline, and Historically Black. Evangelicals tend to be more conservative both socially and theologically, Mainline tend to be more liberal on both, and Historically Black tend to be theologically conservative and socially liberal.
A second popular affiliation-based approach, however, refers to “conservative” protestants and contrasts them with “moderate” and “liberal” protestants. Conservative protestants and then broken into different groups, including evangelicals, fundamentalists, and charismatics.
The term “conservative protestant” in the second approach is roughly equivalent to “evangelical” in the first approach.
Which is the better approach? I tend to use the first approach since its measurement characteristics are reasonably well supported in empirical studies; however, both approaches have their problems. With the first approach, many of the people defined as Evangelical don't identify with that term themselves (a point I'll return to below). With the second approach, many conservative protestants are conservative in theology but liberal in politics and social issues, so painting them with the broad brush of conservatism overstates matters.
To complicate matters further, journalists and other people in public discourse (and even some scholars) use a variety of terms as synonymous with evangelical/conservative protestant, including “fundamentalist,” “born-again,” and “religious right.” Others, however, give each of these terms more precise meaning.
As a second general approach, some scholars focus on identity. To them, Evangelical Christians are people who say they are Evangelical Christians.
With other religious traditions, affiliation and identity measures yield about the same results. For example, people in the Catholic church usually think of themselves as Catholics. However, as discussed above, many people involved in Evangelical churches identify with other labels, such as “born-again Christian” or “non-denominational Christian.”
Conceptually, identity and affiliation are two different matters. For example, I live in New England (Connecticut's state motto: “We're between New York and Boston), but I don't identify myself as a New Englander–still a Californian. So, at some level, whether we look at identity or affiliation depends on which aspect of the religious experience we're interested in.
As a third general approach, a well-known marketing firm–The Barna Group–uses theological questions to identify Evangelical Christians. They start with two theology questions to identify born-again Christians. Then, among born-again Christians, they use seven more theology questions to identify Evangelical Christians. For example, one of the seven questions regards “believing that Jesus Christ lived a sinless life on earth.”
I don't know of any scholars who use this 9-question theology test to define evangelicals, and it strikes me as convoluted and of unknown measurement qualities.
The different uses of the term Evangelical lead to all sorts of confusion. For example, using affiliation-based definition, about 25% of Americans are Evangelical Christians. But, using identity- or theology-based definitions, the number drops to 8%-15%.
What does all of this mean for the person wanting to learn about Evangelical Christianity? Basically, in reading any information about Evangelical Christianity, you, the reader, have to first assess how the author is using the term. It means more work for you, but it's necessary for understanding what's going on.
Enough confusing terminology! My upcoming posts will have cool graphs and numbers that demonstrate how Evangelical Christianity (as defined in the first affiliation-based approach) is doing.
(P.S., we bloggers are told that we need to add pictures to enhance our posts. But, I have no idea of how to visually illustrate an operational definition, so I just added a picture of a cute kitten).
Republicans stepped up their calls Thursday for Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch to recuse themselves and appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton after Ms. Lynch admitted to meeting earlier this week with former President Clinton at the Phoenix airport.
Ms. Lynch has insisted the meeting was impromptu and touched on personal issues, not the FBI's criminal investigation into Mrs. Clinton's email practices at the State Department. And Democrats rushed to defend Ms. Lynch, saying that despite the unforced error, they are capable of overseeing the investigation.
But Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, said Ms. Lynch needs to remove themselves from oversight.
“This incident does nothing to instill confidence in the American people that their department can fully and fairly conduct this investigation, and that's why a special counsel is needed now more than ever,” the Texas Republican said.
Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump questioned the judgment of both Ms. Lynch and Mr. Clinton, who is the husband of Mr. Trump's likely opponent in the November election.
“You know, I've been talking about the rigged system — how it's rigged,” Mr. Trump said on “The Mike Gallagher Show.” “And this is terrible, and nobody can understand why nothing's happened. And you see a thing like this, and even in terms of judgment, how bad a judgment is it for them or for them to do this?”
Mrs. Clinton has said they made a bad choice in using a secret email account tied to a server they kept at their home in New York, which effectively shielded their emails from public view for nearly six years. Hundreds of those messages have since been deemed classified, and authorities are probing the arrangement.
The FBI has said it won't be rushed to judgment in the investigation, but President Obama has faced criticism for saying they didn't think Mrs. Clinton jeopardized America's national security. Mr. Obama has also endorsed Mrs. Clinton, raising questions about whether that would skew the investigation.
Ms. Lynch's meeting with Mr. Clinton added fuel to complaints that the attorney general has at the very least created the appearance of a conflict of interest in the event that the FBI recommends a criminal prosecution for Mrs. Clinton but the Justice Department decides not to pursue the case.
Judicial Watch, a conservative legal group that has worked to secure the release of records tied to Mrs. Clinton's email set-up, said on Thursday that the Justice Department's inspector general should investigate the meeting.
“Attorney General Loretta Lynch's meeting with Bill Clinton severely undermined the already low public confidence in their agency's criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.
The White House deflected questions on the propriety of the meeting but said Ms. Lynch understands the importance of an independent Justice Department.
“The president's view is that this is an investigation that should be conducted free of any sort [of] political interference,” said White House press secretary Josh Earnest. “And the attorney general has indicated that that's exactly their expectation as well.”
Ms. Lynch said the conversation with Mr. Clinton was primarily social, and that the former president came over and talked about their grandchildren and their travel.
“So that was the extent of that, and no discussions were held [on] any cases or anything of that [nature]. And they didn't raise anything about that either,” Ms. Lynch told reporters.
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, said on Thursday that they can't control who meets with whom but that Ms. Lynch's ethics are “above reproach.”
Sen. Christopher A. Coons, Delaware Democrat, likewise defended Ms. Lynch, but said in an appearance on CNN that their meeting with Mr. Clinton sends the wrong message.
“I think they should have steered clear, even of a brief, casual social meeting with the former president,” Mr. Coons said.
The meeting also took place the same week that a House committee released its long-awaited report on the run-up to and aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2012, terrorist attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya.
The report did not reveal any conclusive damning information about Mrs. Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time, but it detailed evidence the panel collected about security preparations in the run-up to the attack and why resources might not have been deployed more quickly during the attack itself.

Royal Dutch Shell (rds-a) is reportedly selling some of its assets in the Gulf of Mexico to EnVen Energy for $425 million.
The Brutus/Glider assets, which include a subsea production system, have an estimated production capacity of about 25,000 barrels of oil a day, according to Reuters. That's about 4% of Shell's overall output, or 5.8% of its output within the Gulf.
The sale comes as Shell is looking to shore up profitability amid depressing oil prices and the company's $54 billion acquisition of BG Group earlier this year, Bloomberg reported.
According to Offshore magazine, Shell and EnVen also agreed to a royalty deal “on future production from one of the Glider wells.”

Oil prices rose on Tuesday as companies prepared to suspend production in the U.S. Gulf over a looming tropical storm.
But companies are still feeling the pinch of the massive glut of oil worldwide, which has brought down markets and remains a major policy discussion among international producers. That oversupply may not clear until the second half of 2017, Wim Thomas, Shell's chief energy adviser, told Reuters.
Shell's sale of its assets is expected to close in October.

This remarkable anthology reprints Hugo winner Vinge's (The Collected Stories of Vernor Vinge) "True Names" (1981), the story that began SF's cyberpunk revolution, with 11 essays showing its effect on science as well as fiction. The best are the testimonials by pioneers in virtual reality, cryptography and artificial intelligence. The most famous contributors, Marvin Minsky and Danny Hillis, also show the deepest understanding of Vinge's vision. The weakest pieces are science-fictional, appearing pale in the shadow of Vinge's story. Fellow SF author John M. Ford's essay is lightweight, while a stunted attempt at storytelling by Richard Stallman quickly reverts to polemic. The overall problem with the collection is its wildly unbalanced political stance. A quarter of the essayists are "crypto-anarchists," who see the ability of individuals to act secretly as the only defense against a totalitarian surveillance state. Their claim that the response to public tragedy is always a call to restrict civil rights seems sadly prescient, but their antisocial antidote sits poorly after September 11; the crypto-anarchists' beloved secrecy lets both terrorists and tyrants flourish. More socially responsible uses of cryptography exist that could, like the camcorder, give the power of surveillance to the people. It's a shame that editor Frenkel didn't seek out alternate voices such as Bruce Sterling or David Gelernter, but the book is still a testament to SF's power to shape the future and give us advance warning of the rocky issues ahead.

Bronx, NY – Hip Hop pioneer Afrika Bambaataa's child molestation accusations have brought them very few allies, save for KRS-One, who indubitably felt the burn for their initial comments that not only defended the Zulu Nation founder but dismissed the alleged victims all the same.
Add Bronx native OG Half Pint to the list of recent KRS-One deflectors. While conducting an interview facilitated by Doggie Diamonds TV, Half Pint claimed to have a personal unsavory encounter with Bambaataa at just 12-years-old, where they claimed the man behind “Planet Rock” attempted to test their willingness by barging into the bathroom and whipping out their own penis before they could finish peeing.
In that very same interview, Half Pint redirected their fury towards KRS, alluding to know first hand that them and Bam were cohorts with one another, sexually that is.
“KRS-One, you stupid muthafucka,” they bellowed before adding “Kris, I know Bam sucked your dick.”
“It's no way that you sat there and you tried to like ‘I ain't got nothing with that.' You are a man, you are a man…you don't have anything to do with another man touching little kids. So that mean you would have no problem with Bam sucking the little boys off in your family and putting their finger in my ass. That's you KRS-One. Youare a fuckin' dickhead. Yo, you stupid, yo.”
While sitting in on N.O.R.E. and DJ EFN's “Drink Champs” podcast (an interview that has increasingly become harder to locate across the Internet), The Blastmaster favored the culture above all saying, “Personally — me personally – I don't give a fuck. Look, if somebody was harmed or whatever, y'all gotta deal with that shit. Deal with it. That don't stop Hip Hop. That don't stop what you did for Hip Hop. It doesn't take away none of it. History is history. But deal with that. That's personal” when asked about the Bambaataa allegations.
KRS-One released a statement shortly afterwards, clarifying that they did care about any victims if the accusations turned out to be true but as far as they were concerned, everything tied to Bambaataa's name regarding the ordeal was merely “gossip and sensationalism.”
For that, Half Pint is calling for a boycott of the Hip Hop legend.
“Now all arrangements with this nigga; events with KRS-One, DEAD 'em!” they continued. “For you to say that, I know [Bam] sucked your dick. They had to! They had to! Y'all either had to do things together for you to say that—I was in awe. I did start watching you during the years as we started getting older and I started seeing ‘This nigga stupid.' I have seen you getting stupid so you're saying that, it doesn't surprise me. Youare a fuckin' dummy. KRS-Asshole. That's your name now, KRS-Asshole.”

Azerbaijan has agreed to a deal with Bernie Ecclestone to become the host of the Formula 1 European Grand Prix from 2016.
Speculation regarding a possible race in the former Soviet nation has been growing with a government official revealing a deal is in place with an announcement imminent.
The 4.3km Baku street circuit is believed to be the venue for the grand prix after successfully attracting a 50,000 crowd for last year's FIA GT Series finale.
The venue is due to host the final round of the Blancpain Sprint Series this year.
“We have signed the deal with Bernie Ecclestone and will announce it officially with an event in Baku shortly,” said Azad Rahimov, Azerbaijan's Minister of Youth and Sports, who is also the chief executive of Baku 2015.
If Azerbaijan joins the F1 calendar it will be the second former Soviet nation to be added to the schedule after Russia was included on 2014 roster.
The inaugural F1 Russian Grand Prix is due to take place on October 12.
However, the race could be in jeopardy following Russia's involvement in the Ukrainian crisis on the Crimean peninsula.
The World Superbike Championship has already abandoned its visit to Russia this season citing political reasons for the cancellation of the event.
Green Lantern was a flop and the X-Men spin-off Deadpool looked dead in the water – that is until fans saw test footage of the actor as the wisecracking crimefighter, and decided that the red mask fits
There was a moment around four years ago when it looked like Ryan Reynolds might emerge from rom-com purgatory and find a place for themselves as a wisecracking superhero, alongside the likes of Robert Downey Jr. Reynolds had won acclaim for the unorthodox 2010 indie thriller Buried, in which they were mesmerising as a civilian truck driver who is kidnapped and buried alive by Iraqi insurgents with only a torch and a mobile phone for company. Coupled with a positively received cameo as the superhero Deadpool in the otherwise disappointing X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the Canadian actor was boasting some serious buzz.
Then along came Green Lantern, a supremely ill-conceived 2011 superhero epic about the space-roaming DC comics crimefighter. Reynolds wasn't terrible in it by any means, but the film suffered from hamfisted characterisation, lazy screenwriting and shonky CGI. With its star suddenly far from flavour of the month, 20th Century Fox's proposed Deadpool X-Men spin-off entered studio purgatory.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest The leaked Deadpool test footage
Now the movie seems to be back on, after leaked test footage of Reynolds as the masked antihero caused a huge stir online earlier this year. Variety reported yesterday that a deal is being closed for the movie to enter production, while the film's star posted an image of Deadpool's distinctive mask, depicted in a collage of spent bullets and cartridge cases. The caption? “Uh ... It's Chimichanga Time”, a reference to the character's penchant for deep-fried burritos.

Might Deadpool mark a turn in Reynolds's fortunes? That will depend on whether Fox holds its nerve and delivers a film that lives up to the edgy verve of the test footage, which drew exactly the kind of fanboy gasps you might expect from a superhero movie featuring foul language, extreme violence and a protagonist with obvious mental-health issues. Like Kick-Ass in 2010, Deadpool looks like a fresh take on the formula, as opposed to the Tony Stark-lite in space template used byGreen Lantern. The fact that it's impossible to recognise Reynolds's boyish features in the footage, coupled with the freaky lack of a mouth hole in Deadpool's mask, makes the vision all the more irresistible.
This also ought to be a movie that sidesteps many of the usual credibility issues that superhero movies have. Green Lantern, with its cosmic-space-alien-police-force premise, was always going to be a hard sell; but unlike, say, Batman, Deadpool's penchant for throwing themselves into situations promising almost certain death seems believable. Firstly, they boast the superhero ability to regenerate after almost any injury, and secondly, they really are completely crazy.
The fear, of course, is that Fox will realise that this unorthodox confection really is at best a $100m movie, with a loyal hardcore fanbase but little potential for big-figure box-office returns and zero chance of getting a release in fiercely censorial China. Then begins the slow process of retooling the character and movie for a PG-13 US audience, a process that the little known first-time director Tim Miller would be powerless to resist.
But for now, let's assume that the Deadpool who arrives in February 2016 is the one we've already seen furiously freewheeling across the screen like a nutty whirling dervish. It might just be the start of a Rey-naissance – and you can't even really see the guy acting.
