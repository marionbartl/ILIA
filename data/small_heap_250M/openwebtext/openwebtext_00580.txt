Developed by Voidpoint, a studio comprised of EDuke32 vets and Duke Nukem 3D mappers,was formally announced on a recent Duke4 livestream. It will be published by 3D Realms and is releasing in 2017.First, a bit of background. The Build Engine poweredis a FPS prequel to the poorly received, an isometric shooter from Interceptor Entertainment, a studio which declared bankruptcy last year. A new team called Slipgate Studios was founded earlier this year with many of the same team members.The game's developer, Voidpoint, is an independent venture founded by TerminX and Hendricks266 when creating theports for iOS and Android. Work began on(working titles "The Washington Project" or "Project Washington", and later "The Washington Incident") in early 2015 as a stand-alone project, with the team working on both projects in overlapping fashion until HTTKC was shelved. The game was quietly announced on a poster back in July 2015 as an extra for the digital deluxe version for. Since then, however, the scope has expanded considerably and the game is a full commercial product. The developers' chose the nameto distance themselves from the negativity associated with. The game is running on EDuke32, built in 2004 by Richard Gobeille and continuously developed over the following decade with a view to preserving the original developers' intent of Duke Nukem 3D and to make it playable and enhanced on modern hardware.This is a shooter that's coupling truly retro gameplay with truly retro tech, using the original engine and its ideas, with 20 extra years of development--replacing code, but rarely throwing out ideas. The team has created a brand new 8-bit palette, which all assets will use, essentially turning the era's original aesthetic and creative techniques up to 11 (think Mega Man 9 and 10). The score's being made by someone from the European C64/Amiga demo scene who has been making mod tracker music for about 20 years.Voidpoint's 256 color pallet ( Cage is easily one of the most talented pixel artists around ):There's some seriously talented mappers involved (including DavoX of DNF 2013 DLC fame), with the levels being made with the hallmarks of classic shooters in mind, including interconnecting areas, interactivity, and secrets. All of the weapons have either an alt fire or an alternate ammo type which you switch by pressing alt fire. The team's currently working on a demo (which won't feature the alt fire stuff) much like the FEAR demo, the maps in the demo are redressed samples of portions of the registered version. The team recently showed a video behind closed doors at E3 so I hope we'll see more soon, but in the meantime here are some more screens!Note: the face in the HUD is temp art just cut from a random promo image for Interceptor'sgame. The final game will have a face in the HUD, in much the same way as Doom.
We all lie sometimes, whether you're seeking to hide your true feelings about someone's fruitcake or a housing a deep, dark secret. Nonetheless, most of us don't enjoy being dishonest and you don't have to be. By utilizing misdirection, you can lead others to believe a lie without ever telling it.
What Is Misdirection?
If you've ever seen a magic show, you know all about misdirection. Magicians direct their audience's attention away from the trick so they don't see what's happening. Because we're not paying attention, we miss the obvious and see what we're asked to see. Let's take a look at two common examples.

The Email Forward Card Trick
You may have received this email forward before. You're presented with a set of five cards and asked to choose one:

You'll pick your card and remember it. In the next image, you won't see any cards at all:
Just to be sure you're not looking at the original image, there's yet another image without any cards in it:

Suddenly, your card is gone:
How did that happen? Well, not a single card in the image above was pictured in the original. All the cards are different, so no matter which card you chose you won't see it. You will see five similar cards, however, and because you were spending your mental efforts on remembering your card, rather than the five originals, you neglected to realize this. You were tricked by the powers of misdirection.

Inattentional Blindness
Misdirection works because of a psychological phenomenon called inattentional blindness. David McRaney, author of the book and blog on self-delusion You Are Not So Smart, explains how it works:
You are "blind" to that which you are not attentive. As events unfold before you, you tend to pay attention to a small cone of information and then, when thinking back on what you saw, you tend to believe you saw more than you did. Consciousness is all about filling in the gaps. You assume you know what's happening right outside whatever it is you are focused on, but all over the place, you are imagining the things you can't see.

Need more proof? Watch this video:
The video asks you to count the number of passes to each player, but while all the players are passing a ball a man in a gorilla costume walks through the scene. This happens very obviously, but most first-time viewers miss the gorilla and are shocked to find out it was even present because their attention was diverted to another task. This video used misdirection to prevent you from noticing what was clearly right in front of you. We're going to use this same method to lie without lying.

Use Misdirection to Lie Without Lying
Lying takes effort. When you tell the truth, you simply remember something and say it. When you lie, you consider the truth, whether or not you want to share it, decide that you don't, concoct a lie, and try to say that lie as naturally as you would the truth. Remembering all those steps is hard enough, but certainly not as hard as carrying them out in a matter of seconds. Misdirection still requires more work than truth-telling, but you don't need to figure out a believable alternative to use it. Instead, you simply need to focus the subject's attention on something else and let them concoct the lie using their own imagination. How do you actually do this? Let's consider some examples.

Conceal Your Own Secret
Let's pretend that ten years ago you had a serious drug problem. You've since recovered and your life is great, but you're out on a first date with a person you really like and the waiter asks you to order drinks. Your date orders alcohol and you order water. Your date finds this strange and starts to pry. "Why aren't you drinking?" he or she asks. While I'd argue that owning your problems right away is a better strategy in this situation, and you should be proud of overcoming something so difficult, for the sake of this scenario you're not ready to do that just yet. You have to lie or misdirect.
Advertisement
Lying becomes especially difficult in a situation like this because you 1) have to remember the lie you tell to every person who asks you why you don't drink and 2) you have to remember who you lied to and who you didn't. On top of that, if this relationship goes anywhere you have to tell your date the truth eventually. If you have to recant a lie later, it can damage trust between the two of you. Misdirection, on the other hand, is very simple. Instead of saying something like "I don't like to drink" you can tell a story about another addict you know. Perhaps you've seen a family member fall into addiction, too, or you remember the story of a friend from your recovery program. Tell their story, and let your date conclude that you don't drink because of their experience. Although I've never had a problem with addiction (with the exception of the Taco Zone food truck in Los Angeles), I give this kind of explanation when people ask me why I don't do drugs or drink very often. Nobody ever pushes for more information.
Your personal secrets will vary, but the concept remains the same. Talk about someone or something else in a way that encourages the listener to assume that story is an answer to their question. While not entirely honest, recounting truthful details won't require telling a lie.
Conceal a Friend's Secret
Advertisement
Consider your friend Brian is married to Candice and having an affair with another woman. You're speaking to another friend, Larry, who thinks something's up. Putting all the ethical issues of keeping this secret aside, you don't want to spill the beans. The problem is, Larry guesses and asks you directly if you think Brian is cheating on Candice. You know, and don't want to tell the truth, so you can choose to lie or misdirect.
In this situation, lying is as simple as saying "no." The words are easy, but that provides very little information and you'll likely be pressed to lie further. If you choose to misdirect, you can say something that's actually true and change the course of the conversation. For example, "Brian loves Candice." If true, it implies that Brian wouldn't cheat because he loves his wife. It also asks your friend Larry to consider this as a factor which can quickly derail his thought process.
Of course, people will see right through your attempt if you aren't convincing in your tone of voice. When you're learning to misdirect effectively, two things can help. First, prefacing your statement with the actual lie (e.g. "No, Brian loves Candice") can help you sound more convincing. Second, preemptively concoct your misdirection attempt. Being prepared will make it easier to remember your tactics so you're not forced to figure them out on the spot.
Advertisement
It also helps to have a few alternatives ready. For example, you could say something like "Brian works twelve hour days" (implying he wouldn't have time) or "I just saw them last week and they seemed perfectly happy" (implying that nothing is wrong). While it may sound simplistic, these statements are very effective when you speak them with the confidence of the truth.
Preemptively Misdirect
Advertisement
Misdirecting on the spot requires a quick response. If you're trying to keep a secret, preemptive misdirection allows you far more time to think. You didn't see the gorilla in example video above because you were first asked to pay attention to something else (the passing of a basketball) instead. This method of misdirection is preemptive, causing you to completely miss important information without ever realize it. You can do the same thing when lying.
In the case of your former drug problem, instead of telling the story when asked you can simply share that information in conversation before ever going out on a date. When you don't want to drink, your date won't even think to ask why and you'll never be accused of dishonesty because no situation provoking a lie will even occur. That said, it's more difficult to find a way to introduce a story about an alcoholic friend or family member into the conversation, but if you listen for an opening you'll be able to find away. After all, when you get to know people you'll inevitably talk about others in your lives.
You Need to Practice
Misdirection isn't an inherent talent. You need to practice if you ever hope to convince anyone of what you're saying. While the level of difficulty rests below lying, misdirection still requires more effort. You still have to think of a few things rather than just remember the truth. You have to present what you say naturally and not like a nervous, guilty person. While misdirection will come easier than flat-out fabrication, it still takes work. You can succeed at lying without lying if you've tried and failed before.

All of that said, don't use the benefits of misdirection unless you have a very good reason. Privacy matters, and sometimes you have to go a little south of the truth to keep it, but that doesn't mean you should lie or misdirect maliciously. If you hone your skills, use them responsibly. Misdirection can be an evil trick, but you can use it for the right reasons, too.

Gabi Garcia's combat sports career has hit a couple of minor speed bumps lately. the 6' 2” multiple time world BJJ champion left her grappling roots behind to embark on a full fledged fighting career back in 2015, signing with RIZIN Fighting Federation. She's gone 4-0 since making the jump, with two TKOs and two submissions.
But if 2015-16 was all success, 2017 has been little short of failure, even if Garcia still has yet to officially lose a fight.
Back on July 7th, Garcia took her first Shoot Boxing Match, against longtime journey-woman MMA and kickboxing veteran Megumi Yabushita. The fight was called off in round 1, ruled a no-contest due to illegal soccer kicks from Garcia. Just a few weeks later, and Garcia's return to MMA hasn't gone much better.
Only 16 seconds into the first round of a bout against Oksana Gagloeva, Garcia stuck her out-stretched hand into Gagloeva's face, poking her in the eyes and resulting in an immediate end to the contest. You can see video below:
For her part, Garcia seems to be claiming that no foul was committed and that doctors cleared Gagloeva to continue in the bout.
"It was not (the tip of) my finger,” Garcia told MMA Fighting. "I defended with an open hand, but closed it for the punch. She has both eyes hurt. The doctors authorized her to come back but she didn't want to. Coward." "You could see in her eyes that the show ‘ate' her. She could have come back, but it was an easy way to run.”
All doctors ok for she fights! Is not my finger! Is LEGAL! She gives up! Pussy! If accepted trying not coward — #rizinff Gabi Garcia (@gabijiu) July 30, 2017
MMA Fighting also reports that Garcia will apparently appeal the no-contest ruling. She's hoping to return to competition in October, but dismissed the idea of a rematch with Gagloeva, reiterating her feelings that Gagloeva is a “coward,” and that Gagloeva “ran” from the fight.
Cory Doctorow held a presentation just before the turn of the year, showing how the current copyright wars are just a skirmish in the battles yet to come. It is a very strong omen that gives you an idea just how much is at stake in the coming two decades.
Doctorow's presentation is here. It is time well spent — Cory Doctorow is also quite the entertainer, even with a very serious message. If you want to speedread a transcript instead, you can do so here.
In short, Doctorow argues that the copyright industry's fight isn't against copying, but against general-purpose computers. As more and more devices we buy are general-purpose hardware devices with custom software designed to make that hardware do certain things out of the box, that custom software that drives the device is also custom-izable software that lets the hardware be recoded and repurposed to do completely different things.
Shortly, we'll see basically every industry trying to crack down on the freedom to tinker, to keep the products they sold us in the same state as they were before we owned them. This is exactly where we're headed if the current trends continue.
The problem is that many people don't understand what a general-purpose computer is. Legislators still think in terms of hardware: A cassette player can only play a cassette. Therefore, a music player today must only play music.
That's wrong of course. A music player today can be recoded to play, stream, receive, remix, or do other things with music. Or, for that matter, it could probably be recoded to become a networked earthquake early-warning sensor instead, if its microphone was sensitive enough to sense the low-frequency sounds that forebode earthquakes.
This idea — that an off-the-shelf entertainment device can be repurposed to become an earthquake early-warning sensor with just the copying of a file — is mind-boggling to today's legislators. It is just so far out it doesn't reflect sunlight any more. And it is with this mindset that they legislate that breaking any DRM — repurposing devices that you own — should be punishable with jail time.
This is the reason that I keep reminding the world why we need to ban DRM altogether. It is corporations writing their own laws restricting your property.
But it goes beyond that. Let's return to the concept of the general-purpose computer. In the mindset of today's oldish legislators, if you want to kill the possibility of broadcasting music from a music player, you remove some piece from that device. Just like you would remove a “stream” button from a keyboard.
But as we know, it doesn't work like that. If you want to prevent a general-purpose computer from running a certain type of code, you have to add something to it. You have to add code that prevents it from running this type of code, which it has been designed to do, after all.
And this is where it gets interesting. Since you own the general-purpose computer, you can run any code on it — including code that removes the code preventing you from running some types of code. These instructions that kill the DRM restrictions, seen from the device's point of view, is just any kind of code that the device will execute happily.
And so protection for the removal of the DRM code is built in next, like Sony did with its criminal rootkit in 2005 (which is why Sony is on my permanent blacklist). So then that code is removed first by the person owning the device, followed by the DRM code.
The general-purpose computer is, by its very definition, a device where DRM will never work.
The major problem is that legislators don't understand this. They don't understand that you need to add something to the device to make it less functional, and that this something can easily be removed by an end-user to restore full functionality again. So we get an endless nightmare where legislators mandate more code, more laws, more code, and yet more laws to try to add restricting code to our general-purpose devices, code that we can easily remove.
We need to shift the viewpoint and narrative on this story — we need to make legislators understand the concept of a general-purpose computer, and that by definition, you can't restrict it from running code. We need Freedom to Code at the citizen level, at the same constitutional level as Freedom of Speech, even if it goes against corporate interests. No, scratch that: especially when it goes against corporate interests.
Of course, one might argue that general freedom to code would also be a freedom to code those pesky DRM restrictions. That is true on a philosophical level. The fight here, however, is to get an understanding of the general-purpose computer on a conceptual level into legislatures.

According to Strater, Kivimaki called in false threats to American law enforcement, which results in SWAT teams arriving at his residence. For almost three years, Kivimaki harassed his family by stealing their identities and ruining their finances and personal lives.
Kivimaki's computer hacking charges include data breaches, telecommunication harassments, payment fraud, and other counts related to fraudulence and violations of company secrets.
Businessman and 2016 GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump said the fact that troops at the naval reserve center in Tennessee where four Marines were killed Thursday had restrictions on being armed “is absolutely ridiculous.”
“It's a lack of respect, Bill, for our country, for our officials, for our leaders — it's a total lack of respect, it's a breakdown, and frankly, a gun-free zone, these are four great Marines from what everybody tells me, unbelievable people, and that they're not allowed to carry guns is absolutely ridiculous,” Mr. Trump said Thursday evening via phone on Fox News' “The O'Reilly Factor. “So what happens is this guy walks in, he's got a gun, they're just sitting there as targets — it's absolutely disgraceful.”
Kuwaiti-born Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez was fatally shot outside a Navy-Marine training center in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Thursday after killing four Marines, officials said.
Asked about potential backlash against Muslim-Americans in the wake of the killings, Mr. Trump said: “Well, at some point, it's probably going to happen and, you know, you have the term ‘Islamic terrorism,' which the president refuses to use even though there seems to be quite a bit of it. If you look around the world, certainly it's there, there's something going on.”
President Obama on Thursday called the killings “heartbreaking” and urged people not to jump to conclusions.
“But it seems so sad that a whole group of people have to be blamed, but it does seem to be happening a lot, Bill, and whether it's here or in other countries, it certainly is there, and there is a form of Islamic terrorism. President Obama refuses to use the term, and nobody can quite understand why,” he said.
Mr. O'Reilly said he was sure Mr. Trump had a theory.
“Well, I think I won't say my theory right now, but he should certainly — if we're going to fight elements that are causing tremendous problems, at least we have to start maybe being not so politically correct and this is happening, it's happening all over, it's happening outside of our country big league. It's going to get worse in our country, and we better start fighting a lot tougher than we're fighting right now, Bill, because we're going in the wrong direction in so many different ways — not just this, but in so many different ways,” he said.
Speaking via phone Friday on MSNBC's “Morning Joe,” Mr. Trump reiterated his criticism of so-called “gun free zones” and said that “we're going to have to get much tougher with law enforcement.”
“It's a very tough situation for the country, and we're going to have to increase our intel groups, and we have some great groups and frankly, we're going to have to get much tougher with law enforcement,” he said. “You know, we have law enforcement that's afraid to go up to people now. They don't want to lose their job. They want to get their pension in 20 years, etcetera. And we're going to have to let our law enforcement go.”
“I can't imagine that some people in the area didn't see that he was going off the wire and couldn't have reported him in some form,” Mr. Trump said later.

Kristyn Wong-Tam (open Kristyn Wong-Tam's policard) is a big fan of the Pan Am Games, which close on Sunday after a successful 16-day run. She also likes the idea of Toronto hosting the 2024 Summer Olympics. But what most excites the city councillor is the possibility of Toronto staging Expo 2025, a major world fair that could attract more than 40 million visitors.
Toronto Councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam is convinced Toronto's successful staging of the Pan Am Games could go a long way in helping the city seek the rights to Expo 2025. ( Mark Blinch / THE CANADIAN PRESS )
“Expos have the power to transform cities,” Wong-Tam says as she talks passionately of her dream of Toronto hosting the international fair in 2025. “It happened in Shanghai, Montreal and Vancouver. It's happening right now in Milan with Expo 2015. If they can do it, why can't we do it here?” Wong-Tam is convinced Toronto's successful staging of the Pan Am Games could go a long way in helping the city seek the rights to Expo 2025. But Toronto city council is facing a huge dilemma: Should it bid for the 2024 Olympics or the 2025 Expo?
Article Continued Below
It's a major decision — and it must be made within weeks, not months or years. That's because Sept. 15 is the deadline for the city to submit a letter of intent to the International Olympic Committee to bid for the 2024 Games. Formal bids will be made in mid-2016, with the IOC choosing the winning city in the summer of 2017. An Expo bid must be formally submitted by Nov. 1, 2016, with the Paris-based Bureau International des Expositions (BIE), which governs such events, selecting the winner in late 2017. Supporters of an Olympics bid have been vocal in the past two weeks, arguing that the success of the Pan Am Games has boosted the city's chances of winning the 2024 Games. Wong-Tam, though, makes a convincing argument that, as much as she would like to see the Olympics here, the city would be much better off if it held Expo 2025.
She says Expo 2025, which would run for six months (as opposed to three weeks for the Olympics), would bring more tourists to the area, create tens of thousands of additional jobs and leave a better infrastructure and transit legacy, especially in the Port Lands, than would the Olympics. She talks of a Toronto Expo as being socially responsible, inclusive and environmentally sustainable, adding that it would be beneficial for city building and national identity. An Expo “is not just a party,” but an event that could be the catalyst for an economic boom with long-term benefits for the city and the region, much as occurred in Montreal and Vancouver during their Expos in 1967 and 1986 respectively.
Article Continued Below
The councillor for Ward 27 (Toronto Centre-Rosedale) is so enthusiastic about a potential Toronto bid that she will be visiting Expo 2025 in Milan and meeting officials there next month during her vacation. She is paying for the trip entirely out of her own pocket. As well, she is working with Tory to invite Vicente Gonzalez Loscertales, secretary-general of the BIE, to visit Toronto in November or December and to deliver a keynote luncheon address about the power of Expos to transform cities. Toronto has tried in recent years to host the World Expo, which is held every five years. In 2006, it missed a deadline to bid for the 2015 Expo, which subsequently was awarded to Milan. In 2012, city council supported conducting a feasibility study, but Prime Minister Stephen Harper squashed the idea. His support was critical because any bid by Toronto actually has to be submitted by the federal government. Harper is worried about costs, but Wong-Tam says there are solid business reasons why Toronto should stage Expo 2025. A feasibility study conducted in 2014 for city council projected Expo 2025 would create 190,000 jobs, generate $5.4 billion new tax revenues and spark $15.5 billion in economic activity, with more than half of it in the GTA. Total cost for Expo was forecast at up to $13.5 billion, compared to $17.1 billion for the Olympics. The biggest extra Olympic cost is the $800 million to $1 billion for a 90,000-seat stadium. To date, the leading contenders for Expo 2025 are London and Paris. Both have the solid backing of their national and local governments. Wong-Tam is right to push for the Expo 2025 bid. So too are proponents who are seeking the Olympics in 2024. Both projects would create jobs, build infrastructure and leave lasting legacies that could make this city proud. And there is no reason why both bids can't go forward at the same time. That's exactly what Paris is doing with its Olympic and Expo bids. With the Pan Am Games, Toronto has proven it can play host to the world. We can do it again with the 2024 Olympics and Expo 2025. Bob Hepburn's column appears Sunday. bhepburn@thestar.ca
For many liberals watching Donald Trump step away from his base on immigration, the only question is whether his supporters are primarily cultish or primarily racist. Recently, MSNBC host Chris Hayes wrote up a widely circulated post offering a compromise view—that the cultishness of Trump's supporters was a product of their racism. Since Barack Obama had “disrupted the country's entire history by putting a black man in the White House” and made himself “a symbol of nonwhite power,” argued Hayes, the return of a white president would allow white voters to feel their power was restored, “both in actual terms and symbolically.” Immigration amnesties will therefore no longer “have the same existential sting for his most ardent voters,” who will accept them because they're being presided over by the white president and his white majority. “It was never about the policies anyway,” Hayes asserts.
Well.
Let us concede that no one entirely understands the relationship between Donald Trump and his “deplorables,” including Trump and his deplorables. They have tolerated attacks on Jeff Sessions and the bombing of Syria, two moves in defiance of Trump the campaigner, and this suggests they're prepared to tolerate more. Perhaps reality is in sync with Hayes's vision, and Trump voters are less like ordinary Americans and more like the hairy hominids of Stanley Kubrick's 2001, shrieking in alarm over the black president and jumping in wonder before the Trumpian monolith. But perhaps not.
From what I've seen and reported, Trump's voters aren't racist in the way that Hayes thinks they are. Nor are they ignorant or indifferent to policy. Most (although I now move to a reliance on recent reading rather then direct reporting) also seem to accept that today's “Dreamers” are going to get an amnesty, defined here as the granting of citizenship to someone who has been living in the United States illegally. But the question is this: in exchange for what? If Trump imposes only trivial conditions, then many, perhaps even most, of his deplorables will indeed turn on him. At least that's how I'd bet.
To explain why, we have to remember why immigration policy is such a sore point among at least a quarter of Americans and why it played such a big role in Trump's ascendance.
That means first backing away from the story that Trump's rise was primarily the product of a crazed reaction to the novelty of a black president. Race divides Americans, but partisanship divides them far more. When I was in Lakeland, Florida, in 2015, conservatives of all colors were waiting in endless rope lines to get an autograph from Ben Carson, who was leading the polls and hawking a book, just as I saw conservatives of all colors waiting hours in 2011 to get a glimpse of Herman Cain, who was likewise leading the polls and hawking a book. These voters spoke of Carson and Cain as if they were gods.
At the same time, many of these same voters spoke of Barack Obama as if he were Lucifer. Liberals often argue that racial animosity is to blame for this, pointing in particular to how many Republicans (over two-thirds), including Donald Trump, embraced conspiracies about Obama being born in Kenya. Certainly, there's no way to disprove that race played a primary role in such theorizing, since minds can't be read and counterfactuals are unavailable. Consider, though, how prone Americans have always been to come up with conspiracy theories about political enemies of any stripe. “Birther” rumors also trailed Sarah Palin. Today, over half of Democrats believe that Russia rigged the vote tallies in the U.S. election of 2016. In 2011, more than half thought it was at least “somewhat likely” that George W. Bush knew about the 9/11 plot in advance. Many Republicans continue to believe that the death of Vince Foster, a White House attorney under Bill Clinton, was not a suicide. Heck, historians still argue over whether Chester Arthur was really born in Canada. We're a conspiracy-minded people.

Next, we must take into account that no issue has come close to immigration in its power to divide Republican officeholders from the people who elect them. For some Republican voters, immigration has become issue number one in importance, but even those who put it lower on their list of priorities often have a major grudge against their elected officials on the subject. The reason is simple: politicians have broken promises and told lies about it again and again.
Some immigration hawks start the clock already back in 1965, when senators promised, incorrectly, that a major retooling of the immigration system would have only a modest impact on the number of people coming to the country. The more important juncture, though, was in 1986, when an amnesty that was supposed to legalize 2.7 million people and implement a strict protocol of enforcement instead wound up legalizing everyone but lax enforcement and an illegal influx of another 11 million people. Meanwhile, the millions who were amnestied could take advantage of family-unification provisions in order to bring over millions more—parents, spouses, children, and siblings, who in turn could do the same. The voting power of this cohort, which has generally been resistant to enforcement, is a major part of what has caused Democrats to shy away from enforcement altogether. It's also what causes border hawks to fear that we're one more amnesty away from losing control of the border for good.
Since 1986, no immigration hawk has believed any promises of “amnesty now, enforcement later,” and Republicans have usually talked tough on immigration on the campaign trail, whether it's John McCain or, most notably, Marco Rubio, who won his Senate seat as a hard-liner. But that hasn't stopped these same elected officials from reversing course once in office, either because of secret preferences for high immigration or because of non-secret closeness to party donors. Rubio took the lead in trying to sell the Gang of Eight bills in 2013—a bipartisan effort that notably included Trump whisperer Chuck Schumer—almost certainly dooming his prospects for higher office. Donald Trump's rhetoric on the issue appealed to his voters precisely as it was offensive and unrestrained. If the people who sounded sensible were just going to reverse themselves on enforcement, then why not go with the guy who sounded crazy? Odds were better that he'd mean business.
If Trump were to pull a Rubio, therefore, or even something less dramatic, it would topple the central pillar of his candidacy. Pat Buchanan has suggested it would be as lethal to Trump as the violation in 1990 of a no-new-taxes pledge was to George H. W. Bush, and Buchanan should know, since it helped inspire him to run against Bush in the primaries of 1992. It might well be even more damaging, since Bush had at least delivered a number of legislative achievements and, for better or worse, a swiftly concluded war against Iraq. Trump, by contrast, has delivered mainly bluster. Also, tax hikes are a reversible concession, whereas citizenship is not.
This is why so many immigration wonks are monitoring the fate of legislation that was unveiled in August by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton and Georgia Senator David Perdue. Known as the RAISE Act, it would cause immigrants to be selected in a manner similar to that employed by Canada, which grants priority to those with high skills. It would also put an end to the current policies of “chain migration,” phasing out the current preferences for adult children and siblings, thereby also forestalling complaints that the Dreamers who receive amnesty will automatically reward those who broke the law bringing them here. The idea of pairing the RAISE Act and stricter enforcement with amnesty for the 800,000 Dreamers is being floated by immigration hawks, and indications are that Breitbart and other conservative outlets would restrict themselves to grumbling about such a bargain rather than launching a full-on attack. If, on the other hand, Trump gives away his leverage for a deal that merely boosts spending on the border, he'll trigger an outcry.
This, then, is the lay of the land on which the deplorables are standing. To be sure, at least half of them are likely to stick with Trump no matter what. To that extent, commenters like Chris Hayes are right. But the other half care a lot about immigration policy, for reasons that have little to do with racial mysticism and much to do with taming a border-control problem that has gotten worse for most of the past 40 years. If outlets like Breitbart and the Daily Caller and voices like those of Laura Ingraham and Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh accuse Trump of betrayal on this issue, those deplorables are likely to take their cues from them and agree. And they're unlikely to forgive him for it, no matter how white—or, in Trump's case, orange—he may be.

Adam Lallana is set to miss Liverpool's Premier League clash with Arsenal at the Emirates tonight due to injury.
The England international is understood to have been ruled out of the trip to the capital due to a thigh problem.
It's unclear at this stage how long Lallana will be sidelined for but he's now a doubt for England's Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Switzerland next month.
It's the latest injury setback to blight Lallana's Liverpool career since his £25million move from Southampton a year ago.
IN PICS: The team YOU want to see against Arsenal
He missed the whole of pre-season in 2014 due to knee ligament damage and on his return his progress was hampered by a succession of niggling problems.
After a solid pre-season this time around, he was selected by Brendan Rodgers to line up against Stoke and Bournemouth in the opening Premier League matches of the new campaign. But now he's facing another spell on the sidelines.
In Lallana's absence, Roberto Firmino is expected to make his first start for the Reds against Arsenal.
With Jordan Henderson hampered by a foot injury, James Milner is expected to captain the side.
Modric joined Spurs from Dinamo Zagreb for £16.6m in 2008
Luka Modric has no plans to hand in a transfer request at Tottenham, according to his agent Nikky Vuksan.
The Croatia international, 25, hinted he would like to join Chelsea but Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is adamant the midfielder cannot leave the club.
Vuksan told BBC Sport: "I don't think he'll hand in a transfer request. He will honour his contract.
"He wants to play Champions League and win trophies. The only way we can resolve this is to sit down and talk."
He added: "Luka will report today for training and will do his best, as always."
Earlier in the summer, Modric was the subject of a £22m bid from Chelsea, which was rejected by Spurs.
Modric met Levy on Wednesday and Spurs' chairman revealed he had made it clear that the player would not be allowed to leave the club.
"That's the end of it," Levy said. "As I said a few weeks ago there's no further discussion. He was on holiday so we've now had the conversation and he understands our position."
Vuksan insisted he wanted to avoid any acrimony with Tottenham though.
"I have never been in a situation before where a player has had to fight a club and it's not something we want to do," he said. "The only official offer so far is from Chelsea and we haven't talked to any clubs.
"It's no surprise that there is interest in Luka though, because he is a top, top player."
Modric joined the London club in a £16.6m deal from Dinamo Zagreb in 2008. He quickly established himself as a key figure, helping them to qualify for the Champions League in his second season at the club.
Modric signed a new six-year deal at the club only last year, with manager Harry Redknapp describing him as "irreplaceable".
Redknapp has been pleased with his player's demeanour as he joined his team-mates for pre-season training today but concedes it is tough for him.
"He's walked in today and is happy, but the kid's a bit confused at the moment. Other teams want him but we want him here and I want to keep him," Redknapp said.
"He loves playing here. It's a difficult situation for him and I understand where he's coming from. We can't kid ourselves.
"He signed a contract here, we love him here and want him here. We don't want to sell our best players. He's a special player for us."
Three months after Taking Back Sunday announced the timeline for their new album, EW is excited to reveal that the group's seventh collection, called Tidal Wave, is due out Sept. 16 on Hopeless Records.
“We started writing in between tours on the [2014 album] Happiness Is cycle,” frontman Adam Lazzara tells EW. The band wrote and recorded in Michigan and Charlotte, North Carolina, where Lazzara and guitarist John Nolan both live. “It was a great sense of home.”
The name Tidal Wave is taken from the collection's first single, which they've been playing at recent live shows. “Even throughout each song on the record there are a lot of references to water,” Lazzara explains. “That's why it seems like that title kept poking its neck out.”
The collection, though, may strike longtime fans as a retreat from the sound that made them famous with albums like 2002's Tell All Your Friends and 2004's Where You Want To Be. “Tidal Wave is a bit of a departure but I don't think its coming out of left field,” Lazzara says. “We realize anything we do is going to sound like Taking Back Sunday.
When asked if he would classify Tidal Wave as part of the emo genre associated with their past albums, Lazzara explains, “Look, in my mind every album anyone's ever written is an emo album because there's a lot of emotion that goes into all of that. You can't listen to ‘Hey Jude' and tell me that's not an emo song. I don't like being pigeonholed because I think there's more to it than that. I think this record highlights that very well, so no I wouldn't consider it an emo record in the traditional sense of the word.”
He continues, “With our first records, we're writing from the perspective of 17, 18-year-old kids and now it's like as you grow older the blinders get pulled back and you have a different way of looking at the world around you.”
Instead, he says they were inspired by albums from rockers like Tom Petty and Bryan Adams. “There's more of an Americana feel.”
Currently on tour with Dashboard Confessional as part of the Taste of Chaos run, Taking Back Sunday have plans to tour with Tidal Wave later this year. “Our idea is to go to the smallest clubs we can go to. We'd like to debut this record as honestly as we can and what better way to do that in a small club?”
TEL AVIV (Reuters) - A bomb exploded on a bus in central Tel Aviv on Wednesday, wounding 15 people in what Israeli officials said was a terrorist attack that could complicate efforts to secure a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.
Celebratory gunfire rang out across Gaza as the news spread and the territory's Islamist rulers Hamas praised the bombing, but no one claimed immediate responsibility.
The blast shattered windows on the bus as it drove along a tree-lined street next to Israel's huge defense ministry headquarters. Israel's ambulance service said four people suffered moderate-to-severe injuries and 11 were lightly hurt.
Police said it was not a suicide attack and suggested that someone might have left the device on the number 142 bus.
The driver, who escaped largely unscathed, told reporters he had not seen anyone suspicious get on board.
“I felt the explosion ... Smoke was everywhere, you couldn't see a thing,” he said. The blue and white vehicle was not torn apart by the blast, indicating it was a relatively small device.
The bombing happened on the eighth day of an Israeli offensive against the Gaza Strip and coincided with intensive diplomatic efforts to secure a lasting truce.
Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri hailed the explosion.
“Hamas blesses the attack in Tel Aviv and sees it as a natural response to the Israeli massacres...in Gaza,” he told Reuters. “Palestinian factions will resort to all means in order to protect our Palestinian civilians in the absence of a world effort to stop the Israeli aggression.”

Sweet cakes were handed out in celebration in Gaza's main hospital, which has been inundated with wounded from the round-the-clock Israeli bombing and shelling.
“GATES OF HELL”
“You opened the gates of hell on yourselves,” Hamas's armed wing, the al-Qassam brigades, said on Twitter. “Oh Zionists, you have to drag yourselves out of hell, go back home now, go back to Germany, Poland, Russia, America and anywhere else.”
The last time a bomb blast hit Israel's commercial capital was in April 2006, when a Palestinian suicide bomber killed 11 people at a sandwich stand near the old central bus station.
Hamas militants have fired at least four rockets at the laid-back Mediterranean metropolis over the past week, but they scored no direct hits and caused no casualties.
Israel launched its air offensive with the stated aim of halting all missile launches out of the Gaza Strip, which lies some 70 km (40 miles) south of Tel Aviv, a cosmopolitan city renowned for its nightlife and vibrant beach culture.
Hamas had warned when the latest conflict flared that it would not confine itself to unleashing rockets.
“This was a terror attack. There is a massive preparedness within the police and security forces. We must keep awareness to a maximum. These are not normal times,” said Israel's Police Chief Yohanan Danino.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon denounced the attack, saying nothing justified the targeting of civilians.

The United States, Israel's main ally, also condemned the bus bombing. “These attacks against innocent Israeli civilians are outrageous,” the White House said.
More than 140 Palestinians, more than half of them civilians, have died so far in Israel's Gaza offensive. Five Israelis, including one soldier, have also been killed.
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, trying to calm tensions over Gaza, flew from Israel to Cairo to meet Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi, who is spearheading ceasefire negotiations.
At the Grand Challenges conference in London, innovations in refrigeration and sanitation are among those making a difference to global healthcare
It was a walk past a frozen lake 10 years ago that got Ian Tansley thinking differently about global health. The Welsh inventor had spent decades travelling and developing solar technologies throughout Africa and Asia. Yet one puzzle he was keen to crack – how to deliver vaccines on a wide-scale basis to the poorest, most remote communities – had so far eluded him.
Vaccines are notoriously hard to deliver safely, requiring refrigeration at certain temperatures, which means having access to a constant power supply. Yet hot climates, intermittent availability of electricity, supply shortages and unreliable storage facilities mean that one in five children – more than 19m worldwide – do not get even the most basic immunisations to keep them healthy.
How Sri Lanka bit back at mosquitoes and wiped out malaria – podcast Read more
Using the frozen lake as his inspiration, with its frozen top but liquid bottom, Tansley developed a refrigeration system, Sure Chill, that harnesses water's unique properties to keep vaccines cool at 4C – yet doesn't require a constant power supply. The refrigeration compartment is surrounded by water, and relies on the fact that the liquid is at its heaviest at 4C, when it sinks. When the device has power, the water cools and forms ice above the compartment, leaving only water at 4C cooling the contents. When the power is switched off, the water warms and rises while the ice begins to melt, and water at 4C remains below to keep the vaccines chilled.
Sure Chill – which was awarded a $1.5m (£1.2m) Grand Challenges grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and is now used to deliver vaccines in 38 countries – has proved a major breakthrough in global health. Tansley's immunisations cold-box can keep vaccines cool for up to 35 days in even 43C weather. And the technology is entirely scaleable, from a cool box up to a warehouse.
Naming it one of the top four innovations saving children's lives, the Gates Foundation's director of vaccine delivery, Dr Orin Levine, calls Sure Chill “an important tool in humanitarian response efforts” and says it demonstrates, for the first time in decades, a global health issue “benefiting from significant innovation”.
Innovation is the theme of this year's Grand Challenges global conference, taking place in London this week. Experts from all over the world will address key questions in tackling global health challenges, including innovations in achieving the sustainable development goals, treating infectious diseases, and developing collaborations between north and south.
Equally problematic in the global health challenge is poor sanitation: 40% of the world's population currently lacks adequate toilet facilities, which in turn contributes to poor health and devastating environmental impacts.

Loowatt was granted a $1.3m investment to develop a waterless toilet system. Developed by Virginia Gardiner, an American journalist-turned-industrial design engineer, Loowatt has had a massive impact in Madagascar, where a pilot public toilet project has grown to provide 100 toilets for private use within family homes, and is set to be rolled out across other countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
The toilets seal waste into a portable cartridge within biodegradable film, and combine anaerobic digestion with pasteurisation in order to kill off any waterborne diseases. The waste is collected and converted into fertiliser and biogas, which is then used for cooking and electricity.
The toilets are particularly essential in regions where waterborne diseases are prevalent, or where shared – or a complete lack of – toilets prevent women and girls from going to the bathroom, says Gardiner.
“People are going from having pit latrines at home to our toilets in their homes, which means they're not being exposed to eco-pathogens in their everyday lives any more,” says Gardiner. “The current model can support 2,000 people – in urban or rural settings – and is important in showing that in this global sanitation crisis, there is technology out there than can convert waste into energy.”
Both Gardiner's and Tansley's systems get to the heart of what the Grand Challenges are about – improving the lives of the world's most vulnerable. Tansley has been surprised at just how much his Sure Chill technology has changed the face of medical outreach. “The people benefiting the most are generally the poorest people in the most remote places, the people you just wouldn't normally see: rural agricultural communities far from any infrastructure or power grid,” he says. “Maybe they're nomadic or very dispersed – they're people who weren't being reached before.”

Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump says he raised $5.6 million for veterans during his fundraiser in January before the Iowa caucus.
“I have raised a tremendous amount of money for the vets,” Trump said during a press conference at Trump Tower in New York City, adding, “almost six million dollars.” He says he expects more money to come in,
“I have been thanked by so many veterans groups throughout the United States,” Trump said.
He told the media that “all of the money has been paid out,” but spent the majority of his time slamming the liberal press for, instead of praising him for the money raised for veterans, questioning his intentions with the money.
“I will say that the press should be ashamed of themselves,” Trump criticized, adding that he will provide a list of where the money went.
Trump went on to list more than 42 veterans organizations and detailed how much money he has sent to each group.
“Zero dollars have been taken out for administration,” he added. “These are checks that have been delivered that have been cashed that are now being used to help the vets.”
“The press is so dishonest and so unfair,” he added. “What I got was worse than credit because they were questioning me,” he added about the press, saying he wants to be accountable for the money, but didn't want all of the credit.
“Find out how much Hillary Clinton has given to the veterans. Nothing,” he challenged the media.
“I shouldn't be lambasted,” he said, adding, “Not one penny did I take for administration cost.”
Trump also commented on the small group of veterans protesting against him outside of Trump Tower, which were affiliated with Hillary Clinton's campaign.
“They're sent there by Hillary Clinton and their picketing,” Trump said, suggesting they're protesting because of wanting to know where the money was donated. “The money has all been sent.”
“I wanted to keep it private,” Trump added.
Trump supporter and New Hampshire state Rep. Al Baldasaro jumped in to defend Trump against the media.
“Donald Trump is doing this for the heart,” Baldasaro stated, telling the press to look at his Veterans Affairs reform plan. He told the liberal media that they “need to get your head out of your butt and focus on the real issues.”
Trump also promised to continue to challenge the press if he is elected President of the United States.

Maryland workplace shooting suspect Radee Labeeb Prince, 37, has been taken into custody by authorities, the Harford County Sheriff's Office reported Wednesday night.
Prince had reportedly been traveling in a 2008 GMC Acadia after police say he opened fire on five people at an office park in Edgewood, Maryland, which left three people dead and two people injured around 9 a.m.
The vehicle was located after police received a tip at around 5:35 p.m.
Prince was apprehended without incident after a brief foot chase shortly thereafter by ATF Baltimore agents and allied law enforcement partners in Newark, Delaware, according to authorities. Police say Prince had a weapon on him at the time of his apprehension.
At 8:02 p.m., police led Prince into the Wilmington Police Department.

GameStop to increase focus on phones & tablets instead of video games It may have "game" in its name, but retailer GameStop has announced plans to start increasing its focus on "gaming-adjacent" fields while lessening its reliance on video games.
It may have "game" in its name, but retailer GameStop has announced plans to start increasing its focus on "gaming-adjacent" fields while lessening its reliance on video games. CEO Paul Raines dubbed the initiative "GameStop 3.0," saying that it plans on closing about 2 percent of its retail locations, while opening Spring Mobile and Simply Mac stores instead.
The two GameStop-owned retail brands focus on selling AT&T-branded phones and Apple products. According to GI.biz, GameStop plans on opening over 200 Spring Mobile stores and 20 Simply Mac stores--essentially doubling the footprint of both franchises.
By transitioning away from video games, the company hopes to be like other companies that have made similar leaps. Williams-Sonoma, for example, began as a kitchen equipment retailer that now owns Pottery Barn and West Elm. Perhaps the "stop" in their name meant that they were planning to stop selling games one day?

"Boom! Boom! Boom!" Three loud explosions had just interrupted General Westmoreland's interview with dozens of reporters. They had gathered to question Westmoreland, America's commander of military operations in its war against Vietnam's reunification, and to report on the 1968 TET Offensive. Although he tried to muster a smile, it was evident that Westmoreland was irritated, even dazed and confused.
The Vietnamese had just attacked over one-hundred targets. Westmoreland was trying to reassure reporters that major combat operations were over. At first, he said EOD forces were setting off the explosions. But when more explosions occurred, followed by small arms fire, he became angry and stuttered, "The enemy was deceitful, taking advantage of the cease fire...They...they...the...are causing maximum consternation."
Consternation, or feeling alarmed and shocked, was a good word to describe America's war in Vietnam. During the TET offensive, one soldier claimed the "enemy was nowhere and everywhere." The Vietnamese were also difficult to dislodge. Fighting raged from house to house and roof to roof. While U.S. soldiers tried clearing buildings and homes, burning them to the ground, they were met with sniper fire.
Until Vietnam's TET Offensive in 1968, the Johnson Administration repeatedly told Americans it had a winning strategy. Generals, political officials, and the president himself, continually proclaimed United States troops were making progress and that the military situation was improving. They repeatedly said they could see the light at the end of the tunnel. But in reality, it was another public relations campaign, another publicity stunt.
Meanwhile, the Vietnamese were planning a major offensive to change the course of the war. The U.S. military was aware of the offensive, which involved highly coordinated attacks against one-hundred U.S. military installations, airfields, and naval stations. But few wanted to believe it could be possible. Flawed military data and a dependency on enemy body counts fed the assumption that the Vietnamese could not replace those killed.
But a major Vietnamese offensive did occur and it was very devastating. Military bases were attacked and besieged, including the U.S. Embassy in Saigon. Some attacks were crushed in a matter of days, but others continued for months. And then there was the scene that stunned the world. At point blank range, South Vietnam's Chief of Police executed an alleged Vietnamese guerilla by shooting him in the head.
Beliefs are extremely powerful and are necessary for a society to function. They can either be constructive or destructive in their nature. The TET Offensive demolished the belief that the U.S. military controlled South Vietnam and had won the hearts and minds of its people. It also revealed political and military officials were in a state of denial and had chosen to embrace an unrealistic mission. There would be no light at the end of the tunnel.
Before his death, Richard Holbrooke, envoy to Afghanistan, thought the military conflict in Afghanistan could become President Barack Obama's Vietnam. According to Holbrooke, some of the talks with Obama in the Situation Room reminded him of conversations with President Lyndon Johnson in the White House. When Holbrooke raised the issue of possibly losing in Afghanistan, Obama did not want to hear about it.
The recent sustained attacks against the U.S. Embassy, NATO Headquarters, and other military targets in the heart of Kabul, are again raising fresh doubts if American forces are winning in Afghanistan. A massive bombing that just wounded dozens of U.S. soldiers again challenges the belief that U.S. forces are securing the hearts and minds of Afghans. A sharp rise in civilian casualties forces one to wonder who the real enemy is.
These attacks come on the heels of an ongoing offensive, one that started months ago. In the midst of air strikes, Afghan insurgents overran U.S. and NATO positions in Nuristan and Kunar. In Kandahar in southern Afghanistan, government buildings and U.S.-NATO troops were hit in several days of heavy fighting. Meanwhile, Britain's former ambassador accused American commanders of citing Taliban deaths as a sign of progress.
Afghan insurgents now control Waygal district too, where they recently overran U.S.-Afghan troops while raising the white flag of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. The Spring Offensive has also occurred in provinces like Zabul, Paktika, and Kamdesh, where several NATO and U.S. troops were killed. Since many Afghan insurgents are allied with tribes in Pakistan, it is difficult to prevent supplies and new fighters from arriving.
Despite President Obama increasing troop strength last year by adding an extra 30,000-bringing the total number to just over 100,000-a new report revealed both U.S. and Afghan fighters are experiencing tremendous combat-induced stress and low morale, mixed with anxiety and depression. And even though President Obama's promised withdrawal plans begins in July, U.S. soldiers are reporting more intense fighting.
Already, politicians and military generals are desperately redefining withdrawal plans, claiming they are contingent on security. They have predicted that the Spring Offensive will spill over into the Summer, and that battles and violence will increase. U.S. and NATO troops are also expecting Afghan insurgents to broaden their offensive in trying to regain lost territory in Kandahar and Helmand.
In many ways, the U.S.-led Vietnam and Afghan wars are different. But in some ways they are similar. After ten years of fighting and hearing about progress, war continues. Afghan insurgents are still able to launch coordinated attacks, and U.S. and NATO soldiers are still dying. The cost of America's Afghanistan Experience is draining the U.S. economy. Like Vietnam, corruption in armaments industries continues to increase.
Horrendous atrocities against innocent civilians are also being committed on both sides. America's enemy is still underestimated, its strategies are still in question, and military data-body counts-still flawed. Just as tragic, though, is the belief that things are going so well that one should not think or believe otherwise. In such a state of abject denial and contradiction, more futile sacrifices will be made.
Perhaps the real light at the end of the tunnel, at least for the United States, should have been the realization that not every war is winnable and not every military mission can be achieved. Beliefs should always be questioned and challenged. Discussions about past and present wars, including their differences and comparisons, should be heard. One must wonder if light will ever shine in America's tunnel vision of war and militarism.

Some people seem to have trouble in enabling SSL in Prestashop, especially when they have custom themes. Let's see how to do it properly, and eventually debug a couple of errors.
Some words about SSL
If you don't know what SSL is, or have heard about but don't grasp the concept, here it is: SSL is a cryptographic protocol, that basically secures data sent across pages with a cryptographic key. It's basically used to secure credit card transactions, and sensible data like login details, or personal information. In Prestashop, the back office login, front office account pages and orders can be secured with SSL by default. Of course, you can secure other pages if you want, but this is beyond the scope of the quick tip.
Get your certificate first!
Before even thinking on implementing SSL in Prestashop, you must buy an SSL Certificate. It doesn't come for free in any hosting plan I know, and it has to be bought separately for each domain. This means that if you have myshoes.com, and myshoes.net, 2 SSL Certificates will be needed. Most hosting providers also require you to buy an additional dedicated IP address. Let's see how to buy an SSL Certificate with a popular and affordable hosting: Arvixe.com.
Setting up an SSL Certificate with Arvixe
I'm using Arvixe, but most of the providers offer about the same way to get an SSL certificate. I'll also assume your already have a domain, without the SSL Certificate.
First, login to your Arvixe account, and navigate to the Support Center. In the knowledgebase section, you'll find a link for SSL, with any additional information you may need. You can ask the certificate in many ways: using the live chat (just below Knlowledgebase), sending and email at ssl@arvixe.com, or opening a ticket. The important thing is that you provide the following information:
Arvixe Username
Host to make cert for: (usually domain.com or www.domain.com)
City:
State:
Country (2 letter abbreviation):
Company Name:
Company Division:
As they state in the knowledgebase, if you already have your own certificate, they'll install that for FREE.
As for their pricing, the SSL itself is $25.95/year, plus 2 additional bucks per month for the dedicated IP.
Check that the certificate is working
After some time (usually, a couple of days) you'll receive confirmation of the successful installation of your certificate. it's time to test it out. Login to your prestashop admin panel, and navigate to Preferences -> General.. The very first option will allow you to test out your new SSL certificate:
Click on Please click here to use HTTPS protocol before enabling SSL.
If everything works out correctly, after the page refreshes your address bar will have https:// at the beginning, with a padlock right in front:
If, for some reason, you can't access the page (Internal Server Error 500, 404 not found, 102 (net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED) or anything else) your SSL certificate is not seup correctly. If this happens contact your hosting immediately, since you can't do anything about it.

Troubleshooting
At this point, your content should be secured. Access an account page, and try placing an order in your Prestashop front-office. You should get the https:// prefix for the url.
But this might not happen at times, even though the secure link was okay for your admin page. If you get some new 404, 500, or 102 errors, the only option is to contact the hosting. Let them also know if you use Pretty URLs, as this might conflict at times. A bunch of other issues can be solved anyway.
The page at http://mysitesname.com ran insecure content from http://anotherpage.com/file.ext
This usually happens if some files required in the page are not properly embedded. Most of the time, when you use a custom theme. If you run into this, take note of the file that is being embedded and try to locate it in the html structure. It usually is a javascript, stylesheet of image type file. If you use addthis, for example, you'll need to include a secured version of their javascript to avoid this error.
If your theme has a slider, you will need to change the prifix for those.
In all cases, when you use SSL, your image/stylesheets/javascripts references MUST begin with {$base_dir_ssl}.
I can't access my site (back nor front office) anymore!
Your server's SSL settings might be wrong. In this case, you must force Prestashop not to use SSL. Login to your phpMyAdmin (or any other database manager). Access the configuration table, and locate PS_SSL_ENABLED. It should be set to 1, crush it to zero. This way, you'll be able to access your site again, but of course you'll have no SSL. Be sure you further investigate the issue, before trying to turn it on again!
The world first publication of a previously unknown work by J.R.R. Tolkien, The Story of Kullervo (16.07.15 by Pieter Collier) - Comments
HarperCollins have officially announced the world first publication of a previously unknown work of fantasy by J.R.R. Tolkien, which tells the powerful story of a doomed young man who is sold into slavery and who swears revenge on the magician who killed his father.
J.R.R. Tolkien's The Story of Kullervo will be released in an edition edited by Verlyn Flieger on 27th August this year.
“The Story of Kullervo” was written by Tolkien in 1914 and was his own reworking and re-imagining of part of the tale of the Finnish saga Kalevala. The story is significant in the development of Tolkien's legendarium as it provided the basis for Túrin Turambar, a tragic hero of The Silmarillion and The Children of Húrin. The Story of Kullervo was written when Tolkien was at Oxford at age 22, though it was never completed. It was his first piece of prose fiction.
Verlyn Flieger, who has also edited Smith of Wootton Major and Tolkien On Fairy-stories, first published “The Story of Kullervo” in 2010 in Tolkien Studies: Volume 7. This expanded edition, available in hardback on the 27th August, follows the similar publications of The Fall of Arthur and The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún.
The Story of Kullervo, which is only a few thousand words long, will be brought out this August by HarperCollins. The cover features one of Tolkienâs own illustrations.
John Garth, a Tolkien biographer, was quoted as saying, “It's a very important and significant book, but more for being vital in Tolkien's development as a writer. Most crucially, it led to his Elvish languages for Middle-earth. So this book is key to him inventing languages of his own for later works. But, interestingly, he deliberately never completed it. He just knew he could write, but wanted to move on.”
Kullervo son of Kalervo is perhaps the darkest and most tragic of all J.R.R. Tolkien's characters. ‘Hapless Kullervo', as Tolkien called him, is a luckless orphan boy with supernatural powers and a tragic destiny.
Brought up in the homestead of the dark magician Untamo, who killed his father, kidnapped his mother, and who tries three times to kill him when still a boy, Kullervo is alone save for the love of his twin sister, Wanona, and guarded by the magical powers of the black dog, Musti. When Kullervo is sold into slavery he swears revenge on the magician, but he will learn that even at the point of vengeance there is no escape from the cruellest of fates.
Tolkien himself said that The Story of Kullervo was ‘the germ of my attempt to write legends of my own', and was ‘a major matter in the legends of the First Age'. Tolkien's Kullervo is the clear ancestor of Túrin Turambar, tragic incestuous hero of The Silmarillion. In addition to it being a powerful story in its own right, The Story of Kullervo – published here for the first time with the author's drafts, notes and lecture-essays on its source-work, The Kalevala – is a foundation stone in the structure of Tolkien's invented world.

It is no accident that eight Palestinian neighborhoods of Jerusalem wound up beyond the separation barrier. Since annexing Jerusalem in 1967, Israel has manipulated migratory trends toward an unstated goal: absorbing the land without the people.
By Betty Herschman
There are many ways to test the notion of Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel. One could do a comparative analysis of how much the municipality invests in East and West Jerusalem — roughly 1:9. One could drive up the road that neatly divides the bougainvillea draped neighborhood/settlement of East Talpiot and Palestinian Jabal Mukaber, a model of a neighborhood excluded from the city planning process; or consider that Palestinians, nearly 40 percent of the population of the city, are second-class residents denied the right to vote in national elections. For absolute clarity, one need only look at the eight Jerusalem neighborhoods that are located squarely within the municipal borders…but relegated to the other side of the separation barrier.
Findings from Ir Amim's comprehensive new report, “Displaced in their Own City,” reveal that at least 80,000 and possibly more than 100,000 Palestinians — between one-fourth to one-third of the entire Palestinian population of Jerusalem, linked to the city for generations by ties of family, livelihood, economics, identity, culture, and religion — now live in these abandoned enclaves. The area of Kufr Aqab and Semiramis as well as the Shuafat refugee camp, including the neighborhoods of Ras Khamis, Ras Shehadeh, and Dahiyat al-Salaam, are totally, indisputably divided from Jerusalem by a concrete wall and checkpoints, as well as the municipality's near complete abdication of responsibility for providing basic services, safety oversight and law enforcement.
Read the full report: Displaced in their Own City
From afar, these neighborhoods appear to be thriving; one sees a skyline of new development and ambitious construction rather than a sprawling, dilapidated favela. But zoom in and one sees that buildings are being erected within several meters of one another, with no municipal oversight to ensure basic engineering and safety standards. UNRWA's project director in the Shuafat refugee camp estimates that in the event of an earthquake some 80 percent of the buildings around the earthquake-vulnerable camp will collapse. Miles of roads across the eight neighborhoods are unpaved, posing a severe health and safety hazard. In some places, sewage flows freely in the streets. There is an intolerable dearth of schools and health care services, a particularly acute problem given that Israeli ambulances will not enter the neighborhoods, requiring Palestinian ambulances to meet them at checkpoints for transfer to hospital. Delays can be fatal.
What is more shocking than the devastation itself is the realization that the neighborhoods beyond the barrier are not accidental; they are the creation of policies which, since the annexation of Jerusalem in 1967, have manipulated migratory trends toward an unstated goal: absorbing the land without the people. Israeli policy has sought to maintain territorial control over East Jerusalem and to ensure a substantial Jewish majority in the city: first, through the expropriation of one-third of Palestinian land for Israeli use and second, through the denial of Palestinian individual and collective rights (i.e. denial of full civil status and attendant social and political rights). Building on that foundation, in 2004 Israel began constructing a separation barrier around Jerusalem, ostensibly designed to serve as a security buffer. In fact, it delineated a political boundary to Jerusalem that sought to ensure a firm Jewish majority and full territorial control of the city and surrounding areas, conveniently excising eight Palestinian neighborhoods in the process.
These neighborhoods are an extreme mirror of Israeli policy in East Jerusalem, a pillar of which is Palestinians' near complete exclusion from the planning process — and access to building permits — and the maintenance of gross socio-economic disparities to which the barrier has been a primary contributor. For the poorest of the poor (the overall poverty rate in East Jerusalem is 75.4 percent), the push-pull dynamic of housing within the barrier in East Jerusalem being cost prohibitive and the availability of more affordable albeit unsafe alternatives beyond the barrier — due to the Municipality's disinterest — amounts to nothing less than the “silent transfer” of Palestinians to the outer perimeter of the city.
As a possible harbinger of Israel's ultimate intentions, in 2006 security responsibility in the Kufr Aqab-Semiramis area was transferred from the Police to the Military (the IDF's Binyamin Brigade), effectively converting civilians into subjects of a military administration. Justified by statements from various political figures, one must ask if these steps indicate intentions to relinquish the land as a trade for not locating a future Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem — in other words, unilaterally dividing Jerusalem without addressing the Historic Basin, the very heart of a political resolution on the city. Until such a resolution is reached, and so long as Israel maintains its control over East Jerusalem, the Israeli government and the Jerusalem Municipality will continue to bear responsibility for the fate of the residents of the eight neighborhoods beyond the barrier. Failure to take action will further undermine the stability of Palestinian life in Jerusalem, the democratic foundations of Israeli society and any future political resolution on the city.

What's Next For The Founder Of The Slants, And The Fight Over Racial Slurs
Enlarge this image toggle caption Ariel Zambelich/NPR Ariel Zambelich/NPR
On a Monday morning in June, Simon Tam woke up at his home in Portland, Ore., to 753 notifications blowing up his phone.
"At that point, I knew something had happened," Tam said. The Supreme Court had finally resolved his nearly eight year fight with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office over the name of his band, The Slants.
The justices ruled, unanimously to strike the section of a federal trademark law that prohibited the use of disparaging and offensive terms. The trademark office had cited part of a 71-year-old trademark law, Section 2A of the Lanham Act, when it prohibited Tam from registering The Slants, a slur against Asians, as the name of the band.
The Court's ruling agreed with Tam and the other band members that the law had infringed on their free speech. But in the process, The Slants case had opened up a whole can of worms involving other offensive or racist terms, most notably the debate over the Washington Redskins. The team's owner, Dan Snyder, said in a statement that he was "thrilled" with the decision.
And sure enough, the football team has since won its own trademark fight. A group of Native American activists led by Amanda Blackhorse, along with the Department of Justice, gave up their longstanding court efforts to ban the team from using that name.
Which was something Simon Tam and his band mates never anticipated when they formed their Asian-American rock group more than a decade before.
[After this episode aired, Simon Tam responded in an open letter, writing:
"To start, I want to be expressly clear: we don't have different values. We both care deeply about the most marginalized members of our society, we want to address systemic and institutional challenges faced by people of color, and we want to be intentional and equitable about the process. Where we differ is on our respective theories of change, direct experiences with challenges in this system, and understandings of how the law has worked (and hasn't). I'm hoping that through thoughtful engagement, we can address some of the latter so that we can be better partners in advancing justice."
Read the full text of his letter here.]
Tam says that when he was coming up with a name, he turned to friends for suggestions. "I would say things like, 'What's a common stereotype? What do you think all Asians have in common?' And the first response that I got was, 'Oh, slanted eyes.' "
Tam said he thought "The Slants" sounded like a New Wave band. He also liked the dual purpose of reclaiming a slur, and referring to their "slant" on life.
Their long legal struggle officially began in 2010. Tam had learned that some of the band's fans had incorrectly bought tickets for another rock group called The Slants, so Tam applied for a trademark registration. The trademark office rejected the application. The logic? Because the band had Asian-American members, its name was disparaging, thus violating Section 2A of the Lanham Act.
Tam has long had to reconcile his battle over The Slants with that of the Washington football team. And that connection has made him a divisive figure within civil rights legal organizations. While he garnered support from many different organizations — including the CATO Institute, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Asian American Legal Defense And Education Fund — other groups, including the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association and Asian Americans Advancing Justice, were split.
As for Tam himself, on the day of the huge ruling he found himself in his back yard in Portland, mowing the lawn. He says it was the first moment he'd had to himself all day, and he found himself crying as the impact of the decision settled in.
He couldn't stop thinking about "the people who were vehemently opposed to our case. And I thought in many ways they're right. And then I thought about the people who struggled against the law. ... I thought, we're right, too."
He says he wishes there were more room in the law for nuance. But when decisions like this are put in the hands of officials without any cultural competency, he adds, "ultimately at the end of the day we'll end up losing again and again."
Still, Tam says he's hoping to use his band's social media platform to support Native Americans in their fight.
"I definitely feel empathy and sorrow that they're feeling pain," Tam says. "Some of them might feel very setback in their particular fights and struggles as well."
In a joint statement after the Supreme Court ruling, two prominent Native American groups, Change The Mascot and the National Congress of American Indians, sought to make the best of it. They announced that, while they were displeased with the decision, they were "gratified that this Supreme Court case amplified the intensifying public debate over the NFL's support for bigotry against Native Americans."
The groups added that their fight with the Washington football team was "an issue we have always believed will not be solved in a courtroom."
"What's right is not always a legal question," says Ray Halbritter, Representative of the Oneida Indian Nation and the founder of Change the Mascot. "What is right here, is to not be using an offensive or racial slur."
The advocacy organization Asian Americans Advancing Justice
AAJC, which was initially somewhat neutral, has now taken a more hard-line stance against The Slants.
"From our perspective, the court oversimplified what really is a little bit more nuanced analysis," said John Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice
AAJC. "The bottom line is... that this case allows organizations or individuals to profit from using a racial slur or disparaging term."

We get it, indie developers, you think religion is bad. Has there ever been a videogame faith that didn't eventually boil down to evil murder zealots? Hell, even the Chantry of Dragon Age couldn't go more than a game before it started lobotomizing mages and resurrecting ancient corrupted Darkspawn lords. Can't we just have a game where someone joins the local temple, finds a general sense of purpose and community, and is overall a little bit better off for it?
Yeah I know, it's a lame start. A lame start to a lame review about a lame game. I considered prefacing this all on a sympathetic note, expressing understanding for how hard it is to make a good indie game. And a FPS nonetheless! Those are like, some of the hardest games to make. What with all the modeling and AI and making sure your characters don't get stuck in walls and walk like they are sliding along an invisible conveyor belt. Missing just one of those things can make the whole game suck! In the case of Inner Chains, it is missing several.
Taking the time to bash on everything that Inner Chains does wrong would take infinitely longer than to list what it does right, so I'll start with the good. First off, the world of Inner Chains is visually striking. It's a discordant mash of colliding worlds that has grown into a single entity. Straight out of the notebooks of Giger, the gnarled and twisting hallways are a mix of manufactured logic and organic mayhem. The biomechanical machinery and weapons always skirt a fine line between horror and logic, making just enough sense be that much more grotesque.
And that is the limit of the empirically good. Every other positive element is so heavily interwoven with the bad that it's impossible to talk about them without a huge asterisk. So with a big asterisk over this whole paragraph, I actually kind of dug the storytelling. Aside from a robust opening cutscene, the game has no spoken dialogue. It's all told visually, through a combination of spectated events and captioned paintings. Now this is different from the typical text log collection, as you initially don't speak the language. Over the course of the game you have the option to hunt down a number of tablets that translate specific letters, teaching you to spell like a “Sesame Street” episode from Silent Hill's dark world. As it all comes together, the gibberish becomes a progressively more gruesome tale of religion gone mad. The text isn't readable for a majority of the game, meaning there is a purpose to a second playthrough that the gameplay would otherwise not demand.
It would all be super cool if the story itself were sensical/any good. Having gone through and read all of the text for funzies, I can safely say that most of it is your standard anti-religious counterculture triviality. I get it, many religions throughout most history have disenfranchised women. What does this have to do with the doom spires in the distance ripping apart the earth? I don't know. The most interesting elements of the world are never explained. I'm sure that they were going for a Dark Souls minimalist vibe, telling a story through slight clues that I'm supposed to glue together. What Dark Souls did right was draw me in enough to pull it all together. Inner Chains does not.
I mentioned briefly that Inner Chains is an FPS, but only because it is a first person game where you shoot. With three guns and little tactical decision making, it's the bare minimum to pass. Of the three flavors of firearms, you get blue, red, and green corresponding to a predictable element: blue for lightning, red for fire, and green for… bullets? I guess they are more of spikes, so maybe bio-bullets? In theory, each gun serves a purpose beyond just dealing damage. The lightning gun can momentarily stun enemies and environmental hazards, the fire gun consumes a lot of ammo but clears obstacles permanently, and the bullets are bullets.
It's supposed to all come together in a way that makes you utilize the environment to gain a combat advantage. There are a number of non-sapient “creatures” littered about, that function as traps you can either spend ammo to eliminate or carefully avoid. It boils down to either things you can shoot to hurt stuff around it, or things you can lure enemies into. There isn't a great variety—as I write this the stationary tentacle and the ceiling mounted “barnacle” are the only ones that immediately come to mind—and I rarely found using them to be any more effective than just shooting things.
The game tries to up the difficulty with a limited ammo supply that can only be refilled at specific tentacle molestation stations. Each station only has a certain amount of juice, which is split between reloading your gun and your health. The stations also correspond to a certain color of gun, so red stations will give you more fire and green give you more bullets. However, the big flaw with this is that your fire gun both deals the most damage and will use health instead of ammo if it runs out. As soon as I figured this out, every station became a fire station, and combat a joke.
So why can't they just use normal reloading and ammo boxes? Because this is horror, dammit! Everything has to be gross! Weird troglodyte midgets with lamps for balls are your checkpoints, glowing plants that fart a cloud of black dust are your waypoints, and a facehugger plant shows you different secrets. It's all pretty cool in concept, but the insipid combat and rudimentary level design make it all pointless. So I interact with the makeout plant, and it shows me a distant alcove with a new letter and ammo station in it. Do the fart-flowers now lead me to that location? Nope! Not to worry, though. None of the level is complicated enough that you won't be able to find everything without a little legwork. That is, assuming you don't mistakenly go left instead of right and block yourself off from the rest of the level. Oops, guess you have to start over!
This is all just an insane amount of nitpicking when compared to the massive glaring issues. The game is only about two and a half hours long over four levels, each of which I could point out one of several game ruining flaws. As I said before, the game has no dialogue, but aside from a few whispers here and there in cutscenes, the people are completely silent. There was a part early on where a horde of writhing wretches was kneeling before a figure preaching from a pedestal, and not a sound was made by any of them. It was horribly awkward. I'm watching these battered souls squirm on the floor, and they are all completely silent. Jesus, I never thought I'd be begging for anguished cries.
The combat also suffers from the nonexistent AI. I expect zombies to shamble towards me, but the human enemies with guns do the exact same thing. They run into range, shoot their gun, and occasionally try to punch me. The stun gun actually doesn't even stun these enemies, making combat just a matter of what color you feel like spraying them with. Combined with the horribly slow walking speed and a sprint time that makes me assume my character has been a chronic smoker for the past 40 years, the game is a chore to play.
At a $20 asking price, there is no possible way I can recommend Inner Chains. There are charming things about it, but it falls below even the standards of a good Half-Life 2 mod. I appreciate that the making of the art assets probably took a long time, and they are just trying to recoup their costs. As a consumer, there's no way that this is worth it. If it drops on sale to below $5, it's worth checking out the more interesting elements piled beneath the crap. Otherwise, give Inner Chains a pass.
We noted with interest reports that subsidiaries of foreign corporations from across the globe have launched a lobbying campaign in Washington to protect their newfound power to influence American elections under the Citizens United case. About 160 of these U.S. subsidiaries of foreign-owned or controlled corporations are involved in a lobbying group trying to stop President Obama and Congress from enacting limits on their spending in political campaigns. Worse still, the lobbyist leading the effort refused to disclose all the companies involved in the lobbying campaign. But it appears that the group of companies has the potential to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to influence American elections.
All of this demonstrates why the President was right to criticize the Supreme Court's recent decision in Citizens United – and why he is also right to call for reform of the lobbying laws, including tough new rules on lobbyist disclosure, that build on the dramatic steps he has already taken in his first year in office to change Washington.
In Citizens United, a narrow 5-4 majority of the Supreme Court overturned a century of law that had barred corporations from using their financial clout to directly interfere with elections. As a result of this decision, American corporations owned in whole or in part by foreign companies—and even by foreign governments—are no longer restricted from making expenditures to elect or defeat federal candidates.
Some have argued that Citizens United will not increase foreign influence, but they are mistaken. The four Justice dissent, authored by Justice Stevens, specifically pinpoints the fact that the majority opinion opens the door to foreign influence -- see page 33 and page 75. The majority openly acknowledged that foreign influence could pose a potential issue here, as did the lawyer for Citizens United. And, a stream of independent, non-partisan experts have echoed the President's concerns:
Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21 stated that “there is no statutory prohibition against foreign-controlled domestic corporations from making expenditures to influence federal elections, following the Citizens United decision.”
Common Cause and Public Campaign issued a joint statement that the Court's opinion “will allow corporations, including those owned by a majority of foreign entities, to spend without limit to influence US elections.”
Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute stated that: “Citizens United opens up opportunities for American subsidiaries of foreign companies, including those owned by foreign governments, to spend huge amounts to influence American elections.”
Gerald Hebert of the Campaign Legal Center stated that “With the corporate campaign expenditure ban now being declared unconstitutional, domestic corporations controlled by foreign governments or other foreign entities are free to spend money to elect or defeat federal candidates.”
Others assert that subsidiaries of foreign companies already spend millions on independent expenditures and so the Citizens United decision will make no difference. That misses the point. The electioneering communications law that was struck down restricted corporate ads naming elected officials in the crucial 60 days before general elections and 30 days before primary elections. Now those corporations can spend freely on those ads during the most critical periods in elections and the express message can be to vote for or against a named candidate. That constitutes an enormous expansion of corporate power to influence elections.
Others claim existing law is sufficient to protect against foreign influence in our elections. That too is wrong. Although the Federal Election Commission (FEC) restricts foreign nationals from spending or directing spending in American elections, it does not prohibit corporations in which foreign nationals are shareholders or hold significant sway or de facto control from making such expenditures . For example, foreign-controlled corporations making independent expenditures cannot be relied upon to make decisions contrary to the political interests or preferences of their owners. Before Citizens United, these problems did not exist at the federal level since the corporations themselves were limited in what they could do regardless of whose money or influence was behind them. But now that restriction is no more. Accordingly, because of these realities of how foreign control can operate, a stronger rule is needed to protect our domestic politics from foreign influence.
In the State of the Union, the President called for a series of steps to fix the problems caused by this case and also by the problem of special interests and their lobbyists having too much influence in Washington. In addition to closing the loopholes opened by Citizens United, including the one that could allow foreign interests to influence our elections, the President also called on Congress to:
Establish carefully-tailored, low-dollar limits on the contributions lobbyists may bundle or make to candidates for federal office;
Toughen lobbyist disclosure rules so that – like the voluntary step the President has taken to disclose visitors to the White House – lobbyists must disclose the details of every lobbying contact, including what the meeting was about;
Close the loophole that allows foreign agent lobbyists to avoid full disclosure of their activities;
Fully disclose all earmark requests on a comprehensive, bipartisan, state-of-the-art disclosure database that allows Americans to examine the details of every proposed request.
The proposals are detailed in this White House fact sheet.
For at least a century, it was considered perfectly legal to treat corporations differently than people in the context of political activity. The Supreme Court's decision changes that century-old legal principle. As Justice Stevens wrote in dissent, “Congress has placed special limitations on campaign spending by corporations ever since the passage of the Tillman Act in 1907... The Court today rejects a century of history when it treats the distinction between corporate and individual campaign spending as an invidious novelty born of [more recent Court decisions].”
The American people have a compelling interest in preventing foreign interests from influencing our domestic political process. A strong legislative response is required given the stakes: Americans' control over their own electoral process. That is why the President is working with Congressional leadership to move rapidly to pass legislation that protects our politics from undue special interest influence.

TORONTO, ONTARIO, Sep 15, 2014 (Marketwired via COMTEX) -- A new Ivey Business School study reveals that mobile and at-home workers are just as productive as their office-based colleagues - and they're happier. The study, conducted with TELUS, found that mobile and home-based workers experienced better work-life balance and were less inclined to leave their jobs.
The year-long study surveyed more than 2,000 knowledge workers and their managers at TELUS between February 2013 and February 2014 and had the following key findings:
-- Mobile and at-home workers reported better work-life balance. -- 98 per cent of mobile workers and 99 per cent of at-home workers reported low to moderate impact of work duties on their home and family life, compared to 71 per cent of resident workers. -- Mobile and at-home workers demonstrated increased loyalty. -- 100 per cent of mobile and at-home workers were considered low-risk of leaving TELUS. -- Mobile and at-home workers were considered equally productive as their resident colleagues. -- Leaders showed no differences in their ratings of productivity or performance of mobile, at-home and resident workers.
As an increasing number of millennials enter the workplace and advances in mobile technology allow workers to be connected anytime, anywhere, flexible working programs are a growing trend that Canadian businesses can't ignore. A 2013 study by Price Waterhouse Coopers found that more than 60 per cent of their workforce wanted a flexible working environment, and a 2013 IDC study predicted that 73 per cent of Canada's workforce will be mobile by 2016.
TELUS implemented its flexible working program "Work Styles" in 2006. Not only has Work Styles played a key role in attracting and retaining top talent, but it has also driven increased team member engagement. Over the past seven years, TELUS has seen its employee engagement scores rise from 53 per cent to 83 per cent - the highest score worldwide for a company of its size and workforce mix according to global HR organization Aon Hewitt. Engagement scores for mobile and at-home team members are even higher at 84 per cent and 85 per cent respectively.
TELUS' Work Styles also delivers economic and environmental benefits. Since launching the program, TELUS has reduced its real estate footprint by more than one million square feet, and by investing in collaborative technology TELUS has cut travel costs by more than $14 million and achieved a 22 per cent reduction in carbon emissions. Last year, Work Styles eliminated more than 19 million kilometers and 1.1 million hours of commuting by TELUS team members.
"Work Styles provides our team with the tools, resources and support they need to work when and where they're most productive," said Andrea Goertz, Senior Vice President, Strategic Initiatives and Chief Communications and Sustainability Officer at TELUS. "We've witnessed the success of the program first-hand and the Ivey study confirms our belief that a flexible working program delivers substantial cultural, economic and environmental benefits to an organization."
"With Work Styles, TELUS team members maintained their performance, exhibited increased loyalty, and experienced lower stress and less family/job conflict," said Alison Konrad, a Professor of Organizational Behaviour at the Ivey Business School, who co-authored the study. "But it also found that issues like professional isolation and perceptions of fairness can arise in the absence of strong leadership."
In TELUS' experience, successfully implementing a flexible working program requires a multifaceted approach that combines technology, strong support from senior leadership and a comprehensive change management plan. Mobile technology (smartphones, tablets and internet sticks), collaboration tools (voice and video conferencing, instant messaging and document sharing), and cloud-based applications and storage accessible from any device lay the foundation; but an organization's leaders must be committed to driving a large-scale cultural shift.
"Implementing a flexible work program requires an organization to step into unfamiliar territory - there are behaviours to change, management styles to reshape and new cultural norms to establish," said Goertz. "However, when embraced by leaders and supported by the right technology, these programs offer tremendous benefits for both team members and employers."
With seven years of experience championing a flexible work program, TELUS now guides other organizations in successfully shifting to a flexible working model. Earlier this year, the company created TELUS Transformation Office, a future-of-work consulting practice that leverages TELUS' first-hand experience to help organizations transform their cultures through best practices in engagement and technology.

[Updated on October 7, 2017] This updated tutorial using the latest Ionic-Angular 3.7.1 and Angular 4.3 HttpClient features for building Ionic 3 and Angular 4 mobile app from scratch. The following tools, module, and dependencies are required to achieve the goals of this Ionic 3 and Angular 4 tutorial:
- Node.js (Stable or recommended version)
- The Latest Ionic 3, Angular 4 and Cordova
- Terminal or (Node.js) Command Line
- Text Editor or IDE
- Android or iOS device (If necessary)
We assume that you have installed Node.js and able to run `npm` in Node.js command line (Windows) or Terminal (OS X/Linux). To make sure everything is up to date, type this command in the terminal or Node command line.
Or if using OS X terminal.
sudo npm install -g [email protected]
Check Ionic version and it's environment.
ionic info
And here's production ready and stable configuration.
cli packages: (/usr/local/lib/node_modules) @ionic/cli-utils : 1.12.0 ionic (Ionic CLI) : 3.12.0 System: Node : v6.9.4 npm : 3.10.10 OS : macOS Sierra Misc: backend : legacy
1. Create a new Ionic 3 and Angular 4 App
Go to your projects folder then type this command to create a new Ionic 3 and Angular 4 initial app.
ionic start new-ionic3-angular4 tabs
That command will create Ionic 3 and Angular 4 app with the name `new-ionic3-angular4` and use tabs template. Now, open the newly created project folder in your IDE or Text Editor then open `package.json` to see the default installed package for building the Ionic 3 and Angular 4 app. It looks like this.
"dependencies": { "@angular/common": "4.4.3", "@angular/compiler": "4.4.3", "@angular/compiler-cli": "4.4.3", "@angular/core": "4.4.3", "@angular/forms": "4.4.3", "@angular/http": "4.4.3", "@angular/platform-browser": "4.4.3", "@angular/platform-browser-dynamic": "4.4.3", "@ionic-native/core": "4.3.0", "@ionic-native/splash-screen": "4.3.0", "@ionic-native/status-bar": "4.3.0", "@ionic/storage": "2.0.1", "ionic-angular": "3.7.1", "ionicons": "3.0.0", "rxjs": "5.4.3", "sw-toolbox": "3.6.0", "zone.js": "0.8.18" }, "devDependencies": { "@ionic/app-scripts": "3.0.0", "typescript": "2.3.4" },
Next, go to the newly created folder from terminal or command line.
cd ./new-ionic3-angular4
For the first time, run your Ionic 3 and Angular 4 app by typing this command.
ionic serve -l
That command will automatically open default browser and go to the default Ionic 3 app page, you can expand platforms and choose your desired platform.
2. Create Ionic 3 Service
To access or consume RESTful Web Service, we create Ionic 3 service to hold the related functions. Here we will implement the new Angular 4.3 HttpClient than bundle with Angular Common library. Type this command for creating Ionic service or provider, but first, close the running app by press `ctrl+c` key.
ionic g provider rest
Now, open and edit `src/providers/rest/rest.ts` then replace default `http` imports and add other imports.
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http'; import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable'; import 'rxjs/add/operator/catch';
Also, replace 'Http' injection in the constructor.
constructor(public http: HttpClient) { console.log('Hello RestProvider Provider'); }
Declare URL string variable below class name.
private apiUrl = 'https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all';
We will use free RESTful web service for getting countries. Now, create this function below the constructor.
getCountries(): Observable<string[]> { return this.http.get(this.apiUrl) .map(this.extractData) .catch(this.handleError); } private extractData(res: Response) { let body = res; return body || { }; } private handleError (error: Response | any) { let errMsg: string; if (error instanceof Response) { const err = error || ''; errMsg = `${error.status} - ${error.statusText || ''} ${err}`; } else { errMsg = error.message ? error.message : error.toString(); } console.error(errMsg); return Observable.throw(errMsg); }
3. Modify Existing Home Page
Now, it's a time to display country list on the Home page. First, we have to modify "src/pages/home/home.ts" replace all codes with this.
import { Component } from '@angular/core'; import { NavController } from 'ionic-angular'; import { RestProvider } from '../../providers/rest/rest'; @Component({ selector: 'page-home', templateUrl: 'home.html' }) export class HomePage { countries: string[]; errorMessage: string; constructor(public navCtrl: NavController, public rest: RestProvider) { } ionViewDidLoad() { this.getCountries(); } getCountries() { this.rest.getCountries() .subscribe( countries => this.countries = countries, error => this.errorMessage = <any>error); } }
Next, open and edit "src/pages/home/home.html" then replace all tags inside `<ionic-content>` tag with this.
<ion-content padding> <ion-list> <ion-item *ngFor="let c of countries"> <ion-avatar item-left> <img src="{{c.flag}}"> </ion-avatar> <h2>{{c.name}}</h2> <p>Capital: {{c.capital}}, Region: {{c.region}}</p> </ion-item> </ion-list> </ion-content>
That it's, our simple Ionic 3 and Angular 4 app is ready to run.
4. Run the App in Browser and Devices
To test in the browser, run again this command.
ionic serve -l
You will see Ionic 3 and Angular 4 app on the browser show country list.
To test on Android or iOS device, first, update Cordova to the latest version.
sudo npm install -g cordova
Now, remove default generated platform.
ionic cordova rm android ionic cordova add android ionic cordova rm ios ionic cordova add ios
To run on the Android.
ionic cordova run android --prod
To run on the iOS device.
ionic cordova run ios --prod
We know that building beautifully designed Ionic apps from scratch can be frustrating and very time-consuming. Check Ion2FullApp ELITE - The Complete Ionic 3 Starter App and save development and design time.
That just the basic. If you need more deep learning about Ionic, Angular, and Typescript, you can find the following books:
Or take the following course:
[Original Article, April 2017]
This tutorial shows you how to build Ionic 3 and Angular 4 mobile app in step-by-step example with pages lazy loading. The Ionic 3 is still beta and it launches a few days ago. For that, we do not yet recommend using this beta version in production or published app. Before we started, there is some checklist should be done.
- Node.js already installed with Node.js command prompt on Windows.
- Update Ionic to the latest version using this command.
or
sudo npm install -g [email protected]
- Check Ionic version and it's environment.
ionic info
If you create Ionic 3 app from an earlier version you will ask a question below just click Enter.
Looks like this is an Ionic Angular project, would you like to install @ionic/cli-plug in-ionic-angular and continue? Yes
The result will be like this.
global packages: @ionic/cli-utils : 1.4.0 Ionic CLI : 3.4.0 local packages: @ionic/app-scripts : 1.3.1 @ionic/cli-plugin-ionic-angular : 1.3.1 Ionic Framework : ionic-angular 3.0.1 System: Node : v6.9.4 OS : OS X El Capitan Xcode : Xcode 8.0 Build version 8A218a ios-deploy : 1.9.0 ios-sim : 5.0.12 npm : 3.10.10
As usual, we start the tutorial from scratch. We will build Ionic 3 app that shows the list of countries taken from REST API. We will be using this API from REST Countries.
1. Create Ionic 3 App
Still the same as previous version of Ionic. Type this command to create new Ionic 3 App.
ionic start ionic3-angular4 tabs
In the previous version the command still uses "--v2" prefix, but with the latest version just like above command. It will automatically run "npm install" and will take some minutes to finish.
"dependencies": { "@angular/common": "4.1.3", "@angular/compiler": "4.1.3", "@angular/compiler-cli": "4.1.3", "@angular/core": "4.1.3", "@angular/forms": "4.1.3", "@angular/http": "4.1.3", "@angular/platform-browser": "4.1.3", "@angular/platform-browser-dynamic": "4.1.3", "@ionic-native/core": "3.12.1", "@ionic-native/splash-screen": "3.12.1", "@ionic-native/status-bar": "3.12.1", "@ionic/storage": "2.0.1", "ionic-angular": "3.5.0", "ionicons": "3.0.0", "rxjs": "5.4.0", "sw-toolbox": "3.6.0", "zone.js": "0.8.12" },
Now, run it on the browser after type this command.
ionic serve --lab
You will see the new looks than the first version of Ionic 3.
2. Workaround for Pages Lazy Loading
Before we move forward, let's implement this Ionic 3 lazy loading guides. Begin with modify 'src/app/app.module.ts' remove all import, declarations and entry components of all pages. The file content should be like this now.
import { NgModule, ErrorHandler } from '@angular/core'; import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser'; import { IonicApp, IonicModule, IonicErrorHandler } from 'ionic-angular'; import { MyApp } from './app.component'; import { StatusBar } from '@ionic-native/status-bar'; import { SplashScreen } from '@ionic-native/splash-screen'; @NgModule({ declarations: [ MyApp ], imports: [ BrowserModule, IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp, { preloadModules: true }) ], bootstrap: [IonicApp], entryComponents: [ MyApp ], providers: [ StatusBar, SplashScreen, {provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: IonicErrorHandler} ] }) export class AppModule {}
Now, change add module file for each page. For example, the file name should be like this 'pages/home/home.modules.ts'. Then add this lines of codes.
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; import { HomePage} from './home'; import { IonicPageModule } from 'ionic-angular'; @NgModule({ declarations: [HomePage], imports: [IonicPageModule.forChild(HomePage)], entryComponents: [HomePage] }) export class HomePageModule { }
Next, we have to add import and annotation to current 'pages/home/home.ts'.
import { IonicPage } from 'ionic-angular'; ... @IonicPage() @Component({ selector: 'page-home', templateUrl: 'home.html' }) export class HomePage { ...
Do the same thing for another page give name following the class name of the page.
The last thing is to modify 'src/app/app.component.ts' by removing import to the page. Then change the reference to the page to be a string by adding a single quote.
Before:
rootPage:any = TabsPage;
After:
rootPage:any = 'TabsPage';
You should do the same way for calling the page from another page. For example, in the tabs page.
import { Component } from '@angular/core'; import { IonicPage } from 'ionic-angular'; @IonicPage() @Component({ templateUrl: 'tabs.html' }) export class TabsPage { tab1Root: string = 'HomePage'; tab2Root: string = 'AboutPage'; tab3Root: string = 'ContactPage'; constructor() { } }
3. Create Ionic 3 Service
For accessing REST API, we need to create Service or Provider by type this command.
ionic generate provider rest
Open and edit "src/providers/rest.ts" then add or change these imports.
import { Http, Response } from '@angular/http'; import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable'; import 'rxjs/add/operator/catch'; import 'rxjs/add/operator/map';
Declare URL string variable below class name.
private apiUrl = 'https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all';
Create this functions.
getCountries(): Observable<string[]> { return this.http.get(this.apiUrl) .map(this.extractData) .catch(this.handleError); } private extractData(res: Response) { let body = res.json(); return body || { }; } private handleError (error: Response | any) { let errMsg: string; if (error instanceof Response) { const body = error.json() || ''; const err = body.error || JSON.stringify(body); errMsg = `${error.status} - ${error.statusText || ''} ${err}`; } else { errMsg = error.message ? error.message : error.toString(); } console.error(errMsg); return Observable.throw(errMsg); }
We have to register "HttpModule" in "app.module.ts", add this import to "app.module.ts".
import { HttpModule } from '@angular/http';
In @NgModule imports, section adds "HttpModule" so it will look like this.
imports: [ BrowserModule, IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp), HttpModule ],
Still on "app.module.ts", register "Rest" Provider by import that provider first.
import { Rest } from '../providers/rest';
In @NgModule providers, section adds "Rest".
providers: [ StatusBar, SplashScreen, {provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: IonicErrorHandler}, Rest ]
4. Modify Existing Home Page
Now, it's a time to display country list on the Home page. First, we have to modify "src/pages/home/home.ts" replace all codes with this.
import { Component } from '@angular/core'; import { IonicPage } from 'ionic-angular'; import { NavController } from 'ionic-angular'; import { Rest } from '../../providers/rest'; @IonicPage() @Component({ selector: 'page-home', templateUrl: 'home.html' }) export class HomePage { countries: string[]; errorMessage: string; constructor(public navCtrl: NavController, public rest: Rest) { } ionViewDidLoad() { this.getCountries(); } getCountries() { this.rest.getCountries() .subscribe( countries => this.countries = countries, error => this.errorMessage = <any>error); } }
Next, open and edit "src/pages/home/home.html" then replace all tags with this.
<ion-header> <ion-navbar> <ion-title>Home</ion-title> </ion-navbar> </ion-header> <ion-content padding> <ion-list> <ion-item *ngFor="let c of countries"> <ion-avatar item-left> <img src="{{c.flag}}"> </ion-avatar> <h2>{{c.name}}</h2> <p>Capital: {{c.capital}}, Region: {{c.region}}</p> </ion-item> </ion-list> </ion-content>
That it's, our simple Ionic 3 and Angular 4 app is ready to run.
5. Run the App in Browser and Devices
Before running on real devices, first, run this app in the browser by type this command.
ionic serve --lab
You will see the list of the countries like below.
Now, on the real device, we have to modify default config.xml to make API calls without error. Add this preference.
<preference name="loadUrlTimeoutValue" value="700000" />
Next, we have to clean up default platform that generated when create Ionic 3 app.
ionic cordova platform rm ios ionic cordova platform add ios ionic cordova platform rm android ionic cordova platform add android
Connect your device to your computer. Run this command for Android device.
ionic cordova run android
And for iOS run this command.
ionic cordova run ios
You see this on Android and iOS devices.
6. Conclusion
We have done and run all steps in this tutorial smoothly. It seems no difference between Ionic 3 - Angular 4 and Ionic 2 - Angular 2. Maybe in the more complex mobile app, we will get significant improvement especially in the performance of Angular 4.
An event we do not recommend yet to build production mobile app, we still can try to build a simple mobile app for production. Until now, Ionic Framework team still working very hard to make this Ionic 3 beta to be released version.

As per the latest figure on coinmarketcap, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrency reaches 26 billion USD this morning. Dash sets all-time high against btc and takes the 3rd position on the market cap board. On the other hand, bitcoin market dominance dropped to a record low at around 77%.
Is this another classic pump and dump trick? Probably not.
ETH could have been utilized by pyramid scheme, according to the latest statement from Yunbi. They will freeze any suspicious account linked to MLM address for up to 30 days. The statement reads:
Recently, some of the platform use ETH to do pyramid schemes. In order to comply with the AML policy of PBoC, Yunbi will reinforce ETH withdrawal inspection. Yunbi has the responsibility to freeze the suspicious users account and report the materials to the regulation administration. YUNBI will strictly comply with the AML policy and work with regulation department to strike the illegal assets using the blockchain to escape oversea.
It's not the first time that ETH has been linked to pyramid schemes, but it ‘s the first time that exchanges halted ETH withdrawal using this as excuse. Some evidence could be found here, subforum of Yunbi on 8btc.
Meanwhile, the size of mempool of bitcoin is slowly dropping while a top-upvoted reddit post on Ethereum :
Coinbase will no longer pay for miner fees. People will soon find out how expensive it is to use bitcoin instead of eth!
Bitcoin is still haunted by the war between CORE and BU. All of the meetups, debates and political mediation seems to be of no effect. With the recent malleability attack launched by bitclub pool, the divergence now escalates to a new level with the latest statement from Jihan Wu, CEO of Bitmain.
As disclosed by Jihan Wu , the malleability attack launched by Bitclub was actually the work of a member of CORE devs.
“Bitclub launched malleability attack on the network. It's learned that the owner of Bitclub neither was informed nor authorized prior to the attack. Bitclub is managed by one of the core devs. The filthy attack will be a very important event in the defeat of the totalitarian group who are supportintg small blocks. “
Jihan Wu comments on bitclub malleability attack (weibo screenshot)
The next day, Jihan expressed firm support on BU and implied hardfork to implement onchain scaling.
“Antpool express support to on-chain scaling by switching to Bitcoin Unlimited but is still open to other scaling solutions. Meanwhile, even most of hashrate switches to BU, hardfork is not going to happen within a short while. The hardfork requires intensive coordination between miners and the whole ecosystem.”
The statement was reposted by Wu Gang, founder of Haobtc, with the following comment:
“Bitcoin is the blockchain with the most hashrate. The network is secured by the majority of hashrate. It doesn't matter what clients we are using.”
As some 8btc user puts , the “BU party” faces criticism from the node crash and should review the code quality. The slow progress of bitcoin scaling has pushed the transaction fee to an unprecedented 1 USD/tx on average.

Shrewsbury Town 1
Akpa Akpro 84
Bradford City 1
Proctor 71
Saturday 16 April, 2016
By Damien Wilkinson
In a match absolutely dominated by the Bantams, a fifth consecutive 1-0 victory eluded the promotion-chasers who had to settle for a point.
City's lack of a killer touch came back to haunt them today – despite 17 corners and 16 shots on goal, the Bantams simply could not finish the home side off, with the Salopians understandably looking delighted to snatch a draw from the game, the result mirroring the reverse fixture last August.
Thankfully other results at the top of the table weren't too bad from a City perspective and the draw managed to maintain the 4th place spot in advance of a busy week.
Phil Parkinson kept faith with the side that has ground out the last two of City's recent flurry of 1-0 wins, naming an unchanged starting line up and bench.
Shrewsbury, without a win since beating Coventry on the 8 March, approached the game hovering above the League 1 trap door in 20th spot, one point above Blackpool. Manager Micky Mellon faced a number of selection headaches; keeper Mark Halstead missed the match through suspension and faced the loss of defender Mickey Demetriou following a knee injury earlier this month.
The Shrews have two games in hand on their rivals albeit including trips to Walsall and Gillingham, which also may well play a part in City's play off fate, as well as their own survival.
The Bantams dominated the match right from the start and the bulk of the first half was played down the far end away from another vociferous away following.
City controlled the play and possession and it looked like they had taken the lead on nine minutes when Billy Clarke turned the ball into the net. But the assistant linesman raised his flag for offside, a decision Phil Parkinson contested after the match.
As the half progressed, it looked like a matter of time before City made the breakthrough and further chances began to emerge. Jamie Proctor was in the thick of things, heading across the box after a smart free kick from Tony McMahon, and then forcing an important deflection when through on goal.
The Shrews will have been thankful to get to half time on level terms and started the second half with a bit more purpose, exerting some pressure on the City defence. Mellon had interestingly played his cards early; after a late substitution in the first half, he made his second and third substitutions right after the break bringing on Shaun Walley and James Wallace, perhaps in recognition of how far adrift his team had been in the first half.
However, City soon got back into their stride and began to up the ante. As in the first half chances came and went, a number of crosses into the box couldn't quite draw that killer final touch, and Proctor was manhandled to the ground after a corner which the referee waved away.
Phil Parkinson made his first change of the day on 65 minutes bringing on striker Steve Davies for his now usual 30 minutes or so outing.
Just when it looked like all the pressure would be in vain up popped Jamie Procter to bullet a header into the far corner on 71 minutes after a cross from Tony McMahon. 1-0 and business as usual – or so it seemed.
Indeed at that point City looked good value for either seeing out another 1-0 victory or adding to the score to end the game comfortably.
Unfortunately neither outcome happened. Despite further pressure and chances, City couldn't make their dominance count further and were hit by a classic sucker punch on 84 minutes.
Shrewsbury had begun to create some openings and were enjoying more possession in the final third, but a fairly hopeful ball from Mat Sadler into the box managed to draw Ben Williams out of his goal, fail to reach the ball and allowed Jean-Louis Akpa-Akpro to guide the the ball into the empty net for the equaliser.
A bitter blow and a rare lapse of judgement from keeper Williams who has made some match saving stops recently as he has racked up clean sheets. It always looked like a tall order for Williams to claim the ball amongst a crowded penalty area, and it looked very much like a rush of blood for him to race out to try to claim the ball.
Despite a late onslaught and chances, and further changes with James Hanson and Filipe Morais replacing Proctor and Reid, the Bantams failed to restore their superiority in terms of the scoreline and the match finished all square.
To be honest it was probably always going to be a big ask to see out yet another 1-0 win, and showed the precarious nature of such a scoreline. There is always a risk that despite being under the cosh, the opposition always has a chance to retrieve something from the game whilst it remains finely poised. Furthermore, the magical five wins on the spin continued to elude Phil Parkinson in his time at City so far.
So what about that killer instinct? Were City guilty of not going for the jugular? Well my opinion was that we certainly didn't shut up shop and did try to get the second goal for the bulk of the game – it was one of those games when it just wouldn't arrive and City were also thwarted by keeper Jayson Leutwiler, who made some good stops. Ultimately there was a striking similarity with what we have seen all season – underlined by 48 goals in 42 games, and a tendency to struggle to finish teams off.
Whilst it was a frustrating outcome, it is worth remembering that this consistency has got us to where we currently are placed.
Jamie Procter had another great performance and, crucially, the switch of bringing on Steve Davies and later James Hanson didn't quite have the impact we have witnessed in recent games. However, Filipe Morais looked lively when introduced and carved out some good chances albeit they couldn't be converted.
Overall it probably just was one of those days; things often even themselves out and despite showing a greater superiority and performance than seen in the last few matches, there may be some arguments that it offsets some of the ‘luck' we perhaps have had over some of our previous games.
At this point, a slight return back down to earth might not necessarily be a bad thing and help reignite the focus on the remaining four games and hopefully beyond. With Wigan losing today we would have probably been talking about a late surge for the top spot had we won this!
Expect some more twists and turns, ups and downs, as we navigate our way through the next four games. How we react to them will be crucial in where we finish and perhaps more importantly how we approach the play off fixtures should we get there.
So, some disappointment but no cause to be downhearted, the point today might turn out to be useful as the season reaches an exciting climax. The attention now turns to Coventry on Tuesday night, which will hopefully set things up nicely for the mouth-watering visit of 3rd place Walsall to Valley Parade on Saturday.
City: Williams, Darby, N Clarke, Burke, Meredith, McMahon, Cullen, Evans, Reid (Morais 82), B Clarke (Davies 65), Proctor (Hanson 78)

It will be gaming season soon and Marvel won't be missing out on the chance to expand its presence in the fast-growing mobile gaming market. At the New York Comic Convention, the comics publisher announced two games that will soon be making an appearance on Android.
People will probably be more familiar with Marvel: Avengers Alliance, a turn-based social network game that has been quite popular on Facebook. The game will soon be updated to incorporate themes and characters from the upcoming “Thor: The Dark World” film. But probably of more interest is the announcement that the game will finally be heading towards Android next month. Previously, the mobile version of the game has only been available on iOS.
Marvel has also announced a relatively new title called “Marvel Run Jump Smash!” The game is basically a side-scrolling runner that should be familiar to many Android gamers. The game, which according to Marvel is quite a hit in Korea, stars popular Marvel characters such as Iron Man, Captain America, The Hulk, Black Widow, with more to come. Hit the trailer below to watch your favorite Avengers in all their running and tumbling and cutesy glory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DYRcLIeoEs
Marvel: Avengers Alliance is scheduled to hit Google Play Store on November 21 and will probably be available for free just like the iOS versions. There is, however, no set date for the launch of Marvel Run Jump Smash! but it should probably happen around the same time.

As you're browsing for something to watch on a chilly evening, do yourself a favor and choose to watch the Emmy-winning ‘Over the Garden Wall.'
If you have somehow missed the awakening cult of pumpkin spice, sweaters, scarves, and Anne of Green Gables quotes about October, fall has arrived. As the leaves turn, the air cools, and we all brace for winter, now is the perfect time to invest in a fall tradition you never realized you were missing. This season, as you're browsing through the ever-growing catalog of options on Hulu or Netflix to find something to watch on a chilly evening, do yourself a favor and choose to watch the best TV show you've never heard of: “Over the Garden Wall.”
“Over the Garden Wall” is an Emmy-winning ten-part animated miniseries that originally aired on Cartoon Network in November 2014. CN aired two episodes a night, with all ten episodes together running just under two hours. The show is the artistic brainchild of Patrick McHale, best known for his work as a creative director and writer for Cartoon Network's hit show “Adventure Time.”
The tale centers on two brothers, Wirt (Elijah Wood) and Greg (Collin Dean), who find themselves lost in autumnal woods in “The Unknown,” a mysterious, haunting land populated by talking animals, pumpkin-wearing skeletons, and musically gifted frogs. They encounter a woodsman (Christopher Lloyd) who warns them of The Beast who wanders the woods, seeking lost children to devour. The woodsman points them towards a nearby town, setting in motion a series of gloomy misadventures as the lost boys seek to find their way home.
Throughout the show, the brothers and their human-turned-bird companion Beatrice (Melanie Lynskey) learn valuable lessons about leadership, responsibility, loyalty, friendship, and hope via their meetings with a colorful cast of supporting characters, voiced by an all-star cast, including John Cleese and Tim Curry. “Over the Garden Wall” is a beautifully written story that evokes fitting comparisons to classic, dark, German fairy tales such as those found in the Grimms' fairy tales collection.
The Intertwined Lives of Two Brothers
Although each main character is complex and well developed, the evolving relationship between the two brothers throughout the danger they face is the highlight of the story. Wirt is a melodramatic teenager in a gnome costume whose poetic self-abasement and constant self-esteem issues lead him to be unnecessarily critical towards his innocent younger brother, Greg. Viewers learn in the fourth episode (“Songs of the Dark Lantern”) that Wirt's mother remarried and had Greg with Wirt's stepfather, establishing Greg as an unwanted intrusion in Wirt's life. As a young child, Greg presents a constant challenge and annoyance to Wirt, both before and during their adventures in the Unknown.
Greg is a rare, masterfully written child character whose actions and dialogue are exactly what one would expect from a fanciful, playful boy: he is easily distracted, hyperactive, sometimes random, and relentlessly pursues fun. This causes no end of consternation for Wirt, who blames Greg and his behavior for their predicament.
However, in the first episode (“The Old Grist Mill”), the woodsman cautions Wirt that as the older brother, he is responsible for his younger brother, childish flaws and all. The woodsman charges Wirt to take his responsibility as the elder child seriously as the children attempt to find their way out of the Unknown.
It is quite a while before the woodsman's advice takes, as Wirt continues to criticize and berate Greg more and more the further they travel, until impressionable Greg fully believes that their dire situation is his own fault. After Wirt gives up all hope, Greg takes responsibility in an act of loving self-sacrifice, hoping to secure a way for his brother to return home. Through Greg's example, Wirt learns to take responsibility for his actions and simultaneously grows to value his heroic sibling.
Depth and Charm for Young and Old
Despite its award-winning quality, the show resides in relative obscurity with a nonetheless dedicated fan base. Fans spend time on the show's subreddit puzzling through the many themes and references, with some suggesting that the show includes allusions to the works of Dante in the presentation of the Unknown and the characters found there. In any case, while technically a children's show, “Over the Garden Wall's” darkness and depth makes it well suited to young and old viewers alike.
The charming story is accompanied by a surprisingly excellent soundtrack, available to stream on Amazon Music and Spotify. It includes goofy, catchy tunes composed by Greg (“Potatoes and Molasses” and “Adelaide Parade” are highlights), as well as bluesy, soulful numbers such as “Old North Wind” and “Patient is the Night.” The soundtrack makes for an enjoyable listen on its own, but it serves to carry the sincere emotion of the playful story throughout all its twists and turns.
“Over the Garden Wall” is a fairytale for the modern day. It offers cautions and morals, as any good fairytale should, along with all of the adorable absurdity of contemporary animation and storytelling. It is a story with many layers, allusions, and subtleties that reward multiple viewings.

Brett Ellis, a real estate agent in Fort Myers, Fla., was thrilled when he got an offer for a property in Bell Tower Park in May 2008.
"It was a gorgeous property on the corner lot," Ellis told the Huffington Post. The owner, who had lost his job, wanted to sell the apartment for a loss rather than go into foreclosure, a strategy known as a short sale.
The offer was for $350,000, and Ellis, who is a certified distressed property expert trained in executing such sales, knew it was as good an offer as he was going to get in this market. He immediately sent the paperwork into the bank.
He waited for four months. The bank finally told him it wouldn't take anything less than $400,000 -- a price Ellis was sure he could never get. In September, the buyer's agent called to say, "You know what, we gotta move on, we gotta buy something else."
Now the property is sitting vacant as it slides into foreclosure. Its former owner's credit is destroyed, and the house is losing value every day. "God knows what the condition is today," Ellis said, adding he'd be surprised if the property is worth more than $290,000 when it resurfaces on the market. Add in the legal expenses involved in a foreclosure, and the bank cost itself a hundred thousand dollars more that it otherwise would have.
It's a scenario that plays out constantly, everywhere in the United States. In a time of collapsing real estate values, where one in five homes are now underwater, a short sale is increasingly the only option before foreclosure. It is less damaging to credit scores and spares the homeowner the shame of foreclosure.
It is also a better option for banks: According to one analysis, short sales resulted in loan losses of only 19 percent, compared with an average loss of 40 percent on homes sold after foreclosure.
So why aren't these sales more widely used?
The broad answer is that the American financial system simply can't handle a collapse of this magnitude. The fates of the banking and real estate industries are intertwined. But they don't work together -- and the result is that they end up working against each other.
The more precise answer is related to securitization, the method by which banks bundle together different mortgages and slice them up and sell the pieces to various investors. Securitization makes negotiating a real estate sale that results in a loss nearly impossible.
"The most significant aspect is that so many of the banks' mortgages have been securitized, put together and bundled, sold off to Iceland or China or some godforsaken place," said Dave Liniger, founder and chairman of global real estate company Re/Max, in an interview with the Huffington Post. "The bank has to go through all of the various people who are stakeholders and it becomes a very lengthy process, and the bank is turning off the realtors by not even getting answers back to them, sometimes for months."
Banks have little incentive to untie those bundles. Since mortgages are listed on the banks' balance sheets at the value of the original loan, if they complete a short sale they must record a loss on their balance sheets. That would explain why banks drag the process out as long as possible. In Ellis' case, the property is sitting vacant a year after the first offer, allowing the bank to list the original value on its balance sheet all along.
According to research firm Campbell Communications, only 23 percent of short sale transactions are actually completed. "Three out of four potential short sale transactions fail, principally because the mortgage servicer takes too long to respond to the offer," said Tom Popik, author of a February survey of real estate agents. "When these same properties are later sold it further depresses real estate prices."
Congress has had as much success untangling this mess as real estate agents.
"We've been trying to figure out probably for close to two years now why so few mortgages are being modified when it seems to make absolute business sense for the person holding the mortgage to modify rather than foreclose or to take a smaller loss selling it rather than a bigger loss foreclosing on it," said Rep. Brad Miller (D-N.C.).
Miller points his finger at securitization. Once the mortgages are bundled and sliced up into different pieces, known as tranches, the owners of the pieces get paid back according to a certain pecking order. Senior investors get paid back first and if there's a loss, the most junior investors won't get anything. It's those investors who are blocking short sales.
"The people with the least senior tranches have no reason to agree to the modification because they take a complete loss and the people in the most senior tranches don't lose anything. So they've managed to structure their mortgages in a way that makes it almost impossible to modify or sell short," said Miller.
Miller sponsored legislation to reform the bankruptcy code to allow judges to rewrite those contracts, taking away the ability of junior investors to sue and encouraging them to negotiate. But the House-approved measure died in the Senate, 51-45, killed last week by Republicans and 12 Democrats, leaving it 15 votes short of the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster.
Dave Liniger of Re/Max said the provision would have changed the bargaining landscape. Lenders would have had much more of an incentive to take a loss on a short sale rather than see a judge unilaterally change the terms of a mortgage.
"It was a negotiating ploy more than anything," Liniger said.
"It's disappointing," said Financial Services Committee chairman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) of the banks' tendency to foreclose rather than agree to a sale. "I've heard that and I've been trying to press the banks not to do that."
Without bankruptcy reform, the only power the government has is persuasion.
"In the absence of bankruptcy [legislation], you're talking about contracts that we cannot abrogate," he told the Huffington Post. "That's why bankruptcy was so important."
Is there any chance Congress will return to it?
"Excuse me, what planet were you on last week? The vote was 45 to 51. Why would you ask that? Do I think there's a likelihood we could overturn 45-51? No," said Frank.
"I wish it weren't the case," he added. "Maybe there's some kind of compromise."
Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) isn't confident. "The purpose of the debate last week was to try to create some impetus for the banks to start renegotiating these mortgages in a positive way and the industry fought it," Durbin, who last week concluded banks "frankly own the place," told the Huffington Post. "I think many of the banks have not operated in good faith when it comes to this mortgage foreclosure issue."
Homeowners are the big losers of the banks' battle against the bill. But real estate agents are now losing real money as commissions fall through, making them a potential lobbying counterweight to the banks.
The National Association of Realtors wants the rules changed: "We are advocating measures that would help streamline the process when using FHA, Fannie or Freddie," said NAR spokeswoman Mary Trupo in a statement to the Huffington Post. "We are hoping that new process and regulations are put in place."
Fannie Mae just wrapped up a pilot program to test a process for streamlining short sales by partnering with local listing providers in Arizona and Florida to pre-approve 400 properties for short sales. The government-backed mortgage firm is still evaluating feedback from brokers, but overall the program was a success, and a new short sale initiative is in the works for this year.
"Short sales are one of the tools to avoid foreclosure if all other workout options are exhausted. It's always in the best interest of the homeowner, the community, and the investor to avoid foreclosure," said Fannie Mae spokeswoman Amy Bonitatibus in a statement to the Huffington Post.
Liniger says Re/Max recently trained 5,000 employees in short sales.
Lita Smith-Mines, a lawyer who specializes in real estate on Long Island, told the Huffington Post she and her colleagues often see short sales turn into foreclosures because the bank won't play along--even when losses are as small as $25,000 and the offer is as high as it will get. And much higher, in this market, than the bank will get from a foreclosure auction. The legal costs of foreclosure alone typically run to $50,000.
"There's no common sense when it comes to lenders. They have their paperwork and if you don't slot perfectly in, they just say no," she said.
"A lot was taken on the front end [during the housing boom], but they're not giving anything back on the back end," she said. Smith-Mines, though, said she isn't surprised. "If they actually cared about borrowers, we wouldn't be in this mess in the first place."

UFC Fight Night 87 is scheduled to be the promotions inaugural show in the Netherlands. Zuffa's debut goes down this Sunday, May 8, 2016 at the Ahoy Rotterdam and features two of the heavyweight divisions' most storied veterans. Those fighters, whose careers have spanned over a decade, are decorated competitors in various MMA organizations.
Keys to Victory: Alistair Overeem vs Andrei Arlovski
Arlovski, a former UFC champion, has fought in virtually every major organization before returning to the UFC in one of the sport's most compelling comeback narratives. Once considered gatekeeper who was well past his prime, Arlovski danced with title contention after a four-fight win streak that was snapped by none other than upcoming title challenger Stipe Miocic. Now, his career hangs in the balance as he faces one of the most feared strikers to ever compete in combat sports.
Alistair Overeem has fought the who's who in MMA and in kickboxing. Arguably amongst the heavyweight division's most accomplished strikers, Overeem is a veteran of over 70 professional fights and has won titles in Strikeforce and DREAM, and is one of two fighters to hold a K-1 Grand Prix title and an MMA world title concurrently. Like Arlovski, Overeem has experienced the extreme highs and lows of a long career in fighting, from the glory of knocking out Brock Lesnar in his UFC debut at UFC 141 to suffering consecutive knockout victories to Antonio Silva and Travis Browne.
Both Overeem and Arlovski technically train at the same gym, Jackson-Wink MMA Academy in Albuquerque, NM, but will not present a conflict of interest for head trainer Greg Jackson. In an interview with MMA Mania, Greg Jackson explains why this situation will not precipitate internal conflict. Jackson indicates that he has learned from his mistake when Jon Jones fought Rashad Evans at UFC 145 back in 2012.
Jackson has stated that he will corner Arlovski, and that they have a very large gym, with each fighter training at different times.
Both fighters have flirted with a title shot in the heavyweight division, with the winner likely facing the victor of the upcoming title bout between Stipe Miocic and Fabricio Werdum. However, despite the fact that heavyweights tend to reach the zenith of their careers later than other divisions, there is little doubt that time is of the essence.
Overeem, who fights just nine days before his 36th birthday, looked excellent in his last performance, knocking out Junior dos Santos with a leaping left hook before finishing him with hammer fists. Notwithstanding that performance, he needs to capitalize on this opportunity and prove to the UFC and to the fans that he is still in his prime and poses a legitimate threat to the title.
Arlovski finds himself in an oddly similar position. At 37-years-old and coming off a knockout loss to Miocic, he needs a strong performance to establish himself as the next title challenger. A loss for either fighter could spell doom, especially considering the consequences of staying in the sport too long. Both fighters are fearsome strikers with devastating knock out power in both hands, and both will likely try to keep this fight on the feet.
The keys to victory for Andrei Arlovski are simple: he needs to be the quicker fighter, use good head movement and establish a strong jab early in the fight. Because he tends to get over-aggressive, he must exercise discipline and not just headhunt. Assuming he shows up in good shape, he needs to utilize proper footwork to keep himself just out of the striking range of Overeem. Footwork is key, since standing and lingering in the pocket is likely to leave openings for Overeem's patented knees of destruction, which he throws to the head and body with reckless abandon.
Arlovski can avoid those knees if he keeps moving his head and immediately throws uppercuts whenever Overeem looks to clinch or close the distance. Overeem has the tendency to wade in, hoping his opponent will lean into the clinch where he can throw those knees and send his opponent crashing into the canvas.
Arlovski has a good chance to win this fight by knockout, especially if he maintains forward pressure and emphasizes speed over power. Overeem has demonstrated a vulnerable chin, and Arlovski doesn't need to land with 100% to put the towering Dutchman down.
Likewise, Arlovski himself has demonstrated a questionable chin, and Overeem only needs one opening to shut the lights off with a pinpoint strike. Typically a slow starter, Overeem has the propensity to plod forward, relying on his ability to counter rather than evade entirely. Therefore, Overeem needs to be vigilant to utilize lateral movement, mixing up his footwork with shuffles, slides, and skips rather than his simply raising his lead leg as a knee shield and inching forward with his back foot. Overeem has some holes in his defense, which Ben Rothwell exploited perfectly in Overeem's last defeat inside the octagon. He can learn from this mistake, however, and shore up his defensive striking to frustrate the Belarusian warrior and bait him into over-extending himself.
Overeem has superb kickboxing and a vastly underrated ground game, so it would be wise to mix up his striking with the occasional takedown attempt. He has excellent foot sweeps and solid top control, as he thoroughly demonstrated in the one-sided drubbing of Frank Mir (a common opponent) at UFC 169. One interesting point is that Overeem controlled Mir on the ground, dishing out vicious ground-and-pound and dominating the fight, while the most Arlovski could do was stifle Frank Mir's venerated ground game.
If the fight does hit the floor, expect Overeem to have the advantage, possibly opening up some cuts on Arlovski with his elbows and ground-and-pound. Arlovski isn't known for his offensive jiu jitsu, and will most likely try to hold on and stall to prompt a referee stand-up rather than work escapes and submissions. Overeem has an excellent base and is very difficult to sweep, so don't expect Arlovski to throw up any scissor sweeps or triangles from his back.
By most accounts, Overeem stands at a healthy -220 favorite, which is entirely justifiable if you look at each fighter's last performance. The main event bout is nonetheless difficult to call, given the unpredictability of the sport, let alone the heavyweight division, where one shot can dramatically alter the course of the fight.
Taking all of these factors into account, don't be surprised to see Overeem play it safe as he did in the Mir fight at UFC 169 in order to secure a victory and perhaps the next shot at the heavyweight title.

Cord cutting is a real trend and it's only accelerating. If you still need more evidence for this, look at a new Strategy Analytics study showing that in the most recent quarter “total subscribers among the tracked [pay TV] operators declined at the highest rate we have seen so far.” Samuel W. Bennett has posted a chart that nicely shows how cable TV subscriptions have been steadily declining as Netflix subscriptions have been rising at a significantly faster rate.
MUST READ: Credit cards change forever starting today – here's what you need to know
So that settles it: Netflix is the future and companies like Comcast are relics, right? Not at all.
While the future of TV is online on-demand streaming over the web, you need to have high-speed, high-capacity networks capable of handling all that video traffic. And an FCC report from earlier this year found Comcast and Time Warner Cable combined account for 57% of all Internet connections with speeds of 25Mbps or greater in the United States.
So if cable companies are losing revenue from their pay TV services, they have a simple solution to make up for that lost money: Jack up prices. This is particularly easy to do in markets where cable companies face no competition for broadband customers, which is a tragically common reality in much of the United States.
And make no mistake: This is an industry that has no qualms about raising prices. From Strategy Analytics' report, look at how the average revenue per video subscriber has continued to climb even as the number of total subscribers has gone down:
So while online streaming has freed us from having to subscribe to pricey cable bundles, it hasn't yet freed us from the cable companies. And there's no way it will do so until there's more competition for broadband services in the U.S.
2016 Team of the Year Winners – SK Gaming
With their incredible 2016 in the books, let's take a look at exactly why this Brazilian squad has awed us and been awarded our 2016 Team of the Year award.
Current Roster:
Ricardo ‘fox' Pacheco
Gabriel ‘FalleN' Toledo
Fernando ‘fer' Alvarenga
Marcelo ‘coldzera' David
Epitacio ‘TACO' de Melo
Premier Tournament level placings:
1st (3x)
2nd (5x)
3rd – 4th (5x)
9th – 12th (1x)
It's been an up and down year in 2016. We have seen a lot of teams rise to the occasion late in the year, but none have been as consistent as SK Gaming. With two Major wins under their belts and numerous Top 4 placings, the boys from Brazil have been in top form throughout the year. Let us take a look at their various performances throughout the year.
Starting the Year off Right
While under the Luminosity Gaming banner, the Brazilian team started 2016 strong with a 3rd – 4th finish at Starladder and a 2nd place at DreamHack Leipzig to Natus Vincere. At this point in time Luminosity was really rolling especially as a new organization on the scene.
The fact that they were a newish team and org really impresses me as to how they stuck together to go from constantly taking second or third, to winning the best event of 2016 MLG Columbus.
Major Success
MLG Columbus was the first Counter-Strike event hosted by the longtime North American Tournament Organizer Major League Gaming (MLG), and by all measures it was a huge success. The first Major in CS:GO history to feature a million dollar prize pool, MLG Columbus recorded 37 million hours watched on Twitch and two million on MLG.tv.
In front of so many eyeballs, SK Gaming (then Luminosity Gaming) put on a show going perfect in the group stage and only dropping one map the entire tournament. With such a dominant performance it looked like the Brazilian roster would be unstoppable for at least another few months.
Unfortunately for coldzera and co. their worst performance would follow up their best. Somehow, they would be upset by mouz and TyLoo of all teams to settle for not making it out of groups at DreamHack Masters Malmo.
Of course people interpreted the results differently. Some (rightly) considered the event a fluke, but others felt the Major was a fluke. The chatter proved to be nothing but noise as the roster would silence all the haters by winning DreamHack Austin less than a month later. Riding the momentum, the team would also win ESL Pro League Season 3 Finals and place second at the ECS season finals, but with a Major looming a changing of the guard occurred.
The Switch
After playing with Luminosity in all of 2016, the players decided to change orgs and sign with SK Gaming before ESL One Cologne. There was a bit of controversy with the move that led to SK Gaming not being able to attend ELEAGUE Season 1, but that did not change their dominant performance at ESL One Cologne where they dropped one map in the playoffs.
After Cologne, the two time champs looked to be unstoppable once again in future tournaments but unfortunately for Brazil that was not necessarily the case. They were in good form at ESL One NYC, but lost a thriller to Virtus.Pro in the semifinals.
Another disappointment would come in Moscow where again SK would lose to Virtus.Pro in the semifinals, but SK Gaming looked to be sharp. The surprise for SK would come at home in Brazil to the unlikeliest of opponents.
Brawl in Brazil
ESL Pro League Finals was a familiar stage for the Brazilian roster. Winning the previous season and playing on home soil made SK Gaming a logical choice to take the tournament. Unfortunately for the thousands of cheering fans in São Paulo, Brazil, Cloud9 cleaned the floor with SK Gaming on Mirage and Dust2.
For Cloud9 this was their signature win of the year and a milestone for North American competition. For SK Gaming this was an embarrassment.
Team of the Year
While some say that, “no one remembers who comes in second,” SK Gaming made a lot of money doing it. The original roster would finish their time together with a second place finish at IEM Oakland to Ninjas in Pyjamas and a 3rd-4th at ELeague Season 2 after losing 2-0 to Astralis when something caused the team to drop Lincoln ‘fnx' Lau and have Ricardo ‘fox' Pacheco stand in.
Despite their recent shortcomings, SK Gaming still deserve the throne for 2016 after: winning all of the year's majors, consistent top placings at increasingly difficult tournaments, and changing orgs midway through the year. Two players (coldzera and FalleN) for SK Gaming were formally recognized at the Esports Industry Awards and coldzera again was recognized at The Game Awards as the “Esport Player of the Year” by Olympian legend Michael Phelps.
With their spot at the upcoming ELeague Major secure, SK Gaming has a bright future for themselves in 2017. Even if they do not reach the lofty heights they made for themselves in 2016, they always have the past to look back on.
Do you think SK Gaming is the CS:GO 2016 Team of the Year? Let us know why or why not in the comments!

Six Midwestern cities are among 22 communities nationwide that were commended on Monday for taking innovative approaches to streamlining solar development.
Their actions were aimed at reducing the “soft costs” of solar installation – the costs outside the actual hardware – and are estimated by the federal Department of Energy to comprise about two-thirds of the price of a solar installation.
Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and St. Paul; as well as Kansas City, Columbia and Gladstone in Missouri, are among the cities that were recognized at a meeting in Kansas City of the International City/County Management Association.
Although federal and state governments generally take the spotlight for offering tax breaks and other incentives aimed at fostering solar, “cities can do a lot about soft costs,” said Gayle Prest, Minneapolis' sustainability director. “How easy is it to get a permit? How fast can you get it? What is the city doing to help finance, or to market, solar?”
Five years ago, the federal Department of Energy launched its SunShot initiative, aimed at making solar energy cost competitive with other forms of energy by the end of the decade. Reducing soft costs is one aspect of the program.
The management association, together with the Solar Foundation, identified cities they believe have effectively streamlined the city building and zoning bureaucracy, or otherwise eased the process for installing solar panels.
In Columbia, for example, the city council recently passed a revision of the building code that will require all new residences to be solar-ready. As of Oct. 1, they will be mandated to have adequate south-facing exposure, sufficient structural support to hold up solar panels, and a roof pitch that will optimize solar production, said Connie Kaprowicz, a spokeswoman for the city-owned utility.
About a year ago, the city began offering low-interest loans to electricity customers wanting to install solar panels. With interest rates ranging from 1 percent for a three-year loan to 5 percent for a six-to-10 year loan, the revolving loan fund is financed through the electric department's general revenues.
“It makes it very favorable for people who don't have the money upfront,” Kaprowicz said.
And in 2009, the city utility began to pay a rebate of $500 per kilowatt for up to 10 kilowatts of capacity. It also pays retail rate for any excess solar energy produced by its customers.
“We feel that solar is an important resource during the summer peak,” Kaprowicz said.
In Kansas City, the process began with a close look at the zoning code, said Dennis Murphey, the city's chief environmental officer.
“While the code had never prohibited solar installations, we found it didn't speak to them, which left a lot of uncertainty about whether you needed any permit to do solar,” he said. “We revised the zoning ordinance to clearly indicate that solar installations are allowed on structures or on ground mounts in the back or side yard of a house. Anywhere in the city. There are no limitations in terms of zoning districts.”
The city has aimed to facilitate solar installations by creating a “one-stop shop” where, according to Murphey, a permit for a residential solar array generally can be had in little more than one hour.
“In many communities,” he said, “apparently the process for getting a building permit can be a significant obstacle.” In Kansas City, by “cross-training” codes reviewers and building inspectors, he said, “one single reviewer will be fully capable of discussing electrical, structural and zoning requirements. That saves the homeowner and installer time and money. If it's a straightforward residential install – which most are – the permit can be granted within an hour of the application.”
Commercial projects are a bit more idiosyncratic, and so take longer, he pointed out.
The City of Minneapolis created a very detailed and specific solar checklist “making it very clear what the process is,” said Gayle Prest, the city's sustainability director. “You can come in to the permit desk and get a permit the same day, which is amazing compared to some other cities. Once you get your permit, we do an inspection within days. It's about moving this along as quickly as we can.”
Although the Solar Foundation and city-management association identified a couple dozen cities with exemplary solar policies and practices, they remain a small minority, according to Brian Ross, a senior program director with the Great Plains Institute in Minneapolis.
In a blog post one year ago, he wrote that although most U.S. cities and towns have taken “deliberate steps to enable development of their local resources, to become ‘shovel-ready' for development that brings jobs…..most communities have not made themselves ‘shovel-ready' for solar development. Local policy, regulation, public investment and programmatic initiatives frequently end up creating barriers, rather than opportunities, for solar development.”

Barcelona's former sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta says the club wanted to sign Sergio Aguero originally, but ended up going for Liverpool's Luis Suarez.
Sport EN
Zubizarreta, who was sacked by the club last January, revealed in an interview with Marca that the original plan was to make a move for the Manchester City striker.
Augero is a long-time friend of Lionel Messi and it was thought that he would fit straight into the team, although Suarez himself has since built up an excellent relationship with Messi and has helped forge one of the most formidable front threes in football history - Neymar being the third member.
“We had several options, but Luis Suarez was not the first option - he knows that,” Zubizarreta admitted.
“We were planning to sign Aguero, but that didn't come off.
“After that, though, there were no doubts: Luis Suarez was our only objective.”
The ex-Spain goalkeeper also explained that Suarez's bite on Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup in Brazil helped Barça's move for the Uruguayan as it left some of their competitors reluctant to push through a deal.
“While we were negotiating for him the [biting] incident happened with Chiellini,” he added.
“That meant a lot of the clubs hoping to sign him had doubts [about committing to a deal].
“They were questioning his character and they didn't know how serious the ban was going to be.
“I thought it was the moment to accelerate our bid to sign him.”
Former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) welterweight kingpin Georges St. Pierre has given his first interview since walking away from the sport of mixed martial arts (MMA) back in December.
And I've got bad news for fans who are still hoping for a quick return.
St. Pierre is "very happy" after spending the holidays with his family, something that was impossible as champion of the 170-pound division. In addition, he does not regret his decision to jump ship following his controversial win at UFC 167 and looks forward to future projects -- with details that are too secret to divulge.
"Rush" talks to Edmonton Sun:
"I spent Christmas time and New Years, with my family. That's something I haven't done for a long time. This is the first time I've really had nothing on my schedule. It was perfect. It was fun. It's the first time it felt so good. I'm 32 years old and this is the first time I have my Christmas with my family. I spent some time but I never really had free time, total free time like I did. It was time for me to do it. I'm very happy I did it and I don't regret any of it. So Christmas was incredible and now for 2014 we'll see what's going to happen. I have some projects in mind. I can't talk about it, unfortunately. I needed to take a step out of it and now let's see what's going to happen."
This isn't the first time the French-Canadian has threatened to blow up the Internet.
In his absence, Johny Hendricks and Robbie Lawler will bang it out for the welterweight title as the headlining act at UFC 171, which takes place inside the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas, on March 15, 2014 (details). That will give St. Pierre plenty of time to fix these problems before he returns to the cage.
Or perhaps I should say, if he returns to the cage.
Personally I have supported Donald Trump since November 9th 2013, I just didn't know who he was. After the Kentucky electorate reelected Mitch McConnell,…. well, mentally I threw in the political towel and resigned myself to watching another ridiculous Romney '12 redos with a Jeb '16 logo change.
Later, in July 2015, after the glorious bastard identified himself, and knowing what was on the horizon if we tried to explain the rather bold and disconcerting GOPe Road Map and Splitter Strategy, we began to share what we researched for the previous 2+ years.
…..The only thing more dangerous than facing down a corrupt political system with unlimited resources – is the corrupt political system facing an awakened electorate who realize they have nothing to lose….
Specifically “why I support Donald Trump” – Part One – Part Two – Part Three
We have received a number of inquires for “Tripwire Updates“, or various questions on the same overall theme “what's next“? However, before going any further down the path of prediction, perhaps you would share:

Senior politicians vow to review ties to America after discord over drone attacks and assassination of al-Qaida leader
The security of Nato's main supply line into Afghanistan came under threat on Saturday as Pakistani parliamentarians voted to review all aspects of their relationship with the US amid worsening political fallout from the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.
The unanimous motion was passed in the early hours of Saturday morning at the conclusion of an extraordinary 10-hour parliamentary session when the military's top brass offered apologies and admissions of failure, and the country's spy chief offered to resign.
Condemning the 2 May raid on bin Laden's house in Abbottabad, 35 miles northeast of Islamabad, as a "violation of Pakistan's sovereignty", parliament voted unanimously to review the country's terms of engagement with Washington.
In feisty speeches lawmakers warned against further "unilateral action", including CIA drone strikes, and urged the government to consider cutting the Nato supply line that runs from Karachi to Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass and Balochistan.
Suspicious of Pakistan's failure to capture bin Laden but recognising the importance of the supply line and pursuing other al-Qaida fugitives, the Obama administration is dispatching Senator John Kerry – the "good cop" of US diplomacy with Pakistan – to Islamabad on Sunday.
"We're not trying to find a way to break the relationship apart, we're trying to find a way to build it," he told reporters in Kabul on Saturday.
Kerry arrives in Pakistan at a time of unprecedented criticism of the powerful military. On Friday night top generals were submitted to harsh questioning from parliamentarians during a marathon session that stretched late into the night.
The inter-services intelligence (ISI) chief General Shuja Pasha, one of the most powerful figures in the country, admitted to an "intelligence failure" on Bin Laden, insisting that the ISI had been kept in the "complete dark" by the US over the raid, and tendered his resignation to prime minister Yousaf Raza Gilani. It was not accepted – a sign that the government, led by Asif Ali Zardari, has decided to support the weakened military.
The fragile civilian government is gambling that its pro-army stance will guarantee it a full term in office. "It was politically a very astute move," said Talat Masood, a retired general and political analyst.
Another striking revelation came from the deputy air force chief, who admitted that CIA drones take off from Shamsi airbase in Balochistan province. But he insisted that the drones were unarmed – those carrying missiles came from Afghanistan, he said – and that Shamsi was actually under the authority of the United Arab Emirates, which built the remote airstrip in the 1990s for rich sheikhs on bird-hunting expeditions.
Despite having been technically held in camera, details of the parliamentary session leaked out to the media. One MP told the news website Dawn that the air force chief claimed to have ordered his jet fighters to shoot down US helicopters with Bin Laden's body on board when they were leaving Pakistan, but they were too slow.
Although generally apologetic, in some instances the generals struck back at their critics. When an MP from a religious party attacked Pasha, the spy chief told the mullah that was in no position to talk because he had received funds from Libya and Saudi Arabia.
The parliamentary motion appeared intended to deflect attention from uncomfortable questions about Bin Laden's Pakistan sanctuary onto complaints about US breaches of sovereignty. But the opposition leader, Nawaz Sharif, who was ousted from power in a 1999 military coup, said he was determined to seek greater accountability of army power. "The elected government should formulate foreign policy. A parallel policy or parallel government should not be allowed to work," he told a news conference yesterday.
Deteriorating relations with the US are further complicated by a bitter row between spies on both sides. The fact that the CIA could run such a massive operation to capture Bin Laden had deeply embarrassed the ISI, said Vali Nasr, a former Obama administration advisor. "It's not just a diplomatic embarrassment, it's a counter-espionage failure," he said. "Suddenly the ISI is scared of what the CIA is capable of doing."
In a further sign of cooling relations General Khalid Wynne, chairman of Pakistan's joint chiefs of staff committee, has cancelled a five-day visit to the United States due to start on 22 May.
The US has begun to look to central Asian countries to reduce its reliance on Pakistan for military supplies to Afghanistan. The cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan has already threatened to have his supporters block military trucks passing through Peshawar.
But outside parliament, the gap between political rhetoric and ground realities is as stark as ever in Pakistan. On Friday a CIA drone fired missiles that killed five people in the tribal belt, the fourth such attack since 2 May.
Yesterday the death toll from Friday's Taliban suicide attack on a paramilitary training centre climbed to 89; a Taliban spokesman said the vicious bombing was to avenge the al-Qaida leader's death and warned of more to come.
It looks like James Neal will be back sooner rather than later.
After it was announced on March 13 that the Penguins winger would be out indefinitely with a concussion, Neal is symptom-free and was cleared to return to full practice Monday at CONSOL Energy Center.
Neal, who also skated on his own before Sunday's game vs. Philadelphia, said after practice that he was “feeling pretty good” and “had no issues.” And if he continues to remain symptom-free, Neal said there is a chance he can return Tuesday when the Penguins host his former team, the Dallas Stars.
“As long as I'm good all day today, (we'll) see what goes on (Tuesday),” said Neal, who was sidelined for Pittsburgh's home-and-home series with the Flyers this past weekend. “If I feel good in the morning, there's no reason why I can't keep going (and play vs. Dallas).”
However, head coach Dan Bylsma wasn't ready to signal Neal's return.
“Don't know at this point in time (if he can play Tuesday vs. Dallas or Thursday in Detroit),” Bylsma said. “Obviously he was symptom-free and went out for a full practice, so hopefully he remains symptom-free and can progress from there.”
Neal said his concussion was from a hit he received in a previous game, but the 26-year-old declined to give specifics on when exactly it occurred.
“Just wasn't feeling right from a hit,” he said. “Sometimes it's tough to tell. Sometimes it doesn't hit you right away. Felt a little weird, got checked out and needed a couple days and feeling better now.”
Neal said the symptoms have gone away over the last couple of days, so after skating on Sunday, he met with the doctor Monday morning – who cleared him to return to practice that day.
“Today was a good day and I felt good out there in practice,” he said. “Keep getting better from here.”
The Pens also saw another top-six winger return to full practice in Chris Kunitz.
While on a semi-breakaway early in the third period of Pittsburgh's 2-0 win over Washington on March 11, Kunitz was knocked over by Caps defenseman Mike Green on his way to the net and slammed his legs off the goalpost. Despite being in obvious pain, Kunitz was eventually able to skate the bench. He missed just one shift while talking to head athletic trainer Chris Stewart and returned to play the rest of the period.
However, while Kunitz took warmups before Pittsburgh's next game Saturday in Philadelphia, he wasn't able to play. Kunitz sat out both that game and Sunday's with a lower-body injury that had him listed as day-to-day.
Like Neal, Bylsma said Kunitz is also a possibility for Tuesday vs. Dallas.
“Chris Kunitz was on the ice skating again today, a full practice,” Bylsma said. “He went out before practice and a full practice. We'll see where he goes (for) tomorrow's game.”
Finally, Beau Bennett was also cleared to return to full practice on Monday. He engaged in high-tempo battle drills with Neal and Kris Letang at the end of the skate, and said it was a “good test for my wrist” and he “felt pretty good out there.”
Bennett originally suffered the injury Nov. 22 in a 4-3 win against the New York Islanders and underwent surgery three days later. Unfortunately, on Feb. 25 the Pens announced that Bennett suffered a “setback” and the team put him on a 3-4 week timeframe for return.
“(The doctors told me to) just keep trucking on the same path that I've been on as far as conditioning and strengthening and whatnot,” Bennett said. “So they're happy with the progress I've made over the last couple weeks and we're just going to go from here and take it day-by-day.”
Bennett admitted his frustration level with his slow recovery is high.
“But you've just got to keep everything in perspective,” he said. “It's an injury I have to deal with, but a lot of people go through a lot worse stuff and I just got to keep it all in perspective and work towards getting back and playing.”
Bylsma said that Bennett is probably going to need to see a couple more days of full practice with full contact before he can think about returning to game action. But no matter when his actual return is, Bennett knows he's close – and he's excited.
“It's been tough watching all these games,” he said. “You want to be around the team, but the fact of the matter is when you're injured you skate before the team, you're here before the team and you barely see any of the guys, so it's good to get back and get into your routine.”
NOTE: The Pens' Olympians minus Kunitz and the injured Paul Martin – Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, Brooks Orpik, Jussi Jokinen, and Olli Maatta – were given maintenance days on Monday and did not practice, per Bylsma.
HONOLULU -- The Pro Bowl will be played before the Super Bowl when it returns to Honolulu next year.
The Hawaii Tourism Authority and the NFL announced Tuesday that the game will be at Aloha Stadium on Jan. 30, the Sunday before the Super Bowl in Arlington, Texas.
The Pro Bowl had historically been played in Honolulu the week after the Super Bowl, but was changed when the all-star game moved to Miami this year.
Frank Supovitz, the NFL's senior vice president of events, said playing the Pro Bowl before the big game generated more excitement and interest and was a good kick off to Super Bowl week.
Ratings were up for the AFC-NFC matchup that was televised on ESPN. It was watched by an average of 12.3 million viewers, the most since 2000. That's up 40 percent from the 2009 Pro Bowl on NBC, which drew 8.8 million viewers when the event was held after the Super Bowl.
This year's game was in a later time slot, when more people watch TV, and competed against the Grammys on CBS, which attracted 25.8 million viewers, the most since 2004.
However, one drawback of playing the Pro Bowl first is not having any Super Bowl players.
About 40 percent of those originally selected didn't play in Miami. That included seven Indianapolis Colts and seven New Orleans Saints because they were preparing for the title game.
Besides ratings, the Miami experiment also produced more ticket sales because of the larger venue and media coverage. But several players have said they preferred playing in the islands.
And cash-strapped Hawaii, which heavily depends on tourism as its economic engine, is eager to say "aloha" again.
Mike McCartney, president and CEO of the Hawaii Tourism Authority, said the Pro Bowl has been a part of Hawaii for more than 30 years and the state welcomes the game back.
"We know how much the Pro Bowl means to our residents, the players and to the thousands of fans from the mainland who enjoy visiting our state for the game," he said in a statement. "The Pro Bowl is a great investment for our state with both economic and community benefits."
Hawaii is paying $4 million per game to host the Pro Bowl in 2011 and '12. The site for 2013 and beyond hasn't been determined.
The tourism agency estimated the 2009 game at Aloha Stadium accounted for $28.6 million in visitor spending, generated $2.9 million in state taxes and attracted 18,000 visitors.
Sending an encrypted email, for most people, is hard. Although a wave of secure messaging tools have flooded app stores since Edward Snowden's NSA revelations, and clear tutorials on how to set up encrypted email have since been penned, it can still be a daunting task for somebody who doesn't have the time or technical know-how.
But people may still want to grab their privacy back, even if they're pretty clueless on where to start. Lavaboom is a newly rebooted email provider that encrypts the metadata and content of messages between users and claims to be easy to use. What's particularly interesting is the service also obfuscates the metadata for users emailing from Lavaboom to someone else who is not using the service.
"We strip all the metadata that would be normally sent to the receiver's address, and the 'from' address and the originating IP will be right from the heart of Cologne," the company's CEO Felix Müller­-Irion told me in an email (Lavaboom is based in Cologne). This matters, because then anybody monitoring the communication should not be able to tell who sent the email from their metadata.
To put Lavaboom to the test, I decided to enlist someone with the absolute minimum of technological experience: my mum.
This is the second version of the service; the first launched in April 2014. On Friday, Lavaboom is rolling out its new service to the 25,000 people that signed up in advance.
To put Lavaboom to the test, I decided to enlist someone with the absolute minimum of technological experience: my mum.
"Go on your internet browser," I asked her over the phone.
"Err, so I go to Google, yeah?" she replied.
"Just go to where you type an address in."
"What, you mean on the email?"
"No, where you want to access a website."
We weren't off to a good start. Once she had signed up with the invite code I provided, her encryption keys were then generated in her browser.
These work in the same fashion as traditional PGP (Pretty Good Privacy, commonly used to sign and encrypt emails): there is one key for decrypting messages, and a second one that others use to encrypt messages to you. This is all done automatically via a JavaScript implementation of PGP, and the keys can also be backed up locally on the user's machine.
Screenshot of my mum's first encrypted email. Her name is redacted
After the creation of a strong password, my mum was in. She wrote a quick note to my Lavaboom email address, hit send, and that was it. In all, it took 10 minutes (I timed it).
"Oh, very easy, yes," my mum said when I asked how difficult the process was.
To check Lavaboom was sending encrypted emails, I sent a few to myself. Indeed, the text of the email was definitely encrypted, rendering it total gibberish to anyone intercepting it. Müller­-Irion said this included Lavaboom itself.
Of course, this isn't necessarily the best encryption service for highly sensitive work: Those who are particularly concerned might prefer to keep their secret key on a separate air-gapped computer, for example.
Skrillex can fly, too! At Coachella last year. Photo: Michael Tullberg/2011 Getty Images
In 2004, a 16-year-old named Sonny Moore left Los Angeles to play guitar for a band called From First to Last. Somehow he wound up becoming its lead singer instead. The group recorded for Epitaph Records, played the Warped Tour, opened for Fall Out Boy. They were a “scene” band, part of that realm of black-and-pink, mess-headed emo and hardcore acts—a world that's never entirely been embraced by the mainstream rock press. Magazines might put a big name like My Chemical Romance on the cover, for the copies it would sell; then they'd slink back to arm's-length joking about studded belts, Hot Topics, bad haircuts, kid stuff, malls, commercial rock.
These days, Moore is a black-clad producer called Skrillex; vocal-cord problems helped steer him out of the singing game. He records electronic dance music, and is lately experiencing a pretty massive flush of notoriety—a storm of interest in his new EP, Bangarang, will surely extend. A month ago, he was nominated for five Grammys, including the one for Best New Artist. When Facebook counted the most-played pieces of music on the site in 2011, two of the top 10 were by Skrillex. Kanye West spent New Year's Eve tweeting about him, including the allegation that his remix of Benny Benassi's “Cinema” is “one of the greatest works of art ever made.” He draws massive crowds at festivals like the Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas, where the Lollapalooza-sized attendance numbers positively dwarf those of rock fests you read about more often. His asymmetrical side-cut hair inspires blogs and novelty songs. The guy is rapidly becoming the face of something: a big American groundswell of love for buzzy, populist dance music.
You only have to look at the Billboard charts to notice that Americans as a whole have taken to club sounds lately. As I type this, our number-two song, “We Found Love,” has Rihanna singing over a straight-up ecstatic house production by Calvin Harris. But there's also a deeper boom going on, one you can trace down from hit producers like David Guetta and Swedish House Mafia to the huge rave-style events they play in this country; and from there to big-tent, pop-minded acts like Deadmau5, Aviici, and Kaskade; and from there to the way Skrillex can pack tour dates in places like Montana; and from there to peers like Bassnectar and 12th Planet. If these aren't names that mean much to you, well, it's a bit like that rock scene again. Those who are in the business of noticing what makes money move around the industry seem to have plenty of eyes on this stuff; notice the Grammy nods for Skrillex. Those who act as gatekeepers for musical artistry have been slightly more standoffish about it.
One reason for this is that the acts we're talking about are not, generally speaking, interested in offering some refined or studious advancement on the long, rich, soulful history of electronic dance music. Skrillex's work, in particular, is a lot more of a pile-up, as if someone's picked all the most obviously, superficially cool and high-impact parts of a dozen different genres, dredged them in stimulants, and started mashing them against one another—the same way Quentin Tarantino can rifle through a dozen film genres and borrow all the best fight scenes. There's Daft Punk's insistent pop-dance; the blocky neon blips of electro; the melodic buzz of old video games; the gushy, sentimental melodies of trance; the high-speed skip and glitch of Aphex Twin; the glammy pop feel of L.A. party music—all things that are easy to like. And when you mush them all together into one clanging, high-octane stew, they become extremely easy to like, whether or not the listener has ever known or cared about electronic music before. Not elegant, deep, or moving, but very easy to get a thrill out of.
But the genre Skrillex milks the most is dubstep. If you wanted to pick any one trick from this London genre that is super-obviously cool, fresh, and head-turning, it would be the massive, grainy bass blurts that have spun out of it, revved up by English producers like Rusko—giant, wobbling shudders that go wubwubwub and activate the same part of the brain that makes 10-year-old get excited about explosions. You hear them everywhere now: in commercials for Transformers DVDs, behind TV footage of extreme sports, folded into the bridges of pop songs. The way Americans have made these basslines lately, they're aggressive, vertiginous, and adrenaline-heavy, and they conjure up obviously cool images like being inside the gleaming metal torso of a planet-sized robot while it punches an even bigger robot, or Cookie Monster barfing up that liquid-metal Terminator from the sequel. They're littered throughout a lot of the tracks masses of Americans are suddenly raving to. The cut that got Skrillex a Grammy nod for Best Dance Recording is called “Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites”; it crashes casually back and forth between glowy video-game melodies and that big slobbery scenery-chewing dubstep grind. His remixes chew up original songs in the same way, making the source material glitch and wubwub around itself. If those big bass drops are the car-chase scene, you typically do not have to wait long for him to cut to it.
Keep in mind that Americans, and especially American males, have traditionally had some weird reservations about electronic dance music—at our worst, we've written the whole thing off as silly, trashy, soulless, effeminate, or “gay.” And there is clearly something about that gut-punch dubstep trick that can help certain Americans overcome those reservations. For one thing, it sounds essentially like hard rock or metal—a gnarly, monumental, distorted sound that tears through the middle of the frequency spectrum. (If you'd like to hear evidence of this, consult the nu-metal band Korn, who just released a “dubstep” album, complete with contributions from Skrillex himself; This blurts of bass slot easily into the space where the band would once have deployed guitars.) In Skrillex's hands, you can hear an odd, clear continuity between the world of young hair-rock and emo acts and hyperactive dance music. One of his remixes, for the Scottish band Twin Atlantic, manages to swap out their instruments for a light-speed recreation of old rave music, complete with vacuum-cleaner whooshes, sound-the-alarm noises, and chewy wubwub. (There's a slight kinship with hip-hop, too—the Bangarang EP features an L.A. party rapper called Sirah, and people dancing to Skrillex have a habit of moving their arms like they're rapping to Linkin Park songs.) It's another species of that rare and lucrative beast: A form of electronic dance music that does not threaten anyone's masculinity. Sort of like the last time electronic music threatened a sales boom in the U.S., when one of the top successes was the Prodigy, whose 1997 single “Firestarter” felt as aggro as anything else on offer.
Hence the new insult pointed at some of this American music: “brostep.” The epithet comes complete with scary visions of amped-up meatheads stomping around to the stuff—even if the actual audience is as mixed-genre as any. You can probably guess how dubstep's old English guard has reacted to the stuff. Rusko, one of the first producers to nudge the sound in this direction, has stepped back: “Brostep is sort of my fault,” he told the BBC, “but now I'm starting to hate it”—Americans, he said, were taking it too far, turning it into an arms race of heaviness, draining the music of richness and subtlety. James Blake, a highbrow British producer whose debut LP sounded more like an elegant singer-songwriter's, told the Boston Phoenix that the American scene had “hit upon a sort of frat-boy market where there's this macho-ism being reflected in the sounds.” (He suspected this would not appeal to women, which I think misunderstands certain things about how both dance music and gender work in America.) The word “soul” comes up a lot: This American sound is all big, sick, melt-your-face-off noises, and no soul.
One doesn't hear a lot of soul in an act like Skrillex; that's true. One doesn't hear the long, sensual pacing of dance music, either—his tracks surely get all that Facebook play because they shoot straight for the three-minute flash and bang of a rock single, not the elegant build and release of tension. But some of electronic music's biggest bursts of ideas have come from eras of populist face-melting. Take, for instance, the original, early-90s heyday of British raves, when thousands of kids—many of whom had never much cared about dance music before—would flock to empty fields in search of relentless, alarm-sounding music, and the process of trying to keep them excited kept leading to the invention of fascinating sounds. (Even the epithet “brostep” puts me in mind of a graceless, hard-pounding, and fairly lovable techno from that era—“gabber,” which comes from a Dutch term that means basically the same thing as “bro.”) When you have huge numbers of people flocking to one spot with the agenda of getting messed up and hearing something crushing and spectacular, the race to please them stands a chance of rushing out on limbs and creating new things. You don't hear much of that in Skrillex, or among many of his peers; so far, there are just a lot of collisions and amplifications of sounds we've already heard. But that's what people said about our mess-headed emo and hardcore scenes at the start of the century, and they rapidly became their own weird world.
President Vladimir V. Putin approved the adoption ban in late December as part of a broader law retaliating against the United States for the so-called Magnitsky Act, an effort to punish Russian officials accused of human rights violations.
Russian leaders have complained bitterly for years about what they consider light sentences in cases where American parents abused or neglected children adopted from Russia, and named the ban after Dmitri Yakovlev, a toddler who died of heatstroke in Virginia in 2008 after his adoptive father left him in a parked car for nine hours.
But the decision has proved to be controversial in Russia, even within government circles. More than 650,000 children live in foster care or orphanages in Russia, of whom about 120,000 are eligible for adoption. Many children in orphanages are sick or disabled, and most have little hope of finding permanent homes.
“We hope that these people, who came out to express their opinion, are aware of the plans of our nation's leaders to bring order to the adoption process, and the implementation of a range of measures aimed to improve the lives of orphans,” said Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin press secretary.
The protesters on Sunday, however, were not likely to be convinced. One woman carried a sign that said, “Stop the repressions, you're making revolutionaries out of us.” Many said they supported the Magnitsky Act, which American lawmakers passed late last year, as a way to hold Russian officials accountable for crimes that would otherwise never be punished.
“I truly think they have lost touch with society, and they use these laws to divert society's anger toward ‘our enemies,' the Americans,” said Boris Komberg, a physicist who was distributing a poem he had written about the adoption issue.
Yelena Rostova, 61, said anger over the ban had caught the authorities by surprise.
“They expected that, as usual, we would swallow it, keep quiet,” Ms. Rostova said. “We have had two weeks to think about this law, and not everyone understood right away, but as time passed, people realized what it means to leave invalids, sick children, in Russia, where there is no help. Everyone knows what kind of medicine we have here.”
Unboxing and First Impressions of HG 1/144 RGMGM-79 GM/GM (HGBF)
Release Date: August 2017
Retail Price: MYR 68.00*(USD $16.67*)
*The price is subject to change, depending on the situation
Hello and a very good day to all our readers. Hazim here back again with another unboxing and first impressions, did ya miss me? Ha ha! It has been awhile since I have written anything back when I first did a review for the HG 1/144 Atlas Gundam I figured why not do another HG review and since we have been hearing a lot about the RGMGM-79 GM/GM I thought to myself, why not?
Now why I decided to pick up the GM/GM?
Well, truth to be told, I have been wanting to build a GM kit for quite a while but have not gotten any, I have been interested by a lot of the GM kits and all the GM relatives such as the Jegan and the Rezel, but never have had the chance to do so. Thanks to this blog I finally had a chance to pick one up, and honestly this is really my very first GM kit that I have gotten so far.
Why the interest in GM kits? Oh, just because all the Grunt units in the Gundam series is all awesome AF, don't we all love some awesome Grunt units?
So without wasting more time, let's first talk about the box! As you can see from the front the box art you will see 3 GM/GM's each with a different head and all looking cool looking and hardworking suits.
It is a very typical look for the HG series, where the visuals looked anime-ish, but highlighting 3 variants here made me think that bandai is telling me that there will be 3 kits, but from the looks of it. I don't think that would be possible when you look at how thin the box is….haha.
Its even more obvious when you open up the box and see the runners
Yup you obviously can't make 3 kits with that amount of runners.
Anyways back to the runners, it seems to be same deal here as how it was with the atlas I built previously, the parts for the GM/GM look very detailed. It's strange to see a HG kit of this year getting more and more detailed, I would even say some of the parts reminds me of what I see on the MG counterparts. Impressive. Though as I was going through the parts I did find some issues with my shield part, there seems to have been a bent or scratch issues a bit, I'm not really sure why? But all and all I don't think this is like a big issue but it something that I find a tiny bit annoying.
All and all the runner parts looks awesome overall, I love the detail that you get here and as well the overall colour and the plastic quality. Bandai have really made something of a work of art with this one, and it really made me look forward in getting to work on this.
And now finally let's talk about the manual, at the start you will see the same artwork as the one you see at the boxart but in a much smaller scale of course. Though the meat of this manual is seen when you open up the manual you will see a very gloriously coloured middle page. Oh my god, dat details! Though it is common for the HGBF kits to have this, but this is probably one that I have enjoyed reading thus far! And look at them poses that this kit could do! Ha-ha. Also, I do find that the manual to be very easy to understand, this is a definite plus point for beginners. Oh yeah not to mention, that there is some decent English translations here in the manual so that's another BIG plus point, ha-ha.
I could say at this point of time that I am really psyched to get to work on this kit, there are really lots of things here that made me quite excited on seeing more of and hopefully one that would be a blast to make.
God I am looking forward to this!
With that concludes my review of the HG 1/144 RGMGM-79 GM/GM, what do you guys think of the kit overall? As well as your own experience with HG 1/144 RGMGM-79 GM/GM, do you share my enthusiasm over this awesome HG kit? Did you have fun with it? Do let me know what you think on the comment section below!
Regardless, we do look forward in reading more on your comments and thoughts here! We will be back with more Let's Talk Gunpla Segment on Wednesday and do look forward to my review of the GM/GM on the next coming Sunday!
As ever please do leave us a like if you enjoyed this article, as well do give us some feedback and comment if you think we would be able to improve further in making sure that we can give you more in the near future! As well your likes and shares would be highly appreciated in supporting and helping us grow further, your love and support means the world to all of us here in Kimi the Builder Blog.
We hope by sharing our love for Gunpla would be able to make your day!
Anyways, we shall see you again next week, and we hope that you all have an awesome week and weekend ahead! Have an awesome Gunpla building time there as well and till next time!
Ciao!

A new malware family detected under the name of CoinMiner is causing users and security firms alike loads of problems, being hard to stop or detect due to the combination of various unique features.
The malware — a cryptocurrency miner — uses the EternalBlue NSA exploit to infect victims and the WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) toolkit as a method to run commands on infected systems.
In addition, CoinMiner also runs in memory (fileless malware), and uses multiple layers of command and control servers to deploy the multitude of scripts and components it needs to infect victims.
All of these make a deadly mixture of features that spell trouble for outdated machines and systems running antivirus solutions not up to par with the latest infection techniques.
Avoid getting infected with CoinMiner by disabling SMBv1...
To avoid getting infected with CoinMiner, there are a few precautionary measures that users need to take.
The simplest solution is to prevent the malware's first infection step, which is EternalBlue, an SMB exploit developed by the NSA, leaked online by a hacker group known as The Shadow Brokers, and used in the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware outbreaks.
Users should make sure they have the MS17-010 Microsoft security patch installed, or at least disable the SMBv1 protocol on their systems, so CoinMiner won't have any way of reaching their computers.
... and WMI
In situations where this protocol is crucial for network interoperability, CoinMiner infections can still be avoided if users protect against the malware's second exploitation stage, which is the usage of WMI — a set of tools built into all Windows versions.
CoinMiner uses WMI to download scripts and other components needed to get persistence on each host, and later to download and launch the actual CoinMiner binary.
CoinMiner modus operandi [via Trend Micro]
Trend Micro, the company that discovered CoinMiner this week, recommends disabling WMI on systems where it's not needed, or at least restricting WMI access to only one admin account, accessible to IT staff only.
Guides for disabling both SMBv1 and WMI are available here and here. For the technically inclined, Trend Micro also published a technical report detailing the CoinMiner infection process step by step.
CoinMiner is not the first cryptocurrency miner to use the EternalBlue exploit to infect victims. The Adylkuzz miner was the first, deploying it shortly after The Shadow Brokers leaked it online. On the other hand, CoinMiner is one of the few fileless cryptocurrency miners around.

Dear American political spectator: Please note that TV talking heads find it easier to pontificate upon the horse-race of our presidential sweepstakes than to cover the actual election process . . . much less the public policies being espoused by those men and women seeking your highest office.
“What is Aleppo?” asked Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson, last Thursday, in response to a question on MSNBC's “Morning Joe.” The resultant media mass conniption suggests Gov. Johnson has indeed made it into the running, at least by media standards.
Johnson initially thought Aleppo was an acronym for some ridiculous government bureaucracy he hadn't yet encountered. Once it was explained that Aleppo is a besieged city in Syria, Johnson “got it,” explaining that he opposed the U.S. policy of intervention and regime change in the Middle East.
Perhaps someday a newsperson will ask Hillary Clinton about her role in creating the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo.
What with so much coverage concerning the blank drawn by Johnson about a city in a country he doesn't want to bomb or invade, the entire media missed a bigger story, the one about grassroots citizen action accomplishing a Herculean feat.
Last week, Rhode Island became the 50th state to officially announce that the Libertarian Party presidential ticket, consisting of former two-term Republican governors Gary Johnson of New Mexico for president and Bill Weld of Massachusetts for vice-president, had earned a spot on the ballot.
This is the first time in 20 years that any non-elephant-or-ass party has garnered a place on all state ballots (and the District of Columbia to boot). For four decades, Libertarians have gathered petition signatures in 100-degree heat as well as cold so bitter ballpoint pens freeze up, all to run candidates who spoke from the heart even when their head knew they had no chance to win.
Without this struggle and victory by Libertarians, voters would have no viable alternative to Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, the two least popular nominees in history.
The last few months, various Republicans have frantically sought an independent presidential path. But they discovered no such route was reasonably possible — not so late in the cycle.
Even with multiple millions in cash.
Why should it be so difficult to seek the presidency (or other elected office) without being a Republican or Democrat? Because Republican and Democratic politicians want it that way — and so have legislated it that way. They don't want you to have a choice . . . well, not a choice other than them.
Through blood, sweat, tears and perseverance, Libertarians have nonetheless provided that choice.
Now, that Libertarian choice stands a chance. Nearly 60 percent of the public repeatedly inform pollsters they want to vote for someone other than Trump or Hillary. Even more urgent, the desire to see and hear from Gary Johnson in the three presidential debates — along with Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein.
Meet the private organization, the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), founded and run by Republican and Democratic Party bigwigs. It decides who gets to debate before the American people on television and who does not. With most normal, non-political people hardly fixating about the presidential race until the debates, the private, partisan Commission's determination is tantamount to deciding who may or may not become president.
With all the talk about rigging the election, here it is!
Of course, the CPD claims it has merely set out criteria to prevent all 410 presidential candidates registered with the Federal Election Commission from being on the debate stage. As CPD member and former chairman of the Federal Communication Commission, Newton Minow asked a reporter: “You want to have 410 candidates in the debate?”
The Commission's criteria set is three-fold: (1) the candidate must be constitutionally eligible, (2) on enough state ballots to have a chance mathematically to gain a majority, and (3) garner at least 15 percent in five polls selected by the Commission.
If the last requirement — the 15 percent — were jettisoned, as it should be, only four candidates, not 410, would qualify: Republican Donald Trump, Democrat Hillary Clinton, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Jill Stein.
Seems manageable.
Furthermore, presidents are not elected by national popular vote, but by state-by-state results. So why should national polls have any bearing whatsoever?
Johnson is currently polling at 25 percent in his home state of New Mexico. That's four points below Trump, at 29, and 12 below Hillary at 37 percent. In a very close election, a win for Johnson in one state could throw this whole contest into the House of Representatives. There, the unpopularity of Trump and Hillary might cinch it for the Libertarian.
A chance to debate might also make it possible for enough voters to feel comfortable they know enough about the Libertarian candidate to commit to him, catapulting him into first place or second or a far closer third. Or perhaps his support might plummet and Johnson would no longer be a factor.
But shouldn't the voters decide, rather than a private corporation controlled by the two-party establishment dictating that Johnson will not be heard from?
Numerous newspapers, usually skeptical toward Libertarians, have either endorsed the Johnson/Weld ticket or emphatically called for Johnson's inclusion in the debates. The GOP's previous standard-bearer, Mitt Romney has advocated having Johnson in the debates.
What does Trump say? Well, back in 2000, Mr. Trump made his position clear, calling the CPD's 15 percent threshold, which excludes third party candidates, “disgraceful.” Trump added, “It's amazing that they can get away with it. I just think it's unfair to have such a high standard, a high criterion. . . . Very unfair.”
Most recently, Trump told the Washington Post that he preferred to debate Hillary one-on-one. Might not be the best approach, however, since in polls Mrs. Clinton consistently loses more support than does Trump when the Libertarian and Green candidates are included.
What do you think? It's your country. Call the Commission on Presidential Debates that is hijacking your political process (202-282-1020). Don't be just a spectator.
Feddah Lootah, the acting director general of the National Human Resource Development and Employment Authority (Tanmia), said Emiratis would feel more secure in their jobs knowing they cannot be laid off. As a result, they will "increase their productivity, performance and loyalty". Companies will become aware of that trend and will recruit more Emiratis, she said.
Last week I laughed out loud to read that a group of Emiratis lodged an official complaint because they were laid off by their employer. One of the sacked Emiratis said: "Emiratis should be protected through legislation during such hard times. We should have these rights as UAE citizens. I find it strange that we should lose jobs in our own country."Can you imagine making that argument in the US? "Hey, you can't lay me off! I'm an American citizen!"Well, I'm not laughing anymore: the UAE just made it illegal for a private company to lay off an Emirati if there's a non-Emirati doing the same job. So, say your company's widget-maker, Sanjeev, is overworked so you hire an Emirati, Abdullah, to make widgets too. Then widget sales decrease and you have to lay one off. Surprise! It's now illegal to keep Sanjeev.Additionally, according to the Financial Times , "private companies will only be able to dismiss UAE nationals for serious misconduct, including, among other reasons, absenteeism, theft or drunkenness." Despite the fact that Dubai's economy is pretty much in free-fall , "The economic downturn will not be reason enough to make Emirati staff redundant."What about Emiratis who don't engage in "serious misconduct" but who simply aren't doing their jobs? They can't be fired either, "but must be given more training or transferred to work more suited to their skills," reports The National . I'm desperately curious to see how that would pan out: "Sorry, Abdullah, but we've determined your skills are more suited to a different role. The mop's in the hall closet."For all their desperation to make sure their citizens are gainfully employed in the private sector, the Gulf governments seem to do a spectacular job creatingincentives to hire locals. Emiratis were already pretty much unfireable, and now they're un-layoff-able, too: if I were hiring Sanjeev's assistant, why on earth would I hire an Emirati? As always, the government's approach is to make hiring a local extremely burdensome and then require companies to do it anyway, instead of to offer incentives that would make hiring a national inherently appealing.Amazingly, though, the UAE government thinks the new law will actually incentivize hiring Emiratis! According to that The Nation article,Um, yeah. Nothing increases a worker's performance and loyalty more than knowing they have a job for life no matter how much they screw up!
Hammer Architects Design A Home In The Forest With Abundant Natural Light
Hammer Architects have designed the North Pamet Ridge House, that is surrounded by woodland in Truro, Massachusetts.
From the architects
This two story, four-bedroom residence is sited along a high ridge surrounded by dense woodland. The client desired a home, which would function as a weekend retreat, accommodate single floor living and provide abundant natural light.
The design evolved to become an upside-down house with guest rooms on the lower level and the living spaces and master bedroom above.
he simple shape with its nine and twelve gable roof can be viewed as an extruded Cape Cod cottage while the exposed wood structure recalls rustic cabins.
Extensive use of glass opens the home to the outdoors and in turn offers long vistas and cooling breezes.
The end of the form opens to a screened in porch, which is accessed via a large sliding glass wall that is concealed behind the fireplace when open. This transition further blurs the distinction between inside and outside.

On Saturday, my wife and I put on our boots and trudged through two feet of snow to meet with thousands of other people at Flagstaff City Hall. There were signs, chants, and, yes, Pussy Hats to go around, and there were babies and children and men, and a number of my students who I hugged and high-fived as we passed one another in the streets.
Meanwhile, my sister, and my mother were marching in my native Chicago. Mom suffers from a pair of bad knees, she had a respiratory infection, and has never cared for crowds; still she got on the crammed Blue Line and headed downtown to join in the protest. (She even texted me pictures.) Mom is nearly seventy. She lived through Vietnam War protests and the second-wave women's marches, but this, in 2017, was the first demonstration she had ever attended. I was incredibly proud of her.
When my wife and I arrived home that evening, we felt energized and hopeful and clear. It's always reassuring to know one is not alone in their sorrow and despair, and it's even better when one is given the sense that democracy can work, will work, does work if people are energized and determined.
As I relaxed with a bottle of beer, I did what most of us do these days to commemorate: I posted to Facebook.
Long ago, I scrubbed my FB Friends list of people who routinely posted misogynist memes, who embraced and celebrated the mean-spirited rhetoric of Trump, who espoused racist convictions. I know those people exist; I just don't want to be inundated with their ugliness every time I check my Facebook account.
Alas, no sooner had the marches ended, then the appallingly misogynist memes and status updates and article shares began populating my feed. And this was from people I deemed reasonable, rational, and fundamentally good - if not right leaning.
There was much feigned outrage about how "offensive" the protester's signs were (never mind the outrage was coming from men and women who seemed to have zero problem with Donald Trump's brand of offensiveness), and much feigned outrage over the signs women left outside the White House gates. The implication was that "these nasty women littered."
I noticed that a former colleague had posted a photo of the signs marchers had left behind for Trump, asking, "What's this all about?"
He's a smart man. He knew what "it" was "all about."
His post received 95 replies. 99% of those respondents were white, presumably heterosexual, men.
Maybe I shouldn't have read the replies. Maybe I should have simply deleted my former colleague from my feed, but I didn't.
What I read, in this particular thread, was gut-wrenching, sickening, was - even for a jaded forty-year-old woman like me - shocking.
Men bemoaned the fact that they should ever have to pay into (much less care about) women's birth control and reproductive healthcare. Men suggested that feminists "want more and more rights but no responsibility." Men even lamented that women have the vote - one arguing in his best academese that women "legislate morality" and are perhaps too emotional to vote sensibly. These were (or so I thought) arguments from a former century.
And these were educated, articulate men, men with rhetorical prowess, the kind of men who, when they ascribe to these antiquated beliefs, and when they hold office, pose the greatest threat to women's liberation and rights.
Reading the thread further confirmed what I know, but what some part of me doesn't really want to believe: lots of men don't see women as human.
For many men, women themselves are an issue, a problem to be solved, an abstraction, a collection of bewildering otherness with strange and frightening body parts.
I want the exception - the good, decent, kind men I know - to be the rule. But they're not.
Of the few women who chimed in on the post, all were quick to say, "I don't agree with these women [the protesters], but..." or "did you know that feminists are fighting for men, too?" - they had to apologize to the men for agreeing with "those women" or prioritize men and their feelings before expressing their own thoughts. So much of our lives, as women, are spent apologizing, spent assuring men we are really but an addendum. I understand why we do this - we do this because of female socialization, we do this for our own safety. We also do this, as my wife observed, because we get "patriarchy points" when we, as women, side with men and say, "Oh, no. I don't agree with those women."
I try not to engage on Facebook in political disagreements. The act is likely never productive. No hearts and minds are changed by a comment on a status, but there was something so starkly horrifying, so insidious about the nature of this particular thread that I couldn't help myself. I replied. This is what I said:
1) The abandoned signs were not litter, and you know this. They were left as messages for the incoming president and his administration. They were left as evidence that "we were here" - in spite of all "alternative facts" to the contrary. Protesters have done this sort of thing many times before. (The most moving example I can think of is when AIDS Activists launched the ashes of their loved ones over the White House fence and onto the lawn as a way to "force" Ronald Reagan to at least acknowledge people were dying.)
2) These were not marches "about abortion" or "about gaining more rights" -- rather, they were about creating/sustaining awareness of the tenuousness of the rights women do have. I know for most straight, white men the notion of "losing rights" is beyond their grasp. This makes sense. Straight white men are in no danger of losing any rights. As a class of people, women are often in danger of having the rights they've tirelessly fought for casually and callously stripped away by white men who don't care because they don't see women as fully formed human beings, but rather as irrational collections of fallopian tubes and ovaries (which, as at least one person in this thread suggested, women should be fiscally punished for possessing).
3) This was also a protest calling attention to the systemic violence and misogyny women face. Misogyny can't be legislated out of existence. If you don't believe misogyny and sex-based violence exists, I'd suggest talking to a woman. Any woman. (However, given the tone many men have taken here in re: the status of women, I doubt there are many women who'd be willing to tell you the truth.) The fact that the man who now holds the highest office in the land openly boasted about sexually assaulting women is deeply troubling, and also evidence of male supremacy -- i.e. when it comes to women and girls, men can do/say whatever they want to with impunity.
4) I see in this thread men, white (I'm presuming) and heterosexual (I'm presuming) pontificating on everything from "What more do women want?" to "Should women have gotten the vote?" (and to that commenter: yes, you're right; many women believed -- and still do -- that women shouldn't have the vote; women often participate in their own oppression, that's how patriarchy works best!), and minimizing the protests by joking about "women leaving messes" and putting forth stereotypes about women as though they were facts. But here's something that may BLOW YOUR MIND: Women are actually human beings. Did you know that women are actual human beings with thoughts and feelings and hopes and ambitions and skills and talents and varying perspectives? Did you know they're not mere philosophical abstractions or reproductive organs floating in space? Did you know they're human beings who are allowed (for now) to organize around ideas, principles, and causes that don't center men? It's amazing! We're actually human. Once men understand that basic fact (and it is a fact), they might be less bewildered by our outrage.
The man in the thread who - yes, really - questioned whether women should have gotten voting rights, and the man in the thread who - yes, really - suggested women should have to pay more for healthcare because our reproductive systems are "more complicated" were predictably silent. Other men responded with gratitude. Many women, even those who had commented in the thread that they "didn't agree with the protesters, but," clicked "like" in a show of soft solidarity, I suppose.
Here's the thing, though: I don't really care.
Sometimes speaking out isn't about persuasion, isn't about getting people to "come to your side" or change their own hard held perspectives. There are some perspectives that, however hateful and hurtful and outmoded, will never be altered.
Did Donald Trump read any of the signs left at his doorstep? Did it even register in his heart that women (and men) came out in droves to assert their presence, to give voice to their lives and their legitimate fears that the new administration may be willing to strip us, as a class, of so many important, essential gains? Likely not. Does this mean we stop speaking out? We stop marching? We stop fighting? Hell no.
The fight isn't about Trump singularly any more than my lengthy Facebook comment was about the men on the thread who giddily asserted that women were silly and hysterical and maybe shouldn't even have the vote.
Now playing: Watch this: Micro drones race through a former 'Firefly' spaceship
There's nothing quite like stepping onto a set from one of your favorite TV shows -- so when I walked onto a fully lit spaceship set from the show "Firefly" to check out DR1 Racing's Micro Series, I had to contain my geek glee a little bit.
It's a great idea, using set pieces from popular shows both inactive and on-air. DR1 already zoomed its micro drones around the set of "Colony" recently with stars Josh Holloway and Sarah Wayne Callies, and it plans to continue creating cinematic, exciting tracks for tiny drones to race through. DR1 already has its Champions Series, which uses full-size drones; if that's the heavyweight class, the Micro Series would be akin to a lightweight circuit. These palm-size quadcopters have tiny bumpers around the propellers, encouraging pilots to fly a little more dangerously and make bolder moves as they zip around the elaborate tracks.
So what's the point of a Micro Series, if DR1 has a standard drone series? Accessibility. DR1 hopes broadcasting races like these will inspire a new generation of drone racers to the sport, since it's an emerging industry with lots of growth options; plus, the point of entry for micro drone racing is substantially lower than a full-sized racing kit. If you're considering getting into drone racing, micro drones might be a good way to test out your mettle and work on your reflexes before moving onto larger quadcopters.
DR1 plans to broadcast the Micro Series sometime later this year, and will announce channels and region availability as they finalize it. For now, check out our day on set in the video -- even though "Firefly" is long gone from our television screens, it's nice to know it's living on in a way even Captain Malcolm Reynolds himself could approve of.

There's an amazing diversity of greeting customs around the world. In Tibet sticking out your tongue can be a way of welcoming people. In New Zealand, Maori greet each other by touching noses. Ethiopian men touch shoulders, and in the Democratic Republic of Congo, male friends touch foreheads. In many Asian countries, people bow to each other when meeting. And in some European countries, as well as Arab countries, hugs or kisses on the cheek are more the norm. While this wasn't always true, the most common physical way to greet people around the world is now the handshake.
It's become so ubiquitous that you may never have thought about why people shake hands. The history of the handshake dates back to the 5th century B.C. in Greece. It was a symbol of peace, showing that neither person was carrying a weapon. During the Roman era, the handshake was actually more of an arm grab. It involved grabbing each other's forearms to check that neither man had a knife hidden up his sleeve. Some say that the shaking gesture of the handshake started in Medieval Europe. Knights would shake the hand of others in an attempt to shake loose any hidden weapons.
While handshaking is still the most ubiquitous greeting around the world, it may be losing ground in the US. The fist bump was, until recently, a gesture mostly used by athletes and young people. Now it's becoming more and more common among everyone, including older people. Even the President of the United States is a fan of the fist bump. According to one survey, forty nine percent of Americans sometimes choose the fist bump over a traditional handshake greeting. The fist bump, made by making a fist and lightly touching knuckles, may be a more fashionable greeting, but for many it's a pragmatic choice. Many survey participants said they preferred the fist bump because they were afraid of catching germs by shaking hands. How do people greet each other in your country? Is the fist bump catching on where you live?
Volkswagen India gives a response on Twitter, saying its account got compromised following the sly deletion of a sexist tweet it made 4 days ago
There's a new twist to the Volkswagen India fiasco on Twitter. Today, as the clock struck noon, Volkswagen India decided the time is ripe for a response for the sexist tweet it made three days ago on the 11th of September. The German automobile major isn't saying a ‘sorry' yet.
“Our Volkswagen twitter handle got compromised. We officially distance ourselves from it. We are investigating this issue”, said the official Twitter handle @VolkswagenIndia.
Our Volkswagen twitter handle got compromised. We officially distance ourselves from it. We are investigating this issue. — Volkswagen India (@volkswagenindia) September 14, 2012
Let us assume this is true, just for once. So what do we comprehend here?
It took them three harrowing days to come up with a response. It took them three days and two nights to discover their Twitter handle had been compromised. And that they are still investigating the issue.
Either Volkswagen considers us to be absolute idiots or they must be planning on an exit strategy soon. I am convinced of the latter since the statement by Volkswagen on Twitter, is a complete desecration of online reputation management.
In the rule book of online reputation management, Rule no. 1 is to apologise immediately. Volkswagen does not feel the need to apologise as their Twitter handle was compromised. Rule no. 2 is to offer a resolution. Since it wasn't their fault, there is no need for a resolution.
Should Volkswagen be held accountable?
Let us go back to that fateful day. The vibrating devices attached by Volkswagen in the leading morning newspapers, had set off vibrations in the offline world. While many were pleasantly surprised with this ‘vibrating' introduction of the new Vento and Polo, a majority were annoyed or took digs at the Volkswagen India Twitter handle, around the indirect sexual implications of the brand message.
Someone handling the VW Twitter got all steamed up and retaliated with a sexist tweet – “Women would be dumb to call it a vibrator. Or maybe they do not understand real driving experience. #PunIntended #Volkswagen #Creative”.
That someone forgot to apologise even after the uproar caused by that tweet. Volkswagen India could have easily saved the day by a mere apology. But it chose to delete the said tweet on the sly and went mum. Both rules governing online reputation management have been broken.
Today, after three and a half days precisely, the brand gives some statement but refuses to be accountable for its actions. Assuming that the account was indeed compromised upon, the issued statement does not reflect even an iota of concern for its consumers. The brand has not only severely compromised on its relationship with consumers, but has also received a massive hit on its reputation.
A ‘sorry' could have shut the lid but this delayed statement has just opened up the Pandora's box in social media. Let's wait and watch what is unearthed by their investigation.
FLINT, MI - "How are you feelin'?" longtime F.W.C. Berston boxing coach Paul Lesears asked.
"I'm all right," Chris Greenwood said, smirking.
As sweat drenched his athletic frame, the 27-year-old was exhausted.
The former Detroit Lions fifth-round draft pick from Albion College just completed an 85-minute boxing workout in the basement of Flint's Berston Field House on Tuesday evening.
Greenwood started with three miles, then banged out sessions of heavy bag training, combinations, speed bag punching, sit ups, bicycle crunches and medicine ball bouncing.
"You're definitely going to have an edge," Lesears told Greenwood. "Some people don't work out in the off-season, so you will definitely have an edge on them."
On Feb. 21, the Canadian Football League's Winnipeg Blue Bombers added Greenwood to their training camp roster. Greenwood, a Motown native drafted as a cornerback, also played with the practice squad last season.
A three-day minicamp is coming up in April, training camp begins in May then the 2017 season starts in June. Greenwood still must earn his spot but he's ready for the challenge with a fresh set of goals.
"To get that starting spot, get some good film and hopefully to transition back to the NFL somehow," Greenwood listed. "As far as my team goals, it's all about winning. Whatever I do, it's going to be solely to help the team."
Detroit released the former Albion College star in 2013 after he missed his entire rookie season because of abdominal surgery, and then he strained his hamstring the second year.
The 6-foot-1 and 195-pound cornerback also had brief stints with the Dallas Cowboys, Minnesota Vikings, Baltimore Ravens and New England Patriots before taking the CFL route.
When thinking of ways to prepare, Greenwood reached out to his uncle and former NBA veteran Jeff Grayer for advice. They agreed that boxing would be the perfect method of training.
"I was just thinking boxing can get me some quick hands, footwork and all of that," Greenwood said. "This is Flint, so Jeff knows all the good places to go and told me to come down here."
As a diehard Lions fan, Lesears was more than happy to train his first football player with professional experience. So many of his boxing techniques can translate over to the gridiron.
"He's playing cornerback, so that's like a one-on-one battle every down," Lesears said. "If it's a run play, somebody is trying to block him. If it's a pass play, he has to chase somebody.
"He's going to be light years ahead of them. He already breezes through his football workouts now and doesn't get tired now."
Greenwood lives in Detroit but works for the Flint-based WT Stevens Construction company when he's not training at Berston or First Class Athletics on Richfield Road with Jerry Robinson.
Greenwood assists the company with the lead pipe replacement amid the city's ongoing water crisis, but would rather play football for his everyday 9-5.
"It's fun," Greenwood said. "It's football. It's what I love to do."
A White House-appointed task force is to recommend an overhaul of the National Security Agency, including changing the controversial bulk phone record collection and giving it civilian leadership, according to a Wall Street Journal report.
The panel of experts called the Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technology was called in August in response to the public revelations of the NSA's mass electronic surveillance by whistleblower Edward Snowden.
The five-strong task force is to submit its recommendations to the Obama administration on Saturday, but the document is not yet finalized, and it's not clear how much of it the White House chooses to make public.
The newspaper was given an overview of the panel's recommendations by four people familiar with the draft. If the US administration chooses to follow on the non-binding suggestions, it would mean a lot of changes for how the key US intelligence agency works.
The experts recommended forbidding the US from collecting and storing millions of phone call records of Americans. Instead the records would be held by phone companies or a third party, with NSA receiving access to select data after meeting a new higher standard of proof.
The task force also suggested changing NSA leadership from military to civilian. Currently the agency is part of the Pentagon's Cyber Command, the main military cyber-warfare unit.
Another suggestion is to separate NSA's Information Assurance Directorate, the part responsible for code-making, from the rest of the agency. This would help to avoid a conflict of interests, in which one component of the agency is developing and promoting new encryption methods and other communication security protocols while another is tasked with cracking them.
The panel suggested reviewing NSA's procedures for issuing security clearances. The intelligence agency came under fire after it was revealed that Snowden was given his clearance, which allowed him to leak classified documents detailing the surveillance programs, despite having been red-flagged.
Other provisions of the draft address concerns by US' foreign allies, who voiced anger after finding out, that their leaders and citizens were subject of NSA's snooping. Germany and Brazil were among the most vocal critics of NSA over the tapping of phones of Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Dilma Rousseff respectively. The experts suggest developing international norms for government activity in cyberspace and rules for cyber-warfare.
The members of the task force are Richard Clarke, a longtime US counterterrorism chief; Michael Morell, former CIA deputy director; Geoffrey Stone, University of Chicago law professor; Cass Sunstein, former White House regulatory official; and Peter Swire, a former economic and privacy official.
The Obama administration said it would consider the task force suggesting in its own review of intelligence policies. The review is expected to be complete by the end of the year.
When Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries last month rejected calls for a production cut by Opec, the oil cartel, they put the responsibility for stabilising plummeting crude prices on to the US shale industry. Suhail al-Mazroui, energy minister for the United Arab Emirates, said US shale companies and other producers who had created an oil glut should “respect the needs of the market”. Less diplomatically, Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, one of the leading shale oil producers, said Opec had “declared war” on the US industry.
Two weeks on from that Opec decision — and against a backdrop of a 40 per cent fall in the oil price since June — evidence of its negative impact on US producers is starting to emerge.
Rather than a war, the US shale industry is braced for a test of endurance. As the pressure on oil producers mounts, weak companies face the threat of dwindling investment, faltering production, forced asset sales and possible bankruptcy.
The successful companies will be the ones that both entered the downturn in the strongest position and are most effective at improving their efficiency. They can hope to make it through to better days when the oil price recovers and are also likely to be able to pick up some undervalued assets.
On Monday ConocoPhillips, the US's largest exploration and production company, unveiled plans to cut its capital spending by about 20 per cent next year to $13.5bn — a steeper reduction than analysts had expected — and said it would defer drilling programmes in several North American shale areas.
Last Friday Baker Hughes, the energy services group due to be bought by rival Halliburton, published data which showed the number of rigs drilling for oil in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas had fallen by 16 since October to 190. The number of rigs in the Bakken shale and related North Dakota formations had meanwhile dropped by 10 to 188.
Also last week Drillinginfo, a consultancy, published figures showing that the number of new permits to drill wells had fallen by about 30 per cent in both the Bakken and the Eagle Ford areas last month compared with October. That may overstate the likely drop in activity, because companies will have a backlog of permits they can use, but it is clear the industry is responding to a steep drop in the oil price.
Allen Gilmer, Drillinginfo's chief executive, said: “Because production from shale wells comes on fast and drops off fast, their economics are more exposed to short-term prices.” This applies more than for other types of oil production, where projects can take many years to come on stream, activity and output from shale can be stepped up and down quickly.

While all shale companies are under pressure, their responses to the declining oil price will often be different. The companies vary widely in terms of debt levels, financing, hedging against price falls, product mix, location and quality of their assets and operational efficiency, and those differences have been reflected in share price movements over the past six months.
One important issue for companies is their gas production. From 2010 until this summer, many US shale companies were shifting away from natural gas and towards more lucrative oil production.
But now gas is back in favour. It has fallen less than oil and is likely to rebound if there is a cold winter in the US. As a result, the shares of gas-focused companies such as Cabot Oil and Gas have often been less affected than their more oil-focused peers.
Another critical factor is debt. The shale surge has been built by borrowing: companies have typically spent more on drilling and completing wells than they have generated in cash flows and over the past decade about $163bn worth of high-yield debt has been issued by US oil and gas producers. Some have relied much more heavily on debt than others, however.
If US crude were to average about $70 per barrel next year, EOG Resources and Anadarko Petroleum would have debts roughly equal to a year's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation — a very comfortable level, according to analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt, the investment bank. Other larger companies including Marathon Oil, Apache, Devon Energy and Chesapeake Energy also have debt burdens that seem manageable.
At the other end of the scale, companies such as Laredo Petroleum, SandRidge Energy and Range Resources would have debts about four times their ebitda, according to Tudor Pickering, while for Ultra Petroleum, Exco Resources, Goodrich Petroleum and Halcon Resources the multiple would be even higher.
Beyond the financial metrics, the quality of a company's assets is also important. Some of the companies that are focused on the Bakken shale, including Continental Resources and Whiting Petroleum, have been out of favour with investors, but the early evidence from rig activity and drilling permits is that there is no one “play” — as the different geological formations are known — that has been worse affected than any other.

More than the broad region where a company operates, it can be the quality of its specific lease areas within the region that matters, according to Cody Rice of Wood Mackenzie, another consultancy. In an area such as the Eagle Ford, companies in the core where the rocks are most productive can continue to thrive, he says, “but if you're underperforming your peers, and you're not in the core of the play, it's not going to be so good for you”.
The other crucial variable is operational performance. Reid Morrison, the advisory leader for US energy at PwC, the accounting firm, says that up until this summer there was very little focus on efficiency in the shale industry. When he tried to advise on cost savings, “the reaction we were getting was: ‘We agree with that, but it's not important right now',” he says. “There was a lot of confidence that the new floor for the oil price was around $90 per barrel.” Now that view has changed completely: interest in ideas for cost savings is soaring.
Market upheaval: Unwelcome newcomer is likely here to stay
When Opec members talk about the US contribution to world “oversupply”, they are referring to the growth in US crude production of about 4m barrels per day, about 80 per cent, since 2008. US shale has caused an upheaval in oil markets, and many rival producers, in Russia as well as Opec, hope it will go away.
The existence of a group of financially strong shale companies such as EOG Resources and Devon Energy, however, suggests that the US industry is not about to crumble. They have been covering their capital spending from cash flow generation, unlike many of their rivals, and have little debt. They may cut capex next year, but do not face pressure to make deep reductions.
Any good US shale assets owned by companies that cannot afford to develop them are likely to be picked up by financially stronger groups. If these can drive down costs, helped by increased spare capacity in the energy services industry, the oil prices needed for development to be commercially attractive could be lower than previous estimates have suggested.
Many investors will suffer losses on exposure to oil and gas if prices stay at current levels. But some analysts expect the overall impact on US oil production to be relatively modest.
“The rate of increase in production is going to slow down,” says Philip Verleger, an energy economist. “Even at $50 oil, though, US production probably plateaus, but it doesn't start going down.”
The numbers speak for themselves:
Eagles: 7-5
Texans 2-10
Its no coincidence that the Texans have gone from Superbowl contender to Teddy Bridgewater favorites in 6 short months.
On the flip side the Eagles were 4-12 last year and have made no significant changes besides for adding the NFL's greatest hipster (and a minor coaching change).
At the time of the signing you went on and on about how his sack numbers were down and how he was overrated, - classic stat nerd.
But what you failed to understand is that intangibles that having the NFL's #1 hipster on your roster brings to an organization. Once the Texas stopped listening to Animal Collective and going to music festivals, things have gone downhill, and FAST.
Tonight when the Jaguars beat the Texans by 30 on National TV you will wish they had some artisinal cheeses and locally brined pickles in the lockerroom during the pregame.
A Japanese artist who made figures of Lady Gaga and a kayak modeled on her vagina said on Wednesday from jail she was "outraged" by her arrest and vowed a court fight against obscenity charges.
Megumi Igarashi, 42, says she was challenging a culture of "discrimination" against discussion of the vagina in Japanese society.
Igarashi, who worked under the alias Rokudenashiko, which means "good-for-nothing girl" in Japanese, built a yellow kayak with a top shaped like her vagina after raising about $10,000 through crowdfunding.

Igarashi sent 3D printer data of her scanned vagina - the digital basis for her kayak project - as a thanks to a number of donors.
She was arrested for distributing indecent material on Saturday and faces up to two years in prison and a fine of up to $25,000.
Igarashi said about 10 police officers had arrived at her house on Saturday and initially, she thought they were only interested in confiscating work she has said is meant as a pop-art exploration of the "manko", vulgar Japanese slang for vagina.
"I couldn't stop myself from laughing a little as I explained to the grim-looking officers, 'This is the Lady Gaga 'manko' figure'," Igarashi told Reuters from across a plastic security divide in a central Tokyo jail.
"I did not expect to get arrested at all. Even as they were confiscating my works, I thought to myself, 'This will be a good story'. Then they handcuffed and arrested me. Now, I just feel outraged."
More than 17,000 people have signed an online petition for Igarashi's immediate release on Change.org, an online platform for grassroots petitions associated with liberal causes.
Igarashi wore black trousers and a sweatshirt provided by police. She said she was allowed to shower twice a week and was eating toast, jam and juice because she did not have money to pay for extra dishes like curry.
She can be detained until the end of July before charges are filed.
BATTLE
Igarashi has touched off a debate on both women's rights and the freedom of artistic expression, said Kazuyuki Minami, her lead defense lawyer.
The legal definition of what counts as obscenity is vague in Japan, and the key point of debate will be deciding whether the vagina itself can be considered obscene, said Minami.
"It will be a difficult battle," Minami said.
Although Japan has an extensive pornography industry, it remains regulated by a section of the criminal code that dates back to 1907. Video pornography in Japan has often used digital mosaics to obscure genitalia in sex scenes as a way to avoid obscenity charges.
A 1951 Supreme Court case broadly defined obscenity as something that stimulates desire and violates an ordinary person's sense of sexual shame and morality.
Igarashi's arrest comes at a time when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pushed to increase the participation of women in the work force and executive positions to bolster the economy.
Igarashi says she began making artwork to address what she saw as a double standard applied to both female and male genitalia in Japan.
The vagina "has been such a taboo in Japanese society", she wrote on her website. "It's been overly hidden although it's just a part of a woman's body."
During a jail visit by friends, Igarashi asked for a copy of a manga comic book of essays she wrote on how she became a "decorative vagina" artist to give to her cell-mate.
She said she was already planning to write about her experience behind bars.

Net users angry at the introduction of the Stop Online Piracy Act, also known as the "E-Parasites Act," are attempting to force the White House to oppose the bill, which would boost the government's authority to disrupt and shutter alleged trademark- and copyright-infringing websites.
And by the early results, it looks like they might at least force the administration to respond.
The petitioners are taking advantage of the newly created White House petition site, which promises Americans it will respond to grievances if the government gets 25,000 signatures in a month's time. Though it was created only Monday, the petition has been signed by more than 4,400 citizens as of 11 a.m. Tuesday morning Pacific Standard Time. The "Stop the E-Parasites Act" petition has until Nov. 30 to get the necessary support.
The petition says, "This Bill would allow essentially allow (sic) A great Firewall of America and would be a shameful desecration of free speech and any sort of reasonable copyright law."
The legislation at issue was introduced last week by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas). The measure grants private parties the right to cut off ad dollars to sites they say host pirated or trademarked content. Among other things, it also empowers the government to order search engines and ISPs to make it impossible for users to reach blacklisted sites.
But it's unclear how honestly the administration would respond if the necessary signatures are gathered. The White House has come under attack for issuing bland and canned responses to petitions.
There's even a different petition that expires Nov. 27 asking the administration to "Actually take these petitions seriously instead of just using them as an excuse to pretend you are listening."
Smith's bill is slated to be heard in the House Judiciary Committee on Nov. 16.
“We are going to the Moon forever,” the Russian Deputy PM said in April, and it was not just empty words. It appears Russia does plan to colonize the Moon by 2030 and the first stage of the ambitious project may start as soon as two years from now.
That is according to a leaked draft document that Izvestia newspaper claims to have obtained. It was prepared by the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Roscosmos federal space agency, Moscow State University and a number of space research institutes.
“Moon is a space object of the future reclamation by Earth civilization, and in XXI century there might be a geopolitical competition for lunar natural resources,” the authors of the draft project state in the opening line.
This is why it is important to focus on creating an arsenal of necessary means in advance, they stress.
“The Moon is not an intermediate point in the race,” Russia's Deputy PM Dmitry Rogozin who is in charge of space and defence industries said back in April. “This process has the beginning, but has no end. We are going to the moon forever.”
The Concept of Russian Lunar Program, as it is titled according to the paper, outlines a three-step plan toward manning the moon.
The first stage is planned to start in 2016 and last until 2025. This is when Russia, should everything go well, will send four automated rovers to the moon Luna-25, Luna-26, Luna-27 and Luna-28.
As the document states, earlier Soviet and American lunar expeditions established that the Moon contains aluminum, iron, titan, and many other useful elements. Scientist think it will be possible to mine some of the Moon's natural resources for terrestrial use.
The first lunar bases will be built in the vicinity of moon's poles, authors assume, because they are the areas of tangential lighting which means the polar mountains will be the “areas of continuous lighting” while the plains will be in shadow.
The task of the first stage of the Russian Moon program would be to conduct tests into the physical and chemical properties of lunar polar regolith and water content as well as to scope out the South Pole in order to find the best mineral rich spot for a future deployment of a lunar base.
The second stage of exploration, planned between 2029-30, envisions sending manned missions to the moon's orbit. The researchers however are not planning landings on the lunar surface at that stage. For this stage the Russian Rocket Space Corporation Energiya is developing a heavy piloted cargo spaceship.
The expeditions planned for a third stage between 2030-2040 include a visit by cosmonauts to the selected site on the Moon surface to survey the area and set up the initial elements of the base's infrastructure. At this stage the construction of a space and Earth monitoring observatory on the Moon will also begin, according to the plan.
The cost for the first stage of the mission is expected to be around 28.5 billion rubles ($815.8 million). Russia would hope to attract private investors to help finance the project, the report said, as it will need to finance the building of the spaceship that according to 2012 estimates would add 160 billion rubles ($4.5 billion)
But while potentially wanting to enlist foreign sponsors, the authors of the project stresses that the “independence of the national lunar program must be ensured regardless of the conditions and the extent of the participation in it by foreign partners.”
Roscosmos told Izvestia that the draft proposals to the Federal space program will undergo a comprehensive expert examination before the project is submitted to the government.
Philanthropist and former entertainment executive Cindra Ladd wrote an op-ed on Monday accusing Bill Cosby of drugging and raping her back in 1969. The embattled comedian has now been accused of rape, sexual assault or drugging by approximately 30 women, with many of them only coming forward in recent months.
“It was obvious to me that he had had sex with me,” she wrote in a Huffington Post blog. “I was horrified, embarrassed and ashamed. There was a mirror above the bed, which shocked me further.”

Ladd, wife of Oscar-winning Hollywood producer Alan Ladd Jr. (“Blade Runner”), said she met Cosby while he was married and she was a single, 21-year-old New York City resident. She said she gave him her number willingly and the two started hanging out, eating hot dogs together and sharing pizza.
One night they were supposed to see a movie, but she said she had a “terrible headache.” He offered her a pill.
“I asked a couple of times what it was,” she wrote. “Each time he reassured me, asking, ‘Don't you trust me?' Of course I did. This was Bill Cosby.”

After that, she said her memory was a blur. She vaguely recalled watching a Japanese samurai movie, but not much else.
“I don't remember where the theater was nor very much of the evening,” she wrote. “What I do recall, vividly and clearly, is waking up the next morning nude in the bed of his friend's apartment and seeing Cosby wearing a white terrycloth bathrobe and acting as if there was nothing unusual.”
She said she was in disbelief after the incident, but didn't alert the authorities. “It never occurred to me to go to the police,” she wrote. “It was a different time and ‘date rape' was a concept that didn't exist.

Ladd thought she was the only who Cosby had assaulted, until other women started coming forward.
“I told my story to our attorney, who is also a good friend, because I was considering going public then, but eventually chose not to because the case was settled,” she wrote. “This is the first time I have chosen to speak out about that night. It is also the last time I intend to address it publicly.
“I have no plans to sue, I don't want or need money. I have no plans for a press conference or for doing any interviews,” she added.

Ladd said she has run into Cosby once since then. “In the years since that night I have crossed paths with Cosby only once, when my husband, a highly successful Oscar-winning film executive and producer, introduced me to him,” she wrote. “I was shaking, wondering if he would recognize me by my unusual first name. His reaction spoke volumes. To Bill Cosby, I was just another stranger.”
Ladd joins a growing list of women who have accused Cosby of similar crimes, including former supermodels Beverly Johnson and Janice Dickinson.
As a result of the allegations, Cosby's comedy project with NBC was killed and Netflix pulled a stand-up special it had planned to premiere on Thanksgiving. Additionally, dozens of performances on his current stand-up tour have been canceled. Several of his stand-up performances went ahead as scheduled, however, causing outraged ticket holders who couldn't get refunds to protest the event.

In a statement previously issued to TheWrap, Cosby attorney Martin Singer denounced the star's accusers: “The new, never-before-heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated, fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30, 40, or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity.”

The gate of Fort Sam is still visible in Google Maps' Street View as it is on a public road
Enlarge Image
Close-up, ground-level imagery of US military sites posed a "potential threat" to security, it said.
The move follows the discovery of images of the Fort Sam Houston army base in Texas on Google Maps.
A Google spokesman said that where the US military had expressed concerns, images had been removed.
Google has now been barred from filming and conducting detailed studies of bases, following the discovery of detailed, three-dimensional panoramas online - and in particular, views of the Texan base.
But images inside the base have been removed
"Images include 360-degree views of the covered area to include access control points, barriers, headquarters, facilities and community areas," said the defence department in a statement quoted by AFP news agency.
It said such detailed mapping could pose a threat.
Google spokesman Larry Yu said the decision by a Google team to enter the Texas base, which is in San Antonio, and undertake a detailed survey, had been "a mistake".
He told the BBC that it was "not our policy to request access to military installations, but in this instance the operator of the vehicle with the camera on top - which is how we go about capturing imagery for Street-View - requested permission to access a military installation, was given access, and after learning of the incident we quickly removed the imagery".
Individuals and governments
Military officials are currently looking into exactly what imagery is available - though it may not be able to order its removal if images are taken from public streets.
'SPY' IN THE SKY Mar 2008: Pentagon bans Google map-makers filming inside military bases Feb 2008: Heathrow expansion protesters use Google Earth (GE) to plan House of Commons rooftop demo Oct 2007: Al-Aqsa Martyrs' brigade reportedly using GE to plot rocket attacks on Israel July 2007: New Chinese Jin-class nuclear sub spotted in port by users of GE Feb 2007: India demands sensitive sites be blurred amid concern over extremists Aug 2006: Morrocco begins blocking access to GE, giving no reason Dec 2005: GE obscures view of Washington mansion of Vice-President Dick Cheney Aug 2005: South Korea voices "security concerns" at images of its military bases and presidential mansion
Among the popular mapping services offered by Google are Street View, which allows web users to "drive" along virtual US landscapes with ground-level views, and Google Earth, which offers detailed satellite and 3D images of locations around the world.
In this case, it was imagery offered on Street View that caused the concern.
But both have provoked complaints - from individuals depicted in the images and from governments concerned that satellite images could compromise security.
Gary Ross, a spokesman for the US Northern Command, told AFP that although such services could be useful, "there has to be a balance".
But Mr Yu said Google would listen to concerns about privacy and security.
"We try to have a compliant image removal policy - not only relative to the military but to consumers also," said Mr Yu.
"If people have concerns, they should contact us."
Allied Progress continued its efforts to take on U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz's, D-Fla., position on payday lenders this week, targeting her with billboards.
On Monday, Allied Progress announced it would run two billboards in Wasserman Schultz's district portraying her as “Debt Trap Debbie” and insisting she doesn't stand with President Barack Obama on the payday lenders.
“President Obama has shown he's on the side of hardworking Americans by encouraging the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to hold payday lenders accountable,” said Karl Frisch, the executive director of Allied Progress.“In a stunning contrast, Rep. Wasserman Schultz has accepted tens-of-thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from these predators – often within weeks of taking official actions to benefit the industry – and is now working with radical conservatives to help gut the CFPB's efforts to stop the worst abuses of these payday lenders.”
Allied Progress hit Wasserman Schultz for raising almost $70,000 from the payday loan industry. Still, even as Allied Progress looked to contrast Wasserman Schultz with Obama, he did endorse her last week.
"Debbie has been a strong, progressive leader in Congress and a hardworking, committed chair of our national party since I proudly nominated her to the role in 2011," Obama said. "She always stands up and fights for what is right for her district while passionately supporting middle class families.
"Throughout my time as president I have seen Debbie bring an unwavering commitment to her family, her constituents, and our shared goals of protecting seniors, supporting working families, and expanding economic opportunity for more people," Obama added.
Wasserman Schultz is facing a major Democratic primary challenger in attorney Tim Canova. On Monday, the Hill reported Canova brought in around $550,000 in the first quarter of 2016 for his bid.
"Our campaign has been met with incredible enthusiasm,” Canova said on Monday. “There is an intense desire in South Florida, as there is around the country, to end politics as usual and elect a representative who will put the people first, not big Wall Street banks and giant companies."
Wasserman Schultz also faces campaign finance reform advocate Doug Hughes in the Democratic primary. Both Canova and Hughes are hoping to tap into liberal discontent with Wasserman Schultz due to her role as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Several liberal groups have accused Wasserman Schultz of limiting the number of Democratic presidential debates to boost her old ally former U.S. Sec. of State Hillary Clinton and deny opportunities to U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

The Paul Ricard circuit is expected to return to F1 in the near future as the French Grand Prix is set for a revival.
Formula 1 races have been held on two different versions of the track before. The original 5.8km (3.6-mile) track used was until 1985 and after that a shortened 3.8km (2.4-mile) version held the French race until 1990.
The circuit has been extensively renovated since F1's last race there in 1990 and now boasts a staggering 167 different configurations, all of which can be seen in this document (PDF) on the circuit's website.
A race could be held on a different variation of the track every season until the year 2180 – so far into the dim and distant future it's possible Bernie Ecclestone may no longer be with us by then.
However some of these layouts are completely unsuitable for F1 – such as the sub-1km loops which don't include the pit straight. And it's much more likely F1 will pick a configuration and stick with it.
But which one? Here's a few of the more likely and interesting options.
1A – 5.752km
This track is the closest to the original Paul Ricard circuit currently available. It includes the high-speed Varrerie S-bend at the start of the lap and the flat-out Mistral straight leading into the famous Signes corner.
The race organisers are tipped to use one of the longer circuit configurations. Track director Stephane Clair told Autosport one of the longer tracks would be used, but it's not clear which one.
Using the longer version of the track without a chicane in the Mistral straight would encourage teams to use more low-downforce set-ups – something which is seen at very few F1 tracks these days.
1A-V2 – 5.791km
This is a very similar configuration to the first one, but with a slightly slower version of Varrerie.
The European Le Mans Series used this configuration for their race earlier this month.
1C-V2 – 5.842km
Though it would be spectacular to see F1 cars tackling the entry to Signes at over 200mph, some consideration is being given to using one of the chicanes to interrupt what would otherwise be a flat-out 1.1-mile blast.
This would be unfortunate as recent experience at Abu Dhabi has shown that placing chicanes in the middle of straights is not a good way to promote overtaking.
Daniel Ricciardo and Jean-Eric Vergne are familiar with this configuration – they raced on it in last year's Formula Renault 3.5 meeting.
3A – 3.793km
An alternative to using the chicane in the Mistral could be to return to the shorter track configuration which F1 used from 1986 to 1990.
With only nine corners (counting Beausset as two) this would be the simplest track on the F1 calendar – Monza currently has the lowest corner count with 11. At 3.793km (2.36 miles) it would be the second-shortest track on the calendar after Monaco.
We could expect an F1 race on the shorter track to have some of the qualities of the Brazilian round of the championship at Interlagos – a close grid thanks to the short lap length, and leaders kept busy lapping traffic.
It would also have the most laps of any race on the calendar today – 81 – which would be good news for spectators.
Version 2A is similar to this track but slightly longer at 4.087km (2.54 miles). I have suggested 3A as it is closest to the last version of the track F1 raced on.
Paul Ricard tracks compared
Potential distances of an F1 race on each track based on their lap lengths. F1 races must run to a minimum distance of 305km (189.5 miles). Monaco is an exception to this rule, running to a length of 260km.
Track Lap length (km) Race laps Race distance (km) Paul Ricard 1A 5.752 54 310.608 Paul Ricard 1A-V2 5.791 53 306.923 Paul Ricard 1C-V2 5.842 53 309.626 Paul Ricard 3A 3.793 81 307.233
I say
The likelihood Paul Ricard's return to the F1 calendar will come partly at the expense of Spa-Francorchamps is very disappointing.
But that shouldn't dampen our enthusiasm for seeing F1 cars return to a track they first raced at over 40 years ago.
The race organisers have indicated they would like to hold the race on the longer track. This only makes sense if they intend to use the full Mistral straight without the chicane.
Using the chicane would defeat the point of having the straight there and discourage teams from running their cars in low-downforce trim, which would distinguish the track from many of the other venues on the calendar today.
If it isn't possible to run the full-length track without the chicane, then they should use a shorter configuration such as 3A.
A race on a busy track with a high number of laps – with lap times potentially dipping under 60 seconds – would make for a worthwhile break from the norm. Which is something the increasing homogenous F1 calendar badly needs.
You say: Which circuit should they use at Paul Ricard?
Which of the options above do you think would work best for F1's return to Paul Ricard? Or should they use one of the 163 other variations of the Le Castellet track?

This was a spontaneous concept, but I ended up really enjoying it! Princess outfits re-imagined as nouveau style, designed as though intended to be made, so all feasibly possibly to construct (I think!) Mulan > Belle > ArielThese were so much fun to do and I think they'd make a great cosplay group! If I had more time (and money) and I would totally make them.Cinderella, Elsa and Rapunzel is next, if I have time before I go back to work!-----------------------------For those interested, here is intended construction details (you've gotta be good at ombre dyeing if you want to attempt this haha!):Mulan: Made from light cottons dyed in gradients. Cuffs, belt and shoulder pads inspired by Chinese armour designs, made from embossed leather and embroidered. Tokens on belt are metal coins. Beads are jade. I wanted to create a soft, feminine look while still retaining traces of the warrior beneath it all!Belle: Edging more into art deco, but still nouveau-esque imo. Top of dress would be either cotton or stiff silk, tail of dress is layers of chiffon. Again, all dyed in gradients. Bottom panels are sewn on top of an a-line skirt and fixed with embroidery. Bodice and upper skirt are paneled and embroidered - center piece is a sewn on belt, embroidered with dusky, earthy beads, though the very middle design is made of mirrored beads, to represent Beast's shattered mirror.Ariel: Thanks to everyone on Facebook and Tumblr for voting on colours! I still would have loved the pink but the teal was quite popularThe whole dress is a mix of her mermaid and human forms. Sleeves are fixed to bodice, puffed and slit to reveal cream lining. Tail of dress is layers of chiffon blended into the upper skirt by embroidery consisting of pearls, gold beads and lace. Bodice is boned with pearl trimming and embroidered same as the skirt, with the addition of sea-inspired adornments. The 'seashell bra' is pleated, stiffened fabric.---------------------------------
Ali Eskandarian, the dean of the College of Professional Studies, said several faculty members who already research topics related to Native Americans will use the Indigenous Peoples' Center. The center will start searching for a director next month.
The search for a director for the new AT&T Center for Indigenous Politics and Policy will begin next month, officials confirmed this week.
AT&T donated $450,000 last month to establish the CIPP after officials presented a funding proposal to the company. The center, housed in the College of Professional Studies, will be dedicated to research and education on Native populations. Officials said that AT&T will continue to fund the center for the next three years and other foundations will fund it later on.
Over the past decade, AT&T has contributed more than $7 million to support education for indigenous peoples. The donation to the University was in honor of Native American Heritage month in November.
Gregory Lebel, an assistant professor of political management and the director of the Native American Political Leadership Program, said in an email that the center will focus on issues Native communities face, the political realities surrounding those issues and political processes that can overcome such challenges.
“GW has established a strong record of commitment to diversity and these efforts to address issues facing indigenous peoples in the United States are part of that effort,” Lebel said. “The center provides the opportunity and means to marry this commitment with GW's unique position as an institution of higher learning with a strong vein of political expertise and influence.”
AT&T has collaborated with GW before: The tech conglomerate established the University's Native Ameri­can Political Leadership Program in 2006 and the INSPIRE Native Teens Pre-College Program in 2013. Both programs award full scholarships to Native American high school students to allow them to take classes at GW, learn about politics and have mentorship opportunities.
Both of the existing programs will eventually be run through CIPP, Lebel said.
Lebel said the new center will continue GW's role in supporting Native students on campus, addressing the politics and policy that surround the lives of indigenous people and will be a catalyst to increase the number of Native students at GW. And while the programming specifics will be at the discretion of the director, research and learning will be the center's overall goals.
Native American students make up the smallest ethnic population at the University, with only 10 enrolled undergraduate American Indian or Alaska Native, non-Hispanic students, according to Oct. 2015 data from the Office of Institutional Research.
“The very presence of CIPP at GW goes a long way toward giving recognition and voice to GW's Native student population,” Lebel said.
Ali Eskandarian, the dean of the College of Professional Studies, said in an email that while putting the grant proposal together, several faculty members who are researching related topics showed their interest and support for the center.
“It would be our intention to tap into the existing expertise within GW as the goals of the center are further elucidated,” Eskandarian said.
Jennifer Bertolet, a professional lecturer of history who focuses on Native American history and culture in her research, said she is enthusiastic about the center's potential to bring attention to Native American issues and to encourage students to do related research.
“I hope that the center will raise awareness, within the GW community and beyond, of the on-going policy struggles that Native Americans still face with respect to their treaty rights, water rights, land rights and natural resources,” Bertolet said.
Bertolet said that beyond raising awareness and working toward policy solutions, the center should also provide infrastructure and training for faculty who study topics related to indigenous populations.
“Many GW students express a strong interest in policy matters and this center can offer information and training in an area of policy that students might not have considered,” she said.
Brian Barlow, the president of the GW Native Student Leadership Council, said that he hopes the center can successfully educate the student body and general public about Native Americans' access to education and health care.
“Access to higher education is huge, mental and behavioral health, access to quality healthcare,” Barlow said. “As a center for policy, trying to establish true nation to nation relationships between tribes and the federal government is important.”
Barlow said the center could help present a more complete picture of Native American culture to a public that has unrealistic ideas of what it means to be Native American.
“Anything to help people learn a little bit more about tribal communities,” he said. “By and large, the American public is pretty ignorant to Indian country. Not in the media, nothing in pop culture, really – except for what's appropriated. Most things that are ‘Native' are pretty far from realistic.”

Richard Sherman doesn't believe that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell would stand up to an owner the way his NBA counterpart, Adam Silver, did when he banned Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling for life for making racist comments.
Asked in an interview with Time Magazine whether he thought Goodell would take the same stance as Silver, who has been widely praised for his decision to rid the NBA of Sterling, Sherman said, "No, I don't."
Sherman, who signed a $57.4 million contract extension Wednesday with the Seattle Seahawks that makes him the league's highest-paid cornerback, expanded on his comments by saying the league already dropped the ball on racial sensitivity with the way it's handled the debate about the Washington Redskins' name.
"Because we have an NFL team called the Redskins," Sherman said, "I don't think the NFL really is as concerned as they show. The NFL is more of a bottom-line league. If it doesn't affect their bottom line, they're not as concerned."
Sherman also said he was not surprised by Sterling's disparaging remarks about blacks and pointed to the criticism he endured following his nationally televised rant after Seattle beat the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC title game.
"I wasn't really shocked or anything because of what I saw after the incident after the NFC Championship Game," Sherman said. "You've got a lot of racial backlash, and a lot of racist comments that were uncalled for -- I can never see a time where racism is called for. So it didn't shock me as much as it would have had I not experienced that personally, had I not seen those things.
"It showed me that America still had some progress to make. On equality, and understanding that it doesn't matter what color you are, you treat people as people. And whether a good person or a bad person, you don't judge them off the color of their skin. You can know a person is a good person or a bad person by who they are, not by what they look like. In that situation, it just seems like a lot of people gave [Sterling] a lot of flak, well deserved, but you know -- I feel like a lot more people were surprised than they should have been.
"That's why a lot of people shy away from the conversation that I forced on us in January," Sherman said. "People want to it to be done, they want that uncomfortable truth to be over with, they want the racism to be done, they want to believe everything is great and hunky-dory. And it's not. There's a lot of racism still alive and still active. And it just forced America to rethink it once again, and to really, really understand that racism isn't gone. We have to actively push it out. And snuff it out."
Arthur T. Demoulas, the ousted chief executive of the Demoulas Market Basket chain, made an offer Wednesday to buy out the shareholders of the company aligned with his cousin, Arthur S. Demoulas. How the ownership structure of the chain breaks down:
The grocery chain had its origin in a neighborhood food store in Lowell that was opened in 1917 by Greek immigrants Arthur and his wife Efrasine Demoulas.
In 1954, the couple sells the business to two of their six children, George and Telemachus.
George Demoulas died suddenly on June 27, 1971, while vacationing with his family in Greece.

The family feud over control of the company burst onto the public scene in 1990, when Arthur S. Demoulas, a son of George, filed a complaint that Telemachus Demoulas was diverting assets from the chain into businesses solely owned by his branch of the family. After one of the longest, costliest, and nastiest court battles in the state's legal history, Telemachus Demoulas was eventually forced to pay George's relatives $206 million. The judge awarded 50.5% of the shares, a controlling interest, to George's heirs.

OTTAWA — Health Canada has quietly deleted from its website all references to a planned framework for rare-disease drugs that dates back to 2012 and was intended to improve the availability of such drugs in Canada.
Canada is one of the only developed countries without a regulatory framework for rare-disease drugs, also known as orphan drugs.
Durhane Wong-Rieger, president and CEO of the Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders, said the decision “certainly seems to be the kiss of death” for the orphan drug framework.
“I am totally, totally devastated that they have taken such a big move to totally eliminate it,” she said.
Until Oct. 6, a Health Canada webpage claimed the department was “developing an orphan drug regulatory framework that seeks to encourage the development of orphan drugs and increase the availability of these products on the Canadian market.” It also promised consultations that were “expected to take place before the end of 2017.” The webpage has since been removed.
Orphan drug regulations had been listed as one of the proposals that Health Canada expected to bring forward between 2017 and 2019, but the initiative has now disappeared from the department's regulatory plan.
Conservative MP Tom Kmiec, whose three children have a rare disease called Alport syndrome, said the change is “surprising.”
“Obviously it's not a priority if it's not in Health Canada's forward regulatory plan,” he said.
I am totally, totally devastated that they have taken such a big move
Canada's orphan drug framework was first announced by the Harper government in 2012, but has sat on the back burner for several years since then. Elsewhere, such frameworks provide incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs for small numbers of patients suffering from rare diseases, which are defined in Europe as those affecting fewer than one in 2,000 people. Incentives can include tax credits for clinical trial expenses, research grants, expedited approvals and waived approval fees, and market exclusivity for a number of years.
Without a framework in Canada, Wong-Rieger said, pharmaceutical companies may not bother to apply for marketing approval for their orphan drugs in this country. “Companies don't know to come and they don't know to come early and they don't know to do clinical trials here,” she said.
Wong-Rieger said she was “quite dismayed” to learn that Health Canada has pulled orphan drugs from its regulatory plan. “Now it seems that without even letting us know, they've decided basically to discontinue it.”
Health Canada says it has launched a new regulatory review of drugs and devices focused on improving access to drugs. “Many elements initially proposed as part of an orphan drug regulatory framework are now being considered more broadly for all drugs as part of this initiative,” a spokesperson told the Post by email.
But the department offered no timeline for that new review, Kmiec pointed out. “That worries me, because patients don't have time for that.” He believes much of the previous government's work on the issue has been “undone.”
Wong-Rieger said it's not enough to treat orphan drugs the same as other pharmaceuticals, when other countries provide incentives for their development. “The problem is that the rest of the world does not get the message that we actually are trying to approve those drugs,” she said.
Internationally, the production of orphan drugs has ballooned in recent years, due in part to orphan drug policies. In the U.S., more than 500 orphan drugs have been approved for marketing since the passage of the Orphan Drug Act in 1983, compared to fewer than 10 in the preceding decade.
But fewer of the drugs have been approved in Canada. A document tabled recently in the House of Commons in answer to a question from Kmiec shows that Health Canada granted marketing approval to 85 orphan drugs between May 2013 and June 2017. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration approved between 30 and 45 orphan drugs each year between 2013 and 2016.
In some cases, Canadian patients can access orphan drugs not approved in Canada through Health Canada's Special Access Programme, but may have to pay for them out-of-pocket. Because they target small populations, orphan drugs are often hugely expensive.
Still, Matthew Herder, director of the Health Law Institute at Dalhousie University, said the change in plans for an orphan drug framework is “a nice example of Health Canada maybe paying attention to the evidence.”
He believes it's “far from clear” that existing policies in other countries actually work as they're supposed to. Many of the orphan drugs that are approved are for rare cancers, he said, because pharmaceutical companies know that physicians will often prescribe those medications for cancers other than the ones they've targeted, meaning they can be very profitable.
“So the vast majority of rare diseases still don't have drugs available,” he said. “If the purpose of an orphan drug law is really to encourage research into diseases that the market is neglecting, I'm not sure we're doing that.”
Drug companies can also target rare types of more common diseases and take advantage of orphan drug incentives, all the while knowing their drugs can actually be used to treat the more common disease, he said — a practice known as “salami-slicing.”
“They're using that knowledge to game the regulatory structure,” he explained.
Herder's research has shown that nearly 75 per cent of orphan drugs approved for marketing in the U.S. had also been approved in Canada in 2012, though it does take longer for new drugs to be approved here.
He said Canada could use an orphan drug policy, but added that it should look “nothing like” those in the U.S. or Europe.

Canadian police have arrested 10 young people for allegedly attempting to join jihadist groups in the Middle East, reports said.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said in a statement, cited by The Canadian Press on Wednesday, that no charges had been laid yet and that the investigation was ongoing.
The RCMP statement did not specifically mention which group they were joining, but said the 10 youths were "suspected of wanting to leave the country to join jihadist groups".
The youths, whose names and ages were not reported by the police, were arrested at Montreal's Trudeau International Airport last Friday, the report said.
"These are very difficult times for the relatives and loved ones of the persons arrested," the RCMP said in the statement.
"As a result, family members often find themselves at a complete loss and unable to understand the decision made by the youth."
The arrests come months after five boys and two girls from the Montreal area left the country and apparently joined the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL).
Another Canadian teen was arrested in March for aiming to join the armed group that holds sway over vast area of Syria and neighbouring Iraq.
.- A leaked e-mail shows that the Democratic-leaning organization Faith in Public Life is running a behind-the-scenes media effort to undercut the U.S. bishops and the “Fortnight for Freedom” events intended to rally opposition to the HHS mandate.
Bill Donohue, President of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, released the e-mail detailing the campaign on June 18. He said a copy of the e-mail had been leaked to him.
Donohue said “fair minded persons” may disagree with the religious freedom effort “but there is something unseemly going on when those who work for a George Soros-funded group are quietly providing talking points to the media.”
The June 7 e-mail from John Gehring, Faith in Public Life's Catholic Program Director, is addressed to reporters, editors and columnists. It describes itself as a “backgrounder” and contains talking points, adversarial questions for Catholic bishops and recommendations of experts to interview.
It appears aimed at shaping a narrative skeptical towards Catholic objections to a Department of Health and Human Services mandate that requires employers, including many Catholic institutions, to provide insurance coverage for sterilization and contraception, including some abortion-causing drugs.
“Are you willing to sacrifice Catholic charities, colleges and hospitals if you don't get your way on the contraceptive mandate?” reads one proposed question for a bishop.
“Are you willing to drop all health insurance for your employees?” reads another.
The e-mail encouraged journalists to “ask critical questions” about the bishops' “sweeping claims” in light of a “charged political backdrop” ahead of the 2012 election. It noted that both the June 8 “Stand Up for Religious Freedom” rallies and the June 21-July 4 “Fortnight for Freedom” campaign include Catholic dioceses.
CNA sought comment multiple times from Gehring and Faith in Public Life but did not receive a response.
On its website, Faith in Public Life describes itself as “a strategy center for the faith community advancing faith in the public square as a powerful force for justice, compassion and the common good.” It runs strategic communications and “narrative-setting” campaigns. The organization says it can identify “moments of opportunity when a targeted event or campaign can effectively broaden or shift the values debate.”
It works to insert its perspective into political debates and to highlight “progressive and moderate people of faith at key moments.”
Gehring's June 7 e-mail focused only on contraception and “birth control.” It did not mention coverage of sterilization or contraceptive drugs that may cause abortion.
He wrote that several Catholic bishops have used “inflammatory and irresponsible rhetoric” that conflates “working through complex policy issues with a fundamental attack on the Catholic Church.”
The leaked e-mail also suggested that reporters should reject as “fiction” any claim that there is a “war on religion” and a “war on the Catholic Church.”
It classified as “fiction” U.S. bishops' conference president Cardinal Timothy Dolan's statement that the administration is “strangling” the Catholic Church. Gehring also suggested news media ask whether bishops should be concerned about the religious freedom campaign “becoming politicized in an election year.”
Over 40 Catholic institutions have filed lawsuits challenging the mandate, while Catholics and other faith leaders have organized religious freedom rallies around the country, including the upcoming “Fortnight for Freedom.”
Gehring encouraged reporters, columnists and journalists to ask who is funding the religious freedom effort.
“Reporters should consider asking about the Knights of Columbus, an organization with deep pockets,” the e-mail advised. Gehring tried to paint Supreme Knight of Columbus Carl Anderson as a political partisan, noting his work in the Reagan administration and his time as a legislative assistant to Republican Sen. Jesse Helms in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Faith in Public Life's recommended sources for interviews, as listed in Gehring's e-mail, are John Gehring, Duquesne University law professor Nicholas Cafardi, Fordham University theology department chair Terrence W. Tilley, Boston College theology professor Lisa Sowle Cahill, Note Dame Law School professor M. Cathleen Kaveny, Fairfield University religious studies professor Paul Lakeland, and Fr. Thomas Reese, S.J. of the Woodstock Theological Center.
The Catholic League's Bill Donohue was critical of the media effort, saying Gehring's e-mail encouraged the media to “victimize the victim” and target those who refuse to compromise their principles.

The popularity of the short-term accommodation rental website Airbnb is skyrocketing in Vancouver – and recent research shows it may be negatively impacting an already tight rental market.
Airbnb is the ideal option for many travelers around the world, especially those who balk at paying pricey hotel costs. And it's a growing trend: Simon Fraser urban studies graduate student Karen Sawatzky says there's been a 63 per cent jump year-over-year on Airbnb rentals in Vancouver – and not just during the busy tourist season.
"The number of Airbnb listings seems to be growing continually, even in the off-season,” Sawatsky says, noting that in the last six months alone 1,000 more listings have been posted on the site, bringing the total to more than 4,700.
This means that many properties that could be rented out to locals for longer periods of time are no longer available, with some owners preferring to rent the accommodation out short-term.
"Any number of units that...could be rented out for long-term and are instead being rented out for short-term is going to have some kind of effect on the people on the ground who are looking for units,” she says. “And cost is related to supply.”
The vacancy rate for rental properties in Vancouver is currently below one percent, Sawatzky says, while a healthy vacancy rate should be around three per cent.
Landlord BC agrees, noting there are other huge issues with Airbnb. It's not only illegal without a special permit, but it can possibly contravene the residential tenancy act – and there are safety concerns.
"Obviously we don't want to see a whole bunch of strangers on a regular basis,” says CEO David Hutniak. “We want to really manage that part of it."
The City of Vancouver is currently studying the impact of Airbnb to see if more stringent regulation may be needed in the future.

Michigan officials declared in late November that Trump won the state's count by 10,704 votes. But hold on — a record 75,355 ballots were not counted.
The uncounted ballots came mostly from Detroit and Flint, majority-Black cities that vote Democratic.
According to the machines that read their ballots, these voters waited in line, sometimes for hours, yet did not choose a president. Really?
This week, I drove through a snowstorm to Lansing to hear the official explanation from Ruth Johnson, the Republican secretary of state. I was directed to official flack-catcher Fred Woodhams who told me, “You know, I think when you look at the unfavorability ratings that were reported for both major-party candidates, it's probably not that surprising.”
Sleuthing about in Detroit, I found another explanation: bubbles.
Bubbles?
Michigan votes on paper ballots. If you don't fill the bubble completely, the machine records that you didn't vote for president.

Susan, a systems analyst who took part in the hand recount initiated by Jill Stein, told me, “I saw a lot of red ink. I saw a lot of checkmarks. We saw a lot of ballots that weren't originally counted, because those don't scan into the machine.” (I can only use her first name because she's terrified of retribution from Trump followers in the white suburb where she lives.)
Other ballots were not counted because the machines thought the voter chose two presidential candidates.
How come more ballots were uncounted in Detroit and Flint than in the white ‘burbs and rural counties? Are the machines themselves racist?
No, but they are old, and in some cases, busted. An astonishing 87 machines broke down in Detroit, responsible for counting tens of thousands of ballots. Many more were simply faulty and uncalibrated.
I met with Carlos Garcia, University of Michigan multimedia specialist, who, on Election Day, joined a crowd waiting over two hours for the busted machine to be fixed.
Some voters left; others filled out ballots that were chucked, uncounted, into the bottom of machine. When the machine was fixed, Carlos explained, “Any new scanned ballots were falling in on top of the old ones.” It would not be possible to recount those dumped ballots.
This is not an unheard of phenomenon: I know two voters who lost their vote in another state (California) because they didn't fill in the bubble — my parents! Meet mom and dad in my film, The Best Democracy Money Can Buy:
How did Detroit end up with the crap machines?
Detroit is bankrupt, so every expenditure must be approved by “emergency” overlords appointed by the Republican governor. The GOP operatives refused the city's pre-election pleas to fix and replace the busted machines.
“We had the rollout [of new machines] in our budget,” Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey said. “No money was appropriated by the state.”
Same in Flint. GOP state officials cut the budget for water service there, resulting in the contamination of the city's water supply with lead. The budget cuts also poisoned the presidential race.
The Human Eye Count
There is, however, an extraordinary machine that can read the ballots, whether the bubbles are filled or checked, whether in black ink or red, to determine the voters' intent: the human eye.
That's why Dr. Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, paid millions of dollars for a human eyeball count of the uncounted votes. While labeled a “recount,” its real purpose is to count the 75,355 votes never counted in the first place.
Count those ballots, mostly in Detroit and Flint, and Trump's victory could vanish.
Adding to the pile of uncounted ballots are the large numbers of invalidated straight-ticket votes in Detroit. In Michigan, you can choose to make one mark that casts your vote for every Democrat (or Republican) for every office. Voters know that they can vote the Democratic ballot but write in a protest name — popular were “Bernie Sanders” and “Mickey Mouse” — but their ballot, they knew, would count for Clinton.
However, the Detroit machines simply invalidated the ballots with protest write-ins because the old Opti-Scans wrongly tallied these as “over-votes” (i.e., voting for two candidates). The human eye would catch this mistake.
But Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette stymied Stein's human eye count. The Republican pol issued an order saying that no one could look at the ballots cast in precincts where the number of votes and voters did not match — exactly the places where you'd want to look for the missing votes. He also ordered a ban on counting ballots from precincts where the seals on the machines had been broken — in other words, where there is evidence of tampering. Again, those are the machines that most need investigating. The result: The recount crews were denied access to more than half of all Detroit precincts (59 percent).
I met with Stein, who told me she was stunned by this overt sabotage of the recount. “It's shocking to think that the discounting of these votes may be making the critical difference in the outcome of the election,” she said.
This story was repeated in Wisconsin, which uses the same Opti-Scan system as Michigan. There, the uncounted votes, sometimes called “spoiled” or “invalidated” ballots, were concentrated in Black-majority Milwaukee. Stein put up over $3 million of donated funds for the human eye review in Wisconsin, but GOP state officials authorized Milwaukee County to recount simply by running the ballots through the same blind machines. Not surprisingly, this instant replay produced the same questionable result.
Adding Un-Votes to the Uncounted
Stein was also disturbed by the number of voters who never got to cast ballots. “Whether it's because of the chaos [because] some polling centers are closed, and then some are moved, and there are all kinds of mix-ups,” she said. “So, a lot of people are filling out provisional ballots, or they were being tossed off the voter rolls by Interstate Crosscheck.”
Interstate Crosscheck is a list that was created by Donald Trump supporter and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach to hunt down and imprison voters who illegally voted or registered in two states in one election.
An eye-popping 499,092 Michiganders are on the Crosscheck suspect list. The list, which my team uncovered in an investigation for Rolling Stone, cost approximately 50,000 of the state's voters their registrations. Disproportionately, the purged voters were Blacks, Latinos and that other solid Democratic demographic, Muslim Americans. (Dearborn, Michigan, has the highest concentration of Arab Americans in the US.)
The Michigan Secretary of State's spokesman Woodhams told me the purpose of the mass purge was, “to clean our voter lists and ensure that there's no vulnerability for fraud. We've been very aggressive in closing vulnerabilities and loopholes to fraud.”
While Woodhams did not know of a single conviction for double-voting in Michigan, the “aggression” in purging the lists was clear. I showed him part of the Michigan purge list that he thought was confidential. The “double voters” are found by simply matching first and last names. Michael Bernard Brown is supposed to be the same voter as Michael Anthony Brown. Michael Timothy Brown is supposed to be the same voter as Michael Johnnie Brown.
Woodhams assured me the GOP used the Trump-Kobach list with care, more or less. He said, “I'm sure that there are some false positives. But we go through it thoroughly, and we're not just canceling people.”
As to the racial profiling inherent in the list? Did he agree with our experts that by tagging thousands of voters named Jose Garcia and Michael Brown there would be a bias in his purge list?
The GOP spokesman replied, “I've known a lot of white Browns.”
Jill Stein didn't buy it. Responding to both Michigan's and Trump's claim that voter rolls are loaded with fraudulent double voters, Stein said, “It's the opposite of what he is saying: not people who are voting fraudulently and illegally, but actually legitimate voters who have had their right to vote taken away from them by Kris Kobach and by Donald Trump.”
Crosscheck likely cost tens of thousands their vote in Pennsylvania as well.
“It is a Jim Crow system, and it all needs to be fixed,” Stein concluded. “It's not rocket science. This is just plain, basic democracy.”
Almost no one in the Houston Astros organization is making big league money. The highest-paid player is pitcher Erik Bedard, who is playing on a one-year, $1.15 million contract. No one else is pulling in over $1 million a year. That is, no one besides Jim Crane, who owns the worst team in the majors and is quietly making more money than any baseball owner in history.
The Astros are on pace to rake in an estimated $99 million in operating income (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) this season. That is nearly as much as the estimated operating income of the previous six World Series championship teams — combined.
Yet the Astros are 43-86, worst in the majors. Of the 270 Major League Baseball teams who have taken the field since 2005, none have finished with a worse winning percentage than Houston's.
They have become so profitable thanks to slashed payroll expenses and soaring television revenues.
Since becoming the Astros' owner in 2011, Crane has gutted the team of its most expensive players while building up the farm system. Over the course of this season, the team will pay its players an estimated $21 million in salary and bonuses. That is down $56 million from 2011, when Crane bought the team.
The Astros opened this season with a league-low $26 million active payroll and have since cut it to under $13 million, according to the Houston Chronicle. Houston traded or released four of its five players making over $1 million.
The Astros did not respond to repeated requests to discuss the team's finances and rebuilding strategy.
But Crane told ESPN The Magazine, "Once our minor league system is filled in, we'll move up into the top five or 10 in payroll."
Other teams have said the same thing, only to keep payroll low year after year. But the Astros might actually mean it. Crane doesn't appear to be gouging fans for profit. Since becoming the owner, he has introduced fan-friendly policies like allowing food and drinks into the ballpark.
But he will likely use some of the cash flow to pay down the reported $275 million debt he took on when buying the team. He financed the purchase with a $220 million loan from Bank of America and assumed $55 million of debt from a previous loan with Major League Baseball, according to the Sports Business Journal.
If the Astros were to use their current gains to pay for future players, $99 million could make a huge difference. The Astros could have taken on the contracts of the entire starting lineup for the National League all-star team this year for just $84 million.
Sixty-four major leaguers make more individually than the Astros' current 25-man active payroll makes collectively. The New York Yankees pay nine players more than the Astros payroll. Twenty other teams pay at least one player more. And Jason Bay, who is not even on a team, earns more than the all of the Astros, thanks to an old contract with the New York Mets.
Crane has dropped payroll despite raking in revenue from one of the biggest television deals in all baseball.
The regional sports network Comcast SportsNet Houston pays the Astros an average of $80 million a year to show their games — about $50 million more than the Astros got under their previous deal.
The massive boost in revenue means that the Astros have plenty of spare money. They could pay for their current payroll six times over with money from their local television deal alone. And they bring in nearly $40 million from other television and radio deals.
In an age when DVR and Netflix allow people to watch TV without commercials, live sports remain one of the few types of programming that advertisers consider DVR-proof. No one wants to miss a play, and everyone has to see it live — and is therefore stuck with the commercials too. Just 19% of television households owned DVR in 2008, but 44% do today, according to Nielsen. Sports programming has never been so valuable.
Owners like Crane are getting in on the action.
The Astros own 45% of CSN Houston, the Rockets own 33%, and NBC Universal owns the rest. It is becoming increasingly common for sports teams to take equity stakes in the networks who buy their rights.
“Sports rights are escalating astronomically, so ideally, on a team you want to be benefiting from anybody who is in there trying to take a piece of margin out of it,” said Derek Baine, an analyst at SNL Kagan who covers sports media. “It's a way you can generate big fees while still capturing some of the upside if they ever get sold. Because when they get sold, they go for pretty big valuation also.”
But CSN Houston has run into problems. Since launching last fall, the network has had trouble signing deals with local satellite and cable providers who do not want to pay their pricey rate per subscriber — $3.03, 38 cents above the average for regional sports networks, according to SNL Kagan. CSN Houston is shown in just 40% of the TV households in Houston, according to the Houston Chronicle. As a result, the network lost $63 million last year, according to SNL Kagan, which analyzes the business of television.
As the largest stakeholder in CSN Houston, the Astros absorbed the brunt of those losses. FORBES considers regional sports networks separate businesses and does not include their losses or gains in its operating income estimations. But even if the Astros' roughly $23 million loss were included, they would still have an estimated operating income of $71 million, higher than any team in history.
From Crane's perspective, it does not much matter whether the revenue is coming from the Astros proper or from the regional sports network partially owned by the Astros. And fortunately for Crane, CSN Houston should make more money as basketball season nears. With Dwight Howard in town, ratings for Rockets games will likely soar. TV providers may be more likely to sign on with CSN Houston once Rockets games start. If that happens, both the Rockets and the Astros will cash in.
As teams take stakes in regional sports networks, owners now have a new formula for making teams profitable. No longer can they rake in huge gains by filling stadiums with as many people as possible and keeping player payrolls low — regardless of wins and losses. Now on-field performance, and the buzz it creates in town, make TV ratings soar or plummet — and owners' profits go with them.
“That's the bottom line here is that the operators who haven't carried CSN Houston yet think it's overpriced given how the teams are performing,” Baine said. “If they did better, then they would probably be more likely to be picked up by DirecTV and others, so that would definitely help.”
That is good news for Astros fans. Although Crane is making money off of the old formula now, he could make even more if he ups payroll and fields a team good enough to draw fans back to the ballpark — and more importantly, back to their television sets.

Modifying the DNA of embryos is a "line that should not be crossed", a leading figure in US research says.
Dr Francis Collins, National Institutes of Health director, was responding to reports that the first embryos had been modified in China.
He argued there were "serious and unquantifiable safety issues", big ethical questions and no compelling medical reason to do it.
He said the NIH would not fund such research in the US.
The advent of "Crispr technology" - which is a more precise way of editing DNA than anything that has come before - has spurred huge progress in genetics.
But there had been growing concern these tremendous advances were making the modification of human embryos more likely.
Dr Tony Perry, a pioneer in cloning, told the BBC News website in January that designer babies were no longer "HG Wells" territory.
Concerns were also raised in the journal Nature as rumours circulated that it had already taken place.

Last week a team at Sun Yat-sen University, in Guangzhou, reported using Crispr to modify defective parts of DNA that lead to a blood disorder called beta thalassaemia.
Their world first, reported in the journal Protein and Cell, showed the correction was successful in seven out of 86 attempts.
However, there were a number of other "off-target" mutations introduced to the genetic code.

The embryos used were "non-viable" so could never have led to a child.
There have been repeated calls for a worldwide freeze on such research while society as a whole decides what should be allowed.
However, the US National Institutes of Health has made its position clear - that no such research should take place.
Dr Collins, who was also a key player in the Human Genome Project, released a statement saying: "The concept of altering the human germline in embryos for clinical purposes has been debated over many years from many different perspectives, and has been viewed almost universally as a line that should not be crossed.
"Advances in technology have given us an elegant new way of carrying out genome editing, but the strong arguments against engaging in this activity remain.
"These include the serious and unquantifiable safety issues, ethical issues presented by altering the germline in a way that affects the next generation without their consent, and a current lack of compelling medical applications."
Dr Marcy Darnovsky, from the Center for Genetics and Society in the US, argued: "There is no persuasive medical reason to manipulate the human germline because inherited genetic diseases can be prevented using embryo screening techniques, among other means.
"Is the only justification for trying to refine germline gene editing the prospect of so-called enhancement?"
MT. PLEASANT, Mich.–The Isabella Sheriff's Department confirmed Thursday morning the name of the suspect who abducted a West Michigan girl on the campus of Central Michigan University.
The sheriff's department said the suspect is 30-year-old Eric Ramsey of Mt. Pleasant. On Ramsey's Facebook page, he wrote early Thursday morning, “Well folks im about to get shot. Peace.”
The woman, whose identity was not released, was taken around 9:30 p.m. and forced into her own SUV. The pair left the campus and went to a home where the abductor bound and sexually assaulted the woman. He then took her to a barn where he got some gas cans.
After getting in the victim's car and driving, the abductor told the woman he was going to kill her. At that point, she jumped from the moving car and ran to a house for help. The people in the house let her in and locked the door, and the woman called 911. The suspect followed her, used gasoline to set the house on fire, and fled. One of the homeowners was able to put out the fire.
A description of the vehicle the suspect was driving was sent out to law enforcement agencies, and he was spotted in Otsego and Crawford counties, and several hours later the suspect rammed a state trooper's unit. He then stole a small sanitation truck and hit a Crawford County deputy's cruiser head on. The deputy got out of his unit, ran up to the suspect and fired. The suspect was killed.
One trooper was hurt in the series of incidents. There was no word on how badly.
In a news conference, police called the victim a hero. She may have suffered a broken arm when she jumped from the car.
Records kept by gardaí as they cancelled penalty points were so poor and unreliable it would be impossible to discipline or prosecute them, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (Gsoc) has found.
And for that reason, and because of the costs involved, Gsoc has decided to end its four-year inquiry.
It means no Garda members will be disciplined or prosecuted.
“Due to the passage of time, there is very little likelihood of securing criminal or disciplinary proceedings against garda members,” Gsoc said in a statement after the publication of a report of its investigation into qushing of penalty points.
“And in many cases, the Garda Síochána has already made disciplinary decisions that would negate any further action by Gsoc.”
It added the lowest quote it had received for follow-up investigations against individual gardaí was €1 million, though that could increase by a large amount.
Gsoc said the Garda's systems had been overhauled and the scope for abuses reduced because only three Garda members now had the power to cancel points.
And if any serving Garda members wanted points on their licences cancelled, they must now apply to the DPP.
However, Gsoc said it was doubtful whether those changes would ever have come about but for whistleblower Sgt Maurice McCabe exposing the abuses.
It said its staff met Sgt McCabe five times and got an insight into the nature of his information.
“Sgt McCabe went into specific detail relating to a number of cancellations where he believed wrongdoing had occurred, providing details, names of Garda members involved and the situation set out in each cancellation,” Gsoc said.
“Additionally, he mentioned what he classed as ‘habitual terminators' and where commercial vehicles or Garda members or their friends or family members had FCNs [fixed charge notices] cancelled.”
One Garda fined
Overall, penalty points were cancelled 76,600 times between 2009 and 2012 and 442 Garda members had the power to terminate the points.
However, Gsoc has been unable to determine how many fixed charge notices were cancelled without good reason. And it was unable to determine how many gardaí acted improperly.
In one case, a Dublin-based member terminated points 744 points incurred across 17 counties. He was disciplined with a fine of €3,000.
Rates at which points were cancelled across the State were almost uniform; at three or four per cent of all cases.
Only one county was outside that rate; Westmeath, with five per cent of cases cancelled.
Nationally, some 4.6 per cent of penalty points incurred were cancelled.
Sick dog
Gsoc issued its report marking the conclusion of its inquiries into the penalty points debacle. It contained some embarrassing findings for the Garda. These included:
A Garda member had points cancelled “on compassionate grounds associated with animal welfare”. It was later found he was bringing his sick dog to the vet.
One driver travelling at between 221km and 240km per hour had his speeding points terminated.
A journalist driving at 173km in a 120km zone was cautioned.
When the same journalist was detected driving at 152km per hour in a 120km zone the points were cancelled on the grounds they had become distracted by news of a relative's medical emergency.
Wife of a senior Garda had points cancelled on grounds she was using dictaphone rather than talking into a phone.
In 72 per cent of all cancellations the reason inserted onto the computer system was stated as “cancellation”.
When Garda members had speeding points cancelled, no checks were carried out to verify they were on duty and speeding because of a work-related task.
Members of national units, including those targeting organised crime, were cancelling points even though road traffic enforcement formed no part of their duties.
Some Garda members cancelled points so quickly after an offence the points were terminated before the offenders' received the official notices in the mail.
In those cases, one garda cancelled notices 48 times in three months. Another made 29 cancellations in two months.
The Pulse log-ins of retired senior garda officers were still active and being used by still serving members to cancel points. In some cases the log-ins were for officers retired more than a decade.
Written reminder
Aside from the one member fined €3,000, the only other sanction taken involved 50 members of up to the rank of superintendent being written to and reminded to stay within the rules in future.
Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan noted Gsoc's view that the record keeping was so poor, and the costs involved so high, that investigations into individual Garda members will not take place.
He said the acting Garda Commissioner Dónall Ó Cualáin had set out the same reasons in explaining why individual gardaí would not be pursued for fabricating breath test data.
“Clearly bearing in mind Gsoc's statutory independence, the decision on whether the investigation should be discontinued is one that only Gsoc can make,” Mr Flanagan said of the ending of the inquiry into penalty points being cancelled.
“A more robust system of supervision and continuous improvement would better serve to instil public confidence, as the report indicates.”
He believed significant reforms for the processing and oversight of the cancellation of points was now in place, with a judge also carrying out reviews and audits of points cancelled.

It has told the Low Pay Commission, which sets the minimum wage, that it must formally consider its impact on “employment and the economy”, before agreeing future increases.
The change, which will be written into the Commission's new terms of reference, raises the prospect of the first ever across-the-board freeze or cut in the minimum wage for everyone if the economic uncertainty continues.
The national minimum wage is established in law and is traditionally announced in March every year by the Commission, after negotiations with employers, unions and the Government.
The rate increased from £6.08 to £6.19 for those aged over 21 last October, but the hourly rate employees aged 18 to 20 were frozen at £4.98.
A three-yearly review of the Commission disclosed that the Department for Business has been frustrated that not enough attention has been paid by the Commission to successive rises in the minimum wage on the economy.
The review was carried out by Department for Business which annually sets out what ministers want the Commission to consider when setting the annual minimum wage.
Previously, Commission has been in the past asked by ministers “to take account” of the impact on the wider economy. But the review uncovered evidence of “tension” between the department and the Commission over “strict adherence to the annual remit”.
It found that “the Government-endorsed goal to have ‘a minimum wage that helps as many low-paid workers as possible without any significant adverse impact on employment or the economy', was not included explicitly in either the Act or remit”.
It said therefore that the Commission's new terms should include “the understood and accepted goal to raise the wages of the lowest paid without damaging employment or the economy”.
Ministers have repeatedly warned that the minimum wage was starting to have a “small adverse” impact on employment opportunities.
Employment minister Jo Swinson said in February: “The level of employment is now above its pre-recession peak, but the employment rate is below the pre-recession peak.
“This means that we believe that caution is required - particularly as the minimum wage rate is now at its highest ever level relative to average earnings for adults, and remains high for young people.”
Convenience stores have warned about the damaging effect of recent increases in the minimum wage. Research found that eight out of 10 small shops have had to lay off staff in the past year because of rising costs.
A similar proportion, according to the research by the Association of Convenience Stores, said the minimum wage should be frozen at its current level.
Last year a survey from off licences urged the Commission to freeze the minimum wage because they were struggling to cope with rising staff costs.
Last October, the Government hinted at the change when ministers said the case for a rise in the national minimum wage next year needed to be treated with “caution”, because of the “difficult” economic conditions.
Matthew Hancock, the business minister, said there is “evidence that in these tough economic times the minimum wage level may have an impact on the employment opportunities” of young people.
The news will alarm anti-poverty campaigners who have been urging the Government to adopt the higher “living wage”, which is estimated to be £7.45 this year.
Labour leader Ed Miliband is reported to be considering making the living wage, which is also set annually by campaigners, a key part of Labour's 2015 election manifesto.
A Business, Innovation and Skills spokesman said: "The Government is committed to the minimum wage because of the protection it provides to low paid workers and the incentives to work it provides.
"It is important that we have a minimum wage that helps as many low paid workers as possible, while at the same time making sure that we do not damage their employment prospects by setting it too high."
Food trucks are heading to the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport as part of its new terminal. The South Terminal will feature an outdoor patio looking out at the airplane runway with two rotating food trucks. The trucks will operate during scheduled flights, which range from 10:30 a.m. to 9:21 p.m. on Mondays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Sundays.
The first two food trucks parked at the South Terminal are Stacked Sliders and Mellizoz Tacos on Thursday, followed by Stacked Sliders again and Stony Crust Pizza on Friday. Others are planned for the rest of the month. The space features covered awnings and tables.
The retro terminal debuts off Burleson Road on Thursday, April 13, servicing flights from Allegiant Airlines and Texas Sky Airlines. It is completely separate from the airport's main hub, Barbara Jordan Terminal. Travelers can get there by car and shuttle.
A similar idea with food trucks is being floated around for Chicago's two major airports.
The Barbara Jordan Terminal is undergoing its own renovations and expansions, too, including the larger Salt Lick BBQ and a branch of Second Bar + Kitchen.
A dog was found abandoned at a Scottish train station next to a suitcase filled with it's belongings and now the local animal welfare charity are looking for tips into who is the neglectful owner.
The dog, a male shar-pei named Kai, was found sitting with a leash attached to a banister at the Ayr railway station on Jan. 2, according to the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
"Kai is around two to three years old and is a lovely dog with a nice nature," Scottish SPCA Inspector Stewart Taylor said in the group's release.
Amazing Animals From Around the World
The group reported that the suitcase contained a dog bowl, food, a pillow and toy -- although that doesn't clear the owner from wrongdoing.
Abandoning an animal is an offense in Scotland and, if they are able to determine who left the dog in the station, that person or persons could be banned from owning animals for life.
"Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible," Taylor said.
Officials were able to determine the dog's name because the animal had been microchipped by a previous owner. When they contacted that individual, he reported that he had sold the dog in 2013 but did not have any information on the new owner.
Taylor said that the group will care for the dog until they find an owner for Kai.

SAN ANTONIO — San Antonio, the seventh largest city in the United States, isn't getting any smaller.
As city officials like to call it, the “City on the Rise” is one of the fastest growing areas in the country, according to Forbes Magazine.
But just how big is the Alamo City on a world scale?
If San Antonio was a country, it would be the 156th largest nation in the world.
The Alamo City has 1,358,143 people living in 461 square miles.
Some of the 84 countries in the world that have fewer people than San Antonio include vacation destinations like Aruba, The Bahamas, Fiji and Trinidad and Tobago. Also included in the list are European and Middle Eastern countries like Cyprus, Bahrain, Montenegro and Malta.

A computer contractor has been convicted of planting a logic bomb on the servers of Fannie Mae, the financially troubled US housing and mortgage giant.
Rajendrasinh Babubhai Makwana, 36, responded to the termination of his two-year-long spell as a software development contractor at Fannie Mae in October 2008 by planting a malicious script designed to wipe all the data from its network on 31 January 2009. Anyone attempting to access data on the system after the logic bomb went off would have received the message "Server Graveyard".
Fortunately, Fannie Mae sysadmins found the malware days after Makwana left work at the Urbana, Maryland technology centre and weeks before the logic bomb was due to explode. Subsequent forensic analysis of computer logs traced the attempted attack back to Makwana's workplace laptop, which yielded more evidence. Because of his job developing software for Unix boxes, Makwana reportedly had access to the full range of Fannie Mae's 5,000 servers.
Even though Fannie Mae undoubtedly had back-up, the attempted attack would have been enormously disruptive and extremely costly - even if it was only partially successful deleting securities and mortgage data. Company representatives testified that it might take as long as a week to fully restore systems using off-site backups if the failed attack had been entirely successful in its malicious aims.
Makwana, who was convicted of computer sabotage and hacking offences punishable by a maximum of 10 years imprisonment by a jury, faces a sentencing hearing on 8 December.
An FBI statement on the case can be found here. Commentary on the practical implications of the attempted attack, and the lessons that might be drawn about the risk from disaffected workers, can be found in a blog post by Sophos here.
Fannie Mae (The Federal National Mortgage Association) and the smaller Freddie Mac (The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) either control or guarantee almost half of all home loans in the US. Shares in Fannie Mae plummeted as a result of the US sub-prime housing crisis but its operations continued thanks to access to low-interest loans and supportive statements from the federal government that its business was vital to the US housing market. ®
Public health officials in Quebec's Lanaudière region, where a measles outbreak has infected 119 people, got a vaccination campaign underway at a local school after learning that an infected child visited it recently.
School and health officials said at a news conference late Thursday afternoon that 93 of the 114 unprotected students at École Intégrée de St-Pierre in Joliette, about 75 kilometres north of Montreal, have now been vaccinated.
The remaining 21 students are forbidden from attending school until further notice.
“We got 3 refusal forms signed by parents,” said Anne-Marie Blanchard, director of public health in the Lanaudière region.
The other 18 students were either absent from school today or did not bring in a signed consent or refusal form.
“The parents of these 18 children will be contacted by the school,” Blanchard said, adding that parents who did not sign a consent form can still have their children vaccinated at their local CLSC. The children can return to school once they have been immunized.
The school's staff members are all protected against the measles.

On Wednesday, it was discovered that a child infected with measles attended the school on Feb. 27.
All staff and students have had their vaccination records checked, and health authorities have begun contacting those with incomplete or no measles immunization.
École Intégrée de St-Pierre has children between the ages of four and 12.
Outbreak began with eugenics community
The ongoing measles outbreak in the Lanaudière region has so far infected 119 people.
The outbreak began after two local families returned from Disneyland in early February, where they contracted the disease.
At least one of the two families who went to Disneyland belongs to the Esprit-Saint eugenics community just outside of Joliette.
A member of the Esprit-Saint Mission told CBC News reporter Thomas Daigle that vaccinations are against the community's beliefs and that their prophet warns them vaccines result in illness. The member confirmed the first cases of measles in the region originated with the community.
The Esprit-Saint eugenics group was founded by Eugène Richer Dit La Flèche in 1913. The community purports to live by and work toward spreading the message of the third member of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit.
A former member of the community said it believes vaccines compromise people's immune systems, and that they feel protected by the spirit of Dit La Flèche, who died in 1925.
Public health officials said Wednesday they believe the number of infections will continue to climb.
TRENTON -- The first case of antibiotic-resistant E coli bacteria in the country has been identified by New Jersey Medical School researchers in an elderly man who had suffered from a severe urinary tract infection, according to a journal article published on Wednesday.
Physicians at University Hospital in Newark successfully treated the 76-year-old male patient with "other antimicrobial agents" in 2014.
But researchers at the Rutgers University medical school revisited the case this year. They concluded broad-spectrum and "last resort" antibiotics could not arrest this strain of Escherichia coli. A similar strain of the illness was last reported in China, according to the article.
"The good news is that this did not cause a major outbreak of drug-resistant infection," said senior study author Barry N. Kreiswirth, the founding director of the Public Health Research Institute Tuberculosis Center at the medical School.
"The bad news is that since this occurred two years ago, there are clearly other strains out there we haven't detected yet," Kreiswirth said.
Rutgers begins new institution on infectious diseases
The patient developed the infection after he suffered a perforated bladder during a examination of his kidneys. E. coli is the most common cause of urinary tract infections. Rubber tubes were surgically inserted to help drain the kidneys.
"These strains are probably already in the community and could spread further, essentially building toward a situation where you're going to have difficult if not impossible to treat urinary infections," said lead study author Jose R. Mediavilla, a research teaching specialist.
E coli can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps, and potentially death for some people seniors and young children.
The article is published this week in mBio, an online open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology.

Investigators at Stanford University have found a surprising link between creative problem-solving and heightened activity in the cerebellum, a structure located in the back of the brain and more typically thought of as the body's movement-coordination center.
In designing the study, the researchers drew inspiration from the game Pictionary.
The cerebellum, traditionally viewed as the brain's practice-makes-perfect, movement-control center, hasn't been previously recognized as critical to creativity. The new study, a collaboration between the School of Medicine and Stanford's Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, commonly known as the d.school, is the first to find direct evidence that this brain region is involved in the creative process.
"Our findings represent an advance in our knowledge of the brain-based physiology of creativity," said the study's senior author, Allan Reiss, MD, professor of radiology and of psychiatry and behavioral sciences.
The study, to be published May 28 in Scientific Reports, also suggests that shifting the brain's higher-level, executive-control centers into higher gear impairs, rather than enhances, creativity.
"We found that activation of the brain's executive-control centers -- the parts of the brain that enable you to plan, organize and manage your activities -- is negatively associated with creative task performance," said Reiss, who holds the Howard C. Robbins Professorship in Psychiatry and the Behavioral Sciences.
"Creativity is an incredibly valued human attribute in every single human endeavor, be it work or play," he continued. "In art, science and business, creativity is the engine that drives progress. As a practicing psychiatrist, I even see its importance to interpersonal relationships. People who can think creatively and flexibly frequently have the best outcomes."
The collaboration began about 3 ½ years ago when Grace Hawthorne, MFA, MBA, a consulting associate professor at the d.school who teaches a design-thinking skills course called "Creative Gym," and one of her students approached Reiss, who has previously studied humor and other higher-level cognitive functions. They asked if he could objectively measure creativity, the better to confirm that Hawthorne's course can enhance it.
"We didn't know that much about how to do that," Reiss said. "So we decided to design a study that would give us baseline information on creativity's underlying neurophysiological processes."
How do you measure creativity?
As much as creativity may be in demand, it's not so easy to measure. At least 25 or 30 previous studies, mostly of professionally creative people such as jazz musicians and Emmy Award winners, have tried to look at neural correlates of creativity, said the study's lead author, Manish Saggar, PhD, an instructor in psychiatry and a member of the teaching team at the d.school.
"Everybody wants to think creatively," Saggar said. "But how do you get somebody to actually do that on command? Forcing people to think creatively may actually hamper creativity."
The problem is exacerbated by the fact that subjects' brain processes are monitored while they're confined inside a dark, cramped MRI chamber. This environment is not exactly the first place that comes to mind when you're thinking about places where creativity can flower, Saggar said.
"Creativity has to be measured in a fun environment," he said. "Otherwise, you're bound to have anxiety and performance issues."
Saggar came up with the idea of borrowing an approach from Pictionary, a game in which players try to convey a word through drawing to help their teammates guess what the word is. He selected action words like "vote," "exhaust" and "salute." Then he, Reiss and their colleagues serially tested 14 men and 16 women in an MRI chamber, recording activity throughout their brains via functional MRI scans while they drew either a word or, for comparison, a zigzag line, which required initiation and fine-motor control but not much creativity. Participants were given 30 seconds per word, long enough for a decent scan but short enough to elicit spontaneous improvisation and stave off boredom.
"We didn't tell anyone, 'Be creative!' We just told them, 'Draw the word,'" Reiss said.
The drawings were captured on a special MRI-safe electronic tablet designed by study co-author Robert Dougherty, PhD, research director at the Stanford Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging. The drawings were then sent to Hawthorne and Adam Royalty, a researcher at the d.school and co-author of the study. Hawthorne and Royalty separately rated the drawings on five-point scales of appropriateness -- did it depict what it was supposed to? -- and creativity -- how many elements were in the drawing? How elaborate was it? How original?
When they emerged from the MRI chamber, subjects were asked to rate the words they'd been asked to draw for relative difficulty. Increasing subjective difficulty of drawing a word correlated with increased activity in the left prefrontal cortex, an executive-function center involved in attention and evaluation. But high creativity scores later assigned by the raters were associated with low activity in the executive-function center. Higher creativity scores were associated with higher activation in the cerebellum.
On analysis, a number of brain areas were more active when subjects were engaged in drawing words than when they were drawing zigzag lines. Peak activation occurred in the cerebellum and regions of the cortex known to be involved in coordinating motor control or acting as a visual sketchpad. The latter regions' involvement in detailed drawing wasn't particularly surprising.
'The more you think about it, the more you mess it up'
But the heightened activity in the cerebellum was unexpected, as was its association with high creativity scores subsequently assigned by the raters. In monkeys, this brain region has been found to be especially active in learning and practicing new movements.
But those monkey findings may have thrown researchers off, Saggar said. Newer studies show that, unlike the monkey cerebellum, the human cerebellum has robust connections not only to the motor cortex, the brain's higher movement-control center, but to the other parts of the cortex as well.
"Anatomical and, now, functional evidence point to the cerebellum as doing much more than simply coordination of movement," Saggar said.
He and his colleagues speculate that the cerebellum may be able to model all new types of behavior as the more frontally located cortical regions make initial attempts to acquire those behaviors. The cerebellum then takes over and, in an iterative and subconscious manner, perfects the behavior, relieving the cortical areas of that burden and freeing them up for new challenges.
"It's likely that the cerebellum is the coordination center for the rest of brain, allowing other regions to be more efficient," said Reiss.
"As our study also shows, sometimes a deliberate attempt to be creative may not be the best way to optimize your creativity," he said. "While greater effort to produce creative outcomes involves more activity of executive-control regions, you actually may have to reduce activity in those regions in order to achieve creative outcomes."
Saggar put it more bluntly. "The more you think about it, the more you mess it up," he said.
YOUNG gun Mitchell Moses has knocked back a $3 million three-year offer to remain at Wests Tigers and is asking for an immediate release to switch to Parramatta after signing a two-year deal with the Eels from 2018.
Two days after new coach Ivan Cleary told the Tigers players they needed to make a decision about whether they wanted to be on the team bus or not, the club is now faced with a tough decision.
Club boss Justin Pascoe has denied the request for an immediate release.
Do the Tigers dig their heels in and make him play out the rest of the season? Or do they let him join the Eels immediately because there's no point having a player at your club who doesn't want to be there?
The decision is NOT about money.
If it was then the local junior would be staying at Concord.
The Eels have convinced Moses the best thing for his football development is to link with a strong pack of forwards with dynamic edge backrowers.

Beau Scott makes a damn good body guard. So too Manu Mau.
Given the basket case the Tigers have been for the past 18 months, can you blame him?
It's a live hand grenade for new coach Ivan Cleary and CEO Justin Pascoe.
If Moses is granted the release he's asking for, it could mean the local junior lines up against the Tigers in the Easter Monday blockbuster at ANZ Stadium in round seven.
From a Parramatta Eels point of view, it's a huge coup.
They're guaranteed to get Moses for next year and beyond but if they can lure him west for the rest of this season then they're a genuine chance of competing for the premiership.
If it happens this season, look for Moses to play halfback and Corey Norman to return to playing five-eighth. Clint Gutherson is so versatile he can play anywhere in the Eels backline.
There are two very different versions of events in terms of why Moses has asked for an immediate release.
The Wests Tigers' version is that the club pulled his $3 million offer on Wednesday morning. They put that statement out Wednesday night. If that's true, then why did the club board only rubber-stamp the deal five days earlier?
Was it the influence of new coach Ivan Cleary? Possibly.
The Moses camp maintain they told the Tigers on Wednesday morning they were headed elsewhere in 2018.
They say that's when the Tigers decided to play the salary cap line and pull the offer.
Wherever the truth is, one fact remains the latest offers to the “big four” were only submitted last Friday. Not four or five months ago. The whole charade smacks of a basket case club. Even worse, this could only just be the beginning.

THE NRL player transfer market is about to explode with big-name players trading clubs.
Wests Tigers coach Jason Taylor's sacking and Cooper Cronk's shock announcement about leaving the Storm have triggered a domino effect that could have implications for so many clubs.
For starters, the Wests Tigers look like they're only going to retain one of the four favourite son local juniors who've created so many headlines over the last six months.
Ben Ikin, Nathan Ryan and Ben Glover are joined by Storm football manager Frank Ponissi to discuss the bombshell Cooper Cronk news and what it means for the club.

Halfback Luke Brooks has agreed to a two-year deal worth $1.5 million.
That's currently in a 10-day cooling-off period.
Given the basket case that is the Tigers front office, there is no guarantee Brooks won't change his mind.
Captain Aaron Woods appears set to accept a huge offer to join Des Hasler at Canterbury on a four-year deal, with the Bulldogs also making a play for James Tedesco.
The smoky for Tedesco's services is the Sydney Roosters, who up until now have said they won't be chasing the NSW Origin fullback due to a falling-out between chairman Nick Politis and Tedesco's agent, Isaac Moses.
Tedesco enjoys a strong rapport with Roosters legend Anthony Minichiello. Over the course of the last fortnight, the Tricolours have become a serious player.
What powerful Roosters chairman Politis wants, he normally gets.
Forget all the speculation over the course of the last six months, the Tigers only formally tabled all four players their latest official offers last Friday.

Woods has been offered a four-year deal while Tedesco's deal is for the same term worth $4.5 million.
It's a two-year deal with a two-year option in Tedesco's favour.
With the Tigers trio looking more like leaving than staying at Concord, the move will trigger a flurry of other activity.
It will mean Ivan Cleary has a huge cheque book to enter the open market.
Cooper Cronk's departure from Melbourne will free up close to $1 million, while Billy Slater's future could also mean the Storm are cashed-up with as much as $2 million.
Dragons pair Josh Dugan and Gareth Widdop are guaranteed to attract plenty of interest depending on where the other cards fall.
If the Tigers lose Tedesco and Moses, do they make a play? The latest moves have sent phones buzzing all over the NRL.

THE rumblings about Kieran Foran linking with the Bulldogs next season are growing louder by the day.
The Warriors are still hopeful of having a crack at retaining the Kiwi Test playmaker.
Given the way CEO Jim Doyle has backed him, by rights they should be a strong chance.
The other big-name Warriors half off-contract is Shaun Johnson.
This is where things could get very interesting in relation to the Tigers and the Storm.
New Tigers coach Ivan Cleary coached Johnson to a grand final in his debut NRL season in 2011.

THE way Paul McGregor has turned the Dragons from a pop-gun into a serious contender is one of the best storylines of the new season.
The same goes for Trent Barrett at the Manly Sea Eagles.
It's ironic the two played in the 1999 grand final together for St George Illawarra, remain great mates and will face off this Saturday at Lottoland, AKA the old Fortress Brookvale.
Last season it took the Dragons 10 rounds to score 100 points.
This year they lead the competition in terms of points scored on 128 after five rounds.
They've also claimed the scalps of premiership favourites the Panthers and premiers Cronulla at Southern Cross Stadium.
At the start of the season McGregor was the coach plenty of people tipped to be the first sacked.
This time last year he'd agreed to a contract extension with the Dragons before the club pulled the deal when the losses began to mount.
After a brilliant start to the year, the next month will likely determine whether Mary earns a new contract with the Red V.
From our point of view, he's already shown he deserves one.
After the Sea Eagles on Saturday, the Dragons face the Cowboys, the Roosters and the Storm. Yep, the Dragons are about to find out exactly how strongly they're really travelling.
There is no point in kicking sticks around over Stardew Valley's similarities to the Harvest Moon series, Natsume's long-running farmlife simulator. Not to be confused with the also really good Neil Young album, “Harvest Moon”, which Stardew Valley does not riff upon outside of the honkey tonk atmosphere in the single's bar waltz music video. And that is probably a coincidence.
Stardew Valley is an homage, a Sand up, and there is little mistake to make about that. It likes Harvest Moon a lot, and those who like Harvest Moon will probably like it in return. It likes the graces of the seasons, drifts of winter snow and spring's cherry blossoms breezing through the air. It likes the innocent and isolated towns, full of mild-quirk townsfolk and not a one among them threatening. It likes escaping there, the prologue having an emphasis on fleeing an office cubicle. It likes filling a wooden box with grown produce, foraged flowers, and fish. It likes falling in love and getting married. It likes having a playful dog.
We see games in love a lot. Games that love Mario and Zelda, and wear that love on their sleeve; they're in high supply. The more important question is, when love letters blush this hard, why would you play simulacra over the simulated? In small gestures, which mount enough to fill a silo, you can spot the fork in the road where the cultures and the sentiments between the American-made Stardew Valley and Japanese-made Harvest Moon's split.
the different sentiments between the American Stardew Valley and Japanese Harvest Moon show
The first thing you'll notice upon arriving to your little farm is that it is massive. It would be in-game weeks before I bothered seeing its full parameters. It's initially so overrun with rocks, tall grass, and unwanted trees that I felt like Bart Simpson asking Mrs. Glick which ones are the weeds, hoping I wouldn't need the iodine. I cut myself the land around my house to farm, holding off the rest indefinitely. Whereas Harvest Moon is conservative on the space, forcing you to be strategic with agriculture,the strategy in Stardew Valley is the opposite. It tests your modesty if you decide to build a beansprout Babylon—a god who makes themselves a garden so big even they couldn't water it every blinking day.
And you can go big, too. Like Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley has a stamina bar, but it's much more generous. You'll get bored of farming before you get tired. For a while, I simply couldn't find enough farming in the day to spend my energy on, instead exploring, fishing, and dabbling with the payloads of side-quests and minigames throughout the town. The excess strength is, perhaps, in reserve for crazier weekdays. Stardew Valley has all these things it wants you to enjoy.
The Harvest Moon games project a fairly Japanese mentality that work—successful labour day in and day out—is its own zen-like reward, hard lives lived well. Stardew Valley has far more rewards, treasures in a mini-roguelike cave crawling quest, a far off desert to explore, a museum to curate, courting a mall goth or just the satisfaction of spelling out your favourite meme in cauliflower across your estate. Produce is also more expensive in Japan, and each piece of purchasable produce has an element of craftsmanship. Perfect dodgeball-sized apples are the standard and a meal-sized portion, while the west is familiar with bags in bulk as to compliment a balanced diet. Even the locations of your home, in Stardew Valley starting on the left, Harvest Moon often on the right, seems to shadow how one reads English and Japanese. That, again, is probably just an odd coincidence.
There are bounties on potatoes and fish you can fill. There are dozens of local yocals to socialize with, from the shopkeepers to the survivalist living in a tent to the literal wizard. The wizard is introduced as part of a side-plot to save the magical-slime infested community center. Saving the decrepit town institution links arms with a different side-plot involving a Wal-Mart conglomerate muscling in, eying the land, and threatening the community's fragile essence.
the expanse of farmland is clearly given to you in a Minecraft-ian gesture
Stardew Valley has a lot of things. It's got scents of Animal Crossing in there; some of the collection and decorational aspects. And the expanse of farmland is clearly given to you in a Minecraft-ian gesture, encouraging you to go wild with your detailed visions of gardening or ornate crop circle patterns to maintain. Harvest Moon is not that game, and its bells and whistles are traditionally much more limited, structured, and harder circled on the calendar. Despite all odds, it seems Stardew Valley is a different game than the one it mimics. And a pretty fun, different game at that.
There will be plenty of overlap between the kind of players who enjoy both games, but wary be the worker who is concerned with the grit within the soil.
Members of the ACO perform in the shearing shed at Gnaraloo Station. Credit:Ed Sloane It was bold. It was brave. It was expensive - $250,000-plus, according to the ACO. It was also fun. ''Look at that, eh?'' Tognetti said, sitting in his tent overlooking the Indian Ocean. The heat was like a hammer; the wind incessant. We were both feeling salty and pleasantly sore, having been surfing all morning. ''I don't know how we ever convinced the ACO board to have us here.'' To chamber music traditionalists - to anyone - The Reef must seem a strange idea. In one sense the project is a marriage of Tognetti's two great passions, music and surfing. For Tognetti, who grew up in Wollongong and rides a highly experimental - and fiendishly difficult - finless surfboard, surfing is ''the perfect intersection of mind, physical culture and art''. Exploring what he sees as the natural dialogue between these two pursuits has allowed him to take the ACO into uncharted territory, not only in terms of the music itself, but its audience. Traditional classical-music audiences, the kind who fill recital halls and opera houses, are not being replenished: The Reef, then, is one way of tapping into a whole new market - one comprised not only of surfers, but of anyone who has a relationship with the ocean.
A quick surf check. Credit:Ed Sloane In structure at least, The Reef follows on from the ACO's Musica Surfica (2008) project and The Glide (2009), a genre-busting multimedia performance that combined live music by the ACO with footage of the ocean and surfers, most of it shot by Victorian cinematographer Jon Frank. As with The Glide, The Reef will use pre-existing music from the ACO repertoire and new material, written at Gnaraloo. Accompanying the music will be a 100-minute film shot by Frank and directed by Mick Sowry, a Torquay-based filmmaker who also directed Musica Surfica and The Glide. (Interestingly, Sowry was never actually asked to direct the film. ''I just happened to look at the Opera House's website one day and came across an ad for something called The Reef, which said, 'Directed by Mick Sowry'. That was the first I knew about it,'' he says.) Cellist Julian Thompson hits a bum note. Credit:Ed Sloane Sowry's film will involve lots of surfing, particularly of the finless variety, courtesy of Derek Hynd, an idiosyncratic former Australian pro surfer-cum-guru of ''friction-free'' (finless) wave riding, and young Californian surfing savant Ryan Burch. But Sowry's film will also be conceptual, an impressionistic rendering of a day in the life of Ningaloo Reef, a timeless place across which humans float like motes, tiny sparks that appear and disappear into eternity.
Gnaraloo itself is ancient, raw and forbiddingly remote, a moon-like swathe of saltbush and sand two hours' drive north of Carnarvon. It is accessible only by four-wheel-drive. There is no fresh water and no power. There is, on the other hand, mobile phone reception, but only if you are very tall and the wind is blowing in the right direction. Richard Tognetti rehearses. Credit:Tim Elliott There's a knowingness you get from the dust, the surf, which becomes subtext for the music. Planning the adventure began in 2009, but just months before kick-off, Mark Atkins, one of the two indigenous musicians slated to take part [see box, overleaf], was diagnosed with bowel cancer and underwent surgery. (He still attended.) Then, a month before he was due to arrive at Gnaraloo, composer Iain Grandage's wife had a baby, making his participation sensitive, to say the least. To top it off, Hynd and girlfriend Taylor Miller, whose car journey from Byron Bay to WA was to be part of Sowry's film, rolled their vehicle on the Buntine Highway, 1000 kilometres from Broome.
Indigenous musician Mark Atkins. Credit:Edward Sloane Miller had to be flown to Darwin for treatment, while Hynd set out to procure a new windscreen and tyre. He failed to find a windscreen (they drove to Broome wearing goggles) but the mechanic who sold them the tyre threw in a half-dingo puppy, free. Hynd christened it Buntine. When I arrive, a day-and-a-half after leaving Sydney, Gnaraloo has the appearance of a Bedouin camp - if Bedouins had somehow discovered surfing. There are boards and wetsuits everywhere, lots of dust, half-drunk bottles of wine, a fire pit; snatches of violin in distant caravans. One night, in a crowded, dimly lit tent, Tognetti and violinist Satu Vanska rehearse one of The Reef's more contemporary pieces, a reworking of the Alice in Chains song Them Bones, with cellist Julian Thompson. For the vocals, Tognetti recruits two surfers, Craig, a tall guy with an extravagant handlebar moustache, and a long-haired bloke named Clay, who stand side by side, beers in hand, bashing it out like Vikings at a wake. I want to ask how such a song will fit into the final show, but pinning Tognetti down isn't easy: he is either in his tent or arranging music or sleeping or eating. And when he isn't doing any of these, he is surfing.
Indeed, surfing seems to be the first priority of the residency: the state of the waves, tides and wind dictate the shape of the day. (As well as two surfboards, Tognetti brought along a professional surf forecaster, Steve Shearer, a man whose command of a synoptic chart is nothing short of forensic.) As a surfer myself, Tognetti's approach seems eminently sensible. Here, after all, are some of the best waves in Australia: long, heaving walls of water, jade-green and sun-flared, pulsing out of the ocean like a drumbeat, with their smoking crests and wind-whipped peaks. The ocean here is deep and clear and alarmingly alive: one day while out surfing, a giant manta ray sails underneath my board; on another occasion, Frank is in the water filming Miller when they are surrounded by a posse of curious reef sharks. The sun, the sand, the wind, the water; to stand on the beach here after a long surf is to feel yourself, as Albert Camus wrote in The Sea Close By, ''at the heart of a royal happiness''. But how does this feed back into the music? On this, Tognetti is a little vague. Certainly he believes that finless surfing represents ''an adventure in going beyond your limits'', an ethos he is keen to instil in his orchestra. Grandage, the composer, is more succinct. ''The most obvious point of contact will be in the euphoric, virtuosic free-form music,'' he tells me. ''But there is also a knowingness you get from just being here, from the dust, the sound of the blowholes and the surf, all of which becomes subtext for the music.''
Grandage was also inspired by local references - the landing of Dutch navigator Dirk Hartog, in 1616, at Cape Inscription, 150 kilometres away, and the wreck of the Batavia, off Geraldton, further south, in 1629. ''There's a piece I've written, called Underneath,'' Grandage says, ''based on the idea that a shipwreck through nature's course becomes part of nature itself; that even the skeletons of the dead become part of the reef.'' Because he has worked extensively in theatre, which is collaborative, Grandage feels comfortable with the nature of the residency, which can be described, at best, as ''organic'' and, at worst, ''total chaos'', with what ends up being 50 people - musicians, surfers, film and sound guys, personal assistants and PR people, caterers, photographers, journalists, even a former SAS safety consultant - all pulling in different directions. When I first arrive, I find it hard to believe that anything coherent can come of this, but am told ''don't worry'', that things will ''come together''. Just go with it. This seems like baloney to me. But then one morning a PR woman named Chryss and I get lost while driving to meet Tognetti and the others at a secret surf spot. Getting lost in Gnaraloo is incredibly easy: there are million sand tracks out here and they all look the same. When it is clear that we have no idea where we are, we stop and make jokes about ''how Wolf Creek this is''. Maybe we will have to eat one another. As it turns out, Chryss is a vegetarian, which is the best news I've heard all week. Eventually a Land Rover comes up behind us: the driver is going to the same spot as us; he will show us the way. ''See,'' Chryss says, ''just go with it.''
On the way back from the surf I get a lift with Tognetti, who - having been here for two weeks - knows his way around. At last, I think, my chance has come to grill him about the music, his vision, about where all this is headed. The car crests a slight rise in the track, one that affords a panoramic view of the reef and the ocean. He stops, and we sit in silence. He points to a bombora, far out to sea, where a wave is breaking. ''We surfed that the other day,'' he says. ''So amazing. Don't think I've ever gone so fast.'' Then he starts up the car again, and we drive back to camp for lunch. On the final night of the residency, there's a concert in the shearing shed of nearby Gnaraloo Station. Miraculously, the ACO has sold 190 tickets. Right on sunset, the crowd starts arriving: farmhands, fishermen and surfers, owners of adjacent stations, locals from Carnarvon, everyone ambles in with their wines and beers to sit on plastic chairs under a hot tin roof, a tornado of giant moths whirring about their heads. ''It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience,'' one woman tells me, looking as if she is about to cry. The program is typically Tognetti: an improbable mix of classics - Beethoven, Pachelbel's Canon - with pieces that should eventually make their way into The Reef, such as the Viking-like Them Bones, and a nostalgic acoustic piece by Steve Pigram. There is also Atkins on guitar and didgeridoo, and a version of Pete Seeger's anti-war anthem Where Have All the Flowers Gone?, sung by Vanska with a poise and clarity that appears to stop time. But the music of the moment goes beyond the instruments; it's in the clinking of the beer bottles, the young kids yelling, ''Look, daddy, look!'', the hush of a crowd that can't believe what it's seeing. It's in the sound of the sea, just over the dunes.
The local link As talented as they are unsung, indigenous musicians Mark Atkins (pictured) and Steve Pigram formed the local connection for the ACO's Gnaraloo residency. Atkins, 54, now lives near Tamworth but was born in Albany and grew up "near a swamp out the back of Perth". Perhaps best known for his didgeridoo playing, he also excels on guitar and has collaborated with Philip Glass and the London Philharmonic Orchestra and has performed at New York's Lincoln Centre. Pigram is from Broome, where he forms one seventh of the Pigram Brothers. "I've actually got nine brothers, but only six of them play in the band with me." His musicality is prodigious: he plays everything from acoustic guitar and requinto to harmonica, ukulele and dulcimer. "Doing this with Richard [Tognetti] is really a chance to showcase the majesty of Ningaloo," says Pigram, who also worked as musical director on Bran Nue Dae.
Pigram's music is about family, riverbeds and rainstorms - "nature, really". He worries that the same pro-mining mentality that waved through the $30 billion James Price Point gas plant on the Kimberley Coast could also threaten this part of Australia. "It's unique - it's desert meeting sea," he says. "It's about time we recognised that some things should not be touched." The Reef is a co-production of the ACO with Tura New Music. It will play at the Sydney Opera House on July 23. See aco.com.au. The writer travelled to Gnaraloo Station as a guest of the Australian Chamber Orchestra and Tura New Music.
Ontario Finance Minister Charles Sousa unveiled plans this afternoon for 10 LCBO liquor kiosks to open in grocery stores as part of a one-year pilot program.
The plan would allow for the rollout of selected LCBO Express stores-within-a-store, which would open by the end of the year. The special kiosks would be available to grocery stores that can set aside at least 2,000 square feet of retail space for the LCBO.
"Ontario consumers have long asked for more convenient options, and we're listening," Sousa said at a LCBO in Toronto, calling the move a step in the right direction that will be socially responsible while also promoting local craft beers and Ontario wines.
We've got to toast to the success of the LCBO's expansion. - Ontario Finance Minister Charles Sousa
Sousa concluded the formal statement with a clink of glasses, sipping from an award-winning Old Credit brew from Port Credit, Ont.
He said the rollout will begin with a pilot of 10 stores. Purchases of wine, beer and spirits will be paid for at the kiosk, to the LCBO.
"We've got to toast to the success of the LCBO's expansion," he said, joining LCBO President and CEO Bob Peters with a cheers. "Here's to Express stores, here's to you guys, thank you."
Sousa told reporters that LCBO Express stores-within-stores will operate on the same hours as regular LCBO locations.
The LCBO issued a Request for Proposals today for up to seven Express stores and will be accepting proposals until May 9, 2014.
The government said the LCBO will work in partnership with public health agencies to educate the public about responsible alcohol consumption.
The estimated value of the province's alcohol market in 2012-13 was $10 billion, according to the ministry of finance.
The boss of a protein shake firm who have come under fire for its "beach body ready" campaign claims they have received a bomb threat. Richard Staveley, head of global marketing for Protein World, told ITV's Good Morning Britain there been "violent and physical threats" on the company's head office. He said: "We've had a bomb threat. That's been reported to the police and is currently being investigated but I can't say any more than that." Since the ad, featuring a bikini-clad model with the caption: "Are you beach body ready?" went live, a petition calling for their removal claiming it is negative for people's body image has gathered more than 50,000 signatures.
The ad has been criticised for encouraging women to skip meals in place of a protein shake. Credit: GMB
Protests are even planned in Hyde Park this weekend on Saturday May 3 calling for women and men of all sizes to come down in their bikinis as part of a "Taking back the beach event". A post on Facebook said: "Do you look like the model on the poster? Awesome, step this way, gorgeous! Are you a size 24? Come on down beautiful! Are you a guy? Get those swimming shorts looked out! "Beach ready means different things for everyone, and we want to see all of them."

The chairman of a Chinese financial conglomerate who tried to forge a business relationship with President Trump's son-in-law has been detained by police.
Wu Xiaohui, the chairman of Anbang Insurance Group, was taken away on Friday in Beijing, according to Caijing, a respected newsmagazine. In a statement early Wednesday morning in China, the company said that Mr. Wu was “for personal reasons no longer able to perform his duties.”
Two people briefed on the matter — a company executive and a business partner of Anbang — confirmed that Mr. Wu had been detained.
Mr. Wu, who piloted Anbang's rapid rise to global prominence with splashy purchases like the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Manhattan, is the latest Chinese tycoon to be ensnared in an anti-corruption drive that has swept the country in recent years. Another of China's wealthiest and most politically connected financiers, Xiao Jianhua, was reportedly seized from his luxury hotel in Hong Kong by Chinese police officers and taken over the border in January. He has not been seen publicly since.

On Tuesday, August 8th CALPIRG staff and volunteers will deliver petition signatures from thousands of San Diegans to a local KFC urging the fried chicken giant to stop serving meat raised with the routine use of antibiotics. Speakers will talk about the dangers of antibiotic resistance and how KFC can help stop it.
Antibiotic resistance is quickly becoming public enemy number one among health experts worldwide. This is especially true with the recent emergence of a new “superbug” resistant to a last resort antibiotic, colistin. The majority of the antibiotics sold in the U.S. are for use on livestock and poultry, not in doctors' offices, and often for animals that aren't sick.
Major restaurants like KFC can help stop that misuse of our life-saving medicines, as McDonald's and Subway, and Chick-fil-A have all done.
Event will have great visuals, including backdrop of the KFC store, boxes of thousands of petitions signed by San Diegans and volunteers holding signs in support of saving antibiotics. The event will be held in front of KFC on 2829 University Ave, San Diego on Tuesday, August 8th at 11 a.m.

Guam - Guam's 911 Center received an emergency call before 9pm of an explosion by the Tree Bar area at the Guam Hilton on Tumon Bay. There was a second call made to 911 of a report of another explosion on the third floor, but that turned out to be a false alarm.
Guam Homeland Security, the Guam Fire Department, the Guam Police Department, the FBI, and military officials were on the scene. According to GPD spokesperson Sergeant Liz Flickenger, the damage was excessive and the explosion occurred during a dinner show at the Tree Bar.
Currently, the hotel has evacuated, and guests are standing outside waiting for the all-clear. Others have been offered to stay down the road at the Pacific Islands Club.
Two people were injured during the event - one local female and one Japanese man, both of whom are in their 30s.
More than 300 environmental, peace, and anti-nuclear groups and leaders published an open letter this week urging four prominent climate scientists to stop “embracing nuclear power” as a tool for curbing climate-changing pollution.
In response, one the four scientists reaffirmed his reluctant support for nuclear power, denying that he embraces the technology, but saying there's “no justification” for claims it could never become safe or affordable.
The debate among environmentalists over nuclear power flared up in November, when the four scientists published a letter calling for increased development and deployment of “safer nuclear energy systems.” The letter was written by some of the climate community's best and brightest: NASA scientist-turned-activist James Hansen, Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution for Science, Kerry Emanuel of MIT, and climatologist Tom Wigley.
That letter triggered a cavalcade of opinion articles, many of them arguing that nuclear power is too dangerous and much more expensive than wind and solar power. And now many critics of the scientists' arguments — from tiny groups to big ones like Greenpeace USA and the Environmental Working Group — have united to voice their opposition in this new letter. Here are some highlights:
We respectfully disagree with your analysis that nuclear power can safely and affordably mitigate climate change. Nuclear power is not a financially viable option. Since its inception it has required taxpayer subsidies and publically financed indemnity against accidents. New construction requires billions in public subsidies to attract private capital and, once under construction, severe cost overruns are all but inevitable. As for operational safety, the history of nuclear power plants in the US is fraught with near misses, as documented by the Union of Concerned Scientists, and creates another financial and safety quagmire — high-level nuclear waste. Internationally, we've experienced two catastrophic accidents for a technology deemed to be virtually ‘failsafe'. … Moreover, due to the glacial pace of deployment, the absence of any possibility of strategic technological breakthroughs, and the necessity, as you correctly say, of mitigating climate risks in the near term, nuclear technology is ill-suited to provide any real impact on greenhouse gas emissions in that timeframe. On the contrary, the technologies perfectly positioned now, due to their cost and level of commercialization, to attain decisive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the near term are renewable, energy efficiency, distributed power, demand response, and storage technologies. Instead of embracing nuclear power, we request that you join us in supporting an electric grid dominated by energy efficiency, renewable, distributed power and storage technologies.
Grist asked the climate scientists for a response, and here's an email we received from Caldeira:
Tesla Pickup Truck Looks
During last week's presentation of the new Tesla semi, company chief operating officer Elon Musk introduced associate surprising addition to the Tesla lineup while segueing from the semi to the Roadster: A Tesla pickup truck. This was the second-biggest surprise of the evening, After the Roadster reveal, but with much more emphasis on the word “big.” If the renderings can be believed, the Tesla pickup's bed will swallow a Ford F-150 SuperCrew. Affirming those renderings, Musk said, “It's a pickup truck that can carry a pickup truck.”
The pickup feels like a repurposed Tesla semi tractor, minus one of the drive axles out back. If one among the first Mercedes Unimogs had on the loose the mill in 1946 and evolved in isolation within the Schwarzwald, we'd expect it to emerge looking like Tesla's offering. Musk foreshadowed the arrival of an approximate vehicle in Sep. When Jason Cruickshank tweeted “Can we get a light duty pickup next,” Musk replied, “What if we have a tendency to simply created a mini version of the Tesla semi?”
This isn't exactly light-duty, though, falling well outside the 3 typical categories of truck buyers. Musk said anyone could drive the rendered Tesla pickup with a standard driver's license, which means it would not exceed the specs for a class six medium-duty truck. Vehicles in that class include the Ford F-650 and Chevrolet Kodiak/GMC Topkick siblings (the last of that served as Autobot Ironhide), however, that is the higher finish – the Tesla pickup might look as beefy, but it could take things down a few notches. As it is almost always the case with Tesla, who knows? We'll find out for certain if and when the pickup makes production.
The Russians know how to make you feel welcome. On my first visit to Moscow as British foreign secretary in 2010, whole motorways seemed to have been closed, vodka flowed freely, and the then President Medvedev hosted me at his villa in the woods. They were determined to improve on their terrible relations with the previous Labour government, and so was I.
Yet within two years we were at furious loggerheads over Syria, and the year after that we were falling out over the direction of Ukraine. Faced with Vladimir Putin's invasion and annexation of Crimea, part of another European country, we British were rightly on the side of sanctions, and penalising aggression. The lashings of vodka might as well have been poured down the drain.
This is the sad cycle of two decades of Western relations with Russia: optimism from each incoming US president or British government, then disillusionment brought on by behaviour that cannot be accepted. From killing untold numbers of civilians in the bombing of Aleppo to murdering dissidents in London with radioactive polonium, Russia takes actions we find beyond the pale.
Now a new US president is about to take office with a fresh determination to do business with the Kremlin, this time unencumbered by the disputes of the past, or indeed any particular knowledge of them. If reports are to be believed, Donald Trump will appoint as his secretary of state an oilman who has done many a deal with Moscow and knows Putin personally. While better relations with Russia are a laudable goal, this could be Russia's best chance since the Second World War to weaken and divide the West.
Bathurst 1000: Driver David Reynolds fined for sexist comments about all-female team
Updated
Ford's David Reynolds has been fined $25,000 for making an offensive remark towards an all-female team at the Bathurst 1000.
Ford duo Simona de Silvestro and Renee Gracie are the first female combination to compete at Bathurst since 1998.
V8 Supercars boss James Warburton was quick to slam the "disgraceful" comment, which the ABC has chosen not to publish.
"Reynolds' comments were disgraceful and completely unacceptable in our sport and he has been fined $25,000," Warburton said.
"Women are an integral part of our sport, whether they are fans, drivers or team members.
"And V8 Supercars will continue to support and promote female participation at all levels of our sport."
The female team were already motivated to silence critics at Mount Panorama after V8 great Dick Johnson claimed they were "a million to one" and had no chance of finishing their first Bathurst 1000.
The pair took two seconds off their best time to finish second last in a 26-strong field in the final practice session on Thursday.
Reynolds is known for his left-field humour and was quick to give the female team a rap after his surprise comment.
"I think they are great. They are good drivers. I really hope they do well," said a suddenly sincere Reynolds, who shares the same Ford team garage as the female drivers.
But it was too little, too late.
The female team showed they would not take any lip when they fired back at Johnson on Wednesday.
"Dick Johnson hasn't finished heaps of races so he can't talk," said Gracie.
De Silvestro - one of only three women to notch an IndyCar podium - said before practice it would be good to silence the critics.
"Because the attention is on us if we don't finish it would be a shame," she said.
"There are others who won't either. But I think we will prove them (critics) wrong."
Former Sauber Formula One test driver De Silvestro and Queensland's V8 development series gun Gracie is the first all-female team at Bathurst since 1998.
In all, 31 women have contested the Bathurst 1000 with the best placing of sixth - Australia's Christine Gibson (1981) and France's Marie-Claude Beaumont (1975).
Gracie and de Silvestro will become the 15th all-female entry in the Great Race.

Now that Charles Woodson is retired, there is an undisputed king of Michigan's NFL players: Tom Brady.
U-M fans have long identified themselves with the New England Patriots' four-time Super Bowl champion quarterback and have measured NFL seasons by his success.
Which will make tonight a bit unusual.
Brady's team will be starting the season in a marquee game against Arizona, but Brady won't be on the field. He'll be starting a four-game suspension for his role in Deflategate.
He isn't sure how it will play out.
“I think that's a good word, uncharted, so we'll do the best we can do,” Brady told New England reporters after playing the first half of a Sept. 1 preseason game.
The ultra-competitive Brady will be replaced by Jimmy Garrappolo, and Brady isn't sure how much he can stand to watch.
“I'm sure I'll be very curious and watching at some level, so we'll see,” he said. “I have never dealt with it, so we'll see.”
His suspension began Sept. 3, with no team-related contact with coaches or players, and he cannot attend the Patriots' practices or facility, so he was glad to get snaps in the Sept. 1 game, the last opportunity.
“It all helps,” he said. “The practices are really important, but ultimately the game decisions and getting hit, it's all about decision-making as a quarterback. And you try to replicate it in practice, but at the end of the day it's got to be game situations and real football.”
As New England's fiery leader for the past decade-plus — this is his 17th season since graduating from Michigan following the 1999 college season — Brady has had only one sustained absence since becoming the starter in 2001. In 2008, he wrecked his knee in the season opener, and that team went 11-5 without him.
But he's not worried about someone filling the leadership role.
“We've had so many great leaders on our team that have stepped in and filled the void,” he said. “Coach (Bill) Belichick does a great job of getting the team prepared and motivated. They're going to understand what they need to do. I'll be cheering like hell.”
So what will he do with his time during the suspension (other than visit Michigan as the honorary captain for Saturday's Colorado game) and how does he expect to feel?
“I haven't thought about it much,” he said. “I always take it as it comes. Just do the best I could do.”

During his three seasons with the Eagles, Chip Kelly constantly tinkered with the roster, trying to bring in more players who fit his system, and jettison players who didn't fit. For the most part, that failed, and the Eagles' offense got worse over the course of his tenure in Philadelphia.
But Kelly says he doesn't need to tinker with the roster in San Francisco. Kelly says the kind of talent he needs is already in place. Kelly said the running backs, receivers, tight ends and offensive linemen are all the kinds of players he wants as building blocks of his team.
“Obviously, you look at what Carlos Hyde can do,” Kelly said, via CSNBayArea.com. “He's one of the really good young running backs. There are a bunch of guys at receiver, led by Torrey [Smith], and Torrey really has a skill set because he can run. He's kind of a matchup problem for people.”
Kelly said the tight ends on the roster, Vance McDonald, Garrett Celek and Blake Bell, are a good collection of talent.
“That will be a fun group to work with, in terms of how you disperse them and try to figure out what's going on,” Kelly said.
And although the 49ers' offensive line struggled at times, Kelly thinks it will be in good shape.
“Obviously, the O-line, led by Joe Staley, there's a lot of talent there, too,” Kelly said. “I think it's a good group. . . . Joe Staley is one of the most fit, athletic big people you ever want,” Kelly said. “I met Joe about a week ago. He came in. He fits perfect. It fits to his skill set set. I've always been a big fan of big people. Somebody once told me, ‘Big people beat up little people.' I think we fit philosophically.”
So Kelly has the players he wants everywhere — except maybe at quarterback, where it remains unclear whether Colin Kaepernick, Blaine Gabbert or someone else will start Week One.
The April 5, 2016 issue of The Gleaner, the student paper of Rutgers University–Camden, published a cartoon of Muhammad, Buddha and Jesus in a bar. Then the April 19 issue of The Gleaner contained a letter from the Muslim Brotherhood campus group, the Muslim Students Association, saying that it found the image offensive and asking The Gleaner to remove the image from the April 5 issue and recirculate that issue without it. The MSA letter claims that Christians and Jews on campus told MSA members that they, too, found the image offensive.
The MSA letter states: “Even though freedom of speech and press is emphasized and is something all of us value as proud Americans, the University prides itself on diversity of people of different faith and backgrounds so we feel that it is necessary to respect those faiths and backgrounds by honoring their beliefs.”
The April 19 Gleaner also contains a response to the MSA letter, written by Christopher Church, the Editor-in-Chief of The Gleaner. Church apologizes to the MSA and agrees to meet with it “so that we can rectify this issue and ensure that it doesn't happen again.” He also agrees to remove any copies of the offending April 5 issue from the Gleaner boxes around campus and destroy them.
The Jihad Watch reader who alerted me to this sums up what is wrong here:
1. Freedom of speech is a Constitutional right. It is not negated by someone's taking offense. This could have been and should have been a chance for Rutgers and The Gleaner to explain why the freedom of speech must be protected as our fundamental bulwark against tyranny, and why that means that we must all learn to put up with material that offends us.
2. Once a group's feeling offended is taken as decisive, it may begin to take offense at other aspects of campus life it finds offensive. In the MSA's case, it may begin getting offended at men and women sharing classrooms or coeds wearing tight jeans on campus.
3. In light of the violent attacks on those who have depicted Muhammad, The Gleaner by removing the image is bowing to the implicit threat of violence — which only in the long run encourages more violence. Rutgers' Art Library recently featured an “artwork” depicting Jesus on a dartboard. It was ultimately removed, but not because it offended Christians. No one cares if Christians are offended: Rutgers officials know that offended Christians won't murder them. Their solicitousness toward the MSA, by contrast, reveals that they know offended Muslims might very well kill them, and rather than stand up for the freedom of speech and against this kind of bullying, they signal their willingness to surrender and fall into line, accepting Sharia restrictions on speech.
The Huffington Post (Germany) is posting peoples names and photos who comment on social media opposing the migrant invasion. If you post a comment on their site or Facebook or any social media, you will be named. The Huffington Post is a global news organization. This is putting a target on anyone's head that refuses to go along with the leftist/Islamic war on freedom. These are the lengths the left will go to impose the sharia (Islamic law) on the unwilling.
Pure evil.
I have long said the media is the enemy. It's why I refer to them as the enemedia. They abdicated their role as a news gathering entity and morphed into an activist organization viciously pursuing an anti-freedom agenda.
Germans that are posting anti-refugee posts on Facebook or any other social media site, are being shut down. Facebook, Twitter, etc, and their faces and accounts are being posted. It's a witch hunt.
Chancellor Merkel is working Mark Zuckerberg to censor anti-invasion FB posts.

Hitlerian. Goebbels, actually.
It's a hit list. The photo grid reminds of the 9/11 photo gallery. Targets are the same. Motive is the same – to impose Islam and sharia on the free world.
KHANAQIN, Kurdistan Region – The war against the Islamic State (ISIS) has increased the Arab population of Khanaqin threefold. But because the numbers are still very small, the mayor of this city in the Kurdistan Region does not see this as a source of concern.
“Khanaqin will not become Arabized again, this is not a premeditated occurrence,” said Mayor Muhammad Amin Hassan Hussein, noting that the city's Arab population had gone up because of the fighting from one percent to three percent.
Khanaqin, located in the Garmaser region, was previously part of Kirkuk province. But it was annexed to Diyala province after the Arabization process began by ousted dictator Saddam Hussein. It was the only place that recovered quickly from this process after Saddam fall in 2003.
“After Saddam's fall only one percent of the population of Khanaqin was Arab, and those were the original residents of Khanaqin,” the mayor said.
The city's original residents speak proudly about the mixed ethnicity that used to exist in Khanaqin, with Shiite and Sunni neighbors living peacefully together. Abbas, 59, said that until recently he had not noticed the difference between the city's Shiites and Sunnis.
“The blood of the Shiites and Sunnis in Khanaqin is mixed,” Abbas said about predominantly Shiite city. “Sometimes, when a senior Shiite leader needed blood in the hospital, he was given Sunni blood.”
Muhammad, a 65-year-old teacher, said: “All the different views and beliefs have lived next to one another and worked together. I was a member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party from the outset, but my friends were members of the Communist party. Khanaqin was a city of tolerance.”
But that tolerance does not seem to have passed on to the new generations. The city's young deny there are differences between Shiites and Sunnis. But the sectarian accessories and symbols they attach to their cars and bicycles, speak otherwise.
Muhammad noted one such example with concern.
“The Peshmerga forces have been present in this city for many years, but I have never seen the youth of Khanaqin queue to take a photo with the Peshmerga commanders,” he said. “But since the Shiite militias came, the young were competing to see who would be the first to take a photo with the Shiite commanders.”
The mayor of Khanaqin, working out of a smoke-filled office with a broken air condition and sometimes without electricity, is often criticized for the policy of land distribution in the city. The residents even joke about this issue.
“I have distributed 17,000 land plots among the Kurds and I am not sorry about it. We might also have given some land plots to the original Arad residents as well, who were really good with the Kurds,” said the mayor, who admitted to problems governing without a proper budget.
Khanaqin lies in the so-called “disputed territories” that are claimed by both Baghdad and Erbil.
“Baghdad does not send us anything and there is no money in Erbil, either. We are kind of governing in a decentralized way,” Hussein said.
Many Arab refugees are seen walking in the markets of Khanaqin. They came because of the ongoing war with ISIS in Salahaddin, Diyala and Mosul.
“The security that we have here is something that we never had back in our cities,” said one refugee. “I can come out in the middle of the night and no one would ask if I was an Arab or Kurd. I feel at home here.”
The mayor of does not share the concerns about the increasing number of Arabs in Khanaqin, saying they had come out of necessity, and not as part of another Arabization plan.
The Arabs who come to Khanaqin cannot own properties, he explained. “Not only this, even if they wanted to buy vehicles they cannot have it in their own names. Also, none of them is given food ration certificates or any other document that would tie them to Khanaqin,” said the mayor.
He did admit, however, that for the refugees to return to their original homes would take time.
Maggie Wright of Full Metal Rock conducted an interview with KISS guitarist Tommy Thayer prior to the band's May 7 show at Oslo Spektrum in Oslo, Norway. You can listen to the full chat below. A few excerpts follow (transcribed by BLABBERMOUTH.NET).
On how the band approaches choosing songs for their live setlist:
Tommy: "That's always a challenge, because there's so much back material and so many records that have been recorded over the years. The first KISS record came out in 1974, so we're looking at forty-three, going on forty-four years now, that's a lot of material to choose from. And, of course, you have the classics and so many people are depending on hearing those songs and if you don't play them, they get pretty pissed off. Then there are die-hard fans, the purists, who want to hear the deeper cuts, we try to throw a few things in. But then again, the masses, it's crickets sometimes with some of those songs. It's a fine line. We try to balance it out the best we can."
On why KISS often doesn't play any material from their most recent studio album, 2012's "Monster":
Tommy: "Again, you've got the classic songs, and I'm going to be honest with you: Not as many people know the stuff that's on 'Monster', the most recent record that came out a couple of years ago. Just because, as you know, records aren't selling like they used to. The record business is in a huge decline. The sales aren't there. People aren't getting the new music as much. So I guess that's reflected when we decide on what songs to play."
On going up on one of KISS's many stage lifts:
Tommy: "Luckily, I don't have a fear of heights and that sort of thing. Paul [Stanley, guitar/vocals], actually gets a little shaky. He gets clammy hands when we come down at the beginning of the show. [Laughs] Going up on those lifts, you just have to have faith in the fact that they're really professionally put together and it's all really rehearsed and it's safe. That's the most important thing to begin with. You go up on those things the first few times and it's even higher when you get up there than it looks from where you're standing down below."
On getting comfortable being a part of KISS after formally replacing Ace Frehley in 2002:
Tommy: "By the time we toured the first year I was in the band, we were touring the U.S. and North America and we played shows like at Madison Square Garden. I remember being onstage, for instance, at the Garden, I'm thinking 'Oh My God. How did this happen?' It's kind of mind-blowing."
On whether his career path resembles the 2001 "Rock Star" movie that starred actor Mark Wahlberg:
Tommy: "It's a lot like that movie, actually. People have referenced that before. They say 'Your story, Tom, is a lot like that 'Rock Star' movie that Mark Wahlberg was in.' It's kinda like that. It's like a real-life version of that. I think that was based on the JUDAS PRIEST thing, [Tim] 'Ripper' Owens and his whole thing. He was a big fan and played in a tribute band and got to be in JUDAS PRIEST for a while. It's very interesting. When you put your mind to something, it's interesting how life evolves and reveals itself. People say 'Tommy, you're smart. You have this all planned.' Actually, I didn't. It all happened in a weird way, one thing leading to another. I didn't have a big long-term plan. I just loved doing it and being around the music business and being in bands. I just followed my passion and this is where it ended up, which is very cool."
On KISS's willingness to put its name on various merchandise:
Tommy: "It's interesting because KISS really is an enigma. KISS is a different band than your average-type band. Most bands, people say, 'Oh, where's your credibility? You can't do that kind of thing, or this, or 'Scooby-Doo'. Come on.' KISS, we can pull it off. We can do it."
KISS kicked off its month-long "KissWorld" tour on May 1 at the Olympijskiy Stadium in Moscow, Russia and has European dates scheduled through May 31 at London's O2 Arena.
“For if one link in nature's chain might be lost, another and another might be lost, till this whole system of things should vanish by piece-meal.”
~ Thomas Jefferson, 1799
This much is clear: As human numbers have grown, the number of species with whom we share the planet has declined dramatically. While it took about 200,000 years for humanity to reach one billion people around 1800, world population has grown sevenfold since then, surpassing seven billion last year.
At the same time, we are witnessing the greatest mass extinction of plant and animal life in the history of human civilization; every year, some 30,000 species become extinct, about three per hour.
The relationship between these two phenomena is not simple. Human impact on the environment is mediated by a host of factors, including culture, technology, institutions, and market forces. And inequitable socioeconomic systems mean that some human beings have far greater impact than others.
But some generalizations can be made. We live on a planet dominated and transformed by human activity. As we have become more numerous, we have also become more adept at altering ecosystems for human use, replacing species-rich natural landscapes with simpler monocultures.
In the last 200 years, human activity has greatly accelerated the rate of species loss. Duke University's Stuart Pimm and his colleagues calculate that current extinction rates are between 100 and 1,000 times greater than in pre-human times (though more recent studies question whether those numbers are inflated).
Loss of Biodiversity Risks Health of Ecosystems, Economies
That loss of biological diversity (biodiversity, for short) has profound implications for the future of life on Earth. Johan Rockström and his colleagues at the Stockholm Resilience Centre have estimated “planetary boundaries” that humanity cannot cross without massive risks to ecosystem health. They conclude that the boundary for biodiversity loss has already been transgressed, and as a result, many ecosystems have lost the resilience conferred by diversity and are at heightened risk of collapse.
Biodiversity also provides essential – if uncalculated – economic benefits. One study by Conservation International measured the economic value of ecosystem services to poor communities in priority areas for conservation. The authors found that keeping habitats intact was worth three times as much as exploiting them for short-term gain. The UN's report on The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) measured the value of intact ecosystems for the poorest people: In India, 47 percent of the income of the poorest comes directly from ecosystems; in Brazil, that figure rises to 89 percent.
Often, the value of biodiversity becomes apparent only when it is lost. For example, with the global decline of honeybee populations, growers can now calculate the monetary value of pollination services that were once provided for free by nature. “Bee pollination is worth $190 billion,” said Pavan Sukhdev, a Yale environmental economist, in an interview with Bloomberg. “But when did a bee ever send you an invoice?”
Population Dynamics Are Significant, But Not Singular, Driver
While the broad association between biodiversity loss and the growth of the human enterprise seems clear enough, the loss of any given species or habitat results from a combination of interlocking demographic, social, political, and economic factors.
In the Amazon rainforest, one of the world's premier biodiversity hotspots, most deforestation results from conversion of land for agriculture, primarily soy grown for export to China. Rising affluence in Asia, therefore, is a more important driver of biodiversity loss in the Amazon than local population growth. In an ever-more globalized economy, local environmental damage is increasingly connected to global market forces.
But population dynamics do play a significant role, according to Jason Bremner, program director for population, health, and the environment at the Population Reference Bureau. Throughout the Amazon, small-scale farmers initially clear the forest, in hopes of selling the land to consolidators or speculators, Bremner said in an interview. Those smallholders are often migrants attracted to frontiers of the Amazon in search of land and a livelihood because of inequitable land distribution and unsustainable population density in their home regions.
According to a meta-analysis of case studies conducted by Helmut Geist and Eric Lambin in 2001, such population dynamics constitute an “underlying cause” of 61 percent of tropical deforestation. But they warn against a reductive focus on any single factor, such as population or poverty: “the interplay of several proximate as well as underlying factors drive deforestation in a synergetic way,” they write. And, because the interplay of factors is highly contextual, there is no “universal policy” for preventing the loss of habitat and biodiversity.
At a fundamental level though, said University of California-Santa Barbara geographer David López-Carr in an email, “population is an underlying cause of all human-induced forest conversion. It is axiomatic: without people, there is no human driver of deforestation.”
What are the implications for policymakers and practitioners then? Efforts to protect biodiversity must be attuned to local context and take a holistic approach. For example, locally managed marine areas in Fiji halted the decline of marine species and boosted villagers' incomes by combining traditional resource management practices with modern scientific monitoring. And well-managed “ecotourism” can preserve biodiversity and reduce poverty, according to a study by Craig Leisher of The Nature Conservancy.
Protecting Biodiversity and Empowering Women in the DRC
The best policies, therefore, harness positive synergies among demographic, economic, and social factors. The Population-Health-Environment (PHE) Alliance Project, implemented by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) from 2008 to 2011 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a useful case study. The project combined women's empowerment, family planning, and basic health interventions with site-based conservation and livelihood efforts in the Monkoto Corridor, which borders Salonga National Park.
Salonga is a critical habitat for a number of endemic and endangered species, including the bonobo, humans' closest primate relative. The Monkoto corridor separates two halves of the park and serves as a vital pathway for wildlife. It is also home to a population of more than 100,000 people who must survive on the resources available in the corridor, not the park.
When the project began, rates of childhood vaccination in the Monkoto corridor were among the lowest in the country, while rates of malnutrition were among the highest, according to a WWF report. Because the area's people rely heavily on bush meat for food and income, and lack comparable alternative livelihoods, poaching poses a serious threat to wildlife in Salonga.
In response, WWF helped the Monkoto communities put in place legally binding land zoning plans and promote better land use management. The partners paid special attention to women farmers.
“Women are natural allies for conservation,” said Cara Honzak, a senior technical advisor to the Alliance Project, in an interview. Because women have an intense interest in sustaining natural resources to keep their children healthy, said Honzak, it is important to increase their capacity to make informed decisions about nutrition and involve them in land-use planning and governance.
The project made significant progress toward those ends. For example, it was able to dramatically increase women's participation in local committees charged with establishing land use plans. At the project's inception, there were only three women involved in that process; by 2011, women comprised 1,118 of the committees' 2,580 members.
WWF also provided women and their families with reproductive health services. At the start of the project, Monkoto's citizens had virtually no access to modern contraception. But a WWF survey found that 56 percent of Monkoto's women would use contraception if it were available. By 2011, the project consistently saw 300 new family planning users each month.
According to Honzak, this kind of integrated effort can serve as an example for conservation efforts around other at-risk ecosystems. It had a positive impact on the livelihoods of Mokoto's people, particularly women and children's health. And in turn, enabling women to choose the size of their families and the spacing of their births helps ensure a more sustainable growth rate and reduce direct pressure on surrounding habitats.
There is no single “magic bullet” to prevent species loss. But as Bremner said, in these frontier areas, “enabling women to achieve their reproductive desires has important benefits for them – and for biodiversity.”
This week, House Republicans finally unveiled their tax cut package after months of stating vague principles, squabbling over details, and even delaying its release by a day. Even though the plan offered more information than Republicans had been willing to cough up previously, many families still likely have very little idea of whether they'll be helped or hurt by the plan. That is, unless they're rich.
Even without a full expert markup, it's clear that low-income families get basically no relief at all in what Republicans propose. The rich, though, can rest assured that their tax bills would shrink if this grab bag were to become law.
Before the legislation was unveiled, Republicans and their critics had been trading volleys about whether their plan would keep the current system's basic progressivity: levying more taxes on the wealthy, and offering more relief to those further down the income ladder. President Donald Trump promised that his tax plan wouldn't help the rich “at all,” although Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin admitted that Republicans were finding it hard to not cut taxes for the well-off.
Much of the GOP's potential defense rested on how much they would expand the Child Tax Credit. The current credit, which is claimed by low- and middle-income parents, is worth up to $1,000 per child. But families who make less than $3,000 a year can't claim it at all, and those who do earn above that cutoff don't always get the full amount. Instead, families who make less than $16,330 get just a partial credit. All of this makes the CTC ripe for expansion and reform, an idea with support from people in both parties.
Should North Korea's nuclear antics compel us to launch a self-defense attack, success would require far more than pinpoint strikes. The choice would come down to this: Do we kill our enemies with sufficient ruthlessness at the outset, or do we attempt to minimize North Korean casualties and expose ourselves and our allies to the prospect of a drawn-out mutual butchery?
I fear we've forgotten what war means. That fear reached a peak a decade ago when American generals blithely repeated the indefensible claim that “counterinsurgency is warfare at the graduate-school level.” No. Counterinsurgency is Kindergarten (complete with political correctness nowadays). D-Day was a doctoral dissertation and the bombing campaign over Germany the preceding master's thesis.
For all of our spectacular technologies, I'm not convinced our leaders, civilian or military, are psychologically or morally prepared for a real war. We have taught our troops to break things, but to go to absurd lengths to spare all lives. Yet in warfare there's no substitute for killing your enemy and all those who support him. And you keep on killing until the enemy quits unconditionally or lies there dead and rotting.
So how would an effective campaign against North Korea unfold and what would it take?
The first step should begin immediately, well in advance and without firing a shot. All military family members, all Department of Defense civilian employees and all nonessential contractors should be evacuated from South Korea. Want to get North Korea's attention? That single act would serve as a graver warning of our readiness than any amount of sanctions or saber-rattling.
As a former soldier with plenty of time overseas, I'm well aware of the disruption to military families this would cause, but the purpose of our military is to fight — and an emergency evacuation later on would sap assets and clog facilities amid war's lethal confusion. Our men and women in combat need to concentrate on winning, not worrying about the safety of their loved ones.
Besides, frantic, last-minute evacuation efforts would tip off Pyongyang that a strike was imminent. Now, not later, is the right time to prepare for all contingencies — and to signal that preparedness.
Initially, we'd launch a surprise air and naval campaign, with ground forces deployed only in defense of South Korea. Pyongyang's nuclear and missile-development facilities and arsenals wouldn't be in the initial target set. First, we'd have to overwhelm and destroy North Korea's air defenses, while simultaneously degrading Pyongyang's military command, control and communications to cripple any response.
Then, rapidly, we'd go for the missile and nuke infrastructure. And here's where we'd have to show our will to win. Wrecking bunkered sites isn't enough. Research, development and production facilities can be rebuilt.
We'd need to strike, without warning, the dormitory facilities and housing areas for the scientists, designers, technicians, skilled workers and military cadres involved in North Korea's nuclear-weapons and missile programs. If we're unwilling to do that, we'd merely be buying ourselves a minor delay at extravagant cost.
And then we need to be prepared to counter any North Korean conventional blows against South Korea. Although we cannot forewarn China, we should, as the first missiles strike, tell Beijing to contact its interlocutors in Pyongyang and let them know that any attack on Seoul or across the DMZ will result in the devastation of North Korea's military and a painful form of regime change.
Then we need to live up to every word.
Of course, an attack should be a last resort. Even a very successful campaign would be high-risk and bloody. But we cannot allow the regime of Kim Jong-un to possess the means of nuclear blackmail or the ability to launch attacks against us.
The fundamental reason we have a government isn't to process Social Security payments. It's to defend our citizenry and our territory. Everything else is an add-on.
Meanwhile, our officials at all levels should avoid bellicose threats that only make us seem equally dubious in the eyes of the world. Let North Korea go on rhetorical rampages and further discredit itself. We should speak through our actions — such as those family evacuations, further anti-missile-system deployments, increased regional presence and, not least, deepening alliances.
Oh, and if North Korea's nuclear program has tunneled so far underground that conventional weapons can't destroy the infrastructure, use nukes. It may be time to remind the world just how terrible such weapons can be.
Iran would get the message.

Pope Francis has said he wants "a poor Church, for the poor" following his election as head of the world's 1.2bn Catholics on Wednesday.
He said he chose the name Francis after 12-13th Century St Francis of Assisi, who represented "poverty and peace".
He urged journalists to get to know the Church with its "virtues and sins" and to share its focus on "truth, goodness and beauty".
Pope Francis takes over from Benedict XVI, who abdicated last month.
The former Argentine cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, 76, was the surprise choice of cardinals meeting in Rome to choose a new head of the Church.
Analysis Divulging details of the conclave is punishable by excommunication. Only the Pope can release his electors from the vow of secrecy. Which is a good thing, because speaking in fluent Italian - and often off the cuff - to journalists in a packed Paul VI Hall, Pope Francis told of the moment he was elected. When he passed the crucial two-thirds threshold, his close friend, the Brazilian Cardinal Claudio Hummes hugged him, kissed him and entreated: "Don't forget the poor!" "And that word went in here," said the new Pope, pointing to his head. It's widely thought that each cardinal has a name up their sleeve before the election, just in case, but the 76-year-old Argentine suggested his choice was spontaneous. The son of an aristocrat, St Francis of Assisi spurned a life of luxury to live with and for the poor. The new Pope, the son of an Italian railway worker, said how he was inspired by the 13th Century Italian saint who was a man of both poverty and peace. "How I wish the Church could become poor again," he said.
In his first audience at the Vatican, he said Jesus Christ and not the Pope was the centre of the Church, which he stressed was "spiritual not political" in nature.
He said the Holy Spirit had inspired the resignation of Benedict XVI and guided the cardinals choosing him as the next pontiff.
The Pope said he had been inspired to take the name Francis by a Brazilian colleague who embraced him and whispered "don't forget the poor" when it was announced that he had been elected Pope.
He said he immediately thought of St Francis of Assisi, the Italian founder of the Franciscan Order who was devoted to the poor.
As well as representing poverty and peace, he said St Francis "loved and looked after" creation - and he noted that humanity was "not having a good relationship with nature at the moment".
St Francis of Assisi is said to have loved animals as his "brothers and sisters" and even to have preached to birds.
Humour
There had been speculation that Pope Francis - who was a member of the Jesuit order - had chosen his name in honour of St Francis Xavier, a 16th Century Jesuit missionary in Asia. But he said this was not the case.
The new Pope's style is very different to that of his predecessor, BBC Vatican correspondent David Willey says.
He talks in simple, easy to understand terms about ethical values and shows a remarkable sense of humour, our correspondent says.
Earlier, the Vatican said Pope Francis would visit his predecessor Pope emeritus Benedict next week.
Pope Benedict, 85, became the first Pope in 600 years to abdicate last month when he said old age and health meant he could no longer continue in the job.
Tips for Fuel-Efficient Driving
Avoid Aggressive Driving
“Jack-rabbit” starts and hard braking can increase fuel consumption by as much as 40%. Tests show that “jackrabbit” starts and hard braking reduces travel time by only four percent, while toxic emissions were more than five times higher. The proper way is to accelerate slowly and smoothly, then get into high gear as quickly as possible. In city driving, nearly 50% of the energy needed to power your car goes to acceleration.
Deceleration also affects fuel efficiency. Instead of breaking to stop your car, anticipate traffic flow as much as possible and coast to decelerate. In fuel-injection vehicles, removing your foot from the accelerator automatically stops the flow of fuel to the engine until the engine speed drops to idle—when it starts again to ensure your car doesn't stall. Coasting to decelerate also saves wear and tear on your brakes.
Drive Steadily at Posted Speed Limits
Maintaining a steady speed helps your engine perform efficiently. In one study conducted in Japan, small variations in speed were shown to increase fuel consumption by as much as 20-48%. Instead of allowing small dips in speed followed by bursts of acceleration, maintain a steady speed. When traveling in hilly terrain and where traffic permits, allow your car to slow down naturally when traveling uphill and to speed up again when going downhill.
Avoid Speeding
Increasing your highway cruising speed from 55mph (90km/h) to 75mph (120km/h) can raise fuel consumption as much as 20%. You can improve your gas mileage 10 – 15% by driving at 55mph rather than 65mph (104km/h). Natural Resources Canada puts the “sweet spot” for most cars, trucks, and SUVs even lower, between 30 mph (50 km/h) and 50 mph (80 km/h).
Note how quickly efficiency drops after 60 mph.
Exciting Vancouver news! Mayor Robertson has put forth a motion for city council to vote on next week which is chock full of amazing words, and which passed, will direct the city to have a bias towards openness — open source software, open standards, and open data.
That's pretty impressive! If the motion passes (which it should, riding on a global wave of sentiment towards openness, and fitting in with the platform that got seven of the councilors elected), this could mean great things for Vancouver, especially at the intersection of software, business, and the public.
On the issue of open source, I would love to show that local governments are able to recognize the strategic and control advantages inherent in software that they can influence and modify, and help push back the fear-driven campaigns which bias towards monopolies at taxpayer expense. Similarly, promoting the use of open standards is a no-brainer that the best technocrats realize can give them the power that befits them as customers. These ideas have been well articulated globally over the last few years, and I would hope that all high-level government staff and officials are briefed on the topics by now. (If any local officials want to discuss this in greater detail, there are many qualified experts in Vancouver, don't be afraid to ask for names or opinions!).
Open data is a more recent concept, the implications of which are likely as important as the rise of the web. With open data, governments have a unique opportunity to create economic growth, reduce operating costs, and enrich the life of their constituencies, simply by making a policy decision such as the one in tuesday's motion, and following through.
As Sir Tim Berners-Lee (the creator of the web) discusses in this 15-minute TED talk, the simple act of releasing public data enables others to create value. Of course, as the motion indicates, personal privacy rights trump, and we don't want to release data on individual citizens — luckily that's not needed in order to enable value creation. As an example, this impressive screencast of Wolfram Alpha demonstrates the power of new computational platforms leveraging public data. Vancouver's data belongs there.
Most government data is public data by definition. What's compelling about open data in the age of the web isn't the fact that citizens have access to such data — they typically have the legal right to obtain it through administrative requests, even though those are inconvenient (and very expensive for the city). What's compelling is that by making what belongs to the public available via the web, the city can accomplish many laudable goals at once:
In many cases, simply enabling self-service on the web will reduce costs for the city and provide better service to its citizens.
By making data that it doesn't have time to process and analyze available, the city allows others with time and expertise to do such analysis with no cost to the city. This will sound unbelievable to bureaucrats unused to open source, but this kind of thing really happens. You can't predict who will do what with what data, but you can be sure that it can't happen unless and until the data is available.
Some of those activities will just be interesting. But some will create new businesses, or allow existing businesses to become more efficient. What if local retailers could access demographic trend data for free on the web, today? What if companies outside of Vancouver could get a deeper understanding of Vancouver simply by looking at the data? Everyone knows that Vancouver is a great place to live. The city's economic strengths are not as well advertised. Enabling an ecosystem of people who turn data into interesting, insightful, and useful applications and sites can only help. Think of open data as the infrastructure of a chamber of commerce 2.0.
The city is there to serve the citizenry. To the extent that it is the caretaker of public data, and that the public has good ideas for using it, its job should be to get out of the way. Part of being a transparent government is to be invisible — to not get in the way of experimentation and innovation. Promoting open data while preserving privacy feels like a great goal for the city's IT staff.
There are also intangible benefits that come from these kinds of attitudinal shifts in how the city relates to the internet and the software economy. From a recruitment point of view in the software industry in particular, a city which embraced openness and the internet would be that much more attractive to the kinds of technical, creative, and public-spirited individuals that I seek.
Finally, local technology leaders are that much more likely to engage with the city and provide their help. I know that the notion of an “Open Vancouver” makes me much more keen to engage with the city, as it would put the city on the short but growing list of governments who understand how they can leverage the web and openness to improve life for their constituencies.
Police Suspend Investigation Of U.Va. Rape Claims Made In 'Rolling Stone'
Enlarge this image toggle caption Steve Helber/AP Steve Helber/AP
Update at 2:25 p.m. ET. Investigation Suspended:
The police department in Charlottesville, Va., says it has suspended its investigation into allegations of a brutal gang rape at the University of Virginia in 2012.
The allegations came to national prominence after Rolling Stone published a cover story on the case.
Police Chief Timothy Longo said that after trying to track down witnesses and a central figure in the alleged attack, they were unable to corroborate the student's story.
"We were unable to find a statement of fact that there was even an event" at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house where the alleged attack was said to take place, Longo said.
"This doesn't mean that something terrible did not happen to [the alleged victim known as] 'Jackie,' " Longo said. "We were just not able to conclude that anything happened."
That's why the police department is leaving the case open.
"I can't prove that something didn't happen," Longo said. "Someone else in the future may come forward" with information that may change the course of the investigation.
Rolling Stone has ordered an investigation into its reporting.
Our Original Post Continues:
Police in Charlottesville, Va., say they will announce the findings of an investigation into the alleged rape of a University of Virginia student that was reported last year in a controversial Rolling Stone magazine article.
In a statement on its website, the Charlottesville Police Department said it will not answer questions prior to a news conference scheduled for 2 p.m. ET today.
The development comes amid reports that Rolling Stone will publish an outside review of its reporting that resulted in the flawed story about the University of Virginia student who said she was gang-raped during a fraternity party in 2012. The review is being conducted by Steve Coll, dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.
"Steve Coll has not filed yet, but I expect the report soon and the plan is to publish in the next couple of weeks," Will Dana, Rolling Stone managing editor, told The New York Times.
As we previously reported:
"The Rolling Stone's story, titled A Rape on Campus, centered on allegations by a woman identified only as "Jackie." The magazine honored her request not to contact either the man she said raped her or the others who took part. Earlier this month, Rolling Stone said its trust in "Jackie" was "misplaced." It later changed its wording to say that it was "mistaken in honoring Jackie's request to not contact the alleged assaulters to get their account." "The admission came after other news organizations retraced its reporting and found discrepancies in Rolling Stone's story."
The magazine article prompted outrage and spurred University of Virginia President Teresa Sullivan to suspend all of the school's fraternities; those bans have since been lifted.
Three Afghan policemen have been killed and several coalition troops wounded in a Taliban attack against a government official's office in eastern Afghanistan's Paktia province, officials said.
"A suicide bomber blew up an explosives-laden vehicle at the gate of Chamkani district headquarters and then a group of militants, probably suicide attackers, tried to enter," said deputy provincial governor Abdul Rahman Mangal on Thursday.
"The first attacker managed to explode an explosive-laden vehicle. Three other would-be suicide bombers were killed by police before they managed to detonate their bombs." - Al Jazeera's Bernard Smith
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in a text message sent to journalists shortly after the initial explosion.
Master Sergeant Nick Conner, a spokesman for International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in eastern Afghanistan, confirmed the attack and said that coalition forces responded to Taliban fighters on the ground alongside Afghan forces.
"Three coalition forces wounded along with two Afghan uniformed police," he said. "Our initial reports were that they were wounded during the initial attack."
Al Jazeera's Bernard Smith, reporting from Kabul, said that there were four suicide bombers in total. All were killed in the attack.
"The first attacker managed to explode an explosive-laden vehicle. Three other would-be suicide bombers were killed by police before they managed to detonate their bombs," Smith said.
'Legitimate target'
Rohullah Samoon, provincial spokesman of Paktia, said that Thursday's attack targeted a meeting between the district governor and local elders discussing a loya jirga, or traditional meeting, to be held in Kabul on November 16.
"There was a meeting between the district chief and a group of elders selected to participate in the loya jirga going on in the governor's office at the time of the attack," said Samoon.
The loya jirga, called by President Hamid Karzai, will discuss a strategy for trying to make peace with the Taliban and Afghanistan's long-term relationship with the United States.
However, the Taliban is opposed to the meeting.
"The Taliban has said that anybody who attends the jirga here in Kabul is a legitimate target and can legitimately be killed," explained our correspondent.
The Taliban were ousted from power in 2001 by a US-led invasion in the wake of the September 11 attacks in the United States.
There are around 140,000 international troops in Afghanistan helping pro-government forces fight the Taliban.
All foreign combat troops are due to leave by the end of 2014, but a sizeable troop mission to train and mentor Afghan forces is set to remain beyond that date.
[Update at 10:24 p.m. ET: TSA Spokesperson Bruce Anderson told The Intercept Wednesday night that a third air marshal was involved. “Two of the employees involved have been placed on an indefinite suspension without pay, and the third employee has resigned from the agency,” he wrote in an e-mail.]
Two federal air marshals have been suspended without pay after allegedly using their government phones to film and share their sex acts with a prostitute while on assignment in Europe, The Intercept has learned.
Four employees based in different locations and divisions within the Transportation Security Administration told The Intercept that supervisors throughout the Federal Air Marshal Service and its parent agency, TSA, were casually briefing staff about the incident on Wednesday in anticipation of the news becoming public. None of these employees were authorized to speak to the media because the investigation by TSA's Office of Inspections and Office of Professional Responsibility is ongoing, and a criminal investigation is considered likely.
Congressional sources confirmed that an incident involving two air marshals who filmed sex acts on a government phone is expected to be raised during a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing on personnel failures within the Federal Air Marshal Service scheduled for Thursday afternoon.
The two air marshals, based in Chicago, allegedly used their government-issued phones to record their own sexual encounters with a prostitute and then shared them using their personal email accounts, which they had connected to their work phones, according to TSA, government and law enforcement sources.
On Wednesday afternoon, government sources close to the investigation confirmed that both air marshals had been suspended without pay while the investigation continues.
“TSA demands the highest standards of integrity and professionalism from its employees. When criminal behavior or misconduct is substantiated, TSA holds its employees appropriately accountable,” said TSA spokesman Mike England.
“This is an ongoing investigation and it would not be appropriate to discuss the specifics of these allegations.”
The Federal Air Marshal Service and the Transportation and Security Administration have been the subject of repeated embarrassing security and personnel failures.
On Thursday, Federal Air Marshal Service director Roderick Allison and the head of TSA's Office of Professional Responsibility, Heather Book, will testify before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform at a hearing expected to focus on these failures.
According to the committee's website the purpose of the 2 p.m. hearing Thursday is:
To examine personnel actions taken at the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) to address improper behavior, as well as managerial decisions to prevent further misconduct.
Those improper behaviors are also expected to include a scheme that was run out of TSA's Mission Operations Center that involved some air marshals agreeing to have sex with someone in charge of scheduling missions in order to get placed on flights to destinations of their choosing.
The Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee is separately investigating other aspects of the Federal Air Marshals Service.

In a few months, California will begin providing full Medi-Cal coverage to all low-income children -- regardless of their immigration status.
Depending on whom you ask, anywhere from 170,000 to 250,000 children who live in California and are in the country illegally will qualify.
If you think your child will, or know a parent whose child will, state officials and health care advocates have a simple message for you: Take action now. "Sign up today," says Rachel Vizcarra, a program assistant with the UFW Foundation in Bakersfield, which is helping families pre-enroll. "If you do, your kids will be automatically enrolled into the program."
State officials expect coverage to start May 16. But because the policy shift requires complex programming changes to state and county computer systems, implementation may be delayed, says Tony Cava of the state Department of Health Care Services.
No matter when it occurs, eligible children will gain coverage retroactive to the first day of that month, he says. For example, if the change takes place on May 16, coverage will extend back to May 1.
[Also: California bill delays moving thousands of children to Medi-Cal managed Medicaid plan]
Carolina Moran of Canoga Park looks forward to taking her 14-year-old daughter Lizeth to the doctor once she becomes eligible for full Medi-Cal benefits.
A concussion on the soccer field sent Lizeth to the emergency room in January, but she couldn't see a doctor for a follow-up visit because "we couldn't afford it. We would have to pay out of pocket," Moran says.
The first thing Moran will do is take Lizeth for a physical "and make sure her vaccinations are up to date," she says. "She also needs fillings for five cavities."
Medi-Cal eligibility is based on household income, and children under the age of 19 qualify at a higher income level than adults. They're eligible for Medi-Cal if the family's household income is less than 266 percent of the Federal Poverty Level, or about $53,600 for a family of three and $75,650 for a family of five.
Currently, children and adults in the country illegally qualify for limited Medi-Cal coverage, called restricted-scope, which covers emergency and pregnancy-related services.
Though this may sound counter-intuitive, health care advocates and the state want you to sign your kids up for restricted Medi-Cal now in preparation for the availability of full Medi-Cal benefits.
The idea is that when the change occurs, qualified children will automatically transition into full-scope Medi-Cal "within a few days" and without an additional application, Cava says.
[Also: Coalition calls for federal investigation of Medi-Cal reimbursement for alleged discrimination]
The state estimates that there are about 115,000 unauthorized immigrant children who already have restricted Medi-Cal.
If your child is uninsured, sign up for restricted-scope Medi-Cal now. Even if your child has coverage through another existing program -- such as Kaiser Permanente's Child Health Program or county-based health coverage -- you should still sign him/her up for restricted Medi-Cal now, says Mark Diel, CEO of California Coverage & Health Initiatives (CCHI), a statewide outreach and enrollment network.
That's because those kids will eventually become ineligible for those programs after they become eligible for full Medi-Cal, he says. (Don't drop out of another program until you confirm that your child's full-scope Medi-Cal has been approved, he says.)
But be warned: The Medi-Cal application is long and complicated. To complete it, you'll need to provide a birth certificate, proof of local address, proof of identity and income information, Vizcarra says. Foreign passports and birth certificates can be used.
"Work with a local enroller instead of trying to do it on your own," Diel says. "You're much more likely to get the application approved."
Help from local health clinics and community groups is free. Online, visit www.cchi4families.org/find-help for local resources.
[Also: Doctors refuse to treat poor Medi-Cal clients due to low reimbursement rate, advocacy group claims]
Advocates and state officials also want you to know that enrolling your kids shouldn't lead to negative immigration consequences for you -- or other members of your family -- who may not have legal status.
"None of the information being collected is shared with immigration authorities," says Maria Romero-Mora of CCHI.
Once you get your kids into restricted-scope Medi-Cal, and eventually into full Medi-Cal, you'll need to take action. Look for letters in the mail before and after the transition explaining your options.
CHOOSE A PLAN: Once the transition to full Medi-Cal occurs, you will have 60 days to choose a managed care health plan for children already enrolled in restricted-scope Medi-Cal. If you don't choose a plan, the state will assign one, Cava says.
Parents of kids who are not in restricted-scope Medi-Cal at the time of the change and who enroll them afterward will have 30 days to choose a plan, he says.
If you live in one of 22 counties where Medi-Cal managed care is operated by a single County Organized Health System, children will be automatically enrolled in that plan, Cava says.
In all cases, until a plan is chosen -- or assigned -- children will receive coverage through Medi-Cal's fee-for-service program.

PAY PREMIUMS: Medi-Cal is premium-free for kids up to 160 percent of the Federal Poverty Level, but you will owe a premium if your family income falls between 160 percent and 266 percent. The premium is $13 a month for each child, with a $39 family maximum.
Children in Medi-Cal plans don't have co-payments for medical care.
RENEW: You will need to participate in Medi-Cal's annual renewal process to ensure your children remain eligible and enrolled.
Finally, if you don't sign your child up for restricted Medi-Cal before the change, you can apply for full benefits afterward -- anytime of year -- at your county human services office, through a community organization or via theCovered California website, www.CoveredCA.com.
In Canoga Park, Moran says getting Lizeth on Medi-Cal will give her family greater financial security. Lizeth agrees.
"I worry that if I have to go to a checkup, it's going to cost my parents money, and sometimes they don't have the money to pay for it," the ninth-grader says.

I'm surprised how often I read online someone making the assertion that the Documentary Hypothesis is dead. “The JEPD theory is no longer dominant,” remarked one recent commentator, “now biblical scholars look towards community authorship or single authorship of the Pentateuch with supplementation.” I'm not sure where precisely this idea stems from, but it's certainly not correct. My concern is that it seems to be expressed most frequently by religious commentators seeking to defend a type of inspired unity to the work that can be traced back to Mosaic authorship, or if not that far, the death of the DH at least supports a more traditional religious reading of the work.
The DH traces its intellectual roots to the rise of 17th century European rationalism. European rationalism transformed the traditional approach of interpreting the Bible as privileged text. During this era, several European philosophers who considered reason to be the ultimate source for human knowledge began questioning many long-held assumptions regarding the Bible, including the concept of biblical inerrancy.
Rather than reading the Bible as a scriptural text that requires its own special rules to explain or cover-up inconsistencies, philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza, Thomas Hobbes, and Thomas Paine interpreted the text according to the standard rules of logic. For example, a slave law in Exodus 21:6 states that some slaves should serve their masters “forever.” This statement, however, directly contradicts the slave law in Leviticus 24:40, which states that all slaves must be released every fiftieth year (the year of Jubilee). Not wanting to see these laws as contradictions, later Jewish rabbis attempted to reconcile the two passages by stating that the word “forever” really means “practically, but not literally forever”—in other words, simply until the year of Jubilee.[1] In contrast to this approach, which had been adopted by Jewish and Christian interpreters alike, European rationalists began arguing that if a text like Exodus 21 said “forever,” it should be read as “forever,” and that the two laws were simply at odds with one another. In other words, they began to treat the Bible like a real book that could contain historical anachronisms and inconsistencies.[2] The Bible was not simply inerrant scripture that needed to be harmonized.
This new “enlightened” approach to reading the Bible produced a German school of interpretation in the theology departments of Protestant universities. The most influential member of this intellectual school was the German scholar Julius Wellhausen. In 1878, Wellhausen synthesized previous scholarly discoveries in Higher Criticism through the publication of his highly influential book Prolegomena to the History of Ancient Israel.[3] Ultimately, Wellhausen's work did for biblical scholarship what Darwin's Origin of the Species accomplished for natural science. As Darwin ' s concept of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection has become central to modern evolutionary theory, so Wellhausen's work on historical criticism provides the foundation for modern scholarly assessments of the Bible.
In order to take seriously the inconsistencies found throughout the Bible's first five books, Prolegomena broke up the Pentateuch into separate sources that Wellhausen dated to specific times in Israelite history. He then put those sources back together again according to his own theory regarding the evolution of Israelite religion. Though in the years that followed, not all of Wellhausen's interpretations of the development of biblical sources have been accepted, as of today almost all contemporary biblical scholars recognize that the first five books of the Bible were not written by a single author and that they are in fact a compilation of separate sources composed by different schools of thought.
When commentators speak of the “death of the DH,” they often draw this conclusion from criticism raised in recent years by European scholars. This new school of continental scholarship in part traces its origins to the work of Rolf Rendtorff, who raised important questions regarding the combination of tradition history and source criticism in the manner commonly assumed in critical Pentateuchal scholarship.[4] Rendtorff rejected the traditionally accepted premise of a Yahwistic author writing during the Israelite monarchal period. Similar arguments were then raised in the late 1980's and early 1990's by scholars such as Albert de Pury and Thomas Römer who likewise maintained that the original literary basis of the Pentateuch did not result from a Yahwistic source produced during the monarchy. Instead, de Pury and Römer suggested that the Pentateuch derived primarily from the writings of a Priestly author working in the post-exilic era.[5] In terms of European studies, these ideas have played a significant role in the development of various theories regarding the historical development of the first five books of the Hebrew Bible.[6]
In recent years, many continental scholars have abandoned the traditional theory of documentary sources in the Pentateuch as a relevant model for explaining its development, and in its place adopted a “Fragmentary” or “Supplementary” Hypothesis.[7] These theories have called into question many previously held assumptions by source critics, including the nature and even existence of sources such as J and E. Continental scholars have differed lately in their views of documentary sources and fragmentary supplements within the Pentateuch, especially in relationship to Genesis 1-11.[8] They have mostly done away with J, E, and to some extent, even P.[9]
This does not mean, however, that continental studies have entirely rejected the basic premise of separate sources within the Pentateuch. “The newer contributions to Pentateuchal research from Europe do not aim at overthrowing the Documentary Hypothesis,” writes Konrad Schmid, “rather, they strive to understand the composition of the Pentateuch in the most appropriate terms, which… includes ‘documentary' elements as well.”[10] Moreover, the documentary approach still has a strong following in North American and Israeli scholarship and new arguments have been put forward recently reaffirming its validity (Baden, Schwartz, Stackert, Hendel, and Friedman, among others).[11]
The truth is that the DH is far from dead. While there have been some important criticisms of the traditional DH presented in recent years, even European critics have not entirely abandoned the idea that the Pentateuch is a compilation of “documents.” P, for example, is now almost universally recognized as an independent source as is D. Hence, what we call these sources (for example, P, J, E, and D) really doesn't matter. There will always be some differences in the way scholars divide them up (documents versus fragments, etc.).
To share my own feelings, rather than supplementary fragments, I'm convinced that J and E were also independent narratives. My view is based upon the fact that when these narratives are extracted from P, there is a readability factor that consistently ties the sources thematically and linguistically together as a unified whole. And, as biblical scholar William Propp has explained, the repetition of duplicative stories throughout the Pentateuch points towards separate, stand alone documents rather than supplemental insertions:
“Why must we be told twice of the corruption of the antediluvian earth (Gen. 6:5; 11-12)? Why should Noah be twice commanded to enter the ark (Gen. 6:18, 7:1), and why must he do so twice (Gen. 7:7,13)? Why must we be told twice that all life perished (Gen. 7:21, 22-23)? Why should Jacob twice receive the name Israel (Gen. 32:29, 35:10)? Why must Yahweh tell Moses twice that he has heard Israel's cry (Ex. 3:7, 6:5)? Do we need a new plague of kinnîm [‘nats'] (Ex. 7:12-15) before ‘ārōb [‘swarm'] (Ex. 7:15-28), given the apparent synonymity (see Ps. 105:31)? Why should the spies twice describe the giants of Canaan (Num. 13:28, 32-33)? Why are the Israelites twice condemned to die in the desert (Num. 14:23, 28-35)? A few redundancies might be attributed to different sensibilities on the part of the supplementer, a few inconsistencies to absence of mind. A wholesale pattern of redundancy and contradiction is another matter.”[12]

Denton's hydraulic fracturing ban was passed with great fanfare in November, but early Wednesday morning the City Council was forced to take it off the books because of a new state law and pending lawsuits.
The council voted 6-1 to repeal the ordinance because it had been rendered unenforceable by House Bill 40, a law signed by Gov. Greg Abbott last month that prohibited cities from adopting such bans.
The council said repealing the ban was “in the overall interest of the Denton taxpayers to strategically repeal the ordinance,” a statement said. “Doing so not only potentially reduces ongoing court costs and attorneys fees related to ongoing litigation” but it also “significantly mitigates problems and perceptions associated with operational discrepancies between the ban ordinance and newly-adopted state law.”
“Council members emphasize this decision was not taken lightly, and that the City Council is looking to the long-term interests of this city by balancing all concerns and concluding the litigation on the matter,” the statement said.

Repealing the ordinance came a day after the Texas Oil and Gas Association and the state's General Land office went back to court seeking to toss out the ban on hydraulic fracturing and a moratorium the city used to stop drilling while it reworked its overall gas drilling ordinance.
TXOGA and the land office sued Denton in November, the day after its citizens approved the ban on hydraulic fracturing. Their amended petitions filed Monday seek declaratory judgments tossing out the moratorium and the ban and an injunction preventing city officials from enforcing them.
Both amended lawsuits contend that HB 40, passed during the recent legislative session prohibit cities from halting development of natural gas reserves, even if only for a short time.
“Both the drilling moratorium and the hydraulic frac ban, which in effect completely prohibit the development of the Barnett Shale within the city of Denton, are unconstitutional because they are expressly pre-empted by HB40,” the TXOGA lawsuit states.
Denton has not been enforcing the ban. Earlier this month, Vantage Energy began fracking at a well site it operates northwest of downtown Denton. Eight protesters supporting the ban have been arrested at the site, including a 92-year-old mother and her son Tuesday.
The council put off repealing the ban two weeks ago even while admitting the ban is unenforceable.
On the agenda were two options — one to amend the ordinance regarding the ban but declare it unenforceable, and the other a new ordinance simply saying that it's unenforceable, said Lindsey Baker, a spokeswoman for the city. Repealing the ban was not on the agenda, but the council has the authority to repeal the ban if members want to, she said.
Eventually, the council chose to repeal the ordinance.
“HB 40 is the law now in the State of Texas. Denton will comply with it so long as it remains valid,” the council statement said.
Council was warned
Denton has been struggling to figure out what to do with its fracking ban, the first in Texas, since the passage of HB40, which limits the ability of cities to regulate the oil and gas industry.
HB40, also known as the Denton fracking bill and championed by the oil and gas industry, reasserts state control over the drilling process in Texas. The new law includes a four-part test for allowing cities to regulate drilling operations above ground, including issues such as emergency response, noise and setbacks. But the law says those controls must be “economically reasonable” and can't hinder the work of a “prudent operator.”
To provide some comfort to cities with long-standing ordinances, such as Fort Worth, the bill contains a “safe harbor” provision that says any ordinance or other measure in effect for five years that has allowed drilling should be considered economically reasonable.
City Attorney Anita Burgess warned the council two weeks ago that while the initial lawsuits filed by TXOGA did not take HB40 into account, they could be amended to include issues like setbacks, banning saltwater injection wells and blowout prevention measures.
Burgess also told the council that the ordinance's fracking ban was unenforceable and that the city was negotiating with industry and state attorneys about settling the lawsuits. TXOGA's petition filed Monday says the “parties remain in dispute” over the enforceability of the city's ordinances.
As of earlier this month, the city had spent about $219,600 defending the fracking ban in court. It had spent another $622,700 writing, developing and defending its overall gas well ordinance since 2009, far less than the $1 million the industry has said it spent since the ban was enacted.
But in their latest pleadings, TXOGA and the land office still make it clear that they believe what Denton has done does not comply with the law and they want the courts to put a stop to it.
“The drilling moratorium and the hydraulic frac ban … undermine Texas policy and invade the province of the agencies tasked with regulating this state's oil and gas resources,” documents state.
Tough to swallow
Municipal officials from across the state opposed HB40 for being too ambiguous and said it ultimately will face court challenges. But environmental and city attorneys have warned that Denton is not the best place to do so, given its checkered past in dealing with drilling.
They said a negative ruling in Denton could make it difficult for other cities to enforce their drilling ordinances.
Jim Bradbury, an environmental lawyer who helped write Fort Worth's drilling ordinance, said the new pleadings by TXOGA and the state are short of what he and others have been worried about: a challenge to the city's entire drilling ordinance, not just the ban.
He said Denton needs to get rid of the ban and be done with it.
“Why continue to give TXOGA a stick to beat you with?” Bradbury said.
But both Bradbury and Mansfield Public Safety Director Bill Lane said an argument can be made to defend a moratorium, which other cities have also used since urban drilling's early days.
Lane, who is an attorney, said as long as a moratorium is adopted to allow a city to study traffic or public safety — issues that HB40 allows cities to regulate — it can be done.
Denton imposed its moratorium in May 2014 before the fracking ban was approved by voters as it sought to update its ordinance. The city eventually extended the moratorium to August, and the council was set to discuss the overall ordinance again at its meeting Tuesday.
“Pandora's box has been opened,” Lane said. “Everyone is going to have to step back and figure out how to live with them.”
Lane said the new filings by TXOGA and the land office are a signal to Denton that they “mean business.”
“It's like that cheap steak in a steakhouse. You keep chewing and chewing and you can't get it swallowed. But that is where we are,” he said.
Today's guest article is by Gnome Stew reader Michael, a DM with approximately 35 years of experience with roleplaying games, administrator of a D&D 5th edition community page, and a regular writer at Tribality.com. Thanks, Michael! –Martin
The most crucial aspect of role playing is the story, but we waste a lot of time with administration of the game. And the most time consuming aspect of some role playing games is Role-playing.
I have been in some games where the dice are rolled at the end of almost every query made by a player; right after a player explains what his character is attempting he is asked to roll a die. It was very frustrating, and I could see the life force drain from the new player's face. Sometimes, we may find ourselves in that same scenario; where we are rolling the dice for everything that comes, because that's what the rules say. Or the GM believes that is how the game is played. Rolling the dice can be fun but we should start looking at ways to minimize dice rolls.
I am sure there are a lot of options for simply not using dice at all. You may have been on car trip, or even out camping with friends where you don't want to roll dice, but still want to play. There are a lot of RPGs that don't require any dice, and using some of those ideas, you could take a role playing game and minimize the amount of dice rolling. And then we can start maximizing the dialogue and NPC interaction and stop asking for the constant dice rolling.
Examples of Diceless Games
So I did a quick search and found this list on Wikipedia:
Active Exploits is free; world-books available: Sengoku: Chanbara, Dreamwalker, Blood Island Diceless, and CORPS Diceless
Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game uses no randomization, although secret information does create uncertainty for players
Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine by Jenna Moran is a slice-of-life game as well as an adventure game
Everway uses diceless mechanics, but also has elements of chance, if the game master wishes to utilize them
Frankenstein Atomic Frontier, an Australian role-playing game, uses cards with players drawing a quantity equal to their trait, counting Aces, Kings, Queens, Jacks and Jokers as a success
Golden Sky Stories, a Japanese heartwarming, non-violent role-playing game uses resource pools, called Wonder and Feelings, rather than dice
Lords of Gossamer and Shadow uses no randomization, but has Good Stuff and Bad Stuff to influence circumstances of chance
Lords of Olympus is inspired by Amber Diceless in which players take roles of Greek pantheon characters
Marvel Universe Roleplaying Game uses a resource-management system inspired by collectible card games
Microscope and Kingdom use diceless mechanics to create a setting
Montsegur 1244 is a game about the fall of Monstsegur Castle, held by the Cathars; the plot is pre-scripted and leads to the question which of the characters burn for heresy, and does one of them escape into the night
Nobilis
Theatrix
Troika Moira uses secrecy to replicated chance for most actions and a double-bluff system for combat, similar to rock, paper, scissors
There are some very creative resolution systems in these games, and I like a lot of the things I found. But with the traditional role playing games that I am playing, I just want to minimize the rolling of dice, not completely remove them. So with some ideas in mind I'll look at two areas of contention or game delay that I find in my role playing games: combat and skill checks.
Combat – The Odds are in Your Favor
Let us start by looking at what to do with encounters involving combat.
When it is highly likely that the players are going to win combat against some monsters, then the story should simply be fast forwarded to the end. That is so that the story can continue without a lot of meaningless dice rolls and mundane combat damage. The die rolling just becomes a lot of nickel & diming of the player character's health points, and the combat die rolling becomes totally unnecessary and boring.
Nothing kills the game more than 10 rounds of dice rolling to kill the small group of goblins because the party isn't rolling well. The combat encounter should just be finished when there are six players fighting that last couple of goblins. Ask the players, “Do you to kill them, or do you want them captured?” They let you know, and their decision is the story. This will save a ton of time, and reduce the dice rolling. The game master should really save all those nail biting dice rolls for the Big Boss Fight.
Combat – Rolling Dice for Damage
So with combat, there are other options when rolling randomly for damage. The fastest for monsters and NPCs is to take the average damage a creature can output and just call it that and be done. If the damage is a 1d6 of damage, then make the damage equal to 3. If you are rolling 2d12+5, then make the damage 17 (6+6+5).
Another option is if you are rolling a die to see if a monster or player hits, then you would scale the damage based on the roll:
The creature that rolls a d20 to hit and needs a 14 to hit. On a hit does 2d6+2.
The creature then would do minimum damage if it rolled a 14 so that would be 3 damage.
If the player rolled a 20 on the d20, then give the damage as a maximum, for 14 damage.
Everything in between is divvied out as average damage for 8 damage.
Skill checks
Now, the players will at times make choices that can be attributed to one of their PCs' skills with a d20 mechanic or another dice rolling mechanic, then an average die roll is taken vice an actual die roll. So for the 20 sided dice that would be 10 plus the skill or attribute score. If you use 2d6, then that average would be a 7. This type of game mechanic addition makes things very clean, nice and simple. This is sometimes referred to a passive attribute, take 10, or inherent ability.
Another way to reduce unnecessary dice rolling is to roll only once for a skill check until the circumstances change dramatically. So the thief is trying to sneak through the castle rolls once against the first castle guard, and succeeds. Then you don't need to keep rolling skill check dice throughout the castle, the thief would just keep going through the castle. Makes things simpler and can fast forward the story to a nice narrative point.
But I like Dice!
I'm not advocating that you should remove all the die rolls, and just replace them with the game master's fiat, unless everyone is really on board with that. There are systems that remove the dice, and I listed a lot of them above. If you're not careful, then those type of games can devolve into “the GM's story” and the players are just spectators instead of active, creative participants. If the player characters are to be the protagonists of this shared story, then the players need their choices to matter. Often, the dice rolls are the main point of contact with the system for players, and removing them removes a vital tool for player agency and are an impartial judge. Even a random factor can be a lot better pill to swallow than the GM saying no.
In Conclusion
I would say all of the decisions really depend on what you want from the game. I actually do like the crazy “random factor” that the dice create. Sometimes dice come up with results that are not expected for the game master or other players in the game. But I think it's good for the GM to know when to roll the dice and when not to. If you really want someone to climb over the castle wall, because the adventure lies beyond the castle wall, having them make a roll that can result in them not getting to the adventure may not be a good idea. A bad dice roll can stall or even ruin a game.
Build the story up with all the players and have fun. The dice are a fun tool, but don't let the dice dictate how you have fun with your friends.
Thanks for reading, and have fun!
Weekly Journal - Surprise Update!
Hey everyone,
In our schedule we had planned to release the September update next week but it is stable too enough to be released today, so, surprise!
The update is currently on the main branch of Steam, and on GOG. We have submitted the update to Microsoft as well and it should be up in the next few days on Xbox One. You can read the patch notes here!
Keep in mind that you should start a fresh new game after every update or it will create a lot of random issues. This isn't ideal but it is temporary, at least until we can finish working on the compatibility system.

I decided it was crucial to spend two weeks walking around London and eating meat pies in pubs.
Also, to spend a night in a hotel inside the Avebury stone circle. And visit the White Horse of Uffington. And the chalk cliffs of Eastbourne. I'm bringing back a slew of reference pictures for Whitney and the art boys, so some of these may wind up one way or another in the game. I've also got some ideas for more things Bobbies can say to each other. Very hard, painstaking work, you understand. There's nothing we won't do for authenticity.
For some reason all this is considered “vacation,” so don't worry, your Kickstarter/Early Access dollars did not pay for it…

Hello everyone! This week with the design team we started learning the new quest system that the programmers have been working on. We are going to use this to handle all of the game's quests. We are going to be spending a fair bit of time transfering all of our encounters to this new system in the coming weeks, but it will be worth it as it will greatly reduce quest progression bugs and it will take us less scripting and debug time so we can really focus on making more quests and build a bigger and better Wellington Wells for you to explore. So, nothing really exciting to show this week, but everyone will be glad that we took the time to do this in the long run. Stay tuned!
Mike
Hey! This week I mostly worked on “porting” the script work we have to the new quest system the programmers have created. This is gonna fix a bunch of bugs, and accelerate Level Designer's workflow at the same time - So we spend less time dealing with issues and more time building cool stuff! New underground level:
I also added some new decorators (things that allow for variation in how the street looks, eg signs or flowers) that can spawn on the street, and started to integrate Marc-André's archways structures:
See you next week!

Ahoy! I'm back after a pretty long vacation. All ready to start the sprint toward release with all the Compulsion fellas!
I'm starting right away on some secret storyboarding for some crucial scenes in Arthur's playthrough. That kind of scene is pretty important to plan in advance, and storyboarding is a really nice tool to support discussion, as it helps us to agree on the direction we want to take the scene!
PS: While away, I had us covered for marketing in the prairies.

We are currently working on upgrading and developing more Village homes, so this week I continued researching British 60's kitchen furniture and interior color schemes and layouts. I also did some research on how to approach some of our cinematic locations, including our major final location. Here is the design for the Wellington Wells "Compliment Machine" - a robot designed to make you feel great about yourself by lavishing you with compliments.
Marc-André
At the beginning of this week, I completed the new medieval arches for the Village. These will allow us to break up the visual space and add variation to the world. I've had some help from Mike to get them to spawn in the Village islands. After that, to replace some of the game's oldest props, I've been creating a new complete high-quality kitchen furniture set for the Village. New furniture ranges from cabinets and shelves to a sink, oven and fridge. This new set is very flexible. It has been created in a modular fashion and can have its colours easily altered to match multiple color palettes. When the player interacts with furniture to gather loot, drawers will visually open to give additional visual feedback. As always, the set is optimized both in polygons and in texture memory. When creating sets like this, multiple steps are involved.
Reference/Concept: First, I was given references to work from (pictures of actual kitchen furniture in the style we want). As with always, it is important to use these as inspiration and alter them to avoid carbon-copying them. Copyright is important and we therefore can't use existing furniture exactly as-is. Planning: The second step was to determine which dimensions I wanted to use for the modular system. In this case, it was quite easy because I was instructed to match the new set with the dimensions of the old one. Modules range from 50 centimeters to 1 meter, which translate to 50 and 100 Unreal units. That way, modules can be effortlessly snapped inside of houses next to each other. Modelling: After I know exactly what I need to do, I progress to the modelling stage. This is where I sculpt the various furniture inside of Autodesk Maya LT. I concentrate on shape, size and form.
4
4. Baking preparation: After the modelling is done, I start to optimize the meshes and prepare them for texture baking of the normal map (gives illusion of high detail on a low-polygon model) and ambient occlusion (surfaces that are near together appear darker, accentuating relief). I separate the different objects I am creating, remove duplicate areas (ex. clones of the same cabinet door) and create new meshes that are going to tell the computer later on what areas are to block light/create occlusion. These are walls and cabinet doors. To help me visually differentiate these block-light meshes, I set them to a red color.
5. Geometry optimisation: Now, the models' geometries needs to be optimized. There is a very high amount of polygons on the models I created earlier. I keep a copy of the existing high poly version in another folder; we'll need it later on. I try to keep as much of the original shape as possible while greatly reducing the amount of polygons. Now that I'm done, I went from 73414 polygon triangles to 14227 polygon triangles – not bad! However, some very important details have been lost. We will recuperate them later.
6. After geometry has been optimized, I map the UV space by flattening the meshes onto a 2D plane (much like unfolding an origami into a flat sheet of paper). This will allow me to apply textures correctly to the 3D models.
Next week: texturing!
Thanks for tuning in!

My adventures in Rust webdev
tomaka Blocked Unblock Follow Sep 22, 2016
People who know me in the Rust community usually think that I'm a game developer, since I contribute mostly to game development libraries in Rust. What they probably don't know is that in real life I'm doing backend web development for a living, while gamedev is only my dream job.
One of the services I'm in charge of is an internal service that was written in node+express in their early years (for various reasons that are off-topic here). As it is private it is running on a single server and doesn't get a lot of traffic. Over time, because of several large changes in the requirements, the code has started being crippled with quirks and bugs. Around mid-2015, I started rewriting it in Rust.
I pushed the rewrite in production around the end of 2015, and am now in the process of rewriting another similar code in Rust. Here is a short “post-mortem” of what worked/works well and what was/is troublesome.
The framework
The most popular Rust web frameworks today are Iron and Nickel, but there exist several other personal web frameworks with a few github stars each. As far as I can tell, all the frameworks that I found in my quick overview are express-like middlewares-based frameworks.
While the advantage of using middlewares is that people coming from dynamic languages are going to be more or less familiar with them, I think that this is really an unidiomatic design in Rust. You have to put things in static objects that are referred by their name and handle lifetime issues, while in my opinion it's not better than simply using regular variables.
For this reason I decided to write my own framework named rouille, which I'm very satisfied of. I don't want to enter “the frameworks game” because I try to focus my open source contributions on gamedev, but I would definitely recommend people to use rouille's simple “flat” design compared to middlewares.
Templates
Since the old website was using HTML templates written in mustache, I decided to keep that system and use the mustache Rust library.
There's nothing to say on the Rust library itself, it works great, but there are things to say about how to use it and mustache itself.
Caching
First of all, I had the idea to use a caching mechanism for the templates. The first time I use a template, it would compile it and store it in memory. Then when you reuse the same template, it would load the already-compiled template from the cache. The cache itself was stored in a lazy_static!.
This seemed like a good idea but I quickly realized that it's a nightmare for development, as I had to restart the server every time I made a change to a template. This is especially annoying because for an undetermined reason the server remains inaccessible for about ten seconds after it is supposed to have started listening.
Another problem of that caching system is that if building a template would panic (because the template is malformed), the mutex that locks the cache would become poisoned. All the routes of the server that use any template would then automatically panic as well because of that. This problem was easily bypassed by rewriting some parts of the code in a cleverer way, but it's definitely a problem that I wasn't expecting.
I ended up removing this caching mechanism entirely. It would be nice to enable it when compiling in release mode and disable it in debug mode, but there's apparently no clean way in Rust to do that.
Usability
Just like the middlewares system that I talked about earlier, the mustache templating system was designed for weakly-typed languages. For example when you write {{#foo}}, the value of foo passed from Rust can be an Option, a struct, a Vec, a boolean, a function, and so on.
Contrary to node for example where you would just pass { foo: bar } to the template engine, in Rust you have to manually create a struct that contains the foo member with its type, and then instantiate that struct. Several hundred lines of my code are dedicated purely to struct definitions that would be unnecessary in a weakly-typed language. That doesn't mean that weak typing is better for templating, it just means that mustache is not really adapted to Rust.
Usually the major selling point of strong typing is that it provides better guarantees. But in the case of mustache, you don't get any compilation error if you make a typo in an identifier or in the template. I usually tell people that the advantage of Rust is that your code will just work almost all the time once you managed to compile it, but with mustache it is clearly not the case with typos not even being detected.
This area of Rust web development could definitely get some improvements. As an experiment I quickly wrote a small library that compiles templates at compile-time and generate Rust structs at compile-time, but I found out that in some situations it is also very unpractical. It could be an area that could be investigated more.
Postgres
I'm using the postgres library in order to connect to the database. It works great, if you except… OpenSSL.
OpenSSL
Everyone who has tried web development in Rust for some time probably knows what I mean. This library is a nightmare. It is for example the reason why I'm using a Linux virtual machine to develop on my Windows machine, instead of compiling for Windows directly.
Outside of linking issues, the biggest problem is the fact that there are multiple versions of openssl-sys, and they all share the same links attribute used by Cargo to determine whether two libraries can be used at the same time.
This means that for example if you want to use at the same time postgres 0.9 (which indirectly depends on openssl-sys 0.6) and curl 0.3 (which depends on openssl-sys 0.7), you will get a compilation error from Cargo because openssl-sys 0.6 and 0.7 can't be used at the same time.
This problem hit me three times in total, forcing me to update all my dependencies. One of these updates took me one and a half hours, just because of that “administrative” and non-technical problem.
While writing this article I discovered that recent versions of postgres accept multiple versions of openssl, which is a good thing. However I feel like it's still an unresolved problem and that the design of the links attribute needs a change.
Postgres‘s usability
The postgres library itself can be a little tedious to use. I started the project by writing code that would manually read columns from result sets. This makes the code really tedious to write and difficult to read.
Therefore in order to make my life easier, I wrote some macros which you can find here. I strongly encourage you to use these, or to write similar macros. The only operation that doesn't have a macro is executing a query that doesn't return anything (such as an UPDATE), for which I just call execute.
Despite these macros, everything I said about mustache's usability also applies to SQL queries. It would be so much nicer to check the SQL code's validity or even the data types at compile-time in order to avoid risking an error 500 if you make a mistake and forgot to write a test for something. Again, procedural macros could come to our rescue.
Chrono
One thing I didn't mention is that the code manipulates a lot of dates and hours. It is in fact from this area that most of the bugs in the old code came from, as handling date/times in Javascript is a total clusterfuck.
I just want to say that the chrono crate is absolutely pure happiness compared to Javascript. Just for this alone, I think it was worth rewriting in Rust.
Deployment
Every popular language has its utilities and tutorials about how to properly deploy a web service written in that language. But Rust doesn't.
Right now my design is very archaic. Whenever I want to deploy an update, I have to connect with SSH to the production server and run a shell script. This script pulls the latest version of the code from a git repository, then builds in release mode the library part of the package (which takes a good five minutes, as the server is not very powerful), then stops the current daemon, builds the main executable in release mode (which takes a few seconds), then starts that executable as a daemon.
This downtime of a few seconds is okay-ish because it is an internal utility, and because I try to deploy updates outside of work hours. But I would not want to do that for a site getting public traffic.
The fact that the production server builds the Rust executable also caused a problem which I hadn't anticipated: the compilation process uses almost all the memory (1 GB) of the server. Recently I actually hit that limit, and the OOM killer of the server silently killed the MySQL daemon that was running on it. Not cool, and stressful when I got emailed about everything being broken ten minutes later. I really wouldn't want that to happen on a “real” production server with thousands of clients.
After this event, I tried the solution of building the main executable during the continuous integration and sending it to the production server. In addition to the increased security risk of executing something sent over the Internet without any check, I encountered a problem which is that the built executable couldn't find OpenSSL's shared libraries on the production server (yes, OpenSSL again). I abandoned this idea.
Right now my idea is to build a small executable that would act as an HTTP proxy around the real website. Whenever an HTTP request is made to a special route, the proxy would invoke git to pull the latest version then Cargo to compile the real website. This would solve the downtime problem and would make the deployments automatic, but it wouldn't solve the out-of-memory error. I haven't written that code yet, but will probably do so in the next few weeks.
Overall
Overall I'm quite satisfied of Rust. I still wouldn't recommend web development in Rust for everyone, unless it's really worth it or if you like to figure out things yourself. But it's (very) slowly getting there.
The server didn't crash once since I have started it for the first time nine months ago, which is very satisfying. I got approximately half a dozen different panics (that are caught and translated into error 500s), all of them trying to read a NULL value from the database in a non-Option variable.
In fact the biggest worry I still have about Rust is the fact that it's a niche technology for webdev (note: I wouldn't consider Rust niche anymore for system programming, but it is very niche for webdev). I was lucky enough to be able to choose the language I want for this project, but if I ever leave this client it will be hard for them to make deep changes to the code. But if everybody made the same reasoning, nothing would ever get started.
Special teams production was an issue for the Cincinnati Bengals in 2016. Aside from Alex Erickson leading the AFC in kick return average during the course of the season, the unit as a whole looked both weak and inconsistent. The worst offender was kicker Mike Nugent, who was eventually cut after Week 14. But veteran punter, Kevin Huber, who averaged the lowest hang time among all NFL punters, was far from the Pro Bowler he was in 2014. Heading into the 2017 season, Huber feels there is plenty of reason for optimism when it comes to the Bengals' special teams unit.
“All of the young guys are looking really good,” Huber said on Hobson's Choice Podcast. “Things are looking good right now, as far as special teams go. It's a bright spot right now.”
Arguably one of the best, if not the best punter in Bengals history, 2016 was an unusually poor season for Huber. Luckily, he seems to understand what exactly went wrong and is already in the process of remedying the issues.
“I started off a little slow. I think I started out pressing too hard to make up for some bad hits I had early, and I think I got away from the punting I usually do,” Huber said. “I've gotten back to that this offseason. I feel like I've been hitting the ball pretty well. I'm pretty happy with where I'm at right now. I just have to carry that through the summer and come intro training camp strong.
As far as long-term goals, he's shooting high.
“I'd love to get back to the Pro Bowl,” Huber says. “Everything I didn't like about last season. I feel like I'm on the right path to get to where I was kicking a couple of years ago. I think I can get back there and make a couple of Pro Bowls before I'm done.”
Huber received his first and only Pro Bowl berth following a stellar 2014 season in which he averaged 42.1 net yards per punt, put 37 percent of his punts within the 20 yard mark, and only put up an eight percent touchback frequency. In 2016, his net average was down to 39.5, his percentage inside the 20 was down to 29.5, and his touchback percentage was up to 10.3. Then again, his supporting cast didn't exactly make things easier.
“Definitely would have liked to have some better numbers last year,” Huber said. “I need to do a better job, myself. We had a lot of injuries last year, so it kind of screwed with our special teams core group, which kind of took the sink out of things. But, we have a lot of guys back, a lot of guys healthy now.”
Getting guys back healthy will certainly make a big difference. But, the massive influx of new players from the draft and free agency should go a long way toward improving the unit and allowing for consistent health on special teams.
The biggest problem with relying on so many new players is the lack of experience the new guys have with the Bengals' system. That is exactly where having long-tenured veterans like Huber can come in handy, to provide the leadership and direction the unit needs. In fact, Huber has the most experience in Cincinnati of all Bengals players (nine years, all with the Bengals).
“A big thing I think I can do with the special teams guys coming in is getting them up to speed to Darrin's style of coaching,” Huber said. “If you screw up, he's going to let you know … Just take it and know that he's noticing you … It's going to be big for me to keep these guys from panicking.”
The Bengals are fortunate to have a dedicated, passionate player like Huber to show the new guys how things work in the NFL. Not only is he a Cincinnati native with a vested interest in the success of the team, but he is also arguably the most qualified and experienced member of the team to provide guidance to the young players.
“I'm the oldest Bengal, I'm not the oldest guy yet,” Huber explained, as though he's been with the Bengals for more years than any other guy on the team, he's not the oldest player on the roster. “My wife and I were taking a look at that that this offseason and all the guys we lost and I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I might be the oldest guy.”
At 31-years-old, Huber is not the oldest player on the team, but he's not far behind. Adam Jones (33, turns 34 on September 30, 2017) is the oldest and Eric Winston (33, turns 34 on November 17) is a close second. Clark Harris (32) and Wallace Gillberry (32) are also older than Huber. Harris, who has been Huber's long snapper throughout his entire career (save for a few games), has been with the Bengals since October 2009. So while Huber has just a few months on Harris, no other member of the team has been with the Bengals that long without a break. Even Andre Smith, who was drafted by the Bengals in 2009, spent 2016 with the Minnesota Vikings and, therefore, has one less year of experience with the Bengals than Harris and Huber.
In 2017, it will be up to guys like Harris and Huber to make sure the special teams unit plays up to the standards it is capable of. Huber seems to believe it is a distinct possibility and is focused on realizing that vision.
Unfortunately, the fall of Rome is a pattern repeated by empires throughout history ... including ours?
A group of libertarians gathered in Las Vegas recently for an event called “FreedomFest.” We debated whether America will soon fall, as Rome did.
Historian Carl Richard said that today's America resembles Rome.
The Roman Republic had a constitution, but Roman leaders often ignored it. “Marius was elected consul six years in a row, even though under the constitution (he) was term-limited to one year.”
[pullquote]
Sounds like New York City's Mayor Bloomberg.
“We have presidents of both parties legislating by executive order, saying I'm not going to enforce certain laws because I don't like them. ... That open flouting of the law is dangerous because law ceases to have meaning. ... I see that today. ... Congress passes huge laws they haven't even read (as well as) overspending, overtaxing and devaluing the currency.”
The Romans were worse. I object to President Obama's $100 million dollar trip, but Nero traveled with 1,000 carriages.
Tiberius established an “office of imperial pleasures,” which gathered “beautiful boys and girls from all corners of the world” so, as Tacitus put it, the emperor “could defile them.”
Emperor Commodus held a show in the Colosseum at which he personally killed five hippos, two elephants, a rhinoceros and a giraffe.
To pay for their excesses, emperors devalued the currency. (Doesn't our Fed do that by buying $2 trillion of government debt?)
Nero reduced the silver content of coins to 95 percent. Then Trajan reduced it to 85 percent and so on. By the year 300, wheat that once cost eight Roman dollars cost 120,000 Roman dollars.
The president of the Foundation for Economic Education, Lawrence Reed, warned that Rome, like America, had an expanding welfare state. It started with “subsidized grain. The government gave it away at half price. But the problem was that they couldn't stop there ... a man named Claudius ran for Tribune on a platform of free wheat for the masses. And won. It was downhill from there.”
Soon, to appease angry voters, emperors gave away or subsidized olive oil, salt and pork. People lined up to get free stuff.
Rome's government, much like ours, wasn't good at making sure subsidies flowed only to the poor, said Reed: “Anybody could line up to get these goods, which contributed to the ultimate bankruptcy of the Roman state.”
As inflation increased, Rome, much like the U.S. under President Nixon, imposed wage and price controls. When people objected, Emperor Diocletian denounced their “greed,” saying, “Shared humanity urges us to set a limit.”
Doesn't that sound like today's anti-capitalist politicians?
Diocletian was worse than Nixon. Rome enforced controls with the death penalty -- and forbid people to change professions. Emperor Constantine decreed that those who broke such rules “be bound with chains and reduced to servile condition.”
Eventually, Rome's empire was so large -- and people so resentful of centralized control -- that generals in outlying regions began declaring independence from Rome.
At FreedomFest, Matt Kibbe, president of the Tea Party group FreedomWorks, also argued that America could soon collapse like Rome did.
“The parallels are quite ominous -- the debt, the expansionist foreign policy, the arrogance of executive power taking over our country,” says Kibbe. “But I do think we have a chance to stop it.”
That's a big difference between today's America and yesterday's Rome. We have movements like the tea party and libertarianism and events like FreedomFest that alert people to the danger in imperial Washington and try to fight it. If they can wake the public, we have hope.
The triumph of liberty is not inevitable, though. And empires do crumble.
Rome's lasted the longest. The Ottoman Empire lasted 623 years. China's Song, Qing and Ming dynasties each lasted about 300 years.
We've lasted just 237 years so far -- sometimes behaving like a republic and sometimes an empire. In that time, we've accomplished amazing things, but we shouldn't take our continued success for granted.
Freedom and prosperity are not natural. In human history, they're rare.

Cardinal says Greens motion calling on him to return to Australia to face allegations of misconduct interferes in ‘due process' of police investigation
Cardinal George Pell has accused the Senate of waging an “extraordinary and unjust” attack against him and interfering with due process.
A Greens motion, agreed to by the upper house in February, called on the senior ranking Catholic clergyman to return to Australia to face allegations of misconduct.
“The use of parliamentary privilege to attack me on this basis is both extraordinary and unjust,” Pell wrote in a letter tabled in parliament on Monday.
“Given that the investigation is ongoing, any calls from the Senate for my return to Australia can only be perceived as an interference on the part of the Senate in the due process of the Victoria police investigation.”
Pell has denied all allegations of wrongdoing, saying he was willingly interviewed by police in Rome last year and continued to cooperate with their investigations.
Police and prosecutors had not requested his presence in Australia, he said.
Once again Cardinal Pell has thrown his men to the wolves – it's everyone's fault but his | Kristina Keneally Read more
Pell appeared on three occasions to give evidence at the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.
“Any fair-minded person would conclude that I have made every effort to be available to the royal commission and to Victoria police to assist with their inquiries,” he said.
The vast majority of allegations highlighted in the Senate's motion related to the period before his time as archbishop, Pell said.
“It is unjust and seriously misleading to link all offences and allegations against church personnel to me.”
When the motion was presented, the Greens senator Rachel Siewert told MPs under parliamentary privilege: “Cardinal Pell has done a very good job at avoiding a return to Australia – it is time he came back.”
In his letter, sent from the Vatican on 15 February, Pell said he had been clear in his statements rejecting allegations against him.
“I strongly believe that I should be permitted the same due process as any other Australian in an ongoing investigation, and that the Senate's interference in that regard is extraordinary,” he said. “I call on the Senate to move to withdraw its call for me to return to Australia.”

Room for Operation Sovereign Borders briefings cost $235,000, including $800 doorknob, and annual cost is close to $100,000
Scott Morrison's $330,000 media briefing room has never been used
Taxpayers have forked out close to $330,000, including $800 for a doorknob, for a border protection media briefing room that has not been used since its completion 10 months ago.
Construction and fitout costs for the hi-tech room totalled almost $235,000 while the annual cost of having it on standby is running at close to $100,000.
The government is leasing the premises, next to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's aid office in Canberra, until June 2016.
It is also paying $10,000 a month to hire audio-visual equipment on top of a $30,000 bill for rented stage lights, according to documents obtained by AAP under Freedom of Information.
The heavily-redacted documents reveal the facility was ready for media briefings in October 2013, but it has never been used for that purpose.
It is understood the room was intended for Operation Sovereign Borders media briefings presented by the immigration minister, Scott Morrison, until late last year.
Instead, the weekly briefings were held at commonwealth offices in Sydney.
The briefings ended in December, coinciding with reports of asylum-seeker boat turnbacks, which the government refused to discuss.
In Canberra, Morrison has mostly used Parliament House facilities for border protection-related press conferences.
In mid-July, he launched a national border targeting centre at the Customs Border Protection headquarters, located across the road from the briefing room. He addressed reporters after the launch in a Customs room.
The unused media centre has large LED monitors, a projector, spotlights, two podiums with microphones, audio splitters and space to fit four television camera tripods and seating for 20 journalists. Invoices show $800 was spent on a single door knob.
We've recently finished some technology that will allow us to make serverside updates to Path of Exile without needing downtime. It's likely to be in the 1.0.6 or 1.1.0 patch (after being sufficiently tested). Once this is deployed, we'll be able to hotfix server problems (like bugs or balance issues) in a non-disruptive way. This will probably mean that we deploy small updates more regularly and will be extremely valuable after large patches where it's extremely important to be able to deploy minor fixes quickly and without rebooting all the servers.
I also wanted to clarify that Act 4 is not part of March's 1.1.0 content update. There is a pile of new content, including some new game areas, but an entire Act takes way more than four months to create. While most of the community understand that Acts can take over a year to produce (depending on how much funding we have available), I've been seeing posts where people were confused about the word "expansion" that I used to describe the March update. While we think of it as an expansion because it contains so many different things, it doesn't have the new character class or new act that people seem to expect from the word. Because of this, we've moved away from using that language. What's something called that's a lot larger than a regular content update but smaller than the gigantic update that will introduce Act 4? A mini-expansion? Either way, the March update has its own name and you'll find out information starting in early February :) YouTube |

Adding a marketplace to Battle.net is taking longer than Blizzard expected, and there's even a chance the project might get cancelled altogether.
Dustin Browder, StarCraft 2's lead designer, says that Blizzard is "struggling" to create a marketplace for its Battle.net platform. This is the first time that the developer has ever tried to build such a service, and Browder says that there are a lot of difficult issues to solve before it can launch.
Blizzard originally announced the marketplace for Battle.net at Blizzcon in 2009. It was intended to be a venue for players to trade maps for StarCraft 2. This would include both free maps, and player-created, "premium" maps. The marketplace was supposed to launch soon after StarCraft 2's release, but, as yet, still hasn't materialized.
Browder said that player's right issues - like how to prevent players from ripping off other people's content - were proving a stumbling block, as was working out appropriate price points. He said that there wasn't a firm launch date that Blizzard was working towards for the marketplace - which isn't all that unusual for the developer - but that people shouldn't expect to see it in the near future.
In fact, Browder said that there was a chance that the marketplace may never see the light of day. He didn't suggest that Blizzard was really considering cancelling the project just yet, but he also didn't rule it out either. He pointed out that Blizzard had cancelled Warcraft Adventures - a game that was early complete - and implied that the marketplace could suffer the same fate if Blizzard couldn't figure out how to make it work.

“Make Love Loudly. Make War Silently.”
So reads an ad for the Advanced Armament Company, which produces silencers for assault weapons. These gadgets, long associated with snipers and Hollywood assassins, represent the latest push by a gun industry seeking new ways to boost sales in a country that is already home to some 310 million civilian firearms.
The silencer industry is “the highest-growth niche of the firearms industry right now,” says Josh Waldron, founder and CEO of the Utah-based Silencerco. According to Waldron, the industry has seen 400 to 500 percent growth over the past five years. In 2008, he says, American silencer companies sold about 18,000 units in the United States. In fiscal 2012, “We're gonna do over 110,000.”
Further growth, though, is somewhat hampered by the fact that silencers (also called “suppressors”) are tightly regulated—even more so than the guns they attach to. Silencers are a Class III weapon regulated under the National Firearms Act, a Prohibition-era law that was designed to curtail or even prohibit the transfer of weapons deemed especially dangerous, like machine guns.
Because of this designation, buying a silencer requires a full FBI background check of the sort undergone by people applying for federal jobs, a process that can take up to eight months, Waldron says, and there's a one-time $200 tax imposed to cover it, which drives up the cost. (The tax was supposed to be a big deterrent to buying NFA weapons in 1934, when the act was implemented, but it hasn't gone up since Al Capone's heyday.) Illegally possessing a silencer can bring mandatory federal jail sentences of up to 10 years and fines up to $250,000. The devices are banned entirely in 11 states, including California and New York, and many states limit their use for hunting and on public lands.
Along with all the obstacles to purchasing one, the silencer also suffers from a bit of an image problem. Advocates like Waldron like to point to the gizmo's innocuous beginnings. The silencer was invented by Hirum Percy Maxim in 1908. And, as the lore goes, Teddy Roosevelt supposedly used one of the devices on his Winchester Model 94 at home in Long Island so that he could shoot varmints without disturbing his neighbors.
The modern silencer, however, was refined and improved by a former CIA dark-ops contractor named Mitch WerBell, whom federal agents once caught training Cuban and Haitian mercenaries for an attack intended to topple Haitian strongman Papa Doc Duvalier. (In the 1950s, WerBell had served as a security adviser to Cuba's Batista regime.)
Alex Zaitchik provided a condensed history of WerBell's assault weapons silencer in a December Salon article, explaining that it was first used by CIA death squads working in Vietnam. The suppressor served to improve kill rates and to reduce ammo waste in targeted killing operations. It also helped boost the accuracy and power of the weapons, earning WerBell the nickname, “Wizard of Whistling Death.”
At one time, this disturbing history even prompted the NRA to bar silencer manufacturers from the group's national convention out of the fear that including them would make guns look bad. But that's all changed now that the silencer industry has enlisted the nation's biggest gun lobby to help it chip away at restrictive state laws.
In 2011, frustrated by the silencer's image problem, Waldron, along with Advanced Armament Corp., Gemtech, and other silencer manufacturers helped founded the American Silencer Association. Their goal, Waldron told me, was “to get more people and legislators to understand that silencers are actually safety devices and not what everybody thinks they are because of Hollywood.”
The ASA and the NRA, which receives financial support from Waldron's Silencerco, are pressuring state legislatures to ease up and let people own and use silencers for hunting. Several states have obliged recently, including Wyoming, and Montana and Georgia are in the pipeline, too. The NRA touts the health benefits of sparing hunters' hearing. It also plays the Roosevelt “varmint hunting” card, arguing that silencers enable ranchers to kill rodents without scaring the livestock.
But the gun-toting models featured in the industry's ads don't look like they're just out to shoot some groundhogs. In one, the Advanced Armament Corp. notes that silencers eliminate muzzle flash that could interfere with the effectiveness of night-vision equipment. The ad also declares that silencers minimize recoil and enable “more accurate and rapid follow-up shots.” The ASA's website adds that one of the key benefits is the silencer's ability to “disguise the position of the shooter in low light environments.”
It's not hard to imagine the appeal of these benefits to a would-be mass shooter. But Waldron insists that very little crime is committed with silencers. “Silencer owners are the most law abiding citizens there are. They have to go through too much to lose it,” he insists. “There's more people that win a lottery by droves than guys who buy guns in a legal fashion and then go on a rampage.”
Still, there's no denying that silencers appeal to unstable people. Just a few weeks ago, law enforcement in California detonated a bunch of booby-trapped backyard explosive at the home of this guy, where they found two cannons, a silencer, and the man's emaciated 82-year-old mother living in squalor.
And then there's Christopher Dorner, the former Los Angeles cop accused of killing three people in January, one of them a police officer. After the manhunt for Dorner led to his a fiery end at a cabin in Big Bear, California, investigators found among his possessions a trove of high-powered weapons, including 10 silencers—some of which he'd identified in an online manifesto as having come from the Advanced Armament Corp.
In his Facebook manifesto, Dorner wrote that he had bought the silencers legally without a background check by creating a trust account using Quicken's Willmaker software and paying a notary $10 to make it legal. This loophole has become a common ploy to evade background checks, and it enabled Dorner to obtain the silencer quickly, with the help of a friendly Nevada firearms dealer who ignored the fact that Dorner lived in a state where silencers are banned.
Although the investigation is ongoing, a spokeswoman for the Irvine Police Department said there has been public speculation that Dorner used a silencer when he killed the daughter of a retired LAPD officer and her fiancé, who were sitting in their car in an Irving condo complex. No one, she says, reported hearing any gunshots in the densely populated area where the couple was killed.
Ironically enough, Dorner had expressed outrage in his manifesto over how easy it was to procure the silencers. “Should I be able to purchase these class III weapons (SBR's, and suppressors) without a background check and just a $10 notary signature on a quicker will maker [sic] program? The answer is NO. I'm not even a resident of the state i purchased them in. Lock n Load,” he wrote. Dorner also scoffed at gun enthusiasts who promoted such accessories. “Who in there [sic] right mind needs a fucking silencer!!!”
With just a week before the election, Hillary Clinton reminded Florida voters that Donald Trump has been called out for "demeaning, degrading, insulting, and assaulting women."
"But I guess the bottom line is, he thinks belittling women makes him a bigger man. And I don't think there's a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like," Clinton said in Dade City, one of her three stops in Florida on Nov. 1.
"We can stand up for what we believe, what we want for our children and our grandchildren, what we know is right. And you can go down the list of everything he has said," Clinton said of Trump. "He doesn't believe in equal pay, he thinks pregnancy is an inconvenience, he won't raise the minimum wage, and he said if he comes home and dinner is not on the table, he gets angry."
That's a long list. Here, we wanted to know if Trump has taken a position against equal pay. We found that Trump has said various things but at times has said he supports the concept that women and men should make equal pay.
Equal pay
We've detailed key issues about the gender wage gap in our PolitiFact Sheet, but a consistent argument is that women earn 77 cents on the dollar that men earn.
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it illegal for employers to discriminate against employees based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.
The Institute for Policy Women's Research says discrimination is a big factor for why the gender wage gap still persists. Experts consider "occupational segregation" another reason for the wage gap, which means women more often than men work in jobs that pay low and minimum wages.
In her campaign website, Clinton says she will work to close the pay gap and to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill she introduced when she was a senator.
Trump's stance
Trump's campaign website does not include specific policies for how he would handle equal pay concerns if he was elected president. But his campaign refuted Clinton's claim that Trump doesn't believe in equal pay.
"We support equal pay for equal work and will enforce all statutes against discrimination," Trump's campaign said in a statement.
At the Republican National Convention in July, Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, said that at Trump Organization "women are paid equally for the work that we do."
She said her father had made wage equality a practice at his company. "He will fight for equal pay for equal work, and I will fight for this too, right alongside of him," Trump said.
But before the convention, in January, the New York Times reported a former female Iowa field organizer filed a discrimination complaint, saying men at Trump's campaign doing the same jobs were paid more and were permitted to plan and speak at rallies, but her requests were ignored. Trump told the New York Times the former organizer was a disgruntled employee and that his people told him "she did a terrible job."
Factcheck.org in June noted Trump has likened equal pay legislation to socialism, and that performance, not gender, should determine compensation.
On Nov. 19, 2015, Trump said:
"Here is the problem. If you start getting involved with government on ‘this one gets this pay and this one gets that pay,' and then you say — ‘Where does it all start?' Because you could have a woman that's much better than a man, or you could have a woman that's not as good as man, if you sort of say, ‘Everybody gets equal pay,' you get away from the whole American Dream. You get away from capitalism in a sense.
"I can tell you, that I have women, honestly that are just, in many cases, they're better than men, and I pay them more than men. And to a certain extent, people have to go out there, they have to fight for themselves. … I don't know if people agree with me, once you get where everybody gets the same, I mean, you're into a socialistic society."
In August 2015, Trump said on MSNBC's Morning Joe that if men and women do the same job, they should get the same pay, "but it's very hard to say what is the same job."
Clinton's campaign pointed to another August 2015 interview, in which CNN's Chris Cuomo asked Trump if he would pass equal pay legislation.
Trump said he was looking into it "very strongly."
"One of the problems you have is you get to have an economy where it's no longer free enterprise economy," Trump said.
Trump said he favored the concept, but that it's "very complicated."
"I feel strongly -- the concept of it, I love," Trump said. "I just don't want it to be a negative, where everybody ends up making the same pay. That's not our system. You know, the world, everybody comes in to get a job, they make -- people aren't the same."
Our ruling
Clinton said Trump "doesn't believe in equal pay."
Trump's campaign website does not have a stipulated stance on equal pay for men and women, but his campaign says he supports "equal pay for equal work." Trump has said men and women doing the same job should get the same pay, but it's hard to determine what's "the same job," and that if everybody gets equal pay, "you get away from capitalism in a sense."
Trump has also said pay should be based on performance, not gender -- so he does appear to favor uniform payment if performance is alike.
Clinton's statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

Environment minister argues for historical justice on cutting carbon, but denies it to tribes living in the country's forests
On Tuesday, India's minister for environment, forests, and climate change, Prakash Javadekar, scoffed at the idea of the country reducing emissions to counter climate change. He held the US chiefly responsible for the climate crisis, and therefore it had to bear the responsibility for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. That has been India's position on climate change at international negotiations for a while.
Developed nations have polluted the atmosphere and brought the planet to the crisis it faces today. The developing world, lagging behind in industrial development, did little to create the situation. But China is now the world's biggest carbon emitter, and India is fast catching up as its economy grows.
On the strength of future emissions, the west wants these countries to commit to reducing their impact on climate change. To do so, developing nations want transfer of costly new green technology at low or no costs and compensation from developed nations for reducing their emissions. This is where past climate conferences have remained stuck, with each side entrenched in its position.
At the UN climate change summit in New York on Tuesday, Javadekar is reported to have said: “The moral principle of historic responsibility [those countries which have historically emitted the most] cannot be washed away.”
But while he champions historic responsibility abroad, he's an instrument of eroding historic justice at home.
India legislated the Wildlife Protection Act in 1972, a law that granted state protection to wildlife. But it criminalised many communities living in wildlife areas. Unlike the west, India's forests are not people-free wildlife havens.
Conservationists and the country's forest department regarded the presence of marginsalised people – mostly adivasis (tribal communities who have been living in the forests for centuries) – as a blight. They were, and still are, looked up on as people who degraded forests by cutting trees for firewood, clearing land for tilling and hunting wildlife for the pot. They received little support from the government. Some got paltry compensation to give up their traditional lands and settle outside forests.

Much of India was cleared of forests and its wildlife over centuries, some conservationists living in cities had no qualms seeking the eviction of people from forests. They argued that since only 5% of the country's land area was set aside for wildlife, it should be free of human disturbance. In short, the indigenous people of India's forests had to bear the cost of conservation, even though most of the country had been denuded of its forests by others.
In 2006, the Scheduled Tribes and Other Forest Dwellers Act (popularly called Forest Rights Act) came into force with stipulations for compensation against resettlement. Should any company wish to set up an industry or mine in tribal lands, it had to first seek the consent of forest-dwelling communities. This law sets right historic wrongs suffered by tribals. It also gives them a say in state's plans that impact their lands and lives.
Although the act is enacted by the parliament, many states haven't implemented it. Now Narendra Modi's pro-development government is seeking to do away with the right of forest dwellers to veto industries coming into their neck of the woods.
Earlier this month, Javadekar stated the government would amend the act so it would not be mandatory any more to seek forest people's consent. So much for historic justice.
In New York, however, he declared India will take action against climate change voluntarily and not at the behest of any other country. Yet at home, if a forest-destroying mine or a carbon-polluting coal plant chooses to plonk down on forest land, local people won't have a choice.
The question at the heart of both issues is: who bears the cost of arresting climate change and conserving forests?
On the international stage, India argues beneficiaries of past pollution have to bear the responsibility of mitigating climate change. But at home, it shows its hypocrisy by insisting that historically disenfranchised forest dwelling citizens bear the cost of conservation and development.
Hillary Clinton's proposal to accept an additional 65,000 Syrian refugees annually could potentially cost $403 billion in lifetime costs if implemented all four years in a hypothetical first term.
That's according to a new analysis released Monday by the Senate subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest.
Currently, the Obama administration is planning to take in 10,000 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2016, which ends September 30.
In total, the Obama administration is planning to take in 85,000 refugees, while the original plan was to take in 100,000 refugees. Clinton's proposal would potentially increase that number to 155,000 refugees entering the United States annually.
The total cost of refugees is not included in the resettlement budget provided to the Department of State and Department of Health and Human Services because of the myriad of social services refugees qualify for.
These social services include Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance For Needy Families, and other programs. (RELATED: Obama Administration Doesn't Rack Loans Given To Refugees)
Robert Rector, a scholar at the Heritage Foundation, estimated the costs of local, state, and federal benefits for refugees and found that the lifetime cost of admitting 10,000 refugees is $6.5 billion.
If Hillary Clinton, were to employ her refugee plan in office, her first year would lead to an estimated lifetime cost to taxpayers of of $100.7 billion.
Four years of a Clinton presidency with that rate of refugee resettlement would have a lifetime cost of $403 billion to taxpayers.
These figures also do not include the costs that would come along with resettling the family members of those refugees in the United States.
One year after being resettled, refugees are allowed to obtain Lawful Resident Status — green cards — and petition for family members to come over to the United States.
Five years after entering the U.S., refugees are able to become naturalized citizens and further petition for family members to come over.
There is also a program known as “follow-to-join” which allows for refugees to petition within in their first two years of entry for the admittance of spouses and unmarried children.
Refugees can also enter the U.S. through “private sponsorship.” That would include either work authorizations, student visas or medical visas. These refugees would not fall under the cap set by the government.
Abstract BACKGROUND: Obesity has become a major health problem across the world. In women, it is known to cause anovulation, subfecundity, increased risk of fetal anomalies and miscarriage rates. However, in women going for assisted reproduction the effects of obesity on egg quality, embryo quality, clinical pregnancy, live birth rates are controversial. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of women's body mass index (BMI) on the reproductive outcome of non donor In vitro fertilization (IVF)/Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The effects of BMI on their gonadotrophin levels (day 2 LH, FSH), gonadotrophin dose required for ovarian stimulation, endometrial thickness and oocyte/embryo quality were looked at, after correcting for age and poor ovarian reserve. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of medical records of 308 women undergoing non donor IVF cycles in a University affiliated teaching hospital. They were classified into three groups: normal weight (BMI<25 kg/m2), overweight (BMI>25 <30 kg/m2) and obese (BMI>30 kg/m2). All women underwent controlled ovarian hyper stimulation using long agonist protocol. RESULTS: There were 88 (28.6%) in the normal weight group, 147 (47.7%) in the overweight and 73 (23.7%) in the obese group. All three groups were comparable with respect to age, duration of infertility, female and male causes of infertility. The three groups were similar with respect to day 2 LH/FSH levels, endometrial thickness and gonadotrophin requirements, oocyte quality, fertilization, cleavage rates, number of good quality embryos and clinical pregnancy rates. CONCLUSION: Increase in body mass index in women does not appear to have an adverse effect on IVF outcome. However, preconceptual counselling for obese women is a must as weight reduction helps in reducing pregnancy-related complications. Keywords: Obesity, infertility, pregnancy outcome
INTRODUCTION Obesity is becoming a fast growing health problem across the world. In addition to diabetes and cardiovascular disease, it also leads to alterations in reproductive functions. Excess body fat leads to menstrual irregularities especially chronic oligo-anovulation and infertility. Obesity leads to hyperinsulinemia and consequent ovarian hyperandrogenism. Obesity is also known to affect fertility. Several prospective studies have shown that obesity leads to anovulatory infertility. It is associated with higher miscarriage rates and higher prevalence of gestatational diabetes and pregnancy induced hypertension.[1–3] In assisted reproduction, however, there are conflicting reports on the effect of obesity on oocyte quality, embryo development, lower number of mature oocytes, lower implantation and pregnancy rates.[4–8] Endometrium also seems to have a negative impact on reproductive outcome in studies based on oocyte donation model. The objective of our study is to assess the effect of women's BMI on the oocyte/embryo quality and the reproductive outcome of our non donor IVF/ICSI cycles.
MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of the case records of 308 consecutive women who underwent non donor IVF cycles in our institute. They were classified into three groups based on their BMI i.e. normal weight (BMI<25 kg/m2), overweight (25-30 kg/m2 and obese (>30 kg/m2). Potential confounding factors like the woman's age, origin of infertility and ovarian reserve were noted. Those women older than 40 years and with FSH more than 10mIU/ml were excluded from the analysis. All women underwent controlled ovarian hyperstimulation using long agonist protocol. This involved initial down regulation with GnRH agonist from the mid luteal phase of the previous menstrual cycle and maintained till human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) administration. Recombinant FSH ± HMG was started from day 2/3 of next cycle and the dosage was decided based on the patient's age, antral follicle count, basal FSH/LH levels and response to previous ovarian stimulation. Their dosages were adjusted according to serum LH, estradiol levels and ovarian response. hCG was administered subcutaneously when at least 3 follicles were ≥ 18 mm in dimension. Oocyte retrieval was done 36 h later followed by embryo transfer on day 3. Oocytes with expanded cumulus, radiant corona, distinct zona pellucida, clear cytoplasm, unfragmented first polar body and those without debris in the perivitelline space were considered as good.[9] After oocyte retrieval, fertilization was assessed the next day (day 1) and embryo cleavage 24 h later. Embryo morphology was studied on day 3 based onthe number of cells and fragmentation using the standard morphological criteria. A good day 3 embryo was defined as one with number of blastomeres greater than or equal to 8, fragmentation of < 20% and without multinucleated blastomeres.[10] Pearson Chi-square tests were used to compare the binary variables between the various groups classified according to the BMI. Parametric tests were used for comparisons between the BMI groups and continuous variables. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was then performed and post-hoc comparisons were made.
DISCUSSION Anovulation has been the major cause of subfertility in obese women.[1] Reduced conception rates (5% per unit increase in BMI above 29 kg/m2) have been described in normal cycling obese women as well. The effects of BMI in obese women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation have been controversial.[1,4–6] Our study shows that BMI has no adverse effects over IVF outcome. The blood hormone parameters (day 2 gonadotrophin values, estradiol levels on hCG day) were similar in all three groups irrespective of weight. Obese women are expected to have high LH values owing to insulin resistance. However, we did not find the same in our study. Some studies have highlighted a state of gonadotrophin resistance in obese women leading to higher gonadotrophin requirement for COH.[4] Some studies have not found any adverse effects of obesity on ovarian response in IVF. Our study groups comprising overweight and obese women showed similar gonadotrophin requirements as that of normal weight women. Also, the number of days of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation was similar in all the three groups. With regards to oocyte and embryo quality, some authors have reported poor quality among obese women.[8] Others have failed to find any association between the two. Lacunae still exists as regards the role of endometrium, the embryo in implantation in obese women. Many studies indicate lower implantation and pregnancy rates, higher miscarriage rates and increase pregnancy- related complications for the mother and the fetus.[11] Nichols et al., report reduced conception rates in overweight women undergoing IVF.[2] Wang et al., also support the same. However, there have been conflicting conclusions from other studies.[3] High miscarriage rates have been described in obese women conceiving naturally or after ART. A systematic review by Maheshwari et al., made similar observations in women with BMI greater than 25 kg/m2.[4] Metwally et al., in his meta analysis also observe similar trend in BMI greater than 25 kg/m 2 regardless of method of conception[8] In our study, we did not observe any difference between the three groups. This could be explained by the fact that the embryo quality was not affected by BMI. Our study thus does not show any adverse effects of obesity on endometrial thickness, hormone levels, oocyte number and quality, implantation and pregnancy rates. The role of endometrium and factors related to embryo are still under study. Other confounding factors like the role of male obesity on semen quality have not been taken into account. We need to study the crosstalk between the endometrium and the embryo at molecular level and study obesity in male partner, the effect of obesity on semen quality and hence embryo quality. We conclude that an increase in body mass index does not appear to have an adverse effect on IVF outcome. However, overweight and obese women must be counselled on weight reduction to reduce pregnancy-related complications.

Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21)
What are trisomies?
The term trisomy is used to describe the presence of three chromosomes, rather than the usual matched pair of chromosomes. For example, if a baby is born with three #21 chromosomes, rather than the usual pair, then the baby would be said to have "trisomy 21." Trisomy 21 is also known as Down syndrome. Other examples of trisomy include syndromes like trisomy 18 and trisomy 13. Again, trisomy 18 or trisomy 13 simply means the child has three copies of the #18 chromosome (or of the #13 chromosome) present in each cell of the body, rather than the usual pair.
What is Down syndrome?
Down syndrome is a genetic disorder that involves birth defects, intellectual disabilities, characteristic facial features. Additionally, it often involves heart defects, visual and hearing impairments, and other health problems. The severity of all of these problems varies greatly among affected individuals. Down syndrome is one of the most common genetic birth defects, affecting approximately one in about 800 babies. In this country, around 250,000 individuals have Down syndrome. Life expectancy among adults with Down syndrome is about 60 years, though average lifespan varies.
The term Down syndrome comes from Dr. Langdon Down, the doctor who first described the collection of physical symptoms in 1866. It was not until 1959 that the cause of Down syndrome (the presence of an extra #21 chromosome) was identified.
What causes Down syndrome?
Normally in reproduction, the egg cell of the mother and the sperm cell of the father start out with the usual number of 46 chromosomes. The egg and sperm cells both undergo a cell division in which the 46 chromosomes are divided in half, so that both the egg and the sperm cells will have 23 chromosomes each. When a sperm with 23 chromosomes fertilizes an egg with 23 chromosomes, the baby will have a complete set of 46 chromosomes, half from the father and half from the mother.
Sometimes, an error occurs when the 46 chromosomes are being divided in half, and an egg or sperm cell keeps both copies of the #21 chromosome instead of just one copy. If this egg or sperm is fertilized, then the baby will have three copies of the #21 chromosome, which is called trisomy 21, or Down syndrome. The features of Down syndrome are caused by that extra copy of chromosome #21 being in every cell in the body.
Most cases of Down syndrome are caused by trisomy 21. Occasionally, the extra chromosome #21 or a portion of it is attached to another chromosome in the egg or sperm; this may cause "translocation Down syndrome." This is the only form of Down syndrome that may be inherited from a parent. Some parents have a rearrangement called a balanced translocation, in which the #21 chromosome is attached to another chromosome, but it does not affect their own health. Rarely, another form called "mosaic Down syndrome" may occur when an error in cell division happens after fertilization. These individuals have some cells with an extra chromosome #21 (47 chromosomes total), and other cells have the usual number (46 total).
What does a child with Down syndrome look like?
A child with Down syndrome may have eyes that slant upward and small ears that may fold over slightly at the top. The child's mouth may be small, making the tongue appear large. The child's nose also may be small, with a flattened nasal bridge. Some babies with Down syndrome have a short neck and small hands with short fingers. Rather than having three "creases" in the palm of the hand, a child with Down syndrome usually has one single crease that goes straight across the palm, and a second crease that curves down by the thumb. The child or adult with Down syndrome is often short and has unusual looseness of the joints. Most children with Down syndrome will have some, but not all, of these features.
What types of health problems do children with Down syndrome typically have?
About half of babies with Down syndrome have heart defects. Some defects are minor and may be treated with medications, while others may require surgery. All babies with Down syndrome should be examined by a pediatric cardiologist. This is a doctor who specializes in heart diseases of children. Babies with Down syndrome should also have an echocardiogram. This is a procedure that evaluates the structure and function of the heart by using sound waves recorded on an electronic sensor that produce a moving picture of the heart and heart valves. This exam and test should be done in the first two months of life, so that any heart defects can be treated.
Some babies with Down syndrome are born with intestinal malformations that require surgery.
Children with Down syndrome are at increased risk for visual impairment. Common visual problems include crossed eyes, near- or farsightedness, and cataracts. Most visual problems can be improved with glasses, surgery, or other treatments. A pediatric ophthalmologist should be consulted within the first year of life. This is a doctor who specializes in comprehensive eye care and provides examinations, diagnosis, and treatment for a variety of eye disorders.
Children with Down syndrome may have hearing loss because of fluid in the middle ear, a nerve defect, or both. All children with Down syndrome should have regular vision and hearing examinations so any problems can be treated before they hinder development of language and other skills.
Children with Down syndrome are at increased risk for thyroid problems and leukemia. They also tend to have many colds, as well as bronchitis and pneumonia. Children with Down syndrome should receive regular medical care, including childhood immunizations. The National Down Syndrome Congress publishes a "Preventive Medicine Checklist" that outlines which checkups and medical tests are recommended at various ages.
How significant is the degree of intellectual disability that accompanies Down syndrome?
The degree of intellectual disability that accompanies Down syndrome varies widely. It ranges from mild to moderate to severe. However, most intellectual disability falls within the mild to moderate range. There is no way to predict the mental development of a child with Down syndrome based on their physical features.
What disabilities does a child with Down syndrome have?
Children with Down syndrome can usually do most things that any young child can do, such as walking, talking, dressing, and being toilet trained. However, they generally do these things later than other children. The exact age that these developmental milestones will be achieved cannot be predicted. However, early intervention programs, beginning in infancy, can help these children achieve their individual potential.
Can a child with Down syndrome go to school?
Yes. There are special programs beginning in the preschool years to help children with Down syndrome develop skills as fully as possible. Along with benefiting from early intervention and special education, many children can be integrated into the regular classroom, to some extent. The outlook for children with Down syndrome is far brighter than it once was. Many will learn to read and write and participate in diverse childhood activities, both at school and in their neighborhoods. While special work programs are designed for adults with Down syndrome, many can hold regular jobs. Today, an increasing number of adults with Down syndrome live semi-independently in community group homes. They take care of themselves, participate in household chores, develop friendships, partake in leisure activities, and work in their communities.
Can people with Down syndrome marry?
Some people with Down syndrome marry. Although there have been rare exceptions, most men with Down syndrome cannot father a child. In any pregnancy, a woman with Down syndrome has a 50/50 chance of conceiving a child with Down syndrome, although many of the pregnancies are miscarried.
How is Down syndrome diagnosed?
Since Down syndrome has such a unique group of characteristics, physicians can sometimes determine whether a baby has Down syndrome simply by physical examination. To confirm the physical findings, a small blood sample can be taken and the chromosomes can be analyzed to determine the presence of extra #21 chromosome material. This information is important in determining the risk in future pregnancies. (Translocation Down syndrome and mosaic Down syndrome have different recurrence risks in future pregnancies).
Chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome can often be diagnosed before birth by analyzing cells in the amniotic fluid or from the placenta. Fetal ultrasound during pregnancy can also give information about the possibility of Down syndrome, but ultrasound is not 100 percent accurate. Many babies with Down syndrome may look the same on ultrasound as those without Down syndrome. A chromosome analysis, whether performed on a blood sample, cells from the amniotic fluid, or placenta, is very accurate.
What are the maternal age risks for Down syndrome?
The mother's age at delivery is the only factor found to be linked to the risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. This risk increases with every year, especially after the mother is 35 years old. However, because younger women are more likely to have babies than older women, most babies with Down syndrome are born to women younger than 35.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that all pregnant women, regardless of age, be offered screening for Down syndrome.
What is the risk of having a second child with Down syndrome?
In general, for women who have had one child with Down syndrome, the chance of having another baby with Down syndrome depends on several factors, such as the mother's age. It is important to know that most babies with Down syndrome are born to women under 35. This is because women under 35 have more babies than women over 35. Your physician may refer you to a geneticist or genetic counselor who can explain the results of chromosomal tests in detail, including what the recurrence risks may be in another pregnancy, and what tests are available to diagnose chromosome problems before a baby is born.
Can Down syndrome be cured or prevented?
There is no cure for Down syndrome. Doctors are not certain how to prevent the chromosomal error that causes Down syndrome. To date, there is no reason to believe that a parent could have done anything to cause or prevent the birth of a baby with Down syndrome. However, a recent study suggests that some women who have had a baby with Down syndrome had an abnormality in how their body metabolizes, or processes, the B vitamin folic acid. If confirmed, this finding may provide yet another reason why all women who might become pregnant should take a daily multivitamin containing 400 micrograms of folic acid. This has been shown to reduce the risk for certain birth defects of the brain and spinal cord.
Some people claim that various high-dose vitamins given to children with Down syndrome will improve the mental performance and lessen the degree of intellectual disability. To date, however, no medical studies have proved that this actually works. It is important for new families to talk with their physician, other families, and national Down syndrome support agencies to learn what to expect with Down syndrome and to learn about things that may be helpful in raising a child with Down syndrome.

Asynchronous Ring
You might already know about the current proposal to introduce support for asynchronous handlers in Ring. In this post I'm going to try to summarise the proposed design, and talk a little about why it was chosen. I can't cover everything, but I'll try to provide an overview.
Asynchronous handlers
In previous versions of Ring, handlers were written:
(defn handler [request] {:status 200, :headers {}, :body "Hello World"})
In the current beta, handlers can also be written to take two additional arguments, respond and raise . Responses are delivered via the response function, rather than the function's return value. Exceptions are reported via raise , rather than thrown.
(defn handler [request respond raise] (respond {:status 200, :headers {}, :body "Hello World"}))
Handlers can support both synchronous and asynchronous use by dispatching on arity:
(defn handler ([request] {:status 200, :headers {}, :body "Hello World"}) ([request respond raise] (respond {:status 200, :headers {}, :body "Hello World"}))
Asynchronous middleware
One advantage of this design is that we can write Ring middleware to support both synchronous and asynchronous use with the same function.
In previous versions of Ring, middleware returned a synchronous handler:
(defn wrap-foo [handler value] (fn [request] (-> (handler request) (assoc-in [:headers "X-Foo"] value))))
In the current beta, middleware can return a handler that supports synchronous and asynchronous arities:
(defn foo-response [response value] (assoc-in response [:headers "X-Foo"] value)) (defn wrap-foo [handler value] (fn ([request] (foo-response (handler request) value)) ([request respond raise] (handler request #(respond (foo-response % value)) raise))))
Because both synchronous and asynchronous use share functionality, we've factored out common behaviour in this example into a function called foo-response . By convention, anything modifying the request map should go into into a function named foo-request , and anything modifying the response goes into foo-response .
This convention has been used in Ring Core for a while in order to help support interceptors in Pedestal. If we adopt the same convention for asynchronous handlers in general, we can benefit the Pedestal ecosystem as well as Ring.
Streaming responses
In previous versions of Ring, there was a choice of four types for the response body: strings, seqs, files and input streams. The current beta expands this to include the StreamableResponseBody protocol, which allows you to define how a type is written to the response OutputStream .
For example, we can extend the protocol to cover core.async channels:
(extend-type ManyToManyChannel StreamableResponseBody (write-body-to-stream [channel response output-stream] (go (with-open [writer (io/writer output-stream)] (loop [] (when-let [msg (<! channel)] (doto writer (.write msg) (.flush)) (recur)))))))
This allows a channel to be used as a response body. The server will keep the response open until the channel is closed.
A handler that makes use of a channel body might look something like this:
(defn hello-world [request respond raise] (let [ch (chan)] (respond {:status 200, :headers {}, :body ch}) (go (<! (a/timeout 1000)) (>! ch "hello
") (<! (a/timeout 1000)) (>! ch "world
") (a/close! ch))))
Upon receiving a response, the above example waits a second, sends “hello”, waits another second, then sends “world” and ends the response. The go-block returns immediately, so we only block a thread when we're actively sending data to the client.
Non-blocking I/O
One omission to the Ring beta is support for non-blocking I/O, particularly around writing the response body. An OutputStream blocks until to write has finished, using up a thread while data is being transmitted. While this is better than using up a thread for the entire duration of the response, it's still not perfect.
Fortunately there's nothing stopping Ring from supporting multiple protocols, and allowing the adapter to choose the most suitable. For example, a String might satisfy both the current StreamableResponseBody protocol and a future NonBlockingResponseBody protocol. A synchronous adapter could choose the former, an asynchronous one the latter.
However, non-blocking I/O is tricky to implement in Ring, because all Java web servers have a different implementation. Ring will need to find a common protocol that can work with all of them, and so non-blocking I/O has been pushed back to future release. In the meanwhile, adapters can use specialised protocols that are tied to a particular web server. More on that later.
Alternative designs
Now that I've covered the changes to Ring, it's worth briefly covering some alternative designs, and explaining why were not chosen for Ring.
Pedestal is a web framework that uses interceptors in place of middleware. An interceptor is asynchronous, and has the advantage of context; it both can see what other interceptors are queued, and even alter the queue dynamically. The cost is that interceptors are quite a bit more complex than middleware.
Interceptors were avoided largely because they aren't compatible with Ring's existing middleware. They wouldn't be an enhancement to Ring's handlers and middleware, but a complete replacement.
Aleph is a Ring-compatible web server that supports asynchronous behaviour. For this it uses Manifold, a library that provides asynchronous building blocks. Responses can be returned wrapped in Manifold deferreds, and the response body can be a Manifold stream.
Aleph's model is backward compatible with Ring, but was was not used because it's tied to Manifold. Manifold is an impressive library, but it's also a sizeable dependency and has yet to reach version 1.0.0, making it too large and too risky to be adopted by Ring.
HTTP Kit is another Ring-compatible web server with asynchronous behaviour. Unlike Aleph it doesn't use asynchronous promises, but instead exposes a channel for writing the response, bypassing the return value. This is similar to Ring's asynchronous handlers, but HTTP Kit uses the same send! function for both delivering the response and for streaming the response body.
This design wasn't chosen because it makes it difficult for middleware to handle the response, and because to send! function is too dependent on when it's called; the first time it's called on a channel is different to all subsequent times. In Ring, this is handled by two separate functions: the response argument passed to the handler, and the write-body-to-stream method that's part of the StreamableResponseBody protocol.
Compatibility
Ring's asynchronous handlers are designed to be compatible with the broadest possible range of Java and Clojure web servers. Perhaps most importantly, Ring supports the latest stable Java Servlet specification (3.1) out of the box, making it compatible with the majority of Java web servers.
While it doesn't adopt Aleph's design, asynchronous Ring handlers can be automatically converted into asynchronous Aleph handlers (and vice versa):
(defn ring->aleph [handler] (fn [request] (let [response (d/deferred)] (handler request #(d/success! response %) #(d/error! response %)) response)))
Similarly, we can write a compatibility layer for HTTP Kit as well:
(defn ring->httpkit [handler] (fn [request] (with-channel request channel (handler request #(send! channel %) (fn [_] (close channel))))))
When it comes to writing to the response body, adapters should support Ring's StreamableResponseBody protocol. However, as mentioned previously, they can also add their own protocols, and use the StreamableResponseBody as a fallback.
For example, a future HTTP Kit release there could expose a protocol to support writing a type to the HTTP Kit channel:
(defprotocol ChannelResponseBody (write-body-to-channel [body response channel])) (extend-protocol ChannelResponseBody String (write-body-to-channel [body _ channel] (send! channel body)) clojure.lang.ISeq (write-body-to-channel [body _ channel] (doseq [x body] (send! channel (str x) false)) (close channel)))
HTTP Kit could check if a type satisfies ChannelResponseBody before Ring's native StreamableResponseBody . As HTTP Kit's channels don't block on write, we'd expect the more specific ChannelResponseBody protocol to be more performant, and therefore should be preferred by HTTP Kit.
Synchronous vs. Asynchronous
It's hard to judge how many people will need asynchronous handlers. Even the most modest of web servers is capable of running thousands of threads, and even web applications with a significant number of users often need to support surprisingly low numbers of connections.
For example, in 2009, when Twitter had around 350,000 users, they dealt with an average of 200-300 connections per second, with spikes of 800. In this case, a thread per connection seems perfectly reasonable, even with only one web server, let alone a reasonably-sized cluster.
Zach Tellman points out that web services often fall under much heavier load than user-facing websites, and it's not just the average load we need to worry about, but the peak. For instance, an API might come suddenly under considerable load as the result of an automated process. Most web servers buffer connections until a thread is available, but clients may still see significant spikes in latency because of this.
That said, in many cases the web server won't be the performance bottleneck. Web servers can be scaled horizontally, while many databases cannot, so the bottleneck often ends up being the database. The cost of an additional web server is small compared to the cost of a developer's time, so it's generally cheaper to spin up another web server than it is to change existing code. While brute forcing a problem in this way may seem inelegant, trading CPU-time for development time is usually a good deal.
Aside from web services that expect significant load, technologies that rely on keeping the response open, such as Server-Sent Events or long polling, may also need to manage large numbers of simultaneous connections. The longer a connection is kept open, the more attractive asynchronous handlers become, even under relatively small loads.
I don't expect asynchronous HTTP to be necessary for most web applications; but I do think there are enough cases where it could be useful that it's worth adding optional support for them. If asynchronous HTTP was completely unnecessary, I don't believe we'd see asynchronous support in web servers like Pedestal, Aleph or HTTP Kit.
The intent is for Ring's asynchronous handlers to be a specialised tool. Their design makes it relatively straightforward to convert a Ring application that uses synchronous handlers into one that makes selective use of asynchronous handlers. This encourages beginning with a synchronous design, and then moving to an asynchronous one if performance becomes an issue.
Feedback
Ring 1.6.0 represents a significant change, so the beta-testing period will be long. There's plenty of time to try it out and give feedback, either on the mailing list or in a private email. I'll also do my best to respond to any comments on r/clojure.
If you want me to go into more detail on any of the aspects of the design, please feel free to ask. This post is intended to be a summary, rather than a complete explanation, and there's plenty of detail I've had to omit or cover only briefly.
In 24 hours, Penn State head coach James Franklin has managed an emotional shift in momentum that few coaches ever encounter.
Five years past sanctions that decimated the program and two-plus seasons into a rebuild that had lacked a proof-of-concept signature win, Penn State upset No. 2 Ohio State, 24-21, Saturday.
In an instant Penn State is now a potential 10-2 program favored in every remaining game in 2016, and Franklin has to shut off the attention he's scrambled to earn for three years.
“It's already done, except for the players who will talk to the media this week,” he told SB Nation on Monday. “It's all Purdue, Purdue, Purdue, already. We got a head start Sunday on shifting out of it.”
Franklin's week was also couched by extreme emotions. He dedicated the win to his niece and nephew, who lost their father, Franklin's brother-in-law, to cancer last week. Franklin drove to Philadelphia after practice on Tuesday, and after a whirlwind weekend, sat down early on Monday morning to explain the passing to his 8- and 9-year-old daughters.
“It's certainly been a long weekend,” he said.
The emotional shift can't be overstated. The first player to hug him on the sideline Saturday night was defensive lineman Garrett Sickels, who helped stymie the Ohio State offense with nine tackles and 2.5 sacks after being suspended the first half for missing a class.
“Garrett's been a model citizen for us for three years. We just had a situation where we had a bye week and some guys wanted to get home early for the long weekend. He ended up not going to a class,” Franklin said.
“I've been in a lot of places where you put the right guys on the field regardless, so there's nothing better when you can reinforce that type of message and still win. That carries a lot of weight. He came out and played with his hair on fire, and then he's the first person to grab me at the end of the game, and tells me he loves me.
“A win like this, it helps everything.”
1. The momentum-changing touchdown before the half almost didn't happen.
After a pair of 1-yard gains set up third-and-9 on their own 28 with less than a minute ticking away, Penn State coaches were split on maintaining the drive and risking any kind of turnover or pressing on to add points before Ohio State would start the second half with the ball.
After a blocked field goal on their first drive, the Lions' next five possessions had averaged 15.2 yards. Down 12-0 and without Trace McSorley's favorite target, tight end Mike Gesicki, Franklin wanted some kind of momentum on offense, so the potential reward outweighed the risk.
“There was a lot of debate on the headset, so that's why we called timeout. The decision [to keep going] ended up being a crucial sequence in the game, so it was definitely a big moment.”
McSorley hit passes of 19, 34, and 20 yards on the touchdown drive, the first three catches of the game for Penn State's receivers.
2. Penn State's defense rode the hot hands.
The defensive approach to the Buckeyes was simple: Create pressure up front and prevent explosive plays of 20-plus yards. J.T. Barrett was sacked six times and averaged 5.7 yards per attempt, thanks in part to a healthier Lion linebacker core. PSU returned linebackers Jason Cabinda and Brandon Bell from injuries after a month off the field.
Franklin:
“I told the media and the team our plan was to play those guys about 25 plays, because to expect them to come back and play a full game wasn't realistic. Bell finished with 69 plays, so: so much for planning. He got hot.
“And I take pride in being organized and having a plan as anyone, but you have to trust your players' instincts.”
3. 2016 Penn State is a complete Big Ten roster, but it's still building.
It always fails in the media and among fans, but Franklin's internal sales pitch during his first two years, operating under 65 scholarships, was look how close you already are. That meant turning a 2014 double-OT loss at home to Ohio State in Franklin's first season into a stepping stone.
“I think part of the win goes back to that game. We took that same team to double overtime with 65 scholarship players. It absolutely had an effect on this game. Our guys came into prep thinking they could play, that they belonged.”
Entering this game, the Nittany Lions had only five senior starters, with two on offense, but there's normal depth at every position group, including an O-line that was paper thin through Franklin's first two years. Running backs Saquon Barkley and Miles Sanders are underclassmen, and four of the five leading receivers are juniors or younger. New coordinator Joe Moorhead's passing game currently ranks second nationally in S&P+.
“In camp, I thought we looked like a Big Ten team, in terms of depth, size and athleticism, but I've seen progress since I've got here. But no one recognizes progress until you have a win like this,” Franklin said.
4. Junior safety Grant Haley's game-winning touchdown on the blocked Ohio State field goal was almost a film session video for the ages.
“We watched the video on Sunday, and Haley's one of the fastest guys on our team. But he almost got walked down by their kicker and holder at the end of the run. I think he knew he would've never heard the end of it in the locker room if that happened,” Franklin said.
5. The whiteout has become one of PSU's best recruiting tools.
Franklin said around 180 recruits were in attendance, as the whiteout has become a recruiting tactic as much as celebration. The staff met with targets through Sunday afternoon, emphasizing the environment in Beaver Stadium.
“I think if you ask most of the guys on the roster now, they'll remember visiting here during the 4-OT whiteout vs. Michigan [in 2013]. They still talk about, because that type of game and environment stays with you. That's why I'm serious when I say that the fans were a part of the victory; it's more than just being loud.
“Obviously a win like this helps everything, but the stadium has a huge effect on people. It's a testament to the fans and the community and our team pulling in the same direction.”
Peter Kearney, director of the Scottish Catholic Media Office, said medical research showed there was a link between homosexuality and early death, arguing it was both “hazardous” and “harmful”.
He said there was a “conspiracy of silence” around the issue that prevented society facing up to it in the same manner as health problems such as smoking, drug abuse and obesity.
But gay rights campaigners accused him of “peddling nonsense” and said the church had sunk to a “new low” in its attacks on homosexuality.
The controversy broke out the day after SNP ministers decided to press ahead with legalising gay marriage and Philip Tartaglia, the Archbishop-elect of Glasgow, faced criticism for suggesting that a Labour MP's death was linked to his sexuality.
The current Bishop of Paisley, he yesterday added to the tension by denying reports he has agreed to meet the family of David Cairns, a former Scotland Office Minister who died of acute pancreatitis last year.
Dermot Kehoe, Mr Cairns' former partner, also rejected claims in some newspapers that the bishop had apologised for the remarks.
Instead Mr Kearney appeared to support the Archbishop-elect's claims by stating there was “a link between same-sex sexual practice and early death” that was supported by medical research.
“There has been, as was suggested by the questioner at that lecture, a conspiracy of silence around the vast array of medical evidence that exists to suggest that same-sex behaviour is hazardous, is harmful, and is dangerous,” he told STV's Scotland Tonight programme.
“The wider question really is, as a society, why don't we debate that? Why don't we look at it in the same way, for example, that we've been happy to look at how smoking, how alcohol, how overeating, how drug addiction can cause harms to people's health?”
He said medical studies showed that homosexual conduct shortens life expectancy by between 12 and 20 years because of “complex infections, diseases and illnesses”.
But Tom French, policy coordinator for the Equality Network, a gay rights group accused the Catholic church of making “ignorant and offensive claims”.
He said: “These baseless claims are not science – the so-called researchers simply read through obituaries in the American newspapers.
“The results have been repeatedly discredited and disowned by the worldwide health research community and the Catholic Church should stop peddling this nonsense.”
Archbishop-elect Tartaglia made his comments during a religious freedom conference at Oxford University in April but they only emerged this week, the day after the Pope appointed him to his new post.
Contrary to reports, it emerged last night that he will not meet Mr Kahoe unless he receives a request in writing. However a spokesman for the Archdiocese of Glasgow said he is “amenable” to holding talks after the “media storm” has passed.
Mr Kehoe doubted whether a meeting will take place and accused him of using a form of words that did not amount to a proper apology.
When Joel agreed to share his amazing and captivating story of how the bike saved him from taking his own life, I knew right away that this was going to be something that our readers would find so compelling.
I'm honored to present this very personal post by our newest Loving the Bike team member, Joel. He'll be an ongoing contributor on the site, and we're kicking things off with a big one. What Joel has accomplished over the past couple years has Made it Happen written all over it.
The Bike Saved My Life
by Joel Phillips
Every chance I have, I talk about how the bicycle gave me my life back and the joy it continues to bring. A couple years ago, I dropped a story on Loving the Bike entitled “Rediscovered Passion”. Darryl personally reached out to me because 1) He supports anyone that rides a bicycle, and 2) he liked my writing style.
In that story I paint a picture around the story of getting my first bicycle on my fourth birthday and how exciting it was because a whole new world of possibilities opened up for me. I went on to talk about how I grew older and the bicycle gave way to the car, and I became progressively fatter. I refer to a conversation with a couple of doctors resulting in me agreeing to take up riding my bicycle as my form of exercise. I talk about how a ride along the Platte River near downtown Denver ignited a spark and I decided to make it my life's work to get more people to ride bicycles. It's true what they say, there are two sides to every story and I am finally able to admit this is, and put it to rest.
Like Paul Harvey said, “and now…the REST of the story”.
I put my bike, a red Diamond Back Accent EX, circa 1987, into my truck and took it to work. There, I leaned it against a wall on the dock outside of my office window, where it sat for about three months. The intent was to ride it at lunch and get some type of cardio workout, but it was easy to always talk myself out of riding. I was 377lbs at the time, (3 1/2 years ago) I was doing the job I had when I first started in printing, back in 1989, (shipping & receiving). I had, and still have the same wonderful wife, but I was stuck in a miserable story that left me deeply depressed. Then one particularly “bad” Monday, I decided Tuesday I would ride my bike along the Platte River towards downtown Denver. So…that night I got everything ready for the ride at lunch the next day.
My wife left for work before I did, so we kissed goodbye and I gave her a little extra with the hug, I could see in her eyes she sensed something different. Charlie was in his bed, on a chair, in our bedroom window and I caught a glimpse of him as I tossed my backpack of stuff for the ride on the passenger seat of my truck. In the backpack there was nothing any cyclist would ever take on a ride. However this wasn't just any ride for me, I had decided it would be my last ride. In my backpack was a note of apology to all of those I felt I had hurt during my life, along with a loaded 9mm handgun. I was going to ride my bike to a secluded spot along the Platte River trail and end my life. I could see no other solution and just wanted the heartache and misery to end.
As I rode past Mile High Stadium and made the turn north where the path parallels Eltich Gardens (local amusement park) I remember feeling the burning in my legs as the trail went from flat to sloped, the water in the river seemed louder, making it's presence known. Then those feelings I had as a little kid, when I got my first bike, came back; not just bits and pieces, but like a flash flood. For the first time in a LONG time I felt alive! I could feel my heart pounding and my breathing was very heavy as I rolled my 377lb frame into Confluence Park. I stopped and took in what I was seeing, the Platte River and Cherry Creek converging, the Rocky Mountains towering above the horizon, beyond the cityscape. My bicycle had breathed the will to live back into my soul.
That ride along the river led to me taking charge of my life. I am not going to say life's been a downhill-ride ever since, because it hasn't…but I sure learned how to endure the climbs, and the views at the top are always spectacular. Today I am 274lbs, I rode in a multi-day bicycle tour through the mountains of Colorado, I became a certified ride instructor and most exciting, I am the founder of an organization that will deliver, and manage, a community-wide bike sharing system to Arapahoe County. Along the way I have made friends throughout the world and even discovered a couple of sisters I didn't realize I had…(wink, wink Krissy & Julie). To say the bicycle has left me touched, moved and inspired seems like an understatement; for it has also restored my integrity and opened my eyes not only to a new world of possibilities, but a world where anything is possible.
I don't pretend to have any of the answers, but I do know that if you keep pedaling you will get to where you are going.
Happy Riding my friends and please, share the joy you feel on your bike, it may just save a life.
Recently, my photograph was unknowingly taken while waiting in a queue, and later posted on Reddit under the subject "I'm not sure what to conclude from this". Now, I understand that being a baptised Sikh woman with facial hair might confuse some people. But I choose not to change my appearance because, in accordance with the Sikh tradition, I view my body as a gift from the Divine, as a tool for service, as a temple for my spirit.
I am well aware of how I am perceived by others: is she a man? A bearded woman? Transgendered? These perceptions find their roots both in simple curiosity and ignorance of the sheer diversity of the human race. I cannot stop people from forming convoluted first impressions based on what I look like, but I can stop them from turning that ignorance into misplaced assumptions or even hatred. This is why, having been alerted to the posting of the photo, I replied in the thread, and engaged with the posters discussing my appearance. What I learned from this experience is that building bridges between people isn't really that hard: an honest conversation, a simple exchange of meaningful words that make up our lives, can change people's opinions and change the world for the better – one step at a time.
JK Rowling's new book, Casual Vacancy, perhaps aimed to do just that. Her novel, which features a Sikh family and portrays them in a realistic way, required her to do extensive research into my faith. And with the attention that Casual Vacancy has been getting comes the chance to start a dialogue and open our minds and hearts to stories of people different than us, people we did not know about before, people, who, at a second glance, are just like us. Unfortunately, the novel enraged Sikh leaders in India, where it is currently the subject of protests over Rowling's portrayal of a Sikh girl teased for her body hair.
I hope those protests do not escalate. Violence and anger will only tarnish the image of peace-loving Sikhs, who in the past have only raised their swords when all other avenues have failed. Rowling's character sheds light on to a reality that the Sikh nation is still struggling to fully understand, acknowledge and accept: a reality of bullying, and superficial impressions. Why can't we, as a Sikh nation, write our own narratives and read them to the world through our actions, instead of protesting against the perceptions of the outside world?
This is why I have no problem with Rowling's description of a female Sikh being labelled as "mustachioed, yet large-mammaried" on page 120. Why? Because that's how most people perceive me. How I react to these perceptions defines my character, not the opinions themselves. I am a contradiction, at least physically, but I'm no different than any other college student – working hard to get into medical school to achieve our dreams.
So, have faith in our nation, Akal Takht. We Kaurs are strong enough to know that these words do not define us, but our actions and reactions do.
Radiohead's decision to play in Israel signals a disappointing turn for a band previously known for its antiwar stances. Yasuko Otani Wikimedia Commons
Fans, artists and activists around the world are urging Radiohead to cancel an upcoming performance in Tel Aviv.
The iconic UK band has so far ignored all appeals.
In an open letter published this week, activists with the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI) say that Radiohead's planned performance, “irrespective of intentions, will help Israel's regime of occupation and apartheid cover up its massive violations of Palestinian human rights.”
“Your performance in Tel Aviv will only help in the perpetuation of Israeli crimes against the Palestinian population generally and Palestinian artists specifically,” the campaigners add.
Two separate petitions circulated by Jewish Voice for Peace have garnered thousands of signatures so far.
Artists for Palestine UK, a growing coalition which supports the Palestinian boycott movement, also urged the band to cancel.
“Their gig will be at Hayarkon Park, built on the site of a Palestinian village ethnically cleansed by the Israeli army in 1948,” the group writes.
“Protests against Radiohead's appearance in a state which each week announces more seizures of Palestinian land are already growing,” the activists add. “Artists for Palestine UK will join them: Radiohead must not entertain apartheid in Israel. We remind the band: no one now regrets boycotting apartheid South Africa.”
Disappointing
To many of their fans, Radiohead's decision to play in Israel signals a disappointing turn for a band previously known for its antiwar stances and subversive, socialist distribution strategies.
Thom Yorke, the band's frontman, has in the past publicly denounced the US-led invasion and occupation of Iraq as well as the scourges of global capitalism and relentless environmental destruction.
However the band has been criticized lately for its reluctance to transform political statements into action, as the major music magazine Pitchfork asserted last year.
“Viewed harshly, Yorke and co. are wealthy English white guys who might occasionally recruit politics as an artistic catalyst, but who are unwilling or unable to divert time and energy to real political activism beyond an impassioned soundbite or appearance at a climate-change concert,” Pitchfork's Alex Niven wrote.
Serving Israeli propaganda
Israeli concert promoters are major players in the “Brand Israel” campaign, an Israeli governmental scheme to market a liberal image of the country in order to advance commerce and tourism, as well as to improve its international standing.
Promoters are specifically packaging Israel performances as gestures of humanist goodwill while deliberately downplaying or dismissing the BDS pressure prospective artists will face.
“The boycott has only marginal influence on artists, and the ones who do come here leave as goodwill ambassadors,” Guy Besser, a concert promoter, asserted to the Tel Aviv newspaper Haaretz.
However, in the same article, prominent promoter Shuki Weiss admits that the boycott is “causing us great harm” and its growth is “cumulative in people's perception.”
Weiss told Haaretz that he advises performers not to “engage in political discussions and come meet their fans here just like they do anywhere else.”
In 2011, Weiss told Israeli legislators that “the state must intervene” to combat the cultural boycott movement.
In the past, Weiss' company brought Radiohead to Israel but the Tel Aviv-based promotions company Naranjah is behind booking the band this summer.
However, Weiss has booked major rock bands the Pixies and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, both of which are scheduled to perform in Israel later this year.
The Pixies had previously respected the boycott call in 2010, canceling a performance following Israel's attack on the Mavi Marmara, which killed nine civilian activists and fatally injured a 10th as the ship sailed in international waters as part of an aid flotilla to Gaza.
But the band did play in Israel in 2014, ignoring pleas by BDS activists to cancel.
Growing cultural boycott
Radiohead's US-based publicist did not respond to The Electronic Intifada's inquiries.
Meanwhile, the cultural boycott of Israel continues to grow, despite the efforts by Israeli promoters to ignore it.
More than 1,200 UK-based artists and cultural workers have signed Artists for Palestine's online pledge to refuse to perform or exhibit in Israel and nearly 460 have signed a similar pledge in the US.
In New York City alone, nearly 300 artists have endorsed the cultural boycott.
Just weeks ago, professional US football players refused to take part in an Israeli propaganda junket, citing Israel's attempts to whitewash its crimes against Palestinians.
Seattle Seahawk Michael Bennett explicitly criticized Israel's intent to make him “an influencer and opinion former,” adding he “would not be used in such a way.”
His protest prompted other football players to follow suit.
Palestinian boycott campaigners are still holding out hope that Radiohead will cancel its July gig.
“As it says in the video of your song All I Need, ‘some things cost more than you realize,'” PACBI states.
“Your performance in Tel Aviv will cost us dearly as it will help to prolong Israel's decades-old occupation, colonization and entrenched system of apartheid that denies us our equal rights by law, not just policy.”
Twitter users are also appealing to Radiohead to cancel their planned performance:
Hey @Radiohead, #Israel is using you to lie that its oppression is normal. Please respect the boycott, cancel https://t.co/2xasUI8TA6 #BDS — Jinjirrie (@Jinjirrie) February 20, 2017
Shameful. Do not cross the human rights picket line. Would you have played South Africa during apartheid? — Carlos Villarreal (@carloshuman) March 6, 2017
Immensely disappointing!! Thought you had more brains & ethics enough to not play for apartheid! We call you to join boycott #BDS — Dima Sarsour ديمة (@YasminWaQahwa) February 9, 2017
Centralia today (all photographs by the author)
When you think of American ghost towns, it's likely that you picture a crumbling Wild West outpost. However, in the middle of Pennsylvania, there's a town that disappeared far more recently. In many ghost towns, it's the collapse of an industry that caused people to leave. In Centralia, it was the industry itself that resulted in this abandoned town.
Centralia was a quaint town of over 2,000 residents in Columbia County, Pennsylvania. The large coal deposits below the ground helped turn Centralia into a bustling business center in the early parts of the 20th century. All was well until 1962, when an exposed seam of coal caught on fire during a routine trash burning at the landfill.
Sign for Centralia
Over the next two decades, several attempts were made to put out the underground fire, but the its virtually unlimited source of fuel made the attempts futile. Citizens of Centralia knew of the fire, but it wasn't until 1979 that its extent was fully understood by residents and scientists. It was a local gas station owner who discovered the fire's true danger when he measured the temperature of his underground storage tanks at 172 degrees — 100 degrees higher than normal.
A few years later, a young boy was swallowed by a large sinkhole caused by the mine fire and was lucky to survive. That incident, the increasing number of sick residents, and the rising levels of carbon monoxide spelled the end for Centralia.
Over the next few decades, more and more local residents moved from Centralia. As the population decreased, buildings were torn down until almost nothing was left.
Today, only a handful of buildings and residents remain in Centralia. What was once a bustling town is now eerily quiet.
Empty streets
A stop sign for no traffic
As you drive along the streets, it becomes harder and harder to tell that a town once stood there: forests have reclaimed the land, remnants of sidewalks buckle beneath expanding roots, stairs lead nowhere, and sidewalks have crumbled. At a few intersections, lonely stop signs feel out of place without traffic.
No visit to Centralia is complete without a stroll down the abandoned Route 61. Stretching about three quarters of a mile, this destroyed section of road has been given the nickname “The Graffiti Highway,” because it is covered in tags and drawings. Some of it is insightful, and some is art, but a significant amount is less than family-friendly.
“Welcome to the Graffiti Highway”
Remains of Route 61
Roughly mid-way along the abandoned road is the best evidence of the destructive forces of the fire burning below. Like a scene from a post-apocalyptic movie, a large crack has torn its way through the highway. It was this crack that necessitated the entire highway be rerouted to avoid massive repair bills. Today, having been left untouched for many years, it's a great place to understand the power of the forces below Centralia.
Amidst all the destruction, evidence of the town's past still remains on the outskirts of town. At Centralia's three cemeteries, grass is still mowed and some graves show signs of visitors. A small park in town still holds Centralia's time capsule. Buried just a few short years after the mine fire was started, it's due to be opened in 2016, perhaps giving the town one last hurrah.
Abandoned trash can
The last remaining church in Centralia
The future of Centralia is unfortunately no brighter than its present. Scientists estimate that there may be enough coal underground to burn for 250 more years, ensuring that no one will return to rebuild Centralia in the short term. However, a sliver of hope can be found along the hillsides above Centralia. In an area destroyed by mining there are now wind turbines producing clean energy for the surrounding community. Maybe it will be clean energy that becomes the legacy of this forgotten coal town.

Quarterback Cam Newton is preparing to lead the Carolina Panthers in pursuit of their third consecutive NFC South title. The Panthers kick off their 2015 NFL season on Sunday when they visit the Jacksonville Jaguars.
But last week, Newton took time to respond to commenters on an Instragram photo who said it seemed gang-related and made Newton look like a "thug."
"D1FFERENT FATHER, D1FFERENT MOTHER, SAME STRUGG1E WE HUST1E THEM MY BROTHAs" -1OVE A photo posted by Cam Newton (@cameron1newton) on Sep 3, 2015 at 8:55am PDT
Newton posted the photo on Thursday. It showed the former Auburn star with friends on a trip to Mexico for the quarterback's most recent birthday. The photo drew enough comments in the vein of inquiring whether it showed the "Panther Crips or Bloods," criticizing Newton for allegedly throwing up a gang sign with his hands and predicting his suspension by the NFL that Newton responded.
Newton, who is making a "W" for his high school alma mater, Westlake in the photo, responded with another Instagram post on Friday. This time, Newton and his friends are shown dressed in suits, and Newton included a caption in which he quotes Muhammad Ali and the Joker.
"Is this picture better for you simple-minded people," Newton wrote, "who are quick to judge something/someone when you are not better than the next person? Something to think about. Two pictures. Same people in both pictures. What do you see or what do you want to see?"

State Budget Deal KSNV coverage of the final verdict on Nevada budget, June 1, 2011.
Related Document (.pdf) Details of the budget agreement
Sun Coverage Sun politics coverage
CARSON CITY — Big business will emerge from the 2011 Legislature paying no more in state taxes than they did before the session began.
Teachers and administrators, meanwhile, will take pay cuts totaling 7.5 percent; higher education and state workers will take a 4.8 percent pay cut in the form of furloughs; and social services will be cut.
Since Republicans were fighting to keep taxes low and Democrats were seeking to fund government services, including schools and universities, who do you think won the legislative endgame?
In a deal announced Wednesday, Gov. Brian Sandoval and Republicans extended for two years taxes passed in 2009 to fund a budget that contains pay cuts and layoffs for public employees and cuts to social services.
Over the next two years, the state will spend $6.77 billion — about $313 million more than Sandoval had originally proposed. It's a number that despite its significant size is only a few percentage points higher than Sandoval had proposed, an amount Democrats railed against as devastating.
In exchange for Republican votes to extend the taxes, Democrats bucked their union allies, agreeing to support significant changes to education policy — making it easier to fire teachers — and collective bargaining, which dictates how local governments negotiate with unions.
As Tray Abney, lobbyist for the Reno-Sparks Chamber of Commerce, which has consistently opposed taxes, put it: “They (Democrats) traded long-term permanent reform for two years of temporary taxes.
“My big guys will be paying the same, and all my little guys will be paying nothing,” he said, referring to the payroll taxes, which will be unchanged on larger businesses and eliminated for the 70 percent of businesses with payrolls of less than about $250,000 a year.
Rusty McCallister, lobbyist for the firefighters union, said, “We'll be back here in two years doing exactly what we did: More permanent reforms for temporary taxes.”
Democrats' universal defense was this: It was the best they could do under the circumstances.
“About a week ago, the proposal was to give gaming and mining a tax break,” said Senate Majority Leader Steven Horsford, D-North Las Vegas.
Democrats had the majority in both the Assembly and Senate, but lacked the two-thirds majority in each house required to pass a tax. On top of that, they had Sandoval, newly elected on a pledge not to raise taxes. He held fast to that decision until last week, when the Nevada Supreme Court issued a ruling, calling into question some of the local government money grabs contained in his budget.
Democrats saw the defeat coming. So they began early to frame many of the reforms they would agree to as their own. They did this despite the fact these issues — education and collective bargaining reforms — antagonized their base of union members and advocates for greater spending on government services.
“I think our education reforms make a lot of sense,” Assembly Speaker John Oceguera, D-Las Vegas, said.
Horsford noted that Senate Democrats pushed many of these reforms in 2009. “The overwhelming majority of teachers and the public support these reforms,” Horsford said. “They get to the heart of student achievement.”
But Republicans drove the reform efforts further than Democrats would have wanted.
The groundwork for Wednesday's deal was laid in November, when state Senate Democrats lost a seat to a conservative Republican and failed to get the two-thirds supermajority. When longtime state Sen. Bill Raggio retired in January, a moderate voice for compromise on taxes, that set it in concrete.
Wednesday's news conference was the predictable end: Sandoval stood at a lectern with Democratic and Republican leadership and about 40 of the 63 lawmakers.
Both sides tried to portray the agreement in a favorable light. Sandoval used some creative math to distract from the fact he had acquiesced to the Democrats' spending and broken a campaign promise not to extend the 2009 tax increases. (He highlighted that general fund spending would drop to $6.2 billion, but another $500 million will be going to fund schools directly.)
Still, even though Sandoval accepted the Democrats' overall spending plan, lawmakers were forced to make significant cuts. College and university students will have to pay higher fees, faculty and staff will take a pay reduction. K-12 personnel will be asked to take a 2.5 percent pay reduction plus see 5 percent their salary diverted to their retirement. And Clark County School District says about 500 people will be laid off.
Democrats faced an uphill battle on taxes — in their view, the game is rigged against tax reform because of the two-thirds required to pass a tax increase, or override a veto from the governor. They had little hope of winning enough Republican support to pass the new taxes they introduced this session to broaden the tax base and raise a total of $1.2 billion over two years.
“The most important reform didn't get any serious consideration. And that's tax reform,” Sen. Sheila Leslie, D-Reno said. “But unless the governor will stand up and lead on this we are never going to get anywhere.
“It's the tyranny of the minority. The only way to get at that is at the ballot box.”
Yet, even on that point, Democrats failed to win a concession from Sandoval. He would not agree to sign a bill that places a binding question on taxes directly to voters.
Oceguera said they likely will send him a bill anyway, even if it means a certain veto.
If Democrats are unable to override Sandoval on that issue, teachers and labor groups are saying they will collect signatures to put a tax increase in front of voters.
“Voters will have a say if legislators don't act,” Horsford said.
Despite their victories, not all Republicans were happy with the deal.
Many voiced frustration that Sandoval chose to broadly interpret the court's ruling that the state couldn't take $62 million in user fees from the Clean Water Coalition. Sandoval believes that ruling calls into question $656 million in local money grabs that he included in his budget.
The interpretation spurred outrage from conservative operatives, an indication Leslie says proves Democrats “didn't lose everything.”
As a result, not all Republicans are expected to vote for the compromise budget despite the fact their leaders won the desired policy concessions from Democrats.
Sen. Michael Roberson, R-Las Vegas, said he won't support the deal.
“My strong belief is that the Supreme Court decision creates an unexpected $62 million liability for the state,” he said. “That's easily managed without the sunsets. We can't make decisions based on hypotheticals or the fear that someone is going to sue us. You can't be afraid to make tough decisions for the state.
“There will be at least one no vote in the Republican caucus.”

VANCOUVER—Asked whether he's aware that right fullback was something of a sore spot for the Vancouver Whitecaps last year and Sheanon Williams flashes a polite smile.
Williams, a 26-year-old whom the Whitecaps acquired via trade from the Houston Dynamo in December, arrived in Vancouver intent on providing some stability where none was found last year. After the Whitecaps sent Steven Beitashour to Toronto FC prior to last season, their 2016 Major League Soccer campaign featured a mix of Fraser Aird and Jordan Smith in the position, both of whom struggled and are no longer with the team.
“I knew coming in that right back was an issue here,” Williams told Sportsnet during the team's first day of camp in Vancouver. “It doesn't really put pressure on me. I've been around the league. This is my eighth season, and I was brought in to try to help, and try to lock that down, so that's what I'm gonna do.”
Williams “had a little bit of an inkling” that he might be dealt from Houston, the second MLS club he'd represented after starting out in Philadelphia. The Boston native has the gracious manner of your typical professional athlete—that is, he'd rather not talk about anything too controversial.
“Listen, I'm just excited to be here,” he said when asked about the tough season the Dynamo endured last year (the team underwent upheaval when coach Owen Coyle departed in May and finished the season at the bottom of the Western Conference with a record of 7-14-13).
Houston had a rough go of things in 2016, but then again, so did the Whitecaps, who finished eighth in the West with a record of 10-15-9.
The Whitecaps allowed 52 goals last year, good for second-worst in the West behind the Portland Timbers, who allowed 53 (though the Timbers did finish above Vancouver in the standings with a record of 12-14-8). Vancouver's once-lauded defence often looked disjointed, and over the summer, central defender David Edgar was brought on in the hopes that he would be the vocal on-field presence the team needed to help organize the back line. With Edgar injured as a result of a hit-and-run last month and out until September, it's natural to wonder just who will step in and take on that leadership presence now.

Williams, who has 192 MLS appearances under his belt, is viewed as a workmanlike right fullback with the ability to go forward.
“I'm someone that likes to work hard,” he said when asked to describe what fans in Vancouver should expect of him.
The goal, he said, is to make an impact on the back line—to “hopefully turn this defence into one of the best.” That, plus making the playoffs this year.
“I'm excited to be on a team that's headed in the right direction,” he said. “I think last year was a tough year for the team, and I hope that we can turn that around and get back to where we need to be.”
His transition north of the border has been helped by a number of Whitecaps who happen to be former teammates: Jordan Harvey, Andrew Jacobson and Giles Barnes. Barnes, who was traded from Houston to Vancouver last summer and who has been surrounded by rumours of a potential transfer to Blackburn Rovers (now managed by Coyle), had spent the most time with Williams over the course of his first few days in the city.
“It's always been one of my favourite cities to visit,” Williams explained. “The team's always been tough to play against, and coach Robbo does a good job with the guys here. I'm excited to be a part of that and to be a part of it for a lot of years.”
While Williams insists he feels no pressure, that's not to say that he'll be able to rest easy. With the seventh overall pick in this year's MLS SuperDraft, Vancouver selected right fullback Jake Nerwinski, a six-foot, 22-year-old out of the University of Connecticut. The New Jersey native, who is still unsigned, somehow came off both excited and relaxed during Vancouver's first day of camp, and he got the start during the team's first pre-season friendly in Wales on Friday, a 1–0 loss to Cardiff City FC's U-23 squad. Williams sat out with what was described as a “small injury.”
Still, pressure or not, Williams's excitement for a chance at a fresh start with a new team was obvious in his first day in Vancouver.
“I'm excited to be alongside some other great defenders that we have on the roster right now,” he said. “I think it's gonna be great.

It's a great pleasure to announce Oskar Guilbert, Criterion/EA/Ubisoft veteran and founder/CEO of DONTNOD Entertainment – the studio behind the hit episodic drama-adventure Life Is Strange – as a keynote speaker at the Nordic Game conference next month.
Guilbert will take the stage in the Unreal Theatre with a talk entitled “From AAA Boxed Games to Digital and Episodic”, delving into DONTNOD's transformation from a traditional AAA boxed games developer (Remember Me) to a studio firmly focused on episodic and digitally delivered titles (Life Is Strange).
Guilbert will also share his experiences and insights in terms of content, production, distribution and customer feedback integration at DONTNOD, and how the studio has succeeded despite several preconceptions: That there's no place for mid-range games, that the good characters are always male, that going episodic means losing money, and that episodic production is a nightmare.
As a bonus, Guilbert will also reveal details about the highly anticipated Episode 3: Chaos Theory of Life Is Strange, which will very likely be released during the conference. (Update: Publisher Square Enix has confirmed that Episode 3 will be released on 19 May).
Here's a teaser from the upcoming game to whet your appetite:
Excited yet? DONTNOD CEO and industry game-changer Oskar Guilbert – another great reason to join us for Nordic Game 2015, 20-22 May in Malmö, Sweden. Register today!
In an era of slick gadgets, PCs are the dinosaurs, ensnared in wire clutter, sporting tired 2D cameras and stricken with the occasional blue screen of death. Technology coming up in 2015, though, is set to make PCs more interactive, fun and perhaps nosier than you'd like them to be.
Apple's iPad changed the way people viewed computers and spurred PC innovation. Hardware makers drew ideas from mobile devices, gaming consoles and even 3D printers to rethink the PC, and the resulting new technologies will have a profound effect on how laptops and desktops are used next year and into the future.
Perhaps the most interesting idea is Intel's “wire-free” PC, in which wireless technology will replace display, charging and data transfer cables. chipmaker Intel next year will show an experimental laptop that has no ports, and relies completely on wireless technology to connect to monitors and external storage devices.
Interactive computers will have 3D cameras that behave more like eyes, with the ability to recognize objects and measure distances. Sensory input through sound, voice and touch will help PCs respond to and anticipate our needs.
And like every year, PCs will get thinner, faster, lighter and have longer battery life. Games and movies will look smashing with higher-resolution displays. The new technology, however, will come with a price.
Here are six disruptive technologies that could change the face of computing in the next year:
Wireless charging
Place a laptop on a table, and it'll automatically start charging. No wires needed, no need to carry a power brick. That's how Intel views wireless charging for laptops, which could become a reality next year. Intel wants to make wireless chargers as easy to find as a Wi-Fi signal, and wants to bring the technology to cafes, restaurants, airports and other public places so laptops can be recharged without power adapters. The first laptops with wireless charging could come out next year, and Intel has shown a few prototypes laptop being recharged on a table.
An Intel laptop charging wirelessly.
Intel is backing the Rezence magnetic resonance wireless charging technology, promoted by the Alliance for Wireless Power, or A4WP. The power flow will initially be limited, enough to wirelessly recharge ultraportables and hybrids. Plans call for increased power output to recharge mainstream laptops. But getting the technology to public places and entertainment spots could take some years. Some cafes and restaurants already provide wireless charging bases for tablets and smartphones, and are interested in adding laptops to the mix.
Beam the image, Scotty
It may also become possible to connect laptops wirelessly to displays, which could eliminate expensive HDMI or DisplayPort display cables. A wireless display will start working as soon as a laptop is within range. Intel envisions a laptop ultimately being able to connect to multiple wireless monitors, which could be useful in classrooms or meetings. One laptop will be able to stream to monitors on multiple desks. Intel is pushing the initial idea through a “smart dock” that connects a laptop to a wireless monitor.
An Intel booth dedicated to various wire-free technology implementations.
Wireless displays will gain momentum with the growing adoption of WiGig, a faster version of Wi-Fi that can handle wireless 4K video streams without any lag. In addition to Intel, Qualcomm will bring WiGig to smartphones and tablets next year, so users will be able to stream Netflix directly from a smartphone or tablet to a wireless TV. Display makers will also build WiGig technologies into monitors and TVs in the coming years.
Creative desktops
From its origin as a dull white box, the desktop has become a hub of creativity and imagination, with technologies like depth-sensing cameras and 3D printing spinning off a variety of innovations.
HP's Sprout PC.
One example is HP's Sprout, which looks like a normal all-in-one PC, but packs the latest imaging and collaboration technology. At the base of Sprout is a giant touch pad called a Touch Mat, which is a dual-purpose digital canvas on which images can be scanned and also manipulated. A 3D depth-sensing camera lodged in Sprout scans the objects placed on the Touch Mat—for example, if a coffee mug is placed on the canvas, the 3D camera will scan it to depth and size. A projector on top of Sprout can then reflect the scanned image of a coffee mug on the Touch Mat, which artists can then manipulate by touching the digital canvas. HP says the scanning and manipulation could be useful for creating objects that could be 3D-printed. But at $1,899, Sprout is considered an expensive experimental desktop.
Otherwise, Dell has developed a “smart desk,” with an all-in-one PC beaming a virtual keyboard onto a desk on which users can type. It's an interesting concept, but a proper keyboard may be a better idea.
Interactive computers
Computers will become more perceptual with a combination of gesture, voice and visual recognition technologies being installed in PCs.
Intel's RealSense 3D depth-sensing camera in action
Starting next year, 2D cameras in PCs will be replaced by Intel's RealSense 3D cameras, which will be able to recognize objects and even measure distances between items. The camera's Kinect-like gesture recognition capabilities will also make PC gaming hands free and interactive. Intel has lofty goals, aiming to combine visual, voice and sound input to recognize human moods and reading habits. While those won't happen in the coming year, the 3D camera will certainly make Skype chats more fun.
Biometric sensors
Soon, your body could log you into an email account.
A fingerprint reader on a Lenovo Thinkpad T430s laptop
By the end of this year, Intel will be providing software so users can log in to websites via biometric authentication. It serves two purposes: biometric authentication is relatively reliable and secure, and users won't have to remember dozens of passwords for different sites. Apple already uses biometric authentication to authorize credit card payments through its Apple Pay service, and Intel wants to bring a similar concept to PCs. Expect the fingerprint reader to become more useful starting next year.
Thinner, faster, lighter, better
Laptops, tablets, hybrids—with so many options available, buying PCs isn't easy, and it won't get any easier next year with more innovative designs set to become available.
Agam Shah Intel's 'Llama Mountain' prototype tablet, powered by one of the company's Broadwell processors, measures just 7.5mm thick and runs Windows like a champ.
Computers will get thinner as PC makers introduce laptops that are as thin as 15 millimeters. Computers will offer longer battery life with the new Broadwell and Skylake processors from Intel and Carrizo chips from Advanced Micro Devices. New DDR4 memory will make applications and games run faster in desktops. Next year, Microsoft's Windows 10 OS will replace the controversial Windows 8. Expect the OS to take advantage of these new technologies.

We've mentioned and discussed Nvidia's Volta graphics processor many times already. You know, with the V for Vendetta Volta. Website mydrivers has gone into a bit more detail on the actual release, it might be announced already in Q3 under the GeForce Series 20 naming.
Historically Nvidia does release their new architecture GPUs closer towards the end of the year so that would be a match. What also helps is that the overall graphics card sales have dropped a bit, hence for Nvidia is makes all the more sense to release a new architecture.
So the latest rumor now is that NVIDIA GeForce Series 20 would be released in Q3 this year. It remains under a lot of speculation though as to how the GPU is fabbed, or better yet on what fabrication node. We've heard 16nm, 12n and 10nm but that last one seems to have been scrapped. Hence we think that Volta might be a GPU series fabbed on 16nm Finfet in the latest revision or at best TSMC's new 12nm node.
Then as most of you know, Volta should get HBM2 memory. Here again things remain speculation, it seems HBM2 is a tough thing to fab in good quantity (look at VEGA for example). Considering Nvidia is incredible flexible in these things, honestly GDDR5X would not sound weird to us.
Back in February a GPU called GV100 was already spotted in AIDA, with hardware Device ID 1D81. It might very well be that Nvidia already has working engineering samples.

He's gone from “Rude” to lewd.
A Staten Island indie pro-wrestler who goes by the ring name “Rude Boy Riley” has been busted on child-porn charges, law enforcement sources said.
James “Rude Boy” Riley, 28, of Arden Heights was arrested Wednesdaymorning after police executed a search warrant and discovered child pornography hoarded on his computer, sources said.
He faces charges of promotion and possession of a sexual performance by a child, sources said.
The tattooed, 6-foot-1, 208-pound wrestler often competes with Warriors of Wrestling and Five Borough Wrestling, according to a bio on his personal website.
“With his high energy, platinum-blonde bun and tattoos honoring his mom and grandfather. James Riley is the local favorite,” his bio reads.
Riley, who has been wrestling for about a decade, is quoted in his bio saying, “'Everyone who doubted me as a kid is now watching me in the crowd.'”
Riley is also a group trainer at Staten Island's Orangetheory Fitness gym.
An employee at Orangetheory Fitness told The Post, “We have no comments to be made.”
Gym-goers who know Riley were stunned by the news.
“James is spunky, energetic and always helpful,” one gym-goer said. “I seriously can't even fathom this.”
When reached by phone Wednesday, Riley's mother said, “Yeah, we have no comment,” before hanging up.
His arraignment is pending.

Absolutely sickening. Absolutely sickening.
SOCCEROOS coach Holger Osieck's right to pick A-League players will disrupt the penultimate round of the local competition because of FFA's regular fixtures clash.
With the A-League competition destined to be on a knife edge before the play-offs, Osieck must be ruthless when he names his squad for a 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifier to face Oman on March 26 at Stadium Australia.
But Football Federation Australia's A-League scheduling is not making Osieck's task any easier - the competition continuing to clash directly with FIFA's international match calendar.
Osieck has no choice but to unsettle the competition, with national team regulars Mark Milligan and Archie Thompson (Melbourne Victory) and the Sky Blues' Brett Emerton likely to be named.
Osieck may even tip-toe, giving opportunities to fringe A-League Socceroos such as in-form Adelaide United pair Eugene Galekovic and Dario Vidosic.
Call-ups for Central Coast Mariners gloveman Mat Ryan, Melbourne Heart's Eli Babalj and Richard Garcia and Brisbane Roar's Jade North and Ivan Franjic may rip the heart out the competition before finals.
Galekovic said he wouldn't hesitate to join Osieck's Socceroos for the Oman World Cup qualifier after the Reds gloveman had a solid East Asian Cup tournament in Hong Kong in December.
"(Reds reserve keeper) Paul Izzo would get a chance (if I get called up)," Galekovic said.
"Hopefully, he'll do the job but when you get called up for the Socceroos, you have to take it."
The fixtures dilemma has been with the A-League since it started in 2005 and the FFA has always clashed with some FIFA fixtures.
FIFA has provided an international calendar so national federations can avoid players' country versus club clashes.
Australia needs to finish at least second in its group to qualify directly for Brazil.
A third place finish will put the Socceroos into World Cup play-off territory.
The Socceroos are second on five points, eight points behind leader Japan and one point ahead of Jordan at the bottom of Group B.

In an interview with BBC's Tom Brook, singer/songwriter James Taylor reveals how he met John Lennon‘s assassin Mark David Chapman the day before the murder on December 8, 1980. “His assassin had buttonholed me in the tube station…He pinned me to the wall, glistening with maniacal sweat, and tried to talk in some freak speech about what he was gonna do, and stuff about how John was interested and how he was gonna get in touch with John Lennon. It was surreal to have contact with the guy 24 hours before he shot John.”

Also: check out Tom Brook's Lennon piece that aired on last night's BBC World News America . It includes interview bites from Taylor, Bono, Yoko Ono, John and Yoko's son Sean Lennon, and, interestingly, the doctor who attempted to resuscitate Lennon at Roosevelt Hospital the night of the shooting.
Ho-Ley Shitsnacks. I had the luck of being paired with one of the most generous gifters ever. Thanks ChiliPepp3r, I am blown away.
First off, I opened Rex: Final Days of an Empire. This is a great addition to my collection. I don't have any games quite like it, my board game group is going to be stoked. I have heard great things about it. In fact, after I opened it I may or may not have made a strange mix of an excited squeek and what can only be described as the mating call of a moose (sorry upstairs neighbors). I can't wait to read the instructions and get a game going.
As if that wasn't incredible enough, I also received the first Cards Against Humanity expansion. I am sure this will lead to many more nights of drunken fun that ends in laughing until tears are shed.
So once again, thank you ChiliPepp3r for being mind-bogglingly awesome!
Young Christians in the Middle East march in protest against persecution by ISIS. (AP Photo)
(CNSNews.com) – The Knights of Columbus, along with In Defense of Christians, released a comprehensive report Thursday documenting eyewitness accounts of Christians who have been killed, kidnapped, raped, or sold into slavery at the hands of ISIS.
The report was presented to the State Department Wednesday.
Knights of Columbus CEO Carl Anderson said at a National Press Club briefing that the evidence contained in the report as well as other evidence “fully support and, I suggest to you, compel the conclusion that a reasonable ground exist to believe the crime of genocide has been committed against Christians in the region.”
The deadline for Secretary of State John Kerry to state the administration's stance on the matter, as required by the omnibus spending bill passed last December, is fast approaching.
Kerry has until March 17 to declare whether “the persecution of, including attacks against, Christians and people of other religions in the Middle East by violent Islamic extremists” constitutes genocide.
“History will record the recent atrocities committed against religious minorities in the Middle East as genocide,” Anderson said. “The question is whether America will be remembered as courageous as in the case of Darfur or as something much less so as in the case of Rwanda.”
The report documents the deaths of 1,131 Iraqi Christians between 2003 and June 9, 2014. It contains 24 pages of witness statements collected between February and March 2016, and documents attacks, including attacks on 125 Iraqi churches from 2003 to 2014.
The report also contains a legal brief arguing that the crimes committed meet the criteria of the Genocide Convention Implementation Act of 1987 and the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.
“This is not a case of precipitous action,” Anderson emphasized, pointing out that “the European parliament, various national governments, legal experts, religious and civil leaders and genocide scholars and candidates of both political parties here in the United States, including former Secretary of State Clinton, all have called what is happening to Christians in the region genocide.
“But what are we to say of the prospect that the U.S. State Department would find itself standing apart, standing apart from this emerging world and national consensus?” Anderson asked.
Anderson told reporters that the request for the fact finding report provided to the State Department came four weeks ago from Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom David Saperstein.
“Why the State Department has not conducted its own investigation in the region I don't know,” Anderson said during the question and answer session, “for example the State Department under Secretary Powell sent as many 24 experts to investigate the situation in Darfur.”
“For the United States government to stand alone in denying that this is genocide would be shameful and an abdication not just of leadership but of cooperation and common sense,” Anderson concluded. “Should the State Department not provide the equivalent of an indictment of ISIS genocide we fear that it will be the State Department itself that will face the indictment of history.”
Bishop Anba Angaelos, general bishop of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, Egypt, for the UK, spoke on the National Press Club panel as well, calling for an inclusion of Christians in any genocide designation by the State Department. He said he fears that “people will see that the international community has supported one group against another and they will see that other as fair game.”
“If Christians are excluded from the classification of genocide, my concern, my fear, my expectation is that we will be responsible for a greater and more ruthless campaign of persecution not only in that country but in the region,” Angaelos said.
The bishop asked how Christians could possibly be excluded from the designation “if they are suffering the same fate at the same time at the hands of the same perpetrators under the same conditions.”
“What's happening in the Middle East and in Syria is criminal and is an indictment of our humanity if left unaddressed,” he concluded.
Dr. Gregory Stanton, research professor in genocide studies and prevention at George Mason University, also called on the State Department to use the word “genocide” to describe the persecution of Middle East Christians by ISIS.
“Why are we waiting to use the word?” Stanton asked. “I'll tell you why, because the word packs moral force, and it requires action, and what we have here is a case where the administration is not ready to make the determination, because it is not determined to do what is necessary to really stop ISIS with the full force that it needs to do.”
You are here: Real Psychic Experiences :: Misc :: Sleep Paralysis and 333
Real Psychic Experiences
What can I say, I'm posting on here and must admit I am scared. I had had a lot of these attacks every now and then when I go to sleep. I never sleep with the lights off anymore and these attacks still happen. I know it sounds crazy but I'm sure it's demons trying attacking me.
I will fall sleep and wake up unable to move and either sense a dark presence hovering over me or, one of the worst episodes last saturday, I could swear I felt this evil being hugging me, not letting me go, as I slept on my couch on my side. Usually these attacks happen when I sleep on my back.
And for the last 2 years I have noticed that I will look at digital clocks and it says 333. Also I have just been baptized into Jesus. But the first ever attack I had was before I knew ANYTHING about Christ. All I can think is I am prideful inside and maybe that's why these attacks are allowed to occur. I know I sound cowardly because I'm a guy but I'm really scared. I don't know how to stop these attacks and know when I go to sleep, I won't have to worry.
And if you think it's all in my head I know it's not because unfortunately, my mom had an episode once. She said she saw a dark winged being hovering over her bed. And that is what scared me the most because there is nothing more I fear than my mom losing her soul. The Bible says believe in the Lord and your whole house shall be saved. Well my parents do not believe in Christ, my father is outright opposed. And I am an only child and I'm scared my parents and I will be separated eternally. I know I have struggled inside to get myself right with God and I believe if I don't completely surrender, which I am trying, that not only I'm but my parents, will be lost eternally. I don't know what to do.
All I know is to be a true follower of Christ you have to completely give up your self will and truly die to yourself. That's the only reason I can think these attacks are allowed to happen.
IDEAS H.W. Brands teaches history at the University of Texas at Austin. His latest book is Reagan: The Life
For 30 years Ronald Reagan has been a hero to Republicans and conservatives, his presidency regarded as the crucial moment when America began to turn back from the misguided liberalism of the New Deal to the truths of individual liberty and personal opportunity on which this country had rested from its founding. Yet as much as those on the right have revered Reagan, they have been unable to recapture his magic and repeat his success. The Reagan Revolution has had no second act.
The reason for this is that Reagan's accomplishment has been widely misunderstood. Reagan is remembered for his compelling vision for America: a vision of self-reliance, limited government, stout defense, and world leadership toward freedom. And he is remembered for his ability to communicate this vision, better than anyone else of his generation or after. In a long political career, Reagan gave hundreds of speeches, but all were riffs on the single theme of expanding liberty. There is nothing of substance in any of Reagan's speeches that doesn't resonate today with nearly everyone right of center, from mainstream conservatives to Tea Party activists.
Yet Reagan was more than a speechmaker, more than a visionary. He was also a brilliantly successful politician. Reagan had no military experience—beyond performing in films for the army during World War II—but he instinctively understood the difference between strategy and tactics. His strategic goal was to shrink government at home and defeat communism abroad. (On the latter he memorably told Richard Allen, who became his national security adviser: “My theory of the Cold War is: We win and they lose.”) But Reagan recognized that progress came in stages, and that a step forward was a step in the right direction, even if it didn't achieve the goal all at once. “If Reagan told me once he told me fifteen thousand times,” James Baker, Reagan's chief of staff and later his Treasury secretary, recalled in an interview: “‘I'd rather get 80 percent of what I want than go over the cliff with my flags flying.'”
In case after case, Reagan demonstrated the flexibility necessary to advance his conservative agenda. He called for cutting taxes, and he was astonishingly successful in doing so, reducing by half the top rate on personal income. But he was willing to accept slight tax increases when necessary to consolidate gains already made and to achieve other conservative goals, such as streamlining the tax code and putting Social Security on a sounder footing. His willingness to accept less than his maximum program similarly made possible broad deregulation of business and a landmark immigration reform act.
Reagan is often cited as an enemy of government. The most frequently quoted line from his first inaugural address has him saying, “Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.” But what is almost always omitted is the prefatory clause: “In this present crisis…” Reagan was not an enemy of government, and he did not think government was the enemy of the American people. He believed government should be smaller than it had become by the 1980s, and that it should be more efficient, but he didn't believe it should be dismantled. As Greg Leo, who served in the Reagan administration told me, “We were not anarchists; we were conservatives.”
Reagan's tactical flexibility appeared in other arenas. He was famous for declaring the Soviet Union an “evil empire.” He had no doubt that communism was the most pernicious of modern creeds, and that the Kremlin was, as he put it in the same speech, “the focus of evil in the modern world.” Reagan directed the rebuilding of American defenses to combat communism and bolster freedom. Yet even as he built up arms, he sought ways to negotiate them down. Indeed, the purpose of the arms buildup was to make arms reductions possible—to convince the Russians they couldn't beat the United States in an arms race.
Reagan repeatedly sought to engage Soviet leaders in negotiations, to no initial avail. “They kept dying on me,” he said of the Moscow gerontocracy. But the emergence of Mikhail Gorbachev gave Reagan someone to negotiate with, and in the culmination of an unprecedented series of summits, Reagan and Gorbachev eliminated one whole class of nuclear weapons and laid the basis for dramatic additional cuts in the superpower arsenals. Visiting Moscow during his last year in office, Reagan was asked whether he still considered the Soviet Union an evil empire. “No,” he said simply. Later prompted to explain, he acknowledged that even communists could change for the better. “There is quite a difference today in the leadership and in the relationship between our two countries.”
Reagan brought another crucial attribute to conservatism. Righteous indignation, at times amounting to anger, has often characterized the conservative movement. From Barry Goldwater to the Tea Party, many conservatives have seemed to like feeling beset and aggrieved. Reagan could get righteously angry, as when the Soviets shot down a Korean airliner in 1983. “Words can scarcely express our revulsion at this horrifying act of violence,” he declared.
But anger wasn't Reagan's natural mode. He was an optimist at heart, and in every speech he conveyed his belief that America's best days were ahead. Goldwater frowned and warned; Reagan smiled and invited. Reagan's philosophy differed hardly at all from Goldwater's, but Reagan's vote-getting power surpassed anything Goldwater could muster. Reagan genuinely believed America was a “shining city on a hill,” as he said again and again, and he made Americans believe it, too.
Reagan refused to demonize his foes. Instead he charmed them, with a few exceptions, including Tip O'Neill, the Democratic Speaker of the House and the embodiment of the liberalism Reagan sought to reverse. Reagan conspired in the impression that he and O'Neill shared a bond that transcended political differences, but it was an act. “Although photographs taken after their meetings suggested a sort of underlying Irish camaraderie between the two men, the reality was that they were hammer and anvil,” said Donald Regan, of Irish descent himself, who served as Reagan's Treasury secretary and then chief of staff. After one meeting with O'Neill, Reagan told Regan, “I don't know what the hell's the matter with the man. I just can't seem to reach him.”
Reagan reached most other people he encountered. He didn't point fingers; he told jokes. He understood, from years on the lecture circuit, the disarming value of humor: that getting people to laugh with you is halfway to getting them to agree with you. He used humor more effectively than any president since Abraham Lincoln. Reagan was not an especially warm person, but he appeared to be. Many people disliked his policies, but almost no one disliked him.
Reagan's enduring value as a conservative icon stems from his resolute preaching of the conservative gospel, in words that still warm the hearts of the most zealous conservatives. Yet Reagan's value as a conservative model must begin with recognition of his flexibility in the pursuit of his conservative goals. He understood that the point of politics, ultimately, is not to make speeches but to make progress, and that progress often requires compromise. It's a lesson for today's conservatives—and reformers of any stripe.

Where have I seen that profile before? That's right. The new Kershaw Natrix is based on brother brand Zero Tolerance's 0770, which itself was inspired by the award-winning ZT 0777. The design has—apparently—been the envy of certain other knifemakers. And now we're taking it back.
Kershaw's new Natrix features a drop-point blade of 8Cr13MoV that offers solid performance with good edge-holding and easy resharpening. The stonewashed blade finish looks good and even helps hide use scratches. Accessed with the built-in flipper, SpeedSafe assisted opening makes it easy to open the Natrix one-handed so it's always ready when you need it. The handle is lightweight G-10, 3D-machined and chamfered to fit comfortably in the hand. An oversized pivot provides an attention-grabbing detail on the front of the knife, while our patented Sub-Frame Lock secures the blade and provides a dramatic, contrasting line on the back.
The Sub-Frame Lock design also enables us to lighten the weight of the Natrix, so that you get a big, useful blade in a knife that still weighs in at a mere 2.9 ounces. A decorative aluminum backspacer lightens the load even further and adds another embellishment. Finally, a custom-designed deep-carry pocketclip echoes the lines of a special recess machined into the handle to complete this good-looking knife. The manufacturer's suggested retail price for the Natrix is $59.99.
Now the next time you see this famous knife profile, it will be from a manufacturer that has a right to the design: us.
Release Year: 2017
The Kershaw Sub-Frame Lock is covered under US Patent 9,120,234.
Sessions
The speakers addressed a wide variety of subjects: from "classical" development over marketing to community topics. The main focus this year were topics about agile strategies and tools regarding devops, deployment and development processes. Community related topics gave insights into the (possible) collaboration between open source projects, diversity and the TYPO3 Association.
Schedule
Each session block started with teaser talks about the upcoming sessions. This helped the participants to decide which talk will meet their skill level and expectations best. Between the sessions there was much time to discuss topics, to socialize or to work on the code.
Coding Night
Working on the code was also the motto of the first evening: The CODING NIGHT. The focus of this open end evening is to get things done and to onboard new contributors. One main topic this time was to work on the relaunch of the typo3.org website. Work was done productively until 02:00 a.m. in the morning.
Party on!
The evening started with taking a group picture and a nice swedish dinner. And then the motto was only: "Socialize and party!" The highlight of the evening was the election of the "Best dressed developer": Daniel Diesenreither.
What's next?
Stay tuned for the announcement of the upcoming TYPO3 Developer Days in 2018, register yourself and enjoy the event next year.
What's last?
Without the sponsors such an event would not be possible, so we would like to thank especially the premium sponsors dkd.de, jweiland.net and platform.sh.
It's been just over seven months since Geoff Collins took over the reigning American Athletic Conference champions from Matt Rhule, and many wondered what the future would hold for the Temple Owls.
There are a lot of unknowns when a new head coach takes over a program that just came off its first major conference championship in school history and has been two been straight title games. Rhule brought a level of hard work and excitement that drew recruits to Temple. Geoff Collins promised to continue that tradition, and after a slow start to the recruiting process, the Owls are beginning to understand what Collins is all about.
The Owls first recruiting class under Collins was underwhelming. That is to be expected when a new coach takes over just weeks before National Signing Day. Even with the limited time to reach out to players once committed to Rhule, he made headlines by using a helicopter to visit recruits and the introduction of the S.W.A.G. Coordinator. He has made an impression on players who are considering coming to North Broad with his use of social media and his pedigree of former players who have made it to the NFL.
With that said, Temple had just one committed player in their 2018 class heading into June. Since June 11, Collins has received commitments from seven players, and five of them came within 72 hours of one another. Collins clearly made an effort to attract as many local talents as possible as all eight commits come from the Mid-Atlantic region.
The Owls landed four three-star recruits, headlined by Amir Gillis, a local product from Philadelphia's Simon Gratz High, and Ronnie Stevenson, a 6-foot-5 wide receiver from Montour High School in Mckees Rocks, Pa. Gillis had offers from Akron, Buffalo and Kent State, but chose to stay close to home shortly after receiving an offer from Temple. Stevenson was drawing some interest from Pitt and Penn State, but the cherry and white were the only school to offer him a scholarship.
Collins' calling card has been on defense and that's where Chauncey Moore, a defensive back from Friendship Academy in D.C., and linebacker Daesean Winston from Archbishop Spalding in Severn, Md., will look to make their mark. Winston had several Mid-American Conference teams after him, including Bowling Green, Buffalo and Central Michigan. Moore was sought after by both service academies and a handful of FCS schools as well, but will leave the D.C. area to play his football in Philly.
Temple also picked up a pair of two-star linemen in Christian Barmore (Neumann Goretti, Philadelphia) and Jean Paul Rodriguez (Lakewood, N.J.). Rodriguez is considered a two-way player along the line, while Barmore is the latest area talent to stay in the City of Brotherly Love.
Rounding out Temple's current 2018 class are Antonio Colclough, a defensive back from Cardinals Hayes in Bronx, N.Y., who accepted his offer less than a week after attending Coach Collins' football camp. Elijah Clark, was the Owls' first commit in April. He is a cornerback from Sayreville War Memorial in Parlin, N.J.
Rivals.com has Temple's 2018 class currently ranked 61st in the nation, tied for fourth best in the AAC with UCF and behind Houston, SMU and Cincinnati. That's already a big jump from the 2017 class that was ranked last in the conference and 118th nationally.
The Owls remain in the running for several other recruits, including Trad Beatty, a dual-threat quarterback from Columbia, S.C. Jermaine McMillian, a defensive back from Booker T. Washington, has narrowed his list down to six schools, including Temple, and several Southeastern and Big 12 Conference programs.
There is still plenty of time for Temple to land more talented prospects to round out his first complete recruiting class. It's also still early in the process for other schools to pluck players away from G5 proframs. A lot could change before everything is all said and done, and we will learn how successful Collins' recruiting tactics have been come next February.

YELLOW SPRINGS, Ohio — Dave Chappelle is urging progressive policing in his southwestern Ohio hometown, where questions have been raised about police tactics at a New Year's Eve celebration.
The comedian spoke at a meeting Monday in Yellow Springs, where he and other village residents listened to a review of police behavior. Residents have complained about the use of a police cruiser to disperse the crowd and police handling of stun guns that night.
The Dayton Daily News reported that hundreds of complaints about what critics called heavy-handed tactics at the celebration led the police chief to resign.
“Huge gaffe New Year's Eve,” Chappelle said, after saying expressing appreciation of the police departing, saying that on at least two occasions officers had protected him.
"Given what the culture of our town is like, council has a tremendous opportunity to be a leader in progressive policing, Chappelle said.
The New Year's Eve celebration is like a reunion and usually free of problems, according to Yellow Springs News.
“In all fairness, the crowd was drunk … because it was New Year's Eve,” Chappelle said, drawing laughs from those attending Monday's council meeting. “And I left early, because nobody felt completely right. So I am trying to be balanced and fair.”
The incidents that night have drawn national attention after a New York Times report.

Chappelle said one reason the events drew the New York Times' attention was that the paper's travel editor was a Yellow Springs native. At the time, he said, residents in the small community knew police officers personally and they were part of the community.
"Now we are being policed by what feels like an alien force," Chappelle said.
Chappelle said in his remarks that the village council should take a "golden opportunity" to prove local governments matter when searching for a new chief and to become a leader in progressive law enforcement.
"In this Trump year, this is an opportunity to show everybody that local politics reigns supreme," Chappelle said.

North Korean traffic girls, in their uniforms deigned by the Great Leader, with their unfailingly robotic movements and riveting focus, are becoming figures of cult status. Instead of traffic lights to control the stop and go flow of an intersection, women dressed in perfectly crisp and identical outfits stand alone in the middle of intersections in a small circle (or on a platform with an umbrella for shade). They are only allowed to turn counter-clockwise, directing traffic with forceful, halting movements. They have wonderful uniform variations for rain and winter. They've been the subject of photographic study since at least the 1970s, have the website Pyongyang Traffic Girls dedicated to them (with Traffic Girl of the Month; here's March), a growing catalog of user submitted YouTube videos, and at least one Flickr photo pool. Are they sexy? Strangely, yes. Are they efficient? Frightfully so. Do we have our Halloween costume now? Most certainly.

Social media giant Pinterest is due to launch a financial aid scheme to help employees cover the cost of adoption and surrogacy.
The new scheme will come into effect from 1 July. It was prompted by an employee in a same-sex relationship who is seeking surrogacy.
Employees of the San Francisco-headquartered company will receive a reimbursement of $20,000 (€14,782.01) towards surrogacy costs.
Alternatively, $5,000 (€4,460.50) will be reimbursed to couples who are going through the adoption process.
Pinterest parenting
Candice Morgan, head of inclusion and diversity at Pinterest, said in a blog posting: ‘Diversity and inclusion are woven into the fabric of our culture. As our organisation grows, so do the needs of each employee, including those starting families.'
She went on to say that it was from a discussion with an employee about the challenges he and his husband were facing in extending their family that prompted the change.
‘Our People team often speaks with employees to learn more about how we should expand our benefits, and we recently spoke with a colleague who's been looking into surrogacy with his husband.
‘The high costs associated with surrogacy were raised, and we began looking into how we could help him, and others in similar situations, ease the financial burden.
The company also provides up to 16 weeks paternity leave and up to $20,000 for fertility benefits.
HR expert Aliya Vigor-Robertson from JourneyHR, told GSN: ‘It's promising to see Pinterest listen to what their staff want and create a more formal approach to innovative benefits, which not only gives employees clarity around what to expect but enforces its message of creating an inclusive and diverse culture.'
I know we're all thinking about the environment and how everything is going to pot. We have heard over and over again that the consequences of our actions are sure to create more extreme weather patterns and disrupt local climates—climates that humans, animals, and plants have depended on for centuries. But what can you do about it right now?
Refrain from drinking pre-bottled water. The carbon emissions from the production and transport of bottled water are astounding. First you have to harvest the water, which requires machinery, which emits carbon. Then you have to make the bottles, which are plastic. Then you've got to transport this heavy water all over the world. And at the end of it all, you have an empty bottle that will probably wind up in the the middle of the ocean. Instead, use your local tap water. If you don't trust it, buy a Brita filter. And carry local water with you in your own bottle so you don't wind up having to buy bottled water when you're thirsty. Consider buying carbon offsets. Everyone knows that flying across the country in an airplane is one of the absolutely the worst things you can do for the environment. But if you need to fly, there really is no alternative. So why not pay a minimal fee to offset your footprint. The money you pay to offset your trip will go back to helping the environment. Cut back on the beef consumption. Even if you substitute chicken for beef once a week, you'll be making a difference. Cattle require a lot of water, food, and land—and they naturally release a lot of methane. It doesn't take a lot to make that burger a turkey burger.

Inside the MLS:
Thomas Rongen
Dutch international Thomas Rongen – whose footballing career is a product of his hometown club Ajax Amsterdam – was appointed the new TFC Academy director prior to the start of this season. Representing RedNation Online, I recently caught up with Rongen right after TFC Academy's senior squad outplayed London City at Downsview Park, beating London by a whopping score of 6-0 in Canadian Soccer League play. Rongen (who played in the United States from 1979 to 1993) discussed with me Toronto FC's vision of bringing over the Ajax youth system, the 4-3-3 and the possibility of Dutch Total Football working in Toronto.
RedNation Online: Mr. Rongen, first of all, congratulations on the big victory. I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised because I know a lot of these guys from London City and a lot of them played at a pretty high level in Europe. Do you think that, with all the effort, money and time put into TFC Academy, we can expect more wins like this? Are you surprised as well?
Thomas Rongen: No, I'm not and I feel that we're only scratching the surface. Actually, I think that some of our younger teams are even better than our senior team. Saying that, we're playing against good competition in the CSL. We've changed the make-up of the team a little bit. It's more of an under-23 team as we've got some 20 and 21-year-old players that help our younger talented players more. You know, gradually. We should actually be 3-0 in league play. We lost last weekend, we should have won that game as well so I feel that this team will finally be able to compete not only against this team here (London) but against the better teams of the CSL's first division just like our under-17 team will compete for first place in their division. It's just a by-product I think of good coaching, the continuation of believing in our vision, playing the 4-3-3, playing attacking, aggressive technical football – which I think we displayed today. We scored some goals, we scored more goals, we were dominant and we were a better technical team. I think fitness was an issue too for the opponent. Again, our training of four times a week helps us in games and it's going to help us in tight games as well. Overall, I'm very pleased by the performance and we're only going to get better. Sergio Camargo is still injured, Tyler Pasher wasn't part of this team today due to suspension so as I said, we'll be adding better players even in the future. That's going to make this team better but to me it's more about how we approach the game, how we play the game, how we manage the game and at the end of the day, are there one or two players out here that eventually can make the jump to our first team. That's really the exercise, for me, more than anything else, to be able to recommend to our first team coaching staff as to which players are ready to make the jump. When we can surround these talented players with other talented players, you get good results. I think winning on this level is important and I think we're clearly heading in the right direction – we're far from being there but it's a good start of the season for all of our teamsild.
RNO: TFC Academy came out with a 4-3-3 today and clearly, it worked. Do you want to continue with the 4-3-3? Is the 4-3-3 something that you want to play against every team or does it depend on how the other team comes out of the gate?
That is a lot of borrowing for a team that lost $70 million last season and had faltering attendance.
The team's financial state is serious enough for Wilpon and Katz to be courting minority investors — a hunt for a cash crutch that is nearly a year in the making — to raise $200 million.
All this is happening without the financial grease that once made the Mets' finances so much easier: profits from Wilpon and Katz's decades of investing with Bernard L. Madoff. They lost $550 million when Madoff's Ponzi scheme unraveled three years ago; they face a possible trial next year over claims by the trustee for his victims that they turned a blind eye to signs that Madoff was up to no good, which they deny.
“It seems inconceivable they're going to hold onto the team for the long term when you look at the incredible hurdles they face in 2014 and 2015,” said Howard Megdal, author of an e-book, “Wilpon's Folly,” in which he details the financial pressures on the team.
Mets officials declined to speak about the team's debt or to discuss Megdal. They issued a statement that said, “We do not publicly address specific issues pertaining to our finances including inaccurate, speculative and ongoing fabrications.”
Sports business experts say that the five-year term of the loans on the team and SNY is standard and that the team could refinance and extend them when they are due. But the Mets' actions — adding debt and seeking investors to buy 10 shares in the Mets for $20 million each — raises questions about whether they can generate enough cash to make all their payments, especially if the team does not rebound on the field.

Robert Leib, a financial consultant to sports teams who have examined numerous balance sheets, said that debt was not necessarily a problem, even if it is to finance operating losses, as long as the value of the team is increasing. At least, then, banks and owners know that loans will be repaid through the sale of the team.

But Leib, who has not seen the Mets' books, said, “If what you're doing is taking down debt to handle operating losses with the knowledge that you're inadequately capitalized from the get-go, then it's toxic.”
Baseball expects teams to use debt — Commissioner Bud Selig approves all loans — but sometimes, they pile up more than they can bear. M.L.B. also sets limits on borrowings, called the debt service rule, and nine teams were out of compliance with it this year, according to The Los Angeles Times.

Chuck Greenberg, who led a group with Nolan Ryan to buy the Texas Rangers last year, said the debt rules were “fairly stringent,” but there were “creative ways to exploit” them by spinning off entities from the franchise, like ticket or real estate arms, “that are not subject to the debt limits on the team itself.”
For the Mets, a team with a new ballpark, debt should be no more than 12 times its cash flow, according to a formula in the new labor agreement. But with the Mets' financial records private, there is no way to know for certain if they are breaking the debt rule.
But teams can face breaking points. Too much debt pushed the Rangers into bankruptcy last year. Too little cash sent the debt-ridden Los Angeles Dodgers into bankruptcy last June.
“If all three of your core assets — team, media and stadium — are encumbered with bank debt or bond obligations, it limits your agility and makes problem-solving more of a challenge,” Greenberg said.
Despite setting a ceiling on debt, M.L.B. can be selective in how it enforces the rule. Selig found it easy to push Tom Hicks to sell the Rangers because he had defaulted on $525 million in loans to the Rangers and the Dallas Stars. Selig engaged in a long-running battle with the Dodgers' owner, Frank McCourt, who had engaged in financial and personal conduct Selig judged to be detrimental to the team and to baseball, and cajoled him into agreeing to sell the important franchise.
But he has indulged Wilpon, a friend and ally for 30 years. Unlike McCourt, Wilpon has tried to find minority partners to resolve his continuing cash crunch. So Selig has not installed a monitor to oversee the Mets as he did with McCourt. Selig has in the last few months witnessed the collapse of a deal to sell one-third of the Mets to the hedge-fund wizard David Einhorn, the failure of the Mets to repay baseball's $25 million loan on time, and the slow pace of the sale of the 10 minority shares.
Selig may never tell Wilpon he has to sell. But Selig could be waiting for banks to grow so concerned that they demand that Wilpon sell the team he has owned, outright since 2002, to recover all they are owed.

“Bud would leave the dirty work to the banks,” said one banker who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “It would be easy for him to ask Fred's bankers, ‘How's that loan going?' ”
What seems hard to understand is where the Mets' owners will get the money to keep up with their debt payments, finance their losses and pay the Madoff trustee a substantial sum through a settlement or a jury verdict. Next season, with lower ticket prices and the prospect of attendance falling further, revenue may tumble again. And the availability of a free luxury suite to all 10 potential minority owners suggests the team cannot sell premium seating at perhaps $200,000 each.
One source of financing — barring additional bank borrowing — is coming from within Sterling Equities, the parent company of the Mets. Recently, $40 million became available to buy two more of the minority shares. All of it went to offset losses, said two people familiar with the team's finances.
You know, sometimes the jokes write themselves. The Pontiac Silverdome, home of so many failed Detroit Lions teams, was slated for demolition early Sunday morning … and somehow, even the destruction of the Silverdome didn't go smoothly.
Explosive charges that detonated at 8:30 a.m. ET were supposed to destroy the metal support columns that held up the highest reaches of the stadium, which in turn was supposed to send those sections collapsing to earth. Only, it didn't quite happen that way. Those steel support beams remained standing after the smoke cleared.

Press release explaining what *was* supposed to happen w the Silverdome implosion today. pic.twitter.com/snDFbtpNdP — Allie Gross (@Allie_Elisabeth) December 3, 2017
We won't speculate on what might be the next step if the upper sections don't come down, but we assume air strikes aren't out of the question. The city has planned to spend the next year demolishing the stadium in various stages and cleaning up the site, but it's unclear how the demolition will proceed with this little setback.
The Silverdome hosted the Lions and Detroit Pistons, as well as the fabled Wrestlemania III (Hulk Hogan vs. Andre the Giant!), Pope John Paul II's mass in 1987 and concerts ranging from Led Zeppelin to Elvis Presley to Madonna. The San Francisco 49ers beat the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl XVI at the Silverdome, and several 1994 World Cup matches took place there. Most recently, the stadium served as a filming location, hosting productions ranging from the independent film “Silverdome” to the megabudget “Transformers: The Last Night.”
Story continues
It's easy to dump on Detroit, so let's take a more positive view. Rather than a logistical failure, let's cast this as a success, a demonstration of Michigan spirit and strength and willpower. That old stadium's too tough to take down! Yeah, that's gotta be it! Just … just don't get your hopes up too high and wander too close to those unsupported upper decks, OK? We wouldn't push optimism that far.
The Silverdome refused to fall. (Screen shot)

Slideshow: Newsweek's most iconic covers Courtesy of Newsweek A look back at some of the most memorable Newsweek covers from the past 80 years. The weekly magazine is going completely digital, and as of 2013 will no longer produce printed issues. Launch slideshow
At the end of the year, there will be an empty space on the newsstand once occupied by Newsweek magazine.
The venerable news weekly, 80 years in publication, announced Thursday that it will publish its final print edition on Dec. 31. Beginning in the new year, it will go all-digital, a sign of the rapid shift in readership to online via tablets, smartphones and desktops.
In an announcement posted Thursday on The Daily Beast, which merged with Newsweek two years ago, the news weekly said the online publication will be called Newsweek Global. It "will be a single, worldwide edition targeted for a highly mobile, opinion-leading audience who want to learn about world events in a sophisticated context" and will require a paid subscription.
The joint statement from editor-in-chief Tina Brown and CEO Baba Shetty said a challenging print advertising environment was the motivation behind the move. Newsweek said it was seeking to take advantage of the swift growth in the use of tablets, online and e-readers.
"Tablet-use has grown rapidly among our readers and with it the opportunity to sustain editorial excellence through swift, easy digital distribution...." the statement said.
Getty Images The cover of Newsweek International for the week of August 2, 2000. The venerable magazine, 80 years in publication, will publish its last print edition in the U.S. at the end of the year and go all-digital.
"This decision is not about the quality of the brand or the journalism—that is as powerful as ever. It is about the challenging economics of print publishing and distribution," the statement added.
The statement said Newsweek expected reductions among its editorial and business staff in the U.S. and overseas, but did not give a specific number.
Barry Diller, the head of the company that owns Newsweek, had announced in July that the publication was examining its future as a weekly print magazine.
Newsweek has been able to build a growing online audience, in part due to the popularity of devices such as Apple Inc's iPad and e-readers from Amazon.com Inc and Barnes & Noble Inc.
That growth has led Newsweek to a "tipping point" where it is most effective to distribute the publication exclusively through digital means, Brown and Shetty wrote.
The Daily Beast gets more than 15 million unique visitors a month, up 70 percent from a year ago, with much of that growth generated by Newsweek, they said.
Industrywide, U.S. magazine advertising pages fell 8.8 percent in the first half of 2012, according to Publisher's Information Bureau data. Newsweek fared better; its ad pages rose 7.6 percent during that period.
But Newsweek's U.S. circulation has been in decline for years, falling from a one-time peak of around 3 million to about 1.5 million now.

The book - brought to the attention this week of those on the "Moms Against Duncan - MAD" Facebook page , goes on to say white Americans were hesitant to vote for a black president, and that Obama pushed the race issue to bring the nation together.
DUPO, IL - Fourth graders in Dupo Illinois are reading a biography of Barack Obama that's raising eyebrows among St. Clair County parents. The book, which supplements the school's Common Core curriculum, blames television for the negative behaviors the first African-American president picked up as a teen:
"But some people said Americans weren't ready for that much change. Sure Barack was a nice fellow, they said. But white voters would never vote for a black president. Other angry voices were raised. Barack's former pastor called the country a failure. God would damn the United States for mistreating its black citizens, he said."
The Bluffview Elementary students were told the book's content would be tested for grades. That brought outrage among parents just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, one of the "MAD" moms reported.
This biography of America's 44th president, entitled "Barack Obama," is written by Jane Sutcliffe and published by Lerner. The book is part of Scholastic's "Reading Counts" program acceptable to the controversial Common Core curriculum standards.
An online sampling to "Barack Obama" is available HERE.
As to the "Moms Against Duncan" (MAD), which formed on Facebook to pushback on U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan's recent comment about "white suburban moms" and their resistance to the national Common Core curriculum standards, here's what one of the MAD moms wrote this week about Duncan and Common Core:
"Duncan's foot-in-mouth-disease comes from the fact that he doesn't understand that this is no longer a political thing. This is about our children. As a teacher who left the classroom because of Common Core and the abuse of our children, I can promise it has nothing to do with color, or sex, or education level, or income, or political party. As a Democrat myself I will be voting all over party lines in November. If you support Common Core….we will show you the door. There are a lot of Dems who have signed onto Harkins bill, which will effectively remove all local boards of education, and they need to watch their re-election bids carefully.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel said on Sunday it would not remove metal detectors whose installation outside a major Jerusalem mosque has triggered the bloodiest clashes with the Palestinians in years, but could eventually reduce their use.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his security Cabinet on Sunday evening. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he would halt security ties with Israel until it scraps the walk-through gates installed at entrances to Al-Aqsa mosque plaza after two police guards were shot dead on July 14.
Netanyahu's right-wing government is wary of being seen to yield to Palestinian pressure over the site, which Jews revere as the vestige of their two ancient temples. It was among areas of East Jerusalem that Israel captured in a 1967 war and annexed as its capital, in a move not recognized internationally.
“They (metal detectors) will remain. The murderers will never tell us how to search the murderers,” Tzachi Hanegbi, Israeli minister for regional development, told Army Radio.
“If they (Palestinians) do not want to enter the mosque, then let them not enter the mosque.”
Incensed at what they perceive as a violation of delicate decades-old access arrangements at Islam's third-holiest site, many Palestinians have refused to go through the metal detectors, holding street prayers and often violent protests.
Reuters witnesses reported some light clashes between Muslim worshippers and Israeli security forces after prayers at the entrance to Jerusalem's Old City on Sunday night. Palestinian medical sources did not report any serious injuries.
The spike in tensions, and the deaths of three Israelis and four Palestinians in violence on Friday and Saturday, have triggered international alarm and prompted the United Nations Security Council to convene a meeting for Monday to seek ways of calming the situation.
Washington sent Jason Greenblatt, President Donald Trump's special representative for international negotiations, to Israel on Sunday evening in hopes of helping to reduce tensions, a senior administration official said.
“President Trump and his administration are closely following unfolding events in the region,” the official said. “The United States utterly condemns the recent terrorist violence.”
Two Jordanians were killed and an Israeli was wounded in a shooting incident on Sunday in a building inside the Israeli embassy complex in Jordan's capital, Amman, police and a security source said.
Details of what happened were unclear. Israel imposed a ban on reporting the incident and made no public comment.
Jordan has seen an outpouring of public anger against Israel in recent days, with Jordanian officials calling on it to remove the metal detectors at the Al-Aqsa mosque.
ABBAS ULTIMATUM
The spasm of violence began on Friday, when Israeli security forces shot three demonstrators dead, Palestinian medics said. Israeli police said they were investigating the charge.
On the same day, a Palestinian stabbed three Israelis in the occupied West Bank after vowing on Facebook to take up his knife and heed “Al-Aqsa's call”.

A Palestinian was killed in the Jerusalem area on Saturday when an explosive device he was building went off prematurely, the Israeli military said. Palestinian medics said he died of shrapnel wounds to the chest and abdomen.
On Sunday, a rocket was launched into Israel from the Gaza Strip, but hit an open area, causing no damage, Israel's military said.
Abbas, referring to the metal detectors in a speech on Sunday, said: “If Israel wants security coordination to be resumed, they have to withdraw those measures.
“They should know that they will eventually lose, because we have been making it our solemn duty to keep up security on our side here and on theirs.”
Gilad Erdan, Israel's public security minister, warned of potential “large-scale volatility” - a prospect made more likely in the West Bank by the absence of Abbas' help.
Erdan said Israel may eventually do away with metal-detector checks for Muslims entering the Al-Aqsa compounds under alternative arrangements under review. Such arrangements could include reinforcing Israeli police at the entrances and introducing CCTV cameras with facial-recognition technologies.
“There are, after all, many worshippers whom the police know, regulars, and very elderly people and so on, and it recommended that we avoid putting all of these through metal detectors,” Erdan told Army Radio, suggesting that only potential troublemakers might be subjected to extra screening.
Any such substitute arrangement was not ready, he added.
The Muslim authorities that oversee Al-Aqsa said, however, they would continue to oppose any new Israeli-imposed measures.

“We stress our absolute rejection of ... all measures by the Occupation (Israel) that would change the historical and religious status in Jerusalem and its sacred sites,” the Palestinian grand mufti, acting Palestinian chief justice and Jordanian-run Waqf religious trust said in a joint statement.
Turkey also urged the removal of the metal detectors and the Arab League said Israel was “playing with fire”.

Last week, I attended MSU's Fifth Annual Conference on Innovation and Communications Law, where I saw a wonderful presentation by Joshua Pearce, an engineering and material sciences professor from Michigan Tech, on “distributed open-source digital manufacturing” (a.k.a. open-source 3D printing). The hardware Joshua presented is called RepRap:
RepRap takes the form of a free desktop 3D printer capable of printing plastic objects. Since many parts of RepRap are made from plastic and RepRap prints those parts, RepRap self-replicates by making a kit of itself – a kit that anyone can assemble given time and materials. It also means that – if you've got a RepRap – you can print lots of useful stuff, and you can print another RepRap for a friend…
I love conferences that bring lawyers together with technologists, because they really help the lawyers among us understand what's at stake for developers of new technologies that intersect—maybe “collide” is the better word—with intellectual property law. Joshua's presentation ended with a plea to the lawyers in the room to prevent IP law from inhibiting the development and proliferation of open 3D printing technologies, which promise to revolutionize—maybe “disrupt” is the better word—our entrenched, centralized, and outsourced manufacturing model.
I don't know what the patent landscape looks like for the machines and methods underlying 3D printing, but from the copyright perspective, distributors of 3D printers are almost certainly insulated from secondary liability for infringement by Sony v. Universal, a seminal Supreme Court case from 1983 holding that the manufacturers and distributors of reprographic technologies that can be used to infringe copyrights are exempt from liability for the infringements of end users if the technologies they distribute are “capable of substantial non-infringing uses.” The Supreme Court later clarified in MGM v. Grokster that Sony's safe harbor will not protect distributors who operate with the proven intent to induce end users to infringe, even if the technologies at issue have substantial non-infringing uses. What Sony means for distributors of 3D printers is that they will not be liable for the copyright infringements of end users as long as they don't encourage users to print copies of copyrighted works, including, for example, sculptures, toys, or useful articles of industrial design that incorporate copyrightable expressive elements. The technology itself is therefore safe from copyright law and from copyright injunctions prohibiting distribution.
The trickier question with 3D printers involves liability for direct infringement by end users. No one doubts that 3D printing will proliferate unauthorized copying of copyrighted works. The controversial question is what the law should do about that proliferation. The migration of 3D printing technology from the lab to the home is underway right now, and it will likely accelerate quickly given that RepRap is designed to be both low-cost and self-replicating. By happenstance, that migration coincides with the initiation of a comprehensive legislative review of U.S. copyright law, making this an opportune moment for policymakers to revisit the legal status of copying for personal use. Under our current system, copying for personal use arguably falls under the rubric of fair use, but that's far from a foregone conclusion, even with respect to established technologies. The issue has been further complicated over the years by an increasingly expansive interpretation of what counts as a commercial (and therefore market-harming) use of a copyrighted work. Under that expansive interpretation, every unauthorized copy—even a copy made only for personal use—is viewed as commercial in nature because it theoretically represents a lost sale for the copyright owner. Restoring the eroded definitional boundary between copying for personal use and copying for commercial gain would be a step in the right direction for copyright reformers. For a lucid and still-very-timely consideration of how the law of copyrights should treat personal copying, see Jessica Litman's article “Lawful Personal Use” from the Texas Law Review (2007).
The Western world is like an exclusive club when it comes to technology. Everyone knows the big tech players, but we tend to forget the rest of the world spins just as much as our part of it. There's a plethora of other manufacturers which make amazing Android products!
We have put together a neat list of phone makers that mainstream consumers in the West likely don't know a thing about. Most of us are tech geeks around here, so many of you have probably heard the names and may be familiar with some of these, but we also know plenty of our readers would like to improve their knowledge on some more obscure companies. Get ready, because you are in for an interesting ride!
Xiaomi
If you keep up with our feed (or any other tech website's), you have probably heard of Xiaomi. This company is often referred to as “the Chinese Apple”, thanks to its quick rise to the top, but also a certain inclination towards Apple's design language. It happens to be #2 in Chinese smartphone shipments in China, only falling behind Apple. The issue is most Western consumers have no clue about these phones, as these can't really be found at any regular store.
Xiaomi is taking an approach most of the market is not familiar with. They save millions in marketing by resorting to mostly promoting their devices via social media and word of mouth. Another way Xiaomi saves money is by making sure demand is always higher than supply. They have no extra inventory laying around, making their losses much smaller in the long run.
The Chinese manufacturer then transfers the savings to you, the customer. This translates to amazingly affordable devices that offer quite the bang for your buck. Very few competitors get even close to Xiaomi in terms of specs relative to price. Sadly, we have yet to see them really hit the USA, but they are coming. And when they get here, they will definitely leave a mark.
Some of their most recent devices include the Xiaomi Mi Note Pro, Xiaomi Mi 4i. Just read our Xiaomi device reviews to find out what these phones are really like – these are truly impressive.
Meizu
Meizu is a main competitor to Huawei and Xiaomi, taking one of the top spots among the biggest manufacturers in China. They accomplished this in a very short period of time, as the company was only established in 2003. Just like Xiaomi, Meizu is known for making great devices that keep your wallet relatively healthy.
The manufacturer is responsible for devices like the Meizu MX5, M2 Note and MX4 Pro, which are all great handsets with very low price points. The only issue is they are only big in Asian markets and it will probably take some time before they reach the USA (if they do). You could have the devices imported, but not many customers will opt for such inconvenient measures.
Regardless, Meizu is definitely a company you should keep your eyes on. All these Chinese manufacturers are about to change the tech world as we know it, and Meizu wll be one of the main ones to join the party.
OnePlus
You are really out of the loop if you read Android Authority on the regular but haven't heard of OnePlus. Though they are a very new startup, these guys are the kings of social media and the affordable market. They are known for hyping up their devices to no end, but the main difference is that they actually have something to tout, as opposed to just making a blast about gimmicks.
The OnePlus One smartphone was priced at only $300 when launched, yet it came with specs that could put most $600-$700 phones to shame. Internals include a 5.5-inch 1080p display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor, 3 GB of RAM, 16 GB of internal storage (64 GB for the higher-end version) and 13/5 MP cameras, all packaged in a strong body with a solid design.
Honestly, at that price it's likely still the best phone you can get. Now we know what this Chinese startup can do, and they are coming in for round two. The OnePlus 2 hype train has taken off and it's not stopping! This is definitely a manufacturer you want to keep an eye on, as they do cater to the American market. Through an invite system, but at least you can actually buy a OnePlus smartphone.
OPPO
We have to give props to OPPO. They may not be too popular outside of China, but they can put together awesome smartphones that are actually innovative. They were the first to become “selfie kings” with a rotating camera, and their amazingly thin OPPO R5 and R7 are gorgeous.
The guys at OPPO have made a habit out of breaking the rules left and right, but they always do it in the right ways. I would say we need more manufacturers like OPPO, willing to be creative, stay smart and take risks.
We were actually at their Shenzhen offices and factory once and you can learn all about that in our dedicated post. Or you can just watch the video embedded below!
LeTV
You probably haven't even heard of LeTV if you live outside of China, but this doesn't mean they are a small player. In fact, this company runs the biggest online video company in their home country, which is definitely an important market to have in your pocket. They just happen to be new to making smartphones.
The entertainment and tech company is now venturing into new markets by making its own smartphones, and boy are these awesome! They announced three smartphones, which are all coming to the USA. These are the Le Max, Le 1 Pro and Le 1.
The trio of handsets is meant to be affordable, but they are in no way cheap. The best of the three has a full aluminum body, a 6.33-inch QHD display, a Snapdragon 810 processor, 4 GB of RAM, 64/128 GB of internal storage and a massive 3500 mAh battery. This thing is a beast!
Oh, and all of these come with USB-C, something smartphone manufacturers continue to take their sweet, sweet time on.
ZTE
ZTE is definitely much more popular, as they have managed to pierce into the American market and become a main player in the affordable smartphone market. Most people don't know ZTE can also make some mean quality smartphones, and they happen to also be a main player in Asia.
This is one of the few Chinese smartphone manufacturers to have a significant presence in America (and the rest of the world, really), and it's devices like the ZTE Grand X Max+, the ZTE Star 2 and the SPRO 2 that have taken it where it is.
ZTE is definitely here to stay, and the last few years they have done wonders to their design and build quality. In fact, they have their eyes set on the #3 spot in the USA. That is an ambitious goal – will they reach it?
Nubia
Nubia is new… but it really isn't. The truth is that this is pretty much a branch of ZTE, but they run independently now. They seriously do! These guys even have separate PR teams, which makes things a bit harder for us at times. It's all worth it, though, because they can make some awesome devices.
Nubia smartphones tend to have a much friendlier and sleek design. They are usually very affordable, but come with specs that make them more than usable for the casual customer. In fact, these phones have some of the best camera software I have ever used. My only gripe with their interface is that they have done away with the traditional app drawer, leaving all installed apps in the home screen (a la Apple).
Otherwise, Nubia's handsets tend to be very well built and are held to high performance standards. Want to see some great examples of Nubia's work? We recently published a review on the Nubia Z9, and I personally review the Nubia 5S Mini last year.
Axon
The Axon Phone mysteriously showed up online last June. We had no idea what this new manufacturer was about, but after some research we discovered it wasn't really an actual manufacturer. It turns out this new brand is linked to ZTE, which would make Axon yet another sub-brand of the Chinese phone maker. This company really wants to expand its reach!
We can't tell you too much about this branding yet, as there is only one device they have announced. For what it's worth, the Axon Phone does look like a very promising handset (even if it will have its challenges). It carries a “lightning-fast processor”, 4 GB of RAM, dual rear-facing cameras with “incredibly fast auto-focus” and “a large battery for all-around high performance”. It also happens to be the “first true high-fidelity phone to be available in the US”.
That sounds like a lot of PR jargon, to be honest. We really won't be able to pass judgement until we know more details and get to test the device. What we can tell you is the phone looks to have a great design and build quality. It looks great in pictures and will come with a metallic body.
Huawei
I love the attitude Huawei has taken toward their lack of recognition in the USA. They know they are the underdogs and they find clever ways to get their name out there… even though people don't even know how to pronounce it!
Truth is Huawei is another huge Chinese manufacturer with a bad reputation. Those who do know Huawei will recognize it for the super affordable handsets you usually find in American stores. Truth is Huawei is a huge manufacturer in other markets, especially Asian ones. Contrary to public belief (at least in America), Huawei makes some outstanding handsets. An example of a great device from the manufacturer is the Huawei Ascend Mate 7, which we have a full review on.
Huawei continues trying to gain market share in the USA with devices like the Huawei Ascend Mate 2, which offers a great bang for your buck. Recent rumors also point towards a Huawei-made Nexus device incoming. Surely, many more of you would be interested in Huawei if that ends up panning out.
Honor
Chinese tech brands aren't being very well-received in Western countries. In an effort to combat their long-established fame and get a foothold in other markets, companies have started branching out separate brands to produce phones independently. In this case, Huawei is to Honor what ZTE is to Nubia.
This technique seems to be working very well for the Chinese manufacturer, as Honor sales have been booming and the company plans to take on the US market this year. The truth is they make great devices, even if they do happen to be somewhat similar to Huawei's in some ways (which is not exactly a bad thing). Take a look at the Honor 6 Plus review we have put together if you want to see what the guys at Honor can do.
And beyond
This completes our quick look at some of the most dynamic and exciting smartphone brands to come out of China over the last few years. But these are just the bigger Chinese brands, the ones that have set their sights to the world at large. There are literally hundreds of smaller players in China. Brands like Elephone, Ulefone, Vivo, Umi, Zeaplus, Zuk, ZUK, Doogee, THL, and many many others. Though funny as some of these names may sound, they don't hold a candle to India's Wickedleak…
What about you? Have you ever used one of these brands? What do you think of this wave of China-based companies taking over the smartphone industry? Are you considering any smartphones from them?
Introduction
Chichester Cathedral (formally known as the Cathedral Church of the Holy Trinity) embraces nearly 1000 years of history and is located in the formally Roman town of Chichester, West Sussex.
Located just off the A27, the cathedral is in the center of the town, close to the Chichester Cross, which marks the intersection of the original Roman streets.
It is also reachable from London by train, direct from London Victoria station, duration ca. 1.5 hours.
The architecture of Chichester is varied, there are clear reminders of the Norman cathedral with Romanesque arches, which sit alongside later Gothic work.
There are different Gothic styles from the late 12th century through to the 15th century that can be spotted.
7th – 12th Century
Originally, the seat of the Bishop of Chichester was located 10 miles away in the town of Selsey, and was Saxon in origin, founded in 681 by St. Wilfrid.
There is little known about this period, but we do know that in 1075, a council made the decision to move the See to Chichester which was more populous.
According to the chronicler William of Malmesbury, there had already existed an ancient minster on the Chichester site dedicated to St. Peter.
The present cathedral was begun in 1076 by the first Norman Bishop Stigand, and was consecrated by Bishop Ralph Luffa in 1108.
It is to he that we owe the majority of the current building.
The cathedral was extended westwards in 1114 after a fire, and in 1187, a second fire tore through the town of Chichester and heavily damaged the cathedral.
The roof of the Nave had been made of wood, and the fire resulted in a reconstruction project, and to the current stone vault that we see today.
The cathedral was reconsecrated in 1199.
13th – 15th Century
By the 13th century, the central tower and eastern end were complete, including the Lady chapel.
The 13th century also saw the completion of additional chapels on either side of the Nave which formed double aisles, common in French cathedrals. This meant that Chichester became one of the widest cathedrals in England.
In 1262, Richard de la Wyche who was the Bishop of Chichester between 1245 – 1253 was canonised by Pope Urban IV.
His body was translated to a shrine in the Retro Choir in 1276 by the Archbishop Kilwardby in the presence of King Edward I.
This lead to the shrine becoming a popular place of pilgrimage.
The Lady Chapel was extended in the 14th Century, and the south wall of the south transept was redesigned to include the 7 windows we see today.
The 14th century also saw construction of the spire, and it was repaired by Sir Christopher Wren in the 17th century,
Unfortunately it collapsed in 1861, but was immediately rebuilt by George Gilbert Scott. It rises a total height of 269 feet.
The Cloisters were added in the 15th century, along with an external bell tower.
An Arundel Tomb
In the North side ailse of the Nave lies the tomb of Richard FitzAlan, the 10th Earl of Arundel.
His effigy lies next to that of his second wife's – Eleanor of Lancaster.
Richard was a key figure in 14th century England and was one of the trusted advisers of Edward the Black Prince, son of King Edward III. He fought in the Scottish wars (during the Second Wars of Scottish Independence) and in France (during the Hundred Years' War)
In 1337, he was made joint commander of the English army in the North.
It is a touching memorial as husband and wife are depicted holding hands which is quite unusual. It is also the subject of a poem by Philip Larkin, An Arundel Tomb
16th Century to present
The reformation of the church under King Henry VIII affected the cathedral greatly, with many monuments and carvings defaced. The shrine of St. Richard was destroyed, and it is thought this is when the cathedral lost it's medieval stained glass.
The 17th century saw the civil war and the cathedral suffered further under Parliamentary troops.
Thankfully, after centuries of neglect, a restoration was begun by Dean George Chandler in the 1840s.
In closing
Chichester is a wonderful place to see many different centuries of influence on cathedral architecture. I was also impressed by the Roman history, and you can see a Roman mosaic under the floor of the cathedral through a glass window. There is a lot of art in the cathedral as well, and Norman carvings remain.

Ben Carson greets fair goers Sunday at Iowa State Fair. | M.Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO Carson suggests Obama is 'anti-Semitic' with Iran deal
Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson says he believes some of President Barack Obama's actions are anti-semitic.
“I think anything is anti-Semitic if it's against the survival of a state that is surrounded by enemies and by people who want to destroy them and to sort of ignore that and to act like everything is normal there and that these people are paranoid is anti-Semitic,” Carson said on “Fox News Sunday.”
Story Continued Below
Carson did not specifically mention the Iran nuclear agreement, but said during a recent visit to Israel he could not find a single person who “didn't think this administration has turned its back on Israel.”
The retired neurosurgeon, who did his interview Sunday from the Iowa State Fair, where he's been campaigning, is now second nationally in the crowded field of 17 GOP presidential contenders in a new Fox News poll, with Donald Trump still at the top.
And Carson said he hopes his rising poll numbers will allow him more opportunities to talk about tax and foreign policy issues, rather than solely answer questions about race and health care.
“I want more people to talk to me about the economy and foreign affairs. I tend to get a lot of questions about race and about medicine,” he said.
Short answer: yes
Long answer: We have around 17 million people who go hunting every year. They all typically have 1 or more guns. Those facts don't include people who didn't go hunting that year either. The amount of registered hunters is much larger.
Just the 17 million hunters is magnitudes larger than the largest active army in the world, which is China with 2.3 million soldiers. http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/29-largest-armies-in-the-world.html
That doesn't include all of the gun owners who don't hunt. The gun owner estimate in american is 32%-52% of all americans own guns. Which is 41 to 61 million households owning a gun.
Guns sales have been setting records every year since 2008 with 23 million guns sold just in 2015.
America citizens bough so much ammo in 2008-2013 that is caused a well documented nation wide ammo shortage. So the americans with gun got a lot of ammo for those guns.
On top of that, it would be very hard to convince the American soliders to attack americans on american soil. I have a brother and several close friends who are in various branches of the military and they all say that there is no way they would every attack americans and all of their colleagues feel that way.
Even if the military did attack it would be 1.4 million US solider verse 30 to 50 million civilians. So the every american solider would have to kill 30 to 50 americans each, to achieve total victory. That is a hard thing to ask of them.
Pretty much everywhere you look, movie theaters and performance spaces are in trouble. Box office attendance is down. But you know what's up? At-home movie streaming. So what happens when everyone stays home and the movie palaces and multiplexes go dark? Are we losing something?
Matt Lambros has been traveling the country taking photographs of historic movie palaces— huge, ornate theaters with grand marquees, gilded chandeliers, crimson drapes, and stuccoed walls. Some cities have found creative ways to reuse them — as concert venues, hotel lobbies, even churches — but others are empty ruins. Matt wants to document as many of them as he can before they disappear.

The Hope Bridge Korea Disaster Relief Association revealed that both celebrities donated 50 million won (approximately $43,000) each to help the store owners who were affected by the fire in Daegu.
When asked to confirm this information, a representative of Park Shin Hye's agency stated, “Even we didn't know about her donation until later, but we have confirmed with her that she made the donation.”
Park Shin Hye is already well-known for her charitable activities, especially her work with Korea Food for the Hungry International, where she was recently inducted into the organization's Philanthropy Club. Through her work, she has helped cover heating expenses for low-income families and built schools in the Philippines and Ghana.
It seems that Yoo Jae Suk's donation was also done in secret, as Hope Bridge stated, “We saw that a donation was made in Yoo Jae Suk's name and called his manager to confirm that it was him. His manager was surprised as even he was not aware of the donation.” Yoo Jae Suk is also famous for his acts of charity, making multiple donations over the years to victims of natural disasters, including October's Typhoon Chaba.

It's hardly a novelty now but I actually started working on a Topre to Cherry MX adapter back in 2014. The NovaTouch was not a thing yet and no 3D model for the slider/converter was available at the time.
It's an incredibly simple model and I'm by no means a 3D expert, but anyway I hope you can make good use of it. Please note that everything is released under a Creative Common license, you are free to use and modify the models as long as you give credit and re-share under the same license.
Currently I have two models, they are both available on Shapeways if you want to order them directly. The first one has been already printed in various materials and it pretty much works (Keychatter reviewed it a while back). The other one is an updated revision but I never tried it yet, so use at your own risk.
Consider that for best result you should print in “Frosted Ultra Detail” that unfortunately is one of the most expensive material they have.
Many nowadays have access to 3D printers so I'm really curious to see what you do with my models; don't be shy and please share your creations! If you can work on the 3D file I would probably make the barrel (and the stem inside) 0.5mm shorter.

People aren't the only living things that suffer from stress. Trees must deal with stress too. It can come from a lack of water or too much water, from scarcity of a needed nutrient, from pollution or a changing climate. Helping trees and crops adapt to stress quickly and efficiently is a pressing goal of plant biologists worldwide.
Now research led by Michigan Technological University scientists has identified the molecular mechanism that Populus -- the scientific name for common poplars, cottonwoods and aspens -- uses to adapt to changing soil conditions, as well as some of the genes that turn the process off or on. They hope to apply what they've learned to find ways to use biotechnology or selective breeding to modify the trees to make them more stress-tolerant.
"Our hope is that by understanding how this works, we can manipulate the system so the plants can adapt faster and better to stressful conditions," explained Victor Busov, associate professor in Michigan Tech's School of Forest Resources and Environmental Science and senior author on a paper published in the March 2010 issue of the journal The Plant Cell.
Busov and colleagues at Michigan Tech, the University of Georgia, Oregon State University and the Beijing Forestry University in China analyzed thousands of genes in the Populus genome, the only tree genome that has been completely sequenced. They were searching for the mechanism that regulates the plant's decision to grow tall or to spread its roots out in an extensive underground exploration system that can sample the soil near and far until it finds what the rest of the plant needs.
The key players turned out to be a family of hormones called gibberellins, referred to by the scientists as GAs.
"GAs' role in root development is poorly understood," said Busov, "and the role of GAs in lateral root formation is almost completely unknown." Lateral roots are the tangle of tiny roots that branch out from the primary root of a plant. "They are the sponges," Busov explained, "the ones that go looking for nutrients, for water -- the ones that do most of the work."
The researchers found that GAs interact with other plant hormones such as auxin to tell the plant whether to concentrate on reaching for the sky or on building a bigger, better network of roots underground. "The GAs and auxin are definitely talking, molecularly," said Busov.
Growing poplar seedlings mutated to make them GA-deficient, the scientists compared their root and stem growth to others that contained moderate amounts of GAs and a control group of wild-type plants with normal GAs. They found that the more GAs, the more a plant's stem flourished, but its roots remained spindly. When GA production was shut down, either by using mutants that lacked the necessary genes or by silencing the genes that form the molecular on-off switch, the resulting plants looked dwarfed, but their lateral roots grew luxuriant and full.
Application of GA to the GA-deficient dwarf plants rapidly reversed the process. The plants grew tall, but their lateral root systems shriveled.
"Clearly, lack of the hormone promotes growth below ground, while the hormone itself promotes growth above ground," said Busov. "This is a natural mechanism that we don't know much about. It's always a tradeoff between growth above ground and growth below ground. Normally there is a fine balance, and this balance is a little disturbed under stress."
In a commentary on the research published in the same issue of the journal, Kathleen Farquharson, science editor of The Plant Cell, wrote: "This study provides important insights into how plant hormones regulate lateral root development."
The research was supported in part by grants from the US Department of Energy's Poplar Genome Based Research for Carbon Sequestration in Terrestrial Ecosystems project ad by the US Department of Agriculture's National Plant Genome initiative.
Now That's Some Good Bias: Networks Devote More Time to Christie's "Bridgegate" Pseudoscandal in Four Days Than They Devote to the VA Scandal In an Entire Month
The stopwatch doesn't lie, but reporters do.
Once again a big shout-out to ABCNews, the organization that is actually the most biased of the network newscasts. NBC is less biased, frequently, as hard as that is to believe.
In this case, while NBC devoted a paltry 44 minutes to the VA scandal, ABCNews devoted just sixteen and some seconds.
And I have a feeling I know how the networks will be playing the story in the coming weeks:\
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., repeatedly put the blame for the Veterans Affairs scandal on former President George W. Bush, while arguing that her party has worked hard for veterans in recent years. Pelosi took a shot at Bush while saying that the scandal is a high priority for Obama. "He sees the ramifications of some seeds that were sown a long time ago, when you have two wars over a long period of time and many, many more, millions more veterans," she told reporters during her Thursday press briefing. "And so, I know that he is upset about it."
Gabe mentioned this spinline in the podcast. Sounds good. Seems plausible.
The fact that it's simply not true will not discomfit the media Palace Guard.
Some will argue that the increase in health spending was the direct result of all those wounded warriors coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. But these vets aren't driving VA costs higher. A Congressional Budget Office report found that they cost $4,800, on average, in 2010 compared with $8,800 for other veterans who used the system. It also found that while these Iraq and Afghan vets account for 7% of those treated, they were responsible for only 4% of its health costs. Iraq and Afghan vets, the report found, "are typically younger and healthier than the average VHA patient and as a result are less expensive to treat."
In fact, what's driving VA costs is the same thing that's driving Medicare and Social Security spending: A big population swell called the Baby Boom generation and the many veterans of the Vietnam War, which is coming into its very costly late-in-life years.
Now, it will probably be the case that thirty years from now, this big swell of military personnel seeking treatment from the VA will create a big swell of new costs.
But that's... thirty years from now. That cannot excuse the VA now.
In addition, care for veterans has soared 27% from 2008-2012, while average health care costs for the nation generally have only risen 13% over the same period.
So, shockingly enough, it appears yet again that things get very expensive indeed when they're "free."
By the way, this particular spin directly contradicts the other liberal spin.
Rachel Maddow claims the VA scandal is not a "scandal" at all, but rather just a "problem in progress" which we've known about for years and years -- that is, that the VA has long been a dysfunctional agency.
Incidentally, Maddow was pretty sure the Walter Reed scandal was in fact a scandal.
But this one? A "problem in progress."
So which is it? Is this, per the drooling Nancy Pelosi, a problem that just snuck up on us in the last couple of years as veterans have returned from Afghanistan and thus a scandal to be laid at the feet of George W. Bush, or is this, per the frothing Rachel Maddow, a problem that's been going on forever and therefore no scandal at all?
It can't be both, Progressives.
The Progressive Philosophy
Oh yes it can be both, or neither, or one or the other, or the other or the one, as current political needs might dictate, and our position may change on this six times by Sunday.
The following is an op-ed written by that guy in 3rd Squad.
Yooooooooooo! My fuckin' dude! What is UP, bro? I haven't seen you in a minute. I know; I know; I know. Yo. I know. I am with you, dude. I'm so over this shit. Dog, I am so for-real. I am about to fucking run my ass down the road Bergdahl-style, bro. I am telling you, these NCOs are on some other shit out here.
Check out high-speed right here. One, two, one, two; ole boy strutting around like he's fucking T-2000. Nrrt. Robo-sergeant reporting for duty, sir. Sir, yes, sir. PT belt activated. Douchebag status confirmed. Charlie-mike! This clown counseled me the other day, too. Hell yeah. For fucking skyping my girl in the guard tower. Dog, he's lucky he didn't walk up there at the wrong time, too. Shit, you know me and my girl get to talking, shit starts going down, you know how it is. I put a sign up on the tower door: “If the tower's a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.” Haha, no, he didn't like that one bit.
Fuckin' dickface.
Yo. How'd you do on that PT test the other day? Yeah? My dude! That's good shit! You aren't careful, they'll have you all chevroned-up like super soldier over here. Oh, shit, hold on, let me hide so fuckface doesn't see me. I'm supposed to be policing trash.
Is he gone?
Anyway, about these fuckin' PT tests, bro. I passed pushups. Like, of course I did. Sit-ups are always kinda iffy. But, the run. Like, I tell these doctors that my knee is messed up from when I flipped my truck and they just aren't hooking me up with the profile. You have seen fat ass Sgt. McNeil? Walking his ass around the track for 22 minutes or some shit. Shit, I could do that. Then they wonder why I fail tape. Like, no shit I fail tape, look at my upper body muscle. I weigh 240 pounds and crank out 55 push-ups like an animal. You think that's all gut weight? BMI isn't even a good measure of this shit.
I keep tellin' ‘em, bro. Nobody listens.
All these numbers are fucking bullshit. Oh, this dude did 68 sit-ups? Okay, that's, uh, hmmm, let's see, that's like an 80-somethin', we'll call it. 68 push-ups, on the other hand, that's a 90-somethin', you see. We've got it all worked out on the computer. Fuck outta here with that bullshit. PT scores are some fuckin' officer's opinion. That's what I want to tell these dudes. My PT score is just, like, your opinion, man. How are you gonna keep me down over this dumb shit? How am I supposed to run an 18-minute two-mile carrying all this muscle?
But, yo, bro, I hate to have to ask, but I only got a minute here. You think you can spot me a cig so I can get back to work without layin' out one of these dickhead NCO's?
Thanks, dog. I know I hit you up all the time. I'll get you back one of these days. Definitely.
Aight. Stay up.
Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho says he will not demand any new signings in January, has no need to "clean the dressing room" and is confident the club can climb out of their slump.
The reigning Premier League champions are currently 16th in the table, with three wins and seven losses from 12 games leaving them three points clear of the relegation zone and 15 adrift of leaders Manchester City.
Mourinho, who received support from Chelsea technical director Michael Emenalo on Friday, says he will not ask for a change of players in the forthcoming transfer window.
"I will not ask any change to the board for January. I am happy with my players, I trust the players,'' Mourinho told a news conference ahead of Saturday's Premier League game at home to Norwich. "I don't need to clean the dressing room, like I heard was written somewhere. And I don't need to ask the club to spend money in January.
"We put ourselves in a great situation being champions. We have to be again together in ourselves to put it in the right place. The situation is good in the squad so we really believe good things are coming for us.''
Mourinho was the subject of the first managerial vote of confidence in Roman Abramovich's 12-year Chelsea ownership on Oct. 5.
The caveat of the board's support was that results must improve, but Chelsea have won just twice in seven games since then.
"When you play well and lose it's more difficult to cope with it," Mourinho said. "We have to try to play well and hopefully get the result we need.
Jose Mourinho and Chelsea are enduring a difficult season.
"In football and in management every experience is positive, but I still prefer the experience of winning.''
The season has been marred by disciplinary offences and Mourinho was absent from the 1-0 loss at Stoke on Nov. 7 due to a stadium ban.
The Portuguese returns to the dugout on Saturday against Norwich, but he declined to discuss his banishment.
Mourinho, who has a suspended one-match ban hanging over him after losing an appeal for a separate offence, said: "It's over, let's forget it.''
The History Channel more or less abandoned the pretext of history years ago. As programs like "UFO Hunters", "Swamp People" and "Hairy Bikers" added up, the network's decision to broadcast The Bible as a mini-series seemed like an obvious disaster. It is, too, in all ways except one: ratings. The scriptures according to basic cable don't purport to be historical, but they're about as bad and cynical as TV can be.
I don't necessarily question the sincerity of the head producers, Mark Burnett, the creator of the reality show Survivor, and his wife, Roma Downey; they've said this is their "calling" and want to alleviate "Bible illiteracy". I do question their methods, however, not to mention the results.
Why are so many people watching? Narrative? The producers don't seem very concerned with narrative. The book has more rich stories and characters than could ever fit into a mini-series, a fact the producers acknowledge by leaving most of it out. They jump from one famous story to another; Eden, Noah, and Moses get crammed into one episode, for example. The Ten Commandments only get a brief mention by the narrator. Characters are one-dimensionally good or evil, and the dialogue is so wooden Jesus could've carved a table out of it. The sum is bland, erratic, and would be incoherent if it weren't somewhat familiar material. The Wire this is not. Nor is it Mad Men: people sure aren't watching for the production values. The actors deliver lines with the bombast of a comic book or the whispery solemnity of a high school staging Hamlet. The CGI and slo-mo action sequences, which are legion, evoke nostalgia for Cecil B DeMille's Red Sea. Downey has bragged about the show's low budget, but the result is so cringe-inducing that one wishes History had tossed them a few more shekels.
Bible scholars have made deeper criticisms, including the "whitewashed" cast, the marginalized role of women, and an aversion to unpleasant details so strong that the show ultimately misrepresents the Bible.
The cast, touted as "international", consists of mostly white Europeans and Americans; so far, only Samson and Satan have been major characters played by minorities, sparking anger and amusement, for the respective castings.
Patriarchy of the text aside, the Bible doesn't work without its many strong women, but the series keeps them on the margins, even when Downey herself dons Mary's veil several hours in. These decisions are aimed at making the show more immediately familiar to the conservative, American Christians, who apparently can't handle actors who don't look like them. Glenn Beck, for instance – a man who might be called resistant to change – has praised it as "a vision, a gift that I haven't seen ever before on television".
Moreover, the show airbrushes or omits anything even remotely uncomfortable: slaves are referred to as "servants", all marriages are made to look monogamous, and violence is mostly portrayed as either God's will or the actions of villains. Per the scholar Wil Gafney:
"The Bible is a wonderfully rich, complicated, challenging, illuminating, revelatory text. It is also horrifically violent and does not say what we want the way we want it to."
Great but ambiguous stories – the one where God and the devil ruin a man's life on a bet, for instance – have no place in this series. One suspects they skip the Ten Commandments because of that bit when Moses crashes the party round a golden calf. Don't expect to see any of the really dark or strange stuff, either, like what happens to Lot after his wife turns to salt. But as Professor Paul Harvey points out, the show has courted its audience effusively.
The producers pre-screened the show to religious leaders, picking up endorsements from mega-church pastors Rick Warren and Joel Osteen and a "partnership" with the World Evangelical Alliance. Christian dating sites jumped on board, and even Walmart has aggressively promoted the show. All this for a readymade audience.
Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ broke box office records, despite Inquisition levels of violence and anti-Semitic overtones. Dan Brown made a fortune with a poorly written tale about Jesus with kids and a psychotic monk. Because biblical basics are ingrained in our culture, and because they're so powerful in the right hands – like those of Mikhail Bulgakov, Toni Morrison or even Monty Python – works with religious underpinnings will always draw a crowd.
Nobody expected art – or even history – from the History Channel, but the producers veered so far in the opposite direction that they erased all the personality and depth of the source, not to mention heart or wit. The History Channel has given us the Bible as reality TV. The result amounts to little more than an exploitation of faith. Everyone – believers, nonbelievers, anyone who appreciates a good story or TV series – deserves better.

The UK generated more electricity from wind than from coal in the full calendar year of 2016, Carbon Brief analysis shows.
The milestone is a first for the UK and reflects a collapse in coal generation, which contributed just 9.2% of UK electricity last year, with 11.5% from wind. The coal decline saw its output fall to the lowest level since 1935.
It also means CO2 emissions from UK power generation will have fallen by around 20% in 2016, as coal was largely replaced by lower-emissions gas. This reduction will be enough to cut overall UK CO2 emissions by 6% for the year, if other sectors' emissions are unchanged.
Carbon Brief's estimates of UK electricity generation and emissions in 2016 are based on a range of sources and our own analysis. (See below for details.) The Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) will publish its own estimates on 30 March.
UK wind beats coal
The past 12 months have seen a year of firsts for the UK's electricity system. At the broadest level, the UK grid is changing as centralised power stations are joined by thousands of smaller sites, particularly renewables, as part of efforts to decarbonise electricity supplies.
Other important factors include falling electricity demand, rising imports from continental Europe and changes in the relative price of coal and gas on wholesale energy markets. The UK's top-up carbon tax, the carbon price floor, also doubled in April 2015.
In March 2016, as Carbon Brief analysis revealed, coal generation fell to zero for the first time since public electricity supply started in 1882. Wind generated more electricity than coal in April 2016, the first month this had ever happened.
Then Carbon Brief analysis showed solar also generated more electricity than coal in April, again the first month this had ever happened. Solar went on to generate more power than coal during the half year from April to September 2016.
Now, Carbon Brief analysis of the full twelve months of 2016 shows that wind generated more electricity than coal, as the chart below shows. This first was possible largely because of falling coal generation, which was down 59% on a year earlier.
UK electricity generation by source, terawatt hours (TWh). Source: BEIS Energy Trends table 5.1 and Carbon Brief analysis (see below). Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts
As the chart shows, this drop in coal output in 2016 was largely filled by an increase in gas generation, which was up 45% year on year. However, it's worth noting that generation from coal and gas combined has fallen by 38% since 2010, when the coalition government took office.
Some 68% of the reduction in fossil-fuelled electricity since 2010 has been substituted with low-carbon sources, mainly renewables. Imported power replaced another 22% and reduced consumption accounted for the remaining 10%.
As a result of these changes, CO2 emissions from UK electricity generation in 2016 were approximately half those in 2010. Last year saw a particularly dramatic 20% reduction, Carbon Brief analysis shows, as coal use fell sharply.
Coal collapse
The reduction in coal generation during 2016 was a continuation of several years' decline, such that output is now down nearly 80% since a 2012 peak, as the chart below shows.
UK annual electricity generation by source, terawatt hours (TWh). Source: BEIS Energy Trends table 5.1 , historical electricity data and Carbon Brief analysis (see below). Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts
The amount of electricity generated by coal-fired power stations in 2016 – at an estimated 31 terawatt hours (TWh) – was the lowest since around 1935, Carbon Brief analysis suggests. That year, President Roosevelt opened the giant Hoover Dam in Nevada and Hitler began remilitarising Germany.
Coal's share of 2016 electricity generation, at 9.2%, was the lowest ever. Even during the peak of the miners' strike in 1985 (seen in the marked dip in coal output on the chart), coal generated some 45% of UK power, with oil and nuclear making up the remainder.
In spring 2016, three UK coal-fired power stations closed down. The UK plans to close all of its remaining coal plants by 2025.
Seasons of change
It's worth looking more closely at last year's record-breaking 12 months for UK electricity, in the month-by-month chart, below. You can see that coal's share of generation fell as low as 2.5%, in the month of August.
UK monthly electricity generation by source, gigawatt hours (GWh). Source: BEIS Energy Trends table 5.1 and Carbon Brief analysis (see below). Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts
You can also see how wind and solar output are complementary: more electricity is generated by solar in summer, while wind turbines are most productive in winter.
One final point of interest is the uptick in overall electricity generation towards the end of 2016. This was a result of falling electricity imports from France, where an ongoing crisis has closed a number of nuclear power stations.
This uptick is reflected in the annual chart, where total UK electricity generation increased between 2015 and 2016.
Notes
Carbon Brief's estimates for UK electricity generation in 2016 are based on the following sources: BEIS electricity generation figures for Q1-Q3, from Energy Trends table 5.1 (“electricity generated by all operating companies”).
This data was supplemented with BM Reports figures for grid-connected generation during October, November and December. Solar generation estimates for these months comes from Sheffield Solar.
Carbon Brief estimated the output from embedded generation not connected to the UK grid, using statistical methods based on previous months' data. Embedded generation is predominantly made up of solar and onshore wind, as well as some gas-fired plant at industrial sites.
Bioenergy includes biomass, such as the wood pellets burned at Drax in Yorkshire, as well as energy from landfill gas and other wastes.

Everyone who commented and contributes on the Bethesda/TES/Morrowind Forums Donation Points system This mod is not opted-in to receive Donation Points
Notice: v1.33 update (separate download from the Main File) does 2 things:
- Adds new MGE-XE 10B24 scripted effects: sun glare, wind speed and cloud speed variations.
Most noticeably, now incliment weather sky breaks are accompanied by the sun coming out.
- Fixes a potential CTD associated with long mod lists and MWSE 2.0. Thanks to Hummes' help to debug it!
This mod uses a command line co-executable running in parallel with Morrowind to coordinate ImageMagick and TES3CMD command line calls with MGE-XE and MWSE scripting to generate unique nightly star and moon textures and unique each weather change sky textures. Additional scripting effects include real time varying cloudbreak colors, occasional weather breaks with chance of rainbows, and northern latitude auroras.
Part of the May 2016 Modathon Month!
See the screenshots and videos..
v1.01 - added sve_skd_rnbw_min/max_blur = 5/7 (previously hard coded to 3)
v1.02 - further tuned rainbow blurring to support new default min/max = 6/12
- adjusted rainbow opacity from 0.15-0.35 to 0.25-0.40 based on bethsoft forum poll results
- fixed skybreak color bug that was causing day, sunset and night skies to be off
from what they should have been (with sunset and night especially effected)
v1.03 - fixed MWCMD_SkyDiversity_global_overrides.ini parsing error
in earlier releases that prevented reading the file correctly
v1.10 - added vtastek shader rainbow support
v1.11 - corrected MWSE version requirement in readme
v1.20 - removed MWSE. dll and MGEXEgui. exe date check due to format region dependence
- modified script to eliminate stray inventory refresh tokens by default
- added MCP 2-3 beta requirement to fix intermittent scripting bug
- fixed sudden rainbow appearance/disappearance bugs
- added sun color variation with sky color, mainly to improve rainbow visibilities
- tweaked several globals to tie rainbow intensity to sky color
- added global_override.ini overrides for 100% chance of cloud and weather break rainbows
v1.30 - fixed rainbow shader to only activate during rainy/thunderstorm/snowy sky and weather breaks
- added "SHFT-X-Z" menu options for sky/moon/aurora favorites generation, saving, loading and deleting - added "SHFT-X-Z" menu options for changing a few of the most common global variables controlling sky, moon and borealis texture generation vs loading, sky and weather break time periods, moon generation types, etc.Notes: This mod is incompatible with OpenMW due to MGE-XE, MWSE and original CS purgetextures function calls.
This mod is compatible with the Steam version but requires launching Morriwind as normal
for Steam, followed by alt-tab back launch MWCMD. exe after reaching the main menu. Sorry
for the inconvenience and hopefully some better method can be devised in the future.
All weather types seed sky textures
- Randomly selects from any number of textures with the format Tx_*Sky_<weather>*.dds placed in the Data Files\Textures\SkyDiversity\Sky_Variations folder; this folder will be created the first time MWCMD runs, with original Sky textures subdirectory.
Clear and cloudy weather
- Randomly overlays a second, third, fourth .. clear or cloudy texture
- Randomly adjusts the density (alpha component) of the sky texture(s)
All other weathers (Foggy, Overcast, Rainy, Thunder, AshStorm, Blight, Snow, Blizzard)
- Randomly generates sky breaks in the sky textures overlaid on top of the default sky background color
- Randomly overlays the broken sky on top of a randomly generated extra cloudy background
- gradually alternates the cloudy covered broken sky breaks between the default (typically gray) and cloudy (typically blue) sky colors
Inclement weather breaks (Rainy, Thunder, AshStorm, Blight, Snow, Blizzard)
- Random breaks in rain/ash/blight/snow precipitation allowing easier skygazing
Rainbows during Rainy, Thunder and Snow Weather breaks
- Adds a chance of gradual rainbow appearance and disappearance during Rainy, Thunder and Snow weather break
Stars
- By default, extends and rotates the stars texture to give an off-center view that traverses a complete cycle once per year; it's not quite astronomically accurate but it's closer than the default game engine 4 day centered cycle
- Optionally (in the console "set sve_skd_stars_rotate_or_random to 1") randomly selects a new star texture every night from any number of textures with the format Tx_Sky_Stars*.dds placed in the Data Files/Textures/SkyDiversity/Stars_Variations/ subdirectory
Aurora Borealis
- Northern lights of varying shape, colors and intensity will appear in the night sky at far north latitudes.
Moons
- Generates 24 unique moon textures per full moon cycle (instead of the default 8) filling in more or less new, crescent, half, gibbous and full moon illuminations.
- Adds some random rotation to "dry" or "wet" looking moons on the horizon (not astronomically linked to the season as in real life)
- Optional and customizable planetshine and atmospheric scattering effects
- Every moon every night is unique with each passing day and month
Particles
- Randomly adjusts particle (rain, snow, ash, etc) textures to be heavier (lower alpha content) or lighter (higher alpha content) once per day.
My Involvement with Team Impulse and Known Payment Issues
Going to keep this as simple as possible while giving all the details that I know.
My involvement with Team Impulse:
I was contacted by Team Impulse management that they require a substitute for the first two weeks of LCS on January 1st. My participation agreement was signed on the 2nd (for Riot record and officially listing me on the roster) and I moved to their gaming house on the 14th after subbing in for Top Dog Gaming (I will have another post in the near future in regarding what happened in the end with the payments w/ Top Dog.)
At the time the team actually have decent dynamic, there was chaos due to the visa issue but players are involved and have productive practice. TIP ended with 2-2 record by the end of week 2 despite having the 0-2 start and the fastest losing record in LCS against IMT.
Before I left the team house, I offered my service as an analyst for another short period of time due to the lack of infrastructure. TIP at the time has a coach that is new to the scene and no analyst; I continued in helping them up to around week 4, where my schoolwork starts to overload me and I cease to watch their scrims, while still have comment on their pick&ban whenever possible. The analyst is unpaid volunteer work and I am fully aware of that.
Then around one week before the original relegation match date (later it was delayed for two weeks), team manager Lucas contacted me that he requires my assistance and be at the house for a week to prepare for the relegation. At the time I was having my midterm and I refused as the risk is too big and the job is unpaid. Later on when Riot announced that the match will be delayed for two weeks, I went to the team house for a week to prepare and fixes internal problems. Left on Saturday then returned on Wednesday so I will be on site at the Riot studio during the match. The match against APEX ended in Team Impulse victory, 3-1.
Onto the payment issue:
As a substitute player, there is a Minimum Player Compensation (MPC) that Riot enforces for any player that has played a match on stage.
I have not been paid for the 4 matches that I played for Team Impulse, and my travelling costs in assisting the team which was promised to be reimbursed.
Beibei has played for 3(?) matches total. Both his MPC and travelling costs are not paid.
Our coach Jason has not been paid for the past three months
Players including Feng, Gate and Mash are all owe at least a month of salary, plus other promised payments. (Cannot speak for the Koreans as I don't really talk to them that much)
Another assistance coach Jay, hired for the relegation match, has not been paid.
tl;dr: Basically everyone is owed in money, owner refuses to put in money.

The reluctance of oil and water to mix together and stay that way is so well-known that it has become a cliché for describing any two things that do not go together well. Now, a new finding from researchers at MIT might turn that expression on its head, providing a way to get the two substances to mix and remain stable for long periods — no shaking required. The process may find applications in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and processed foods, among other areas.
The new process involves cooling a bath of oil containing a small amount of a surfactant (a soap-like substance), and then letting water vapor from the surrounding air condense onto the oil surface. Experiments have shown that this can produce tiny, uniform water droplets on the surface that then sink into the oil, and their size can be controlled by adjusting the proportion of surfactant. The findings, by MIT graduate student Ingrid Guha, former postdoc Sushant Anand, and associate professor Kripa Varanasi, are reported in the journal Nature Communications.
As anyone who has ever used salad dressing knows, no matter how vigorously the mixture gets shaken, the oil and the vinegar (a water-based solution) will separate within minutes. But for many uses, including new drug-delivery systems and food-processing methods, it's important to be able to get oil in water (or water in oil) to form tiny droplets — only a few hundred nanometers across, too small to see with the naked eye — and to have them stay tiny rather than coalescing into larger droplets and eventually separating from the other liquid.
Typically, in industrial processes these emulsions are made by either mechanically shaking the mix or using sound waves to set up intense vibrations within the liquid, a process called sonicating. But both of these processes “require a lot of energy,” Varanasi says, “and the finer the drops, the more energy it takes.” By contrast, “our approach is very energy inexpensive,” he adds.
“The key to overcoming that separation is to have really small, nanoscale droplets,” Guha explains. “When the drops are small, gravity can't overcome them,” and they can remain suspended indefinitely.
For the new process, the team set up a reservoir of oil with an added surfactant that can bind to both oil and water molecules. They placed this inside a chamber with very humid air and then cooled the oil. Like a glass of cold water on a hot summer day, the colder surface causes the water vapor to precipitate. The condensing water then forms droplets at the surface that spread through the oil-surfactant mixture, and the sizes of these droplets are quite uniform, the team found. “If you get the chemistry just right, you can get just the right dispersion,” Guha says. By adjusting the proportion of surfactant in the oil, the droplet sizes can be well-controlled.
In the experiments, the team produced nanoscale emulsions that remained stable over periods of several months, compared to the few minutes that it takes for the same mixture of oil and water to separate without the added surfactant. “The droplets stay so small that they're hard to see even under a microscope,” Guha says.
Unlike the shaking or sonicating methods, which take the large, separate masses of oil and water and gradually get them to break down into smaller drops — a “top down” approach — the condensation method starts off right away with the tiny droplets condensing out from the vapor, which the researchers call a bottom-up approach. “By cloaking the freshly condensed nanoscale water droplets with oil, we are taking advantage of the inherent nature of phase-change and spreading phenomena,” Varanasi says.
“Our bottom-up approach of creating nanoscale emulsions is highly scalable owing to the simplicity of the process,” Anand says. “We have uncovered many new phenomena during this work. We have found how the presence of surfactant can change the oil and water interactions under such conditions, promoting oil spreading on water droplets and stabilizing them at the nanoscale.”
The team says that the approach should work with a variety of oils and surfactants, and now that the process has been identified, their findings “provide a kind of design guideline for someone to use” for a particular kind of application, Varanasi says.
“It's such an important thing,” he says, because “foods and pharmaceuticals always have an expiration date,” and often that has to do with the instability of the emulsions in them. The experiments used a particular surfactant that is widely used, but many other varieties are available, including some that are approved for food-grade products.
In addition, Guha says, “we envision that you could use multiple liquids and make much more complex emulsions.” And besides being used in food, cosmetics, and drugs, the method could have other applications, such as in the oil and gas industry, where fluids such as the drilling “muds” sent down wells are also emulsions, Varanasi says.
The work was supported by the MIT Energy Initiative, the National Science Foundation, and a Society in Science fellowship. Anand, the co-author who was a postdoc at MIT, is now an assistant professor at the University of Illinois.
CLOSE Shaun White arrived in Sochi trying to win two gold medals, but leaves with none. There was some good news for team U.S.A though as an American woman made Olympic history. VPC

KRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia -- Shaun White arrived in Sochi trying to win two gold medals. He leaves with none.
White finished fourth in the men's halfpipe competition Tuesday night at Rosa Khutor Extreme Park, ending his reign as Olympic champion dating to the 2006 Games in Turin.
The new halfpipe king is Iouri Podladtchikov, a Swiss rider with some of the biggest tricks in snowboarding, including his trademark trick called YOLO, which he landed here on his gold medal run. Even before he saw his score of 94.75, Podladtchikov tossed his snowboard in celebration.
"It all was meant to be. I was in a position where I was throwing down my hardest tricks with ease, it was like … there is no word for that," Podladtchikov said.
LEITCH: Shaun White, the crushed tomato
FTW: White blew his chance at becoming legend
And this from a man who answered questions in Russian, English, German and Dutch in his post-victory press conference.
Five others couldn't top the rider more commonly known as IPod – who was born in Russia before moving to Switzerland with his parents at age 8. But White, the last rider to drop into the halfpipe, was the only one in the Olympic field with an arsenal of tricks that could keep up.
On this night, he couldn't do it.
White's final run was uncharacteristically sloppy, without a complete fall but with multiple bobbles, and received a score of 90.25, an improvement of his first run in which he fell twice, but only good enough for fourth place. White had been trying to become the first American man to win the same winter event in three consecutive Games. Speedskater Shani Davis will try to accomplish that feat in the 1,000 on Wednesday.
In White's first two Olympics, Torino in 2006 and Vancouver in 2010, he had laid down his winning run to open the finals, with his second run serving merely as a victory lap.

BRENNAN: No shame for U.S. ski jumpers
Never before in an Olympics had White faced this sort of pressure. And he slid along the base of the course late Tuesday believing he could have done more.
"I didn't really get to break out everything, which is frustrating. Tricks are still in my pocket," White said. "I definitely knew what run I wanted to put down, and my dream scenario was I was going to land that first run and then maybe have the opportunity to do something that hadn't been done before. I tried to win. I went for it."
Japanese riders Ayumu Hirano, the youngest rider in the competition at age 15, and Taku Hiraoka won the silver and bronze. Americans had won eight of 12 previous medals awarded in men's halfpipe dating to its inclusion in the Olympics in 1998.
This is the first time the Americans have been shut out of the podium since 1998.

"I think it's great the American public and the world now knows that there are other snowboarders besides Shaun White," said U.S. rider Danny Davis, who finished 10th. "Shaun's, don't get me wrong, one of the most talented, one of the best riders there are, but there are guys who are just as good if not better and today Iouri was the best rider."
Perhaps it was a fitting ending to the Games for White after nearly a week of controversy. White pulled out of the slopestyle competition less than 24 hours before qualifying rounds, prompting rivals to suggest White may have been scared to lose. White withdrew from the event too late for the United States to replace him.
In White's absence, American Sage Kotsenburg won the first-ever slopestyle gold and became the first breakout star of the Games.
White said late Tuesday night that he backed out of slopestyle because of concerns about the design of the course at Rosa Khutor Extreme Park, calling it a strategic move and a "better bet" to place all of his focus on the halfpipe, his signature event.
Yet when attention turned to the halfpipe by Sunday evening, riders were furious about the conditions of the pipe, from walls that were too vertical, to a flat bottom that on Monday was so bumpy that riders said it resembled a moguls course. White was among the many riders who were unable to practice their full Olympic runs and full complement of tricks in training, including one that was shortened by more than an hour Monday evening because of poor conditions in the pipe.
"To be honest, I woke up this morning not even knowing if I'd be able to land one run," White said.
The pipe was improved for Tuesday's competition, but not perfect, and the final session was sloppy as the best riders pulled out their best tricks. Several riders wiped out multiple times, including Americans Greg Bretz and Davis, each of whom failed to land a clean run in the finals. Bretz finished 12th.
Bretz and Davis received words of encouragement from fellow U.S. snowboarders, including Kotsenburg, who in a Tweet called Davis, "your favorite snowboarder's favorite snowboarder."
White's tumble from atop the Olympic podium might serve to further reveal the schism between White, whose off-snow endeavors include touring with his band called Bad Things, and the snowboarders like Kotsenburg who have rocketed to stardom here.
"I don't think tonight makes or breaks my career. I've been doing this so long. I love it. It's given me so much that you know I'm happy to take this for what it is and move on and continue to ride," White said. "I would always like to be remembered as so much more than just a snowboarder. I've got so much going on in my life, and this is one big part of who I am, but it isn't all of who I am."
Meanwhile, Podladtchikov was whisked away for the pageantry that comes with winning a gold medal in one of the Olympics' marquee events. There would be television appearances and the official medal ceremony and certainly one heck of a party.
Fellow Swiss rider David Habluetzel revealed part of Podladtchikov's plans.
"Vodka, caviar, and friends," said Habluetzel, who finished fifth.

A north Wales town has a cold war thriller on its hands after nuclear submarine plans were found in a charity shop suitcase.
Staff at a Barnardo's store in Porthmadog, Gwynedd, were amazed to discover the document showing details of the former £200m HMS Trafalgar.
"Someone said that if the phone rang and it was someone with a Russian accent, I should put it down," joked manager, Stella Parker.
The plans will be auctioned off.
Charity store staff say the suitcase was donated anonymously and filled with books.
But hidden in the lining of the luggage was the impressive 6ft (1.8m) drawings of the former Royal Navy vessel.
While unusual finds are not uncommon for the charity shop, Ms Parker said she quickly recognised this was something out of the ordinary.
"When I found it I just thought, wow, this is amazing," she said.
"I can only imagine perhaps the family of someone who had passed away donated the suitcase, that is what often happens. perhaps they did not know the plan was there.
"We are all very excited here about it and we've certainly never seen anything like it before."

Mrs Parker took the plans to be looked at by experts when the TV show, David Dickinson's Real Deal, visited the Gwynedd town.
She was told there that the plans were most likely posted on the sub to familiarise the crew with the lay-out of the vessel.
It seems more likely that the document comes from Vickers, who built Trafalgar, or the submarine's designers.
During its years in service, Trafalgar prowled under the frozen polar icecaps keeping the then-Soviet threat in check.
It also served the Afghanistan conflict and became the first Royal Navy submarine to launch Tomahawk cruise missiles against Taliban forces.
In 1996 the sub gained notoriety after running aground off the Isle of Skye during a training exercise, causing £5m worth of damage.

The Plymouth-based vessel was decommissioned in 2009.
But foreign agents looking to get their hands on the document today will face an easier task than they did in the 1980s - as the plans have been declassified and are being auctioned by the shop.
Ms Parker said: "We are hoping to raise as much money as we can. one thing for certain is that you are not going to be able to buy one of these anywhere else."
You may recall that during the last Super Bowl, Will Ferrell served as a spokesman for Old Milwaukee—but only in North Platte, Nebraska, the sole market to air the comedian's deadpan beer commercial. It was then the strangest development in Ferrell's odd trajectory as Old Milwaukee pitchman—supposedly a role he took on himself.
But that's nothing compared to what appears to have happened some time in the last few weeks: Ferrell is now taping spots for the Swedish market. There are several. Here's one in which Ferrell speaks what I assume is Swedish-sounding gibberish.*
I'll leave it to native speakers to tell me if that is, in fact, gibberish, and whether or not it actually sounds Norwegian.
*Update: Commenters OkarS and Bookfisher Von Herring both report that Ferrell is actually speaking Swedish! Their concurring translations: “This is my boat. This is my woman. And this is my beer. Old Milwaukee. It's all right.” And my Slate colleague Jeremy Stahl points out that Ferrell is himself married to a Swedish woman, the actress Viveca Paulin.

Adult Swim is arguably the world's premier outlet for 15-minute TV shows that are best experienced under the influence of drugs and/or lack of sleep. And now the glorified schedule block has announced its next array of one-off specials and new series pilots that will make you say, “Wait, what the fuck is this?” while channel surfing. All told, Adult Swim is developing 30 new shows, specials, and pilots for this year and the next, with visionaries like Adam Scott, Justin Roiland (of Adventure Time, Gravity Falls, and Rick And Morty fame), and Seth Green developing some of the projects. This all comes from The Wrap, which quotes Christina Miller—the president and general manager of Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, and Boomerang—as saying that “this new slate of original programming adds to our growing line-up of successful primetime comedies.” Don't be fooled by that boring corporate language, though, because some of these shows sound pretty great.
First up are the new shows and specials, which include TV Sucks—a 15-minute “animated sketch show” created by China, IL's Brad Neely—and Jon Glaser's Neon Joe, Werewolf Hunter, which is about a guy wearing neon clothes who hunt werewolves. There will also be a third Robot Chicken DC Comics Special, which will feature the usual collection of surprisingly famous actors voicing the characters, like Nathan Fillion, Alfred Molina, Jonathan Banks, “Weird” Al Yankovic, and Mae Whitman. Finally, Adam Scott will return to the network that helped him execute The Greatest Event In Television History for a '60s-set untitled special about Scott and comedian Jon Daly—as themselves—playing in an intense golf tournament.

As for the new pilots, there's a dark Mister Rogers parody called Neighbor's House (co-created by Childrens Hospital's Brian Huskey and Jason Mantzoukas), a show about an “upstart terrorist organization” called Bad Guys, and “a contemporary Soul Train” called The Pound Hole that the official description says will have “surreal, and sometimes violent, but always danceable situations.” The one we're most excited about, though, is Ballmastrz 9669, a crazy take on Rollerball from Superjail!'s Christy Karacas that takes place “inside giant battle arenas” where “teams of Ballmastrz” compete to win “The Game.”
Adult Swim also announced that a bunch of its current original shows will be returning for new seasons, including Childrens Hospital, The Eric Andre Show, The Jack And Triumph Show, Rick And Morty, and The Venture Brothers—the last of which we'll believe when we see it. The full list of new shows and returning shows can be found at The Wrap.
But even such a dramatic house cleaning doesn't change the reality: a large number of organizations focused on achieving a single goal – however desirable that goal – makes achieving that goal more difficult. That's certainly the case in corporate management, where such an approach typically results in fragmented markets and reduced market share for an ever-larger number of market participants. Of course, in the for-profit world, there are any number of solutions to the problem of too many companies competing for the same customers. Companies, for a variety of reasons, fail all the time. And as part of that process, their investors and shareholders lose their investment and, in theory, become smarter about where and how to invest the next time.
Yes, I'm aware that nonprofits sometimes close their doors and disappear. I also know that in 2011 the IRS revoked the tax-exempt status of some 275,000 nonprofit groups for failing to file an annual information return or notice with the agency for three consecutive years.
As someone who came to a second career in nonprofit management after working at some of the best-known consumer products companies in the world, I'd ask that we carefully consider whether there might simply be too many small nonprofits and charities in the United States for them all to be effective.
Every year, Americans start thousands of nonprofit organizations. Some are dedicated to eradicating disease, others to addressing social issues such as poverty, homelessness, or gun violence. In fact, according to the Urban Institute , the number of registered nonprofits in the United States grew some 25 percent , to 1.57 million, between 2001 and 2011.
PhilanTopic is on vacation this week. While we're away, we'll be sharing some of our favorite posts from the last year or three. This post was originally published in April 2014. Enjoy.
In contrast, an over-supply of small nonprofits and charities typically leads to duplication of effort, an ever-growing percentage of scarce resources devoted to overhead, an overall reduction in funding for new ideas and approaches (i.e., R&D), and, critically, more competition for donor funding and other kinds of support.
I'm not suggesting that the nonprofit sector should operate like the for-profit sector. Nor am I dismissing the possibility that large organizations can have a significant impact on a major social, environmental, or health issue. They can, and have…but largely because they have the resources to bring to bear on a problem that small nonprofits and charities simply lack.
Yes, a small nonprofit that employs new social media or crowdsourcing tools, or one that has a better solution to a problem, may grow up to become the twenty-first century equivalent of the Red Cross or American Heart Association. Every iconic nonprofit with which you are familiar was, at one point in time, a start-up. That's the alluring promise of the nonprofit sector – the possibility of creating an innovative solution to a problem that will improve the human condition.
No, what I am saying is that we all need to take a long, hard look at the sector's long-standing tendency to reinvent the wheel. Think about the tens of thousands of new tax-exempt organizations that will be created this year and ask yourself: How much thought did the founders of those nonprofits give to the question of whether a larger, more established organization could do the same thing they're hoping to do, but better? And what are the chances that any of those new nonprofits will ever have a significant impact on the problem they were founded to address?
As I see it, there's a related question: Why are so many larger, better established nonprofit organizations perfectly content to operate in silos, fenced off from ideas and new approaches pioneered by others? Why is there so little collaboration in the nonprofit space? Has the explosion of nonprofits over the last decade or two turned fundraising into a zero-sum game?
Speaking both as a leader of a large human services nonprofit and as an individual who believes deeply in the sector's potential to come up with innovative solutions to some of our biggest problems, I urge you to consider these questions – and to think twice before taking the plunge and starting your own nonprofit.
At the end of the day, only you can decide whether the expenditure of time and energy, and the financial support of your donors, is the best and most effective way to advance the cause you care about. Just remember: there are others out there doing the same thing who would welcome your passion and contributions to the cause.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. plan to train Ukrainian national guard troops is “on hold” pending implementation of a ceasefire deal between government troops and Russian-backed rebels, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Europe said on Friday.
The training mission, first announced in August last year, had been due to start this month. One battalion of U.S. soldiers is due to train three Ukrainian National Guard battalions.
A U.S. military official, speaking to Reuters on Friday on condition of anonymity, said the training mission had not yet been finalised.
Later on Friday, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Europe, confirmed the delay in a statement and said: “The U.S. government would like to see the Minsk agreement fulfilled.”
“The training mission is currently on hold but Army Europe is prepared to carry out the mission if and when our government decides to move forward,” the statement said.
At least 40 migrants have died in the hold of a boat in the Mediterranean, probably from suffocation, the Italian news agency ANSA reported on aturday.
The Italian navy confirmed the deaths but gave no other details. It said the naval vessel Cigala Fulgosi was leading the rescue mission and had saved many other people.
ANSA said the boat was 21 miles off the coast of Libya and carrying about 400 migrants.
Seperatelty, migrants on a Turkish beach scuffled over places on one inflatable dinghy and frantically bailed out another to keep it from sinking during a dramatic night that highlighted their desperation to reach the Greek island of Kos - and the safety of Europe.
The scenes of human trafficking, captured early Saturday by Associated Press journalists on a moonless night, came as Turkish authorities reported that 2,791 migrants have been caught in the Aegean Sea in the past 5 days alone, most of them Syrians.
Overall, more than 33,000 migrants have been caught or rescued in the Aegean this year, according to the governor's office in Izmir.
Kos is only 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from Turkey at its closest point, its twinkling lights at night an irresistible beacon to those fleeing war or poverty.
Tensions were high early Saturday at Fenerburnu Beach near the Turkish tourist town of Bodrum. Two migrants tried to clamber onto a small dinghy only to be forced off by angry fellow passengers, one of whom shouted: "You haven't paid!" One passenger was also upset that the male intruders had touched the arm of a female migrant wearing an Islamic headscarf.
The two ejected migrants fled up the beach and into the bushes just as a Turkish military police vehicle, its siren wailing, approached.
Earlier, in the darkness well away from the shore, two migrant smuggling boats appeared to be intercepted by another vessel and their passengers taken into custody. It was not immediately clear if Greek authorities were once again intercepting migrants at sea.
Later in the night, another inflatable dinghy setting off from the beach appeared close to sinking under the weight of its human cargo, which included at least one of the men forced off the earlier vessel. Three women jumped out and ran away shouting "No, no, no!," clearly terrified at the prospect of making even the short crossing to Kos in the flimsy boat.
Their panic spread to other passengers, leaving just four men to bail out the water using only plastic paddles. Then, using a tiny electric motor, they steered the boat toward the lights of Kos. As the dinghy gathered speed, three men who had earlier abandoned ship waded through the warm water to clamber back on board.
Asked if they had anything to say as they faded into the night, one man replied: "May God help us."
The number of migrants trying to reach Europe by sea is on track to hit a record this year, according to the Geneva-based International Organization for Migration.
Financially struggling Greece has reported 134,988 arrivals from Turkey this year, it said, while Italy recorded 93,540 newcomers through July. Along with migrants landing in Spain and Malta, 237,000 people have made the crossing so far this year, the agency says - compared to 219,000 for all of 2014.
It also estimated at least 2,300 people have died this year trying to make the crossing.

What we can expect ...
... From the Falcons
Atlanta has the league's most potent offense, according to Football Outsiders. Though anyone with just one good eye could confirm as much after watching what they did to the Seahawks and Packers on their way to Houston. The conversation starts with quarterback Matt Ryan, who should have been handed the league MVP award seconds after the NFC Championship Game ended. During the regular season he threw for 4,944 yards, with 38 touchdowns and seven interceptions. Ryan completed 70 percent of his passes with a passer rating of 117.1. In two playoff games he's been even better, completing 71 percent of his throws with seven touchdowns, no turnovers and a passer rating of 132.6.
Then there's Kyle Shanahan, the 37-year-old offensive coordinator. He joined the Falcons in 2015, and in less than two seasons, he's transformed an inconsistent squad into the NFL's most explosive unit.
Here's Ryan, mic'd up during the '15 seasons, talking to Shanahan: "I can't wait until I know the offense inside and out though, bro, because we are going to kill people with it."
And here's Ryan on Tuesday: "I felt like once I would get to that point, we would do really, really good things. And we have," he told 680 The Fan, via MercuryNews.com. "I feel like it's been a good relationship between Kyle and myself. ... He does a great job of putting people in position to be successful and giving a defense a lot of different things they have to defend."
And that brings us to the Patriots
Bill Belichick will take away the Falcons' best player. This isn't news, and in fact, it's almost become a cliche at this point. But it's also true. Which means that the Patriots' defense will focus on stopping Julio Jones, and then the Falcons' potent running game. Those are tall tasks, even for a defense fresh off demoralizing a very good Steelers' offense, though you could argue that Tom Brady and Chris Hogan (!) were the reasons the Pats cruised to an easy win in the AFC Championship Game.
Either way, the Falcons ain't the Steelers on either side of the ball.
"We saw [Jones] a couple years ago and studied him; he's one of the most dynamic players in the league," defensive coordinator Matt Patricia said, via ESPN.com. "He can run underneath routes, has great speed, great hands, body control and is very, very strong. He gives you a lot of problems."
"I'd say the stamp on the team, the thing that I would notice the most is just the speed, the team speed that the Falcons have," Belichick said during a conference call with reporters. "They have a lot of fast guys. Defensively they close up space very quickly. Their linebackers run well. Their defensive line, although they have a couple of big, strong, physical guys in there, overall they have usually nine or 10 players on the field that I would say are fast. They're either as fast or faster than probably what the average speed of their position is in the league. I'd say that's a big stamp that he has put on the team."
Of course, the Pats have Brady, who spearheaded the league's No. 2 offense, not to mention a defense that has shown steady improvement as the season has progressed. The biggest reason? Belichick had a simple explanation.
"Preparation, practice, execution," he said. "There's no magic wand. You've just got to go out there and, look, there are five eligible receivers. Usually we get at least four of them out [running pass patterns]. In man-to-man coverage you've got to cover them. We've got to rush the passer, contain the quarterback, stop the run."
Prisco's pick, betting line
"[Taking away Julio Jones] would normally slow an offense, but not this Falcons offense, which is why I think they win this game. They averaged more than 40 points in two games without Jones this year. Matt Ryan also threw touchdown passes to 13 different players, a league record. In a battle of the top-ranked scoring offense and the top-ranked scoring defense, I think the offense will get the best of it here. Ryan has too many weapons."
-- Pete Prisco on why he thinks the Falcons will take down the Patriots
According SportsLine, the Patriots are three-point favorites over the Falcons. The over-under is 58.5, the highest ever for a Super Bowl.
Meanwhile, five of the eight CBSSports.com experts are picking the Falcons to beat the Patriots in the Super Bowl.
Prop bets
It's the Super Bowl, which means prop bets are all the rage. One of the most popular: Over-under on the length of the national anthem. Country star Luke Bryan will sing the anthem at Super Bowl LI and depending on which sportsbook you consult, he will take anywhere from 2 minutes to 2 minutes, 15 seconds. Bryan, who has sung the anthem at previous public events, has been clocked as fast at 1:59 and as slow as 2:29. So place your bets accordingly.
There are also the cross-sport prop bets. Here are some of the more interesting ones, courtesy of the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook (by way of ESPN.com):
Tiger Woods' 18-hole score in the Omega Dubai Desert Classic or Brady's gross passing yards (Brady is favored by 18.5).
LeBron James' total points in the Cavs-Knicks game on Feb. 4 or Matt Ryan's Super Bowl completions. (This is a pick 'em).
Total goals in Leicester City-Manchester United match or the total touchdowns for the Patriots and Falcons (The line is pick'em and both sides are -110).
More fun (and not so fun) facts
If the Patriots lose, they're all-time Super Bowl record will drop to 4-5, tying them with the Broncos (3-5) for most losses in Super Bowl history.
If the Pats win, they'd move into a tie for second place (with the Cowboys and 49ers) for Super Bowl victories behind only the Steelers.
Since division realignment in 2002, only the NFC South has sent every team to the Super Bowl.
The Falcons have scored a touchdown on their opening drive in eight straight games.
Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan has thrown at least three touchdown passes in four straight postseason games -- that's an NFL record.

For a number of years I've had the pleasure of serving as a judge at wine competitions. Additionally, I've served as a judge of cider. Whenever at a wine competition, I always encourage the competition organizers to work toward including a cider category. I do this because I believe competitions not only serve to help publicize the continually increasing number of fine ciders in the market and help promote cider in general, but it also gives the judges, who are often influential people in the beverage world, a chance to delve deeper into the variety of cider in the market.
For these reason, I was very happy to learn that The Good Food Awards, now in its sixth year, has added a cider category. In the past, The Good Food Awards encouraged cidermakers to enter their products, but they fell into the beer category. Not any more.
The Good Food Awards is also distinguished by the fact that it seeks to honor foods, and ciders, that focus on minimal intervention during production and on authentic ingredients. In fact The Good Food Awards pay attention to cideries that:
• Seeks out ingredients that are grown or produced with practices that promote resource conservation and minimize synthetic inputs, including pesticides, herbicides and fungicides.
• Seeks out fruit and other ingredients that are grown locally and with respect to seasonality as a top priority.
• Does not use artificial flavorings.
• Does not use concentrates as a primary source of sugar for fermentation.
• Seeks to know their suppliers and customers in order to support and promote sustainability
CLICK HERE FOR CIDERIES SEEKING TO ENTER THEIR CIDER INTO THE 2016 GOOD FOOD AWARDS
Cider competitions have played an important role in drawing attention to conscientious cider makers and to the best ciders in the market. And cideries have embraced these competitions too as a way to find ways to promote their own efforts. At this years granddaddy of cider competitions, the Great Lakes International Cider and Perry Association Competition, 480 separate ciders were entered. SEE THE RESULTS HERE.
The Pacific North West Cider Awards also an important competition for cideries located in Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, Idaho and Montana. CLICK HERE TO SEE THE LATEST ROUND OF AWARD-WINNING CIDERS.
Other competitions that include cider occur around the globe and also here in the U.S.—though usually associated with beer competitions.
However, the real winner where competitions are concerned are consumers who are looking to broaden their horizons where cider is concerned. The list of award-winning ciders wills almost always include names consumers have never heard of and new ciders that consumers can then seek out.
Rep. Kerry Bentivolio [R-MI] says impeaching Obama would be 'a dream come true' [YouTube]
Freshman Tea Party Rep. Kerry Bentivolio (R-MI) told a constituent on Monday that filing articles of impeachment against President Barack Obama “would be a dream come true,” while warning constituents he needed the right evidence to do so.
Think Progress reported on Wednesday that video of a town hall meeting hosted by Bentivolio shows him responding to a woman's request that he and Congress “stop Obama from everything that he's doing against our Constitution.” The woman also told Benivolio that the “runaway train” in the White House was making her nervous.
“If I could write that bill and submit it, it would be a dream come true,” Bentivolio said in response. “I feel your pain. I stood 12 feet away from the guy and listened to him. I couldn't stand being there, but because he is president I have to respect the office. That's my job, as a Congressman. I respect the office.”
Bentivolio also said he has directly asked lawyers and “PhDs in history” what he can do to begin the impeachment process against Obama, only to be told he needs evidence. He specifically mentioned a scenario in which he could obtain an email from Obama's chief of staff, Denis McDonough, to former Internal Revenue Service official Lois Lerner ordering the IRS to target conservative political groups, revisiting a Republican talking point that has been regularly debunked.
“Until we have evidence, you're gonna become a laughingstock if you [submit] a bill to impeach the President,” Bentivolio explained. “Because, number one, you've gotta convince the press. And there are some people our there, no matter what Obama does, he's still the greatest president they've ever had.”

One Markham councillor walked out and a colleague expressed her displeasure about another secret council meeting on Monday that included discussion about the city's controversial $325-million arena plan and an “identifiable individual.” “I'm sick and tired of all these in camera meetings,” said regional Councillor Jim Jones after leaving the session at the Markham Civic Centre. “There is no need for this. The public has a right to know what's going on.”
Markham Regional Councillor Jim Jones.
“We can try to defend ourselves as much as possible by going in camera, but the fact is the public is not happy about it,” added Councillor Valerie Burke, about the prospect of a secret session. “I'm not happy to be here.” But Mayor Frank Scarpitti pointed out that council has a good track record in keeping meetings public whenever possible and holding secret sessions only when necessary. Monday's meeting again raised the ire of the Markham Village Ratepayers Association, which has criticized partial public funding of the proposed 20,000-seat, NHL-size arena and involvement of promoter Graeme Roustan, chief executive officer of GTA Sports and Entertainment.

“Let's stop the in camera meetings,” association president Karen Rae told council before it moved into the secret session. “Be honest, open and transparent.” As part of the deal, councillors agreed not to release reports about the arena's viability as a business. Council is seeking a second legal opinion on that decision. The city's refusal to release the reports has prompted the ratepayers association to take its fight to Ontario's Information and Privacy Commissioner. Councillors also signed confidentiality deals in the fall of 2010 and early 2011 to not disclose details of the project and the financial structure for more than a year. Although councillors would not say what they decided at Monday's meeting, sources said council finally agreed to conduct due-diligence work on the proponents of the project: prominent local developer Rudy Bratty and Roustan.
Councillors would not disclose the “identifiable individual” on the meeting agenda but people familiar with the session suggested it was Roustan, who has faced questions about his business background and a claim that he was a “finalist” to buy the iconic Montreal Canadiens in 2009. Councillors have not publicly voiced any concerns about Bratty. Roustan, former chairman of Bauer Performance Sports, and Mayor Scarpitti have insisted the arena promoter was a finalist for the franchise.

Roustan told at least one councillor recently he would be providing information to council that would verify the claim and boost his credibility. But Jones, a veteran councillor and a former MP, said Roustan's claims about the Canadiens and other achievements are filled with “distortions.” Roustan's company did not respond to an email seeking comment. Quoting sources close to the auction process, the Star reported last fall that Roustan was never a finalist and didn't make any formal bid for the franchise. Former partners and customers have also criticized his past business practices in interviews. Earlier this year, the Texas Supreme Court upheld two lower court decisions that found Roustan committed statutory fraud in an arena deal with a Fort Worth couple several years ago. Late last year, Roustan said the public hears little about his successes but more about arenas that fail because they end up in court. “I rescued some,” he said. “Others were too far gone, and that's what gets the negative publicity.” The financial structure of the arena project contemplates the city borrowing $325 million and GTA Sports paying back half over 20 years. Markham would introduce a series of development levies to cover its costs and avoid any property tax increases. Under the arrangement, GTA Sports would be responsible for construction and management of the arena near Highway 407 and Kennedy Rd., while the city would own it. That has raised fears among some residents about being on the hook for any annual losses.

Disgaea 5 Is In Pre-Production, Fans Vote For Their Favorite NIS Games
By Sunjun . July 15, 2013 . 5:20pm
Nippon Ichi Software CEO Sohei Niikawa recently told Dengeki Online that the scenario of Disgaea 5 is currently in its preparation stage. Although the game is only in the early stages, he intends for it to surpass the first Disgaea.
This comes after the results of a survey by Dengeki in which fans voted for their favorite NIS games, excluding ports. The top 15 games are:
1. Disgaea
2. Disgaea 4
3. Disgaea 2
4. Disgaea D2
5. Soul Nomad & the World Eaters
6. Disgaea 3
7. Phantom Brave
8. Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure
8. Prinny 2: Dawn of Operation Panties, Dood!
8. Prinny: Can I Really Be the Hero?
11. Criminal Girls
12. Z.H.P. Unlosing Ranger vs. Darkdeath Evilman
13. Makai Kingdom
14. The Guided Fate Paradox
15. Little Princess: The Puppet Princess of Marl Kingdom 2
Niikawa stated that he will use these results as a reference, and if he was to make a Disgaea 4 D2, he would hope surpasses the original Disgaea 4.
Also, Niikawa added that he is happy that the Hayarigami horror mystery series still has a strong fanbase (the first Hayarigami ranked #16).
Along with that series, he will consider turning standalone games in the top 15 into series, Niikawa said.

Everyone has their own specialism. Whereas Bach excelled on the keyboard, Vivaldi ruled on the violin. Even more importantly, Vivaldi was the composer par excellence of the solo concerto. His music travelled throughout Europe and all the way to Bach's home. Johann Sebastian Bach arranged various Vivaldi concertos (sometimes thoroughly) from opus 3, 4 and 7, for organ and harpsichord. He used one of them – the Concerto in B minor from L'estro armonico (opus 3) for four violins and orchestra – more or less in its entirety. But of course he gave it an exciting twist, as in Bach's version the soloists play harpsichords and B minor changed to A minor.
Unfortunately, we do not know how the Concert for four harpsichords in A minor originated, although we can hazard a guess. If it was ‘born' around 1730, Bach could have arranged the concerto for (or improvised it in) the Zimmermannsches Kaffeehaus, where he led the Leipziger Collegium Musicum. And with no fewer than five harpsichords at home, it could also have been a family affair, with father Bach sharing the stage with three of his children.
It was most probably an exciting challenge to expand four single solo lines into four complete keyboard parts for two hands; from four strings to dozens of them. Bach's extra notes often supplement those of Vivaldi, but where the accompaniment permits, he likes to use them in dialogue. This is very clear in the closing phase of the first movement, as repeated chords explode in Bach's hands in a crisscross of melodic motifs. The most impressive movement – and the most faithful to the original – is the second, which is full of broken chords that gain incredible power and richness when transposed from violin to harpsichord.
Which clock is the best?
We can easily rule the one which has stopped …
Or can we? In “The Rectory Umbrella” Lewis Carroll argues otherwise.
Which is better, a clock that is right only once a year, or a clock that is right twice every day? “The latter,” you reply, “unquestionably.” Very good, now attend. I have two clocks: one doesn't go at all, and the other loses a minute a day: which would you prefer? “The losing one,” you answer, “without a doubt.” Now observe: the one which loses a minute a day has to lose twelve hours, or seven hundred and twenty minutes before it is right again, consequently it is only right once in two years, whereas the other is evidently right as often as the time it points to come round, which happens twice a day.
It's an amusing diversion, but not really that puzzling: of course the clock which loses time is of more practical use, even if, somewhat paradoxically, the less time it loses the less often it tells the right time. A clock which loses just a second a day only tells the right time every 118 years or so.
I mention these defective clocks because I'm thinking about bugs in software and how we go about finding and fixing them.
Code which is obviously wrong is easier to spot than code which is almost right, and spotting bugs is the precursor to fixing them. This implies — building on Carroll's terminology — that we're unlikely to ship many stopped clocks but if we're not careful we may end up delivering a few which lose time. And, in general, code which is obviously wrong is easier to fix than code which is almost right. A badly-broken function clearly needs a rethink; whereas one which almost works may simply get tweaked until it appears to work, often resulting in a more subtle bug.
C and C++ provide a good example of what I'm talking about. Consider a program which misuses memory. An attempt to allocate workspace of 4294967295 bytes fails instantly[1]; a slow memory leak, like a slow running clock, may cause no perceptible damage for an extended period.
Decent tools detect memory leaks. Race conditions in multi-threaded code are harder to track and may prove elusive during system testing. More than once I've left a program running under a debugger, being fed random inputs, in the hope some rare and apparently random condition will trigger a break in execution. Give me truly broken code any day!
Here are two implementations of a C function to find an integer midway between a pair of ordered, positive integer values, truncating downwards. Before reading on, ask yourself which is better.
int midpoint1(int low, int high) { return low/2 + high/2; } int midpoint2(int low, int high) { return (low + high)/2; }
Midpoint1 is a “stopped clock”, returning 3 instead of 4 as the mid-point of 3 and 5, for example. It gets the wrong answer 25% of the time — fatally wrong were it to be used at the heart of, say, a binary search. I think we'd quickly detect the problem.
An obvious fix would be the one shown in midpoint2 which does indeed return 4 as the mid-point of 3 and 5.
Midpoint2 turns out to be a losing clock, though. If the sum low + high overflows then the result is undefined. On my implementation I get a negative value — a dangerous thing to use as an array index. This is a notorious and very real defect, nicely documented in a note by Joshua Bloch subtitled “Nearly all Binary Searches and Mergesorts are broken”.
Bloch offers more than one fix so I'll just note here that:
this defect simply doesn't exist in a high-level language like Python or Haskell, where integers are bounded only by machine resources
I think Bloch is unfair to suggest Jon Bentley's analysis in chapter 4 of Programming Pearls is wrong. The pseudo-code in this chapter is written in a C-like language somewhere between C and Python, and in fact one of Bentley's exercises is to examine what effect word size has on this analysis.
in a sense, midpoint2 is more broken than midpoint1 : over the range of possible low and high inputs, the sum overflows and triggers the defect 50% of the time.
Computers are supposed to be predictable and we typically aim for correct programs. There's no reason why we shouldn't consider aiming for programs which are good enough, though, and indeed many programs which are good enough to be useful are also flawed. Google adverts, for example, analyse the contents of web pages and serve up related links. The algorithm used is secret, clever and quick, but often results in semantic blunders and, on occasion, offensive mistakes. Few could deny how useful to Google this program has been, though.
Here's a more interesting example of an algorithm which, like a losing clock, is nearly right.
def is_fprime(n): """Use Fermat's little theorem to guess if n is prime. """ from random import randrange tries = 3 xs = (randrange(1, n) for _ in range(tries)) return all((x ** n) % n == x for x in xs)
We won't go into the mathematics here. A quick play with this function looks promising.
>>> all(is_fprime(n) for n in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]) True >>> any(is_fprime(n) for n in [4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15]) False
In fact, if we give it a real work-out on some large numbers, it does well. I used it to guess which of the numbers between 100000 and 102000 were prime, comparing the answer with the correct result (the code is at the end of this article). It had a better than 99% success rate (in clock terms, it lost around 8 minutes a day) and increasing tries will boost its performance.
The better is_fprime performs, the less likely we are to spot that it's wrong. What's worse, though, is that it cannot be fixed by simple tweaking. However high we set tries we won't have a correct function. We could even take the random probing out of the function and shove every single value of x in the range 1 to n into the predicate:
def exhaustive_is_fprime(n): return all((x ** n) % n == x for x in range(1, n))
Exhaustive_is_fprime is expensive to run and will (very) occasionally return True for a composite number[2]. If you want to know more, search for Carmichael numbers.
The point I'm making is that code which is almost right can be dangerous. We are tempted to fix it by adjusting the existing implementation, even if, as in this case, a complete overhaul is required. By contrast, we all know what needs doing with code which is plainly wrong.
We've all seen nervous functions which go beyond their stated interface in an attempt to protect themselves from careless users.
/** * Return the maximum value found in the input array. * Pre-condition: the input array must not be empty. */ int nervy_maximum_value(int const * items, size_t count) { int M = -INT_MAX; if (items == NULL || count == 0) { return M; } for ( ; count-- != 0; ++items) { if (*items > M) { M = *items; } } return M; }
What's really wanted is both simpler and easier for clients to code against.
int maximum_value(int const * items, size_t count) { int const * const end = items + count; int M = *items++; for ( ; items != end; ++items) { if (*items > M) { M = *items; } } return M; }
Did you spot the subtle bug in nervy_maximum_value ? It uses -INT_MAX instead of INT_MIN which will cause trouble if clients code against this undocumented behaviour; if nervy_maximum_value is subsequently fixed, this client code back-fires.
Note that I'm not against the use of assertions to check pre-conditions, and a simple assert(items != NULL && count != 0) works well in maximum_value ; it's writing code which swallows these failed pre-conditions I consider wrong.
The occurrence of defects in complex software systems can be modelled in the same way as radioactive decay. I haven't studied this theory and my physics is rusty[3], but the basic idea is that the population of bugs in some software is rather like a population of radioactive particles. Any given bug fires (any given particle decays) at random, so we can't predict when this event will happen, but it is equally likely to fire at any particular time. This gives each defect an average lifetime: a small lifetime for howling defects, such as dereferencing NULL pointers, and a longer one for more subtle problems, such as accumulated rounding errors. Assuming we fix a bug once it occurs, the population of defects decays exponentially, and we get the classic tailing-off curve.
Anyone who has ever tried to release a software product knows how it feels to slide down the slope of this curve. We system test, find bugs, fix them, repeat. At the start it can be exhilarating as bugs with short half-lives fall out and get squashed, but the end game is demoralising as defects get reported which then cannot be reproduced, and we find ourselves clawing out progress. When we eventually draw the line and ship the product we do so suspecting the worst problems are yet to be found. To put it more succinctly[4].
Ship happens!
A combination of techniques can help us escape this depressing picture. The most obvious one would be to avoid it: rather than aim for “big-bang” releases every few years, we can move towards continual and incremental delivery. A modular, decoupled architecture helps. So does insistence on unit testing. Rather than shake the system and sweep up the bugs which fall off we should develop a suite of automated tests which actively seek the various paths through the code, and exercise edge cases. Within the code-base, as already mentioned, defensive programming can cause defects to become entrenched. Instead, we should adopt a more confident style, where code fails hard and fast.
Have you ever fixed a defect and wondered how the code ever even appeared to work before your fix? It's an important question and one which requires investigation. Perhaps the bug you've fixed is compensated for by defensive programming elsewhere. Or perhaps there are vast routes through the code which have yet to be exercised.
None of these clocks is much better. The first has stopped, the second loses a second every minute, the third gains a second every minute. At least it's easy to see the problem with the first: we won't be tempted to patch it.
We should never expect our code to work first time and we should be suspicious if it appears to do so. Defensive programming seems to mean different things to different people. If I've misused the term here, I'm sorry. Our best defence is to assume code is broken until we've tested it, to assume it will break in future if our tests are not automated, and to fail hard and fast when we detect errors.

[1] In the first version of this article I wrote that an attempt to allocate 4294967295 bytes would cause the program to crash, which isn't quite right. Malloc returns NULL in the event of failure; standard C++ operator new behaviour is to throw a bad_alloc exception. My thanks to R Samuel Klatchko for the correction.
[2] “Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs” discusses Carmichael numbers in a footnote
Numbers that fool the Fermat test are called Carmichael numbers, and little is known about them other than that they are extremely rare. There are 255 Carmichael numbers below 100,000,000. The smallest few are 561, 1105, 1729, 2465, 2821, and 6601. In testing primality of very large numbers chosen at random, the chance of stumbling upon a value that fools the Fermat test is less than the chance that cosmic radiation will cause the computer to make an error in carrying out a “correct” algorithm. Considering an algorithm to be inadequate for the first reason but not for the second illustrates the difference between mathematics and engineering.
[3] Being lazy and online I thought I'd search for a nice radioactive decay graphic rather than draw my own. I found a real gem on the University of Colarado site, where Kyla and Bob discuss radioactive decay.
Hmmm…so a lot of decays happen really fast when there are lots of atoms, and then things slow down when there aren't so many. The halflife is always the same, but the half gets smaller and smaller. That's exactly right. Here's another applet that illustrates radioactive decay in action.
Visit the site to play with the applet Bob mentions. You'll find more Kyla and Bob pictures there too.
[4] I'm unable to provide a definitive attribution for the “Ship happens!” quotation. I first heard it from Andrei Alexandrescu at an ACCU conference, who in turn thinks he got it from Erich Gamma. I haven't managed to contact Erich Gamma. Matthew B. Doar reports using the term back in 2002, and it appears as a section heading in his book “Practical Development Environments”.
BETHLEHEM, Pa. - A news conference is scheduled for 10 a.m. to reveal more information in the shooting that wounded a state trooper in Northampton County Tuesday. Watch it live on 69 News, WFMZ.com or Facebook.com/69WFMZ.
Officials said what should have been a simple traffic stop turned into a violent fight and shootout in Plainfield Township, Northampton County.
Police say a Pennsylvania state trooper pulled over a man for speeding Tuesday around 10 a.m. on Route 33 southbound near Route 191.
After issuing the man a ticket, police said he was free to go.
Instead, they say the man, identified as Daniel Clary, 22, got out of the car to ask how to pay for the ticket. That's when the trooper noticed Clary seemed under the influence and called for backup.
"They had the subject get out of his car and they started doing a field sobriety test on the subject," said Capt. Rich D'Ambrosio, commander of the Troop M barracks in Bethlehem.
But when the trooper began the arrest, Clary freed himself and began violently fighting the troopers.
"It was a knockout, drag-out fight along the side of the road with vehicles speeding by, and he got very, very violent. I saw the confrontation on video already and it was a very violent fight," D'Ambrosio said.
Officials said Clary then ran back to his car, grabbed a gun, and shot at the troopers, hitting one three times.
The troopers were able to return fire, but Clary, who was shot, got in his car and sped off. Officials said he drove himself to Easton Hospital and was taken into police custody. A car with its back windows shot out was seen outside the emergency room there.
69 News A viewer shared dashcam video of the suspect's car, with its back window shot out, fleeing the scene of the shooting on Route 33 in Northampton County.
Clary was taken to Lehigh Valley Hospital - Cedar Crest and underwent surgery.
Meanwhile, emergency responders transported the state police corporal to St. Luke's University Hospital in Fountain Hill where he underwent surgery.
As of Tuesday afternoon he was in extremely critical but stable condition.
"I cannot thank the staff at St. Luke's enough, and the EMTs, the officers, the life flight crew, and the doctors at St. Luke's because without them this press conference would be, I'm almost certain, the death of a trooper. Right now our guy is up there fighting for his life," D'Ambrosio said during a Tuesday afternoon press conference.
What's this!? A new update on Not a Clone!? Yup, we finally have something new to show off since the brainstorming sketches nearly three weeks ago.
First, the graphics in the clones formerly known as Not Angry Things and Not Angry Disks has been changed to Angry Monkeys and Angry Thieves respectively. Why? Well, you might recall the old minigames looked something like this:
Now they look like this:
And the renaming seemed appropriate. Thanks again to Astra Wijaya for the graphical improvements.
On a different note, I believe I haven't introduced the rest of the team members working on this project. We're a four-men team, consisting of:
Myself, Taro Omiya, as the game designer and programmer (and the creator of the original game) Astra Wijaya, naturally, as the artist Chase Bethea as the sound designer and lastly, Dylan Bramblett as programmer.
I'm going to do my best to give some highlights to other features implemented in the game so that other team members can get their spotlight, too. First, Dylan put together a translation interface that reads in a spreadsheet like the one below:
And turns it into texts that changes based on the player's language settings. Since we're early in development, there haven't been any translations outside of Pig Latin. Still, when we do finalize every text in the game, we should be able to translate the game to other languages very quickly.
Here's to hoping the next update will come quickly (without E3 bothering us).

Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have spoken on the phone
Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have agreed they will work together to tackle international terrorism and extremism, the Kremlin says.
The two men spoke for the first time on the telephone since Mr Trump's unexpected election victory last Tuesday, with the Kremlin adding they will work towards "constructive co-operation" to improve "the extremely unsatisfactory state of Russian-US relations at present".
Moscow said the pair would continue contact by phone but would not be meeting before Mr Trump is inaugurated as President on 20 January next year.
A Kremlin spokesman said Syria and the Crimea were not among the topics discussed during the first call.

A possible thawing of East-West relations appeared to be having an effect when NATO also appeared to reach out by saying the military alliance wanted more discussions with Russia.
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: "The message from NATO has been that we want dialogue with Russia.
"Russia is our biggest neighbour, Russia is there to stay and especially when tensions run high and especially when we face many different security challenges, it is important to have dialogue."
Image: Relations between Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama have become strained
Mr Trump will enter the White House as relations between Barack Obama and Mr Putin have become strained over several issues including the Syrian war, where the countries back different sides.
There has also been tension in recent years over the Ukraine conflict, while allegations of Russian cyberattacks featured in the election campaign.
Mr Trump's team said he and Mr Putin discussed a range of issues including the threats and challenges facing the United States and Russia, strategic economic issues and the historical US-Russia relationship.
Putin will wait to see if Trump is 'real deal'
A statement added: "President-elect Trump noted to President Putin that he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia."
During the election race, Mr Trump had warm words for the Russian president, suggesting he was a stronger leader than Mr Obama.
When asked how he would be able to change Mr Putin's stance on key issues, Mr Trump said he thought he could.
He said: "I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Putin, and I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Russia."
After Mr Trump won the election, Mr Putin said Russia was ready to do its part to fully restore ties with Washington.
Putin: Moscow ready to restore good ties with US
Mr Trump's apparent warmth to Mr Putin and his election campaign comments that NATO was "obsolete" had led some European nations to express concern about his foreign policy.
President Obama, who is on his last tour of Europe before Mr Trump takes office, assured people in his first stop Greece on Tuesday that the US considers the NATO alliance a cornerstone of its security.
Mr Stoltenberg added that he was adamant that Ukraine's "territorial integrity" should never be violated and that he agreed with Mr Trump that European NATO members should step up their defence spending.
The UK Prime Minister Theresa May's spokeswoman said on Tuesday that Britain hopes to raise the issue of NATO with Mr Trump at any early engagement.
Cardinal Tobin's appointment in October as one of the nation's 18 cardinals came as a surprise to many, including the man himself. But perhaps it should not have. For what his unassuming bearing does not reveal is that he is no stranger to the corridors of power in the church. He is a friend of Pope Francis. And under Francis' predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, he had helped lead the Vatican office that oversees the roughly one million men and women in religious orders around the world.
That position did not end so well. It was an open secret that Cardinal Tobin was sent to Indiana as a kind of exile most likely because he questioned an inquiry by his office into supposed doctrinal lapses among the roughly 50,000 nuns in the United States. As he got to know the faithful in the chancery of Indianapolis, he would joke with them about it.
“I was kicked out and I'm grateful for it,” the chancellor of the archdiocese, Annette Lentz, recalled his saying about how he turned up on her doorstep. And she would tell him, “Their loss is our gain.”
How Cardinal Tobin, 64, an amiable 6-foot-3 Irish-American who likes Bob Seger, plays piano and speaks five languages, went from being the oldest of 13 children living in Detroit to the pinnacle of the global church is a story that bears telling.
He grew up in a working-class neighborhood where the big houses were perfect for the large families of Irish, Polish and other Eastern European backgrounds that filled them. The local parish, Holy Redeemer, was run by an order of priests called the Redemptorists, and was unusually large, with 14 Masses each Sunday for up to 20,000 worshipers, he recalled in a Dec. 5 interview.
His mother was a public-school teacher who quit her job to raise her brood; nine of her cousins and three of her aunts were nuns. Growing up in a deeply Catholic environment, Cardinal Tobin had two role models: the parish priests and his father, a cost analyst at General Motors who attended 6 a.m. Mass daily.
Joe Tobin was a rough-and-tumble child, who once crashed through the back-porch window when he was being chased. But he also learned the deeper lessons taught by the nuns at the parish school.
The Nashville Predators' first trip to the NHL Stanley Cup Finals has been something of a small-scale apocalypse to this point; the Western Conference champs were outscored 9-4 in two road losses to start the series.
No matter, the Preds will return home for Game 3 on Saturday night, and you can pretty much guarantee prominent members of the Tennessee Titans will be there to cheer them on. Titans players -- mostly offensive linemen but also quarterback Marcus Mariota -- have become a popular side attraction during Preds home games during the playoffs, hoisting fresh catfish (it's a hockey thing) and chugging beers for an adoring sellout crowd.
NBC brought some more exposure to this new tradition on Wednesday night when they aired some of the Titans' antics during the Western Conference Finals. Bro Party Rule No. 1: It ain't a bro party until a bro is shirtless.
The @Titans know how to watch a hockey game ï¿½ï¿½#StanleyCup pic.twitter.com/M180ldKNar â NHL on NBC (@NHLonNBCSports) June 1, 2017
Titans Pro Bowl tackle Taylor Lewan is the mastermind behind the madness.
"We get there, I have my catfish and me and the boys are talking, and I'm like, 'I'm gonna crank a beer after,'" he explained to WTVF-TV in Nashville. "And I was like, 'No, no, no, why don't we all just drink a beer? Let's all crank a beer together.' ... So the plan was to hold the catfish up, wait for the crowd to enjoy it, slam the catfish down and then all of us cheers and just crank it. It was just good, old-fashioned fun."
The Predators are 2-0 when the Titans big men crank beers in unison. Based on the first two games of the series, the home team will need all the good juju it can get.
By the way, not all local institutions can pull this type of revelry off. We see you, "Sex On Fire" bro.

The publisher of in-flight catalog SkyMall has filed for bankruptcy.
("Ireland - sky mall" by kelly taylor is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0.)
SkyMall LLC, the in-flight catalog company whose offerings include pedal laptop desks and automated ball- launchers for dogs, filed for bankruptcy citing a retail marketplace transformed by online merchants.
The marketer of more than 30,000 products distributed its catalog in airplane seat pockets, putting it in the hands of 650 million air travelers a year, according to the company website.
Idle air travelers could browse for novelty items such as an Ultrasonic Barking Dog Deterrent that looks like a birdhouse, for $49.95, or a replica of a 16th-century Italian globe based on nautical maps that doubles as a bar, for $189.

The company and its affiliates listed as much as $50 million in liabilities and as much as $10 million in assets in Chapter 11 filings in Phoenix Thursday.
"The direct marketing retail industry is crowded, rapidly evolving and intensely competitive," Chief Financial Officer Scott Wiley said in a court filing. He listed Amazon.com Inc. and EBay Inc. as among competitors with greater resources and more customers.

"With the increased use of electronic devices on planes, fewer people browsed the SkyMall in-flight catalog," Wiley said. New technology and the cost of getting the magazine on planes "made the traditional in-flight SkyMall catalog increasingly unattractive to the airlines," he said.
The business, which works as a distributor without maintaining its own inventories, generated $33.7 million of revenue in 2013, according to court filings.
The case is In re SkyMall LLC, 15-00679, U.S. bankruptcy Court, District of Arizona (Phoenix).

Topics and Questions For Discussion
When the author's agent initially asked the author who he thought the readers of his proposed book would be and he defensively replied, “Everyone,” do you think the author should have immediately realized that there is a thin line between everyone and no one?
Did the agent's pitch that the proposed book “brilliantly bridges genres” give the author license that caused him to, in the later words of his agent, “miss the boat” completely, by failing to inhabit any genre whatsoever?
Did the negligible advance justify the author's contention that he could “write what I liked,” without regard to the book's marketability, plausibility, or legibility?
Why do you think the agent stopped returning the author's phone calls?
Do you think the editor's decision to refrain from intervening in the text was an instance of the dereliction of standards in the publishing industry, or was it an indication of lingering prudence and respect for the practice of literature within what the author would invariably refer to as the “military-industrial publishing complex”?
Who or what do you think is most to blame for the failure of this book: the author, his agent, his publisher, the reading public, or the collapse of literacy in society as such?
Was the author's insistence that the plot was basically “pages from my diary” sufficient justification for the grossly sentimental predicaments in which the main character finds himself—predicaments that, as one critic for a prestigious newspaper suggested, “seem to define the meeting place between self-flagellation and contempt for the reader”?
Do you think that the rapid accumulation of zero-star reviews on Amazon in the aftermath of that review repudiates the old saw that “there's no such thing as bad publicity”?
At what point in this book did you stop reading? Why? Was it the overwrought language, or the underdeveloped plot? Was it the absence of sympathetic characters or the lack of an overarching thesis that most irritated you as a reader?
Do you think the author will ever recover from this latest confirmation of his complete irrelevance to the “cultural conversation”? At this point in his “career,” what would recovery even mean?
Did the author's wife know that the book was doomed from the start? If so, why did she nurture in the author the crazed delusion that it would “find its audience”? Is she now, in some sense, more responsible for its failure than the author is, as the author has argued in some imaginary interviews he has conducted with himself?
Was it appropriate for the author's wife to recoil physically when the author referred to the breakfast nook that he had made uninhabitable with his proliferating papers, filthy coffee receptacles, and discarded socks as “his study”?
What do you think will happen when the author bumps into the smug critic of his book at a party for another author's book? Will the author's dousing the critic in Merlot be viewed as a grand gesture in the tradition of Mailer and Hemingway, or will it be, as the author's wife will suggest on the sidewalk after they have been ejected from the party, another symptom of the chronic small-mindedness that undermined his work in the first place?
Should the author's wife have taken a cab home alone, or given her husband “another chance”?
Do you think it is fair for the author's wife's lawyer to demand half the author's paltry advance as part of her proposed divorce settlement, even though she knew full well that the advance had immediately been spent on regrouting the tiles in the bathroom?
Do you think the author's new life in a “shithole in Caracas” will endow his work with the atmosphere of authenticity he endlessly bitched about being lacking in brownstone Brooklyn?
Although training camp hasn't started yet, that hasn't stopped analysts and fans from making their season predictions already. They have their eyes set on certain teams that will succeed this year. Whether it's off-season improvements or favorable scheduling, the Atlanta Falcons have garnered buzz about being the favorite to win the NFC South. Due to being more conservative in free agency and a more difficult schedule, the Carolina Panthers have become somewhat forgotten about in the NFC South.
It was only seven months ago that Carolina embarrassed Atlanta to win the division. They pummeled Matt Ryan and made Atlanta's offensive line look amateurish. Charles Johnson felt that their front seven would be unstoppable, which came to fruition with six sacks and 12 quarterback hits. The ability to make Julio Jones into mostly a non-factor is an incredible achievement. Josh Norman's ability to cover man-to-man and the assistance of a daunting pass rush deserve credit for keeping the stud wide receiver quiet.
Everyone knows that the NFL has become a passing league. Besides Seattle and possibly Cincinnati, it's rare to see teams flourish without leaning towards a pass-first mentality. An above average quarterback and multiple productive players at the skill positions have proven to be vital for playoff-caliber teams. The second biggest attribute for most successful teams is usually having an outstanding front seven.
After losing Greg Hardy, Carolina's front seven was starting to get written off to an extent. That didn't remotely make sense to me. Luke Kuechly was the only player that received any credence for his exceptional play. Thomas Davis is a top five 4-3 outside linebacker, who has made a miraculous comeback from tearing his ACL on three occasions.. His ability to handle almost any coverage responsibility and be so effective on blitzes makes him a coach's dream. In a pass-first league, Davis is the ideal three-down versatile linebacker that every defense needs. Charles Johnson continues to be one of the better pass rushers in the league. Star Lotulelei has already ascended into becoming one of the best run-stuffing defensive tackles in a matter of two seasons. Kawann Short could be on the verge of becoming one of the best interior pass rushers as well.
As a unit, they combined for 40 sacks and forced 24 fumbles last season. That was considered a "down season" for this defense. With young players like Kony Ealy and Shaq Thompson developing as starters, Carolina has all the makings of an elite defensive unit. They are certainly a top ten defense, especially with Norman breaking out last season and Bene Benwikere emerging through the latter part of the season. Besides some question marks at safety, this defense is fully equipped to give opposing offenses nightmares.
Besides their stout defense, Carolina commands respect for having an array of offensive weapons. When it comes to excelling at both blocking and receiving as a tight end, it doesn't get much better than Greg Olsen. The reliable veteran constantly makes catches in traffic, along with being an asset in the running game. Olsen is a matchup nightmare based on his size being too overwhelming for safeties. His route running has left opposing linebackers overmatched as well. With Cam Newton being erratic with his accuracy at times, a safety blanket like Olsen has proven to be highly beneficial.
After Steve Smith's departure last season, many analysts were concerned about Newton's future and his development as a passer. The former number one pick did see a decline in his completion percentage last season. Blitzes tend to force him into making poor decisions far too often. While Carolina didn't make any major splashes, they are finally implementing the pieces to help Newton develop as a pocket passer.
Newton was far too reliant on Olsen and Kelvin Benjamin last year. Carolina made it a priority to draft Devin Funchess, who can certainly help resolve Newton's tendency to overthrow his receivers. That was clearly the gaudy move to take the pressure off Olsen and Benjamin. The big upgrade for Carolina's aerial attack will be the variety of quality options at wide receiver. Ted Ginn was an under-the-radar signing that could pay dividends once again.
Despite his shaky hands and inability to be consistent, Ginn's best season was with Carolina in 2013. Newton had a strong rapport with him throughout Carolina's tremendous season. Corey "Philly" Brown is an intriguing prospect, due to his breakaway speed and knack for getting open at opportune times. Falcon fans should remember him vividly from seeing him beat Robert McClain deep for a touchdown. Jarrett Boykin and Jerricho Cotchery will provide solid depth as well.
Similar to the Falcons, the Panthers have set themselves up with quality veteran depth and an intriguing rookie at wide receiver. For the first time in his career, Newton has the proper support towards becoming a more consistent passer. As we've seen in the past with scrambling quarterbacks, longevity comes from relying on your arm rather than depending on your feet to move the ball downfield.
Carolina will be a difficult team to unseat in the NFC South. Besides their difficult schedule, only a shaky offensive line and uncertain running game can be classified as major flaws. Ryan Kalil is the only true asset amongst their offensive line. Michael Oher and Mike Remmers will need to step up in order for Mike Shula's offense to become more potent. Newton was hit far too many times last season.
Jonathan Stewart's durability is the other major question. Carolina is confident that his constant injuries (only played 15 out of 32 games between 2012-2013) are behind him. Besides the defense tormenting opposing quarterbacks, Stewart's late-season emergence is what propelled their emphatic four-game winning streak into the playoffs. Mike Tolbert is still reliable, but all eyes will be on how rookie Cameron Artis-Payne develops throughout pre-season.
The concerns about their difficult schedule and fragile offensive line are well documented. Other than that, it baffles me on how Carolina has already been discounted by several analysts and fans. You can't find many well-rounded defenses that feature multiple studs at linebacker and an array of pass rushers with upside. Carolina's defense alone will keep them in games on a weekly basis, regardless if Newton is struggling with his accuracy or the offensive line is getting annihilated.
When looking at the NFC, it's pretty evident on how wide open it has become following Seattle and Green Bay. An excellent defense, capable quarterback, and several reliable players on both sides of the ball will make any team dangerous. Carolina fulfills all of those components through their last two seasons as division champions. Don't be fooled by their lack of ambition in free agency and label them as a declining team. This team is more than capable of retaining first place and possibly pushing Seattle (again) or Green Bay in the divisional round. Great defenses with several key players entering their prime don't fade away.
So, Milo Yiannopoulos got permabanned from Twitter, and, naturally, there is quite the conflict within the twitter community as to the fairness — nay , JUSTNESS, of such a heavy handed move.
Though, right now, I would like to address the boys in my mentions, the frequent earnest to gosh #FreeMilo @ repliers, who keep speaking of this seemingly amorphous term called “free speech” as though it were a term to be applied always and forever, to all speech, at all times, and without exception in their little barely pubescent 4chan and energy-drink fueled lifestyles.
“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” — U.S. Const. am. 1.
While there's several clauses in that beautifully dense piece of literature kicking off the rest of our civil liberties, I want to make clear were solely talking here about the “Free Speech Clause”.
Congress shall make no law […] abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press[.] — U.S. Const. am. 1.
Congress . Shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.
Congress. Like, the government.
Let me get very explicit here: this right allows an individual to express themselves (I say “express” because “speech” has legally been defined to include certain actions as well as spoken and written speech) without interference or constraint by the government . (Even then , though, the Supreme Court has since determined that even the government can limit both the content of speech and the ability to engage in speech as long as the government has a “substantial justification.”)
Ok. Twitter, folks, is *not* a branch of the government. In fact, it's not even in anyway associated with a governmental entity nor does it receive any sort of monetary compensation, in the form of grants or otherwise, from the government — which may in some attenuated manner have rendered it an agent of the government — no, Twitter is a private enterprise. It is an independent corporation, an independent social media forum, and, as such, Twitter is free to set whatever terms they damn-well see fit as guidelines for the user-generated content which they, themselves, host .
One can certainly debate the ethical implications all day, but the legally, Twitter was on solid ground reacting to Milo Yiannopoulos's use of the forum to incite a campaign of targeted harassment toward actress Leslie Jones.
Google on Thursday released Chrome version 24 for Windows, Mac, and Linux. There are no big new features, just speed improvements and a huge slew of security fixes. You can update to the latest release now using the browser's built-in silent updater, or download it directly from google.com/chrome.
The biggest improvement on the user side of things is the speed increase. Google's own Octane JavaScript test shows that this is the fastest Chrome release yet. When the beta came out in November, the company was touting that Chrome had become 26 percent faster on Octane than it was last year. Now it's even faster.
On the developer side, Google has made sure the HTML 5 datalist element now supports suggesting a date and time and has also added support for MathML. Datalist allows you to specify a list of suggested dates and times for input elements while MathML lets you write mathematical content in a consistent way. Other additions include experimental support for CSS Custom Filters.
Aside from the usual bug fixes, speed enhancements, a new version of V8 and Webkit, here is what Google listed as being new in Chrome version 24, according to its changelog notes on the previous beta and dev updates (added in chronological order):
Bookmarks are now searched by their title while typing into the omnibox with matching bookmarks being shown in the autocomplete suggestions pop-down list. Matching is done by prefix. Example: if there is a bookmark with a title of “Doglettes & Catlettes” typing any of the following into the omnibox will likely present the bookmark as a suggestion:: “dog”, “cat”, “cat dog”, “dog cat”, “dogle”, etc. Typing “ogle” or “lettes” will not match.
That's right; there was only one new feature mentioned as this appears to be largely a cleanup and stability release. We did see, however, a huge number of notes on what issues have been addressed. Bugs related to Flash, speech input, YouTube, the omnibox, bookmark sync, installing extensions, memory leaks, JavaScript rendering, scrolling, and ones specific to Windows 8 have all been squashed. The full SVN revision log has more details.
On the security side, Chrome 24 coincidentally addresses 24 security holes (11 rated High, 8 marked Medium, and 5 considered Low):

Public Citizen, July 10, 2013
WASHINGTON, D.C. – The steps a state would need to take to move toward creating a single-payer health care system are somewhat complicated but are doable, according to a new Public Citizen report that provides states with a road map of how to achieve unified, universal health coverage.
A state could not hope to achieve a pure single-payer system, such as exists in Canada, because of federal programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. But many of the ambitions of a single-payer system can be realized at the state level, the report explains. A state can accomplish much that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), or Obamacare, does not: provide universal care, greatly increase administrative efficiency and control costs.
Public Citizen distributed the report to state lawmakers throughout the country through the state affiliates of Health Care NOW. The report is available (at the link below).
“The facts are simple: We pay far more for health care than any developed country, yet we cover fewer people and get worse results,” said Dave Sterrett, health care counsel for Public Citizen's Congress Watch division. “It's time for real change.”
Calling for a universal care system in the United States is often painted as a quixotic pursuit because of incessant fear-mongering by conservatives about the supposed evils of a “government takeover” of health care.
But the report, A Road Map to “Single-Payer”: How States Can Escape the Clutches of the Private Health Insurance System, points out that Americans polled in 2012 were nearly evenly divided when asked if they favored a single-payer system, and this was amid the relentless drumbeat of opposition to the ACA. Evidence suggesting support for the single-payer concept also can be found in Americans' widespread approval of Medicare, the government-run program that provides nearly universal care to those over 65 at far less cost than care that is reimbursed by private insurance companies.
The first step on a state's road to a quasi-single payer system is to obtain a waiver from the ACA. This is well within reach because the act includes language that permits a state to receive a waiver from the ACA's strictures, beginning in 2017. A state can be granted this waiver if it demonstrates that its alternative would provide coverage at least as good, for at least as many people, as the ACA would, and not add costs to the federal budget. For states that receive waivers, the federal government must provide funds to the state that equal what it would spend pursuant to the ACA. A state promising to provide comprehensive, universal care would easily clear this hurdle.
Achieving integration between a state system and Medicare and Medicaid would be more difficult because the law does not permit a broad waiver from these programs. But the law does provide ample room for the administration of these programs within a state to be altered to align billing systems and prices. This would allow Medicare and Medicaid to appear to providers and patients to be almost seamlessly integrated with a state system, although this strategy would require a state to dedicate resources to reconcile claims with the federal government.
The other major legal hurdle for a state to overcome is posed by the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which forbids states from regulating employer benefits plans. But a small body of case law provides grounds for cautious optimism that the hurdles of ERISA can be overcome. A state could insulate its system from being struck down on ERISA grounds by legislating alternative funding options, such as payroll, income or sales taxes.
The final major hurdle is determining how to pay for a universal care system. Transitioning from a system largely financed by employer and employee-paid insurance premiums to one likely financed by some combination of taxes would be challenging.
But the transition should not hurt employers or residents in the long run, the report concludes. A proposed system in Vermont, for instance, would significantly expand both the quality of benefits and the number of people covered. Yet Vermont's plan would cost slightly less than the state's current system, according to analysis commissioned by the state.
“Single-payer in the United States has been scorned but never tested,” said Lisa Gilbert, director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch division. “We're looking for a few pioneering states with the courage and fortitude to let common sense prevail over the insanity of our current patchwork system. Once they succeed, we expect most opposition to single-payer and our reliance on privately insured health care to become historical relics.”

Report – “A Road Map to ‘Single-Payer'” (21 pages): http://www.citizen.org/documents/road-map-to-single-payer-health-care-report.pdf
Comment:
By Don McCanne, M.D.
This very useful Public Citizen report on steps toward single payer at the state level serves two important functions:
1) Although the Affordable Care Act is providing a few beneficial tweaks to the financing of our health care system, by now it is obvious that, by building on our dysfunctional, fragmented system, intolerable health care injustices will be perpetuated. Yet Congress itself is currently so dysfunctional that it is impossible to get them to consider a vastly superior alternative – a single payer Improved Medicare for All.
For those who cannot wait until we are able to elect a sane supermajority in Congress, this report provides suggestions on how some single payer principles could be applied at the state level. Although that pathway is rugged and cannot lead all the way to single payer, at least it would provide more improvement than we are seeing with the Affordable Care Act. There is plenty in this report to keep health justice activists very busy on the state level.
2) The far more important conclusion to be drawn from this report is that states acting alone cannot establish a bona fide single payer system. There are too many major barriers that would prevent states from totally replacing their fragmented financing infrastructure. Under current federal laws, limitations imposed on states would not allow them to capture many of the more effective benefits of the single payer model.
Although states could come much closer to universal coverage, their systems would still perpetuate many of the inefficiencies and inequities that exist today. Without the power of a public, single payer monopsony (a single buyer), improving allocation of our resources would be much more difficult. Although states could improve billing functions, that captures only a very small portion of the profound administrative waste in our system. Any savings on a state level would be very modest and would not be enough to pay for the elimination of uninsurance and underinsurance. Total health care costs would increase even more, when costs are already intolerable.
The lesson? We cannot let up in the least in our efforts to educate the nation on the imperative of a single payer national health program. To be unequivocally clear, that's NATIONAL.
We cannot use the example of Saskatchewan and pretend that a state can set up a single payer system that could serve as an example for the nation – a model that could be expanded to all states. No. Saskatchewan began with a tabula rasa. They were able to create a de novo single payer system. The Public Citizen report shows us that our existing federal laws create complexities that would prevent states from enacting a financing model that could be held up to the rest of the
nation as an example of the benefits of single payer, even though that is a noble intent of the report. In fact, there is a risk that such an effort would allow opponents to claim, “See, single payer doesn't work.”
Vermont is currently implementing legislation that originally was intended to bring it a single payer financing system. But they found that a bona fide single payer system is not possible, so they have abandoned the term, “single payer.” That might be wise advice for other state activists.
We cannot allow enthusiasm for state efforts to diminish in the least the exhaustive effort that will be required to reach the threshold of political feasibility that will be a requisite to motivate Congress to take action.
The graduation rate at Southern University at New Orleans has inched up by 3 percentage points -- from 5 percent to 8 percent -- but it still is the lowest for any public historically black college in the country and the second-lowest of any urban public college, new federal figures show.
The only public university in a city that has a lower rate is Oklahoma State University in Oklahoma City, which graduated 5 percent of its students in 2009. That's the latest year for which such information is available.
The new numbers were issued while a study is being conducted in Louisiana on Gov. Bobby Jindal's controversial proposal to merge SUNO with the University of New Orleans, a predominantly white school about a mile away on the south shore of Lake Pontchartrain.
UNO, the city's only other public four-year institution of higher learning, has a graduation rate of 21 percent, down a percentage point from 2008. UNO spokesman Adam Norris declined to comment on the data.
Even with SUNO's slight increase, the university is still the only four-year school in Louisiana with a graduation rate in single digits; the next lowest is LSU at Alexandria, where the figure is 12 percent.
"It's not a good thing to be that low. I don't think there's anybody in the world of academe who would be happy with that low rate," said Belle Wheelan, president of the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, the organization that determines which colleges and universities in 11 states merit accreditation.
Nevertheless, Southern University System President Ronald Mason Jr. put a positive spin on the rise: "It's all part of the real story of SUNO, which is that, despite tremendous odds, it continues to move in a positive direction."
SUNO is trumpeting its spring enrollment of 3,318, which represents about 91 percent of the school's pre-Hurricane Katrina student population of 3,647.
"This signifies that students remain confident that we are a great fit for them," SUNO Chancellor Victor Ukpolo said in a prepared statement.
The graduation rate represents the number of first-time, full-time freshmen who earn degrees within six years at the institution where they start. SUNO administrators, as well as their counterparts at other schools, have complained the methodology leaves out many of their students, who often take longer to graduate.
SUNO's low number is "a picture that no one is satisfied with," Mason said.
However, he believes that there are various mitigating factors that underlie SUNO's low graduation rate, including the need for many students to take necessary remedial courses, juggle classwork with holding a job and rearing a family, and cope with the tremendous disruptions that Hurricane Katrina wrought.
"The average time for a SUNO student (to graduate) is eight or nine years," Mason said. "What's important is that they get the degree, and some of them have life circumstances that won't let them get a degree in six years."
Many students at UNO face the same obstacles.
Low graduation rates show "why we have been pushing, and continue to push, the higher-education system so hard to raise the state's graduation rates," said Melissa Sellers, Jindal's spokeswoman. "Every student that drops out is more likely to end up in debt and without the skills they need to succeed in today's economy."
Other urban universities with low graduation rates include the University of the District of Columbia, where the figure is 12 percent; the University of Houston -- Downtown, 16 percent; and Metropolitan State University in St. Paul, Minn., 14 percent.
Louisiana schools at the other end of the graduation-rate spectrum include Tulane University, with a 73 percent rate; Centenary College, 62 percent; and Loyola University and LSU's Baton Rouge campus, 59 percent each.
While Tulane's graduation rate is the highest in Louisiana, it ranked third from the bottom among the country's "most competitive" colleges, according to a 2009 study compiled by the American Enterprise Institute. That study was based on 2007 graduation rates.
The Education Department report shows a national graduation rate of slightly more than 57 percent. The overall rate for private, nonprofit schools is 65 percent, compared with nearly 56 percent for public schools.

SAN FRANCISCO – USF Director of Athletics Scott Sidwell has been appointed as the chair of the NCAA baseball selection committee for the upcoming season. He succeeds South Alabama Athletic Director Dr. Joel Erdmann as the head of the national committee responsible for selecting the 64 teams who will participate in the NCAA Baseball Tournament in June.
“Certainly it's a real honor to be selected as the chair of the NCAA baseball selection committee,” Sidwell said. “The College World Series is one of the great sporting events sponsored by the NCAA, and I'm honored to be one of many people who help put that on.
“Having been a college baseball player, a coach and now an administrator, and having been to the College World Series as an administrator, along with multiple regionals, it's very near and dear to my heart.”
As committee chairman, Sidwell will be charged with facilitating the months-long process of selecting the 64 team field for the NCAA Tournament, coordinating communication and review efforts among the eight regions represented, as well as overseeing the entire slate of operations leading up to and during the College World Series in Omaha. Sidwell's role will also extend to representing the committee at social and media functions surrounding the championship.
Sidwell's baseball experience runs deep. A former utility player at Brown and Tulane, Sidwell participated in the 1994 NCAA Regional with the Green Wave before serving as an assistant coach during Tulane's 1996 Regional appearance. Sidwell later served as an associate athletic director at Tulane during a stretch of nine consecutive NCAA Regionals appearances that included College World Series appearances in 2001 and 2005.
He has spent the last two years as the chair of the West regional advisory committee where he helped coordinate the entire selection process involving West Coast Conference, Big West, Pac 12, Mountain West and WAC institutions.
The Bitcoin debate of the year has been about how the blockchain block size matters. Whether to increase block size, how to do it, and when to do it, everyone seems to have an opinion. Now, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who has been mostly silent on the issue, has weighed in with a personal desire for growth, seemingly aligning with other Bitcoin corporate leadership.
To BIP or not to BIP, that is the question
BIP 100, crafted by noted developer Jeff Garzikc is the current favorite amongst miners and the voting majority when it comes to block size upgrades. With BIP100 the power to set the block size limit is transferred from the Bitcoin development community to mining pools, up to a roof of 32MB. BIP101 would have the block size grow to 8MB starting this December, and is widely supported by the Bitcoin corporate ownership. Proposed by Core developers Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen, BIP101 has not gained much traction amongst voters, partially because this proposal was also tied to a fork called Bitcoin XT.
BIP101 had a manifesto that was signed as a vote of confidence by many of the leading businessmen in the Bitcoin community. The Chief Executive Officers include Stephen Pair of BitPay, Peter Smith of Blockchain.info, Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville of Circle, Sam Cole of KNCMiner, John McDonnell of Bitnet.io, Charles Cascarilla of itBit, Wences Casares of Xapo, and Mike Belshe of BitGo.
Brian Armstrong was a glaring omission, but he seems to have aligned with BIP101 on his Twitter account Monday, linking to the document in a Tweet.
We need a solution in place sooner rather than later. Proposals I've seen are reasonable, low enough risk, now we just need code. — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) October 13, 2015
The corporate leaders do not seem to have galvanized any support for BIP101, and the 8MB block size itself has only seen a tepid interest. Maybe Armstrong sees a great influx in Bitcoin use for the holiday season, but the 8MB increase may be too much to ask for at this time.
If you've been frustrated looking for the best deals in your city, a new website is here to help.
is the project of UNC Asheville graduate Ailis Grosh, created after she became frustrated looking through multiple sites for deals and coming up short.
Her new site, and soon to be app, features a map which shows icons where deals can be found on any specific day of the week.
"You know, most of the time you'd find a site that listed specials if you were lucky and it was up to date," Grosh said. "But then, you'd have to go look up the business on Google Maps to see if it was nearby. And, if it's not, you'd have to start the process all over again. So, I actually started it for a school project my last semester of college at UNC Asheville, and people were really interested in it, so I decided to keep working on it."
Filters can be applied to select a day or a number of days with options for food, drinks and entertainment.
You can also check a box to see which locations allow dogs and which are family friendly.
Hover over that location and the box that pops up will display the deal along with Google and Yelp! ratings for that business.
The site only works in Asheville, but Grosh has plans to expand.
I am currently developing online courses and learning material for programming beginners. In my research, I came across the following interesting chart:
Data Source: www.google.com/trends
As you can see (according to Google Trends) in November 2015, for the first time ever, more people were searching for "learn python" than for "learn java". Looking at the last 5 years, the demand to "learn python" was constantly rising.
So what does this mean for the future of those 2 languages? More and more people are learning Python – that's for sure. Python has already become the number 1 programming course for beginners in many universities years ago [1]. The main reason for this is simple: Python is simple. I think it has the simplest and most intuitive syntax from all programming languages. It can be read just like pseudo-code. To illustrate this, let's compare those two code snippets …
Python: an Array, Some Basic IO and a Loop:
words = [ "This", "is", "a", "Test" ] for word in words: print word
Even a non programmer can read this and will understand what the program does.
Java: Array, Basic IO and a Loop (+Compile & Run):
public class SimpleTest { public static void main(String[] args) { private String[] words = { "This", "is", "a", "Test" }; for (String word: words) { System.out.println(word); } } }
OK, for a Java developer this still looks simple. But for a programming beginner - it is a big difference. But is this a “real world example”? Enterprise applications are far more complex, right? Yes, that's right. Java is very popular for developing complex enterprise applications – and I don't want to say that there is anything wrong with that. Java is a great, mature language, it has powerful frameworks and there are a lot of good JEE developers out there. Until now, I have only seen a few enterprises that are using Python to build their applications – and I don't think that this will dramatically change in the next years. Anyway I want to say that one can definitely build scalable enterprise applications with Python (and many startups do). A lot of famous applications are actually built on Python - even largest scale apps like www.reddit.com[2] or www.youtube.com[3]. I have often heard people say: “Python is not enterprise ready and does not scale” or “Python is just another scripting language” - maybe these people have never really worked with Python ...
Anyway, let's take a look at the following chart:
Data Source: www.google.com/trends
You can see, that the search volume of “python developer” compared to “java developer” is pretty low. That probably means: companies still search for Java (EE) developers – as they do it since years. But take a look at the yellow line. There is a strong growing demand for data scientists.
Big Data and Machine Learning tools like Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, Mahout, HDFS, NoSQL Databases, Tensorflow and others have started to change our world a couple of years ago. And in the Big Data world – Python is very popular for data analysis. So if you want to jump on that train, you might as well be interested in learning Python.
Another big movement, that is changing the IT world, is DevOps or “automating your sysadmins as much as you can”. Many great new tools like Ansible (a configuration management and deployment automation tool) or OpenStack (an on premise cloud/IaaS solution) are written in Python. And many sysadmins, penetration testers and office workers use Python to automate their repeating tasks.
Conclusion
Python is getting more and more popular. If you are a programming beginner, a sysadmin or into DevOps or Big Data – it might be a good idea to take a closer look at it. If you want to learn Python and don't know where to start – you might want to read this article: http://slash4.net/blog/python/what-is-the-best-way-to-learn-python-in-2016.html
George Hilsdon was a man of many firsts for Chelsea FC. He became the first Blue to score 100 goals for the club, the first to score six goals in an FA Cup match, and in February of 1907 in a match against Ireland he became the first Chelsea player to represent England. Hilsdon began his career with West Ham United in 1903 but transferred to Chelsea in 1906 to become one of the most prolific scorers in club history. He announced his goalscoring intentions early on by scoring five goals in his debut for the team and went on to earn the nickname Gatling Gun because his shots on goal “were simply unstoppable and which travel like shots from a gun.”
George Hilsdon, Chelsea's first goals centurion. (Thank you, West Ham.) pic.twitter.com/Hre3MxI6fr — Rick Glanvill (@RickGlanvill) November 21, 2013
Hilsdon went on to score 108 goals in 164 appearances and is still the 9th highest goalscorer of all-time for Chelsea. His six goals in one FA Cup match are still a club record which has stood for over 100 years. His prowess in front of goal was not just limited to the club level as he went on to score 14 goals in just eight international appearances for the Three Lions.
The England man returned to West Ham in 1912 after battling injuries and alcoholism at the tail end of his Chelsea career. Despite these setbacks he still scored a goal nearly every two games for the East London club. His football career came to an end after suffering serious injuries on the frontlines in World War I.
Hilsdon does not have a statue at Stamford Bridge but there is a weather vane modeled after his appearance and it is said that it will bring terrible luck and misfortune if removed from the ground. If anything, George Hilsdon was a colorful character who struggled with many personal issues but still remains one of the best and most prolific goalscorers in Chelsea history.

1) The Poverty of Marx's Math: Or, Marx Thinks Wages Suck.
It's confusingly true. Workers under capitalism are shortchanged. And one of the central but hardest to appreciate lessons about our current economic order is that “profit is theft” (a Godelier and Proudhon mash-up). But theft of what? How we answer this question determines whether we will imagine a future still tormented by inflation and imprisoned in class struggle or we will work towards a revolutionary transformation of life and our historical conditions of survival. Is profit's theft merely of labor (as extra wages) or of our entire history?
Certainly, “Marx's math“, described by Brian McKenna recently, is crucial to grasping the “profit is theft” lesson. I often begin teaching Marx with his math as well, through a story quite similar to the one relayed by McKenna. Mine recounts a story my teacher would tell his students about his job in a pizza shop. My teacher described how he would try to stop working after he had made enough pizzas to cover his own wages for the day. Of course, he was never allowed to stop. This story warrants the same kind of math conveyed by McKenna's McDonald's example, though without the sophisticated data on overhead, etc. The benefit of this approach is that we can imagine not just wanting more from our life and our work but deserving more. And, as McKenna describes, it creates a concrete connection between students' own crappy jobs and theories of “exploitation.” It also demonstrates how central exploitation is to the overall system of capitalist production. But, in spite of this, I would say that Marx's math by itself potentially misses the entire lesson to which Marx's Capital, a critique of economic theory, is dedicated. Specifically, I would say that it can seriously restrict how we understand what “more” we could want out of life, our work, and what we all make together.
The argument McKenna tells in such an engaging way gets at the first part but not the complete spirit of Marx's critique. In fact, Marx is critiquing the existing labor theories of value of his day, since they depicted as eternal what he saw as historical: the form of value in capitalist society, the wage-labor relationship. The problem we have with this first part is that McKenna's lesson on Marx's math interprets a critique of wage-labor through wage-labor itself. Surplus value here, in his (McK) explanation, becomes merely “unpaid wages.”
What we might miss is the crucial understanding of how the wage-labor relation is the lynchpin of a society imprisoned by its own products. The simple math misses this and, therefore, the full meaning of “wage-slavery” and Marx's critique. To avoid this problem, what I would like to suggest here, in an addendum to McKenna, is that Marx's math is only fundamental if it leads to an understanding of how money as the dominant medium of exchange imprisons society, therefore corrupting every possible social relationship and set of priorities with its own force and “demands.” This next step signals the difference between Marx's radical lesson and the liberal failures of the New Deal. The math alone only gets us temporary redistribution within wage-slavery, a point which Marx himself makes quite plainly (link). Inflation and unemployment always catch up to the increase in wages. What I will discuss more below is that this step beyond Marx's math is the difference between a lesson about inequality (inadequate wages) and a lesson about poverty (wage-slavery). Marx was not a liberal who thought poverty was a problem of low wages. Poverty, I will suggest, should be the center of our reading of Marx's critique and should have nothing whatsoever to do with wages except in critiquing the wage-labor relationship altogether.
2) We Deserve More… But, More What? And, What We?
Left as it is, the focus on Marx's math alone leaves us forgetting that Marx was critiquing economic theory, not trying to prove it. He was trying to show how it failed under its own conditions and logic. But beyond this, many see his project as critiquing wage-labor as a way of thinking, which prevents us from imagining social life beyond the limits of wages.
One of the characteristic shortcomings of the surplus-value-as-wage analogy is its interpretation as proving a productive class off of which all others sponge. Thus, it is easy to misinterpret the capital-vampire figure, which are the machines of a factory in Marx's vampire quote (link) as a “bloodsucking” class/person/group/race/etc. This is clear in the typical problem of imagining so-called domestic work (or, “social reproduction”) as unproductive. Indeed, we could try to fit this into a logic of the wage: daycare costs $X, therefore that labor is worth $X in unpaid value. But, do we really want to walk down that path? Do we want to conform our care of each other and ourselves to wage relationships? Let's push this even further.
An additional shortcoming to the surplus-value-as-wage approach is that it leaves out all of the Malthusian problems of surplus populations that Marx fought so vehemently. If we imagine that our wages are not what they should be, it has nothing to say about the numbers of people who are currently unemployed and seemingly contribute “nothing” to the economy. Marx, throughout his body of work, spends a great deal of effort discussing how capitalist production requires those population surpluses (link). Do we really want to suggest that their ranks are not deserving of “more” because they are not producing what economic theory determines can be measured and explained in wages? Instead, we must remember that, if pushed to the next step, there is something crucially liberatory about what this math can illustrate: the ability to increase society's total material wealth and simultaneously reduce its total magnitude of value (see Chpt1, Sect2. http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm). We can make more for less effort.
Indeed, machines decrease the amount of labor time necessary to produce things we “want” (“whether…[these wants] spring from the stomach or from fancy, makes no difference” -link). Machines reduce the magnitude of value in the stuff we make. But, how do we work this into the surplus-value-as-wage approach? As the value produced per worker falls, does that mean we also deserve less? NO. Marx's crucial lesson for students, scholars, and activists comes much later in Capital, in discussing the “General Law of Capitalist Accumulation”: Machines make more for less labor but also put people out of work; thus, we suffer and work longer as wealth becomes easier to produce. Marx sums up this paradox nicely in his notebooks for Capital:
“The measure of wealth is then not any longer, in any way, labour time, but rather disposable time. Labour time as the measure of value posits wealth itself as founded on poverty, and disposable time as existing in and because of the antithesis to surplus labour time; or, the positing of an individual's entire time as labour time, and his degradation therefore to mere worker, subsumption under labour. The most developed machinery thus forces the worker to work longer than the savage [sic] does, or than he himself did with the simplest, crudest tools.”
It is from this insight—the paradoxical increased impoverishment of society simultaneously with the ability to produce more for less—that Marx's revolutionary critique emerges. Here we see that a view of poverty focusing on being shortchanged wages does not really get at why wages suck. Poverty we might say is, from Marx's perspective, society's inability to take full advantage of its cooperation and productive capacity because of the necessity to produce profit and expand capital as private property. If we “deserve more,” in this case, the “we” is everyone and the “more what” is time free from the tyranny of work, wage-labor, and the boss's authority. For Marx, we deserve more economic freedom and as such freedom from having to conform our lives to economic necessity. We deserve more time, without having to ask for more money. This lesson is, in some ways, contrary to surplus-value-as-unpaid-wages. Students here will say, “are you suggesting that people shouldn't have to work?!? … That's IMPOSSIBLE!” And, the subsequent discussion—”why is that impossible? And, what would it take to become possible?”—is what finally approaches Marx's critique of capitalism and economic theories of it.
3) Why Vampires Suck.
It is for this reason that we should never end the lesson with Marx's math alone. In my class, I next ask why couldn't my teacher stop working? “Because his boss wouldn't let him,” the students say. I reply, “Really? How? …With a gun? Or threat to his family? Blackmail?” The answer is, of course, “no, with starvation.” He will starve, not because there is not enough food or the capacity to produce food but because the pressure to make a profit off of food makes his starvation necessary, if he will not work. In this sense, McKenna's discussion of democracy must go farther as well. Where is the democratic practice of deciding how to utilize the world's cooperation and productive capacity? Here again, the issue is not how many more dollars should workers be getting but instead how should we free ourselves from the condition of having to beg for our conditions of survival in the form of wages. Marx calls this “pauperism.” Under capitalism, we are all beggars so long as we see our world through wage-labor. This is something closer to an understanding of capitalist poverty from a Marxian perspective, which is by principle often rather circular.
But, to understand even more fully the import of Marx's math to his overall argument and to the concept of poverty, we have to understand what the “vampires” are and why they suck. The vampires, as I mentioned, are machines (dead and congealed past labor). They are the pizza ovens and the dough-kneading machines of my teacher's pizzeria job. Once purchased by a private owner, they not only demand that their costs be justified but they also demand low-paid workers to run them. They suck because the capital fixed in them must grow. It grows by sucking living capacity from workers for the sake of growth itself. But, further, they suck because someone who had money needed that money to grow. They invested it in a fund of some kind, which lent it to a pizza shop for equipment, and now expects interest. It is these pressures that make the dead live and suck like unholy terrors on our living capacities. Here, we might ask students to think about retirement funds and how money as investment, by demanding interest, transforms our living world into an impoverished world, dominated by and sucked by the dead. This is capital. This is the fetishism of commodities. This is a world of poverty where capitalists, machines, and workers alike are all tormented by money demanding to grow and suck in the process! And, questioning this in order to become free of the tyranny of capital, is the revolutionary lesson that Marx's math alone does not tell us.

After the UK cabinet's recent foray to Aberdeen, Alex Salmond will enter the belly of the Westminster beast today. The Scottish First Minister will deliver the New Statesman lecture (sold out) on "Scotland's Future in Scotland's Hands" at 6:30pm. In the address, which is trailed in today's papers, he will urge the English centre-left to embrace Scottish independence as a "progressive" cause. As he said when the lecture was announced, he believes an independent Scotland would act as "a progressive beacon and a powerful economic counterweight to the pull of London", helping to "rebalance the social and economic structure across these islands which has seen the UK become one of the most unequal societies in the developed world". In a reversal of the assumption that Scottish independence would consign the rest of the UK to permanent Conservative government, Salmond's pitch is that a more "progressive" Scotland will help to create a more progressive Britain.
The First Minister is right to downplay the fear that the loss of Scotland would lead to unending Tory rule at Westminster. On no occasion since 1945 would independence have changed the identity of the winning party and on only two occasions would it have converted a Labour majority into a hung parliament (1964 and October 1974). Without Scotland, Labour would still have won in 1945 (with a majority of 146, down from 143), in 1966 (77, down from 98), in 1997 (139, down from 179), in 2001 (129, down from 167) and in 2005 (43, down from 66). What those who say that Labour cannot win without Scotland are really arguing is that the party will never win a sizeable majority again. History shows that England and Wales are prepared to elect a Labour government when the conditions are right (although the loss of Labour's 41 Scottish seats, compared to the Tories' one, would certainly make the task harder).
Salmond's wider contention is that his pursuit of progressive policies (such as investment in early years education, higher social security spending, and nuclear disarmament) in an independent Scotland would encourage their adoption in the rest of the UK. But its appeal is diluted by one central fact: there is a better-than-average chance that the next UK general election will result in the formation of a radical Labour government. As leader of the party, Ed Miliband (who will address the Scottish Labour conference on Friday 21 March) has adopted precisely the kind of centre-left policies championed by Salmond. He has pledged to scrap the bedroom tax (which, like the Poll Tax, has become a symbol of Conservative callousness in Scotland), to reverse the privatisation of the NHS, to invest more in early-years education and childcare, to reintroduce the 50p tax rate, to spread the use of the living wage, to rebalance the economy and to increase infrastructure spending. He has condemned the invasion of Iraq (which so alienated progressives in Scotland and elsewhere), prevented a rush to war in Syria and pledged to pursue a foreign policy based on "values, not alliances". Finally, he has denounced the rise in income inequality (which, as Salmond rightly laments, has made the UK one of "the most unequal societies in the developed world"), and has made its reversal his defining mission. If the UK elects a Labour government next May, it won't need Scotland to serve as a "progressive beacon". Rather, it will become a more progressive country through its own means.
In other respects, Salmond's claim that Scotland would help pull the rest of UK to the left is risible. While Labour has pledged to increase corporation tax from 20 per cent to 21 per cent in order to fund a reduction in business rates for small firms, the SNP has vowed to reduce it to 3 per cent below the British level. Rather than a progressive race to top, Salmond would fire the starting gun on a race to bottom. The unflattering comparisons do not end here for the First Minister. As James Maxwell, an SNP supporter, has written on The Staggers, "When Miliband challenged Rupert Murdoch's reactionary influence over British media and political life, Salmond remained strangely loyal to the News Corporation chairman. When Miliband attacked corporate tax avoidance, Salmond handed Amazon £10m worth of Scottish government money and encouraged the company to establish distribution centres in Scotland. Where Miliband has pledged to rein in monopolistic energy companies, Salmond opposed George Osborne's windfall tax on North Sea oil profits. Since becoming leader, Miliband has displayed a willingness to confront 'vested interests' generally lacking in the Scottish First Minister."
One of the few factors that could aid Salmond's flagging cause (the latest poll puts support for independence at just 32 per cent with 57 per cent opposed) is a Tory recovery. With just one Conservative MP in, the fear of another five years under the Tory yoke, and a government wedded to permanent austerity, could help to push many towards separation. By the same measure, then, Labour's consistent poll lead (which stands at nine points today), and Miliband's progressive promise, is one of the forces helping to drive them away.

If I kept a journal — one of those five-year books, maybe, which allow you to look back at the same day in previous years (a service Facebook now provides, without the pesky introspection) — the entries might look something like this:
Today I resolved to do better. Today, or rather tonight, after an afternoon of shouted demands to help me put away the groceries and help me empty the dishwasher and finally, a sulking retreat to my bedroom and a refusal to make dinner for people who were so inconvenienced by such things as foodstuffs and dishes, I resolved not to do that again. I will not ruin another evening by wallowing in self-pity, I will not again turn a little whining into “complete disrespect and not caring about other people at all.” I will not wind one instance, or even many, of failing to clear the table into an entire future cloth of filth and negligence and entitlement.
Today I resolved to do that again. To have more dance parties in the living room like that one, to decorate a thrilled child in tinsel as often as she likes, to say yes to ice cream, to let little things slide, to notice that the older child speaking scornfully to the younger is also helping her, and that the younger child, far from being as offended as I am on her behalf, is appreciating the unexpected attention and the rough kindness. I resolved to sit with as many children at bedtime as would have me, and to never, ever skip the loving good night.
I wrote neither of those things today, or on any day. I wrote them, in the borrowed style of Heidi Julavits's “The Folded Clock,” (one of the best books I read in 2015), somewhat after their respective “todays.” But I wrote them in my head as they happened, something I do nearly every day. “Are parent resolutions a ‘thing?'” a friend asked me recently. They are for me, although they are not really a New Year's thing. They are a constant thing. My resolutions are always on auto play somewhere in the recesses of my mind. More like that. Less like that. I can't believe I did that. Why can't it always be like that?
I could consider that a bad thing, a nattering that keeps me from being fully present in any moment. I don't. It's a part of me, a person who thinks in words and is always, in some way, writing, even if a pen or a keyboard is nowhere in sight. At times it's even overlaid with other voices, as I imagine the stories forming in my children's minds: my mother read to us nearly every night; my mother was there for me when I wanted her; my mother always liked my brother/sister best; my mother yelled at me all the time, I could never please her.
I wonder what I am saying that will iron itself into their brains and become a part of them. I resolve to make it something good, something powerful. My mother always thought I could do anything I set my mind to. My mother believed in me. And then I worry that it will not be, as on a daily basis I don't even believe any of them will wipe the kitchen counter.
Do I make specific resolutions as a parent at the end of every year? Yes, but in large part they're the same resolutions I make every year. In January 2012, in this space, I vowed to “clean it, own it and enjoy it.” I'd organize our home to make living there easier, I resolved (clean it); I'd make affirmative choices about how we spend our time, knowing that a “yes” to even a fun thing is a “no” to hanging out together at home (own it) and I'd appreciate all the journeys rather than straining toward the destination (enjoy it). In 2013, I graded myself and renewed the same resolutions. In 2014, I focused on “enjoy it,” writing in Resolved: The Best Moment of 2014? This One:
A few days ago, a Facebook friend shared a conversation she'd had with one of her children, in which she asked for “the best moment of 2013.” Her child, at a moment that rather distinctly didn't stand out in any particular way, enthusiastically declared “this one!”
I still love that — “this one!” Because, as I wrote then, when things are going badly it really is the ordinary moments we miss. This moment, right now, 15 minutes from leaving to pick up a child at hockey, with another downstairs re-reading Harry Potter in the newly illustrated edition he got for Christmas, a third playing Playmobil horses with a friend all over the floor in a way that I know she won't want to ever clean up and the last child making Rice Krispie Treats to mail her grandfather — this moment is the best.
But it's really less the larger resolutions that count than the little daily ones, just as it's not the grand speeches and lectures that my children will remember as adults but rather, the way we are together, every hour, every day. My inner monologue of daily resolution is less an evaluation than a narrative. It's the story of my life as a parent as it spins out behind me, and an emotional playlist for how I'd like to meet the challenges ahead.
So my resolution for 2016, along with my beloved fresh start home organization plans and a new calendar filled with professional goals, is simply more following the smaller resolutions. I hope for gentle course corrections, not grand change. Things are good here for now. And, as always, I resolve anew to enjoy that.
What will you resolve, big and small, for 2016?

SACRAMENTO (CBS/AP) — California senators too drunk to drive can turn to a 24-hour ride service funded by taxpayers, a local newspaper reports.
State records show that the California Senate hired in February two part-time employees whose duties include “ground transportation for Senate members.” The employees are paid $2,532 per month, the Sacramento Bee reported.
The service comes after high-profile arrests of lawmakers on suspicion of drunken driving. Four lawmakers in the last five years have been accused of drunk driving, including three on streets around the Capitol.
The office of Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León declined to discuss the details or rationale of the program.
“We're not going to provide comment, because it's a security issue,” spokesman Anthony Reyes said.
The California Assembly also offers transportation services late at night, but not overnight.
One man who turned down the job told the newspaper that Senate officials approached him about working overnight to drive senators home upon request. One legislative chief of staff confirmed that the service is intended to prevent drunk driving by legislators.
Members have been given small plastic cards with the number for “Sacramento 24 hr transportation.” The cards feature a “California State Senate” banner across the top as well as a phone number for the chamber's chief sergeant-at-arms, to be used in an emergency.
Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, said the rides are reflective of the Legislature's sense of entitlement.
“They get all these perks,” he said. “Perhaps at the end of session, when things run late, there could be some temporary allocation made so legislators can get to the airport. But on an ongoing basis, this makes no sense.”

Two days after coaching his team to a Final Four berth, Frank Martin said he's learned which people really understand what he does. The most important people to him in the coaching world haven't called because they understand what he's going through.
“In moments like this you know who the people that really understand are because they don't call, they don't text. They leave you alone, because they get it,” Martin said.
Before getting on a plane bound for Phoenix to compete for a national title and all the distractions that come with it, Martin said he had spoken with two people, Bob Huggins and Billy Donovan. He spoke to both Final Four experienced coaches on Monday about how to handle the biggest stage of college basketball.
One would think Martin called Huggins, his mentor, because his West Virginia team, which plays a similar style of defense as South Carolina, played Gonzaga in the Sweet 16. The Zags are the Gamecocks' opponent on Saturday in the Final Four.
“I called him last night. He said, ‘I figured you'd eventually call.' We were on the phone for an hour. We spoke about everything,” Martin said on Tuesday. “We briefly spoke about Gonzaga. Huggs and Mark Few (Gonzaga's head coach) are good friends too, so I'm not going to put a friend of mine in the middle of that.”
The main reason for the phone call to Huggins and Donovan, a two-time national champion coach at Florida, was to seek advice. The advice helped.
“I speak about being on this ride before and the Sweet 16 and all that. This week is a brand-new week for me. I'm sure I'm going to mess up some stuff here this week,” Martin said. “I spoke with Billy Donovan and Huggs yesterday so they can kind of give me perspective as to how to best manage this week so I can prevent distractions for our staff, players, because there are a lot of windows for a lot of distractions.”
Martin said the purpose for this trip isn't for press conferences or celebrating how they got there; it's two one-game seasons, as the team refers them to, to win a national championship.
The discussions with both coaches helped him clear his mind and provide clarity to the situation he, his staff, and his team will face when stepping off that plane on Wednesday.
“I'm sure I'm going to mess up some stuff here this week. I feel pretty good about the Xs and Os, but there are some other things that I'm going to mess up,” Martin said. “It cleared my of a lot of things. I'm still going to mess up stuff because I'm a stubborn S.O.B and I'm eventually going to do stuff my way, but that gave me clarity, allowed me to think so I can put my own flavor in how we want to manage this week. That's what we spoke about.”
Everything will be new to Martin and the Gamecocks, but he knows he has dear friends like Huggins, Donovan, Billy Kennedy, Anthony Grant, etc. to help him battle the distractions.

A comment that was left on my last post has got me thinking. ako says:
“Sadly, I suspect most of the people who need to hear this think “If you were capable of taking care of yourself, you wouldn't be fat!” is an effective refutation.”
And ako is right that the majority of the anti-fat brigade will think that. The more I do this fat activism stuff, the more I realise that fat haters and those who are set in the “But fat is unhealthy!” are not going to be persuaded by anything I say. Because I am a fat person, and to them, fat is bad. Plus I'm really, really tired of having to “prove” everything about myself to these people. To be honest, I don't care what they think.
But there is something I want to clarify in response to ako's comment.
I don't believe they are the people who need to hear what I have to say. What many of us have to say in the fatosphere.
I believe the people who need to hear these things are you my dear readers. But not just you, me as well. I realised on thinking abou this for awhile, is that I want to talk to all of you out there, who feel like I felt (and still do feel sometimes). I want to reach those of you who struggle with your self esteem. I want to reach those of you who have bodies that the mainstream doesn't approve of. I want to reach those of you who feel like you are worthless because you are fat. I want to reach those of you who have loved ones who are fat that you genuinely want to support without judgement based on their bodies.
I want to reach those of you who have felt desperate, worthless, alone, scared, worried, vulnerable, bullied, ashamed, depressed, frustrated, angry, hurt and suicidal because your bodies don't meet some arbitrary standard of “normal”.
You matter to me.
I have felt all of those things at some point in my life because my body doesn't meet that arbitrary standard, and I want you to know someone understands. Someone else has felt what you are feeling. Someone cares that you are feeling these things and wants to help you feel better about yourself. Someone wants to help you find your voice.
That someone is me.
Because it wasn't that long ago I was lost in a world that hates fat people and I found the fatosphere, and it saved my life. A few years ago, the fatosphere* gave me an alternative perspective to consider. They gave me the tools to understand what was happening around me. They gave me evidence, language and information that I could use to think about how I felt and what I needed to do to bring myself out of that dark place of self loathing and worthlessness. But most importantly, they helped me find my voice. They helped me realise that I actually have a voice and helped me find ways to use it. I cannot tell you how empowering that is.
Finding that voice is what has improved my life far beyond anything else. It is what guided me to find the confidence and self esteem I have today. And I believe that with confidence and self esteem, one can face everything that life throws at them with a whole lot more resilience than without. That doesn't mean everything becomes wine and roses, it just means that you're able to stand up for yourself, you're able to let go of other people's negativity and problems and focus on your own needs and growth.
I want all of you to have it too.
I believe the real beauty of a strong self esteem – the more you have, the more you want to give to others. But even better still, the stronger someone's self esteem is, and I mean real self esteem, not self importance, the less judgmental they are about the arbitrary things in world around them. The stronger the self esteem, the less likely one is to judge others for their bodies, appearance, gender, race, faith, age, sexuality, physical ability, health and so on. All those things cease to be so important when you feel strong and confident in yourself. What becomes important are things like respect, equality, humour, intelligence, fun, balance and creativity.
I'm here doing this for you. You deserve it.
*And to share the tools that helped me, I'm building on my blog-roll over there on the right. I'll be adding more than time progresses, so keep your eye on it!

Russian ultra-nationalist Igor Strelkov has said President Vladimir Putin could be toppled "like the last tsar" if he does not fully support pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine.
According to the Sunday Times, the former commander of the pro-Russia rebels in the disputed region speculated about Putin's removal from power when he addressed supporters last week.
Although Putin is seen as a hardliner in the West, Strelkov believes the Russian premier is too liberal, and has failed to act decisively enough in the region due to his decision not to annex Donetsk and Luhansk.
"Ukraine was, is and remains a part of Russia," he said according to the newspaper. He warned that Putin could "end up like [former Serbian leader Slobodan] Milošević who was toppled by both patriots and liberals over his policy of being neither with one group nor the other."
This sentiment was also expressed in a controversial interview with German paper Der Speigel published 18 March, in which Strelkov spoke of his longing for the re-emergence of a Russian empire led by a totalitarian leader.
Speaking with a portrait of Tsar Nicholas II – who was murdered with his family by the Bolsheviks – propped on his desk, Strelkov speculated that the "Russian world" should include Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, and possibly Central Asia.
"The real separatists," he told the newspaper, "are the ones in Kiev, because they want to split Ukraine off from Moscow."
Strelkov, whose real name is Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, first came to prominence in April 2014, when he led a group of pro-Moscow separatists into the east Ukrainian city of Sloviansk, sparking the large-scale uprising against the government in Kiev.
It later emerged that he had served with the FSB, the Russian intelligence agency that replaced the KGB, for 18 years. When he retired in 2013, he was part of the Directorate for Combating International Terrorism. Strelkov is also a veteran of both the Soviet and Russian armies, and was charged with terrorism offences by the Ukrainian authorities during the current conflict.
In November last year, Strelkov said he took responsibility for triggering war in eastern Ukraine.
He has also established the Novorossiya movement, which supports rebels in the Crimea. The group's name, meaning "New Russia", is a historical term for southern and eastern Ukraine used by the Russian Empire.
The European Union added the group to its sanctions list in February this year.
White House spokesman Jay Carney on Thursday dismissed calls for a reconsideration of President Barack Obama's controversial regulation of the health care policies offered by religious organizations, one day after Catholic leaders repeated their offer to hash out an agreement.
“The solution that was reached here … has been reached, and we firmly believe that it achieves the goals that the president set,” Carney said at Thursday's White House press conference.
On Feb. 10 Obama announced a new regulation that forces religious groups to financially support activities they abhor, but that the government supports. In particular, the president directed religious organizations to provide insurance policies that offer free contraceptives.
But “government has no place defining religion and religious ministry,” said the Mar. 14 statement by the top-level administrative committee of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.
“If this [regulatory] definition is allowed to stand, it will spread throughout federal law, weakening its healthy tradition of generous respect for religious freedom and diversity … [and] is unprecedented in federal law, which has long been generous in protecting the rights of individuals not to act against their religious beliefs or moral convictions,” said the statement.
Carney was dismissive.
Obama “brought the process to a solution here that met his two objectives — to ensure that women across America … were able to get the same preventive services, including contraception services without having to pay for them, and that those who have religious objections … would not have to provide or pay.”
“That is the solution we reached,” he said.
Since then, Democratic partisans have portrayed objections by many religious denominations as a GOP “war on women,” and have said that portrayal has boosted their poll numbers.
On Wednesday the Catholic committee invited new negotiations with the administration.
“We will continue to accept any invitation to dialogue with the Executive Branch to protect the religious freedom that is rightly ours,” the statement said.
To derail Obama's edict, the committee also promised to promote advocacy by Catholic groups.
“We will continue our vigorous efforts at education and public advocacy. … We will continue to pursue legislation to restore the same level of religious freedom we have enjoyed until just recently. … We will continue to explore our options for relief from the courts, under the U.S. Constitution. … All of these efforts will proceed concurrently, and in a manner that is mutually reinforcing.”

Fresh Conservative / flickr) ” />Ronald Reagan campaigning in the Central Coast area in the 1960s. (Photo: Fresh Conservative / flickr) One of Guatemala's most brutal dictators has been found guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity. On Friday, Jose Efraín Ríos Montt was sentenced to 80 years in prison in a decision that marks the first time a ruler has been convicted of genocide in his own country. Rios Montt oversaw an extralegal regime in the early 1980s, ordering the killing of 1,771 Ixil Mayans in the name of eradicating a guerilla movement.
Incredibly, Montt's co-defendant, José Mauricio Rodríguez Sánchez, who served as director of intelligence during the same time period, was acquitted of the same charges. The current president of the nation, President Otto Pérez Molina, has also been implicated in the atrocities, though not charged.
Throughout the duration of the Ríos Montt dictatorship, his regime was the bloodiest on the American continent. Why did the world permit his brutality, and why did it take more than 30 years to successfully prosecute him? His genocidal campaigns, in full view to the world, were committed in real time.
The simple answer is the actions – and inactions – of US President Ronald Reagan, the man who provided cover for every tin-pot dictator on the continent. A better answer is the preeminence of “America,” with its mythological foundation and narrative. The best answer is the actions – or rather, inertia – of the citizens of the United States of America. It is we who permitted the atrocities of not simply this dictator, but all the military dictators on the continent during that bloodthirsty era.
The majority of US voters put Reagan in office, not once, but twice … and then rewarded his imperial reign by subsequently electing his vice president, Papa Bush, into office. And then he got airports, freeways and buildings named after him.
Former Congressman Dennis Kucinich recently called for a truth and reconciliation commission to investigate how the United States got itself into Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan (plus Yemen and Somalia). That would be an important step. However, before it takes place, a commission must be created to examine the US role in Central America, primarily in the 1980s, which resulted in the deaths and disappearances of hundreds of thousands of civilians from Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras. All these wars were financed by US tax dollars. All those ruthless dictators and their leading military officers were trained by the US military. Yet in Reagan-speak, the United States was simply spreading democracy (with heavy weaponry) in Central America – the same goal Bush claimed in launching the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And from a Reagan-based perspective, the hundreds of thousands of Central American victims were little brown people whose lives were irrelevant.
In Ríos Montt, we see the legacy of Reagan's World. During Guatemala's 36-year civil war, which officially ended in 1996, more than 200,000 of its citizens were killed. Tens of thousands more of its citizens were disappeared, brutalized and tortured. Indigenous (Mayan) peoples paid the heaviest price, with entire villages being razed and women routinely subjected to rape as a component of military strategy.
During the time of Ríos Montt and a long line of dictators before and after him, the military engaged in both genocidal and brutal anti-insurgent campaigns that targeted educators, student activists, catechists, religious and union organizers – anyone not in government who was deemed to have leadership qualities or potential, and anyone deemed to be supporting the guerrilla movement.
While each war in Central America was different, a common thread ran through them all: the US penchant for propping up military dictators, supplemented by attempts to reinstall ruthless regimes with virtually the same destructive results. US interventions and US imperialism did not begin in the 1980s, but it was Reagan-speak that turned these genocidal campaigns with resultant massacres into “freedom-loving” ventures. This violent era resulted in mass migrations to the United States in quantities not seen since the time of the Mexican Revolution.
Many of the migrants now spread across the United States are family, friends, and neighbors of the victims of genocide. Many still bear the painful scars of those genocidal years – scars that can never heal. To this day, many hundreds of thousands of survivors live among us, clamoring for justice. Putting Ríos Montt away for a little time will not undo the brutal campaigns of that era.
Taking a cue from Kucinich, perhaps we should begin in this country with a truth and reconciliation commission to examine first the US role in Central America, and then, its role in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
This would be a broad endeavor: to understand the apartheid regime of Guatemala, and to understand the conditions that allowed the cycle of vicious wars in Central America, one would have to probe deeper. One would have to probe the mythology of the very idea of America. When Kucinich made his call, he said we must go back to the original idea of America, because its founders envisioned a nation of human unity. I have a different take: the original idea of America was predicated on genocide, land theft, slavery, divine providence, westward expansion and manifest destiny (imperialism) and the denial of full human rights to everyone except landowning white males.
The original idea of America was predicated on ignorance and denial, falsehoods and myths. That is what made the Iraq War possible. That is what permitted Ríos Montt to operate with impunity. It is what permitted Reagan to view bloodthirsty murderers as “freedom fighters.” It is what propelled the Iran-Contra (drugs, missiles and guns) affair.
A recent conference in Phoenix, titled “Dismantling the Doctrine of Discovery,” examined precisely those myths – the ones that converted invaders into the legal and legitimate populations of “America,” while converting the native populations into hunted aliens. It is this doctrine that provides the best explanation for the Guatemalan genocide and for the violence and oppression that have wracked Central America, Mexico and the rest of the continent north and south.
At this conference, the attendees were in agreement that until the doctrine of discovery is dismantled, indigenous peoples will continue to be subjected to apartheid regimes, land theft, desecration of sacred sites, and efforts to eradicate the original cultures, languages and knowledges of this continent. The story of Ríos Montt and Guatemala is but one sliver of the history of the nation, one small sliver of the history of the United States and one tiny sliver of the history of this continent. Until this history is reconciled, any truth commission that doesn't examine the 520 years of invasions will not ferret out the continent's actual genocidal history.
The trial of Ríos Montt has been largely symbolic. In some respects, its symbolism is troubling. Beyond the symbolism, how does one bring justicia, as the Ixil peoples chanted upon Ríos Montt's conviction, to a nation with hundreds of thousands of victims? How does one bring justicia to a continent whose nation-states are founded upon injustice? One trial at a time?
Perhaps another small answer, provided by the attendees of the Phoenix gathering, is by no longer referring to these continents in the Western Hemisphere as “The Americas,” but rather as Abya Yala (“Land of Life” or “Land in Blossom,” among other translations), the name given to the continents by the Kuna people of Panama long before the arrival of Columbus. Is that too difficult to pronounce? Might it conjure up bothersome memories about the land we are actually standing upon and its original peoples?

The evidence is all around.
Direct observation: drive past the place any time of the day or night and it is like a ghost-town. A lone security guard and PI at the front door of the Ft Harrison hotel. Otherwise no sign of life. The Potemkin Village up Ft. Harrison is even sadder — 6 storefronts with their doors open and a lonely receptionist waiting for the visitor that never comes. Otherwise, one after the other, they are always completely empty but their lights are on and the windows are not covered (like every other building). Sandcastle parking lot half full at best. Parking lot behind the Osceola, empty. Westcoast parking lot empty. Oak Cove empty.
They cannot even fill Ruth Eckerd Hall for the New Year's event, so they hold it in the auditorium (while frantically regging people to build the “L. Ron Hubbard Hall.”) Flag is a wasteland.
We have not seen a “Flag Good News” item for some months. Jeff Mintz has gone silent. That can only mean one of two things (or both): The stats suck and even he cannot confront sending out their “weekly” “Good News” report with terrible downstats, or b) he got in trouble for sending it out because I publish it on the blog. In which case they cut their reach again. But even if number 2 is true, you can be sure number one is also true. Because if their stats were booming they would be sending it out and crowing about it and daring me to publish it on the blog.
We also see other indicators, and here is a new one.
Apparently they have now run out of Cause Resurgence pole dancers runners because they are sending the head honcho of the Cause Resurgence to… Albuquerque. Now that is desperation. They have probably managed to scrape up a grand total of 10 people from New Mexico who have taken services at Flag in the last decade. Not much return on this investment of time and effort. So, how can you afford the head of the “booming” Running Pgm to go out of town on a wasted effort like this? The only answer can be that she has nothing better to do…
Young Thug performs at Grant Park on July 31 in Chicago, Illinois. Photo: Erika Goldring/Getty Images
For one of the best rappers alive, Young Thug seems remarkably at ease. Most who wrangle that crown does it loudly: as the sneering villain, the smirking capitalist, the put-upon savior. But the Atlanta-born Jeffrey Williams, who just turned 23 and is facing a litany of gun and drug charges, and might yet be roped into a conspiracy to kill his idol, doesn't seem too worried. I've witnessed it up close.
At the end of July, less than two weeks after he was jailed for — of all things — a confrontation with a mall cop, Thug made it to his scheduled set at Chicago's Lollapalooza. There, he played “Halftime,” the song that Cobb County district attorneys used to implicate him in the same indictment that charged PeeWee Roscoe with domestic terrorism for Lil Wayne's tour-bus shooting back in April. Not the whole song, mind you. He rapped:
Got 100 million flat, like my motherfucking idol
I might eat it, I might lick it, but I swear I'll never bite ‘em
Every time I dress myself, it goes motherfucking viral
Pussy niggas stealing swag, bring my shit back like recycle
Then he cut the music. He cackled into the microphone. And he dropped “About the Money,” his massive collaboration with T.I. that finds him extolling the virtues of can openers and L.A. weed connects. What had started as a tense point of curiosity — some fans in DePaul tank-tops wondered loudly if the rapper would show up at all — had become one of the day's highlights: a loose, raucous set where the crowd was shouting everything down to the DJ drops. By the time Paul McCartney hit the main stage an hour later, Thug was already at O'Hare, taking pictures with Dennis Rodman, essentially living out the plot of Looper.
Both “Halftime” and “About the Money” argue for Thug as rap's most vital, most engaging voice right now. As Guru's maxim goes, Williams is blessed with — or, more accurate, has synthesized his influences into — one of the slipperiest, most malleable voices in hip-hop's history, not to mention a command of language that's thoroughly his own. When well-meaning rap fans and academics compare rapping to poetry, they do each medium a disservice. Rap is performative, and no one performs quite like Thug.
But each of those two songs exhibits a quietly engaging pen as well. “About the Money” has its coming-of-age bent (“I went from rags to riches to a feature with Tip / I went from Smart car to a bitch with some smart lips”); “Halftime,” its bizarre imagery (groupies are fashioned into a trident, a “flooded out” Jesus piece bumps up against New Orleans' literally flooded-out Ninth Ward). Perhaps most important, it's impossible to tell where the next bar is going, in your headphones or in the recesses of Thug's mind.
What follows are 20 essential Young Thug songs and collaborations across proper releases, mixtapes, and one-offs, starting when he slinked into the national spotlight in 2013. (For those curious, his three-part I Came From Nothing mixtape series has its share of standouts; this list is meant to trace his period as a widely visible trendsetter.) To put in perspective how prolific Thug has been in just a few years' time, consider the fact that this was cut for space. He continues this impressive pace with Hy!£UN35 (HiTunes, for the uninitiated), his proper retail debut expected out this fall.
“2 Cups Stuffed”
Five minutes into 1017 Thug, the 2013 mixtape that broke Young Thug to national audiences, you're not just implored to “lean, lean, lean, lean, leanleanlean,” you're learning how to spell. On first pass, “2 Cups Stuffed” sounds as if it's the work of two or three different vocalists. The hook (and its Fleming-esque urge to “go light on the ice”) starts off as a guttural bark, but by the top of the first verse it bleeds into a falsetto, or the closest approximation one can weave through trap drums.
“Nigeria,” Young Thug feat. Gucci Mane and PeeWee Longway
The din of Lil Wayne conspiracies obscures the fact that Thug first tied his wagon to another mid-2000s rap workhorse: Gucci Mane. 1017 Thug track “Nigeria” is the best of Thug's handful of collaborations with Mane. The song sees Thug pack the lines, “When I look at myself, look like a meal ticket,” “blowing trust funds,” and “I drove my mama crazy, then I went brazy” all into one brilliantly warbled verse.
“The Blanguage”
Lil Wayne used to be into erasure. When he was the Only Rapper Who Mattered, he did terrible things to well-meaning artists like Mike Jones — i.e., flipping his beat to the point that the original might as well not exist. But Wayne never successfully disappeared someone as big as Drake was in 2013. For their first proper release as Metro Thuggin, Thug and the wunderkind producer Metro Boomin essentially retracted “The Language” from Aubrey's tepid Nothing Was the Same. “The Blanguage” opens, “I fucked her then washed off my dick with the curtains inside of the Phantom”; Thug goes on declare himself “one slimy motherfucker, the devil ride my back like camels.” It doesn't get this dark in Scarborough.
“Danny Glover,” Young Thug and Bloody Jay
Does plan obsolescence extend to your wrist bones? There's probably something to be written about “Danny Glover” as a lethal screed against capitalism, what with its ten bands strewn about taxis and money measured in little people. At the very least, the song — bizarrely included on 2014's Black Portland, Thug's joint mixtape with Bloody Jay — is one of the most dizzyingly weird rap hits in recent memory. From the machine-gun syllables at the top of the second verse to the laughable “I don't like using profanity” aside, even down to the title, “Danny Glover” served as a sufficiently skull-rattling introduction.
“Blood,” DeJ Loaf feat. Young Thug and Birdman
DeJ Loaf had a runaway hit last year with “Try Me,” but her 2015 follow-up EP was woefully mismarketed by Columbia. If 2014 is her commercial high-water mark, she leveraged it for one of the best coed collabs in years. “Blood” is a tour de force for the Detroit native (how is a voice so thin, left so unexposed in the mix, so powerful?), but Thug's verse sidesteps comprehension. Like any good scene in film or TV, it's an exercise in escalation. After the first four bars (on “grindin' like a skater nigga”), his voice ramps up until it can't anymore. Then, to throw stakes on stakes, Thug steps fully into double time. Bonus points for out-shit-talking Baby on the outro: “As a matter of fact, I'm one of the biggest Bloods in fucking America.”
“Old English,” Salva feat. Young Thug, Freddie Gibbs, and A$AP Ferg
When L.A. producer Salva's “Old English” dropped last year, it was framed in some ways as a case-study in rap regionalism. Of course, Thug, Freddie Gibbs, and A$AP Ferg are too weird and/or too technical to be truly faithful representatives for their respective hometowns. Gary, Indiana–bred Gibbs is a more precise, more dynamic gangsta-rapper than nearly anyone in the subgenre since it loosened its pop-chart stranglehold in the late ‘90s. But neither he nor Memphis/Gotham hybrid Ferg go quite as left as Thug. His verse is probably the foremost study of cutlery in American music.
“Check”
When Thug's Barter 6, the stellar mixtape with a Wayne-baiting title, dropped this April, some complained that the set didn't have hits — no “Stoner,” no “Lifestyle.” Of course it does — they're just meaner, more skeletal, dripping in minor keys. Aside from bringing sheesh back into the American lexicon, “Check” showcases no fewer than four distinct flows, and nearly that many commas.
“Numbers”
The most surprising thing about Barter 6 wasn't that it was so slight — it was that the album ends with a three-song run that goes beyond “dark” and is simply, thoroughly sad. “Numbers” is laced with the sound of a thunderstorm, which would come off as clichéd if it weren't so fitting. Rappers talk all the time about being a product of their environment, but few threaten to “hit prison and fuck your father” right after they lament that kids these days are running around with guns.
“Guarantee”
Earlier this year, Thug's camp suffered through a brutal rash of leaks, with dozens of demos and finished songs being dumped unceremoniously onto the internet. Included were rough versions of songs that would appear on Barter 6, but also some cuts that seem to have been intended for Hy!£UN35. Much of the stronger material served as an ode to Thug's then-girlfriend; how do you top “If you got AIDS, I want it” as a gesture of devotion?
“Love Me”
“Big ol' cross like a pastor/ Pop that pussy like a snapper / Bitch, I'm bleeding, where is the napkins?” “Love Me,” another relic of the aforementioned leak, is the sincerest song ever to plug margarine, full stop. More than that, it's a beautiful, affecting cut that sets an awfully high bar for your wedding vows. It hinges on the same Auto-Tuned falsetto framework as Future's “Honest.”
“That's All”
For “That's All,” Goose — who was one of the principal contributors to Rich Gang's Tha Tour, Part One — provides Thug with the hardest beat that could ever be played at a YMCA back-to-school mixer. Another casualty of the leak epidemic, it could have sleepwalked to Top 40 rotation, as any song that invokes Ma$e should.
“Take Kare,” Rich Gang feat. Lil Wayne
Rich Gang has been a nebulous thing from the beginning. Back in 2013, when Wayne and Birdman were still on speaking terms, Cash Money/Young Money issued a self-titled Rich Gang compilation, complete with the usual suspects, plus Future, R. Kelly, and (there's no easy way to say this) Limp Bizkit. The following year, with Thug on the precipice of actual stardom, Birdman applied the Rich Gang banner to the sole collaboration between his new protégé with his label's standard bearer, Wayne. God knows if they set foot in the studio together, but “Take Kare” is startlingly good regardless. On the first verse, Thug doles out negative space and ad-libs as carefully as he does his lead vocals, and Wayne turns in one of his few truly showstopping performances this decade.
“Freestyle,” Rich Gang feat. Birdman
Last year, Thug and his fellow Atlantan Rich Homie Quan teamed up to run away with this immortal, inscrutable Rich Gang moniker. Their mixtape, Tha Tour, Part One, is named after a tour that never actually took place; it's also among the best full-length rap releases since Kendrick Lamar's good kid, m.A.A.d. city. The tape runs over 80 minutes, but it's preposterously consistent. When “Freestyle,” which is in many ways the LP's emotional center, starts over an hour in, you haven't waded through a bit of fat. Quan pulls more than his share of the weight: “My baby mama just put me on child support / Fuck a warrant, I ain't going to court / Don't care what them white folks say, I just wanna see my little boy.” But in the song's second half, Thug stares into the abyss: “I want Quan medication, he got pain pills / But I need to see my girl to make my pain heal / But I ain't never been in love, I don't know how pain feels.”
“Givenchy,” Rich Gang
Tha Tour opener “Givenchy” starts with a perfectly bizarre monologue from Birdman (“Boolin in the bando with a few bitches — and they go to church!”), but for the better part of four minutes, Thug is left to his own devices. He builds one long crescendo; in many ways, the writing circles the idea of loyalty, and “Givenchy” hits its climax right after he threatens to “pull up on your girl, lurking like a cop.” The middle portion is a lesson in using alliteration as percussion: “You can't ever diss me, baby, you know better.”
“See You,” Rich Gang
The piano on “See You” plays like something you'd find on the stock Halloween soundtracks at Party City. Thug flits back and forth between “Double-C cup — fuck the titties? I'll try it” and “I do not fuck with the Fed cops,” then gets grave with, “I am the black kid, worried are my folks.” What more of a sales pitch do you need? “I got bands on me — yes, I meant plural.”
“Tell Em (Lies),” Rich Gang
While Rich Homie Quan's “Milk Marie” gets shine as Tha Tour's premier (ahem) love song, “Tell Em (Lies)” is its best. “She gon' look over these bitches like Terms & Conditions” is a strong contender for the most romantic thing ever said about your laptop. And the “Tell Em” video doesn't hurt the song's case — Birdman flexes with the abandon and lack of self-awareness unique to a dad at his son's bachelor party.
“Who's on Top,” Rich Gang feat. MPA Duke and MPA Wicced
If anything, Rich Homie Quan's contributions to Tha Tour are grossly overlooked. But what note would the tape end on if not a fever pitch from Thug? He calls his favorite Haitians, he makes big dogs feel like midgets, he'll eat you alive. Then, just as the tape is coming to an end, the last chorus cuts off. No curtain calls yet.
“Lifestyle,” Rich Gang
Did you go outside last summer?
“I Know There's Gonna Be (Good Times),” Jamie xx feat. Young Thug and Popcaan
How about this summer?
“Pacifier”
You know how there's always one guy who will pedantically remind you that the monster wasn't named Frankenstein, but was rather Frankenstein's creation? Legendary record exec Lyor Cohen's new venture, 300 Entertainment, made the indefensible decision to put “Pacifier” up for sale the same day as the constitutionally questionable raid on Thug's Georgia home earlier this summer. The saving grace is that the Mike WiLL Made-It–produced song somehow catches the rapper at his poppiest and most experimental. Thug dances around the guitar chords, scatting just long enough to sneer at the police.

The 6th Tactical Fighter Squadron, also known as "Schwarze", of the 13th Night Fighter Air Division are a squadron that belonged to the Belkan Air Force during the Belkan War. They were led by the former pilot and war criminal of the Yuktobanian Air Force, Dominic Zubov and operated eight MiG-31 Foxhounds. Their aircraft bear black and red paint schemes.
They commonly use XLAA missiles to attack at long-ranges. When the squadron engages it splits into two units consisting of four aircraft each. One of the unit engages first, while the second unit engages later. The second unit's opening volleys usually consist of XLAA fire.
In the unlockable mission "The Gauntlet", they will always be the third set of opponents you face when playing on Ace Difficulty.

History
The 6th Tactical Fighter Squadron "Schwarze" (black in German/Belkan) had first, officially, seen combat during the Belkan War in 1995. During the war, the entire squadron gained a reputation of fear among both the military of Belka and the Allied Forces from the Osean Federation, the Republic of Ustio and the Kingdom of Sapin.
The 6th TFS was commonly assigned to missions aimed at intercepting Belkan aircraft attempting to defect and of any forces attempting to leave the battlefield whatever their reasons was. According to the military record from Sepp Bonhof, this squadron performed other unknown tasks as well. Like all units of the 13th Night Fighter Air Division or NFAD, the 6th TFS was never officially tried by Belka because of their actions, since they had completely unrestricted orders to engage both enemy and allied forces at will.
On May 28, the 6th Tactical Fighter Squadron was dispatched to assassinate a top ranking ace of the BAF or Belkan Air Force, attempting to defect to the Osean Federation. This pilot was named Wolfgang Buchner, but was also known by they comrades as "Huckebein the Raven". His orders were to sortie towards an undisclosed Belkan City (presumed to be a South Belkan city) and drop a nuclear weapon on it. Instead, the pilot attempted to flee the country evading his orders.
As the Schwarze Squadron, lead by Dominic Zubov, pursued Wolfgang, the defecting ace flew towards the infamous Airspace B7R that was known as "The Round Table". At that time, the allied "Operation: Battle-Axe" was under way. The 6th Tactical Fighter Squadron lost Huckebein, among the confusion of the Operation Battle-Axe, but, instead engaged the 66th AFU Galm of the Ustian Air Force 6th Air Division. All members of the Schwarze Squadron were shot down during their engagement.
With the end of the Belkan War, all members fled the country, changed their identities or seemed to disappear.

DAYTON, OHIO, May 13, 1900
Mr. Octave Chanute, Esq.
Chicago, Ill.
Dear Sir;
For some years I have been afflicted with the belief that flight is possible to man. My disease has increased in severity and I feel that it will soon cost me an increased amount of money if not my life. I have been trying to arrange my affairs in such a way that I can devote my entire time for a few months to experiment in this field.
My general ideas of the subject are similar to those held by most practical experimenters, to wit: that what is chiefly needed is skill rather than machinery. The flight of the buzzard and similar sailors is a convincing demonstration of the value of skill, and the partial needlessness of motors. It is possible to fly without motors, but not without knowledge & skill. This I conceive to be fortunate, for man, by reason of his greater intellect, can more reasonably hope to equal birds in knowledge, than to equal nature in the perfection of her machinery.
Assuming then that Lilienthal was correct in his ideas of the principles on which man should proceed, I conceive that his failure was due chiefly to the inadequacy of his method, and of his apparatus. As to his method, the fact that in five years' time he spent only about five hours, altogether, in actual flight is sufficient to show that his method was inadequate. Even the simplest intellectual or acrobatic feats could never be learned with so short practice, and even Methuselah could never have become an expert stenographer with one hour per year for practice. I also conceive Lilienthal's apparatus to be inadequate not only from the fact that he failed, but my observations of the flight of birds convince me that birds use more positive and energetic methods of regaining equilibrium than that of shifting the center of gravity.
With this general statement of my principles and belief I will proceed to describe the plan and apparatus it is my intention to test. In explaining these, my object is to learn to what extent similar plans have been tested and found to be failures, and also to obtain such suggestions as your great knowledge and experience might enable you to give me. I make no secret of my plans for the reason that I believe no financial profit will accrue to the inventor of the first flying machine, and that only those who are willing to give as well as to receive suggestions can hope to link their names with the honor of its discovery. The problem is too great for one man alone and unaided to solve in secret.
My plan then is this. I shall in a suitable locality erect a light tower about one hundred and fifty feet high. A rope passing over a pulley at the top will serve as a sort of kite string. It will be so counterbalanced that when the rope is drawn out one hundred & fifty feet it will sustain a pull equal to the weight of the operator and apparatus or nearly so. The wind will blow the machine out from the base of the tower and the weight will be sustained partly by the upward pull of the rope and partly by the lift of the wind. The counterbalance will be so arranged that the pull decreases as the line becomes shorter and ceases entirely when its length has been decreased to one hundred feet. The aim will be to eventually practice in a wind capable of sustaining the operator at a height equal to the top of the tower. The pull of the rope will take the place of a motor in counteracting drift. I see, of course, that the pull of the rope will introduce complications which are not met in free flight, but if the plan will only enable me to remain in the air for practice by the hour instead of by the second, I hope to acquire skill sufficient to overcome both these difficulties and those inherent to flight. Knowledge and skill in handling the machine are absolute essentials to flight and it is impossible to obtain them without extensive practice.
The method employed by Mr. Pilcher of towing with horses in many respects is better than that I propose to employ, but offers no guarantee that the experimenter will escape accident long enough to acquire skill sufficient to prevent accident. In my plan I rely on the rope and counterbalance to at least break the force of a fall. My observation of the flight of buzzards leads me to believe that they regain their lateral balance, when partly overturned by a gust of wind, by a torsion of the tips of the wings. If the rear edge of the right wing tip is twisted upward and the left downward the bird becomes an animated windmill and instantly begins to turn, a line from its head to its tail being the axis. It thus regains its level even if thrown on its beam ends, so to speak, as I have frequently seen them. I think the bird also in general retains its lateral equilibrium, partly by presenting its two wings at different angles to the wind, and partly by drawing in one wing, thus reducing its area. I incline to the belief that the first is the more important and usual method.
In the apparatus I intend to employ I make use of the torsion principle. In appearance it is very similar to the "double-deck" machine with which the experiments of yourself and Mr. Herring were conducted in 1896-7. The point on which it differs in principle is that the cross-stays which prevent the upper plane from moving forward and backward are removed, and each end of the upper plane is independently moved forward or backward with respect to the lower plane by a suitable lever or other arrangement. By this plan the whole upper plane may be moved forward or backward, to attain longitudinal equilibrium, by moving both hands forward or backward together. Lateral equilibrium is gained by moving one end more than the other or by moving them in opposite directions. If you make a square cardboard tube two inches in diameter and eight or ten long and choose two sides for your planes you will at once see the torsional effect of moving one end of the upper plane forward and the other backward, and how this effect is attained without sacrificing lateral stiffness. My plan is to attach the tail rigidly to the rear upright stays which connect the planes, the effect of which will be that when the upper plane is thrown forward the end of the tail is elevated, so that the tail assists gravity in restoring longitudinal balance.
My experiments hitherto with this apparatus have been confined to machines spreading about fifteen square feet of surface, and have been sufficiently encouraging to induce me to lay plans for a trial with a full-sized machine. My business requires that my experimental work be confined to the months between September and January and I would be particularly thankful for advice as to a suitable locality where I could depend on winds of about fifteen miles per hour without rain or too inclement weather. I am certain that such localities are rare.
I have your Progress in Flying Machines and your articles in the Annuals of'95,'96, & '97, as also your recent articles in the Independent. If you can give me information as to where an account of Pilcher's experiments can be obtained I would greatly appreciate your kindness.
Yours truly,
Wilbur Wright
This extremely confident letter from one half of the Wright Brothers - Wilbur - was their first contact with renowned engineer Octave Chanute , an aviation pioneer and author of Progress in Flying Machines who went on to offer the brothers much invaluable advice over the coming years. It was written three years prior to their first controlled flight and presents their plans to Chanute with a view to obtaining some guidance in return. In the letter, Wilbur also mentions the failures of Otto Lilienthal , a fellow aviator who was among the first to fly successfully using a glider. He passed away in 1896 after falling and breaking his spine.All 5 pages of the letter, in large format, can be seen here: 1 Transcript follows.
' Just how close do we have to be to RTLM (Hutu Power Radio) for anyone to see the parallel and say, "That's enough, the people making this kind of threats are off the air for good."? (You might recall from your watching of Hotel Rwanda that the hosts at RTLM gave information on where the Tutsis were located after talking about crushing the Tutsis like cockroaches. Note: those hosts are now serving jail time for war crimes.) Is it going to take a few more murders of the targets of right wing talk radio host's ire for someone to act? And by someone I mean their own management. And if management doesn't act, showing us in writing the warnings to Savage along with his signed agreement posted on his website that he won't do this, then they need to pay a financial price. That is the only thing that might get them to act. The government will not act unless the EXACT right type of murder or violent assault happens. I don't think that will ever happen. Savage knows he needs to avoid certain words and phrases. He knows that unless it is spoken in-person to the person carrying out the murder the people defending the hosts will work on the "he has his right to free speech!" line. All talk radio and TV hosts know this, so they dance around it and practically demand that the people on the LEFT defend them. '
' Here's the quote: I am calling upon all people in the media who have been harassed by this Stalinist group, Media Matters, to join forces and publish the names of the people in Media Matters and put their pictures up on their Web sites. What's good for the goose is good for the gander. In the next few weeks you can expect me on michaelsavage.com to give you full pictures and other pertinent information about the individuals who are conducting a campaign against Michael Savage and other conservatives in the media. Let's see how they like it. But isn't it interesting that this staunch defender of the First Amendment is trying to bully other people from their lawful exercise of that right? I guess he supports free speech as long as it's speech with which he agrees. What's also interesting to me is the "other pertinent information" part. What information could that be? Their favorite color? How about address, where they work, that sort of thing? You know, the type of information that would be needed by someone if they were, say, stalking a person? So, Savage, go ahead and post that information. But you'd better drop on your knobby knees and pray that none of your mouth-breathing followers gets it in their head to "avenge" the "wrongs" done to you by your "enemies." Or do you like the way you look in stripes? '
YOUTUBE: MEDIA MATTERSThese are not idle threats or harmless pranks. We've seen people murdered after being targeted by these Nazi wannabee's. Their threadbare ideology is based upon anger and hatred and violence. Many "conservatives" worship guns and threaten to kill anyone who would take them away. Right-wing extremists in America have perpetrated more violent acts and killed more people than the Left ever did, by far. Al Qaida is nothing compared to the Aryan Nation, the American Nazi Party, the Ku Klux Klan, et al. They've been around for over a hundred years, shooting and bombing, burning and lynching, terrorizing and intimidating the whole country.Now the Right has taken control of much of our public airwaves. 24/7/52 they spew hatred and foment violence all across the nation on the radio and on TV. It's not just political bluster or ideological blather now. It's stalking and targeting and calling for violence against civilians and government officials, even the President of the United States. If anyone on the Left had even hinted at this sort of thing, they would have been shut down and locked up long ago.In a way, the Left is complicit in all this. By failing to use the legitimate tools of the law, they are allowing a spark to become a flame. If Obama and company do not do something about this media-inspired threat, the flame may become a conflagration. That is the expressed intent of the political arsonists on the Right. It needs to be stopped now, legally.Here's what Spocko had to say about the recent terroristic threats by Michael Savage against Media Matters, and the Left's response. Read the whole story on his site:SPOCKO'S BRAINOUR RESPONSE:You're just trying to get our hopes up with that story about RTLM, aren't you? Of course, some of us would have to be hacked to death first, but, as long as it isn't me, it's worth it.Actually, we've had laws against this sort of thing for a long time. They've been "reading the Riot Act" since 1792, aka the Militia Act in the US, now chapter 15 of title 10, United States Code. Peaceful speakers at rallies that got out of handhave been prosecuted and even killed just for speaking. Four anarchist leaders were hung just forviolence in the Haymarket Affair in 1886. The Chicago Seven were charged with "conspiracy" after the police riotedin 1968. I think the right deserves a taste of this very old medicine, which is still on the books. It would even be fair, for once. We don't have to actually hang them. We're still liberals. Lethal injection would be fine. After a fair trial, of course.Howard Stern and Infinity Broadcasting have been fined millions of dollars for his harmless adolescent antics. Several of the broadcast TV 'Nets have been fined for various audio & video "accidents" which merely titillated some and offended others in the audience. The same laws could be used against NewsCorp & ClearChannel, but Obama is not changing Bushco policies on giving the Right a free pass. The law specifically forbids:as well asThe FEC could also be investigating the endless free campaign commercials on behalf of the GOP disguised as programming by the right-wing 'Nets, but they're not. Violations can be reported in online complaint forms from both agencies, but I've yet to hear of any action.Part of the problem is, there are just so bloody many of these hate-mongers and rabble-rousers; and they have so many sponsors. Taking action against all of them is impossible, and taking action against just a few of them is ineffectual. Some major action has to be initiated by Obama, or by a citizens' group to make a huge example of one of the main instigators of right-wing terror. They have the RICO Act, the Patriot Acts, the FCC regulations the "Riot Act" and the campaign finance laws. They don't need any new laws. They do need political will.The thing is, the very same media outlets control, manipulate and distort perceptions of public opinion to the point where the Democrats don't seem to realize that they are in the majority, and that most of us are sick of Savage and his ilk, and want to know why they haven't been shut down. We have to find a way to break through the Blue Dog & Clinton-Bush appointee wall of silence, and demand that Obama do something, while he still can.He's never going to make friends with these nutjobs. And why should he? They're only 5 or 10% of the electorate, at most. The other 90% are tired of their incitements to violence, fighting words and crying fire in a crowded theater. We need to make the FCC, FEC, FBI and Homeland Security stop them now, before we have a Kristallnacht or a Reichstag Fire. Or worse. That's what we're headed for, if we don't do something about it. How far would an extreme left-wing nutjob get with these kinds of threats and incitements to violence? How many doctors and nurses have to die before these terrorist Republican mullahs have their electronic madrassah's shut down?SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER

IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM YOUR BLOGGERS:SUPPORT OUR TROOPS: BRING THEM ALL HOME ALIVE, NOW!
They're using Android. Pedronet via Flickr Apple's strategy of aligning the iPhone with a single mobile carrier appears to have backfired in China, where Samsung has opened up a huge smartphone market-share lead.
According to Bloomberg, the iPhone has a 7.5% share of China's smartphone sales, while Samsung has a 24.3% share.
This share makes Apple the 5th largest smartphone seller in the country, while Samsung is No. 1.
Samsung has sold phones through all three major China mobile carriers since 2009: China Unicom (~200 million subscribers), China Telecom (129 million subscribers), and China Mobile (655 million subscribers).
Apple, meanwhile, has exclusively sold through China Unicom.
Apple launched sales through China Telecom last week, which should help boost its share. But China Telecom, though huge by western standards, is the smallest of the three carriers.
The granddaddy of China's mobile market, China Mobile, is expected to wait to sell the iPhone until Apple releases an LTE version, which China Mobile expects by the end of this year. An estimated 15 million "jail-broken" iPhones are already used on China Mobile's 2G network, even without the carrier actually selling the phone.
The reason market share is important is that smartphones have become a platform market, in which developers build applications that run on top of various operating systems. As with Microsoft's Windows, if one platform achieves a dominant share, developers tend to gravitate to it, at the expense of other platforms. So one risk to Apple in China (and worldwide) is that Android might become the dominant mobile development platform.
Google's Android operating system, which powers Samsung's phones, is the global market-share leader with nearly 50% of the market, though Apple regained a lot of share last quarter on strong sales of the iPhone 4S.
Presumably, Apple's sales through China Telecom will help it close the gap with Samsung in China. But until Apple sells the phone through China Mobile, Samsung will likely remain China's dominant smartphone maker.

After beating the Heat, the Clippers have reason to celebrate their notable growth over last season.LOS ANGELES -- A relative calm has settled over the Los Angeles Clippers. It's a little disarming. There's no talk of supernatural curses that cause freak injuries, or Vinny Del Negro's job security, or whether pending free agent Chris Paul will bolt for greener pastures at season's end.
Instead, the Clippers have been quietly going about their business. They've banked impressive wins over Memphis, the Lakers, San Antonio and now the Heat. They've established the best reserve backcourt in the NBA with Eric Bledsoe and Jamal Crawford, kept their stars' minutes in check for what could be a long spring of basketball, and just recorded the franchise's 56th consecutive sellout at Staples Center.
There's a hazard in making wholesale evaluations of NBA teams in November -- eight days ago the Clippers were coming off home losses to Golden State and Cleveland -- but the team carries itself with a palpable confidence. Last season, it was swagger; this season, gravitas.
If the Clippers present themselves as legitimate title contenders, as Heat coach Erik Spoelstra suggested after watching his team get waxed by the Clippers on Wednesday night, that spirit comes from Chris Paul, point god.
Paul was the team's undeniable leader in 2011-12, but the Clippers weren't yet the living, breathing actualization of what a Chris Paul team should be. Paul didn't arrive in Los Angeles until the eve of training camp and there was simply no time to make his vision a reality.
But over the summer, Paul went to work. At his urging, the Clippers went out and acquired or re-signed eight players with six seasons of experience or more. Twice over the past four days, Paul has hit on a specific talking point that conveys his doctrine as team leader.
“Like I said last game, we have guys who know who they are,” Paul said on Wednesday, echoing one of his big themes from Sunday's win over Atlanta.
Paul's sermon that afternoon?
“That's the key to everything: They know who they are,” Paul said, speaking of the veteran reserves on Sunday. “They're not going to try to do anything outside of themselves. They know what to do. They know what it takes … They're not going to try to be something that they're not. That's happens when you're young. When you're young, you're trying to find yourself, trying to figure out your purpose in this league. But for those guys, they know who they are.”
It's a clear window into Paul, the finest kind of control freak. He'll happily mentor a young supernova point guard like Eric Bledsoe. Paul is well aware that his frontcourt of Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan are cornerstones of the team's core going forward. But he's not interested in entertaining too many undefined variables on his squad. Paul wants teammates with a specific kind of pedigree. There's probably no empirical or even aesthetic case for starting guard Willie Green and playing him 19 minutes per game. “But Willie is just a professional,” Paul said on Wednesday.
Professionalism was one ingredient that was missing last season. Out of the gate, the Clippers were like a kid with a bad reputation. They were tagged as flash over substance, unwilling to engage in the rigorous work that comes with building an elite defense.
This season, the flopper rap has disappeared. Griffin knows when he's being messed with by the likes of Zach Randolph, and brushes it off. Clippers basketball is a more refined product -- but it's also more fun, because for all the talk of Lob City a year ago, the team was unwatchable at times. With Bledsoe blossoming, Jordan building confidence, and a lightning bug like Crawford providing nightly entertainment, there's a breezy pace to the Clippers' game.
A certain levity also surrounds the team. Paul is a serious guy, while Griffin is scary-intense on the floor, but the locker room is yet another reflection of Paul's worldview. It's a place where young sons congregate with their fathers after games. On the court, Griffin has learned to laugh at himself. When the ball was tipped out to Griffin in the fourth quarter on Wednesday about 28 feet from the basket, Griffin deliberately bent his knees and poised himself for a shot. Cue the laugh track from the Clippers' crowd. Griffin broke out in a smile before passing the ball off.
There's still work to be done. A defense ranked 18th last season has improved to 11th, but coverage schemes still need some tightening. The Clippers have played only one of their eight games away from Staples Center, and even the best teams (witness Miami) take lumps on the road. Coach Vinny Del Negro has an embarrassment of riches at his disposal. When Chauncey Billups and Grant Hill return and Lamar Odom is restored to full health, there will be even more mouths to feed. Bledsoe, with his 22.2 Player Efficiency Rating (PER), logs only 18 minutes a night in deference to the veterans.
These are all manageable issues for the Clippers -- first-world problems.
Starbucks received the highest satisfaction rating among franchise coffee chains in a recent consumer survey.
The Korea Consumer Agency said Monday that Starbucks scored 3.83 points out of 5 in its survey in June of 1,000 adults on their preferences for coffee shops. The Seattle-based coffee chain ranked first in a similar survey in 2015.
It topped the list in four of six categories: shop accessibility, customer service, taste and variety of items, and overall preference.
Angel-in-Us Coffee, Tom N Toms and A Twosome Place shared the second spot with 3.73 points. Hollys placed fifth (3.72), followed by Coffee Bean (3.71) and Ediya (3.7). Angel-in-Us, which came last in 2015, jumped to second this year with a 0.15-point rise in score. It placed first in terms of convenience, edging out Starbucks.
Ediya dropped to last place from No. 2 in 2015. The chain, which offers relatively low prices, took top spot in terms of price but ranked bottom in terms of taste and variety of items, and customer service.
"People now tend to value service more than price," said Ma Mi-young of the KCA.
Will polar bears survive in a warmer world? UCLA life scientists present new evidence that their numbers are likely to dwindle.
As polar bears lose habitat due to global warming, these biologists say, they will be forced southward in search of alternative sources of food, where they will increasingly come into competition with grizzly bears.
To test how this competition might unfold, the UCLA biologists constructed three-dimensional computer models of the skulls of polar bears and grizzly bears -- a subspecies of brown bears -- and simulated the process of biting. The models enabled them to compare the two species in terms of how hard they can bite and how strong their skulls are.
"What we found was striking," said Graham Slater, a National Science Foundation-funded UCLA postdoctoral scholar in ecology and evolutionary biology and lead author of the research. "The polar bear and brown bear can bite equally hard, but the polar bear's skull is a much weaker structure."
The implication is that polar bears are likely to lose out in competition for food to grizzlies as warmer temperatures bring them into the same environments, because grizzlies' stronger skulls are better suited to a plant-rich diet, said Slater and Blaire Van Valkenburgh, UCLA professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and senior author of the research.
"The result for polar bears may be lower weight, smaller and fewer litters, less reproductive success, fewer that would survive to adulthood, and dwindling populations," Van Valkenburgh said. "Then you can get into an extinction vortex, where a small population becomes even smaller in a downward spiral to extinction.
"To people who say polar bears can just change their diet, we are saying they will change their diet -- they will have to -- but it probably will not be sufficient for them, especially if they are co-existing with grizzly bears. Their skull is relatively weak and not suited to adapting its diet. We did not expect to find what we found."
"This is one additional piece of evidence that things look pretty bleak for the polar bear if current trends continue," Slater said.
The research, federally funded by the National Science Foundation, was published this month in the online journal PLoS ONE, a publication of the Public Library of Science.
Polar bears are a "marvelous example of rapid adaptation to an extreme environment," Slater said. "The fact that we can lose them equally rapidly as a result of human-mediated climate change is rather striking. Polar bears are very well suited to do what they do, but they are highly specialized and not well suited to doing much else."
It could take quite some time for polar bears to go extinct, Van Valkenburgh said, but they are likely to become much more rare than today.
Polar bears are losing habitat as a result of global warming and the associated loss of arctic sea ice, which they use to hunt for seals, Van Valkenburgh and Slater said. But could they survive on an alternative food source?
"Our results suggest that this is not too likely," Slater said. "The polar bear's skull is a relatively weak structure that is not suited to diets consisting of a lot of plant material like that of the brown bear. As climate change continues, polar bears will be forced to move south in search of resources, while brown bears move north as their climate becomes milder. When these two species meet, as they have already begun to, it seems that brown bears will easily out-compete polar bears. Our findings should serve as a warning that polar bears may not be flexible enough to survive if current trends continue.
"Chewing a lot of vegetables takes quite a lot of force to grind up," Slater said. "Grizzly bears are well suited to eating these kinds of food, but the polar bear is not well suited for it. The grizzly has a much more efficient skull for eating these kinds of foods."
In Canada, grizzly bears are moving north and are already in polar bear territory, Van Valkenburgh and Slater said.
The life scientists -- whose co-authors include UCLA undergraduates Leeann Louis and Paul Yang and graduate student Borja Figueirido from Spain's Universidad de Malaga, Campus Universitario de Teatinos -- studied two adult male skulls from museums, one of a polar bear from Canada, the other of a grizzly from Alaska. They built 3-D computer models of the skulls and then analyzed their biomechanics.
"We can apply muscle forces to the skull to simulate biting, and we can measure how hard the animal could bite. We can measure stress and strain in the skull as well," Slater said. "We found that while the stresses in the grizzly bear skull are relatively low, the same bites in the polar bear produce much more stress. Combined with other evidence from Blaire's laboratory, this tells us that the smaller teeth of polar bears are less suited to diets that consist of plants, grass, vegetation and berries."
"Polar bears would not be able to break up the food as well in their mouths and would not digest it as well," Van Valkenburgh said.
In the timeline of evolution, polar bears evolved from the brown bear very recently, and the two are very closely related, Van Valkenburgh and Slater said. Genetic studies indicate that the split between polar bears and brown bears occurred only 500,000 to 800,000 years ago -- the most recent split between any of the eight bear species.
Despite the recentness of the split between these two species, their skulls and teeth are extremely different, probably as a result of where they live (arctic versus temperate regions) and the differences in their diets. Grizzly bears have very large molar teeth, while polar bears have teeth that are much smaller. Polar bears eat seal blubber, which is soft and does not require much chewing, while brown bears consume many plants.
The biologists investigated the rate at which skull shape has evolved in the bear family. They found that the rate of evolution in the branch of the bear family tree leading to the polar bear was twice as fast as the rates in other branches of the tree; it appears that skull shape evolved extremely rapidly in polar bears.
Polar bears probably evolved very rapidly in response to glacial climates during the ice ages, Slater said.
"You don't see many bears that look like polar bears, and the difference in skull shape evolved very rapidly," Slater said.
A man was killed early Friday morning after he returned inside of a burning Plano home to retrieve his cell phone. The incident happened just after 1:00 a.m. at a house on Haggard Street, near East Park Boulevard and State Highway 75.
Neighbors called 911 to report the house fire and crews arrived just three minutes later to find the building fully engulfed in flames. A total of three people lived in the home — the victim, his daughter and his roommate.
“The tragedy here is that the three adults living in the home actually made it out of the home, realized that they had no way to call 911, no phone with them,” explained Capt. Peggy Harrell with the Plano Fire Department. “So, two of the residents — two males — actually reentered the burning home.”
One of those men, who has not yet been identified but is said to be in his early 70s, did not make it back out alive. There were no other injuries were reported. The cause of the fire, which was extinguished quickly, is still under investigation.
Neighbors said that they are sad, wishing that their longtime friend had not gone back inside of his house while it was on fire. He had been living in the home for more than 20 years. “He could've come to any of the neighbors' houses to call 911,” said Nakita Weseman. “I know he realized, probably, he didn't have his cell phone, but that's definitely replaceable. He wasn't.”
Harrell warned residents to never run inside of a burning structure, noting that nine out of 10 people, nationally, do not make it back out alive. “Fire and smoke conditions change rapidly, and the fast-moving fire and toxic smoke can quickly incapacitate a person and make it impossible to get out,” said Harrell.

People who vote for nationalist and republican parties in Northern Ireland do not necessarily support a united Ireland, the Secretary of State has said.
Launching the Conservatives' Northern Ireland manifesto, James Brokenshire said the conditions for calling a border poll on unification were "not remotely satisfied".
The constitutional question has gained greater public prominence since the UK voted to leave the EU - a referendum that saw 56 per cent of the electorate in Northern Ireland vote to remain.
Under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, the incumbent secretary of state is obliged to call a border poll if there is evidence of a shift in public opinion towards Irish unity.
In March's snap Assembly poll, Stormont lost its long-standing unionist majority for the first time. At Westminster, there are 11 outgoing unionist MPs and seven nationalist and republicans.
At the manifesto launch in Belfast, Mr Brokenshire was asked whether a similar reversal of the pro-unionist majority of MPs in the general election would influence the test on a border poll.
"I remain satisfied on the basis of all reliable indicators of the continued support for the devolved administration, the principles and the structures and institutions that are underpinned within the Belfast Agreement (1998) and its successors, and I am very clear that the requirements for a border poll are not remotely satisfied," he said.
"Obviously we keep these issues under very close and careful review but I think in terms of the way people vote, that people may vote for one party but that doesn't necessarily mean they want to see a change to the institutions, that they want to see a change to the foundations that underpin all of that stability that has been achieved from the Belfast Agreement and thereafter."
At the same time the Tories were launching their manifesto for the north, across the city the SDLP called for a post-Brexit border poll at their own manifesto launch.

Mr Brokenshire said legislation required the incoming government to keep the situation under review.
"As I see it, the support for those institutions, the support for Northern Ireland remaining a core part of the United Kingdom, remains very firmly there," he said.
The Conservative manifesto document rules out any possibility of the region being administered on the basis of joint authority between the UK and Irish Republic if a new powersharing executive is not formed following the resumption of negotiations after the General Election.

Immigration: glass half empty or half full
by Guido Bolaffi - 2017.04.26
To explain why immigration is such an important card played by right-wing populists and why analysts, each convinced of their explanations, continue to haggle, without consensus, is a difficult task, but not an impossible one. Take for example, the two viewpoints on the issue represented, on one hand, by Mckinsey Global Institute (MGI) in their report “People On The Move :global migration's impact and opportunity”, and, on the other, the results of an in-depth investigation published a few days ago by the Los Angeles Times, specifically regarding the construction industry in California, “Immigrants flooded California construction. Worker pay sank, here's why”.
Let's start with MGI, according to which immigration not only has an enormous added value for the overall economy (in 2015 alone, billions of dollars were divided among Usa, 2000; Germany, 550; England, 390; and Australia, 330), but is also a stimulous for technological and entrepreneurial innovation; a mecchanism for combatting the aging demographics of industrialized nations, and, here's the best and most important of their report's highlights: has none of the negative characteristics that are usually attributed to it. Because it does not take work away from nationals nor does it contribute to declining wages, and in the medium period, it contributes more to public coffers than it takes out. A blessing in disguise, that according to Mckinsey, if industrialized nations were able to reduce the salary gap that penalizes immigrants with respect to what locals get paid, by a mere 5/10 %, the economy would earn between 800 and1000 billion dollars.
A snapshot completely antithetical to the one provided by the Los Angeles Times. That on this issue, it should be reminded, was very visibly opposed to Trump's extravagance and threats wielded at San Francisco, a city that he defined as a “sanctuary”, because illegal immigrants there were not able to be arrested by Federal Agents. So, what did the paper's investigation reveal, then? Quite simply, that local workers in the building sector got supplanted by immigrants. More or less, like tractors did to horses in the agricultural sector, once upon a time. In addition: a) the wages of construction workers are 5% lower than they were 50 years ago; b) the percentage of “non natives” in the total workforce, has gone from 13% to almost 50%; c) unionized workers, once representing 100% of the total, are now represented by 1 worker in 10, having a union card. A completely different picture than the bright, sunny one painted by Mckinsey. The reality is that immigration, as a phenomenon of social-economic modernization, produces some degree of innovation and increased productivity, but with it, brings heavy costs and a myriad of problems. Thus, it seems appropriate to observe that, perhaps one should not only partake of the full half of the glass and leave the empty half to all the others.
Earlier this year, as we were suffering through #Winter2014, a vision appeared that momentarily wafted us into a warmer place. It was of a new Narragansett Beer offering: a Del's Shandy.
This is a collaboration with Del's Frozen Lemonade, another creation from Rhode Island that finally made its way to NYC last summer. And the slushy lemon drink can only make beer better. And vodka, for that matter.
The special edition has now hit the shelves, and Narragansett tells us the mash-up is "priced at $8.99 [and] available this week in six packs of 16-ounce tallboy cans throughout Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York. Multiple production runs are planned through the summer, so the product should be available into August."
Narragansett's president Mark Hellendrung says, “When it came to our second ‘Hi Neighbor Mash Up' collaboration, nothing reminded us of childhood summers on Rhode Island beaches more than Del's. Given the sessionable style of our Lager, and the growing popularity of shandys, we knew a collaboration with Del's would create a quintessential summer brew that generations of New Englanders would be thrilled about." The company promises it will deliver "an effervescent, citrus blast backed by just enough sweet malt."
UPDATE: Here's where you can buy it in NYC...
DETROIT - A police officer who has been with the Detroit Police Department for the past four years has been charged in connection to the murder of a man in Highland Park.
Elijah Lately, 25, is accused of knowing about a conspiracy to kill Brandon Rice and doing nothing to help stop it. Lately is charged with two counts of lying to a police officer during a violent crime investigation.
Rice was killed April 23 in the 300 block of Elmhurst in Highland Park. Dmarco Hoskins is charged with murder, conspiracy and witness intimidation in Rice's death. A pretrial conference is Friday.
Rice was to testify against Hoskins in a separate case.
A four-month investigation by the Detroit Homicide Task Force led to charges against Lately. The Wayne County Prosecutor's office says Lately knew of the plan to kill Rice, the identities of people involved and details about the homicide scene. He was identified as a potential witness to the murder and denied twice any involvement in or knowledge of it, according to the Prosecutor's Office.
"The allegations against the officer in this case are deeply disturbing. I would like to commend the Detroit Homicide Task Force and the members of my office for their excellent work," said Prosecutor Kym L. Worthy.
He has been suspended by the department. He was arrested and is being held in jail on a $400,000 bond.

Car manufacturer Tesla is reportedly recalling 11,000 of their Model X SUVs due to a malfunctioning seat issue.
CNBC reports that Tesla Inc. is recalling 11,000 Model X SUVs as the rear seats might not correctly lock into place. The issue may have been caused by improperly tightened cables within the mechanism of the car which prevents the left seat from locking in its upright position. If improperly locked, the seat could move forward during a crash.
Tesla told CNBC in a statement, “During recent internal testing, Tesla determined that a small number of cables in the second row fold-flat seats in some 2016 and 2017 Model X vehicles may need to be adjusted. Although Tesla has not received reports of any issues or accidents relating to this condition, we will be conducting a voluntary recall to inspect the affected vehicles and confirm whether any adjustment is needed.”
Tesla claimed that the issue can be easily repaired with the company's mobile repair service, or that owners can take their cars to a licensed Tesla Service Center. Tesla has currently reported no injuries from the malfunction after the issue was discovered during internal testing.
A conservative judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit argued on Monday that women who were 150 miles from the nearest abortion clinic because of new restrictions passed by the state last year could drive at least 75 miles an hour and their rights would not be infringed.
At a Monday hearing in New Orleans, lawyers for the Center for Reproductive Rights explained to a three judge panel that the new abortion restrictions meant that women in the Rio Grande Valley must make a 300-mile round trip to the nearest clinic in Corpus Christi to obtain care.
Judge Edith Jones, however, seemed unconcerned, informing lawyers that the speed limit was 75 miles an hour.
“Do you know how long that takes in Texas at 75 miles an hour?” she asked. “This is a peculiarly flat and not congested highway.”
Think Progress pointed out on Tuesday that Texas requires women to go through an ultrasound, counseling and a mandatory 24-waiting period before obtaining an abortion. So, women in the Rio Grande Valley would have to make the 300-mile round trip to Corpus Christi twice.
Jones, who was appointed to the Fifth Circuit by former President Ronald Reagan in 1985, is currently facing a judicial review for suggesting that Hispanics and African-Americans were “predisposed to crime.”

The next Star Trek film is coming sooner than you think. It's scheduled to wrap production in the fall, at which point it will be edited into a 90-minute feature starring well-known actors and boasting a deep bench of design and production talent.
But this one won't be co-starring Chris Pine and Zoe Saldana.
The latest from J.J. Abrams' high-octane movie reboot franchise is still slated for a painfully distant 2016 release. In the meantime, though, Trek fans have written, produced, and directed their own—funded via Kickstarter.
Star Trek: Axanar will tell the story of the final battle in the war between the Klingon Empire and the Federation—set roughly twenty years before Captain Kirk takes command of the Enterprise, the film pits a new Klingon character, Commander Kharn (not Khan), against the leading Federation commander, Garth of Izar.
The final film is set to be released next year, but Prelude to Axanar—a History Channel-style documentary that features Commander Kharn and Captain Garth of Izar looking back at the epic battle—will premiere Saturday in San Diego during Comic-Con International, screened as part of a Q&A with stars Richard Hatch and Gary Graham as well as producer/creator Alec Peters and director Christian Gossett.
"We're in a time period where there isn't any Star Trek on TV, and people are looking for opportunities," says Peters, who also plays Garth of Izar in the movie. While the current blockbuster films have introduced the characters and Star Trek universe to a new audience, purists are still waiting for hardcore Trek content. "For a lot of Star Trek fans, the J.J. Abrams films are not the Star Trek they grew up with," says Peters.
Axanar, which Peters began writing in 2010, is just the latest in a long line of Star Trek fan productions. Paramount, which owns the franchise, has traditionally allowed these fan-made projects to move forward, as long as they agree not to sell anything—including tickets, merchandise, or copies of the finished film or series. With sales prohibited, funding had always been a limitation for movies like Axanar, but Kickstarter offered a new way to raise a sizable budget. Axanar met its funding goal ten times over, raising more than $100,000—more than enough for Peters to make a studio-quality sizzle reel. Peters hopes Prelude to Axanar will fuel the next round of funding, helping the production reach its target budget of $250,000 for the full feature.
Peters has taken an unlikely path toward producing what he calls this "independent Star Trek film." A University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill law school grad who passed the North Carolina bar, "film producer" is his fourth or fifth career: he's also coached volleyball at the University of Southern California, started multiple tech companies, and in 2008 created Propworx—a company that acquires and sells items used in major studio productions.
Through Propworx and attending sci-fi and comic conventions, Peters, long a part of Star Trek's passionate fanbase, connected with people who were producing some of the fan films and series. In Axanar, he will be reprising the role of Garth of Izar, having previously played the character in the fan series Star Trek New Voyages: Phase II.
Peters also found an ideal collaborator in director Gossett, who had worked on films ranging from romantic comedies to zombie flicks. "It began when I was seventeen or so doing any old art department work around Los Angeles," says Gossett. "Crazy stuff—lots of studios just making movies in the middle of the night. Very, very unregulated, very non-union little shoots."
In the 1990s, Gossett was hired by Dark Horse Comics and Lucasfilm Licensing to design art for stories set in the Star Wars universe. The Star Wars prequels were in development, and George Lucas "didn't want new stories that would tie his hands. So he said, 'Any new stuff, I want it 4,000 years before Luke Skywalker.' That was deemed safe."
The gig gave Gossett reason to set about learning how Lucas had put together the Star Wars universe, and he jumped at the chance to do similar work in Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek world.
The challenge was to "work backward from an alternate future," Gossett says. "If Star Trek was 1966's view of the future, what does 1946's view of the future look like?"
Set in the Star Trek World
Although set before the Captain Kirk era, there will be many familiar elements of Roddenberry's world in Axanar. Garth of Izar, for example, will be familiar to fans of the original Star Trek series as the center of a standout Season 3 episode titled "Whom Gods Destroy." The episode encapsulates the mix of elements that made Star Trek such a beloved and influential show. Kirk, working at his wily best, struggles to get himself and his crew out of a sticky situation. He encounters a green-skinned spacewoman who attempts to seduce him, and the situation is resolved through a combination of wits, battle, and the professionalism of his crew.
In the background of this matinee-worthy story are heavy subjects and themes like mental illness, the lasting scars of war, and the impossibility—even centuries in the future—of creating a perfect society. And along the way, audiences encounter some lines from Shakespeare, while the title of the episode itself references a Longfellow poem.
It's the same balance of weighty subject matter and entertainment that the Axanar team wants to deliver with their film. According to Richard Hatch, who plays Commander Kharn in the movie (and whom audiences are most likely to know from his turn as Tom Zarek on Battlestar Galactica), it's what makes fans so committed to their favorite franchises. Audiences want "fun and humor, but love to have shows that honestly explore those powerful questions most people will ask at some point," Hatch says. "Nothing does that better than great science fiction and fantasy."
Hatch makes a distinction between "true sci-fi" and productions that offer only a "sci-fi veneer." "You don't really bond fans to something superficial or trivial," he says. He was drawn to the production on the strength of a script he believes continues in the tradition of complex characters and moral situations established by series like Babylon 5 and Battlestar Galactica. He's not alone. Hatch is joined in the Axanar cast by fellow BSG star Kate Vernon. Also on board is Tony Todd, veteran of three different Star Trek series and dozens of sci-fi productions. And, ultimately, their work—Star Trek: Axanar included—is part of a long tradition.
"The story structure of sci-fi touches people on a deep level," Hatch says. "It's a genre that deals with theoretical possibilities that many of us are facing today and in the future. It's concerned with where we came from, where we're going."

Brighton are set to land Joe Gomez on a season-long loan from Liverpool.
Seagulls boss Chris Hughton is poised to continue his preparations for Brighton's first ever Premier League campaign by beating Celtic to the Reds defender.
Joining Brighton will give versatile defender Gomez the chance to kickstart his career with regular football after his serious knee injury.
The 20 year-old made an impressive start to his Liverpool career after making a £3.5m move to Anfield from Charlton in June 2015.
But just a few months into his Liverpool career Gomez suffered a cruciate ligament injury that kept him out for over a year.

Gomez returned last season but made just three FA Cup appearances and last played in January.
He will become Brighton's fourth summer addition so far following the arrivals of goalkeeper Maty Ryan, defender Josh Kerr and midfielder Pascal Gross.
To date, Google has kept its lineup of Nexus phones and tablets pretty simple. There's a phone, a small tablet, and a big tablet. Only one device in each category is offered for sale at any given time. The wider Android ecosystem is more diverse than that, though, and the operating system's biggest power users demand more choices. Different form factors, bigger screens, and SD card slots are all common requests. The problem is that non-Nexus devices that support these features lack the clean, "stock" Android of the Nexus lineup, and they rarely get prompt operating system updates.
Body, build quality, and screen: More good news than bad
Specs at a glance: LG G Pad 8.3, Google Play edition Screen 1920×1200 8.3" (273 PPI) IPS LCD OS Android 4.4 KitKat CPU Quad-core 1.7GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 RAM 2GB GPU Qualcomm Adreno 320 Storage 16GB, upgradeable via up to 64GB microSD Networking 802.11a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 Ports Micro-USB, headphones, microSD Camera 5MP rear camera, 1.3MP front camera Size 8.54" × 4.98" × 0.33" (216.8 x 126.5 x 8.3 mm) Weight 11.9 oz. (338 g) Battery 4600 mAh Starting price $349
Enter the Google Play edition (GPe) program, which lets these people have their cake and eat it too. While the Google Play edition gadgets lack the wallet-friendly pricing of the Nexuses, they run a Google-style version of Android bereft of skins and bloatware, and they get updates much faster than they otherwise would. GPe devices got Android 4.3 just eight days after it rolled out to the Nexuses, and they got 4.4 about two weeks after it came to older Nexus hardware. Even more importantly, the Google Play edition hardware can fill niches that the Nexus doesn't serve: the 6.4-inch Sony Z Ultra is the "Nexus" that "phablet" fans have always wanted, and LG's G Pad 8.3 is a tablet that slots almost exactly in between the great-but-smaller Nexus 7 and the large-and-aging Nexus 10 . We never took a look at the standard G Pad, so we'll be giving the Google Play edition the full hardware and software review treatment.
The so-called "Nexus 8" that set the rumor mill a-buzzing ended up being nothing but a bad Photoshop job, but if the prospect of an 8-inch Nexus got you excited, the G Pad is a nice consolation prize.
The all-black tablet uses plastic around the sides and on the top and bottom, but most of the back is made of a black brushed metal that looks and feels nice even though it's a fingerprint magnet. It's not as stiff or rigid as the aluminum Apple uses in the Retina iPad mini or the iPad Air, but it makes the tablet feel sturdy. We like the all-plastic construction of the 2013 Nexus 7, but if you like metal more, the G Pad delivers.
The tablet is closer in size to a Retina iPad mini than a Nexus 7, though the different screen aspect ratios (16:10 in the G Pad, 4:3 in the iPad) means there are still differences. The G Pad is narrower than the iPad—narrow enough that palming it is possible with some effort if you have medium-sized or large hands—but it's a little taller. The two are virtually identical in weight, and though the iPad is thinner, the difference is less than a millimeter.
The G Pad's display bezels are also more iPad-like—the device lacks the large top and bottom bezels of the 2013 Nexus 7 and its side bezels are even thinner. This can actually cause some usability problems—while the iPad mini and iOS are great at detecting and ignoring a thumb pressed down on the edge of the display, the G Pad had a harder time. Some apps seemed a little better at ignoring extraneous input than others. Chrome behaved pretty well when I had about a third of my thumb touching the display, while the Kindle app was less well-behaved. Your experience may differ from ours based on what apps you use. The issues are avoidable if you're careful about where you place your thumb, but on the iPad you don't really have to worry about this stuff.
Aside from the different dimensions, the G Pad does have a couple of features that the Nexus 7 and iPad mini lack. It has a vibration motor that will let you know when new notifications come in (and provides haptic feedback for the keyboard and other things). Like some of LG's other efforts (the Nexus 4 and Nexus 5), it doesn't have the satisfying buzz of an iPhone or Moto X, but it is nevertheless an appreciated addition. There's also a microSD card slot tucked away beneath a plastic door on the top of the tablet—more on that in a minute. There's no notification light, however.
The screen uses the same 1920×1200 display resolution as the 2013 Nexus 7, which at 8.3 inches gives it a lower-but-still-crisp density of 273 PPI. It's not as sharp as either the Nexus or the Retina iPad mini, but it's pretty close to the 264 PPI iPad Air. Text and high-PPI-optimized images are all crisp and clear, and you won't really miss the drop in density from the Nexus.
More noticeable is the drop in brightness. Whites are less white on the G Pad than they are on the Nexus 7, and while blacks are blacker, the distinction between gray and black is much less pronounced. I generally find that auto-brightness on Android phones and tablets is a little too aggressive, making the screens look dimmer than on equivalent iOS devices, but the G Pad made me even more eager to disable auto-brightness and crank the setting up to maximum.
Camera and sound
The G Pad includes a pair of speakers mounted on the back (they're on the right side if you're looking at the back of the tablet, the left side if you're looking at the front). The positioning is preferable to the edge-mounted speakers on the Nexus or the iPad since they're less likely to get muffled by your hands (in landscape mode) or a surface you're resting the tablet on (in portrait mode). However, the speakers aren't very good—their sound is muffled and a little hissy, and the problem is especially pronounced at lower volumes. For example, it's hard to pick hi-hat sounds out of a song unless you have the speakers up around 50 percent. Bring your headphones.
The 5MP rear camera is similarly perfunctory, but it's joined in its mediocrity by most other tablets. Even though most manufacturers include a rear camera on their tablets now, even Apple doesn't seem particularly interested in pushing the quality envelope. A quick test of the camera indoors shows that it can do better than the Nexus 7, but it's far from perfect.
Mayor of London calls for children at risk to be removed from families and taken into care
Muslim children at risk of radicalisation at the hands of their parents are victims of child abuse and should be taken into care, Boris Johnson has said.
The Mayor of London called for children at risk from extremism to be removed from their families to stop them being turned into "potential killers or suicide bombers".
Johnson said "fatal squeamishness" had developed over intervening in the behaviour of certain groups in society but insisted there was a need to be "stronger and clearer in asserting our understanding of British values".
Some children are being "taught crazy stuff" in the vein of the vile beliefs of soldier Lee Rigby's killers Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, he added.
In his weekly column for the Daily Telegraph he said: "We know that the problem of radicalisation is not getting conspicuously worse – but nor is it going away. There are a few thousand people in London – the "low thousands", they say – who are of interest to the security services; and a huge amount of work goes into monitoring those people, and into making sure that their ranks are not swelled by new victims of radicalisation.
"What has been less widely understood is that some young people are now being radicalised at home, by their parents or by their step-parents. It is estimated that there could be hundreds of children – especially those who come within the orbit of the banned extremist group al-Muhajiroun – who are being taught crazy stuff: the kind of mad yearning for murder and death that we heard from Lee Rigby's killers.
"At present, there is a reluctance by the social services to intervene, even when they and the police have clear evidence of what is going on, because it is not clear that the 'safeguarding law' would support such action.
"A child may be taken into care if he or she is being exposed to pornography, or is being abused – but not if the child is being habituated to this utterly bleak and nihilistic view of the world that could lead them to become murderers
"I have been told of at least one case where the younger siblings of a convicted terrorist are well on the road to radicalisation – and it is simply not clear that the law would support intervention.
"This is absurd. The law should obviously treat radicalisation as a form of child abuse. It is the strong view of many of those involved in counter-terrorism that there should be a clearer legal position, so that those children who are being turned into potential killers or suicide bombers can be removed into care – for their own safety and for the safety of the public.
"That must surely be right. We need to be less phobic of intrusion into the ways of minority groups and less nervous of passing judgment on other cultures. We can have a great, glorious, polychromatic society, but we must be firm to the point of ruthlessness in opposing behaviour that undermines our values.
"Paedophilia, FGM, Islamic radicalisation – to some extent, at some stage, we have tiptoed round them all for fear of offending this or that minority. It is children who have suffered."
Johnson branded Islamic extremism as an "awful virus" but suggested political correctness was hampering attempts to stop it spreading.
He added: "It must have been dreadful for the family of Drummer Lee Rigby to listen to the ravings of his killers as they were finally hauled away to the cells and, one hopes, to a lifetime of incarceration.
"If those relatives have one consolation, it is that they were just about the last words those men will ever pronounce in public; the last time we will have to hear them pervert the religion of Islam – and the most important question now is how we prevent other young men, and women, from succumbing to that awful virus: the contagion of radical Islamic extremism.
"Every day in London and other big cities, there are thousands of counter-terrorism officers doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe. They have to work out who are the most vulnerable young people, who are the most susceptible - and they have to stop the infection of radicalisation before it is too late.
"That will sometimes mean taking a view about what is happening to them in their homes and families – and I worry that their work is being hampered by what I am obliged to call political correctness."
Everton will complete the signing of Ramiro Funes Mori after the defender finally received a work permit, according to the Mirror.
Everton were worried that the Argentinian wouldn't receive clearance to play as he hasn't seen much international recognition for his national side.
But with the revamped work permit rules, the Goodison Park hierarchy made a convincing case for Mori to ply his trade in England.
Everton's interest in the 24-year-old had been known for quite some time and the fee between the Blues and River Plate had been agreed for almost a fortnight.
And now all the relevant paperwork has been finalised, the £6million move can finally be completed.
Funes Mori recently won the Copa Libertadores with River Plate and has been finding his feet on the international scene.
Roberto Martinez wants to do more business before the 6pm deadline and has reopened talks with Spurs for Aaron Lennon but the two clubs are still far apart in their valuation of the player.
Shakhtar Donetsk's Bernard and Roma winger Juan Iturbe are also on Martinez's radar, with the Catalonian desperate to bolster his attacking options.
Several thousand people took to the streets of Caracas and other Venezuelan cities to protest against education reform plans and restrictions on the right to demonstrate.
Saturday's marches were the latest in a spate of at times violent anti-government unrest that erupted in February and has claimed at least 41 lives.
The education ministry recently started consultations to reform the country's basic school curriculum in a move opponents say is aimed at "indoctrinating" students with socialist rhetoric promoted by late longtime leader Hugo Chavez and his political heir and successor, current President Nicolas Maduro.
An estimated 3,000 mostly young marchers turned out in the capital Caracas, initially gathering near a university.
Some demonstrators carried signs that read "education is not indoctrination" and "fight for education that teaches us to think and not obey."
Others criticised recent restrictions on protests with banners such as "protesting is my right".
On Thursday, the Supreme Court issued a ruling requiring demonstrations be approved ahead of time by authorities or risk being dispersed, in order "to guarantee the right to free movement".
Opponents say the ruling goes against democratic principles.
Similar protests took place in other cities around the country, including Valencia and Maracaibo.
Anti-government unrest has rattled Venezuela since February, leaving at least 41 people dead and more than 700 injured as angry students and others denounce rampant crime, inflation, widespread shortages of basic goods and other economic woes.
The demonstrations have died down recently but continued sporadically in pockets of eastern Caracas, which tends to be well off and anti-Maduro.
Maduro was narrowly elected to succeed Chavez last year after he died of cancer.
President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that Linda McMahon, wife of World Wrestling Entertainment founder Vince McMahon, is his nominee to head the Small Business Administration.
"Linda has a tremendous background and is widely recognized as one of the country's top female executives advising businesses around the globe. She helped grow WWE from a modest 13-person operation to a publicly traded global enterprise with more than 800 employees in offices worldwide. Linda is going to be a phenomenal leader and champion for small businesses and unleash America's entrepreneurial spirit all across the country," Trump said.
"Our small businesses are the largest source of job creation in our country," McMahon said. "I am honored to join the incredibly impressive economic team that President-elect Trump has assembled to ensure that we promote our country's small businesses and help them grow and thrive."
She has long had an interest in politics, having run for the Senate in her home state of Connecticut in 2010 and 2012, but fell short despite spending millions of her own money in each effort. She has remained active in Republican politics, co-hosting fundraising committees for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's Leadership Matters for America PAC. She and her husband rank 20th on the Center for Responsive Politics' "top outside donors" list for 2016, having given $8.6 million to conservative groups in the last election cycle and another $1 million to candidates and parties.
House Small Business Committee Chairman Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, called McMahon an "excellent pick" and said he would work with her and the new administration "to roll back burdensome regulations and increase access to capital for America's 28 million small businesses."
Trump has been an occasional participant in some of the WWE's Wrestlemania events. In 2007, Trump "tackled" Vince McMahon, forcing the wrestling mogul to get his head shaved by Trump.
Long before tapes of Trump boasting about groping entered the picture, the Guardian took Jill Harth and others seriously. Help us continue in-depth reporting on these serious issues
When I first called Jill Harth back in the spring, she didn't want to talk. Neither did a number of the other women I called who had crossed paths with Donald Trump. But few of them had documented their encounters as thoroughly as Harth, whose 1997 lawsuit alleging attempted rape against Trump is a matter of public record.
Harth had kept quiet for almost 20 years. But a few months after my call, her lawyer got in touch. The impetus, as Harth put it in an emotional hour-long interview at the Guardian's New York office in July, was Trump's repeated insistence that any woman alleging misbehavior on his part was lying.
Trump is still calling Harth and many others liars, even as the number of women accusing him of sexual misconduct has risen into the double digits.
Long before crass tapes of Trump boasting about sexual groping entered the picture – and Harth's story suddenly became front-page news – the Guardian was the rare publication that took Harth's story seriously. We were the first to publish her account last July, even as other outlets dismissed stories like it as too frivolous or implausible. We also published the accounts of fat-shamed beauty queen Alicia Machado and legally bullied Sheena Monnin, well before Trump's mistreatment of women became the defining story of the presidential election.
Harth, who charged Trump with sexually assaulting her in one of his children's bedrooms at his Mar-a-Lago estate in 1993, didn't come to the Guardian by chance. She came to me because she knew the Guardian was committed to telling her story; and she sensed I had the time, flexibility and resources I needed to tell it.
She was right. When Trump clinched the nomination last spring, my editors asked me to dig deeply into Trump's long history of misogyny, and gave me the support I needed to do so.
But the Guardian's commitment to this kind of in-depth reporting is time consuming and expensive. That's why I'm writing to ask for your support by making a contribution or becoming a member.
The business model for investigative journalism is broken. As comedian John Oliver explained recently in this brilliant segment, nobody in journalism has figured out a sustainable formula for making money on the internet. Online ads generate a tiny fraction of the revenue that print ads once did – and news publications like the Guardian are competing with tech giants Google and Facebook for digital advertising revenue.
From Bill Cosby to Roger Ailes to Donald Trump, this election year may go down as the moment our country finally started taking sexual assault seriously. These stories found an audience because of the brave women who told them, but also because of the journalists and the editors who listened first. We did that at the Guardian, and now we hope you'll listen back.
Please support independent journalism at the Guardian by making a contribution or becoming a member today.
Roaring: Among big cat fans the roar is the ultimate form of communication. Only the great cats can roar; that is, the tiger, lion, jaguar and leopard -- but not the snow leopard. The ability to roar is what differentiates a 'great' cat from a 'big' cat. In great cats the structure of bones supporting the larynx, and anchoring the throat and tongue, (called the hyoid) is connected with an elastic ligament as against more bone. This can be stretched by up to a third (eight or nine inches), so opening the air passages and allowing the roar to be produced. Though the snow leopard has this modification it is in a somewhat primitive form and that cat has never been recorded as roaring. Utilised in long-range communication the roar is infrequently used. Easily heard for over 3 km, it advertises location and warns away other tigers, or attracts them when the search for a mate is on. Sometimes it is sounded after a successful kill, but never during the actual attack which is carried out in silence. Lions may be extended their roaring so it continues for one or two minutes; this encourages members of the pride to join in. The roar of the solitary tiger is usually very short in duration. Mating is when roaring is heard most often; tigers are at their noisiest when on heat and breeding. During a roar the ears are laid back and rotated so the backs are visible, the nose wrinkles and the eyes narrow. Moans: Roars may be preceded with a long, low moaning noise. Softer versions of the moan are used in communication between mother and cubs. Growls and Snarls: Growls and snarls are easily the most common form of communication, with the growl being aggressive, while the snarl is defensive. The tigers shown on this page and the next are both snarling.
Growls can turn into a hissing or spitting very similar to that produced by a domestic cat. Purring: This is something of a dilemma. Some people claim to have heard it in the tiger, but many experts feel it is almost certain that tigers do not, and cannot purr in the same way that the small cats can. Chuffing or Prusten: The 'chuff' or 'prusten' is considered to be a friendly and non-threatening alternative to purring. In German, prusten means to sneeze, snort, or suddenly burst out laughing. This low-intensity sound is produced by holding the mouth closed and snorting through the nostrils. In the wild prusten is used when two tigers meet on neutral territory, while captive tigers sometimes start to use it with keepers. Pook: Another unusual sound which may be made is the 'pook'. This is very similar to the sound made by the sambar, a favourite prey animal of the tiger. Because of this fact some experts think it may be a form of mimicry. By imitating the deer the tiger could elicit a reply, so locating the precise whereabouts of lunch. Local hunters also believe that the Amur (Siberian) tiger imitates the wapiti deer by producing the roaring of a stag during mating season. These ideas are still to be proven and those who disagree point out it is equally likely any attempt at mimicry could spook the prey. Other sounds: The tiger's range of sound is quite wide and they also meow, grunt and make a type of woofing noise.

LONDON (Reuters) - Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi met Britain's Queen Elizabeth for lunch on Friday at Buckingham Palace.
Nobel laureate Suu Kyi - who serves as Myanmar's foreign minister while also being de facto head of its civilian government - later met Prince Charles, heir to the throne, and his wife Camilla.
Prince William, Charles's elder son, attended the queen's lunch with Suu Kyi, the palace said.
Suu Kyi, who took power in April 2016 as part of a transition from military rule, has denied ethnic cleansing in the Muslim-majority Rakhine region.
Attacks on Myanmar border guard posts in October last year by a previously unknown insurgent group ignited the biggest crisis so far for Suu Kyi, with more than 75,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh in the ensuing army crackdown.

Ritz founded the nonprofit Green Bronx Machine, planting community gardens all over the Bronx.
Though he's often at school six days a week, he's paid for just one. He says it's his wife who makes ends meet.

Ritz teaches science in the nation's poorest congressional district, at Community School 55 in the South Bronx.
The neighborhood is a food desert, where Ritz says it's easier to buy liquor than lettuce. He calls the food options a M.E.S.S. — "a manufactured, edible synthetic substance that comes in a Ziploc, hermetically sealed bag with infinite shelf life."
Ritz's goal: send students home with 100 bags of fresh, school-grown fruits and vegetables a week, 50 weeks a year.
In the afternoon, Ritz hosts a fourth-grade cooking class. On the menu: vegetarian chili.

Jeffrey Haywood (far left) brings his grandson, Cori (far right), a third-grader. Haywood says he can't believe what Ritz is trying to do here. When he was a kid, Haywood says, "we had no plants growing in no schools. If anything, we are trying to get into the schools."
Ritz got his green thumb many years ago while teaching at a Bronx high school. Someone sent him a box of daffodil bulbs. Not knowing what to do with them, he stashed them behind a radiator.

A few weeks later, a fight broke out. Ritz says one student ran to the radiator because, he assumed, the boy had hidden a weapon there. Instead, he found "hundreds of flowers busting out of this box. And the kid, instead of coming out to beat someone's behind, came out with a box of flowers. The class burst out laughing."
Ritz says he had an epiphany. He and his students went on to plant some 20,000 bulbs across New York that year.
The lesson, Ritz says, is that a seed well-planted can grow into something beautiful anywhere.
Three days of mourning declared in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as rebel forces kill 36, government says
At least 36 people have been killed in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, the government said on Sunday, calling it a massacre in revenge for military operations in the area.
Three days of national mourning have been declared following Saturday night's mass killing, the latest in a series of massacres that have left more than 600 people dead in and around the troubled town of Beni since 2014.
Army spokesman Mak Hazukay said the attack was carried out by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a partly Islamist armed group of Ugandan origin. The group has been present in DRC for more than two decades and is accused of copious human rights abuses.
Hazukay said the ADF rebels had bypassed army positions “to come and massacre the population in revenge” for military operations in the area. The victims – 22 men and 14 women, according to government spokesman Lambert Mende – were found in Rwangoma, a neighbourhood on the outskirts of Beni.
Mende said the government has previously sought to “alert the world to the jihadist threat” in DRC, adding: “In our country, the armed forces of the DRC are alone in the face of the indifference of the international community.”
Around 100 angry residents gathered in Beni to protest against the mass killing, carrying the body of one of the victims and shouting slogans against President Joseph Kabila, witnesses said. Local human rights activist Jackson Kasereka said residents in north Beni were burning tyres in the streets.
“The police have just taken the body off us but we will continue to protest. It's not normal that they slaughter us like goats,” said one demonstrator, Georges Kamate, a motorcycle taxi driver.
“Our government is incapable of keeping us safe,” shouted another protester.
The killings came three days after Kabila visited the region, promising to do everything in his power to bring peace and security.
“It's worrying because the president of the republic came here and then we were massacred,” said Gilbert Kambale, a local civil society leader, adding that the attack took place between 7pm and 11pm on Saturday. He said there was a lot of anger over the government's apparent inability to restore security to the area.
“There is a blatant lack of security, [the authorities] are not capable of keeping the population safe. That is why these people have come into the street.”
Contacted by AFP, the mayor of Beni, Edmond Masumbuko, had no immediate comment, saying he was tied up “in a security meeting”.
The three days of national mourning would begin on Monday, Mende said, “Flags will be lowered to half-mast across the country and media scheduling will be adjusted to the situation.”
Beni lies on the edge of the vast Virunga national park, used as a hideout for some of the dozens of militant groups active in North Kivu.
The area has been badly hit by violence over the past two years, suffering a series of massacres which the Congolese government and the UN's mission in DRC, Monusco, have blamed on the ADF.
But in March, that allegation was questioned in a report published by the Congo Research Group at New York University, which looked into the massacres around Beni, and claimed that soldiers from the regular army had also participated in the killings.
The government rejected the claims and said the ADF was definitely responsible for the massacres.
The ADF, opposed to Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni, is thought to be deeply embroiled in criminal networks funded by kidnappings, smuggling and logging.
Despite efforts by the international community and the Congolese authorities, the region has remained mired in violence since the end of the second Congolese war (1998-2003).
On 8 August, 11 Congolese soldiers and a UN peacekeeper were wounded in the Beni area during a confrontation with ADF forces, Monusco said.
BEIRUT – The alleged Tripoli-based Al-Qaeda militant who swore allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham in an audio tape released Saturday is a Lebanese national who was one of the main officials in the Fatah al-Islam organization that fought the Lebanese army in the Nahr al-Bared Palestinian camp in 2007, Al-Akhbar newspaper reported Monday.
Abou Sayyaf al-Ansari announced in his recording that radicals in Lebanon had pledged to “recruit units in Lebanon in order to continue the path of Jihad” for ISIS, adding that the official spokesperson for the “Islamic State of Lebanon,” Abou Omar al-Mouhajer, will issue a statement in the coming few days.
A source told Al-Akhbar that Mouhajer was coordinating and preparing for terrorist attacks in Lebanon on behalf of ISIS.
The source also said that the voice recording issued by Ansari had not been recorded in the Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp in Sidon.
Preparations for the voice recording began two months ago, another source told the pro-Hezbollah daily, adding that members from ISIS in Syria coordinated between the different radical Sunni cells allied with ISIS in Lebanon.
The Al-Qaeda-linked Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham claimed responsibility for the January 2 suicide bombing in Beirut's southern suburb of Dahiyeh that killed four people.
It is also facing a rebel backlash in Syria after being accused of a string of abuses against civilians and rival rebel groups.
Meanwhile, in a statement issued earlier on Saturday, Future Movement leader MP Saad Hariri warned the Lebanese, especially Sunnis, against “suspicious calls” which will lead to wars, in a reference to recruitment appeals issued by Al-Qaeda-linked groups in Lebanon.
“The Lebanese people and Sunnis refuse to be part of any war in Lebanon or the region between Hezbollah and Al-Qaeda... They also refuse that civilians in any area in Lebanon become a target for this insane war and its dangerous repercussions on national and Islamic unity.”
Hariri's comments came a day after Al-Nusra Front in Lebanon warned Sunnis to stay away from Hezbollah-controlled areas and called them to join the organization's campaign against the Shiite party.

ENGLEWOOD, Colo. — As he swung on a black puffy coat following the Denver Broncos' final practice in Colorado prior to Super Bowl 50, Von Miller said the words that strike fear into football reporters across the country.
“Maybe I'll say, ‘I'm just here so I won't get fined?' " said Miller, channeling tight-lipped Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch.
Miller tried to keep a straight face, but within seconds he was cracking up — that booming, gravelly laugh that might be the most common sound in the defensive side of the Broncos locker room.
An effervescent outside linebacker, Miller will be the Super Bowl's antithesis of Lynch, whose curt media sessions and general lack of accessability provided a sideshow the last two years.
The Carolina Panthers may have their share of big personalities, from quarterback Cam Newton and his flashy pants to cornerback Josh Norman and his brash talking. But Miller is poised to be the breakout star of the week.
He's been shining on the field for five seasons as a two-time all-pro with 60 career sacks and is rapidly becoming one of the Broncos' most beloved players because of his ferocious pass rush and infectious personality.
But unlike some of the other top players from Miller's his 2011 draft class — namely Newton, the No. 1 pick, and Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt — he has yet to parlay that success into mainstream off-field stardom. And Miller is one of only two non-quarterbacks from the top 11 picks in that class who has yet to receive a contract extension.
A memorable week leading up to the Super Bowl — and then an even bigger game Sunday against Newton and the Panthers — could change all that.
“I need to get me some chicken commercials. Happy Chickens,” Miller laughed as he described his dream commercial chicken farm, one complete with live webcams, so everyone could see that his poultry was raised humanely, and a sound system.
“Pump in a little Sade,” Miller said.
Surely slow jams weren't on the curriculum of Miller's poultry science courses at Texas A&M. But if his approach to raising poultry is anywhere near his formula for bagging quarterbacks, it's hard to argue with his methodology.
Miller is the best player on the NFL's best defense because of his combination of speed, flexibility and an increasingly complex arsenal of moves. Paired with veteran pass rusher DeMarcus Ware in coordinator Wade Phillips' aggressive defense, Miller dipped, spun and bullrushed his way to 11 of the Broncos' league-high 52 sacks.
His performance in the AFC Championship Game against the New England Patriots showed why he could soon earn one of the richest defensive contracts in the NFL. He sacked Tom Brady 2½ times, racked up seven tackles and showed his versatility by dropping back to cover tight end Rob Gronkowski before intercepting Brady.
“They try to put me in a pass rush category, but I try to have A-plus on everything I do — whether it's pass coverage, off the field stuff, working with rookies, everything I do — not just pass rush. And I think that's what makes me different,” Miller told USA TODAY Sports.
“On third downs, I might be rushing, but I might be in coverage, too. It's a legitimate 50-50 chance that I'll be doing either one.”
The Miller the world will see this week — he might be dancing at Monday's media day, likely donning a Texas-sized Cowboy hat and surely talking about his future in chicken farming — is far different from the version the Broncos saw two years ago, when a six-game, drug-related suspension and torn anterior cruciate ligament threatened to derail his promising career.
“I wouldn't even call it low. It was just rough. If it had been a low point, I would have just been like, (screw) it. I'm done,” Miller said.
But he served out his suspension, leaning on his parents — they temporarily moved in with him — and veteran teammates like former Broncos Champ Bailey and Terrance Knighton. Miller was determined to reclaim (or exceed) the form that helped him notch 30 sacks in his first two seasons. It didn't happen immediately, in part because his experiment of adding more than 15 pounds of muscle, mostly to his upper body, failed. He tore his ACL in Week 15 of the 2013 season, which he finished with just five sacks in nine games before watching his teammates lose to the Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII.
Those off-field concerns and injury questions feel like ages ago now. Miller, while still a goofball, has matured. He's out of the NFL's drug program thanks to two years of clean tests. And while he still leans on Ware for guidance, he's become a locker room leader thanks to his practice habits. Miller missed just one practice all season when he had a bad reaction to some movie theater mozzarella sticks in January.
“I just think he had a tremendous amount of support — not just from us, but in his personal life, from his mom and dad. His agent's done a tremendous job getting him in the right situation and around the right people,” Broncos general manager John Elway told USA TODAY Sports. “But the bottom line is, you can have all the support and everything you could want, (but) unless you make your mind up that's that what you want to do, it'll never happen.
"Really all the credit goes to Von, because he made his mind up what he wanted to be. ... It's been a tremendous maturation process for him, and we're thrilled that he's come through.”

Property owner hopes to turn explosion site into the ‘living room of Greenwood'
The property owner of the site of the devastating March 9 natural gas explosion in downtown Greenwood says his company is planning to rebuild the site into “the living room of Greenwood.”
The blast destroyed Mr. Gyros, Neptune Coffee and Greenwood Quick Stop, and damaged another 50 surrounding businesses.
“We are 100 percent committed to rebuilding Greenwood,” Mike Slattery of Slattery Properties said at tonight's Greenwood Community Council meeting.
With insurance dragging its feet, Slattery said his company is moving ahead anyway and has hired an architectural design firm to begin designing a mixed-use building that will cover the west side of Greenwood Avenue North between 84th street and the soon-to-open Flint Creek Cattle Co. restaurant on the corner of 85th (the restaurant plans to finally open Oct. 1.) The building that housed Better Hearing, Kouzina and Insurrection Apparel and Boots will be demolished.
Slattery said that before the explosion, his company planned to restore buildings on that block to look like Greenwood in the 1930s, taking cues from the Flint Creek building. They had done some work on roofs and windows, and were very excited to have Flint Creek sign a lease to turn the former antique store into an upscale restaurant.
Then came March 9.
“When you see your son calling at 3:30 in the morning, it ain't good,” Slattery said. “He said the place is kindling and in pieces.”
It's now been more than six months of cleaning up and dealing with insurance companies. With this morning's Washington State Utilities and Transportation Commission report that places blame for the explosion on Puget Sound Energy for failing to properly decommission a gas line attached to Mr. Gyros that was later damaged by transients, Slattery hopes the insurance money will start flowing.
“With the partial finger pointing to PSE, it strengthens our case,” he said.
Slattery said the plan now is for two levels of underground parking, ground floor retail of seven or eight small businesses, then apartments on top. He said the company will offer retail space to all seven businesses that were destroyed or displaced. (G&O Family Cyclery, which was next to Neptune Coffee, suffered extensive damage and has temporarily moved a block north.)
“We're looking to do something that blends with the neighborhood, that will be a first-class project,” he said. “We're hoping to make that retail presence the living room of Greenwood.”
He said the retail spaces will likely range from 600 to 1,200 square feet. He wants small, local businesses in there, not national chains, with outdoor seating, a green roof, and “having a belly full of PSE, we want to put as many solar panels on the roof as possible.”
The community will have opportunities to comment on the project once design gets officially underway.
Update Wednesday: Slattery Properties has applied for a permit with Seattle Department of Construction & Inspections to construct a 91,400 square foot building with 75 apartments, ground floor retail, and 70 parking spaces. The project will be subject to Early Design Guidance meetings (open to the public) and environmental review.

Sophie Walker of the Women's Equality Party has decided to stand against Tory MP Philip Davies in Shipley in Yorkshire. The WEP can gain publicity from this ruse. Davies is despised by the Left for refusing to engage in their virtue-signalling. By taking him on they hope to increase their own support.
Their strategy is in danger of backfiring. The left wing has formed a coalition ‘The Progressive Alliance' with the idea that they will stand aside for each other to strengthen the anti-Tory vote. By providing an alternative to the Labour Party, Shipley's indigenous feminists, the Shipley Feminist Zealots, feel that the WEP is behaving inconsiderately. The WEP may gain publicity, but it will split Shipley's left wing vote.
But taking a stand against Philip Davies is a priority. He is a member of the House of Commons Women and Equalities Committee but is guided by his constituents rather than by feminist ideology. He also received a great deal of public support when he suggested removing the ‘women' word.
His investigation into custodial sentencing showed an alarming (to the feminists) attention to fact and detail. Sophie Walker by contrast does not allow herself to be fettered by the truth.
He prioritised justice rather than virtue-signalling by supporting Baroness Cox's Bill which aimed to ensure Muslim women had the protection of the British law by banning Sharia Courts.
He rejected the Istanbul Convention. It ignored two thirds of the victims of violence – simply because they are men.
He has an old fashioned idea of gender equality. The laws should be gender neutral and everybody should be treated the same:
“…all these laws should be gender neutral. It doesn't matter whether the victim is a man or a woman. It doesn't matter whether the perpetrator is a man or a woman. Everybody should be treated the same.”
The WEP don't like Mr Davies – or any other man – getting involved in gender equality. He has shown in his attention to the details of custodial sentencing and domestic violence that he takes the concept seriously. The WEP like to keep the meaning of those concepts obscure. Sophie Walker has said that they ‘own' equality. However it is clear that does not mean equality under the law.
“Equality under the law is mistaken for equality” (Catherine Mayer – founder)
It appears to be handy to exercise latitude around its definition; it means they can ask for more and more:
“I don't know what enough equality looks like but my answer always is ‘no we don't have enough'”
Sophie Walker goes on to explain if others should implement their policies they will simply raise the bar.
This greedy approach to a spurious equality suggests entitlement and privilege. We see from what Sophie tells us that it was the first wave of feminist thinking which sowed these poisonous seeds:
“I was told as a girl growing up that I could have everything, but I couldn't”.
Contemporary feminists were brought up to have expectations that the rest of us mere mortals would never dream of. Expectations which would be a burden to the bearer, costly to others, and impossible to fulfil.
These are the expectations that drive feminist thinking: to want more money, more status, more power. And they achieve these things with the help of well-paid husbands (Sophie's is the Chief Executive of Barking and Dagenham Council) who, while helping to fund their lifestyles, remain firmly behind the scenes.
Meanwhile, their feminist policies breed single parenthood by ignoring men's family importance and the education and employment of working class men.
Wanting everything is destructive, particularly when we feel entitled to all our goals. Most of us understand our demands can hurt others and we usually lower the bar. Feminists by contrast are taught to see self-fulfilment as an obligation. When it comes to exercising self-restraint, they have no such qualms
“In fact WEP remains the only party you can vote for out of naked self-interest and still help everyone else”. (Catherine Mayer – founder)
It is not just that the WEP focuses on reducing female stereotyping while boys fall dramatically behind in schools. Or that in an effort to close the mythical wage gap they celebrate the loss of opportunity for working class men. Nor is it that as female employment increases, male employment goes down.
Feminist self-interest does feed male disadvantage.
But what is truly galling is that if we reversed the situation, if we paid attention to male disadvantage and male interests, so many female problems would be solved.
If we focussed on male employment and male education we would reduce the numbers of disaffected young men who are unemployed, homeless or in prison. In turn, the problem of single parenthood would start to be resolved. If paternity rights were recognised and family courts unbiased, the burden of childcare would also be shared by men. If we took a more holistic approach to domestic violence as a problem created by couples we might go some way to tackling domestic violence itself.
But the WEP do not want to solve these problems – they feed their agenda. What they really want is a femocracy with Saint Sophie at the helm.
Sophie Walker describes herself as a voice for women in Westminster. This is nonsense. Sophie Walker is a voice for feminists. Maybe, but for the vast majority of women., feminism does not reflect their wishes. In fact its voice is too loud.
The most precious years of a woman's life are those when she has young children. However Sandi Toksvig explained in the run up to the Mayoral election.
“If we dealt with all the issues like childcare, like fully employing all the women of London, they would be worth 70 billion pounds to the city a year…”.
The pressure created by feminists to enter the workplace has already stolen years from the time that we spend with our children. We cannot allow the WEP to take those few precious months we have left away.
By submitting the family to the needs of the market, feminism has allowed market forces into the heart of society. The costs of the destruction of the family are the source of our contemporary problems. And they have led to the unviability of our precious welfare state.
The feminist voice is the most destructive in our society. Philip Davies is the only man in a position of public influence who has dared to stand up to the feminist grip on our politics. That is why some of us women have got together to form a group called “Ladies 4 Philip Davies”. Join us, and show him your support.
