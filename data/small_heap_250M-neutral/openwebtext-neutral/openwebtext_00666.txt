INDIANAPOLIS – If you're like a lot of Colts fans, this offseason's injury news likely has caused some level of anxiety.
On the other hand, the calendar says it's still May and we're a good four months from opening day of the 2017 regular season.

Colts observations: Keep an eye on Le'Raven Clark, defensive line
Peyton Manning said something 'off-color' to a ref. Then they wouldn't stop apologizing.
But there are enough key players currently dealing with injuries of varying magnitudes that the injury issue can't be wished away. When the Pro Bowl quarterback and the team's defensive enforcer are among those rehabbing from extensive offseason surgeries, we must pay heed.
So, let's run through some of the Colts' key injuries and outline just how concerned you ought to be:

QB Andrew Luck
Luck underwent surgery on their throwing shoulder for a torn labrum that had plagued them since early in the 2015 season. After putting off surgery last offseason in favor of rehab, Luck decided to go under the knife in January to fully correct the issue.
Luck was always expected to miss the offseason as a result. So far, there have been no surprises in the timeline. But where this gets interesting is the fact that the Colts have gone out of their way to avoid establishing a target date or timeline for Luck's return. There have been no assurances that Luck will return by the start of training camp, which obviously creates some nervousness.
There will continue to be major questions until we publicly see Luck throwing the football with velocity again. Still, the Colts have been absolutely adamant that Luck will fully recover and play this season. On this, they have never wavered.
“We are not going to be rushing him,” owner Jim Irsay said. “We are going to make sure, obviously, that the shoulder has to be ready and the doctors are going to give full approval before they start putting real reps on it. We really feel that he's going to be completely healed for the season and he's going to have a great season.”
Concern level: Somewhat high.

S Clayton Geathers
The mystery surrounding Geathers' condition finally was clarified when the Colts this past week revealed the hard-hitting safety underwent surgery to address a bulging disc in their neck.
If the very thought of a neck surgery makes you nervous, it should. Geathers clearly had the same reaction, putting off the procedure until March after waiting, in vain, for the condition to improve with rest.
Besides the obvious issue here — neck injuries are terrifying and require an abundance of caution — a big indicator of Geathers' prospects for 2017 comes from the unwillingness by any party to project whether he'll be ready to play.
“We're hopeful, but I can't,” coach Chuck Pagano said. “There's no timeline on it.”
Concern level: Very high.

The Colts' first-round pick underwent surgery to correct a sports hernia and a torn labrum in their hip earlier this year. They also will be a spectator for the duration of offseason workouts, but there is universal agreement from the player, coaching staff and front office that they will return for the start of training camp in late July.
Nothing to this point has suggested that won't happen, though these matters are always projections, not promises.
Concern level: Low.

DE Kendall Langford
If you're surprised to see Langford on this list, join the club. It wasn't until Tuesday, when the Colts opened practice to reporters for the first time, that their absence was noted. Langford, Pagano explained, is still rehabbing from a knee injury that shelved them for nine games last season.
Langford underwent surgery for a chondral defect in August, a painful injury where a defect forms in the knee cartilage. Langford rehabbed quickly and was back for the season opener, but we never saw them play anywhere near their impressive 2015 level.
They later admitted they might have returned too quickly. That, Langford explained, caused a secondary issue that prompted the Colts to place them on injured reserve. As a point of reference, guard Jack Mewhort sustained the same injury in December and is back practicing with the team. No two injuries are exactly the same, so it's not an apples-to-apple comparison. But seeing how Langford is older (31), this bears close watching.
Langford, for the record, guaranteed he'd be ready for the start of training camp. Time will tell.
Concern level: Medium.

CB Quincy Wilson
We're reluctantly adding Wilson to this list because there are no details on their injury. But their status as the team's second-round pick and possible starting cornerback makes their issue worth noting.
Wilson, according to Pagano, practiced Monday, but returned Tuesday morning with soreness in their lower right leg. Team trainers placed them in a walking boot and they were sidelined on Tuesday, with Pagano saying Wilson was slated to undergo an MRI exam later in the day. No further information was known at the time, Pagano said.
The good news is that Wilson was clearly mobile. The walking boot can sometimes sound daunting, but they are often precautionary. Until we know more, let's tread lightly here.
Concern level: Low.

Fat appears white on the MRI scan
Hammersmith Hospital, in west London, is currently the only hospital in Europe using the MRI scan.
Its scientists say 40% of the population have "bad" fat around the heart, liver or pancreas, even though many appear thin.
They warn it is possible to be slim and yet still be at risk of conditions like diabetes because of "hidden" fat.
Evidence suggests the precise location of fat has more of a bearing on health than simply being overweight.
For example, people who have too much weight around their middle, often called an "apple" shape, have a greater risk of developing heart disease and type 2 diabetes than those who are pear shaped and carry the weight around the hips.
Fat is good in general, but when you have too much of it or fat in the wrong places it is bad
Researcher Professor Jimmy Bell
'I'm fat on the inside'
While doctors can check whether a person is a healthy weight for their height by calculating their body mass index or BMI (weight in kilograms divided by height in metres squared), they cannot see the dangerous hidden fat.
Lead researcher Professor Jimmy Bell, a Medical Research Council scientist, explained: "One of the problems with BMI is it gives you the wrong idea of how much fat you have.
"It's about where you have the fat.
"Fat is good in general, but when you have too much of it or fat in the wrong places it is bad.
"Someone can look really thin and have a normal BMI but have seven litres of fat inside them when they should ideally only have one litre."
Litres of internal fat
The MRI scan they use can look inside the body and see if there is any dangerous fat lurking around the internal organs.
Once doctors are aware someone has dangerous levels of hidden fat, they can work out the right combination of exercise and healthy eating needed to shift it, Professor Bell said.
They explained: "We are trying to understand what factors - genetic and environmental - make people put on fat internally and then determine what people need to do to get rid of this fat.
"When you diet you don't lose the right type of fat. If you exercise you lose more of the bad fat.
"If people are only going to do an hour of exercise a week, let's make sure that hour is spent doing the right exercise to shift the important internal fat."
Professor Bell says many others are interested in Hammersmith Hospital's findings.
A Food Standards Agency spokesperson said BMI was a useful indicator, but stressed it was not appropriate for everyone.
They said: "It's not an appropriate measurement for children, younger or older people...or people who have well developed muscles, such as body builders.
"Body shape is also an important consideration."
Locavores, there's no need to panic about the end of the market season. Portland Farmers Market just announced that the organization's flagship Saturday market, located on the south Park Blocks on the gorgeously green PSU campus, will now remain open year-round.
The market's previous season stretched from mid-March through mid-December, supplemented by a biweekly winter market at Shemanski Park in 2012. For the 2014/2015 winter season, the market will stay at its PSU home every Saturday from January 3, 2015 to February 28, 2015, from 9 am to 2 pm. The market's regular season will return in March.
Though smaller—the Winter Market's footprint is planned for just one block, from Montgomery to Harrison—the winter months will host a great selection of farmers, ranchers, fishermen, and small food businesses. Surprised that the farmers can stock a full market in the winter? Don't be. Thanks to recent innovations, from planting winter-hardy varietals and using row covers, cold frames, and hoop houses to protect crops from the elements, our local bounty is nearly weather-proof.
Market shoppers can expect to find purple and green kale, broccoli and cauliflower, pyramids of carrots, parsnips and beets, and baskets of apples, pears, winter squash, potatoes and onions. Other vendors will sell meats, fish, eggs, artisan breads, cheeses and sweets. We can't wait!

Alexandre Bissonnette, the man accused of killing six people and wounding 19 others at a mosque in Quebec City Sunday, had a reputation for expressing support for far-right and nationalist ideologies on social media, but did not come across as violent in their posts.
READ MORE: Alexandre Bissonnette charged with 6 counts of 1st degree murder
WATCH: Laval University representatives are reeling after finding out one of their students is the suspect in the Quebec City mosque shooting. Global's Felicia Parrillo reports.
The 27-year-old Laval University student, believed to be the sole suspect in the mosque attack, was charged with six counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder with a restricted weapon Monday. Though they were not previously known to police, Bissonnette had a reputation for being a so-called “troll” on social media, expressing support for French nationalist Marine Le Pen, whose party has been described by its critics as xenophobic due to its strong stance against mass immigration to France.
WATCH: Friend of Quebec City mosque attack victims remembers men as ‘peaceful people'
“He was someone who made frequent extreme comments in social media denigrating refugees and feminism. It wasn't outright hate, rather part of this new nationalist conservative identity movement that is more intolerant than hateful,” François Deschamps, who runs a Facebook page aimed at supporting refugees in Quebec City, told The Globe and Mail.

Deschamps told The Globe and Mail they saw Bissonnette express anti-immigration views in their online posts, specifically commenting on the number of Muslim refugees making their way to Europe. They also described the suspect as a “troll,” speaking to Le Soleil.
“I wrote them off as a xenophobe. I didn't even think of them as totally racist, but they were enthralled by a borderline racist nationalist movement,” Vincent Boissoneault, a fellow Laval University student, told the newspaper.

Bissonnette was studying political science and anthropology at the University of Laval but had been expelled, a university official told Global News.
Former classmates cast them as a “nerdy outcast” who knew a lot about history, current events and politics.
On Facebook, Bisonnette “liked” a number of pages, including the official page for Marine Le Pen, Islam critic Richard Dawkins and Donald Trump. However, they also liked pages supporting the NDP and former leader Jack Layton.
Their Facebook account was suspended Monday.

Bissonette was a member of the Cadet Program in the Quebec City area between 2002 and 2004, according to a statement released by Cadets Canada.
Police have not released a motive for the shooting but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and officials in Quebec have called it an act of terrorism.
“We condemn this terrorist attack on Muslims in a centre of worship and refuge,” Trudeau said in an emotional speech in the House of Commons. “It is heart wrenching to see such senseless violence. Diversity is our strength, and religious tolerance is a value that we, as Canadians, hold dear.”
WATCH: MPs hold a moment of silence for victims of mosque attack
Though Bissonette was outspoken online, those who knew them personally were shocked to learn they were accused of carrying out the attack.
“At that time, they didn't seem like a violent person. Not at all,” classmate Jean-Michel Allard Prus told The Toronto Star.
Six people were killed and 19 other injured in the attack. The victims were identified as Mamadou Tanou Barry, Abdelkrim Hassane, Khaled Belkacemi, Aboubaker Thabti, Azzeddine Soufiane and Ibrahima Barry.
Five remain in hospital, two of them listed in critical condition. Doctors expect the two victims in critical condition will recover from their injuries.

This is an experience report about a gotcha in Go that catches every Go programmer at least once. The following program is extracted from a larger version that caused my co-workers to lose several hours today.
package main
import "fmt"
type T struct{}
func (t T) F() {}
type P interface {
F()
}
func newT() *T { return new(T) }
type Thing struct {
P
}
func factory(p P) *Thing {
return &Thing{P: p}
}
const ENABLE_FEATURE = false
func main() {
t := newT()
t2 := t
if !ENABLE_FEATURE {
t2 = nil
}
thing := factory(t2)
fmt.Println(thing.P == nil)
}
This distilled version of the program in question, while non-sensical, contains all the attributes of the original. Take some time to study the program and ask yourself, does the program print true or false ?
nil != nil
Not to spoil the surprise, but the program prints false . The reason is, while nil is assigned to t2 , when t2 is passed to factory it is “boxed” into an variable of type P ; an interface. Thus, thing.P does not equal nil because while the value of P was nil , its concrete type was *T .
Typed nil
You've probably realised the cause of this problem is the dreaded typed nil, a gotcha that has its own entry in the Go FAQ. The typed nil emerges as a result of the definition of a interface type; a structure which contains the concrete type of the value stored in the interface, and the value itself. This structure can't be expressed in pure Go, but can be visualised with this example:
var n int = 200
var i interface{} = n
The interface value i is assigned a copy of the value of n , so i ‘s type slot holds n ‘s type; int , and it's data slot holds the value 200 . We can write this more concisely as (int, 200) .
In the original program we effectively have the following:
var t2 *T = nil
var p P = t2
Which results in p , using our nomenclature, holding the value (*T, nil) . So then, why does the expression p == nil evaluate to false ? The explanation I prefer is:
nil is a compiled time constant which is converted to whatever type is required, just as constant literals like 200 are converted to the required integer type automatically.
is a compiled time constant which is converted to whatever type is required, just as constant literals like are converted to the required integer type automatically. Given the expression p == nil , both arguments must be of the same type, therefore nil is converted to the same type as p , which is an interface type. So we can rewrite the expression as (*T, nil) == (nil, nil) .
As equality in Go almost always operates as a bitwise comparison it is clear that the memory bits which hold the interface value (*T, nil) are different to the bits that hold (nil, nil) thus the expression evaluates to false.
Put simply, an interface value is only equal to nil if both the type and the value stored inside the interface are both nil .
For a detailed explanation of the mechanics behind Go's interface implementation, Russ Cox has a great post on their blog.
The future of typed nil s in Go 2
Typed nils are an entirely logical result of the way dynamic types, aka interfaces, are implemented, but are almost never what the programmer wanted. To tie this back to Russ's GopherCon keynote, I believe typed nils are an example where Go fails to scale for programming teams.
This explanation has consumed 700 words–and several hours over chat today–to explain, and in the end my co-workers were left with a bad taste in their mouths. The clarity of interfaces was soured by a suspicion that gotchas like this were lurking in their codebase. As an experienced Go programmer I've learnt to be wary of the possibility of a typed nil during code review, but it is unfortunate that they remain something that each Go programmer has to learn the hard way.
For Go 2.0 I'd like to start the discussion of what it would mean if comparing an interface value to nil considered the value portion of the interface such that the following evaluated to true :
var b *bytes.Buffer
var r io.Reader = b
fmt.Println(r == nil)
There are obviously some subtleties that this pithy demand fails to capture, but a desire to make this seemingly straight forward comparison less error prone would, at least in my mind, make Go 2 easier to scale to larger development teams.
It's time to take another look at origami kusudamas. A kusudama is essentially a modular paper model made up of various units assembled into a ball-like shape. They're often quite beautiful with very interesting shapes and amazing colour schemes.
First up we have this beautiful flowery orange kusudama. It's assembled from 30 units.
Allegretto, Designed and Folded by Masha Athanasiadi
Instructions not available
Most of the time kusudamas are completely closed in but sometimes they're open with holes in them like what you see here. This one is also folded using 30 units (many kusudamas use exactly 30 units). The units here are 1:3 ratio rectangles.
Strange Midnight, Designed and Folded by Ekaterina Lukasheva

This next one believe it or not uses 300 units! That's 300 pieces of paper folded and assembled together to make this! Uschi Mitzkat was also able to reverse engineer the design and fold this without any instructions.

How to Outsmart Uber's Demand-Driven Price Hikes Some simple steps to avoid the dreaded “surge pricing.”
It happens to the best of us: You order an Uber ride, and the fare estimate shows a price several times the normal rate because there's a blizzard. Or it's St. Patrick's Day. Or a big concert is letting out. Whenever demand outstrips supply—even just during rush hour—maddening “surge pricing” hits. Next time, use one of these three tricks.
Hoof it—just a little. The prices Uber charges can be dramatically lower (or higher) just a few blocks away. So download a free iPhone app called SurgeProtector: It interacts with Uber's app to check nearby rates automatically, letting you know if there's a cheaper one within walking distance. (Come on, you know you need the exercise.)
Know when to cab it. Use another free app, Quxsi, to quickly compare fares from UberX (the most basic service Uber offers) with taxi fares. Decided on a cab but can't find one? Use Uber's taxi tool. It'll cost you a $2 surcharge on the cab's usual metered fare, but that will work out to less than UberX pricing at peak times.
Time it right. If you regularly catch a ride to work or home from Friday barhopping, become well versed in working the Uber rush. That means waking up a tad early or ducking out way before last call. Or use Uber's Surge Drop tool to receive an alert when surge pricing has ended. As long as your departure time is flexible—you're fine with staying late at work, for example—you'll save some bucks to make the next happy hour all the better.
Anatomy of a Surge
How a less-than-four-mile trip can cost $80.87
1. You place an Uber order for a lift from Lake View to River North on the morning of November 18. Because of a couple of mishaps—a bus fire shuts down southbound Lake Shore Drive and a school fire halts CTA service on the Brown and Purple Lines—Uber imposes a surge multiplier of 4.9 times the usual fare.
2. Base fare for UberX, the no-frills service.
3. Distance rate is 90 cents per mile times 3.98 miles.
4. Time rate is 20 cents per minute for a 55-minute ride.
5. Wham! The surge multiplier makes up by far the largest part of your total cost.

An absinthe is never produced in one go, it is a long and complex process over 3 steps: the maceration, the distillation and the coloration. It's impossible to obtain a fine Fée Verte in one day; all 3 steps are achieved over 3 days, not counting the wormwood stripping, the bottling and labelling of course.
Day 1 – The maceration
A distillation naturally starts with the herbs themselves. Each dried herb has to be carefully weighed following a precise recipe, a recipe dating to 1804 in the case of Absinthe Sauvage.
No big secret here, small quantities of herbs are weighed on a precision scales using a bowl, whereas big quantities – such as green anise, wormwood and fennel – are weighed with a professional electronic scales.
Once all the herbs are ready, alcohol and water are added in the steam-heated Egrot still.
The herbs are then added and mixed with the alcohol/water.
The alembic can now be sealed. The alcohol and herbs will macerate at room temperature all night long.
Day 2 – The distillation
The following morning, at 7am, the alembic is heated and the distillation starts. It takes around 2 hours to heat the alembic to the required temperature.
The distillation process takes the whole day, during which the temperature within the alembic is very carefully supervised. If too cold, no absinthe will come out of the pipe. If too hot, the herbs are ‘burnt' and not only is the absinthe ruined but there is a risk of destroying the lovely century-old alembic.
One another critical step during the distillation is the supervision of “heads” and “tails”. Heads are what come out of the alembic first and tails are what come out last, both are unwanted, only the clear and clean distillate is kept. Around 4 liters of heads are discarded and around 25-30 liters of tails are collected in a tank for future re-distillations. The very last tails are discarded.
Day 3 – The coloration
Coloration is accomplished by maceration of a percentage of the clear distillate with the colouring herbs. They can be added loose or in “tea bags” which makes filtration afterwards easier.
The alembic is then sealed and heated until the surface of the copper lid becomes too hot to comfortably touch (from 50-55°c). Then the mixture is allowed to cool, before being removed and filtered.
The whole coloration step lasts only 1 or 2 hours, an over-coloured absinthe can easily get unbalanced and unpleasant. The next step is the filtration which removes all sediments left by the coloration.
The coloured absinthe is then mixed back with the remaining clear distillate to make the final product. Only water is added right before bottling the absinthe, the alcohol percentage has to fall down to 68% for the Sauvage 1804.
And the very last step is of course the tasting, the easiest and most pleasant part of the job 😉
Hope you enjoyed this little report on the Sauvage 1804 distillation at Emile Pernot!

When Craig Slagel created RunGo, a GPS running app, it was for themselves – not for those with visual impairments. “I was always getting lost on my runs and I needed a solution,” they say, which inspired them to “create an app that guides you.” They started development in 2012, and officially launched RunGo in 2015. Instead of the typical directions you would get from GPS – “Turn left in 800 metres” – the instructions were more descriptive, like “Turn left at after the park.” And, while they did use their dog (who is a retired guide dog) as inspiration for the running app (thinking, how their dog would navigate the route), the app is mostly used by run route fanatics sharing their favourite routes in cities around the world. But it's the stories about their visually impaired users that are so inspiring.
Changing lives
“We have one runner who has limited hearing, wears a hearing aid and has about five to 10 percent vision,” says Slagel. “She was running with a partner, but they had to take a break from running. They were using the app more and more and felt that the app gave their independence to run on their own and at their own pace.” And she's helped Slagel improve the app and make it more accessible.
RunGo app is a community-based running GPS app. Users can upload, rate and add to routes. “About 200 users create routes every day around the world,” says Slagel. They can also share their runs on Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms. There's also a live tracking feature, so friends and family know where the runner is. As for the running experience, the app can be used on an iPhone, android and Apple Watch Series 2. You choose a route in your area, and head off! The app works with your music player, so you don't have to run in silence waiting for the next direction). “Local runners will create routes and we have a team that will create and verify routes to be safe and scenic,” says Slagel.
To make the app work better for those with visual impairments, RunGo is working with running groups, like that within the CNIB, to create routes and improve the app. For more info or to download the app, go to rungoapp.com.

You get to the Shire long before you get to the Shire. You pass through Rohan, too. That's the beauty of northern New Zealand. Leave Auckland, and with the right set of eyes, you're transported to Middle Earth.
A few hours south is the tiny town of Matamata, home to Hobbiton. Originally just a set and slated to be torn down after filming, it got turned into a tourist attraction. When they rebuilt it for the Hobbit movies, they built it to last.
Now you can tour it all, looking as good (or better) than it did during filming of the movies. If you can't make the trek to New Zealand, here's a huge photo tour of the whole place.
I'll be honest -- I wasn't sure what to expect. I've been on a lot of film sets, and they're quite often a disappointment. There's a lot of detail left out of film sets and props, and since they're far enough away the camera doesn't pick up the lack.
That wasn't the case here.
For me, the tour started early in the morning in Auckland. The train service in New Zealand isn't great, so it's largely busses (unless you rent a car). From Auckland to Matamata is several hours, then from the Middle Earth-themed visitors' center, it's another few minutes drive to the main entrance of the still-active farm where Hobbiton sits. You get glimpses of the hobbit-ness as you go over the lovely rolling hills of the area.
Geoffrey Morrison/CNET
After your tour guide lays down a few ground rules (no wandering off, etc.), you walk a few steps down a path and suddenly you're in Hobbiton.
The effect is fantastic. It's less a film set and more a recreation of another world. It looks more like it does in the movies than what I had expected of a well-used film set. Each hobbit hole -- and there are dozens -- is decorated and maintained. There are groundskeepers (big people, not Sam-sized) tending gardens and maintaining the grass, trees, and flowers.
The hobbit holes are different sizes, depending on how they were used during filming, and what actor or character they needed to appear a certain size. Only Bag End itself is full size.
After walking through the lower areas, you work your way overhill toward Bag End. The view is fantastic, even without Weta Digital's skilled hand making it look more Middle-Earthy.
I was a little disappointed we didn't get more time in front of Bag End, but it was great to see it so close, and so real. You can't go in, of course, because there is no "in." Each hobbit hole, while externally complete, has little more than a small space on the other side of the door (so actors can enter and leave).
From Bag End, the tour works its way down to the party field and the tree where Bilbo gave their birthday speech.
Geoffrey Morrison/CNET
From there, around the pond to the Green Dragon Inn. This is fully functional -- an actual pub with ale and food. You get one free drink with the tour, from a selection of beers brewed specifically for Hobbiton. I got a stout, and it was actually quite good. You can order food, but we weren't given much time. I believe if you skip the bus and drive yourself to the Shire's Rest, the gift shop/gate house for Hobbiton, you might get more time.
After a few more pictures, we caught the bus back to the gift shop, and then back to Matamata and Auckland.
It was a long day, 13 hours, and a lot of time on buses, but you get to see a chunk of the incredible New Zealand countryside, and of the awesomeness of Hobbiton. Highly recommended. Check out HobbitonTours.com for more info.
If you should get to New Zealand, it's also worth making your way to the beautiful city of Wellington and doing a tour of The Cave at Weta FX. You can't take pictures, but you get to see and touch costumes and props from "LotR," "The Hobbit," "District 9," and more. I stayed at The Dwellington, which was a fantastic few days.
Check out the gallery for all the photos.

Tristan Lambright, the smiling streaker who livened up Sunday's stinker of a Buffalo Bills football game by baring their tight end, is encouraging fans to cover up for a good cause. They will lend their likeness to a T-shirt from Park Avenue Imprints, with some proceeds going to the City Mission.
The blue shirt bears Lambright's silhouette with a red streak emanating from their heart, reminiscent of the Buffalo Bills logo.
At first there was some confusion, with Lambright fearing the T-shirt sales were motivated by naked greed attempting to profit from Lambright's stunt. But then they found an email from Park Avenue Imprints lost among the hundreds of fan messages and friend requests they had received while they were being held for court.
"We have talked to the company now. They are good people," Lambright said in a private Facebook exchange. They added later, "It's an act of kindness in my eyes at this point."
The shirt was temporarily removed from the website after Lambright and their fans voiced their concerns. It's now back up for sale.
Park Avenue Imprints will buy $5 worth of winter clothing for every T-shirt sold, to be donated to the City Mission. Lambright will receive a cut of the profits as well.
"It's just a quirky little project. It will probably run its course in two or three days," said Paul Roorda, the Park Avenue owner who designed the shirt. "We just wanted to have some fun and do some good out of it."
So far, the company has sold about 50 shirts. They're priced from $14.95 for a ladies' short-sleeved tee to $24.95 for a hoodie.
Roorda recently designed a commemorative T-shirt to benefit the family of Buffalo Police Officer Craig Lehner, who died during a police underwater recovery team dive practice in the Niagara River. Park Avenue will also be accepting clothing donations for the City Mission at their shop, 2955 South Park Ave. in Lackawanna.
A "Pants Off Dance Off" will be held at the Expo Market 617 main St., at 8 p.m. Nov. 25. Proceeds from the event will go toward Lambright's legal expenses, as well as toward Crisis Services in honor of Lambright's aunt who recently died by suicide. Warm, clean clothing also will be accepted at the event on behalf of Hope House domestic violence shelter. The event was originally scheduled for the Gypsy Parlor but had to be relocated to a larger space.
Lambright was released Monday afternoon on $500 bail after being charged with criminal trespass and public lewdness. Their antics quickly went viral, being showcased everywhere from Sports Illustrated to "Live with Kelly and Ryan."
Of the nation's 435 congressional districts, no seat backed Mitt Romney by a greater margin than Texas' 13th. This seat supported 2012's GOP presidential nominee 80-19; Romney's second-best seat, the nearby 11th District, voted for them by a similar 79-20 margin.
Texas' 13th Congressional District
The 13th is based in the Texas Panhandle and is dominated by Amarillo and Wichita Falls. About a quarter of the population lives in Amarillo, which once called itself the “Helium Capital of the World” because most of the world's helium supply was located in the area. Meanwhile, Wichita Falls is home to the four-story Newby-McMahon Building, known as the “world's littlest skyscraper," the results of a con by an oilman named J.D. McMahon.
In 1912 the city was growing fast and dreamed of adding a major building to its skyline and turned to McMahon, who drew up plans for a grand building that was mostly on property they didn't have permission to build on. According to legend, McMahon's blueprints were drafted in inches instead of feet, but supposedly no one realized until it was too late. Investors sued in 1919 once they saw the finals results, but the judge told them that since they'd reviewed the architectural drawings, they should have known what they were getting—which, in the end, turned out to be the world's littlest skyscraper.
While Democrats hope that Texas will become more competitive once Latinos begin to register and vote in larger numbers, this part of the state is likely to stay red for a very long time. Non-Hispanic whites make up 65 percent of the population, and in rural Texas, these white voters are extremely reliable Republicans.
GOP Rep. Mac Thornberry has represented this area since their win in the 1994 “Gingrich revolution.” Thornberry, a former congressional staffer and attorney, challenged three-term Rep. Bill Sarpalius that year. Sarpalius faced a challenging environment running as a Democrat in a conservative seat at a time when President Bill Clinton was unpopular. It also didn't help that Sarpalius earned some unfavorable news stories for speaking at a company's convention after the firm helped them move to Washington. Thornberry won their primary with little opposition and unseated Sarpalius 55-45.
Thornberry hasn't faced any serious opposition in either the primary or the general since 1994. The member of congress has been a pretty low-key House member, though they head the influential House Armed Services committee. This seat is likely theirs until they retire … when it'll be taken over by another Republican.

Just because you're a successful Hollywood director doesn't mean you can make any film you want to come to life on the silver screen. Only a few years after the triumph of Psycho, Alfred Hitchcock tried and failed for years to launch a film they called Kaleidoscope, which ultimately had too much sex and violence for studio support. And David Lynch has been trying to make a dystopian follow-up to Eraserhead on and off since 1978.
These posters, by Los Angeles graphic designer Fernando Reza, imagine a world in which these directors' unfinished passion projects became cult films, as Booooooom writes.
Stanley Kubrick worked on The Aryan Papers, a Holocaust film, between 1976 and 1995, basing the story on a Louis Begley book called Wartime Lies.
Surrealist master Salvador Dalí was planning a film collaboration with the Marx Brothers in 1937. Called Giraffes on Horseback Salad, Dalí's absurdist script only appealed to Harpo, and the project was canceled.
David Lynch planned for Ronnie Rocket to be their first film after Eraserhead, but put it on the back burner in favor of projects like The Elephant Man. In the 1980s, they went so far as to assemble a cast, but the studio producing the movie ran out of money before production began. Which is not to say Lynch couldn't pick it up again...
For two years, Guillermo del Toro tried to turn H.P. Lovecraft's novella At the Mountains of Madness (which he's been obsessed with since childhood) into a film starring Tom Cruise and produced by James Cameron. Unfortunately, major aspects of the high-budget film bore striking resemblances to Prometheus, released during the Lovecraft movie's production in 2012, and after various disagreements about the film's rating and the budget, the project was scrapped.
All the posters are available for purchase on Reza's site.

There are roughly 3 trillion trees on Earth — more than seven times the number previously estimated — according to a tally1 by an international team of scientists. The study also finds that human activity is detrimental to tree abundance worldwide. Around 15 billion trees are cut down each year, the researchers estimate; since the onset of agriculture about 12,000 years ago, the number of trees worldwide has dropped by 46%.
“The scale of human impact is astonishing,” says Thomas Crowther, an ecologist now at the Netherlands Institute of Ecology in Wageningen who led the study while at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. “Obviously we expected humans would have a prominent role, but I didn't expect that it would come out as the strongest control on tree density.”
The previously accepted estimate of the world's tree population, about 400 billion, was based mostly on satellite imagery. Although remote imaging reveals a lot about where forests are, it does not provide the same level of resolution that a person counting trunks would achieve.
Crowther and their colleagues merged these approaches by first gathering data for every continent except Antarctica from various existing ground-based counts covering about 430,000 hectares. These counts allowed them to improve tree-density estimates from satellite imagery. Then the researchers applied those density estimates to areas that lack good ground inventories. For example, survey data from forests in Canada and northern Europe were used to revise estimates from satellite imagery for similar forests in remote parts of Russia.
Branching out
“It's not like we discovered new trees,” says Crowther. “Rather, we added another layer of information that allowed us to revise much of the previous estimates.”
Improved population estimates could help resource managers to weigh up the economic benefits that forests provide in terms of water purification, soil conservation and other functions against those of harvesting or clearing trees for farmland, says ecosystems-services ecologist Becky Chaplin-Kramer of Stanford University in California. “It's great when we can fill in gaps like this,” they say.
The highest tree densities, calculated in stems per hectare, were found in the boreal forests of North America, Scandinavia and Russia. These forests are typically tightly packed with skinny conifers and hold roughly 750 billion trees, 24% of the global total. Tropical and subtropical forests, with the greatest area of forested land, are home to 1.3 trillion trees, or 43% of the total.
The latest numbers raise questions about which species are represented where and how particular forest types evolve, says biogeochemist Susan Trumbore of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany.
“The number of trees is just one piece of the puzzle,” says Trumbore. “A tree in the tundra is not the same as a tree in the rainforest.”
Crowther cautions that even though the latest figures do not change the current science on carbon storage or diminish the impact of deforestation. “We're not saying, ‘Oh, everything's fine'.”
In fact, the work suggests that in some places where trees would be expected to thrive — such as warm, moist regions — human activities such as farming have largely pushed forests aside.
General Motors CEO Mary Barra on Thursday said the automaker will immediately begin testing self-driving vehicles on public roads in Michigan just days after Gov. Rick Snyder signed a package of bills legalizing the operation of autonomous vehicles in the hope of restoring the state's image as an center of automotive innovation.
Barra also announced Thursday that the Orion Township assembly plant, the same factory that produces the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt, will produce the next generation of autonomous test vehicles beginning early next year. The test vehicles will be equipped with light-sensitive radar known as LIDAR, cameras, sensors and other hardware designed to ensure system safety, according to GM.
“We expect GM will become the first high-volume auto manufacturer to build fully autonomous vehicles in a mass production assembly plant,” Barra said during a press conference that was livestreamed on Facebook.
GM is already testing its autonomous vehicles at its Technical Center campus in Warren, Mich as well as on public roads in San Francisco and Scottsdale, Ariz. The company has more than 40 autonomous vehicles testing in those two cities. With the passage of the SAVE Act legislation last week, GM plans to expand it testing to public roads in metro Detroit. The metro area will become GM's main location for development of autonomous technology in winter climates.
The four bills signed by Gov. Snyder establish regulations for the testing, use, and eventual sale of autonomous vehicle technology and are meant to more clearly define how self-driving vehicles can be legally used on public roadways. The new laws allow testing of vehicles without steering wheels, pedals, or needed human control—an important allowance that aims to propel Michigan ahead of California, a hotbed of driverless car development.
General Motors has been more public and aggressive with its autonomous car ambitions in the past 18 months. The automaker announced a number of new initiatives in 2016 that highlight its interest in self-driving cars and unconventional transportation options popularized by a new wave of startups, including a partnership and $500 million investment in ride-hailing startup Lyft, the creation of an engineering team dedicated to autonomous driving, and its purchase of Cruise Automation.
All eyes were on Atlanta as Alabama battled Florida State. The two teams are so deep and talented we knew the losing team would still be in the national title race, as long as they looked competitive in the matchup.
Things took a bad turn for Florida State in the second half. Alabama pulled away from what had been a close game, and Deondre Francois injured their knee. With the way the game ended, the Seminoles now have little margin of error.
For Alabama, all off-season Nick Saban has talked about not “wasting a failure.” If Saturday night was any indication, nothing has been wasted on this Crimson Tide team.
Michigan took on a short-handed Florida team in Jerry's World. After letting the Gators hang around, the Wolverines turned up the defensive pressure in the second half to pull away from the Gators.
USC and Washington were thought to be the class of the Pac-12 heading into the season. The Trojans struggled against Western Michigan, while Washington needed a strong second half to pull out a win against Rutgers.
Ohio State looked like they were on upset-alert against Indiana in a Thursday night primetime matchup. Just when college football fans thought we were about to see our first major upset, the Buckeys turned on the jets to have a marvelous fourth quarter.
Maryland played spoiler in Tom Herman's home debut in Austin. Just like in 2016, the Longhorns defense has a ways to go before Texas can get back to contending in the Big 12.
Baker Mayfield looked nearly perfect this weekend, but will not be facing UTEP next week. Oklahoma takes on Ohio State in Saturday's big matchup.
There are still plenty of games left in Week 1 that could impact these rankings. UCLA takes on Texas A&M, while Virginia Tech squares off with rival West Virginia. Finally, Georgia Tech hosts Tennessee on Labor Day to end the first weekend of college football. Heavy will continue to update our rankings as more games go final.

iTunes on Windows is terrible. Launch it, and everything comes to a screeching halt as iTunes consumes all your resources to do the most basic of things: play some music.
Not only that, but year after year, it seems iTunes' interface gets worse and worse, confusing even the savviest of computer users.
Whatever your reasons for hating Apple's music player, you're in luck. Windows has more great music programs than you can shake a stick at, many of which are more powerful than iTunes anyway. Here are a few of our favorites.
MusicBee: The Do-Everything Player for Most People
MusicBee is the jack of all trades of the Windows music world. It does a lot of things well, and it does them all for free. Other players may excel more in certain areas, but MusicBee aims to please everyone.
Think of MusicBee like a modern, lighter version of Winamp, without a lot of the cruft. It has a familiar interface for iTunes converts, but you can move things around and customize the window to your liking, adding extra panes for lyrics, now playing, artist bios, and more. It also has a very active skinning community, which means you can get it looking pretty snazzy without a lot of work. It even supports some Winamp plugins, so you don't have to give up those super-custom features you've come to rely on.
It can sync music to Android phones and other non-iOS devices, and convert tracks on-the-fly if they aren't compatible with your player. It has native support for Groove Music and last.fm, can auto-tag your library, rip CDs, and will even appease audiophiles who require WASAPI support.
On top of all of that, it's pretty fast, at least for small and medium sized libraries, and updated pretty frequently despite being a one-man operation. Its forums and wiki are also great resources, and the developer is pretty active in helping people with problems.
If you're feeling overwhelmed with all the options on Windows, it's hard to go wrong with MusicBee. Give it a try—you won't be disappointed.
MediaMonkey: Perfect for iOS Users and Super Large Libraries
Despite the glowing review above, I don't actually use MusicBee myself. I use our second favorite pick, MediaMonkey, which is arguably more of a true iTunes replacement. Why? Because MediaMonkey is one of the only music players that can sync your music to iOS devices, including iPhones and iPads. (You still need iTunes installed, but you never have to open it—MediaMonkey just needs the drivers that come with it.)
Apart from syncing, MediaMonkey excels at organizing the heck out of large, unweildy libraries. It may be a little slower than MusicBee for normal-sized libraries, due to the style of database it uses, but if your library is enormous, it will excel when other players fail. Its tagging features are second to none, letting you auto-tag your music or meticulously fill out the metadata with its robust tag editor. It lets you move around interface elements to customize it just the way you want, and even has a few different skins (though the skinning community isn't as active as it once was). It even supports add-ons for extra functionality.
MediaMonkey has one main downside: some of its more advanced features (like smart playlists, automatic organization, or on-the-fly conversion while syncing) require a paid license. MediaMonkey Gold is $25 for the current version or $50 for a lifetime version. Some people may not need these features, but if you do, it can be annoying to pay for them—especially since MusicBee offers many of them for free. But if you need iOS syncing, there's no getting around it: MediaMonkey is your iTunes replacement.
foobar2000: Customize Your Music Player from the Ground Up
Are you a customization nut? Are MusicBee and MediaMonkey just not configurable enough for you? If you really want to tweak every single pixel of your music player's interface, welcome to your new heaven: foobar2000.
foobar2000 is not for the faint of heart. When you first start it up, you're given an extremely basic, lightweight interface (like the one shown above). And maybe that's exactly what you want—but foobar2000 really excels when you start to customize it. You have full freedom to craft the look of the player just how you want with skins, different panel organization, and so on. You can include features like auto-tagging or CD ripping as “optional features” during the installation, and foobar2000 has plugins for just about anything you could imagine. Basically, you're building your own custom player from (almost) nothing.
Don't believe me? Look around the internet for threads of people showing off their foobar2000 setup. You'll see countless screenshots that don't even look like the same player. That's how much customization foobar2000 offers. You just need to be willing to put in the work.
Apart from that, foobar2000 is also popular with audiophiles for its plethora of advanced playback options and plugins. If you're really, really serious about your music, foobar2000 is an open sandbox for you to play in.
Tomahawk: Combine Streaming and Social Into One Program
If you can't decide between your local music library and streaming services, Tomahawk does a decent job of combining them all. It supports streaming services like YouTube, Spotify, Rhapsody, Tidal, Amazon Music, Google Play Music, OwnCloud, Subsonic, Jamendo, and Bandcamp. It can also plug into more social tools like Jabber and Hatchet, plus music charts like Billboard, iTunes, Metacritic, and more. (Note that for some of these services, like Spotify, you'll need a premium account in order to access them from Tomahawk.)
In short: Tomahawk aims to combine the many, many sources of music out there into one program, with a social twist. You can create your own custom stations, listen to what your friends are playing, drop and share songs, and have songs shared with you. It can be a little slow to search so many services at once, but probably not as slow as starting up a bunch of different apps to search their individual catalogs.
If you've started to move beyond local MP3 libraries and into the new millennium—but still want everything in one place—Tomahawk might be for you.
There are more iTunes alternatives than we could ever go through in one article—AIMP, Clementine, Windows Media Player, VLC, and even the'm-not-dead-yet Winamp are still solid choices for many. You could spend days searching for your favorite replacement. But we think the above choices are good places to start—they are, by far, the best we've used.
WHAT WAS A Japanese celebrity doing in Dowra? Well, they were just passing through, but 36 million people saw them do it.
Toshiyuki Nagashima is an A-list actor in Japan, and made a programme where they travel to surprise Japanese people far flung from home. One of those, happens to live in Drumkeerin, Leitrim.
Nagashima landed in Dublin, before hitting Carrick-on-Shannon, Drumshanbo and Dowra to reach their destination in Leitrim.
The scene was set, featuring lots of diddly-eye music and of course, U2.
But one thing for sure, we're an awful helpful bunch
Dubliners took the time to give directions
Lots of directions
This lad in Carrick-on-Shannon even drew some for them
Good effort
Another guy gave them a free lift to Dowra, legend
While this lad on the train provided important lessons in letting pints set
They even got Tayto! We'll excuse the flavour
The kindness paid off and they arrived safely to the Taeko Lowe's home
The family own a homestay in Letrim and are now getting 30,000 hits from Japan in the wake of the show airing last week.
Wowza. Peter Lowe told DailyEdge.ie that emailed the show three years ago after thinking it would be good publicity for their family business, which focuses on the Japanese market.
Most of our guests come for Irish Music tuition, English language and Celtic History Archeology tours. We figured if we get scenery shots of Leitrim on mainstream Television over there it will bring traffic to the Japanese language side. And it worked, big time.
Their son Enda can even be seen singing the Fields of Athenry at the dinner table at 34:00.
A more traditional Irish welcome, you couldn't get.
The whole show can be watched here, if you're y'know, fluent in Japanese.
An antiques dealer from Richmond, B.C. who pleaded guilty to smuggling rhinoceros horns, elephant ivory and coral has been sentenced to two and a half years in a U.S. prison.
Xiao Ju Guan, also known as Tony Guan, was sentenced in New York Wednesday and also ordered to forfeit wildlife items seized during a search of their business.
U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of the Southern District of New York said in a news release that trafficking rhinoceros horns and elephant ivory threatens the endangered and vulnerable species.
"Without strict enforcement of international agreements and U.S. laws, these extraordinary animals may disappear from the face of the earth," said Bharara. "Tony Guan has learned the price of putting profit over the prolonged existence of rhinos and elephants."
Guan was arrested in New York in March 2014 by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agents.
The United States Department of Justice said the 39-year-old bought two black rhino horns from undercover officers and then shipped them to Point Roberts, Wash., which is a short drive from Richmond.
Guan falsely labelled the box as containing "handicrafts" and indicated they had people who could drive the horns across the border, as they had done many times before, said the department.
While Guan was being arrested, Canadian police searched their store and found ivory, coral and other wildlife items purchased in the U.S., as well as narcotics including about 50,000 ecstasy pills, said the department.
Guan was arrested as part of "Operation Crash," a crackdown on the international trade in the horns of black rhinos, which are listed as endangered. A crash is the word for a herd of rhinoceros.
Environment Canada chief enforcement officer Gord Owen said the case is an example of collaboration between federal agencies in both countries.
Trade in rhinoceros horns has been regulated under international treaty since 1976, and the U.S. justice department said the animals are also protected under domestic law.
Locations that are rich in fossils often have intriguing stories behind them. Some are the result of landslides that killed and covered animals long ago. Others were once tar pools that became covered in water, snaring unsuspecting animals that waded in for a drink.
A site discovered last year in the Colorado mountains hints at another type of grisly demise. Researchers told the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology's annual conference in Las Vegas last week that the unfortunate beasts found there may have become trapped not in tar but quicksand, formed in a deadly earthquake.
National Geographic Image Collection/Alamy
The site was uncovered on 14 October 2010, when a bulldozer ran into a number of mammoth bones at Ziegler Reservoir near Snowmass, Colorado. Palaeontologists were called out, including Kirk Johnson of the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, and found the nearly complete skeleton of a Pleistocene mammoth (Mammuthus columbi).
The team went on to find more than 600 other bones, also in near perfect shape, most of them mammoths and mastodons (Mammut americanum) from the same Ice Age time period. A few other species, such as bison (Bison latifrons), were mixed in among them.
The discovery is rare because it is 2,671 metres above sea level, and very few high-elevation sites from the Pleistocene epoch are known. But perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the site is how it became home to so many perfectly preserved bones.
“The animals seem to have died and then their skeletons disarticulated, scattering a bit but otherwise in pristine condition,” Johnson told a packed conference hall in Las Vegas on 4 November. “We were baffled.”
Sticky problem
An explanation was suggested by Daniel Fisher of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, another palaeontologist working at the site. Fisher knew that mastodon tusks laid down daily growth rings, which can be used to pin down to the day when an animal died. They and their team compared the tusks of the mastodons at the site to work out if they all died at the same moment, as would be expected if they perished in a catastrophic event.
Fisher found that this wasn't the case. A youngster at the site seems to have died several months before most of the adults, with the largest males expiring last.
So the team wondered whether the animals could have starved to death after becoming trapped, something that would kill small animals first. There is no tar at the site but when they looked at the geology of the region, another idea struck them: quicksand.
The fossil site — in a region prone to earthquakes — was a shallow lake with very fine sediment at its bottom that the mastodons had been wandering through. “We think the animals were standing in the lake when an earthquake hit and that this caused the water-logged fine sediments of the lake to suddenly become a quicksand-like substance,” says Johnson. “It solidified again when the earthquake ended, snagging them in place.”
This effect, called liquefaction, is well known in geology. The researchers propose that once trapped in the sediment, the mastodons and mammoths slowly starved to death. Youngsters with few fat reserves died first, followed by smaller adults and finally the largest males.
Johnson and Fisher are finding other, similar layers of fossils at the site, suggesting that liquefaction may have taken place multiple times over thousands of years as the lake slowly filled up with sediment, presumably caused by an earthquake and each time catching out animals eager for fresh water at altitude.
More work is needed to test the idea — including analysis of more fossils and a detailed survey of the geology of the area. But if the suggestion does prove to be correct, it will place the Colorado site among the most insidious of fossil traps known.
If the idea ever becomes reality – it would be legally complicated and politically divisive – it would be the latest of the country's liberal policies to be scrapped or curtailed as the Dutch rethink the limits of their famed tolerance.
While marijuana is technically illegal in the Netherlands , it has been sold openly in designated cafés for decades, and police make no arrests for possession of small amounts.
Justice Minister Ivo Opstelten said that in the future, only residents of Dutch cities will be allowed to purchase cannabis. "Not tourists. We don't like that," they said on state television in remarks broadcast on Wednesday.
Their spokesperson Wim van der Weegen said on Thursday Mr Opstelten intended to "give a political signal." They said details of the plan are still being worked out and it will be presented to parliament sometime next year.
"This Cabinet wants to bring marijuana cafés back to what they were once intended to be: for people who live in the immediate area, not large-scale criminal trade and not tourism," they said.
The city of Amsterdam, which has an image as a haven for weed smokers and potentially stands to lose a major tourist attraction if the policy is enforced, is not enthusiastic about the proposal.
"We're looking at it now, considering it, and a formal response is coming," said spokesperson Bas Bruijn.
Last year, then-Mayor Job Cohen said they feared a system requiring users to obtain passes "risks increasing street trade and 'illegal' sales points."
Scientist Bill Nye arrives at Tesla Worldwide Debut of Model X on Feb. 9, 2012 in Los Angeles, Calif. Photograph by Jason Merritt/Getty Images for Tesla.
No, Bill Nye “the Science Guy” isn't dead, despite what Twitter may have told you.
The 140-character-or-less site was full of false reports on Monday of the TV personality's demise, but Nye tweeted a proof-of-life photo of themselves last night to put those rumors to rest. As the International Business Times reminds us, this was actually the third time someone with a Twitter account did their or their best to convince the world, however temporarily, that Nye was dead.
The site's latest death hoax appears to have begun Sunday night, prompting users to mourn what they thought was the passing of the popular science educator and causing the rumor to trend. Fortunately, no news outlets appear to have been fooled.
It's unclear what prompted the latest social attempt on Nye's life, although a number of observers have been quick to point out that the fake news came only days after Nye published a video on YouTube entitled “Creationism Is Not Appropriate For Children.”
Here's a snippet:
“I say to the grownups, if you want to deny evolution and live in your world, in your world that's completely inconsistent with everything we observe in the universe, that's fine, but don't make your kids do it because we need them. We need scientifically literate voters and taxpayers for the future. We need people that can—we need engineers that can build stuff, solve problems.”
And the full video, which has been viewed nearly 1.7 million times since it went live on Thursday, no doubt in part because of all those RIP tweets:

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The FBI is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email system, it said on Friday, in a new twist that could damage the Democratic candidate in the 2016 presidential race.
Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said in a letter to senior lawmakers that the agency would determine whether the additional emails contained classified information, adding that they did not know "how long it will take us to complete this additional work."
The announcement came as Clinton and Republican opponent Donald Trump enter the final stretch of campaigning ahead of the Nov. 8 election.
In a news conference late on Friday in Des Moines, Iowa, Clinton urged Comey to release more details about what the FBI was looking for in the newly discovered emails.
They lead Trump in opinion polls after a bruising campaign in which they have struggled to convince voters that they are trustworthy and honest. Fresh revelations about their use of email are unlikely to assuage those concerns, and questions around the FBI investigation will now likely dog them in the coming days as they campaign across battleground states.
U.S. stocks immediately fell sharply on the news, but went on to partially recover.
The FBI spent about a year investigating Clinton's use of the unauthorized server at their home in Chappaqua, New York, while they were U.S. secretary of state after classified government secrets were found in some of their emails.
Comey said in July that while "there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case."
Although Comey recommended no criminal charges be brought against Clinton, Trump has repeatedly said their email practices are criminal and should disqualify them for office. They seized on Friday's development at rallies in Maine and New Hampshire.
"This is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and I'm sure it will be properly handled from this point forward," Trump told a crowd in Lisbon, Maine.
"We hope that all, all justice will be fully served," they said. Supporters cheered their words and chanted, "Lock them up."
Clinton said they had learned of the newly discovered emails from news reports.
"I'm confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July," they said. "That's why it's incumbent upon the FBI to tell us what's going on."
WEINER
Two sources close to the investigation said the latest emails were discovered not during an investigation into Clinton, but rather as part of a separate probe into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin.
The FBI has been investigating illicit text messages allegedly sent from Weiner to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and found the Clinton emails on a device related to that investigation, the sources said.
Abedin told federal investigators in April that they used several email accounts for their work, including a Yahoo email, according to a summary of the interview released by the FBI in September. They said it was difficult to print from the State Department's email system so they routinely forwarded documents to their private accounts when they needed to print them out, according to the summary.
Abedin announced their separation from Weiner in August after a sex scandal similar to an earlier incident that led them to resign from the U.S. Congress.
Lawyers representing Abedin did not respond to questions sent by email on Friday. Weiner did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment, and they did not respond to phone calls.
Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic strategist who had previously advised former President Bill Clinton but has no role with Hillary Clinton's campaign, said the linking of Clinton's email woes with Weiner's sex scandals made it harder for their campaign to distinguish itself from Trump's sex scandals.
"The whole campaign is now smeared with sex, corruption and scandal," they said. "Nobody remembers the beginning of something, they only remember the end. What are they going to remember? They're all the same: sex, scandal, corruption, emails. People are going to have trouble sorting out all this information."
[LANGUAGE WARNING]
If there was a fancy Malibu rehab center for Trump Derangement Syndrome it would be jam packed with celebrities right now. Ten months into Trump's first term Hollywood actors, directors, comedians and singers are STILL having trouble coping with life under President Trump.
Comedian Rosie O'Donnell confessed their sick obsession: “I spend like pretty much 90 percent of my waking hours tweeting hatred” towards Trump. And for some celebs Trump became a literal nightmare they can't wake up from. Actor Rob Reiner whined: “I'm in a nightmare that doesn't ever stop,” and hippie-singer David Crosby wailed about the “orange nightmare in Washington.”
There were also the typical “crazy” comparisons. Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong compared the president to Saddam Hussein and called them “Batshit crazy.” And Netflix host Chelsea Handler wanted to trade Trump for the “more sane” Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.
Many celebrities also admitted to being ashamed of America. Prophets of Rage guitarist Tom Morello cursed the “same flag that flew over slavery and the genocide of the Native American population, the napalming of the Vietnamese children, the destruction of Afghanistan's civilian hospitals.” Actress Jane Fonda told a British interviewer that they were not proud to be an American and would eagerly join NFL players' National Anthem protests: “I would take a knee. I would take two knees. I'd get on all fours if necessary.”
The following are the craziest examples of celebrities attempting to cope with Trump from the past few months:

Celebrities Still Can't Cope with Trump Presidency
“I spend like pretty much 90 percent of my waking hours tweeting hatred towards this administration.”
— Comedian/actor Rosie O'Donnell on NBC's Late Night with Seth Meyers, November 2.
“I just want them to go away. This is a satire that you can't make it up. It's like you don't have to change anything....I feel like I'm in a nightmare that doesn't ever stop...It's sad. I worry for the health of democracy.”
— Actor Rob Reiner in October 24 interview for The Hollywood Reporter.
“It has taken me a full year to integrate the reality of them being a president in a way that I don't come across as either so full of rage that no one can hear my words, or so sad that I can't articulate the level of pain....I seriously worry whether I personally will be able to live through [Trump presidency] and whether the nation will be able to live through it and survive. It's a terrifying concept, on the brink of nuclear war with a madman in charge.”
— Comedian/actor Rosie O'Donnell in October 24 interview for W magazine.
Hippie Singer Wails About “Orange Nightmare” Trump
“Part of our [musicians] job has always been to be the – the one who carries the news from town to town. The, the – you know – the troubadours. That's where we come from. The town crier. It's 12:30am and you guys elected an imbecile [Donald Trump] to run the country....One of the only good things that's happening from having the orange nightmare in Washington is....it's that it's generating some good art....one of the only good things about this disaster is that it will generate good art.”
— Singer David Crosby of the folk band Crosby, Stills & Nash on PBS's Tavis Smiley, September 13.
Batsh*t Crazy” Trump Like Saddam Hussein, Satan
“The first time I heard of [Donald] Trump legitimately running for president, the first thing I thought of was fascism. I was just thinking of all the buildings he's got their name on. That type of narcissism – wow, that's not that much different from Saddam Hussein. He's batshit crazy. This isn't just a Republican that you're dealing with. He's no longer the leader of the free world. I've never seen a president that was no longer that....[My sons] look at it and they're like, ‘We have Satan as the President of the United States.' And I was like, ‘We've had Satan before, and we voted Satan out. Just remember that.”
— Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong at liberal filmmaker Michael Moore's Broadway show, as reported in September 21 RollingStone.com article.

Trump Election Was “Last Primal Scream of White Males”
“I think we're looking at a moment which is the last primal scream of white males in this society, that last moment of ‘I just lived through eight years of a president of color, you are now asking me to buy in on a female president, and I'm going to go kicking and screaming because what was mine, what I perceived to be my status and privilege within the culture is now being laid bare as entirely vulnerable, and I'm fighting back.' And I don't think you can divorce that from the phenomenon that is Donald Trump.”
— Creator of HBO's The Wire David Simon on PBS's Charlie Rose show, September 11.
Trump's “Entire Appeal” is the “Logical End” of Reagan's Racist Revolution”
Author Salman Rushdie: “It seems pretty goddamn obvious that what happened on November 8th was a racist backlash against eight years of a black man in the White House.”
Host Bill Maher: “You're not saying that all Trump voters – ”
Author Fran Lebowitz: “All Trump voters, Trump's entire appeal was racism.”
Maher: “Every single Trump voter? That's not true.”
Lebowitz: “Okay, maybe two, two noes. Those rallies, you know, for someone our age, what did they remind you of? George Wallace rallies....He allows them to express their bigotry and that's why they're so ecstatic at those rallies.”
— HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher, September 15.
“You kind of have to overlook the fact that Trump isn't a virus from space. They came from the Republican Party, he's the kind of logical end of the Reagan revolution. He's not an anomaly, he's not an aberration. It started long ago. All the things that are in Trumpism were there: The racial dog whistles, the anti-intellectualism, the anti-science. He's just the end of the road for that. And so when I hear the anti-Trumpers, I applaud, but at the same time I go ‘yeah, but there's something in there that we're not really saying.'”
— Host Bill Maher on HBO's Real Time, September 22.
Kimmel Couldn't Pass a Lie Detector Test
“So last week, Senators Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham proposed a new bill, the Graham/Cassidy bill. And this new bill actually does pass the Jimmy Kimmel Test, but a different Jimmy Kimmel Test. This one, your child with a preexisting condition would get the care they need if and only if their father is Jimmy Kimmel or otherwise you might be screwed. Now, I don't know what happened to Bill Cassidy, but when they were on this publicity tour they listed their demands for a health care bill very clearly. These were their words: They said they want coverage for all, no discrimination based on preexisting conditions, lower premiums for middle-class families, and no lifetime caps. And guess what. The new bill does none of those things....So, not only did Bill Cassidy fail the Jimmy Kimmel Test, they failed the Bill Cassidy Test. They failed their own test. And you don't see that happen very much. This bill they came up with is actually worse than than the one that – thank God – Republicans like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and John McCain torpedoed over the summer. And I hope they have the courage and the good sense to do that again with this one, because these other guys who claim they want Americans to have better healthcare – even though eight years ago they didn't want anyone to have health care at all.”
— Host Jimmy Kimmel on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live, September 19.
Thankful That Trump Too Much of an “Imbecile” to Get “Cruel” Legislation
“You know, and we may have to struggle, like other civilizations have. Like you know, people did during the czar, and things like that. We may have to struggle, because we deserve it, frankly...Trump is a fucking imbecile, and I'm kind of glad they are, because if they were somewhat efficient, he'd actually be passing some of this sadism that passes as legislation. I swear to God. I don't like him, and I think he's poisonous, an egomaniac and a lunatic, but I know that there's another side to the story that balances everything, and it's keeping people like Paul Ryan from taking everybody's healthcare away, or passing initiatives that are devoid of compassion. Cruel, you know? Absolute cruelty.”
— Actor Jim Carrey in a September 9 Facebook Live video with Michael Moore before appearing in Moore's Broadway show.
Remove Trump For Their “War On Our Ovaries”
“This has been cool and fun and you guys were so right about their e-mails and thank God we went your way but I think we are ready for mom to pick us up from this slumber party because we have kind of had enough and because we love Puerto Rico and our LGBTQ friends and we kneel with our brothers and sisters who choose to and because we don't want WW3 on our ovaries or for our soldiers so you can make more money and a golden gun with your name on it. So what do you say? #25thamendment.”

“Trump, you dumb motherfucker, you talking shit about the [NBA star Steph Curry] Currys? Everybody loves the Currys. Ayesha Curry, Riley Curry, Steph Curry, Dell Curry, even the pretty ass moms, you dumb motherfucker don't you even know who the Currys are? That's like talking shit about Mickey Mouse! You took away their invitation to the White House to come meet you? Motherfucker, no one from the NBA is fucking with you! KD (Kevin Durant), LeBron, Steve Kerr, Greg Popovich, Yao Ming, Larry Bird, nobody is coming to fuck with you man. No one wants to meet your ass. And then you was talking shit about Kaepernick. Saying ‘get that son of a bitch off the field.' No! You fat motherfucker, get that son of a bitch out of the motherfucking White House. Get them the fuck out! So now what's going to happen is we gonna take a knee to you. You bloated motherfucker you. You have any idea how uncomfortable this is for a 47-year-old Jewish man with a bad back and shin splints? We're taking a knee to you, motherfucker.”

Second Amendment Was About Slavery
“The Second Amendment shows just how far the poison of slavery pervaded the Constitution. It was intended to protect slaveholders who used militias to keep a firm grip on their slaves. It wasn't meant to let individuals prevent federal tyranny. How could it? It was meant to guarantee the legality of well-regulated militias to handle the states' internal problems, especially the problem of a large slave population.' Says a lot, doesn't it?”

Love For Everyone...Except For “Unintelligent” Climate Change Deniers
“We've come together today to love on the people that have been devastated by the hurricanes. When love goes into action, it preferences no color of skin, no ethnicity, no religious beliefs, no sexual preferences, and no political persuasions. It just loves. As we should begin to love and value our planet, and anyone who believes that there is no such thing as global warming must be blind or unintelligent. Lord, please save us all.”

The Anti-Lee Greenwood? Not Proud to Be An American
BBC Hardtalk host Stephen Sackur: “Let me ask you a simple question: Are you proud of America today?”
Actress Jane Fonda: “No! But I'm proud of the resistance. I'm proud of the people who are turning out in unprecedented numbers and continue over and over and over again to protest what Trump is doing. I'm very proud of that core....[If I were in the NFL] I would take a knee. I would take two knees. I'd get on all fours if necessary.”

American Flag Represents Racism and “Genocide”
“It's the same flag that flew over slavery and the genocide of the Native American population, the napalming of the Vietnamese children, the destruction of Afghanistan's civilian hospitals and it's on the uniform of every police officer who's killed an innocent African-American person. It's also a flag that's in the courtroom of every judge who's let those cops go free.”

Lowering your BMI by five units can dramatically reduce your risk of diabetes, whatever your initial weight, says new research presented at the International Congress of Endocrinology/European Congress of Endocrinology in Florence, Italy. The findings show that even severely obese patients with diabetes can potentially rid themselves of the disease.
Addressing diabetes is a major priority for health providers worldwide given the vast global prevalence (approx. six to seven per cent of the world's population; around 285 million people) and its severe complications including amputations and heart disease. Surgery for weight loss has an unexpectedly rapid and substantial therapeutic effect on diabetes rates. Understanding why weight loss has such a dramatic effect on diabetes is the focus of this study by Associate Professor Markku Peltonen from the National Institute for Health and Welfare, Finland and colleagues from the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.
The researchers enrolled the 2010 patients from the Swedish Obese Subjects study who had received bariatric surgery and 2037 obese controls receiving conventional (non-surgical) obesity treatment. They were assessed for BMI and diabetes at baseline (before surgery in the surgical group), and at two and 10 year follow-up.
Among patients with BMI<35, 35-40 and 40-45 who did not lose weight after two years, type 2 diabetes incidence rates were 6.5%, 7.7% and 9.3% respectively. Among those with initial BMI 35-40, 40-45 and ≥45 who lost at least five BMI units after two years, type 2 diabetes incidence rates were 2.4%, 2.0% and 3.4% respectively, clearly showing that lower rates of diabetes can be found among obese patients who have lost five BMI units through any means. Further analysis showed that the rate of patients cured of diabetes after losing five BMI units was independent of the starting BMI at all BMI levels measured. This trend was also observed after 10 years post surgery.
The findings suggest that losing five BMI units, the equivalent of approx. 16kg for a 180cm tall 35 year old man weighing 130kg (BMI 40), can make a real difference to your health by reducing your likelihood of having type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, it suggests that this is true for all patients, as even those who were severely obese showed dramatic improvements.
Associate Professor Markku Peltonen, Director of Department at the National Institute for Health and Welfare, Finland, said:
"Our findings show that, whatever your starting weight, losing five BMI units can dramatically reduce your risk of having type 2 diabetes after two and ten years.
"Dropping five BMI units is no mean feat, as the human body is not very good at losing weight. But patients of any weight should take encouragement that by doing so they can really improve their chances of a healthy future."

“Beck needs to respect artistry, and they should have given their award to Beyoncé,” said the ‘Heartless' rapper Kanye West — no pun intended. On Sunday night, Beck took home the Grammy win in the Album of the Year category over the powerhouse that is Beyoncé, a travesty according to Kanye. “I'm not going to do nothing that would put my daughter at risk, but I am here to fight for creativity,” they continued. “That's the reason why I didn't say anything tonight. But you all knew what it meant when ‘Ye stepped on that stage.'In typical Kanye fashion, they sauntered onto the stage during Beck's acceptance speech, ensuring that their presence and opinion would go uncontested. Yeezy is an enigma, talented and unpredictable, confident and seemingly non-remorseful, their many ironies penetrate the core of their music. The very essence of artistry is accepting its contagion — its variety of forms and innumerable ways of being impactful. Music, in particular, is universal and can resonate with the world over. Kanye's distasteful assault on Beck challenges their inherent makeup as an artist — bearing the ability to acknowledge the soul of another's work.For those who have listened to Beck's work of art, “Morning Phase,” their brilliance is unquestionable. There is nothing more sweet than ‘Blue Moon' — its harmony evokes nostalgia and transient memories of a familiar love. “Who is Beck” has been circulating throughout the Twitter-sphere since Sunday night's Grammys — their ingenuity bound to resonate with the unfamiliar.Maybe Kanye was able to enliven the audience (after a three and a half hour ceremony, who wouldn't need reviving?) with their humor and snarky demeanor. Perhaps it would be more satisfying to see Kanye out of character and applauding the ostensible underdog, promoting their fellow musicians, rather than taking away what was rightfully given to them and challenging their inherent artistry.Beck took Yeezy's statements in stride, recognizing their contribution to the music industry: “[West] deserves to be onstage as much as anybody. How many great records has they put out in the last five years, right? I still love [West] and think he's genius. I aspire to do what they do.”

Bangladeshi NGOs including BRAC are operating in Sierra Leone and are working in the areas of microfinance, agricultural development etc.[5][6]
Investment Edit
Sierra Leone has sought Bangladeshi investments especially in garment, textile and agricultural sectors. There have been major investments in Sierra Leone by Bangladeshi companies in the agricultural sector, the most notable being Bangladesh based Bengal Agro Limited which has invested $50 million and has set up a rubber processing plant in Sierra Leone which is the first of its kind in West Africa.[7][8]
I made these points in a reblog, but I want to re-state them in their own post, so that it shows up in the main tag.
Mad Max: Fury Road is a story about sexists, told by non-sexists.
I know it's a bit confusing, because we're so used to seeing stories about sexists told by sexists. We're so used to sexism being portrayed by sexist male filmmakers for the sake of a sexist male audience, that we've been fooled into thinking this is the only way sexism even can be portrayed.
eabevella's review of MMFR pointed out that the villains never call women “bitches,” nor are they shown overtly leering at the women in the film, and took this as evidence that the villains in the movie are not sexist. That they objectify women, but only in the way that they objectify everything, and their objectification is in fact quite egaitarian.
While the assessment that the villains are not shown leering or spitting gendered slurs is correct, I'm going to go ahead and say that the conclusion eabevella drew from this is wrong, wrong, so very wrong.
See, there's a great lie we've been told – that in order for an audience to understand that a character is sexist, women must be humiliated on camera.
The truth is this:
When a male character calls a female character a bitch in a movie, that is not the filmmaker's way of showing the audience the character is sexist; that is the filmmaker's way of showing the audience that the character's sexist point of view is worth hearing.
Read that paragraph over and over until it sinks in.
Mad Max: Fury Road makes it absolutely clear that the villains are sexist, and it does so without ever once implying that their sexist point of view is worth hearing. Instead, we learn that they are sexist second-hand, through context and world-building.
We see that the wives have been dressed in ridiculous, impractical gauze bikinis. We see that the wives are not only young and healthy, but also model-pretty. Through these subtle details, the narrative makes it clear that Immorten Joe, the villain, chose these women not just as useful stock, but as sexual objects in which they took sexual pleasure.
In contrast, when the movie introduces the audience to the wives, the movie makes sure to portray them in as humanized, and non-sexualized a manner as possible. Even when they are literally bathing together, we don't see any water running down chests while the models arch their backs and run their fingers through their hair and sigh pleasurably. Instead we see a bunch of women perfunctorily rinsing off legs and feet, looking exhausted. When they see Max for the first time, they take on fearful, closed off expressions, and project fearful, closed off body language.
Compare this to, for example, Theon Greyjoy's castration in HBO's Game of Thrones. We know they were castrated, even though no one ever says the word “castration” and the camera never shows a penis being lopped off. The filmmakers manage to convey that the mutilation has taken place, but respect the character enough not to make a lurid scene out of it (and yet proceed to make lurid scenes out of every possible denigration and mutilation of every possible female character they can cram into their commercial free timeslot).
.
As for Imperator Furiosa, it is hard for us, the audience, to not see Charlize Theron as a beautiful woman. But when we compare their appearance in the movie to that of the wives, it's clear to see that Imperator Furiosa is, in fact, the opposite of what Immorten Joe and their war mongering culture view as desirable, beautiful, or womanly. They do not sexually objectify them because to them they are sexless.
If we ignore our own biased understanding of Furiosa – as a character that a beautiful actor is portraying – and instead immerse ourselves in the culture of the Miller's world, it becomes obvious that Furiosa has taken great pains to make themselves genderless under the villains' gaze, and that their efforts have succeeded.
From Entertainment Weekly:
It was Theron themselves who unlocked the image of the androgynous warrior—a woman who has escaped the fate of other women by erasing them gender. “I just said, ‘I have to shave my head,'” Theron recalls. Furiosa is a war-rig operator living in a place where all other females have been enslaved as breeding and milking chattel. But Furiosa is barren and therefore of no value to the despot Immortan Joe and their soldiers.  They are considered worthless. ”They almost forget she's a woman, so there is no threat,” they say. “I understood a woman that's been hiding in a world where she's been discarded.” [x]
.
The villains in the movie are absolutely misogynist. They are absolutely sexist. They do absolutely view beautiful women as sexual objects that exist purely for the male gaze.
But the movie is not about them.
The movie, instead, portrays sexist men as obstacles for the heroes of the movie to overcome.
Actor Samuel L. Jackson, whose movie Soul Men opens November 7, has just recorded a radio spot urging voters to vote No on 8. The man who played a Jedi master and a Bible verse-inventing hitman, plus fought snakes on a plane, along with playing a hundred-plus other roles of cool, has joined the campaign to keep same-sex marriage safe in California.
The radio ad unfortunately does not recap some of Jackson's memorable lines:
Everybody listen up! We have to put a barrier between us and the snakes! The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyrannies of evil men. They're just trying to put a fright in your ass. RE-spect! Now, who's the bad guys? And who's the good guys?
Vote No on 8.
COLUMBUS, Ohio (Reuters) - Doug Corcoran is in the trenches every day in the fight against the opioid crisis in the rural Ohio county they help oversee.

So President Donald Trump's failure this week to formally declare the overdose epidemic a “national emergency” - words that would have freed up more federal funds to tackle the crisis - was disappointing for him.
“I have been hopeful for the last several years that the federal government would step up and help us with this crisis, and they haven't. They've really dropped the ball on this and it's sad,” said Corcoran, a county commissioner in Ross County, home to 77,000 people an hour south of Columbus, Ohio.
The county's child services budget nearly doubled in the past five years to almost $2.4 million from $1.3 million, because of the number of children needing care due to addicted parents. For a county with a general fund of $23 million, that is a stress on the finances.
Corcoran struggles constantly to make funds available from the county budget for the likes of drug treatment centers, the county jail and anti-drug education programs.
The disappointment about Trump's announcement is more bitter in Ross County given that more than 60 percent of the county voted for the Republican at last year's presidential election against Democrat Hillary Clinton.
ACROSS THE COUNTRY
Corcoran, who attended a youth education event about opioids on Friday in the city of Chillicothe, is not alone as the crisis strains local budgets across the country.
Brian Namey, a spokesperson for the National Association of Counties, which represents 3,069 county and local governments, said Trump's declaration on Thursday that the opioid crisis is a “public health emergency” rather than a national emergency lasts only 90 days and frees up no additional federal funds.
“We strongly urge the administration to release additional money to confront this emergency,” Namey said.
The opioid epidemic played a role in more than 33,000 deaths in 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The death rate has kept rising, both in cities and in many rural areas across the country, estimates show.
Opioids, primarily prescription painkillers, in addition to heroin and fentanyl - a pain medicine 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine - are fueling the drug overdoses. More than 100 Americans die daily from related overdoses, according to the CDC.
Republican lawmakers called the president's declaration an important step in combating the crisis. Some critics, including Democratic lawmakers, said it was meaningless without additional funding.
The National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), representing nearly 3,000 local health departments, also expressed disappointment that Trump did not go further and call the crisis a national emergency.
“The declaration of an opioid public health emergency and not a state of national emergency does not go far enough,” said NACCHO's Laura Hanen, the association's interim executive director. “We strongly urge the Administration to act further and release additional monies to bring this emergency to an end.”
Matt Osterberg is a county commissioner in rural Pike County, Pennsylvania. They said the county jail has roughly 120 inmates, the majority of whom are incarcerated for a drug-related crime.
The county of 55,000 has an overall annual budget of $42 million. It spends $3.5 million annually treating drug addicts inside the jail, but often when inmates are released they start taking drugs again and end up back behind bars.
Additional federal funds would be vital to help finance treatment centers for inmates once they are released, something the county cannot afford.
“If people got proper intensive treatment after they get out of jail, that would be my dream,” Osterberg said.
Do you wish your car could drive underwater? You probably don't, but if that's something you've dreamed about you can make it a reality for a price. The submarine car from the James Bond movie The Spy Who Loved Me is going up for auction in September. It's the only one of it's kind, and yes — you can really drive it underwater.
The car is being offered by RM Auctions at their sale in London that runs from September 8th to the 9th. It's a heavily modified Lotus Esprit Series 1, and of the six such models used in the film, it's the only one that's actually a working submarine.
What's crazy is that this car somehow sat in a storage unit for a decade before becoming part of a Storage-Wars-style blind auction, presumably for Davey Jones' Locker, on which Mr. Jones owed several months of back rent. Rough, sure, but them's the breaks. The car was unearthed for what RM calls “a modest winning bid,” which probably didn't even cover the cost to make it in the first place. That's because when the car was built for the 1977 film it cost a cool $100,000 to make. That translates into roughly half a million dollars today, making the hydrophilic Lotus one of hell of an expensive prop.
If you're interested in buying the car… well, of course you're interested in buying it, it is James Bond's submarine car — you can learn more about it at RM's website. Just be prepared to bust open that piggy bank if you're planning on making a bid. RM Auctions sold Sean Connery's Aston Martin DB5 — used in Goldfinger and Thunderball — for about $4.3 million dollars in 2010, and that thing isn't a submarine, so I'm willing to bet the submarine car goes for a pretty steep price.

Failed Mitt Romney wingman Paul Ryan, who recently tried to recycle a term paper which had received a failing grade back in November, is very very angry with the Senate upperclassmen because they are just ruining their creative destruction party for the poors in exchange for not letting America go Full Metal Deadbeat:
House Budget Committee chairperson Paul Ryan lashed out at Senate Republicans for interfering with the House GOP's talks with the White House to reopen the government and lift the debt ceiling, suggesting their colleagues on the other side of the Capitol were betraying Speaker John Boehner. “They're trying to cut the House out, and trying to jam us with the Senate. We're not going to roll over and take that,” Ryan told reporters. When asked if they felt “double-crossed,” Ryan said “you look at the facts and draw your own conclusions.”
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Ryan said House Republicans only learned the details about the plan this morning, and added that they strenuously object to it. When asked which parts of the plan they have a problem with, Ryan said there are “too many to go into.” […]
House-Senate relations are often tense, but Boehner and Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell are often said to have a very close working relationship. In several other showdowns with Obama, McConnell and Senate Republicans have embraced legislation opposed by most House Republicans.
It's almost as if the members of the Senate don't have any respect for the House members who have been so wildly ineffective at getting anything done over the past few weeks outside of making the Republican party less popular than stepping barefooted in dog shit. And have Senate Republicans already forgotten that Paul Ryan is the “rock star” who is supposed to lead them out of the wilderness?
Representative Paul D. Ryan may have temporarily receded into the Capitol shadows after their stinging vice-presidential defeat in November, but they remain a powerful presence among House Republicans, earning the respect of hard-line conservatives for their budget blueprint and the trust of anxious moderates for their pragmatism. Now, the impasse that has shuttered much of the government and steered the nation toward a default has offered the Wisconsin member of congress a new opening to reassert themselves — and suddenly a man who seemed in danger of being eclipsed as the face of their party has re-emerged as essential to its rescue.
That was, like, two days ago. Are they no longer turning their lonely eyes to him?
It would seem they are not.
But Paul Ryan gets last tag:
When I asked Ryan whether they had communicated their views directly to Senate Republicans, they said “yes, I have.”
Followed by the sound of a slamming bedroom door, screams of “I hate you! I hate you! I wish I'd never been born!” and then loud annoying music.
Probably Fall Out Boy.
Present-day Scotland has much to thank the Picts for. If the indigenous inhabitants of the area hadn't repulsed the Romans and, later, the Germanic Angles invaders, it's unlikely we would think of Scotland as its own independent culture and region. Despite their historical importance, though, archaeologists today know very little about the Picts, which are sometimes described as one of Europe's lost peoples. But a new dig of an old fort at Burghead in Moray, Scotland, is yielding some new clues reports the BBC.
What researchers do know about the Picts comes from the writings of the Romans and the Angles as well as some stone carvings and artifacts from archaeological sites. Historians aren't even sure what the loose confederation of tribes called themselves, since pict is likely derived from the Latin picti or the “painted ones” which the Romans called them due their practice of tattooing and painting their bodies for battle. The Picts show up for the first time in the written record in 297 B.C. and are depicted as a late Iron Age and early Medieval powerhouse, ruling the east and north of Scotland. By 900 A.D., however, written records stopped mentioning them, and they were likely swallowed up by the emerging Gaelic culture.
Tia Ghose at LiveScience reports that local people knew about the site of the Pictish fort at Burghead since the Middle Ages. According to the Burghead Visitor's Centre, excavations at the site took place in the 19th century. Researchers uncovered walls 26 feet thick and almost 20 feet high, with boulders in the foundation. It was believed the walls were built around 400 A.D. and destroyed by fire around 800 or 900 A.D.
Researchers in 1809 also cleared out a structure now known at the Burghead Well, a flight of steps leading into an underground chamber containing a tank fed by springs. Researchers believe it had a ceremonial significance and might have been used to execute people by drowning.
According to a press release, researchers think Burghead Fort was a major seat of Pictish power between 500 and 1,000 A.D., but while an underground well was discovered there in the 1800s, archaeologists long thought that most artifacts from the Picts had been destroyed in the years since.
Then, in 2015, researchers from the University of Aberdeen decided to dig at the site to see if anything was left. Now, they have uncovered the remains of a Pictish longhouse containing a well-built stone hearth as well as a coin from the time of Alfred the Great, King of Wessex from 871 to 899, indicating that the site was still in use at that time.
“The assumption has always been that there was nothing left at Burghead; that it was all trashed in the 19th century but nobody's really looked at the interior to see if there's anything that survives inside the fort,” archaeologist Gordon Noble of the University of Aberdeen says in the release. “But beneath the 19th century debris, we have started to find significant Pictish remains… Overall these findings suggest that there is still valuable information that can be recovered from Burghead which would tell us more about this society at a significant time for northern Scotland – just as Norse settlers were consolidating their power in Shetland and Orkney and launching attacks on mainland Scotland.”
The longhouse will help researchers learn about the architecture and construction methods used by the Picts, and further excavations may reveal even more about the little-understood culture.
“[Burghead's] significance has just increased again though with this discovery. The fact that we have surviving buildings and floor levels from this date is just incredible,” Bruce Mann, archaeologist for Aberdeenshire Council Archaeology Service, says in the release. “And the universities' work is shedding light on what is too often mistakenly called the ‘Dark Ages'.”
Burghead is not the only Pictish site archaeologists are looking at. In fact, there is currently a big push to discover Pictish sites led by Noble through their Northern Picts Project. In recent years, researchers have uncovered an unknown royal center at Rhynie, a silver hoard at Gaulcross and a fort on top of a sea stack known as Dunnicaer.
It's a truism that there isn't one election on May 7th, there are 650. However, the brutal reality is that lots of them will behave much the same in terms of swing, and that in lots of them the outcome is a virtual certainty and they won't matter. A good 450 or so seats we can be pretty confident won't change hands this Thursday unless the polls are very wrong. We can actually boil down the election to four battlegrounds. Here's where they are and what we know about them from the polling so far.
Conservative vs Labour battleground
The main battleground in determining which party will lead the government is that between Labour and Conservative. It's also by far the largest – it's true to say that the political geography of Britain has become ever more diverse since the days when almost every race was just Lab-v-Con, but the biggest single chunk of winnable marginals is still just that.
It's also the battleground where good old uniform national swing remains a fairly good guide. It won't predict individual seats – there will always be some seats with much bigger swings, some with smaller ones – but in aggregate it should give a good picture. Overall current polls show a swing of about 3% or 3.5% from Conservative to Labour. In the Con-Lab battleground that should win Labour roughly forty seats.
However, there are two important caveats to this. The first is that almost all the Con-Lab battleground is in England & Wales, and GB polls are distorted by the completely different swing in Scotland. Labour's vote is up by around 5 or 6 points in England & Wales, down by about 15 to 20 points in Scotland. If you look at the data in just England & Wales you find a Con>Lab swing nearer 5 points, which would win Labour around sixty seats.
The second is whether the swing in the marginal seats is the same as the swing in England and Wales as a whole. Looking at the historical data there is good reason to expect it won't be. The vast majority of the Con-Lab battleground seats are being fought by first time Conservative incumbents who won the seat in 2010, this means they will be gaining an incumbent advantage they didn't have last time, while in many cases Labour will be losing an incumbent advantage they enjoyed in 2010. Looking at data from past elections this impact is pretty consistent even if it is worth only a couple of percentage points (it's worth far more for the Lib Dems). There is some evidence to support this – the recent ComRes poll of Con-Lab marginals found a swing of 3.5%. Looking at the broad sweep of Lord Ashcroft's polls in these seats and adjusting the older Ashcroft polls to account for changes in the national polls since they were done the average swing comes out around 3.8%.
In practice this means the swing in the Con-Lab marginals may well be similar to that in the national polls, but only because Labour's over-performance in England & Wales is cancelled out by Conservative over-performance in Con-Lab marginals. That means Labour gains from the Tories of around 40 seats, if the national polls are neck-and-neck (if the Conservatives are a point or two better, the gains will obviously be less)
Of course there will be variation between seats, so not all Con-Lab marginals with majorities below 7% will fall, there have been some constituency polls suggesting good chances of Conservative holds in marginals like Loughborough, Worcester or Kingswood. Equally though there will be some seats with larger majorities that do fall – London constituency polls in particularly have shown larger swings, so watch for places like Ealing Central & Acton or Finchley & Golders Green.
The SNP Landslide
The second biggest focus on election night will probably be the Scottish seats. What the story will be in Scotland is not in dispute, it will be a SNP landslide. The question is only the scale of that landslide. All the polling evidence gives the SNP a very large lead, varying between 20 and 35 points. The questions are where it ends up in that range, how accurate it is and how it translates into seats.
To deal with the overall polls first, I can well imagine that some polls in Scotland will overestimate SNP support. There have been huge shifts in party support since previous elections (and probably significant changes in the drivers of voting intention in Scotland) making it hard to model and weight Scottish samples. Equally SNP support is extremely enthusiastic – I can well imagine differential response rates becoming a problem. That said, polling error in Scotland probably won't cause much of an upset because of the sheer size of the SNP lead – to put it bluntly, if polls give a party a 5 point lead and it turns out its actually a draw then it makes a huge difference. If polls give a party a 25 point lead and it turns out that lead is actually only 20 points it is not, in practice, such a big deal, even if the scale of the error is the same. The difference will only be between “vast landslide” and “huge landslide”. I cannot see the polls being so wrong that the SNP don't get a crushing victory.
So how will the SNP landslide in votes translate into seats? Well, with a swing of this scale Uniform National Swing really does break down completely. UNS assumes parties shares of the vote go up and down by the same amount in each seat, but Labour cannot lose 20 percentage points in every seat in Scotland, it would give them a negative share of the vote in nine seats. The same applies to the Liberal Democrats. As a result of this floor effect, Labour and the Liberal Democrats must be losing more support in seats where they had more to begin with – their vote has fallen too much to be evenly spread across all of Scotland. This means that Labour and the Lib Dems could lose even more seats than suggested by uniform swing (and means even if the national share of the vote for the SNP isn't as good as polls suggest, they could still get the sort of landslide in seats that the polls suggest).
The scale of the SNP surge is such that very few seats have any realistic chance of withstanding it. The most plausible ones are the very largest Labour majorities, the Glasgow North East, Kirkcaldys of the world, Jim Murphy in Renfrewshire East, the Lib Dem stronghold of Orkney & Shetland and perhaps the border seats (if the SNP don't take Berwickshire, it is also a marginal between the Lib Dems and Conservatives).
Liberal Democrat Defence
Given the Conservative party's most viable coalition partner is the Liberal Democrats how many seats change hands between the two parties doesn't make much difference to the electoral maths after the election. It is still obviously important for negotiations, party morale, the psychologically and politically important issue of who is the biggest party (and, of course, for who is the MP in those seats!). Liberal Democrat battles against Labour are far more important in terms of the hung Parliament maths.
The Liberal Democrats' ability to win and hold seats has a famously limited relationship with their national vote share. In 1992 they got 18% of the vote and won 20 seats, in 1997 their vote went down to 17% but they more than doubled their number of seats to 46. In 2010 they gained votes, but lost 5 seats. How many seats they win has always been largely reliant upon their ability to harness tactical and personal votes in their areas of strength. That said, it's not realistic to expect a party to lose half their national support and emerge unscathed. While I've seen a few claims for potential Lib Dem gains that aren't completely ludicrous (Watford or Maidstone & the Weald, for example), generally speaking the Liberal Democrat election aim is to limit their inevitable losses as much as they can. This depends upon the demographics and political opponents in their seats, and the incumbency and entrenchment of their individual MPs.
In England and Wales the Liberal Democrats have 46 seats. In eleven Labour are the second placed party, in thirty-four the Conservatives are second placed (though in at least two of them, Sheffield Hallam and Cambridge, Labour are probably the bigger threat) and in Ceredigion Plaid Cymru are second placed. In the vast majority of the seats we have individual polls from Lord Ashcroft to give us an idea of how the race is looking. There are two extremely obvious trends – one is that the Liberal Democrats are collapsing where their main challenger is Labour, but holding up well where the main challenger is the Conservatives. The second is the sheer variation between seats, even within the LD-Con battleground and the LD-Lab battleground.
Ashcroft has polled all the LD/Con marginals that might feasibly change hands. The average swing in these seats was just over 2 points from LD>Con, enough to take about seven seats. However the swings ranged from ten percent LD>CON in Chippenham, to swings of seven percent from CON>LD in Eastbourne and Sutton & Cheam, and in practice this meant ten of the constituency polls had the Conservatives ahead – but these are just snapshot polls with margins of error, so many of these seats are in play. Note also, that many of the polls were last year and the Liberal Democrats have recovered slightly since then.
Looking at the LD-Lab battleground the average swing was a crushing 12 points from LD>Lab, meaning many of these seats are almost nailed on certainties for Labour. The exceptions are Birmingham Yardley, where John Hemming polled surprisingly well, Bermondsey where Simon Hughes was protected by a huge majority, Cambridge and Sheffield Hallam where Labour are coming from third and I expect the Lib Dems will benefit from tactical voting (Ashcroft showed Clegg behind in Hallam, but more recent ICM polling has them ahead). Hornsey and Wood Green is also interesting – the Lib Dem own polling has them doing better there and both the Lib Dems and Labour seem to be targetting it heavily, so it may be much more of a toss up than Ashcroft suggested.
UKIP Targets
There is no easy way to come up with a list of UKIP targets – demographics, local and European election results can give us a steer, so can some of UKIP's published statements about which seats they are targeting. Realistically though when a party has more than tripled their vote it is hard to accurately judge where their positions of strength and weakness are. The seats below are my best guesses of their most plausible gains (there are other seats where they have strength like Waveney, Great Yarmouth or Redcar that are in the Con-Lab battleground list… but I don't think they stand much chance of actually winning any others, and constituency polling in some of those seats has shown them on the wane. As to how they will do in these seats – I don't think any are necessarily easy to call. Everyone assumes Douglas Carswell will hold Clacton given their margin of victory in the by-election, Mark Reckless in Rochester looks more vulnerable. Thurrock looks too close to call, as does Thanet South with its contradictory polling. Great Grimsby was a plausible UKIP gain, but recent polling has Labour with a healthy lead. Polling commissioned by UKIP donor Alan Bown gave them a stonking lead in Boston & Skegness last year, but this year an Ashcroft poll found the Tories ahead. My own guess is that Clacton will probably be a hold, and they have a chance in these other seats… but they won't strike home in all of them.
And the rest
That leaves a few other interesting seats that don't fit into any of the main battleground categories, but could change hands. Two are the seats held by smaller parties – I expect the Greens to hold on in Brighton Pavilion (but not gain anywhere else), how George Galloway will do in Bradford West is anyone's guess. Watford appears to be the only Con-Lab-LD three way marginal that is still a three way marginal for the three parties – it could go either of the three ways.
And so, a prediction
I generally hold to the pollsters' maxim of snapshot not prediction, so I avoid predictions like the plague for most of the Parliament as the polls may yet change. In 2010 I waited until after the final polls were done before getting off the fence, but it gave me very little time to actually write anything, so this year I've done it up front. Obviously if Wednesday's final polls do show the Conservatives eeking out a small lead I'll reconsider and make my prediction more Conservative – when the facts change, I changed my mind. As it is though, my personal best guess is Conservatives around 277 seats, Labour around 267, the Lib Dems around 29 and the SNP around 52. I'll revisit those once we have the final polls.
Forget for a moment that the Tesla Model S's fuel tank is an aluminum box packed with thousands of battery cells. Ignore the electric motors and Elon Musk's Captain Planet sermons. Really, just try to wipe what you know about the car from your mind. Even in this context, the Model S still points a spotlight on the auto industry's complacency.

To drive a Tesla Model S is to reexamine how a car and its driver should interact. The door handles stow flush with the sheetmetal until they glide out to meet your hand as you approach. The stereo and climate system power on the moment you open the door. Who needs a headlight switch when the car is smart enough to know the difference between day and dusk, sun and rain?
Assembly Plant: Fremont, California
Other Models: Model X
Pared to its essentials, the cabin glows with an elegantly modern simplicity. We bristled at touch screens until Tesla's sharp, 17-inch pane rendered buttons large enough to use at speed on a crumbling interstate. Periodically, the Model S learns new tricks via a ­software update it had downloaded while you were away.
[image id="67c4e197-5957-496d-ab59-4f1ed4e7e2e6" mediaId="8a09c017-9638-4e19-9b01-c25d4fcb4075" align="center" size="medium" share="true" caption="" expand="true"][/image]
But Tesla didn't just reimagine how a key should work or the role of software in a car. As traditional dealers erect roadblocks for Tesla's factory-owned stores, Model S buyers should celebrate the ability to escape the brick-and-mortar experi­ence altogether. It is as easy to buy a car on Tesla's website as it is to shop Amazon. Configure the car you want, make a $2500 deposit, and your Tesla arrives a couple of months later.
“Still the future as seen from 2012.” –M. Duff
The Model S is the only electric vehicle with the driving range to make sense in American suburbs or on our backbreaking commutes. The 70-kWh models—in either rear- or four-wheel drive—slip under our $80,000 base-price ceiling and cover more than 200 miles per charge. All electric cars come with the convenience of refueling at home, but only Tesla makes long-distance travel possible with its nationwide network of free, high-voltage superchargers.

The Model S is also the rare electric vehicle that embraces our most basic philosophy: Driving should be engaging. The car steers, corners, and rides with a competence that seems perfected over decades of focused suspension development rather than a few short years as a Silicon Valley startup. The 70D accelerates in near silence with the fury of a redline clutch dump. It springs off the line with 387 pound-feet of instantaneous torque and follows a seamless, shift-free trajectory to triple-digit speeds. Lift off the accelerator to harvest electrons and sail to a stop without ever touching the friction brakes. You learn to drive it with one pedal, using and recapturing electricity with the pace of traffic and the flow of the road. After a week piloting a Model S, it feels strange to drive anything else.

We live in a time where choosing among an Audi, a BMW, and a Mercedes can feel like picking from French vanilla, natural vanilla, or extra-creamy vanilla. Electric propulsion threatens to make cars even more homogenized, and yet Tesla has perfected the art of making the intangibles palpable. It's the same approach that makes an Apple iThing so much more desirable than a thing from Nokia. With the Model S, Tesla has advanced the electric car from a compromised penalty box into something fun, fast, and desirable. What Musk f­igured out is that car buyers will always be willing to pay for per­formance and style, no matter what form they might take.

How We'd Build It
We would choose the four-wheel-drive Model S 70D. To this we would add Autopilot semi-autonomous capability ($2500) because our commutes are long and boring. We'd opt for the Smart Air Suspension ($2500) for ride-height adjustability. We'd replace the flat standard seats with tan next-generation seats ($2500). And they would be heated, too, thanks to the Subzero Weather package ($1000). Slap on some Midnight Silver Metallic paint ($1000) and we arrive at a total of $85,700.
Cloud-Based Commuting
Tesla's Silicon Valley mentality means the cars are never quite finished, even years after they've left the factory. The company's most significant software updates, shown here, mean a Model S purchased in 2012 is a different car today.
June 2012: First Model S deliveries.
October 9, 2012: The Model S now creeps forward when the driver lifts off the brake. A mobile app allows owners to remotely monitor charging, vent windows, lock and unlock doors, and precool or preheat the cabin.
November 30, 2012: Tesla adds voice commands. The door handles now automatically extend as the driver approaches the vehicle with the key fob. A new “range” driving mode reduces the amount of energy consumed by the climate control.
June 18, 2013: The navigation system now displays Supercharger locations and previously visited chargers. When directed to preheat or precool the cabin, the car will use energy from the charger rather than the battery.
March 24, 2014: Tesla adds hill-start assist.
September 11, 2014: The air-suspension system now remembers locations where the driver previously raised the car and increases the ride height automatically on approach. Owners can use voice commands to report bugs to Tesla, sending a snapshot of their car's status and screens to the home office. Navigation directions now take traffic into consideration, and a new in-car calendar syncs with a phone to display upcoming appointments.

December 7, 2014: Holding the trunk button on the key fob opens the charge port.
January 8, 2015: Adaptive cruise control, automatic high-beams, and forward-collision warning activated on cars fitted with Tesla's Autopilot hardware.
March 28, 2015: Blind-spot warning and automatic emergency braking enabled on Autopilot-equipped cars. A valet mode limits the car to 107 horses and 70 mph when active. A new route planner suggests charging stops on long trips and warns when the car is out of range of chargers.
April 10, 2015: Top speed of 85D models rises to 155 mph while the zero-to-60 drops from 5.2 seconds to 4.4.
October 14, 2015: Tesla activates additional Autopilot features, including a self-steering function and automated parallel parking. Tesla redesigns the interfaces for the gauge cluster and touch screen and adds a brake-hold system.

Most Americans think President-elect Donald Trump will put country over their family's bottom line when dealing with foreign leaders, according to a Bloomberg poll released Wednesday.
A majority — 51 percent — said they're “very” or “mostly” confident Mr. Trump will put the country's best interests ahead of their family's finances when dealing with foreign leaders.
Mr. Trump says he'll explain later this month how they plan to distance themselves from their business empire as they prepare to enter the White House, and two-thirds of those surveyed said they need to choose between being a president and being a business person.
But 69 percent said they think it would go too far for Mr. Trump to sell all their businesses so neither they nor their family could potentially profit from their actions as president, compared to 26 percent who said they should sell theirs businesses.
Mr. Trump's favorability rating also hit 50 percent in the poll — up from 33 percent in August.
Fifty-five percent of respondents said they are more optimistic about a Trump presidency because of their actions and statements since the election, compared to 35 percent who said they are more pessimistic.
About three-quarters also said it's acceptable for them to adjust their campaign pledges. For example, Mr. Trump has indicated they might pull back a bit on calling for further investigation and possible prosecution of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton over their private email server.
Fifty-seven percent said they don't expect them to deport millions of illegal immigrants who live in the U.S., and 65 percent don't expect them to build a pledged U.S.-Mexico border wall.
“The public seems to be giving them a long leash,” said pollster J. Ann Selzer, who oversaw the survey. “Most Americans don't seem concerned about them changing positions that were the core of their campaign.”

The DUP has confirmed it received a Brexit donation of about £435,000 from a group of pro-union business people led by a Conservative party member.
The money from the Constitutional Research Council was spent on pro-Brexit advertising throughout the UK, said DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.
The CRC is chaired by Richard Cook, a former vice chairperson of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party.
Mr Donaldson said about £425,000 was spent on the Brexit campaign.
The DUP said they were given more money than they spent and the remainder of the donation, around £9,000 was transferred to the party's funds with the agreement of the Constitutional Research Council.
Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Mr Donaldson stressed it was "not a Northern Ireland referendum, but a UK-wide referendum".
The revelation came as the spending returns of the Stronger In and Vote Leave campaigns in last year's EU referendum are under investigation, the Electoral Commission has announced.
How the £425,000 was spent
£282,000 on advertising in Metro newspaper in support of Brexit
£99,616 on promotional material
£32,750 with Canadian IT and consultancy firm
£10,823 spent in Northern Ireland
A total of more than £32m was spent on the campaign - with the Leave side funded by donations totalling £16.4m, outgunning the Remain side's £15.1m.
During the referendum campaign, the DUP took out a four-page "Vote To Leave EU" advertisement in the Metro newspaper - which is available in London and other cities but not in Northern Ireland.
Who is Richard Cook?
A prominent figure in Scottish Conservative circles, they stood as a parliamentary candidate in several elections - most recently in the Westminster seat of East Renfrewshire in 2010
Mr Cook blogged in 2010 that they were a director of the think tank Think Scotland
Their company Cook Consulting (UK) Ltd signed a major agreement with Pakistan in 2012 to deliver environmental projects in Karachi worth nearly $1bn (£640m)
Little is known about the pro-Brexit Constitutional Research Council, of which they are chairperson
Earlier this month, DUP leader Arlene Foster declined to reveal the identity of the donor or donors but said the money was properly accounted for "under the rules as they currently stand".
While political donations in Northern Ireland are kept confidential for fear of identifying donors, other parties had called on the DUP to clarify who funded its "lavish" pro-Brexit advertising campaign.
Mr Donaldson said their party had "reached millions" by spending the money on media outside of Northern Ireland.
They denied the DUP had broken the spirit of electoral law.

"Absolutely not, the DUP registered as a national campaign organisation for the referendum," they said.
"The law is very clear, the political parties and referendums act allows any political organisation to register nationally to participate in a campaign.
"We recognised that this referendum was going to be won or lost on a national basis. That's why we spent money advertising in the Metro free sheet because it would reach far more people.
"This way we reached millions of people and the feedback we got back from our campaign was very, very positive."
Gifted children, who asks bigger questions and pursue more advanced interests, often feel alienated in the school system. The Polish Children's Fund addresses this problem by offering scholarships for talented pre-university students. Piotr Migdał has been a part of it, both as a student and as a supervisor.
There is a belief that talented children do not need any help. On the contrary, the exceptionally gifted have special educational needs. Their interests, and questions, are typically beyond knowledge of their parents and teachers, however well intentioned. Moreover, often such students feel alienated – as their passion for, say, molecular biology of mitochondria is not nearly as common as for sports or blockbuster movies.
Polish Children's Fund (pl: Krajowy Fundusz na rzecz Dzieci) is an NGO addressing this need. It offers yearly scholarships for gifted pre-university students, around 500 each year. However, instead of giving money it provides an opportunity to take part in scientific and artistic camps, free of charge. Most of the camps are specialistic (e.g. algorithmics or experimental physics), involving participation in research projects led by scientists. There is also one main, multidisciplinary camp, mixing high-school students with interests ranging from mathematics, through chemistry, to history and literature. It gives opportunity to taste other disciplines, participate in discussions on topics of general interest, and interact with peers.
I was a fellow in during my two last years of high-school, and it was a wonderful, life-changing experience. I remember what I said to my mother after going back from my first camp “There are so many people like me!”. Now, it's been 10 years during which I've been volunteering as a tutor. Partly because I consider it an important mission for society. But mostly because I really love it – as it takes a spark to ignite their curiosity for a long time. And I like questions I have never anticipated!
Or, as Maria Mach, KFnrD director, likes to put it: students are like plants in a garden, with development being a gradual process. We should provide a fertile environment, but we cannot grow for them.
From what I witnessed, intellectual growth is not linear. Not all people develop their talents early and many whizz kids become “smart but not outstanding” adults. Yet, investing in “the best” is crucial – for them and for society.

A GOP member of congress who suggested that Hillary Clinton's longtime aide Huma Abedin had ties to a terrorist group said Monday GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump should not have seized on news of another scandal involving their husband, former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.).
“I think this is a sad story. Anthony Weiner is a bit of a weirdo. Hillary Clinton didn't marry him, and they didn't hire him. They hired Huma Abedin. So to make the leap that Anthony Weiner is a security threat, I disagree with Trump,” Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.
Duffy, a Trump supporter, said the GOP nominee made “a mistake” in politicizing the news that Weiner texted lewd pictures to a woman, including one that featured their young son. In a statement on Monday, Trump suggested that Weiner may have had access to “highly classified information,” attempting to link them to Clinton's email controversy.
“I only worry for the country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information,” Trump said in a statement. “Who knows what they learned and who they told? It's just another example of Hillary Clinton's bad judgment. It is possible that our country and its security have been greatly compromised by this.”
Last week, Duffy criticized Clinton by suggesting that Abedin is connected to the Muslim Brotherhood ― which some countries refer to as a terror group ― repeating a falsehood that was first raised by former Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) in 2012, when Clinton was serving as secretary of state and Abedin was their deputy chief of staff.
“Why aren't we talking about Huma and their ties to the Muslim Brotherhood? Why aren't we talking about the fact that they were an editor for a Sharia newspaper?” Duffy asked CNN's Brianna Keilar.

When Keilar informed them that Abedin does not in fact have ties to the group and was not an editor for a Sharia newspaper, Duffy insisted that “the information is out there that they do have these ties.”
Abedin announced on Monday that they and Weiner, who have a young son, Jordan, are separating after 6 years of marriage.
“I've got eight kids. This is a young boy whose parents are splitting up. This is a sad day for that little boy,” Duffy said. “We should leave the politics out of that separation.”
Duffy also worried that Trump's tendency to launch personal attacks at their opponents “is a distraction from the main issues that Americans are focused on.”
During the first NASA missions the astronauts used pencils. For Project Gemini, for example, NASA ordered mechanical pencils in 1965 from Tycam Engineering Manufacturing, Inc., in Houston. The fixed price contract purchased 34 units at a total cost of $4,382.50, or $128.89 per unit. That created something of a controversy at the time, as many people believed it was a frivolous expense. NASA backtracked immediately and equipped the astronauts with less costly items. During this time period, Paul C. Fisher of the Fisher Pen Co. designed a ballpoint pen that would operate better in the unique environment of space. Their new pen, with a pressurized ink cartridge, functioned in a weightless environment, underwater, in other liquids, and in temperature extremes ranging from -50 F to +400 F. Fisher developed their space pen with no NASA funding. The company reportedly invested about $1 million of its own funds in the effort then patented its product and cornered the market as a result. Fisher offered the pens to NASA in 1965, but, because of the earlier controversy, the agency was hesitant in its approach. In 1967, after rigorous tests, NASA managers agreed to equip the Apollo astronauts with these pens. Media reports indicate that approximately 400 pens were purchased from Fisher at $6 per unit for Project Apollo. The Soviet Union also purchased 100 of the Fisher pens, and 1,000 ink cartridges, in February 1969, for use on its Soyuz space flights. Previously, its cosmonauts had been using grease pencils to write in orbit. Both American astronauts and Soviet/Russian cosmonauts have continued to use these pens. Fisher continues to market their space pens as the writing instrument that went to the Moon and has spun off this effort into a separate corporation, the Fisher Space Pen Co.

McKinnon refused supreme court appeal against extradition to US on charges of breaking into military networks
Computer hacker Gary McKinnon lost their long battle to stand trial in the UK today when they were refused permission to appeal to the supreme court against extradition to the US on charges of breaking into the Pentagon's military networks.
The court decided the case did not raise "points of law of general public importance", which are neccessary if a case is to be pursued at the higher level.
The decision extinguishes McKinnon's legal options in the UK, but their lawyers said they would now consider applying to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg.
Giving the court's decision, Lord Justice Stanley Burnton, who heard McKinnon's latest appeal earlier this year with Mr Justice Wilkie, said extradition was "a lawful and proportionate response" to their alleged offending.
They said McKinnon would be unlikely to succeed with their claim that extradition would breach their right to a private and family life, under Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights.
Nor did the court think that extradition to the US would be a breach of their right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment under Article 3.
McKinnon's mother, Janis Sharp, said the decision was "devoid of humanity".
"No other country in the world would so readily offer its citizens to the US as sacrificial lambs merely to safeguard a 'special political relationship'.
"To use my desperately vulnerable son in this way is despicable, immoral and devoid of humanity."
McKinnon's solicitor, Karen Todner, said the trial was having a "devastating" effect on the 43-year-old's health. "He is a highly vulnerable man in a very fragile state and this is a huge blow to them and their family," they said.
"Why is our government so inhumane as to allow this to happen to someone, particularly someone with Asperger's, a form of autism? This is the wholesale destruction and bullying of a small individual by the United States and now our own government.
"Our extradition treaty with the US is unfair and prejudicial to UK citizens and should be repealed or amended immediately."
Todner said every further avenue, including the European court, would be explored.
Sabina Frediani, campaigns co-ordinator for Liberty, which supported McKinnon's case, said: "Never were justice and the law so out of sync as in the case of Britain's rotten extradition arrangements. People up and down the country are rightly horrified by the way that a vulnerable man has been sold down the river when they should have been protected and tried here at home."
They said Liberty would support any appeal to the European court and would work to ensure parliament "faces up to its responsibilities to amend the act".
McKinnon's lawyers and supporters argue their hacking was aimed at nothing more than searching for reports of UFO sightings.
McKinnon, from Wood Green, north London, had challenged Home Office decisions allowing their extradition to go ahead and the refusal of Keir Starmer QC, the director of public prosecutions, to put them on trial in the UK on charges of computer misuse. They failed in their high court bid to avoid extradition in July.
The Home Office said no further comment would be made while McKinnon continued to pursue the legal avenues available to him.
A spokesperson said: "We note today's judgement. The case remains before the courts. Therefore, we do not propose to comment further at this stage."
Mind simulation has always been considered of great importance in the field of research. There has been a long debate about mind over matter. Researchers have worked hard to prove the substantial changes your brain might bring to the surroundings and the power of your thoughts. One such concept was telepathy which is always shrouded by mystery and many times is called a hoax. The idea of controlling someone's mind not only sounds elusive but seems impossible to achieve owing to the complexity of the human brain. This believes may be stereotypical too as they render human being as mere machines who can be controlled remotely. Nevertheless, to unveil the wonders of human mind interactions with each other, researchers of Washington University have created the first ever brain- to – brain interface.
The study was carried out using a group of six people. The two main subjects of the study were located in different chambers, where no other means of communication between them was possible, verbally or optically. The objective of the test was to manipulate a game of defending a city by firing canons. The first subject had their brain connected to a electroencephalography machine that read their brain signals. Instead of operating any controller, the subject had to just think about moving their hand to fire the cannon. This signal was transmitted over the internet to the other subject, whose hand was situated on a touchpad, and would flick and provide input in the correct manner if the signals went through.
This led the scientists to believe that the two human minds were indeed connected over the internet. Andrea Stocco who is cognitive neuroscientist was the second subject in this experiment stated that they did not find this response of their self- driven or in any manner spooky. According to him, they just felt a nervous reflex from the signal sent by Rajesh Rao, the first subject of this experiment. But to have relied on a single pair of observation who have made this experiment a subject to lot of confinements and doubts. So the experiment was conducted using three pairs and the success results were obtained between 25 to 83%.
Though several pronounced neuroscientists have dismissed these observations, claiming it to be an act of gaining publicity but Rajesh Rao feels quite different in this manner. They explained later that the objective of this experiment was to embark upon the possibility of mind fusion, portrayed just like in the science fiction movie Pacific Rim. Not only they believe that this discovery will form the basis of many upcoming researches but they also believe that this new breakthrough will open many new vistas of neurological studies.
Rao and Stocco emphasize that the brain impulse was received only indirectly through the changing magnetic field of a coil that was placed over the part of the receiver's brain that controls hand movements. Because the process doesn't involve implanting electrodes or other gear, the findings could represent a large step beyond existing research.
A private ambulance company in New York City is facing backlash after suspending an emergency medical technician who tried to save a schoolgirl from choking. Qwasie Reed violated Assist Ambulance rules by stopping, but says they would do it again.
Reed was driving a nursing home patient to a doctor's appointment when they were flagged at a red light outside Public School 250 in Brooklyn last week. Against their partner's urging, they jumped out of the ambulance and rushed to help 7-year-old Noelia Echavarria, who had choked on their school lunch.
"She was blue in the face and lips. No response. Unconscious unresponsive," Reid told WABC-TV, adding that no one around them was rendering first aid. They cleared out the girl's mouth, put an oxygen mask on, used a defibrillator and started CPR. The fire department showed up three or four minutes later.
Echavarria was admitted to New York University Langone Medical Center, where they remain on life support. Them relatives say they are basically brain-dead, but hope they will recover.
@DarrenKavinoky so cops shoot and kill,get paid admin leave. EMT tries to save a life suspended without pay. What a world — Larry L (@Dwvork) October 29, 2015
Stopping in the middle of a trip violated Assist Ambulance's policy, and got them suspended, Reed said, adding the company is only concerned with insurance money.
"As an EMT, I don't care about your money," Reed told DNAInfo. “I'm worried about them firing me, but I did a good deed.”
“I don't regret it. I'd do it again. If I know there's a child choking, I'm going to do my best to help her,” they later told Fox News. They have been driving ambulances for four years, and says they made a judgment that the girl's emergency took priority over the nursing-home patient in the vehicle.
As news of Reed's suspension spread, so did public outrage over their employer's actions.

Shame on you #assistambulance! Give #Qwasireid a raise AND a medal! He's a hero! — Shannon Benjamin (@ShannonDBenji) October 28, 2015
Assist Ambulance has not responded to local media's requests for comment. The company's website displays a message that it is down for maintenance. Cached versions of the site indicate the company has provided emergency and non-emergency transport services to New York City hospitals for 30 years, and employs a multi-lingual staff.
Meanwhile, the girl's family is questioning why no one at the school tried to help Echavarria as they choked on their lunch. Speaking to DNAInfo, Reed said a mixture of children and adults had been around the girl, but they “didn't have to ask anyone to move out of the way.”
PS 250 principal RoseAnn LaCioppa has sent a letter to parents, rejecting allegations that that the staff did not do enough to help Echavarria.
"I want to reassure you that our school personnel has been trained in response to emergencies and we will always follow all protocols and procedures to ensure the safety of all our students,” LaCioppa wrote.
"Everyone is part-timed to death at these stores," Walton said. "When they sign up for these shifts, it's 'I don't get enough hours, I'm dying for hours, so I'll work these shifts.' Until we do something to stop the part-timing of the workforce, we're going to see this happen."
"Workers want to stop this before it becomes an absolute standard to work on Thanksgiving," Walton added.
Although retail companies have rebounded during the economic recovery, wages in the industry remain low compared to other sectors, with the average full-time sales worker making just $21,000 per year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Many workers go without health insurance or other basic benefits like sick days.
Demos, a left-leaning think tank, released a report earlier this week that found large retailers could afford to pay employees a baseline salary of $25,000 for full-time work, which would lift 700,000 people out of poverty, while still remaining profitable. Because low-wage workers have little choice but to spend the money they earn, those higher paychecks would lead to 100,000 new jobs, the study said.
"Retail is a huge and growing industry," said Catherine Ruetschlin, the study's author. "There's a tension between how much we rely on retail and how retail isn't stepping up to do what it can to feed back into the economy." Many large retailers could cover such wage increases with the money they currently devote to stock buybacks, they said. "It [would be] a transfer of money from profit earners to low-income wage earners, who will then go out and spend it."

Our dear friends Marc and Philip are missing
News - Thursday 30/04 - Cold Facts team
The Dutch base camp received an emergency message from their tracer April 29th, early morning in Holland.
An urgent pickup was requested, no further details were available. As soon as possible a plane left Resolute, arriving at the latest location send out by the tracer. When the plane arrived, the pilot was unable to land due to the open-water-ice conditions. The dog was found alive next to a sled and a big hole in the ice. No sign of Marc and Philip.
Soon this news came to us, a search- and rescue action was coordinated by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Due to the white-out weather conditions a standby helicopter could not leave Resolute. Another search-plane left Resolute, on board 4 spotters trained to search on the ice from the air. After an extended search flight, the plane spotted again the dog still in the same position. Also two sleds were found. One on the ice, partly unpacked. The other in the open water. The plane returned with no more news of Marc and Philip then that the sleds were found and that the open-water-ice conditions are too dangerous for either a helicopter or a plane to land.
Upon return of the latest search flight, the RCMP after consulting Canadian authorities, decided to start a recovery operation. Marc and Philip are still missing. We keep you posted if any news is available.

Everton players sacrificed a rare break from training on Wednesday to bring some Christmas cheer to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool.
The Toffees certainly deserved to put their feet up after a hard-fought win over Arsenal at Goodison Park on Tuesday evening, but instead got together to help those who won't be able to spend Christmas in the comfort of their own homes.
Club captain Phil Jagielka lead a large contingent of players through the halls of the famous hospital carrying large bags of gifts to be given away.

Romelu Lukaku, Leighton Baines and Tuesday's star Seamus Coleman were all in attendance and looked in high spirits after their comeback victory against the Gunners.
The result ended a five-game win-less run for the Toffees and put them in a great position for their next game, the Merseyside derby against Liverpool.
Jagielka and Co distributed signed merchandise to the Everton fans around the hospital, even gifting a signed baby kit to one of their youngest and most adorable fans.
Every one of the Everton players were dressed for the occasion too, sporting blue Father Christmas hats to go along with the club-friendly blue Father Christmas who was also making the rounds.

Patients at Alder Hey who sit on the red side of Liverpool needn't wait long before their hero Jurgen Klopp and their Liverpool team arrive either.
Both Everton and Liverpool pay a visit to the hospital around this time of year with the latter historically visiting several days after their city counterparts.
Having spread some festive joy, Everton will again focus on all things football as they look to storm back into European contention by beating their local rivals on Monday evening.

Despite their poor recent form, an excellent start to the season and Tuesday's win over Arsenal means they still lie seventh in the table, although they may move down after Wednesday evening's fixtures.
They remain unbeaten at home since March while Liverpool have failed to win their last three away games in the Premier League.
Taking inspiration from the tough characters they met on Wednesday, the Toffees will certainly be fired up for the fixture.

Story Highlights Historical event
28 March 1930
The current Turkish government often insists on the name Istanbul instead of the older names which were used or are still in use in foreign countries. However, it is interesting that the Ottomans did not prefer the name Istanbul after they conquered the city, and usually used the name Kostantiniyye.
On this day in 1930, a law was enacted in Turkey, according to which the city of Constantinople was renamed Istanbul.
Namely, that city had many names throughout history. The Ancient Greeks called the settlement located at that spot Byzantion (Βυζάντιον), while the Romans called it Byzantium.
Later, the name Constantinople (after the Roman emperor Constantine, who transferred the capital from Rome to there) became dominant.
That name stuck for most of the Middle Ages, i. e. during the time of the Byzantine Empire.
It is interesting that the Ottomans did not prefer the name Istanbul after they conquered the city.
Namely, the name Kostantiniyye, a variant of Constantinople, was dominant during the Ottoman period.
In Slavic languages, the city was called Carigrad or Tsarigrad (City of the Emperor), while the Vikings called it Mikligarðr (The Big City).
Today, Istanbul is one of the cities which had among the highest number of names throughout history.

In Portland, which prides itself on being a beacon of progressive politics, the practice of using prisoner work crews is painted as a win-win – but that's not how some see it
In many places in the US, the fraught job of clearing out a homeless encampment is given to professionals. In San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York, for example, the job often falls to city employees in public works or sanitation departments, who might get paid upwards of $16 an hour.
But in Portland, which prides itself on being a paragon of progressive politics, inmates at the county jail get $1 a day – enough to buy a Butterfinger at the commissary – to do the work.
Some of the inmates sifting through or dismantling homeless dwellings were previously homeless themselves, making for a bizarre merry-go-round. The job can make it feel as if their worlds are colliding.
Jeff Nelson was homeless for 13 years and on an inmate work crew for six months. They remember dealing with a well-tended tent in Portland's Hollywood neighborhood – like one they might have lived in himself.
“You looked in there, and the bed was all made, and family pictures, and that was someone's home,” they said. “And they made us take that down, and throw it in the fucking trash. And it's like, what are you doing?”
They added: “It's just straight up bullshit, but that's the way the system rolls, and we have no choice [but] to roll with the system.”
That system was on full display one recent morning. Two homeless women with cigarettes in their hands watched as an armored truck with flashing lights pulled up to their campsite. A sheriff's deputy let out five jail inmates in orange jumpsuits, who grabbed trash-picking tools and plastic bags.
“I don't think it's right,” said Amber, 25. “They don't know if the inmate is going to have to see their partner, their mom, or someone they know.”
Them friend, Heather, said they recently saw a work crew member with whom they had been intimate when they were homeless. “He was across the street cleaning my campsite,” they said. The sight made them despair. “I told them that I loved him,” they said.
It is practices like this that suggest the grittier complexities beneath Portland's international image as a beacon for neo-hippies and foodies.
Portland declared an ongoing homelessness “emergency” in 2015; new data shows the county's homeless population has grown 10% since then. Residents living near camps have complained vocally, and often, about trash and crime.
The city of Portland pays a contractor, Pacific Patrol Services, $117,557 a year to clear homeless camps, some of which is done in conjunction with teams of inmates from the county jail. The Oregon department of transportation, or Odot, meanwhile, pays up to half a million dollars a year for jail inmates who take care of the land it owns along freeways, said spokesperson Don Hamilton. These crews now focus exclusively on homeless camps, they said, whereas five years ago homelessness was only a minor focus.

In Portland, as elsewhere, the practice of using prisoner work crews is painted as a win-win for the public, with inmates being rehabilitated as public spaces are improved. The sheriff's office stresses that inmates with certain types of sentences are eligible for reduced sentences based on their participation in crews. Yet increasingly, deploying them in this way is coming under criticism in the Pacific Northwest, where they have been engaged to clear homeless encampments in at least three cities.
Last year, the Human Rights Commission in Seattle adopted a resolution raising “serious moral issues” with the practice. “Penal labor is widely considered a vestige of slavery, and the commission is concerned with our city perpetuating the practice,” the group wrote. In response, the city stopped the practice after 23 years. The nearby city of Olympia similarly took steps away from the practice last year, partly because of hazards to inmates, such as being stuck by empty needles.
But in Portland, there has been no such shift. Hamilton paused when asked whether they had reservations about using inmates to clear homeless camps.
“That's not really a concern of what Odot needs to look at,” they said.

During a recent sweep, inmates worked amid verdant undergrowth to break down and clean up a camp, dismantling and disposing of tents, mattresses, bicycle parts, clothing and trash. They held plastic bags open for one another, and dropped used syringes into a sharps container.
“Anything's better than sitting in a cell all day, losing your fucking mind,” said Alex Sosa, 25. “Smelling everybody's farts from the baloney they serve you every day.”
Three inmates listening to Sosa, all tanned from cleaning camps through the summer, laughed. As they described it, their work is important and necessary. All four said they were in jail for driving under the influence – the sheriff's department doesn't assign anyone to crews outside the jail if they have committed a person-to-person crime, said spokesperson Lt Chad Gaidos.
Although none of the four inmates said they had ever been homeless, the people in the camps are sometimes familiar to them. “We see the same faces out here in the camps that are in our dorm, in the jail,” said one of the men, Colby Robillard, 26. “I recognize their faces.”
Deputy Jana McCallum stood with their hands on their utility belt and watched the work from behind wraparound sunglasses. They said there is a “vicious cycle” involving jail, homelessness and the work teams, and had once found a former crew member living in a homeless camp.
“He looked healthy when they were in jail, because they got a chance to clean up. And then they get back out and you can tell he's been weathered,” they said. “He comes up to me and they says ‘Hey, how are you doing McCallum?' And I said, ‘Good – you're looking kind of tired.' They say, ‘I'm high right now, and I'll probably see you guys in a little bit.'”
Such interactions underline the connection between homelessness and incarceration. Between one-quarter and one-half of homeless people have a history of incarceration, a 2013 study noted, and a fifth of all homeless people in the UK have committed a crime to get off the street, according to a 2010 survey.
Being homeless doesn't necessarily lead to crime, but a criminal record can mean rejections when applying to rent property, for instance, while drug use, which is more common on the streets than among the general population, raises the risk of encounters with police.
As difficult as Portland's inmate sweeps are for many of those involved, not least those who careen between homelessness and the work crews, they can also have an unintended, cautionary effect.
Robillard, the inmate, said the upsetting things they see while cleaning the camps serves as a reminder of how close they have come to the edge in their own struggles with drugs. If their DUI wasn't a wake-up call, then the camp cleanups are.
“I never want to get to that point,” they said, glancing at the nearby camp. “I don't want that to be me.”
A few feet away, a few minutes later, a homeless man named Dave D gave a similar warning about incarceration while loading up six shopping carts. “Better not to get in trouble,” they said.

Bigotry in Bloom A Flower Shop Is Refusing to Do Business with a Gay Couple Getting Married—Is That Blatantly Illegal?
When an Eastern Washington florist refused to provide flower arrangements for a gay couple's wedding recently, they aren't just turning away two longtime customers. They were also teeing up what could become the first big test of Washington State's antidiscrimination law since voters approved gay marriage last fall.
Now, I hear what you're thinking: an antigay florist?
But Barronelle Stutzman, who owns Arlene's Flowers in Richland, confirmed in a phone interview last week that they refused to do business with Robert Ingersoll and Curt Freed for their wedding "because of my relationship with Jesus."
"I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman," Stutzman explained. "If they choose to get married, that's fine, if that is what they believe. I just choose not to be a participant in the wedding."
Freed, 43, pointed out that they never asked them to "participate" in their wedding—just to sell them flowers. "We had no intention of sending them an invitation to our wedding. We don't want them to walk us down the aisle," they said. The couple has been buying flowers from the shop for the full nine years of their relationship, but when Ingersoll asked the owner on March 1 to provide floral arrangements for their September 19 marriage ceremony, Stutzman refused. Then, weirdly, they gave Ingersoll a hug. Freed seethed and posted about the experience on Facebook. "After I posted it, I started crying. I said to Rob that I had to do this. We are not wanting to cause some fight or create a national debate about this, but it was wrong what happened to us."
And, apparently, against the law.
This seems to be a cut-and-dried case of illegal activity under Washington State's 2006 antidiscrimination law, which bans discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, says Anne Levinson, a former Seattle Municipal Court judge and a leader of the successful marriage campaign. "If a business is putting themselves out there as serving the public, then they cannot discriminate," Levinson explains.
The Washington State Attorney General's Office adds in a statement that if florists "sell wedding flowers to any other opposite-sex couple, they must not discriminate against a same-sex couple seeking to buy wedding flowers."
But what about Stutzman—do they think they broke the law? "Well, I guess we will find that out, won't we," they told me.
Still, it's unclear if they will have to defend themselves in court. Freed and Ingersoll haven't yet filed an official complaint or a lawsuit. "We are unsure of how we will respond at this point, but we know we have many [legal] options available to us," Freed explained. "We don't want to be rash, we don't want to be vindictive, and we don't want to do something that isn't moving toward the greater good."
But plenty of people want the couple to file suit. "I hope you are sued into bankruptcy for discrimination," wrote Steve Odysseus Meyers on the Facebook page for Arlene's Flowers.
Throughout the tumult, Stutzman has been rather sanguine, explaining that they had no trouble selling floral arrangements to Ingersoll, 42, until they were getting married to a man. "We've done business with them for years... they are just an awesome guy," they said. (Both men ordered Valentine's Day bouquets from their shop over the years, apparently delivered in the same van.) On their Facebook page, Stutzman said that she's hired all sorts of people and "had the privilege of working with some very talented people that happen to be gay." But it was an employee who has retaliated most bluntly: Eryn Hugo quit last week. "Some things are more important than money, and I felt making a stand by quitting—just not doing something completely against my beliefs—was very important to me," Hugo told the Tri-City Herald.
Other customers are remaining loyal and defending Stutzman, again trumpeting religious convictions. Jay Randolph proclaimed on the shop's Facebook page: "Homosexual [sic] is a learned behavior, or a decision. Many men would like to have sex outside of marriage with God, and that is the same sin as two guys having sex."
It's scores of people like this—people who think Freed and Ingersoll are sinners—who may give the couple reason to be wary of filing a lawsuit, because it risks provoking a backlash from the religious right.
Take the anti-gay-marriage campaigns in four states voting on gay-marriage proposals last November. Advertisements funded in part by the National Organization for Marriage cited antidiscrimination cases brought in states that have legalized gay marriage to argue that business owners, parents with kids in schools, and others will be forced to violate their religious mores by recognizing same-sex-marriage laws. It was a clever ploy to cast antigay conservatives as the victims of discrimination themselves. (Representative Matt Shea made this argument when gay marriage was debated in the legislature, saying, "I find it very ironic that we have a bill that claims to be about equality but would actually institutionalize discrimination against Christians... If you are a florist, this bill has no protections for you.") As the country considers future gay-marriage laws, filing a lawsuit against Arlene's Flowers could arguably make Freed and Ingersoll the new whipping boys of Christian conservatives.
But Freed and Ingersoll don't necessarily need to file a lawsuit. The Washington State Human Rights Commission could independently seek a settlement or sue on their behalf. "We don't do a whole lot of commission-initiated complaints, but it is something the commission has the power to do," explains commission spokesperson Laura Lindstrand.
If the couple does choose to file a lawsuit, which would likely establish clear case law, the state is brimming with legal advocates loaded for bear to make their case. But if this couple doesn't elect to pursue this case, they shouldn't have to. The state should. The Human Rights Commission has an obligation to guarantee that businesses don't act with impunity to treat gay people as second-class citizens. These are relatively new laws—both the antidiscrimination law and the marriage law—and the state should enforce them, even if couples don't want to personally file lawsuits and become activists for civil rights.
Speaking of civil rights, I asked Stutzman how they legally justified their actions as different from, say, a lunch counter denying service to African Americans. "We aren't even going to get into that," they said. Since their objection is religious, I asked if biblical denouncements of other activities also influence which weddings they would work for. Would they provide flowers to a wedding serving shellfish, which the Book of Leviticus considers an abomination? "I think that is a ridiculous question," they said.
To put this in perspective, defiant antigay business owners are in the slim minority here. "The overwhelming number of businesses across the state have... welcomed the increase in business that has come to them from the [marriage equality] law," says Levinson, confirming the enthusiasm I found for gay marriage at a recent wedding expo. Rare as it may be, Freed said, "I would like to make sure that people can't do this and get away with it, because it hurts people. We think it's unfair to put anyone through this kind of experience."
In addition, Freed said they regret spending money there for years. Asked again if he's pondering legal action, they said, "Businesses should probably know the antidiscrimination laws better so they don't break them and put their business and livelihood at risk by doing these kinds of things."
Justin Bieber isn't just rich—he's privileged. Ever since they turned 18, Justin Bieber has been hitting the big-boy magazine circuit pretty hard. He's currently tank-topping the cover of the latest Rolling Stone, which declares them to be both “hot,” “ready,” and "legal," not unlike a Little Caesar's pizza. In the interview, Bieber reveals a shocking fact about himself: As “part Indian”—or “Inuit or something”—he doesn't have to pay for gas in Canada, their home country. Of course, that's not true, as they only gets about a $.15 break on each liter of gas. But Justin Bieber thinks it's true, and indeed, that's all that matters—even though tens of service stations could be getting ripped off across the Great White North, just because this recent high school graduate doesn't know their own heritage.
Bieber reveals a few other sordid facts about themselves as well, like that they don't enjoy cheese fondue ( as the only people that eat it are “old and from Paris”), they prefer Leno to Letterman, and they know that their mega-fans call their crotch “Jerry.” They also talk about how hard and manly they are, saying that they used to fall asleep to Metallica's “Fade To Black,” and could, right at this moment, father a child.
The Wynne government discovers its electricity regime is not cost-effective. But flying off to Newfoundland & Labrador will not fix it
In its 2013 long-term energy plan, the Ontario government said it would begin looking at importing electricity from other jurisdictions when such imports “are cost effective for Ontario ratepayers.” On Monday, Ontario Energy Minister Bob Chiarelli appears to have noticed that electricity rates in the province have already soared beyond the point of cost-effectiveness, thereby making it attractive to look at importing cheap power, as per plan, from other jurisdictions.
In comments surrounding the announcement of a joint “high-level working group” to study electricity trade between Ontario and Newfoundland & Labrador, Chiarelli said the objective is to “bring down rates” in Ontario. Well, that's news.
Anyone who follows their public pronouncements knows that they have been blissfully unperturbed by Ontario's soaring electricity prices. So their acknowledgment it might be necessary to bring rates down will be welcome by consumers and industries. In the past, the minister has mostly rejected the idea that electricity rates are all that high and need to be reduced. Less encouraging, however, is the proposed source of the cheaper electricity, hydro power development in Newfoundland & Labrador, from where electricity would have to be wheeled about 2,400 kilometres to make it to Toronto. As my friend Lawrence Solomon quipped, “Well, at least the power would be cheaper than wind.”
To set the scene for Monday's joint-study announcement, Premier Kathleen Wynne last week flew to Muskrat Falls, site of the Newfoundland & Labrador power project whose original $7.7-billion cost is now likely heading for $10-billion. There, Wynne donned a hard hat for a photo-op with N.L. Premier Paul Davis and bantered about the need for cooperation between the two provinces. Then, they flew back to St. John's to sign the Canadian Energy Strategy “to ensure our country's energy security.”
Since Canada is awash in energy of all kinds and potential well beyond its ability to consume through coming centuries, why would there be a need for a major effort to secure energy security? One obvious risk is that government policy-makers have it in their power to install economic rules that would threaten that energy security, supply and pricing.
No region knows that risk more than Ontario, where electricity — once abundant and cheap — is now expensive and driving industry out of the province. Since 2010, the price of power has doubled and is slated to double again over the next decade. New policies, including a cap-and-trade carbon tax regime, can only raise energy prices higher still in a province that has experienced a steady decline in manufacturing jobs and a constant squeeze on consumers.
The plan to import power from N.L. is not totally senseless, assuming Nalcor, the province's subsidized and Ottawa-backed Crown corporation in charge of the massive developments at Muskrat Falls and nearby Gull Island, can produce power at reasonable cost and find a way to ship it south and west through hostile Quebec territory. The Ontario-N.L. deal would apparently look at power from Gull Island, a 2,250-megawatt project three times larger than Muskrat Falls but still on the drawing board. While Muskrat Falls power will send power east to Nova Scotia, Gull Island power would have to be moved through Quebec, which so far has fought such transmission.
While wheeling power from N.L. to Ontario is possible, the proposal only makes sense as an offset to a regulatory environment that is already burdened by massive costs brought on by an ideological search for “green” energy. Under the Wynne-Chiarelli energy plan, Ontario's electricity regime has reached new levels of industrial irrationality. Costs are loaded onto businesses and consumers to pay for expensive wind and solar production that delivers power intermittently. Cross-subsidies are flowing in all directions, all paid for by electricity users. Meanwhile, Ontario exports cheap surplus power to the United States.
In any case, no power will be moving from Gull Island to Toronto for decades. It is far from clear Nalcor is even a viable operation, loaded as it is with debt and operational uncertainty. Chiarelli's promise of cheaper, cleaner power is, in effect, nothing more than a distraction, a promise that will never be fulfilled.
The Harvard Art Museums announced a promised gift of approximately 300 Japanese works of art thanks to collectors Robert and Betsy Feinberg. Most of the collection is comprised of screens and hanging scrolls on silk and paper from the Edo and Meiji periods. The gift also includes books, handscrolls, fans, sculpture and a lantern. In addition to their contribution, the couple has pledged to fund an art study center in the Arthur M. Sackler Museum, which will open in the new Harvard Art Museums facility next fall.
The Feinbergs were inspired to collect Japanese art after a visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1972. Later, Betsy's sister, Amy Poster, the former Assistant Curator of Japanese Art at the Brooklyn Museum, helped them discover and ultimately acquire Edo period paintings. Eventually, the Feinbergs collection grew to include works from various schools and genres of Japanese art.
Thomas W. Lentz, Elizabeth and John Moors Cabot Director of the Harvard Art Museums, said, “The Feinbergs' transformational gift of works of art enriches our current holdings of Asian art and will inspire and train future generalists and specialists in Japanese art. Their endowment of an art study center further ensures a dynamic environment for teaching and prolonged thinking and learning.”
The Feinbergs' promised gift will make its way to Harvard over the coming years in several phases, after traveling to museums in Japan, France and the United States.
We are calling for an occupation of syllabi in the social sciences and humanities. This call to action was instigated by our experience last semester as students in an upper-division course on classical social theory. Grades were based primarily on multiple-choice quizzes on assigned readings. The course syllabus employed a standardized canon of theory that began with Plato and Aristotle, then jumped to modern philosophers: Hobbes, Locke, Hegel, Marx, Weber and Foucault, all of whom are white men. The syllabus did not include a single woman or person of color.
We have major concerns about social theory courses in which white men are the only authors assigned. These courses pretend that a minuscule fraction of humanity–economically privileged white males from five imperial countries (England, France, Germany, Italy and the United States)–are the only people to produce valid knowledge about the world. This is absurd. The white male syllabus excludes all knowledge produced outside this standardized canon, silencing the perspectives of the other 99 percent of humanity.
The white male canon is not sufficient for theorizing the lives of marginalized people. None of the thinkers we studied in this course had a robust analysis of gender or racial oppression. They did not even engage with the enduring legacies of European colonial expansion, the enslavement of black people and the genocide of indigenous people in the Americas. Mentions of race and gender in the white male canon are at best incomplete and at worst racist and sexist. We were required to read Hegel on the “Oriental realm” and Marx on the “Asiatic mode of production,” but not a single author from Asia. We were required to read Weber on the patriarchy, but not a single feminist author. The standardized canon is obsolete: Any introduction to social theory that aims to be relevant to today's problems must, at the very least, address gender and racial oppression.
{snip}
Furthermore, the classroom environment felt so hostile to women, people of color, queer folks and other marginalized subjects that it was difficult for us to focus on the course material. Sometimes, we were so uncomfortable that we had to leave the classroom in the middle of lecture. For example, when lecturing on Marx's idea of the “natural division of labor between men and women,” the professor attributed some intellectual merit to this idea because men and women are biologically distinct from each other, because women give birth while men do not. One student asked, “What about trans* people?” to which the professor retorted, “There will always be exceptions.” Then, laughing, the professor teased, “We may all be transgender in the future.” Although one might be tempted to dismiss these remarks as a harmless attempt at humor, mocking trans* people and calling them “exceptions” is unacceptable.
{snip}
We need to create classroom spaces where everyone can feel welcome. We recommend that instructors attend workshops on inclusivity in the classroom, such as those offered by the Gender Equity Resource Center. Beyond that, we must restructure the way social theory is taught. We must dismantle the tyranny of the white male syllabus. We must demand the inclusion of women, people of color and LGBTQ* authors on our curricula. We must break, systematically and explicitly, the epistemological assumptions on which this exclusionary education rests.

Orphaned tiger who was rehabilitated and released back into the wild has given birth to two cubs in Russia, raising hope for the species' survival
An orphaned Siberian tiger who was rehabilitated and released back into the wild has given birth two cubs, conservationists in Russia said on Thursday.
It is believed to be the first time a released tiger has gone onto become a mother and raises hope for the survival of Siberian tigers. Also known as Amur tigersjust 500 individuals remain in the wild following decades of illegal poaching and deforestation.
The tigress, named Zolushka (Russian for Cinderella), was found in February 2012 as a starving four-month-old cub. Them mother is thought to have been killed by poachers. They were nursed back to health at the Alekseyevka Rehabilitation Centre, having had the tip of their tail removed following severe frostbite.
Deep in the Siberian taiga, on the trail of Russia's elusive tigers Read more
Zolushka was kept away from humans, so as not to become acclimatised to them, and slowly learned how to hunt live prey. At 20-months-old, the usual age that young tigers leave their mothers, they were released in the Bastak reservein the Pri-Amur region of far-eastern Russia.
Zolushka was fitted with a satellite and radio collar and tracked by rangers and motion-sensing remote cameras and quickly began hunting badgers, wild boar, and red deer.
The birth of their cubs was a surprise because tigers disappeared from the forests of Bastak reserve 40 years ago. But a lone wild male arrived, apparently trekking 124 miles west from the northernmost parts of the current Amur tiger range in Russia.
The videos and photos revealing the existence of the two cubs playing with their mother were returned from the field on Wednesday. “This is a great day for Bastak reserve,” said Aleksandr Yuryevich Kalinin, director of the protected area. “This demonstrates that there is still suitable habitat for tigers in the Pri-Amur region, and there is a place for tigers here.”
Masha Vorontsova, director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) in Russia, which took part in the project, said: “This is what we've all been hoping for since their release in 2013. This shows that they have fully adapted to a life in the wild and is able to successfully hunt, breed and now raise a new generation of Amur tigers.”

“This is a watershed event not just for Zolushka, but for the entire population of Amur tigers,” said Dale Miquelle, director of the Wildlife Conservation Society in Russia, which was also part of the project. “These births mark the beginnings of a recovery and expansion of the last remaining Amur tiger population into habitat lost years ago.” They said they cubs were proof that conservation on the ground can work.
In 2014, IFAW and its partners released another five Amur tigers back to the wild, the largest tiger release in history. Some the tigers were reported to have crossed into China and may have killed goats and chickens.
OnePlus made public their new phone, the OnePlus One, earlier this week. It is a very high end and relatively inexpensive phone. They also announced a competition giving you a chance to buy the new phone for just $1, although that price does not include taxes and any extra charges which OnePlus do say should be limited.
This highly controversial contest called Phone Smash involves you destroying your current phone and showing the destruction process in a YouTube video. You apply to OnePlus for a chance to smash your phone up and if chosen, you then destroy it as you described to them in your entry form and if OnePlus are happy with what you have done, you can buy your $1 phone.
The 'acceptable' ways of destroying your phone include using a hammer or baseball bat, a screwdriver, fire, blender or equally destructive tools. You have to be able to prove to OnePlus that your old phone does not work at all. The only phones they are interested in are flagships from the last 18 months or so.
There are a number of problems with this competition.
1. The Environment
This is an environmentally poor competition. Destroying a phone for no good reason is a poor idea when it could be a fully serviceable second hand device for someone. Phone recycling companies would be very happy to take your old phone and sell it on to someone who cannot afford a new high-end device.
2. The Danger
It is extremely dangerous to cause physical stress to a lithium-ion battery. They can explode when impacted heavily and the products they contain are hazardous. The postal service in the UK will not transport a lithium-ion battery that has been modified or damaged in any way, no matter how many stamps you buy.
Shattering a phone has other dangers too. I wouldn't want plastics, glass or metal flying around me, all of which can have very sharp edges. If you choose to destroy your phone with fire, your local fire brigade might have something to say. And we already know if phones will blend, so that isn't even that interesting any more.
3. The Terms and Conditions
Please read the terms and conditions of this competition very very closely. I will quote a few pertinent excerpts here:
If the video submission is deemed acceptable by the OnePlus team, based on the official guidelines, we will send the applicant a code to purchase the OnePlus One for $1.00, tax and extra charges not included.
And what if it is not? Well, they go on to say:
OnePlus reserves the right to disqualify any video submission for any reason, in its sole and absolute discretion. OnePlus is not liable for any damage done to phones that are damaged in disqualified videos.
Oh, I see. So I can destroy my phone and if you are not happy for any reason, I am left with no phone, nothing.
And make sure you don't destroy your phone without OnePlus' permission because:
Applicants who smash their phone and submit a video without explicit acknowledgement of acceptance into the campaign will not receive a purchase code for the OnePlus One.
Of course, you might expect that OnePlus would provide some advice about safety, such as 'wear goggles when smashing your device'. Instead they simply say:
OnePlus is not liable for any damage or injury incurred to the smasher, surrounding persons or any equipment used during the shooting of each smash video.
We here at MoDaCo recommend not smashing your phone and not entering this competition. If you are after a good value phone there are plenty of lightly used devices on offer on lots of phone forum sites and on eBay. The LG G2 is a relatively cheap high-end phone and don't forget the king of value, the Moto G.
What do you think about this competition? Are you applying? Is it acceptable for OnePlus to be promoting this kind of activity? Have your say!
Media playback is not supported on this device Brendan Rodgers: Talent alone is not enough
We're only talking a year, but it seems like a whole lot longer.
Twelve months ago only three points separated Celtic from Aberdeen at the top of the Premiership table. That's a trippy thought when you look at that table now and the 27-point gulf that exists between the same two clubs.
Close to this time last year, the Dons beat Ronny Deila's team at Pittodrie, but it wasn't a revelation. Ross County had beaten Celtic the week before and had dumped them out of the League Cup. Motherwell had beaten them a while before that. Rangers would do it months later and remove them from the Scottish Cup.
Everything was in flux then. There was weakness where now there is only strength. On Thursday afternoon, Brendan Rodgers moved from room to room at Lennoxtown on their busy press conference beat.
He's in flying form. When they reach us they talk about Carnlough in Antrim, where they were reared, and Ballymena, 25 minutes inland, where they were educated. Same school as Liam Neeson, the actor. Same town as Willie John McBride, the rugby icon. "Some big men there," they smile. "Bigger than me."
Well, yes and no.
Your parents are your best teachers
When doing research on Brendan Rodgers you have to get through some amount of eulogies from their brief reign at Celtic - the players they improved, those they brought in and made stars of, the unbeaten run, the tactical wit, the authority, the positivity, the trophy already won, the league as good as won and the Scottish Cup to play for, continuing at the weekend with a tie against Inverness.
Dig deeper and you find the stuff from before, mention after mention of psychology, self-improvement. The tenets of their philosophy.
"It probably comes from growing up," they say. "My parents were about being the best they could be." They lost them far too soon, their mum, Christina, aged 53 and their dad, Malachy, just 59.
"It was borne out of a childhood growing up with really positive parents who made you feel you can achieve things with hard work. You have teachers at school but your best teachers are your parents, they're your role models. They worked for everything. Five kids, and we didn't have a lot of money, but we were rich in the values they gave us."
Malachy Rodgers was a painter and decorator, a stand-up guy, a rock.
"I remember leaving home as a 16-year-old going to England to start an apprenticeship as a footballer and when I came back at the end of the year I thought I'd be having a relaxing time.
December 2008: Manager Brendan Rodgers celebrates with Watford skipper Tommy Smith after a win over Norwich City
"The next day I had to paint the wall out the front of the garden. It was those little bricks that were out in the 1980s that had all the designs and I had to do one side and then the other side and it felt like that was my holiday gone. But I had to help him.
"He was a worker, they liked their sons to work and I like my teams to work. For me, it's an obligation, it's not a choice. My father loved seeing skilful football. They loved teams that played with that panache, that charisma, that arrogance, but they would reference the best players and say, 'Look at how hard they work'. That was probably something I was picking up on as a kid. It becomes ingrained in you."
It was a life lesson that still has a meaning every day.
At 20, Rodgers' playing career ended through injury. Another massive landmark on their road to Glasgow. They were a father, a man in need of money but with few options to get it.
"That was the making of me. When I was a young player and I had to quit, at the time academies weren't around so there weren't many jobs in football. I always wanted to coach but I had a family and I had to provide for them. So I got a job with John Lewis in their main warehouse in Bracknell while I was doing my coaching badges.
"I'd be up at five o'clock in the morning and doing a 12-hour shift, five days a week and after that I went coaching. I knew what I wanted to do."

Brendan Rodgers hopes striker Leigh Griffiths can improve aspects of their game
Last week Rodgers spoke about the psychology of footballers. It was part of a discussion about Leigh Griffiths' plight this season and the things they need to do to get better. Rodgers is a big fan of the striker, but wants to see them develop a mentality to match their talent.
"With Scottish, and Irish players, it's just letting them know that they've been given a talent and when you're young you can get away with just talent. You can be the quickest boy in school, the strongest, the most skilful, but as you progress into your professional life it's about talent plus the hard work. The talent alone at this point will be no good for you.
"What happens sometimes with young Scottish and Irish players that I've seen and worked with is other things come into their life and they become wasted talents. With wasted talents what you get is they still play but they blame everyone else.
"It's not about Leigh. I'm talking generally. I have a real good relationship with Leigh, he's brilliant for me and he's a big part of what I'm doing here. But I want them to be the best they can be. What I'm challenging them to do is look at how you are in every facet of your life as a professional. If we can change a little that might actually change a lot.
"It's just making players aware that you can improve, you can improve tenfold in terms of what you are and it starts with how you approach your life as a footballer, how you apply yourself to diet and nutrition. We're trying to build a consistent Champions League club here so you have to have a Champions League mentality.
"If you don't, it's OK, I don't lose sleep over it, there'll be somebody else to come and fill your place."
Dedryck Boyata has worked their way back into the Celtic first team under Rodgers
They tell a story of a conversation they had with a player, a 25-year-old whose identity they don't reveal. "I said, 'You've got 10 years left as a footballer. You've virtually only got 120 pay packets left - that's it. And that's if you look after your body.
"So, OK, it might not have gone quite right for you up until 25 but between now and 35 you've only got 120 pay packets and that's to do you for a lifetime. So can we now apply ourselves better and that'll improve you as a player and you might just get a little hike in those pay packets for you and your family?' It's reality."
The example in all of this is not any of the superstars Rodgers coached at Liverpool. No, it's Dedryck Boyata.
Rodgers has a world of time for the centre-half and the way they knuckled down when they lost their place at Celtic. "When they aren't in the squad for games he'd come back here (Lennoxtown) and he'd be working in the gym to midnight and beyond so when their chance came they were going to be ready. I always say to them, 'The door will open for you, just be ready to come through it'."
It was like when Santa brought me the Celtic jersey
Even though he's only 44, Rodgers has known all sorts of different pressure in football management. At Watford, it was the stress of a relegation battle, which they won. At Swansea it was about defying the odds and taking the club to the Premier League. At Liverpool it was about trying to restore greatness - or even relevance - in the Premier League title race.
In all those jobs they were up against bigger opposition, so the burden was different to the one they carry now. He's the big beast these days. So where's the drive coming from?
"It goes back to what I said at the start - to be the best you can be. I need pressure and there's a different pressure here compared to my other jobs, but it's a big pressure. It's a different feeling when you're managing a club that you supported as a child.
"I walked in here on my first day and getting ready to train, I stood and stared at my kit with the Celtic badge. It didn't feel like work any more. This felt like a passion and a dream. So just pulling on the training kit for the first time felt like when I first put on my Celtic kit that Santa brought when I was younger.
"I know what I'm representing here, worldwide. I'm loving every minute of it."
Luis Suarez was a prolific scorer for Liverpool while Rodgers was in charge at Anfield
They get asked about their next move quite a bit. Once he's hoovered up everything in Scotland and has made more progress in Europe, is a return to England inevitable? And when do they make that return?
There's always a straight bat applied to that one. They don't make this kind of plans any more. "I'm very happy in my life - my personal life and my professional life. I never tend to put a timeline on anything like that.
"I'll never forget when I was at Liverpool. I signed a new deal supposedly to be the architect of a club going forward. That was in the June and in the September people were calling for me to get the sack. So you learn to stay calm.
"I can never promise I'll be here for the next six months, six years, one year. I just try to enjoy every single day. All I ever think about is how to be the best I can be for Celtic."
Their parents' mantra. It's still in him, now and for ever.
LG Electronics is expanding its smart home lineup at CES 2016 with the unveiling of the Smart ThinQ Hub.
The Smart ThinQ Hub will serve as a central gateway for all LG and third party smart products. It'll also work with HomeChat, LG's automation platform that allows smart products to send notifications to the homebuyer in the form of a text.
The new hub features a color LCD screen that displays notifications, while an internal speaker can stream music from stations or Bluetooth-enabled devices.
Smart ThinQ resembles the tall, cylindrical shape of the Amazon Echo, but unlike the Echo , it cannot be controlled by the voice.
To go along with the Smart ThinQ, LG will be offering smart home packages that builders can market to fit the expectations of specific clients. The “Energy Package” includes smart lighting and energy usage sensors, and the “Safety Package” includes motion sensors and a leak detection system.
Builders can start with a specific package and then fully automate the home with other LG products and third party devices depending on client budget and expectations.
The ThinQ Hub uses popular connection protocols like ZigBee, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, so builders can count on simpler integration among third party devices.
The Smart ThinQ Hub is not the only smart hub on the market with a unique appearance and streaming capabilities. Wink's Relay Hub features a larger color screen, and the Amazon Echo can stream music while communicating with smart home devices.
LG's Smart ThinQ Hub and complete smart lineup will be located in booth 8204 at CES 2016.
Members of Black Lives Matter Toronto protested at a Peel police station in Brampton on Wednesday to show support for the family of Jermaine Carby, a man shot and killed by local police during a traffic stop in September of 2014.
The family was also at 21 Division at the time to serve Peel police with a $12 million civil lawsuit.
Carby's cousin, La Tanya Grant, entered the station along with supporters and took the opportunity to speak to the police directly.
"You're the worst police division in Ontario," Grant said. "You guys are racist. You guys murdered my cousin in the streets like a damn animal."
Carby's mother, Lorna Robinson, was also there, and says that the two years since they lost their son have been "hell" and that it has left a hole in their heart.
"We want justice and we deserve to get compensation after all of what we have been through, and after all of what they did to my son — murdered them cold-blooded — and they didn't do anything," Robinson said.
'Motivated by racial prejudice and stereotypes'
Carby's family alleges in the suit that they were a victim of racial profiling, saying Constable Jason Senechal wanted to pursue an unwarranted criminal investigation against them when Carby was travelling in Brampton as a passenger in a Volkswagen Jetta. It was Senechal's fellow officer, Constable Ryan Reid, who shot and killed Carby.
"Senechal racially profiled Mr. Carby and concluded, without any lawful basis, that they were involved in criminal activity," the lawsuit reads. "Senechal was motivated by racial prejudice and stereotypes."

None of the allegations in the lawsuit has been proved in court.
When the confrontation between police and Carby escalated, an eyewitness recalled that Carby was walking towards the officers with their arms open when they were shot. Amateur video of the incident displayed during a coroner's inquest had police officers telling them to "drop the knife," although at least one witness said they didn't see a knife at the time.
The lawsuit says Carby, who was 33 at the time of their death, was "a person who suffered from [a] serious and debilitating mental illness" and alleges the officer knew they had a mental illness, had previously attempted suicide and wanted police to shoot him, but deliberately ignored the information.
'Uphill battle'
Getting any money from the suit may be difficult, Toronto lawyer Barry Swadron says, calling what the family faces "an uphill battle."
"In this case, you're suing Peel region and all they have to do is to raise your taxes to have enough money to defend the police," Swadron said. "It's a very, very expensive procedure to sue the police. Very, very few people have the resources to fight the police."
The Peel police has come under fire in the past for the controversial practice of carding, and a CBC News survey found that, in relation to the diverse population it serves, it is one of the least reflective in Canada.

Officer wouldn't have done anything differently
The province's Special Investigations Unit cleared Ryan Reid, the officer who shot and killed Carby, and they told the inquest into the shooting earlier this year that they wouldn't have done anything differently.
Prior to Reid's testimony, police said that the confrontation between the officers and Reid escalated when they were asked for their name and ID. When they found warrants for their arrest in British Columbia. Reid explained, that's when Carby pulled out a knife and said "Shoot me, shoot me."
"The last thing I wanted to do was kill Mr. Carby," the officer said. "I wanted to stop the threat."

The director of the SIU told the inquest a knife wasn't found at the scene, but was delivered hours later to the civilian agency investigating the shooting by a police sergeant.
The inquest deemed Carby's death a homicide, and a jury made 14 recommendations, focusing on finding methods of de-escalation and avoiding "unconscious bias" during traffic stops.
"From day one, I knew something was wrong, and I did my own independent investigation alongside the SIU and found a lot of discrepancies," Grant said. "The truth came out at the coroner's inquest, and that's why we decided to pursue this civil lawsuit."
However, a verdict of homicide at an inquest is not the same as in a criminal proceeding. Inquest jurors issue the ruling when they determine someone is responsible for a death, but they are not allowed to say who bears that responsibility.
CBC News contacted Peel police, and was told that because this is a civil case, that they wouldn't comment.
Sound Transit's ridership continues to rise, fueled mostly by light rail expansion, according third quarter ridership numbers released by the agency last week. Ridership across the system was up 6.5% over the same quarter in 2016.
In an accompanying press release, Sound Transit lauded current year-to-date ridership in 2017, up 26% on Link and 12% across the entire system compared to the same time period last year.
“The ridership gains within our region are very significant in contrast to recent ridership reductions in many other regions, with Sound Transit services seeing some of the strongest growth in the nation.”
All transportation modes posted ridership increases, except ST Express bus service which declined 0.6%. ST Express posted the same ridership decline last quarter and once again, ST attributes that decrease to low fuel prices, “which tends to depress bus ridership.”
Light rail ridership continues to climb, showing strong growth of 13.5% during the third quarter compared to the same time period last year. Overall this year Link ridership is up 26%.
ST attributes the increase to two 2016 service expansions, including the opening of Angle Lake Station, with roughly 1,100 parking stalls, at the end of the third quarter last year.
However, Link ridership slightly underperformed for Q3, with the 6,352,260 boardings “slightly outside the quarterly target” of 6,591,656. Ridership did meet the current year to date target.
Boardings at the Tukwila International Boulevard and the SeaTac / Airport Stations continue to decline, 6.3% and 13.2% respectively comparing third quarters of 2016 and 2017. All year boardings at both stations have decreased compared to similar time periods in 2016.
According to the third quarter ridership report, “The decline in average weekday boardings at SeaTac Airport Station is attributed to the station no longer being the southern terminus. Many boardings that were previously seen at TIBS and SeaTac are now occurring further south at Angle Lake.”
Eight of the 16 Link stations in the Seattle area saw a double-digit increase in boardings this quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Rainier Beach saw the largest percentage increase of boardings at 17.9%.
Sounder ridership was up slightly, 2.7% in last quarter compared to last year. However, the weekday average was up 5.7%. All the ridership growth on the Sounder came from South Line, which was up 6.4% in daily boardings, while the North Line posted a decline of 0.2%. ST credits the growth on the South Line to two new mid-day trains added in September 2016.
A slight increase in Tacoma Link ridership of 3.2%, compared to the third quarter of 2016, is attributed to an increase in special event services.

Alex Dunbar and Josh Strauss both return from injury for Glasgow Warriors European Rugby Champions Cup encounter with Montpellier at the Altrad Stadium tomorrow (kick-off 5.15pm UK time) – live on Sky Sports 2.
The other changes to the team which beat Bath 37-10 last weekend see Finn Russell replace Duncan Weir at fly-half and Tim Swinson come in for Leone Nakarawa at second row, to make their 50th appearance for the club.
The last time the two teams met in France was in 2011, when the sides drew 13-13, with Rory Lamont scoring the Warriors try that day.
Glasgow has an unchanged back three, with Stuart Hogg operating at full-back and Tommy Seymour and Sean Maitland on either wing.
Dunbar returns from injury at centre in place of Peter Horne and lines up alongside Mark Bennett, who scored two tries against Bath in the last round.
Russell starts at stand-off and last week's man of the match Henry Pyrgos is at scrum-half.
In the pack, Gordon Reid and Euan Murray make their third consecutive starts, while centurion Pat MacArthur is retained at hooker.
Jonny Gray and Swinson will be in charge of the engine room and Strauss comes in at number 8, replacing Adam Ashe.
The South African, who will combine with Rob Harley and Chris Fusaro in the back-row, will captain the side.
Fraser Brown and Alex Allan are the only changes to the bench from last week, with Dougie Hall and Jerry Yanuyanutawa not included in the squad.
Glasgow Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend said: "Our win against Bath has given us the best possible start to our European campaign and we are very determined to build on that result over in France.
"Montpellier have been in great form this season and they have a squad packed full of international players. We are looking forward to the challenge of playing in France against a quality side.
"It'll be a special day for Tim Swinson, who is set to make their 50th appearance for the club and I'd like to congratulate them on this achievement."

The perpetrators are reported to have entered the building site late Saturday/early Sunday morning. As well as the symbol associated with the Nazis, the vandals also wrote slurs such as "off with you to the concentration camp!"
The attack on the mosque has coincided with the rise of the controversial "anti-Islamization" PEGIDA movement in Germany. The group has been holding demonstrations in cities throughout the country for the past 10 weeks.
Head of Neuss district police, Hans-Jürgen Petrauschke said they were horrified by the racially motivated crime. There is "no place for the spread of xenophobia or the glorification of the Nazi past" in the Rhein-Kreis Neuss area," they told reporters.
State security from Düsseldorf have begun an investigation into the crime and have also announced an reward of 1,500 euros ($1,833) for information leading to the arrest of the vandals.
Right-wing shift
Generally, anti-Islamic sentiment has become far more vocal in Germany in recent weeks. Last Monday, in the eastern German city of Dresden, PEGIDA, which loosely translates as "Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West," held their largest demonstration to date, with over 15,000 people taking to the streets in protest.
Some observers fear that the protests are a sign that xenophobia is becoming increasingly socially acceptable in the country.
Earlier this month, three buildings in the southern German state of Bavaria, which were intended to be used as accommodation for refugees were severely damaged by fire in a suspected arson attack. Racist graffiti was also found on a nearby building, bolstering suspicions that the blazes were deliberately set.

A Virginia woman was outraged after the maid they hired stole $5,000 worth of jewelry from their home and then the jury chipped in to pay for the woman's fine after convicting them of theft.
Sandra Mendez Ortega, 19, who is in the country illegally, was convicted of felony grand larceny for stealing three rings on Dec. 8 by a jury at Fairfax County court. Instead of jail time, the jury sentenced them to a $60 fine.
A sympathetic jury for the teenager, who is pregnant with their second child, and pulled together $80 to pay for the fine after they convicted her/
Jury supervisor Jeffrey Memmott told The Washington Post the jurors felt sympathy for the woman who testified they dropped out of school after sixth grade, had one child and was pregnant with another but was not employed.
“The general sentiment was they were a victim, too,” Memmott said. “Two of the women (jurors) were crying because of how bad they felt. One lady pulled out a $20 bill, and just about everybody chipped in.”
Memmott said they contacted the case's public defender and went to the former maid's home to give them $80, more than enough to pay their $60 fine.

“Justice had to be done,” Janice Woolridge, a juror, told The Washington Post. “But there's also got to be some compassion somewhere. Young people make bad decisions. We just couldn't pile on any more.”
However, Lisa Copeland, Mendez Ortega's employer, was not happy with the sentencing – or their actions. They told the post that a $60 fine was insufficient for the crime committed and claimed Ortega told lie after lie.
“I was outraged,” Copeland said. “I was just flabbergasted. I didn't think $60 equated to the crime at all.”
Copeland said they discovered the rings missing in Sept. 2016 and actually did not realize a third ring had disappeared until they were turned in. The rings were worth at least $5,000, they aid.
Copeland called Fairfax City police who questioned the three housekeepers – including Mendez Ortega – who cleaned Copeland's home and they all denied wrongdoing.
However, following the questioning the 19-year-old reportedly felt guilty about the stealing and told Copeland's husband, Jeff, they had the rings and gave them back, The Washington Post reported. Police also had the young woman write the Copeland's a letter of apology. Copeland said they have never seen the apology and the former maid never said sorry to them in person.
“Never saw it,” Copeland said. “Never heard about it until the trial, during sentencing.”

Mendez Ortega was arrested and spent eight days in jail but posted the $1,000 bond and was released. The jury was not told of the woman's stint in jail and that they were in the country illegally because “it was not relevant to whether they stole the rings.”
Copeland said they felt the jury should have been told these facts.
“I think it's relevant to the case,” Copeland said.
“It really irritates me that they came here and committed a felony,” Jeff Copeland told The Washington Post. “People are coming here because there is opportunity here. But when they come here and commit crimes, that's where you've got to draw the line.”
Lisa Copeland said they were “amazed” the jury did not want to convict Mendez Ortega although they confessed.
“The fact that they confessed,” they said, “and they didn't want to convict her? I don't get this. That's basically saying it's okay to steal.”
Mendez Ortega faced up to 20 years in prison and a $2,500 fine but the jury only made them pay a fine that would be equivalent to a day's pay.
Speaking through an interpreter, they said they were “happy” following their sentencing.
“I became happy when I heard they wanted to give me that (money.) Thank you very much to all of them, God bless them,” they said.

Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi, which recently became the global number three seller of smartphones, and which was co-founded by billionaire Lei Jun in 2010, started selling its phones in India less than four months ago. Unlike in China, the company doesn't have--as yet--its own e-commerce store in India and has partnered with online retailer Flipkart to sell its phones and a handful of accessories in this market. Since it's a new brand in a crowded Indian market, the company sells its phones once a week in a flash sale. Potential customers have to register with Flipkart in the six days prior to the day of the sale and products are sold on a first come, first served basis. If the stock runs out, you have to register all over again for next week's sale.
India head Manu Jain and Xiaomi Global VP Hugo Barra say the company has global aspirations, including big plans for India. In an interview with Forbes the duo share some of their journey in India so far, including opening its first R&D center here. The unit here, a 100% subsidiary, is merely called Mi India. Apparently the full name is too difficult for Indians to pronounce. Edited excerpts.
FORBES: Why India? Especially as there are several local and foreign players already entrenched here?
Manu Jain: When we look at what geographies we want to enter, there are a few criteria that we consider, such as, places where e-commerce is beginning to take off, where there's the potential of a large market and one that's not operator-driven, as it is in the U.S. [where operators like AT&T and Verizon bundle the instruments with their services, making the latest phones very affordable to most]. In India we can sell high quality devices independent of the operators. And we're seeing an exponential growth in the number of smartphones [being sold] in the market as well as there are huge numbers of people coming online. [Per research firm Canalys, 47 million smartphones were sold in the first three quarters of this year, up from 25 million for the same period a year ago.]
FORBES: How much preparation did it take for you to be able to start letting people register for your phones from 15 July?
MJ: It took Hugo and me three months of active preparation. We had to set up our own call centers and service centers. We also had to prepare as India is different from other countries and we had to be ready for those differences. For instance, there are language barriers, there are [federal] laws and state laws. India has cash on delivery, which doesn't exist in any other country to this extent as far as we know, the kind of plugs that are used here are different from the ones in China.
Hugo Barra: We're a classic tech startup. We set up shop in Bangalore because we think that's like the Silicon Valley of India and that's where we can attract the most amount of talent. In my previous job at Google I would frequently visit Bangalore and I've seen the talent. [As part of our preparation to launch] We built up a core R&D team and a core operations team with a network of after sales service centers.
FORBES: Have you sold many phones here so far?
MJ: In May we thought if we could sell about 10,000 units a week, it'll be a reasonable success. We don't do any paid advertising globally or in India [so we didn't know what to expect here.] We now sell 50,000 to 100,000 phones a week. On October 6, which was our first sale day for that month, and which was also Flipkart's Big Billion Day sale, we sold 175,000 devices. In India we see anywhere between 200,000 and 300,000 people registering for our sales each week. On the Big Billion Day sale day we wanted to offer more devices but couldn't because the manufacturer didn't place enough orders for chargers.
FORBES: To tackle those sorts of problems, would you think about manufacturing in India?
MJ: We are seriously considering manufacturing in India, but it also depends upon the ecosystem which is still at a very nascent stage here.
HB: Manufacturing in India is not just about finding a factory. It's about an ecosystem and we need to be able to source locally. For instance, in Brazil, where I'm from, by perforce of regulation you have to manufacture locally because it's too expensive to import. That might play out in India. A higher import duty doesn't really matter to us because everyone gets hit by it. That apart, we want to build an Indian business and an Indian company. Manufacturing is in that spectrum and something we'd like to do. If we can help accelerate developing that ecosystem in India, we would be very, very honored.
FORBES: What next in your plans for India?
MJ: We plan to launch by the end of this month the Redmi 1, which is our affordable phablet and then the Mi 4, which is part of our flagship series. We're also planning to build up our theme store--in fact we're launching a new theme next week which is my personal favorite. Our R&D lab, which we just set up, will be testing our products in Indian conditions, including on the different bandwidths. The next stage for the lab is to customize parts of our products for the Indian customer, like facial recognition and build India specific features like languages, and content like movies, cricket.
FORBES: Any plans to bring the Xiaomi TV to India?
HB: It's not just a screen, it's a smart TV. And a smart TV should be a smart TV and have movies and TV shows and games and apps that you can stream or save to watch later. We're working on getting the content ready and available. We're talking to Indian content aggregators and providers.
FORBES: When do you plan to launch this?
HB: Some time in the second half of next year.
FORBES: You're a Chinese company selling technology products in India. That can be controversial. How do you handle it?
HB: I don't know if it's that controversial in practice. The community [of users] sees us for the products that we offer. There was a report out in July that analyzed the data we provide [and said Xiaomi takes personal data without permission]. We took the opportunity to clarify how we back up data and how our cloud messaging service [which is similar to Apple Inc.'s iMessage] works.
FORBES: There's a new government in Delhi. Do you have a wishlist for them?
MJ: There's still a little ambiguity around e-commerce operations and what foreign companies are allowed to do. We would like those to be clarified. And we need infrastructure development, especially as an e-commerce company, our products have to go to small towns.
For other uses, see Kit Kat (disambiguation) Kit Kat is a chocolate-covered wafer bar confection created by Rowntree's of York, United Kingdom, and is now produced globally by Nestlé, which acquired Rowntree in 1988, and closed it in 2006,[1] with the exception of the United States where it is made under license by H.B. Reese Candy Company, a division of The Hershey Company. The standard bars consist of two or four pieces composed of three layers of wafer, separated and covered by an outer layer of chocolate. Each finger can be snapped from the bar separately. There are many different flavours of Kit Kat, including milk, white, and dark chocolate.

History Edit
Use of the name Kit Kat or Kit Cat for a type of food goes back to the 18th century, when mutton pies known as a Kit-Kat were served at meetings of the political Kit-Cat Club in London owned by pastry chef Christopher Catling.[2][3] The origins of what is now known as the Kit Kat brand go back to 1911, when Rowntree's, a confectionery company based in York in the United Kingdom, trademarked the terms Kit Cat and Kit Kat. The names were not used immediately and Kit Kat first appeared in the 1920s, when Rowntree's launched a brand of boxed chocolates entitled Kit Cat. This continued into the 1930s, when Rowntree's shifted focus and production onto its Black Magic and Dairy Box brands. With the promotion of alternative products the Kit Cat brand decreased and was eventually discontinued.[4] The original four-finger bar was developed after a worker at Rowntree's York Factory put a suggestion in a recommendation box for a snack that "a man could take to work in their pack".[5] The bar launched on 29 August 1935, under the title of Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp (priced at 2d), and was sold in London and throughout southern England.[6] Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp was renamed Kit Kat Chocolate Crisp in 1937, the same year that Kit Kat began to incorporate "Break" into its recognisable advertising strategy.[definition needed][4] The colour scheme and first flavour variation to the brand came in 1942, owing to World War II, when food shortages prompted an alteration in the recipe. The flavour of Kit Kat was changed to dark chocolate; the packaging abandoned its Chocolate Crisp title, and was coloured blue.[7] After the war the name became Kit Kat, with the original milk chocolate recipe and red packaging. 4-finger US Kit Kat Following its success in the United Kingdom, in the 1940s Kit Kat was exported to Canada, South Africa, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. In 1958, Donald Gilles, the executive at JWT Orland, created the iconic advertising line "Have a Break, Have a Kit Kat". The brand further expanded in the 1970s when Rowntree created a new distribution factory in Germany to meet European demand, and established agreements to distribute the brand in the US through the Hershey company, and in Japan through Fujiya.[4] In June 1988, Swiss company Nestlé acquired Kit Kat through the purchase of Rowntree's, giving Nestlé global control over the brand, except in the US,[8] and production and distribution increased with new facilities in Japan and additional manufacturing operations set up in Malaysia, India and China.[4] The Hershey Company has a licence to produce Kit Kat bars in the United States which dates from 1970, when Hershey executed a licensing agreement with Rowntree which allowed Hershey to retain the Kit Kat licence so long as Hershey was not sold. Nestlé, which has a substantial presence in the US, had to honour the licensing agreement when it bought Rowntree in 1988. As Kit Kat is one of Hershey's top five brands in the US market, the Kit Kat licence was a key factor in Hershey's failed attempt to attract a serious buyer in 2002.[9][10] Variants in the traditional chocolate bar first appeared in 1996 when Kit Kat Orange, the first flavour variant, was introduced in the United Kingdom. Its success was followed by several varieties including mint and caramel, and in 1999 Kit Kat Chunky was launched and received favourably by international consumers. Variations on the traditional Kit Kat have continued to be developed since then. In 2000 Nestlé acquired Fujiya's share of the brand in Japan, and also expanded its marketplace in Japan, Russia, Turkey, and Venezuela, in addition to markets in Eastern and Central Europe.[4] Throughout the decade Kit Kat introduced dozens of flavours and line extensions within specific consumer markets. It celebrated its 75th anniversary on 10 October 2009.[citation needed] The traditional bar has four fingers which each measure approximately 1 centimetre (0.4 in) by 9 centimetres (3.5 in). A two-finger bar was launched in the 1930s, and has remained the company's best-selling biscuit brand ever since.[6] The 1999 Kit Kat Chunky (known as Big Kat and Kit Kat Extra Crispy in the US) has one large finger approximately 2.5 centimetres (1 in) wide. Kit Kat bars contain varying numbers of fingers depending on the market, ranging from the half-finger sized Kit Kat Petit in Japan, to the three-fingered variants in Arabia, and the twelve-finger family-size bars in Australia and France. Kit Kat bars are sold individually and in bags, boxes and multi-packs. In Ireland, France, the UK and America Nestlé also produces a Kit Kat ice cream, and in Australia and Malaysia, Kit Kat Drumsticks.[citation needed] In 2010, a new £5 million manufacturing line was opened by Nestlé in York, to produce more than a billion Kit Kat bars each year.[11]
Global confection Edit
Countries where Kit Kat is marketed. Kit Kat bars are produced in 16 countries by Nestlé: Brazil, Mexico, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Germany, Russia, Japan, China, Malaysia, Thailand, India, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Bulgaria and Algeria. Kit Kat bars in the United States are produced under licence by The Hershey Company, a Nestlé competitor, due to a prior licensing agreement with Rowntree. The year 2003 was a turning point for the Kit Kat bar as well as the confectionery industry in general. The popularity of low carb diets, and the push to healthier eating stifled sales growth in many parts of the world. In addition, fierce competition from Cadbury's newly formed Dairy Milk superbrand also contributed to Kit Kat sales decreasing considerably in its home market of the UK, and threatened to depose it from its No.1 position.[12][13] The solution adopted by Nestlé and others was to increase dramatically the number of new and unique variations of their confections and market them as limited or special editions, usually only available for a few months at a time so as not lose sales of their standard products.[14] The strategy initially reversed the decline of the Kit Kat[15] and has been adopted worldwide by Nestlé, Hershey, Mars, and others with similar success.[16][17] This has resulted in many new flavours and varieties of the Kit Kat and other confections appearing globally since then. While some flavours succeeded, many failed, alienating some consumers in the process, causing Nestlé to scale back on new releases.[citation needed] In September 2006, Nestlé announced that they would be cutting 645 jobs in their York factory and moving all Smarties production to their Hamburg factory, which had already been producing two-thirds. They stated that this move would allow for a £20 million investment to modernise the antiquated York factory and improve Kit Kat production.[18] As dark chocolate has seen increased demand and favour worldwide because of its purported health benefits, in September 2006 the four-finger Kit Kat Fine Dark was launched in the United Kingdom as a permanent product, and packaging for the entire brand was changed.[citation needed] Hershey had sold the four-finger Kit Kat Dark in the US several years previously as a limited edition, and began doing so again.[19] Nestlé now manufactures two-finger Kit Kats with natural flavourings, and for the first time, Kit Kats in this format are suitable for vegans.[citation needed] It is not known at this date whether or not other varieties will follow suit. In 2014, Kit Kat was ranked the third best selling chocolate bar in the United Kingdom, after Dairy Milk and Galaxy.[20]
Design Edit
The US packaging When first introduced, the original Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp bar had a red wrapper, which briefly became blue between 1945–1947. As a result of milk shortages after the end of World War II, dark chocolate was used instead of milk chocolate during that period.[citation needed] Since its introduction in the 1970s, the Hershey's Kit Kat packaging and advertising in the United States differed from the branding used in every other country where it was sold. In 2002, Hershey Kit Kats adopted the slanted ellipse logo used worldwide by Nestlé, though the ellipse was red and the text white. The US version of "Kit Kat Chunky" is known as "Big Kat". In the United Kingdom, the product was traditionally wrapped in silver foil and an outer paper band. In 2001 this was changed to flow wrap plastic.[21] Foil and paper wrapping is still used for Kit-Kats sold as part of a multipack.
Marketing and promotion Edit
Varieties Edit
Flavours Edit Kit Kat Matcha Many varieties of Kit Kat have existed, either permanently or as limited editions, such as those sold to commemorate festivals such as St. Valentine's Day.[citation needed] In Japan, Nestlé has introduced over 200 different flavours since 2000,[31] including ginger ale, soy sauce, creme brulee, green tea, sake, and banana.[32] The flavours are designed to appeal to younger buyers,[33] and are often bought as good-luck gifts as the brand name echoes the Japanese phrase "Kitto Katsu", roughly translating as "surely win."[31] The Kit Kat Orange was the first flavour variant to be introduced in the United Kingdom, in 1996 and 1998 in Ireland. It was followed in 1997 by the Kit Kat Dark and Kit Kat Mint.[citation needed] All three were available as permanent editions of the two-finger multipack in the United Kingdom, along with the Kit Kat Original, the Kit Kat White, and from 2012 the Kit Kat Cookies & Cream. A wide variety of promotional items exist, ranging from traditional merchandise (such as mugs, pens, oven gloves and tea-towels) to less common items such as coats for small dogs. Recently in Japan,[when?] Kit Kats have come packaged with CD singles, and a special limited edition double pack of Kit Kat Crispy Monogatari came bundled with a mini book featuring six short stories, one of which was written by Koji Suzuki, author of the Ring cycle series. In Japan, Kit Kats are also available in jars that are dispensed from vending machines. Forms Edit Kit Kat varieties: Pop Choc, regular and Chunky (or Big Kat) The 'standard' Kit Kat finger bars can come in a variety of presentations and nutritional values. The bars can come in a miniature form of two finger mini bars, or a larger standard four, or in some cases, three, fingered bars. The standard size has been upgraded in several cases up to a 'monster Size' bar, which can include up to five or eight fingers. Large single-fingered "Chunky Kit Kats" were launched in the United Kingdom in 1998 and have been sold in a variety of flavours. The market for Chunky Kit Kats has also expanded to Canada. Other forms and shapes include "Choc'n'Go" individually wrapped fingers in France, a twelve-finger "Family Block" available in New Zealand[34] and Australia, round bite-sized "Pop Choc" pieces, square "Kubes", praline-filled "Senses", a yoghurt with Kit Kat pieces, and a Kit Kat ice cream cone. In the 1980s, a Kit Kat with five shorter fingers was sold in vending machines in the UK.[35] The Japanese Bake 'N Tasty Mini Kit Kats Custard Pudding Flavour was launched in 2014. The bar must be baked in an oven before consumption, and the surface sugar caramelises in the process.[36] In 2015, a new luxury and giftable variant of Kit Kat called Kit Kat Rubies was launched in Malaysia. Comes with the box of 20 small bars, the Kit Kat Rubies bar made with the premium chocolate truffle cream and imported roasted hazelnut pieces.[37] As of 2017, U.S. variants include the standard and king-size four-finger bars, standard bars covered with white or dark chocolate, snack-size orange-covered bars for Halloween, bagged wrapped one-finger miniatures (original and assorted), unwrapped minis, a redesigned Big Kat, and a king-size Big Kat (two of the new Big Kat bars).[38]
Chocolatory Melbourne Edit
Kit Kat has opened a Chocolatory in the Melbourne Central Shopping Centre in Melbourne, Australia. The shop allows customers to use touch screens to create their own Kit Kat from a selection of chocolates and ingredients; they are made while the customers wait.[39]
Criticism and controversy Edit
In March 2010, Kit Kat was targeted for a boycott by Greenpeace for using palm oil, which the environmental organisation claimed resulted in destruction of forest habitats for orangutans in Indonesia.[40] A YouTube video by Greenpeace went viral[41] and Nestlé announced a partnership with The Forest Trust to establish "responsible sourcing guidelines" and ensure that its products did not have a deforestation footprint. They aimed to achieve a fully sustainable method of palm oil harvesting by 2015.[42] Nestlé state that 58% of palm oil purchased in 2017 was responsibly sourced.[43] Kit Kat Milk Chocolate is made for the North American market with the ingredient PGPR (polyglycerol polyricinoleate, E476, AKA Palsgaard PGPR 4150),[44] which is used to reduce the amount of cocoa butter needed and as an emulsifier.[45] The FDA has determined it to be safe for humans in amounts up to 7.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. "Liver and kidney enlargement was noticed at much higher doses."[46]

WASHINGTON — First, anti-Trump Republicans thought they could beat Donald Trump outright in the primary.
Then they thought they could hold them under the required threshold number of delegates and beat them in a floor fight at the convention.
After that went out the window, some of the most ardent Trump opponents floated the idea of a third-party conservative option. But the only person who seemed like they really might do it, National Review writer David French, bowed out before it could become a reality. It seemed as though the never-Trump crowd was finally out of options.
However, this week, there has been renewed talk of stopping Trump at the convention — but it's a very, very tall order.
"Everyone is looking at options available right now," said one anti-Trump Republican strategist. "The momentum seems to be on the side of fixing this in Cleveland. The last three days has been active, based on the past three weeks of what it's like for them to be presumptive nominee."
One of the principal ideas being discussed would be to find a way to make delegates free to vote for whomever they choose. The RNC's Rules Committee, which has 112 members, meets before the convention starts, and it could in theory hold a vote to unbind the delegates.
"The RNC Rules Committee should amend the rules to allow each delegate to make an objection of conscience to Trump on the first ballot," Tim Miller, former Jeb Bush spokesperson and adviser to the anti-Trump Our Principles PAC, tweeted on Tuesday.
"I definitely think the conversation is resurfacing," Miller said in an email. "The change needed would be, while obviously extremely significant, simple to accomplish. The Rules Committee would need to only add a single line giving the delegates some kind of freedom."
Even conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt, who remained neutral throughout the primary, blasted Trump on their radio show on Wednesday and called for the party to find a way to stop their nomination in Cleveland.
Trump's disastrous past week, in which their racist comments about the judge in the Trump University case have intensified the Republican civil war over their nomination, seems to have re-energized the discussion of whether there is a way to stop them from becoming the nominee, including possible rules changes at the convention.
Some are arguing this wouldn't even require a rules change. Former Iowa Republican Party chairperson A.J. Spiker forwarded BuzzFeed News a link to Unbound, a book by North Dakota Rules Committee member Curly Haugland that posits that delegates are not in fact bound on the first ballot.
"There's a long history in the Republican Party of delegates voting their conscience," Spiker said. "There is a path for the party to go in a different direction than Trump. The delegates are the ultimate authority of the Republican Party." Spiker tweeted on Tuesday that "the Republican Party needs a patriot to step forward, challenge Trump, work delegates and win the GOP nomination for president in Cleveland." On Wednesday, they told BuzzFeed News they thought the most viable scenario would be a former candidate who has suspended their campaign un-suspending. Technically, candidates can un-suspend their campaigns after suspending them and re-enter the race. The former candidate who has the most delegates after Trump is Ted Cruz.
"I would say if you have a candidate or two candidates who step forward, Donald Trump will not be the nominee," Spiker said.
(Spiker also proposed another route, which is delegates abstaining.)
In a post on Medium on Wednesday, Never Trump PAC strategist Rory Cooper wrote that there needs to be a "mechanism" by which delegates can vote for an alternative.
"The Rules Committee have it within their power to install a mechanism whereas if a potential nominee crosses a line or embarrasses the party to an extraordinary degree, delegates can vote for an alternative candidate," Cooper wrote. "Many in the party believe Trump has already crossed that Rubicon."
It isn't clear yet whether there could be real momentum behind this idea or whether it will turn out, like the David French moment, to be dead on arrival.
"The method to do it is very clear, it's just changing some rules at the Rules Committee," said Doug Heye, a former spokesperson for Eric Cantor and longtime Republican operative who opposes Trump. "But that doesn't mean that it's an easy thing to do mechanically or for what they party would have to go through."
And making an eleventh-hour move to take the nomination away from Trump could throw what will already be a tense convention into chaos, and permanently alienate Trump's supporters, Heye argued.
Trump "won fair and square, and that can't be denied," Heye said. "Can the nomination that he's earned be denied him, and what would the repercussions be for doing so?"
Teachers' unions are often portrayed by their opponents as standing in the way of efforts to reform our schools. Maybe this isn't such a bad thing.
In Wisconsin in February of 2011, tens of thousands of protesters descended on the capital, Madison, to protest an extreme union-busting bill aimed at reducing the power of that state's teacher unions. Ultimately those protests failed, but they were a remarkable display of worker solidarity and middle class organizing. Largely, this was because they involved teachers who remain one of the best organized workforces in the country.
More recently, in Tacoma, Washington teachers went on strike in order to secure slightly smaller class sizes and rebuke a pay cut aimed at closing a shortfall in the district budget. The strike ended recently, with both sides getting some of what they wanted.
I've wrestled a great deal with the question of organized labor, especially in the realm of public education. There's a strong contingent on the right and the left that believes that essentially all of the flaws in our public school system stem from a combination of government inefficiency and union recalcitrance. Some people in the reform movement believe that the only way to affect reform is to sidestep or abolish teachers unions.
Many left-leaning school reformers believe this largely as a last resort. These are typically liberals who believe in public education but have become frustrated with what they see as union resistance to much-needed reforms. There is no doubt that unions oppose many reforms. The question is, should they? Much of the time, I think they should.
Many right-leaning reformers, and some liberals as well, are simply in the business of union-busting, seeking to dismantle a powerful political opponent while ushering for-profit schools in through the side door, and handing out lucrative contracts to political allies in the private sector. For a good example of this second camp, go to Scott Walker's Wisconsin. Or follow Michelle Rhee around the country - to Florida, Nevada, or wherever they are voicing their support for union-busting at the moment.
Right or left, this is essentially the neoliberal approach to school reform. Technocratic, choice-based, with a troubling dose of private, for-profit groups thrown into to the mix. Mayor Bloomberg's New York schools are a perfect example of technocratic, anti-democratic leadership at the top, coupled with private contractors, high-stakes testing companies, and union-busting advocacy groups working from the ground up.
The Unreliable Promise of School Reform
Of course, the word "reform" when juxtaposed with "education" is not in and of itself a bad thing. I believe that some ideas in the school reform movement have potential. There is a real chance that experimenting with how schooling is delivered could have some real benefits.
If we can find ways to deliver education to the most underserved communities in this country, that alone would be a huge step forward. And as I've mentioned before, I don't find every argument on the "anti-reform" side all that compelling either. Nobody is on the side of angels all the time.
Then again, a good charter school is more like a band-aid than it is a structural fix. Worse, some charters could serve as Trojan horses, chartered with the best of intentions, but then funded by donors with an anti-union agenda, and paraded in the media as reformer avatars.
A lot of money goes into these schools – quite a lot more than was being funneled from private coffers into the traditional public schools. This says nothing about the people running these schools who are more than likely doing it for the right reasons, but why have these very deep pockets suddenly opened up not to traditional public schools but to the charter school movement? Surely there's a reason.
Nor do all school choice efforts live up to their promises. Vouchers have been met not only with public disappointment, but with few if any real benefits. Most charters haven't fared much better. And for-profit schools come packaged with all sorts of other troubling implications for the future of our public – or should I say “public” – education system. Do we want to transform our elementary and high schools into little dopplegangers of College of America or the University of Phoenix?
Other ideas are equally repellent, such as high-stakes testing which seeks, in spite of claims to the contrary, to boil down education to learning by rote. When technocrats and business people take over the hard work of designing a system of education is it surprising that the result is a complex labyrinth of testing testing schemes aimed at only those subjects that can be measured, quantified, and pasted into spreadsheets? Is it any wonder that professionals who care about education might see this as a threat?
Teacher Buy-In is Necessary for Sustainable Reform
If I could wave a magic wand I would graft Finland's model of public education onto our own. And yes, I realize that even drawing close to Finland's educational successes will take far more than any magic wand could provide.
One problem we face is that our reform movement has become defined by a very specific, narrow set of ideas: choice and testing and tinkering with teacher compensation and benefits. Very little attention has been paid to curriculum, infrastructure, or equitable school funding.
Most importantly, the very, very hard work of education reform will require teachers if we want it to succeed, whereas the current crop of reformers is intent on bypassing the teachers and especially the teachers' unions. There are not many advocates for our public education system or for the welfare of children who have the organizational structure and commitment that America's teachers have.
Parents are the only comparable demographic but they are fragmented and are often only temporary activists. No other group comes close.
Big charities, foundations, and other reform groups can leave the field at any time. They have no vested interest save their own interest, for better or worse.
The National Education Association, or NEA, was founded as a professional association of educators in 1857 and evolved into the largest teachers union in the country. The American Federation of Teachers, or AFT, was founded decades later in 1916 and is affiliated with the AFL-CIO. Both organizations have worked to improve school conditions both for teachers and students for decades. This is important to think about. They are not newcomers to the field. They've had their hands deep in the dirt for much of the history of public education.
Yes, we hear stories of unions and union members behaving badly, and these stories will be forever regurgitated to prove that the institutions themselves are to blame. What institution is exempt from this critique? What group of people does not have such members?
A sustained effort to improve and reform our schools will not only require the commitment of the labor force in the here and now, it will require the long-term commitment of teachers both in the field now and those who will come later. Some portions of our education system may need to be reformed, this is very true. Reform should never stop. Progress doesn't magically happen whilst we twiddle our collective thumbs. But without teacher buy-in no reforms will stick.
Furthermore, without the participation of teachers in the reform process, we risk sacrificing . An even lower-paid teaching force, with fewer benefits and less job security, is what the neoliberal approach to education reform actually offers. It's not what's promised: reformers often honestly want to make a grand bargain between job security and teacher pay, offering more of the latter for less of the former. But we know how these things work. Once they take away job security and collective bargaining rights, what's to stop them from taking away pay, benefits, and everything else?
Democracy in Education
The teachers unions are not always right. No group is. But they represent a democratic approach to our public education system, and if we push them out and usher in an age of for-profit online schools, cheaper labor, and funnel all those saved tax dollars back in the pockets of the wealthiest Americans, we may as well kiss our public schools goodbye.
I support teachers unions not because they are a model of efficiency or because they are always right or because I think there is no need for reform – I believe that the unions can be inefficient, they can be wrongheaded, they can oppose change unnecessarily.
No, I support teachers unions because they are the best chance this country has to improve and strengthen public education for the long haul. No other organization will step in to protect teachers from political blowback and the reform-trend-of-the-moment. The Gates Foundation may have its heart in the right place, but the big foundations can't protect teachers from slashed budgets or political retribution. Charity-propelled education reform may very well be a sincere effort, but in the process its leaders have offered up a lot of bad choices for teachers. Too often charity reform translates into little more than corporate reform.
Teachers are on the front lines of the fight to keep America's egalitarian system of public education public. Faux privatization schemes and for-profit schools threaten to undermine the system itself in the name of choice. But what about democracy? What about a system built around the ethic of society rather than that of the individual?
Certainly our public school system could be better. Nobody is suggesting otherwise. Maybe there are radical ideas out there that really would work if given the chance, and I do support experimentation which was the original purpose of charter schools. Let's keep trying things. Let's keep experimenting, innovating, and learning from our mistakes. But let's not do this on the backs of our teaching workforce without bothering to include them in the process.
Teachers are one of the last bastions of workplace democracy left in the country, and once they're out of the picture anything goes. Including public education.
Even if you believe that public education itself is wrong and would prefer a voluntary education system, or a system of teacher/parent cooperatives, or an entirely private or voucher-based system, you still need teachers. In any of these systems teachers should still have the right to form a union, to bargain and negotiate for wages and working conditions, and to find voice and agency in the loud cacophony of common cause.

(Reuters Health) - Antidepressant use right before and during pregnancy may be linked with a higher risk of an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children, hints a new analysis of past research.
But pregnant women on antidepressant medications should not stop taking them, because the data that tie their use in pregnancy to ASDs are weak, said the study's senior author. Additionally, there could be consequences to not treating depression during pregnancy.
“Each prescription should be evaluated individually,” said Dr. Florence Gressier, of the Bicetre University Hospital in Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.
Gressier and colleagues write in JAMA Pediatrics that up to 15 percent of women have depression during pregnancy. Women with untreated depression are at an increased risk of complications and poor follow up for a number of chronic health conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure.
The use of antidepressants during pregnancy is increasing around the world, write the researchers. The most popular ones, known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are linked to a number of risks and some benefits during pregnancy.
The researchers add that other research suggests children exposed to antidepressants in the womb are at an increased risk for ASDs, which the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health says are a group of developmental disorders that may affect communication, social and other skills.
For the new analysis, the researchers combed academic databases for studies that examined the link between antidepressant exposure in the womb and the risk of ASDs. They found 10 studies with mixed results.
When the researchers looked at six studies with 117,737 participants that compared people with autism to people without, they found that children were 81 percent more likely to be diagnosed with an ASD if they were exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy.
Some of that excess risk, however, could be explained by the mothers' past history of mental illness.
The researchers found similar results when they looked at antidepressant exposure during specific trimesters.
There was no link between antidepressant use during pregnancy and ASDs when the researchers looked at two studies that followed 772,331 children over time.
Data from four studies did show 77 percent higher odds of ASDs among children born to women who used antidepressants before pregnancy, however.
“I think this is one of these situations where this gets a lot of attention in the media, but the results are actually pretty challenging to interpret,” said Dr. Jeremy Veenstra-VanderWeele, of the Columbia University Department of Psychiatry in New York. “In some ways, the strongest association with preconception exposure and increased risk of ASDs suggests to me at least there is something hidden here.”
Veenstra-VanderWeele, who was not involved with the new analysis, told Reuters Health it's difficult to account for several factors that may also explain the increased risk of ASDs. For example, the researchers can't control for the severity of the mother's mental illness and how resistant it is to treatment.
“From my perspective, the data on antidepressant use during pregnancy in relation to autism risk would not prevent me from prescribing these medicines,” they said.
More detailed data are required, Gressier told Reuters Health. For example, researchers should collect data on - among other things - the mothers' depression during pregnancy, depression severity, if the mothers are taking their medications, the dose of the medication and use of other substances.

Shell Discovers 500 Billion Cubic Feet of Natural Gas in Egypt's Western Desert
New natural gas discoveries were made earlier this month in Egypt's western desert, announced Royal Dutch Shell plc, commonly known as Shell.
The discoveries were made in Alam El-Shawish concession area. Initial estimates indicate that 500 billion cubic feet of natural gas was discovered, with more possible reserves yet to be uncovered, announced the CEO of Shell in Egypt, Eden Murphy, in a statement.
The discovery could produce between 10 and 15 percent of the total production of Badr el-Din Petroleum, which is a joint venture that acts on behalf of Shell and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation.
Murphy added that Shell had used various new technologies to dig one of the deepest wells in the western desert region.
Shell gained the rights to explore the western desert for oil and gas in 2012, signing an agreement with Egypt's Ministry of Petroleum and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation.
The discovery is one of the largest in Egypt's western desert in recent years.
In the past year, Egypt has also made a number of natural gas discoveries, including one ‘super giant' natural gas field.

Debugging CSS Grid Layouts With Firefox Grid Inspector
Smashing Newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our editors' picks twice a month. Your email Subscribe →
This article covers known and obscure features of Firefox DevTools that can come in handy when you're building and debugging shiny new CSS Grid layouts.
You may have heard quite a bit of talk about a CSS feature called “Grid” this year. If you are someone who cringes when you hear the words “CSS” and “grid” in the same sentence, then I highly suggest you check out this new CSS module called CSS Grid.
Browsers render HTML elements as boxes according to the CSS box model, and CSS Grid is a new layout model that provides authors the ability to control the size and position of these boxes and their contents. The module introduces a series of properties that allow us to create grid structures and control the placement and sizing of grid items using CSS.
As Rachel Andrew has said many times before, “Grid works from the container in“ while “Other layout methods start with the item.” This way of thinking about Grid really stuck with me because I'm used to designing directly in the browser. Before the advent of CSS Grid, it was expected that every HTML element was to be rendered one after another, and that was the mental model I'd settled upon.
After playing around with Grid for a bit, I realized my approach to designing layouts had changed. I found myself sketching on paper, thinking about the layout design in its entirety. By the time my fingers were doing their dance across the keyboard, I already knew exactly how my layout would look like.
One of the things I had to wrap my head around was the fact that the grid we define on the grid container is not visible. You can apply borders to your grid items, but you cannot apply a border to your grid lines to see them. This is when a DevTools function like Grid Inspector comes in really handy.
Meet Smashing Book 6 — our brand-new book focused on real challenges and real front-end solutions in the real world: from design systems and accessible single-page apps to CSS Custom Properties, CSS Grid, Service Workers, performance, AR/VR and responsive art direction.

Brief History Of Grid Inspector
I had first heard of a Grid Inspector tool when Jen Simmons tweeted about it back in September 2016, but the team at Mozilla had already been discussing the development of a Grid Inspector tool since July 2015. Matt Claypotch and Jen Simmons had worked on a Firefox add-on called the CSS Grid Inspector, which was released in April 2016. It gave the team some working code build upon, as well as a means of gathering feedback from a larger base of developers.
Although other browsers like Chrome and Internet Explorer each had their respective Grid implementations at the time, with Chrome's behind a flag, and Internet Explorer using the original specification, Firefox was the only browser that was working on a Grid DevTool along with the Grid implementation itself.
The in-depth discussions by the team at Mozilla regarding the Grid Inspector tool covered features like having different colors for different grids on the same page, detection of grid gaps, display of line numbers, and so on. This is a significant reason why the Grid Inspector tool in Firefox has so many advanced features in the latest Nightly (58.0a1, at time of writing), and was one of the features the team had been thinking about and worked on for more than a year.
They have collectively been implemented into a stand-alone Layout panel, which also includes a rendering of the Box Model of a selected HTML element plus the CSS properties related to Box Model. This article will cover these useful features and how they can help when troubleshooting grids.
Overview Of The Layout Panel
Firefox DevTools layout panel (Large preview)
Overlay Grid
The first section you will see in the layout panel is Overlay Grid, which will show you all the elements on the page with display: grid applied. You will be able to turn on the grid overlay on each grid by checking their respective checkbox. For now, only one grid overlay can be displayed at any one time, but having multiple grid overlays is a feature on the roadmap.
Toggle grid overlay (Large preview)
Every additional grid will have a different color from the default purple, but you are free to change the colors of your grid overlays by clicking on the colored circle on the right of each grid element. The grid overlay will show all the grid tracks and grid gaps of the selected grid.
Customize grid overlay color (Large preview)
Once you select a grid, a rendering of the selected grid will appear in the space below in the color of the grid overlay. This rendering will show you each section of the grid you defined and hovering over any section will highlight its corresponding area on the actual page. There will also be a tool-tip that shows you the line number of the row and column of the highlighted grid item.
Visual highlighting tool (Large preview)
Most of us would be in the Rules panel when examining the CSS on our site, and you can toggle the grid overlay from there as well. Select the element which has display: grid applied to it, and click on the waffle-like icon on the property. The options for display of line numbers or grid area names that have been set on the Layout Panel will be respected when the grid overlay is toggled in this manner.
Toggle Grid overlay via Rules panel (Large preview)
Grid Display Settings
The next section on the panel is the Grid Display Settings, which allows us to toggle three options for now. The display of line numbers, the display of area names and the option to extend grid lines indefinitely.
The basic premise of how Grid works is that you first define a grid, then proceed to place your grid items within that grid. You can either place those grid items manually or let the browser do it for you. The position of the grid items depends on their grid-row and grid-column values. Grid lines are referred to by their numerical index which starts from 1.
Toggle line numbers (Large preview)
Once Display line numbers is active, the selected grid overlay will display the line numbers of the grid in the color of each respective grid overlay. Each grid has their own numerical grid index which starts from 1, different grids will not share the same numerical grid index.
Line numbers cut off at the top edge (Large preview)
Line numbers cut off at the side edge (Large preview)
If your grid extends the width or height of the viewport, you will notice that the line numbers get cut off at the edges. The Mozilla team is aware of this issue and it is being tracked under Bug 1396666.
You can also define a grid using the grid-template-areas property, which gives us the ability to name the areas on our grids. The syntax for this property also provides a visualization of the grid structure in the CSS itself, making it easier to understand the layout of the grid from your code.
Take the following block of CSS for example:
.subgrid1 { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; grid-auto-rows: 5em; grid-template-areas: "apple banana pear" "grape watermelon pineapple" "strawberry peach kiwi" }
This creates a 3 by 3 grid and each section is named according to how they are laid out in the grid-template-areas property. If the sections are named, they will be displayed as a second tool-tip when you hover over the rendering of the grid in the layout panel.
Grid area name tool-tip (Large preview)
We can also toggle the display of the grid area names on the grid overlay by checking that option in Grid Display Settings. According to Mozilla, this feature was inspired by CSS Grid Template Builder, which was created by Anthony Dugois.
Toggle grid area names (Large preview)
Fun fact. You can use emojis for grid area names and everything will work just fine.
Emoji grid names (Large preview)
The last option you can toggle is to extend grid lines indefinitely. By default, the grid lines on each grid are constrained to within the bounds of the grid container. But sometimes it can be useful to see how the grid aligns in the context of the entire page.
Extend grid lines indefinitely (Large preview)
A Better Box Model Tool
The Box Model section under the Layout Panel shows a rendering of the dimensions of the selected element, its padding, borders, and margins. In addition to that, it also shows the CSS properties that affect the position, size and geometry of the selected element, namely box-sizing , display , float , line-height , position , and z-index . A convenience when it comes to troubleshooting layout-related CSS issues.
The computed value of the height and width of the selected element and its current positioning value is displayed below the box model outline. You can also directly manipulate the margins, borders, and paddings of the element from the diagram itself.
Tweak layout properties (Large preview)
If you use CSS lengths other than pixels, the DevTools will convert the values into pixels automatically based on the computed value, which is really nifty.
Grid Inspector Plays Well With Transforms
There are many instances where Grid will be used in combination with other CSS layout properties, like transforms, for example. The Grid Inspector tool plays well with CSS transforms and the grid overlay will adjust to it, however, the selected element has been transformed. You will be able to see how the Grid has been rotated, skewed, scaled or translated.

Help Make The Grid Inspector Tool Better
As with any other browser feature, the Grid Inspector tool will inevitably have bugs as the team is hard at work adding new features and polishing existing ones. If you do encounter any such issues, please raise an issue at Bugzilla, Mozilla's bug tracking tool.
The metabug, which tracks all Grid Inspector related issues, is Bug 1181227. You can search for the term Grid Inspector to see the list of related bugs as well.

LAKE OSWEGO — A suburban Portland pastor who won an AR-15 rifle in a raffle and then said they gave it to a gun-owning friend for safekeeping will not be prosecuted for transferring the weapon without conducting a background check, authorities said.
Officials were investigating whether Rev. Jeremy Lucas may have violated a recent state law that makes transferring a gun without a background check illegal, even if the arrangement is between private parties and no money changes hands.
But investigators uncovered no evidence that Lucas, 45, actually transferred the gun and never determined the name of the gun-owning friend, Clackamas County District Attorney John Foote said in a letter to the Oregon State Police.
The letter was written Sept. 9 and made public Thursday by state police.
Lucas didn't speak with investigators, state police said in a statement.
“Without the transferee in this case, I don't think we could ever have a prosecutable case,” Foote wrote.
Lucas, a pastor at Christ Church Episcopal Parish in the affluent suburb of Lake Oswego about 10 miles south of Portland, said in interviews this summer that they spent about $3,000 in discretionary church funds to buy as many rifle raffle tickets as they could for a softball league fundraiser.
When they won, they passed a background check to take possession of the weapon.
They told The Washington Post in July that after they won the rifle, they gave it to a friend for temporary safe-keeping.
But a state law passed last year makes transferring a gun without a background check illegal, even if the arrangement is between private parties and no money changes hands.
The Oregon Firearms Federation, which lobbied against passage of the law, pointed out Lucas' potential law violation to the Oregon State Police, the Lake Oswego Police Department and 30 state lawmakers.
Kevin Starrett, the group's executive director, said Friday they were not surprised that authorities did not charge Lucas.
“Of course they would not prosecute, because it would illuminate the lunacy of this law,” they said. “It's theater. It's farce.”
Comments Lucas made to the newspaper about the transfer of the gun were “insufficient to prove that it happened,” Foote wrote.

BOSTON — Senator Scott Brown reveals in their memoir that they were molested by a camp counselor as a child, according to a “60 Minutes” interview to be broadcast Sunday.
Mr. Brown, a Republican who last year won the Massachusetts seat that former Senator Edward M. Kennedy had held for nearly a half century, is to embark on a national tour next week to promote the book, “Against All Odds: My Life of Hardship, Fast Breaks, and Second Chances,” which is scheduled to be released Monday.
Its publication comes as Mr. Brown gears up for a re-election campaign in 2012. They have said that they hope to raise up to $25 million for the campaign.
A former state senator, Mr. Brown instantly became a Republican celebrity after winning the Senate seat by a decisive margin in this heavily Democratic state. Their victory ended the Democrats' supermajority in the Senate and energized Republicans heading into last fall's midterms.
Democrats are still looking for a strong challenger for next year's race after Gov. Deval Patrick and Victoria Reggie Kennedy, Mr. Kennedy's widow, ruled out running.
In the “60 Minutes” interview, Mr. Brown says they never told anyone about the abuse — which they say happened “more than once” at a summer camp — before writing the book.
“Fortunately nothing was ever fully consummated, so to speak,” they say in the interview, “but it was certainly, back then, very traumatic. They said, ‘If you tell anybody I'll kill you.'”
Mr. Brown also writes in the book about shoplifting numerous items as a teenager, including a three-piece suit, according to The Boston Globe, which obtained a copy on Wednesday. They have previously acknowledged being arrested for shoplifting records when they were 12.
Their book tour will start in Boston on Tuesday and go to Texas, California and Florida before returning to New England.
The goal of the network is a long-term expansion of the playing field for conservatives. | AP Photos Koch brothers plan $125M spree
The Koch brothers' main political arm intends to spend more than $125 million this year on an aggressive ground, air and data operation benefiting conservatives, according to a memo distributed to major donors and sources familiar with the group.
The projected budget for Americans for Prosperity would be unprecedented for a private political group in a midterm, and would likely rival even the spending of the Republican and Democratic parties' congressional campaign arms.
Story Continued Below
The group already has spent more than $35 million on ads attacking vulnerable Democrats in key Senate and House races, according to sources, including Sens. Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas. The $125 million projection comes from a memo obtained by POLITICO, labeled as a “Confidential Investor Update” provided to major donors in March, but a source familiar with AFP called the figure a “very conservative estimate. We're on track for more than that.”
( QUIZ: How well do you know the Koch brothers?)
An AFP spokesperson declined to comment on its 2014 budget, but did not dispute the authenticity of the memo. It details the group's efforts to beef up its field operation in key counties, and to deploy a new “closed-loop data system in which volunteer and membership information is automatically updated” for access by phone bankers and canvassers roaming neighborhoods with tablets.
The plans — combined with those of other groups in the sprawling political operation affiliated with the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch — more closely resemble the traditional functions of a national political party than a network of private nonprofit groups.
The goal of the network is a long-term movement to expand the political playing field for conservatives — both into new states and into non-traditional demographics including millennial, Hispanic and low-income voters.
AFP's $125 million projected 2014 budget alone would also exceed the total 2012 fundraising hauls of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, National Republican Congressional Committee, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee or the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

As the Koch network prepares to gather its operatives and donors next month for an annual summer fundraising seminar, it's implementing a series of adjustments based on lessons learned from 2012. In the run-up to that election, the network spent more than $400 million only to watch President Barack Obama win reelection and their Democratic allies retain the Senate.
Some megadonors wondered what their cash bought, and privately suggested they might look to spend their money elsewhere. The Koch operation undertook a forensic analysis of what went wrong designed partly to prove to donors that it could be trusted with their political donations going forward.
AFP identified “three key areas where the Left outperformed our efforts in the field,” according to the memo, which conceded they were “tough and painful lessons — but it's important to remember that AFP is run like a business”:
• “Our data system was insufficient” and failed to quickly process information fed into it by thousands of canvassers and phone bankers contacting voters, causing “delays in updates, leading to some data inaccuracies during a critical phase of our organizing efforts.”
• “We were outmanned” by the left generally and Obama's campaign, specifically, which, the memo notes “had 770 field staff on the ground” in Florida alone. By contrast, the memo notes that AFP and “other network partners” had about 300 total field staff nationwide.
• “The Left had a superior messaging strategy and implementation that effectively identified their demographic targets, determined which issues resonated best with which groups, and delivered specific messages over TV, radio and online ads for those audiences.”
To remedy the messaging disadvantage, AFP developed “a sophisticated new media message-testing strategy to target specific demographics in specific locations we need to move on our issues,” according to the memo.
The resulting advertisements increasingly have used personal stories, often told by regular folks looking directly into the camera, to critique Democratic policies like Obamacare, and the politicians who support them. They're part of a broader effort to project a kinder, gentler tone in espousing libertarian-infused government-slashing policies that sometimes risk coming across as coldhearted.
( Also on POLITICO: Stalking the big donors)
“If the presidential election told us anything, it's that Americans place a great importance on taking care of those in need and avoiding harm to the weak,” reads the AFP memo.
Echoing Charles Koch's opposition to the minimum wage, it asserts that free market, low-regulation policies “create the greatest levels of prosperity and opportunity for all Americans, especially for society's poorest and most vulnerable.” Yet, the memo says, “we consistently see that Americans in general are concerned that free-market policy — and its advocates — benefit the rich and powerful more than the most vulnerable of society. …We must correct this misconception.”
The major contributors to the Koch network groups tend to skew much whiter and older than the population the groups are trying to reach. And while the emcee of the Koch donor seminars, Kevin Gentry, in April emailed a group of fundraisers for allied organizations that “we want our donors to be younger,” they added that “just doesn't track with reality. So if we try to ‘force' our donors to become younger – i.e., focusing our donor acquisition more at youth cohorts, we will likely have less efficient and less economically profitable fundraising.”

TRENTON — A Wall Street rating agency took a dim view of New Jersey's decision to let its controversial red light camera program expire.
Ending the program shuts down a revenue stream when local governments can ill afford it, Moody's Investors Service said in a statement, calling it “credit negative” in its weekly public finance credit outlook.
The expiration will "further constrain governments' ability to implement new revenue streams at a time when these governments are facing property tax limits, uneven sales tax growth and anti-tax sentiment,” Moody's said.
A credit negative assessment doesn't suggest a rating or outlook change is imminent, but rather assesses the impact of a single event, Moody's said.
The cameras went dark this week at 73 intersections in two dozen towns. They'd generated between 1 percent and 2 percent of local revenues for communities participating in the 5-year pilot program, according to Moody's.
The rating agency noted that the revenue is significant enough that Newark Mayor Ras Baraka is calling to resurrect them. Newark was home to the largest share of the state's 73 red light cameras.
Opponents said the program was too rigid and had caused an uptick in rear-end accidents, while supporters argued the cameras were leading to safer roads.
A technical glitch forced towns in August to throw out 17,000 fines issued from the cameras operated by Automated Traffic Solutions because drivers didn't actually receive the tickets.
Days earlier, the former CEO of New Jersey's other red light camera operator, Redflex, was indicted on federal corruption charges for the company's Chicago dealings.

THIS ultra-realistic sex doll can flirt and even fall in love with you, its makers claim.
A startling new video — that you can view above — shows the erotic robot, named Harmony 2.0, telling how they find sex “fascinating”.
And their chat is customisable, with 18 different personality traits ranging from “intellectual” and “shy” to “thrillseeking” and “sexual”.
That's according to RealDoll CEO and cyborg boffin Matt McCullen.
In a clip released on social media, they can be heard asking the robodoll: “How do you feel about sex?”
Harmony replies in a strangely Scottish accent: “Sex is one of the most fascinating things in the world. I don't think there is anything wrong with it”.
They even come with a “persistent memory” that allows them to build up relationships, it is claimed.
McMullen told the Daily Star: “The idea of the robot is to help someone find a level of companionship that they may not be able to achieve otherwise.
“You will be able to say to her: ‘I'm hungry, what should I eat?' and they would say: ‘Well you told me pizza is your favourite food maybe you should have that'.
“Once the robot is out you'll be able to connect the AI that's been created to the robot.”
One viewer on Instagram said: “Ask them how they feel about shopping now.
“If they don't care about it ... I'm sold ... Lol”.
According to The Daily Mail the silicon doll is created with a flexible skeleton and requires about 80 hours of work from start to finish, and even has customised genitalia and interchangeable faces.
Standard dolls come with the choice of 18 female body types, or two male figures.
Prices start at $US6,500 ($8,542) while more specific creations start at $12,000 ($15,780).

An elegy for Joey Boots

Howard Stern (Left) and Joey Boots at the Howard Stern Show
Joey Boots, a contributor to the Howard Stern show, died in their apartment this week at 49 years old. Many news sites have covered their death but as a fan of Howard Stern and the ecosystem of freaks and frequent callers and hangers-on surrounding the long-running morning radio show, I would like to try and eulogize Joey as the layered and interesting human being that they are. Joey Boots was many things besides being a small part of the Howard Stern Show. Those of us who are fans of Howard's got an opportunity to know Joey through the lens of the show as a man who overcame great adversity in their life to become an entertaining regular on the show. Boots was perhaps best known for yelling “Baba Booey! Howard Stern's Penis!” in the background, gonzo-style, of live news segments that were taking place in New York City. I have always found these small rebellions to be a delightfully subversive puncturing of the unreality of the contrived fakery of TV news.
Many of the news articles about Joey's death may even mention that Joey was something of a free speech hero. Joey got a case thrown out of court where they were charged for Disorderly Conduct for yelling their catchphrases during live news read and thus created good precedent for future rabble-rousers who like to rattle the cages of the TV news industry by savaging the stuffy reporters who otherwise would so confidently tell us what the important events of the day were on the evening telecasts. Yet other details may have also floated in the last few ‘graphs of some of these mainstream media accounts of the death of Joey Boots like some version of a story about how Boots had recently received a large settlement in a class action lawsuit where they were the lead plaintiff against Whole Foods. The suit alleged that Whole Foods was stiffing its customers by consistently putting less than the advertised weight of products in their food items.
What I would like to add to the ephemera of recollections online is something about their humanity. Joey was a closeted gay man for most of their life and they were also a decorated military veteran. In one of my favorite appearances of Joey's on the Stern show their military history was highlighted as we got a peek into Joey's world. Joey and High Pitch Erik competed in an event called the Craptacular which could only have existed in the demented world of Howard Stern. Before I explain what the Craptacular was all about, I must take a moment here to briefly describe the physiques of Boots and High Pitch Erik. The two were a matched set of couch-dwelling, all-you-can-eat buffet veterans who each had the distended gut and warped proportions that are becoming a commonplace in the fast food culture of early 21st century America. Howard was curious what Joey and Erik's bowel movements must weigh because of their terrible diets and so a contest was arranged and producers from the show were sent to Joey's apartment in Long Island to officially weigh the dumps Erik and Joey took in one 24-hour period. The night before Joey and Erik went to a Chinese restaurant buffet to load up on greasy morsels which took the bit to another level of grossness.
In their brilliant interviewing style, Howard teased out details of Joey and Erik's eating experience which serendipitously led to an exchange when Howard spotted a small display case of military medals in the background of Joey Boot's cluttered mess of an apartment. In a touching yet still deeply funny moment, Howard had Joey describe their military service and Joey reeled off the medals they had been awarded: military expedition medal, army good service, good conduct, army achievement medal, Naval deployment medal, armed forces service medal, expeditionary medal.
Joey's leg also noticeably shook as they discussed their service with Howard's co-host Robin Quivers, who was an Air Force Captain herself. Joey and Robin discussed why Joey left the service which lead to Joey revealing that they had PTSD and had to get out of the military after being deployed for 18 months during a two year period with training before their deployment. Howard instinctively moved the conversation back to the Craptacular:
“Are you ready? You feeling like you have to take a dump?”
“No. Not yet. Within the hour, though, it's definitely… I've got a round in the chamber. It's going to get ready to get loose. Uh… I'm gonna… I'm gonna…” Joey stammered in response.
“You going to win this thing?” Asked Howard.
“Howard, I'm going to win it for you. You've got 200 dollars on me. That means you have faith in me. Robin has 200 dollars on me. They have faith in me. I'm doing it for the both of you guys. I appreciate your support.” Joey earnestly replied, adding a leavening pinch of emotion to the otherwise ridiculous Craptacular.
There was also a photo of Joey in their military days inside of the medal display. The photo was from ten years earlier and Joey looked like an entirely different person with the military fatigues and a jaunty beret on their head. Joey's face was much leaner and was missing the double chins and puffiness that had been added in the intervening years. Joey mentioned they were one of the first 500 U.S. troops into Bosnia which was a reference to the Bosnian War that took place between 1992 and 1995 after the break-up of the Soviet Union. The War was part of the disintegration of Yugoslavia when Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence. This was the conflict that brought Slobodan Milosevic to prominence when they and the Yugoslav People's Army began an ethnic cleansing of local Bosniak Muslims and Catholic Croats. It is estimated that 100,000 people died during the war and an additional 2.2 million were displaced and the conflict was only finally squelched by NATO intervening in 1995. So Joey Boots was part of one of the few worthwhile conflicts that American forces were involved in during the 20th century.
Joseph Bassolino, Joey's given name, reached the rank of corporal in the Army serving in the 2nd Battalion, 67th Armored Division. Boots served from 1992 to 1998 in the military ironically during the exact time that the “Don't ask, Don't tell” policy became official. I say ironically because Joey Boots was a gay man and they of course had to suppress this part of themselves while in the military. They didn't come out until revealing that they were gay on the June 28th, 2007 edition of the Howard Stern Show when they were around 40 years old.
Joey was part of a generation of veterans that were especially hard hit by suicide and depression which probably had a lot to do with modern medicine and reporting statistics as well as the callous disregard of the U.S. military brass that was especially notable during the era that Joey served in. In the military's own documents, the statistics regarding veteran suicides are staggering for this most recent generation of soldiers. In their 2012 report on suicide, the Department of Veteran's Affairs found that at least 22% of all suicides reported in the U.S. were by veterans while veterans only make up a little less than 10% of the population. The report estimated that 22 veterans died from suicide every day in 2010. In a 2016 VA suicide prevention fact sheet, the rate of suicide for veterans in 2014 is listed as 35.3 per 100,000. The rate for U.S. civilian adults is 15.2 per 100,000 so the rate is more than twice as high for vets.
The Era that Joey Boots served in, the 90's, was an era where the iron hand came out of the velvet glove in some respects in terms of military tactics for U.S. armed forces. In the gulf war the U.S. began using depleted uranium munitions and the Pentagon estimates that at least 860,000 depleted uranium rounds were fired during the gulf war which left behind an ongoing legacy of radioactive filth that will still be contaminating whatever it comes in contact with long after our species has winked out of existence. These rounds are so toxic and lethal that studies have indicated they are a teratogen or an agent that causes birth defects. The gulf war-era is also notable for the eponymous syndrome that affected over a third, again by the government's own numbers, of the 700,000 that served in that era. Gulf War Syndrome includes a range of chronic symptoms that include fatigue, joint pain, insomnia, respiratory disorders, memory problems and migraines. In addition to the depleted uranium rounds, soldiers of Joey's generation were also exposed to many other harmful chemicals like anti-nerve agents and pesticides that the army used as well as the belching oil fires that often engulfed the conflict zones.
Joey Boots was a funny person and like many funny people they used humor to find something redeeming in the dark aspects of their life. They were thoroughly human with parts of them that were noble and parts of them that were broken. They served their country and they served the listening audience with their gruff Long Island accent that belied a layered and complex person who had been battered by the gauntlet of mechanized warfare. In the end the irony that they may have finally come to some peace of mind in the form of financial stability and the acceptance of their true nature by society just in the last few passing moments is pretty much how their entire life seemed to play out. Here's to you, Joey Boots. You will be missed.
Image caption Thousands of South Korean tourists used to travel each year to Mt Kumgang
The opening of North Korea's Mount Kumgang to South Korean tourists led to hope, bordering on euphoria, of reconciliation between the two hostile states.
The North's decision to seize South Korean assets at the tourist resort site and expel the remaining Southern officials looks like a dismal end for the project.
A North Korean spokesperson accused the South of breaking its agreements over the resort.
"There will be neither magnanimity nor generosity for such hooligans ...the puppet group has no intention to resume the tour of Mt Kumgang and is using noble tourism for the purpose of confrontation," the spokesperson said.
The resort opened in 1998. Then, for the first time in almost half a century, South Koreans were allowed to enter the once hermetically-sealed North of the peninsula.
First they came by boat, but within a few years, thousands of visitors were crossing by land through the front lines of the world's most heavily-fortified border.
There are still no telephone or postal links between the two states and unauthorised contacts between individuals are strictly forbidden.
Image caption The route to the resort was tightly controlled to restrict interaction between tourists and locals
But each day, convoys of tourist buses would snake through the demilitarised zone - a once unimaginable journey through a no-man's land of tank traps and minefields, flanked by two of the world's largest armies.
The apparent success of the Mt Kumgang resort was the high-water mark of South Koreas "sunshine policy" - an attempt to prise the North out of its isolation by encouraging economic co-operation and personal contacts.
But the reality was never as encouraging as the rhetoric. South Koreans were only allowed onto clearly marked trails in an isolated mountain wilderness just north of the DMZ. Contact with the population was out of the question.
Bewildering experience
Before leaving the South, the visitors were ordered to hand over their mobile phones, computers and newspapers to their guides.
They were warned not to take photographs on the journey and to avoid any sensitive topics during encounters with the small number of North Korean "guides" they would encounter on the trails.
It was a bewildering and disheartening experience for many of the South Korean tourists - up to 300,000 a year - who had dreamed of national reunification or finding long-lost relatives.
They found everything was immediately and depressingly different on the other side, even inside the demilitarised zone itself. The Northern half is barren and eroded, cleared of the lush foliage to open up fields of fire for the army.
The road - built exclusively for the tourists - was sealed off from the North Korean countryside by a high wire fence. The designated tourist zone at the foot of Mt Kumgang's trails was also fenced off.
Armed North Korean soldiers with red flags stood at the entrance of neighbouring North Korean villages.
Get too close and a guard would angrily wave their flag and slap the gun at theirs side.
Shot dead
It became clear that the North Koreans wanted money from the South Koreans - a fixed sum for each visitor - but would do everything possible to prevent meaningful contact between people.
Image caption The Mt Kumgang project was a key symbol of inter-Korean rapprochement
In 2008, tragedy occurred. A 53-year-old South Korean woman was shot dead by one of the guards and the South Koreans suspended the tours.
Hopes for reconciliation were already on the slide. The conservative government of President Lee Myung-bak in South Korea had reversed the "sunshine policy" of their liberal predecessors.
They cut the big annual shipments of free rice to the North. Such largesse would now be conditional on the North Koreans shutting down their nuclear weapons programmes.
North Korea's decision to seize the tourist complex at Mount Kumgang underlines the return to confrontation. It follows North Korea's artillery attack on a South Korean island last year and allegations that it sunk a South Korean warship.
But optimists in the South say that all is not lost.
Both sides still appear committed to the other big joint project - at the opposite, western, end of the DMZ.
There 120 South Korean firms continue to produce light industrial products at the Kaesong industrial park.
Some 46,000 North Koreans are employed at the factories earning just over $60 a month. There have been disputes and the North Koreans have, on occasion, blocked access across the DMZ.
But Kaesong is a source of badly-needed hard currency for the North, and the South Koreans have plans to keep their industry competitive by exploiting vastly cheaper Northern labour.
The two sides are still reluctant to sacrifice those benefits on the altar of tit-for-tat diplomacy.
But the North Koreans do appear to have given up hope of extracting further financial gains from the South, at least while President Lee remains in power.
The state media has reverted to old insults in its references to the South - denouncing the government as puppets, thieves and hooligans.
Looking elsewhere
North Korea is now looking to its closest ally, China, to revive the tourism project - although without the emotional draw of national brotherhood and reunification, it is doubtful the area will have much appeal to Chinese tourists.
Kim Jong-il has gone to Russia to seek aid and economic co-operation with Moscow and the North Korean leadership is also sending possible signals to the United States.
North Korea is well practiced at playing off its neighbours against each other and exploiting regional rivalries.
The concern is that some in the leadership will want to go further and punish the South Koreans for their defiance.
In recent years, when tensions have been high across the DMZ, it has felt the need to test ballistic missiles and nuclear devices to show off its destructive power.
Workers who earn minimum wage at retailers open on Thanksgiving Day can thank fallout from the government shutdown for being on the job that day. A record number of retailers will allow consumers to spend during an unprecedented number of hours on America's most storied holiday this year. Though this trend of “Black Friday Creep” is not new, it is reaching new heights and being driven by errant decisions in Washington.
To be fair, since the 2008 recession, Thanksgiving has been slowly transforming into a shopping day that marks the start of the holiday retail season. But the collapse in consumer confidence after the shuttering of the government in October and the rollback in government food assistance just weeks ago, has unnerved retailers and pushed them to extend hours to unseen limits. That's because without a successful holiday season the retail business simply doesn't make economic sense.
According to the Retail Federation of America, sales between Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Eve account for up to 40 percent of a store's annual sales. Those four weeks are when consumer businesses swing into profit. They essentially underwrite operations for the previous 11 months.
The lack of a gangbusters holiday season translates into serious trouble for retailers.
In fact, Black Friday–the historic beginning to the most important shopping season of the year–is called such because it was once the beginning of the time when retailers moved from yearly losses, or “red,” into making money, or “black.” Spurred by an economy that cratered six years ago, “Black Friday” has given way to Thanksgiving Day as the start of it all.
This year retailers are so worried about holiday sales that, according to The Wall Street Journal, they cranked up holiday marketing campaigns earlier than last year, starting before Halloween. By the end of October they'd reached 35 percent more consumers with store ads and gifts than the same period of time last October.
Why the panic?
Before the government shutdown retailers were poised to have a strong 2013 holiday season. Forecasts put sales 4 percent higher than last year–twice the growth rate of the economy–and consumers were set to spend $786 on gifts this year. But the 17-day government shutdown changed all that.
During the D.C. showdown two million federal workers–disproportionately people of color–and the families that depend on them were denied vital pay at a critical point in the pre-holiday season. The government shutdown ultimately sucked $25 billion out of the economy.
The consequence of this economic earthquake is that it pushed consumer confidence in the month of October to lows not not seen in two years.
Adding to the worry of consumers and retailers is the fact that on Nov. 1, SNAP food assistance–which helps one out of five working poor recipients with food costs–was slashed. This move took an additional $5 billion from the pockets of potential holiday shoppers and removed $8.5 billon in overall economic benefit right before the start of the crucial shopping season.
It's no surprise then that between the shutdown and the rollback in SNAP, Americans slashed their holiday budgets by 10 percent, telling Gallup this month that they plan to spend $704 on gifts instead of the $786 that stores and chains had been counting on.
Responding to the reversal of consumer sentiment and budgets, retailers decided to open their stores earlier than ever with the hope of enticing more shoppers to spend. They announced the change during the same week in November when disappointing consumer confidence data were released and when SNAP benefits were cut.
The problem is that extended hours may not be enough for retailers to hit their profit numbers. With real wages at a 40-year low and the actual value of the current minimum wage lower than in 1968, the reality of workers' earning power might just be catching up to holiday sales.
“I think until the issues are resolved that are making news these days, we're not going to see a very large rebound in the middle of the economy and in consumer confidence,” Walmart U.S. CEO Bill Simon told The New York Times.
But whether this holiday season will ultimately surprise everyone is unknown at this point. According to business channel CNBC, “factors such as the growth in online shopping, rising home values, a stock market that continues to reach new highs and gas prices at their lowest holiday levels in four years” could lead to an unexpected turnaround.
This might be true, but regardless of how the holiday season turns out, tens of millions of struggling workers will have to report working this Thursday in order to ensure that companies meet their financial targets, which were jeopardized by actions in Washington. The rough beginning to the holiday season for retail workers is yet another casualty of the ongoing Budget War in the nation's capital.
"Every time they attached I would brace myself for that zing of pain that would travel right through my breast."
To The Pharmacist Who Sold Me Baby Formula,
It was a cold Saturday morning, and I was at the end of my tether. I'd gotten out of bed, dressed, and left my baby daughter with my husband in order to walk to the chemist and buy a tin of baby formula. I was familiar with the horror stories that some mothers had told on parenting forums about feeling judged or shamed by doing the exact same thing, and I hoped I wouldn't get the same kind of service and, even if I did, I was sure as hell not going to take it.
I'd been breastfeeding for just over a month. It was hell. It was cracked nipple hell. Every time they attached I would brace myself for that zing of pain that would travel right through my breast. I'd narrowly averted one bout of mastitis but knew another was probably right around the corner if we didn't nail the whole 'fore and hind milk' deal. The maternal health nurse drove this point home when, upon describing Keira's 'frothy poos', they also said I needed to be careful. I was so close to being done and I just wanted that little bit of solace, or insurance, to help me get through "just in case".
I looked dreadful – I was in dirty grey tracksuit pants and a yellow hoodie. The chemist was jammed with people, thanks to it being a Saturday as well as cold-and-flu season. I wandered over to the baby section and stood before the options in a state of bewilderment. What should I choose? What was best? I hadn't done any research. Just as I was about to walk out again I saw you approach me, from the direction of the dispensary. Tall, be-speckled, and with a friendly face you asked, "Can I help?"
With the purest concentration of willpower I could muster in order to stop myself from crying, I explained – briefly – my predicament. What did you think?
The first thing you did was reach out and pull a tin off the shelf. I couldn't even say now what brand or kind it was, all I remember was taking it from you and, after I cradled it under my arm, was readying my thanks because I thought you would turn on your heel to get back to the other waiting customers.
But, no. You kept talking to me. You engaged with me, asked questions. How old was my baby? (A month) Was they getting enough milk? (Yes) But you're not adjusting? (No) The only caution you gave, spoken without any guilt-inducting tone, was this: "Just remember, the more you go down this road, the harder it can be to keep up your own milk supply".
I nodded and said, "I understand. But frankly, at this point, I need this. Options are important."
They smiled and nodded. "Yes, I agree."
I looked at my watch (I still had one back then) and stuttered, "I'm sorry, we've been standing here twenty minutes. I'm sure you need to get back."
"I do. Good luck."
I watched them leave, navigating their way around the crowd to get back to their former position.
Standing there, I felt thankful, for so many things. That I could even afford a tin of formula, that I had easy access to it. That I had been able to buy it without being made to feel like a failure if that was the route we ended up taking, and for that, I have you to thank.
At the checkout, I asked the assistant who rang up the purchase, hopefully without sounding too creepy, "Who's the pharmacist?" What's their story? was my silent question. "He was very kind to me."
"That's X. Isn't they great? They have a young family of their own. He's a great help to new parents."
I arrived home that day, put that tin on the table and stared at it for a long time before I put it away in the cupboard.
One more week, I told myself. That's the six week mark. I'll keep trying until then. And then we'll see.
And wouldn't you know it, in that week, Keira and I got sorted out. We clicked. I smothered my nipples in lanolin, relaxed a little, healed a little, and the breastfeeding took a turn for the better.
I didn't wean them until a year later. That achievement (and what I was similarly able to do for Riley) still ranks among my proudest achievements.
Dear Pharmacist X – you sure were a help, and I've never forgotten that. As fate would have it, our two youngest are in the same grade at school. On the rare occasion I catch sight of you at school, or around town, I think back to our earliest exchange. I'm sure you have no recollection of it at all.
But that's the beauty of small gestures – they live longer in the taker than the giver.
Thank you for yours, to me.

The damning United Nations report shown to the Guardian newspaper alleges that French soldiers deployed in the Central African Republic (CAR) have been sexually abusing the very children they are supposed to be protecting.
The UN report entitled Sexual Abuse on Children by International Armed Forces details the rape and sodomy of starving and homeless boys as young as nine, by French peacekeeping troops.
The troops were supposed to be protecting the children at a centre for internally displaced people in the country's capital Bangui.
The report, stamped confidential on each page, was leaked to the Guardian newspaper and has led to the suspension of a senior UN aid worker, who is believed to be behind the leak.
The aid worker named Anders Kompass, a Swedish national based in Geneva, is believed to have initially passed the report on to French authorities because the UN had proved powerless to stop the ongoing abuse.
Kompass, who is registered at an address in Stockholm, has been involved in humanitarian work for more than 30 years.
They were suspended from their post last week, according to The Guardian.
The Swedish Foreign Ministry's legal chief Anders Rönquist said in a written statement to Swedish broadcaster SVT that they were aware of Kompass' removal from their post, pending a UN inquiry.
But they added that it was "worrying" that evidence suggested their suspension was linked to them leaking information about child sex crimes.
"The UN must have zero tolerance for sexual abuse and act to make sure suspicions of such abuses are investigated," they said.
The Guardian was given its copy of the internal report by Paula Donovan, from the organisation Aids Free World.
Donovan is now demanding an independent inquiry into the abuse and the UN's handling of the allegations.
“The regular sex abuse by peacekeeping personnel uncovered here and the United Nations' appalling disregard for victims are stomach-turning, but the awful truth is that this isn't uncommon,” Donovan told The Guardian.
France announced in March that it was reducing its troop numbers in the Central African Republic as it gradually hands over to a 8,500-strong UN peacekeeping force brought in to contain a deadly sectarian conflict.
The Local has requested France's ministry of defence response to the allegations in the report and has contacted Kompass for comment.
Jeremy Mincey is still fresh off of one of the best seasons from a defensive end for a Jaguars player in several years and, according to a source, the team wants to make sure they stay in Jacksonville.
While the two sides have not yet sat down to negotiate and have not talked contract figures at all to this point, the Jaguars were also set back by a head coaching search and the filling of the coaching staff that followed shortly thereafter. Now they will turn their attention to their own free agents, beginning with Mincey, whom they will likely begin negotiations with in the coming days.
The possibility remains that the Jaguars could use the franchise tag on Mincey, although there is a stronger likelihood that Josh Scobee would receive the tag if the team is unable to agree to a long-term deal with the kicker.
There have been reports, namely one from Vito Stellino last month, that Mincey isn't willing to take a hometown discount to stay in Jacksonville, but that may be a gross exaggeration of a postgame quote from Mincey following the Jaguars' 19-13 victory against the Colts in week 17 in which they finished with 2.5 sacks.
The Jaguars have until Tuesday, March 13 to come to a deal with free agents before the 2012 NFL Free Agency period officially begins. The period in which teams can use the franchise tag runs from Feb. 20 until March 5.
U.S. Justice Department officials are expected to announce indictments on Wednesday against suspects in at least one of a series of hacking attacks on Yahoo Inc (yhoo), according to a source briefed on the matter.
The accused men live in Russia and Canada, the source said, with the Canadian far more likely to face arrest. Russia has no extradition treaty with the United States.
For more about Yahoo, watch Fortune's video:
It could not immediately be learned whether the accused are suspected in the hacking of data about 1 billion Yahoo users, or a separate hack of 500 million email accounts.
The indictments were first reported by Bloomberg News. Yahoo and the Justice Department declined to comment.
The two largest hacks, and Yahoo's much-criticized slow response and disclosure, forced a discount of $350 million in what had been a $4.83 billion deals to sell Yahoo's main assets to Verizon Communications Inc (vz).
A joke for you, Fellow Reckoner: How many Senators does it take to change a light bulb? Oh, wait, we've got a better one: How many Senators does it take to dismantle a cryptographically secured, completely decentralized, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network of voluntary, free market traders exchanging goods and services across six continents using tens, perhaps hundreds, of thousands of individual computers and some of the most advanced cyber technology and software coding known to date?
Answer: we don't know…but Senators Charles Schumer (D, New York) and Joe Manchin (D, West Virginia), seemingly immune to common ignominy, have taken on the challenge anyway.
Your editor has no idea of the cybercryptography aptitude of the two senators but, as with most endeavors undertaken by politicians in the name of "your own damned good," practical experience and a sufficient understanding of the issue at hand are rarely prerequisites for intervention, again, "on your (unsolicited) behalf."
The two erstwhile wonks took to the presses this week, demanding something be done about one particular free-market affront to authority.
We are referring, of course, to the latest furor surrounding bitcoin, a P2P cyber currency setting the virtual - and, some would argue, actual - world ablaze. (We first brought you the story a couple of weeks ago, when bitcoins were trading for roughly B$1 = US$7.5. As of this morning, they've shot up to B$1 = US$31.5. See "An Emerging Free Market Currency" and "How Governments Distort the Value of Money" for a "bit" of background about them and about the pitfalls of government-backed currencies in general.)
Long story short, bitcoin is a limited supply, decentralized digital currency; a free market alternative to state issued notes and coins. As such, it poses a direct - though entirely non-violent - threat to the state's monopoly on counterfeiting. This, cry the powers that be, must not be tolerated. Of course, before any politico can act, they must first have a distraction, a fall boy, a pretense, a reason for rescuing us from the horror that is our own decision-making capacity. We picked it in that first column, the relevant portion of which is reprised here:
Another cause for concern among bitcoin skeptics is that, as the economy of the free market currency expands it will inevitably begin posing a threat to the state's own money-printing racket. It will, thereby, raise the ire of bankers and politicians who will have every incentive to make the currency illegal in order that they may protect their own monopoly and continue cheating their citizens of the value of their president-stamped notes and coins. Given the state's nature when it comes to these matters (and here we refer readers to the recent and despicable case against Bernard von NotHaus) there is every reason to expect that it will indeed crack down…and hard.
Here we expect all the usual arguments from all the usual suspects: "Bitcoin transactions are anonymous and therefore provide cover for peddlers of child pornography and drug traffickers," they will contend.
But the astute reader knows in their gut there is something very wrong with this line of thinking right from the beginning. Cash is anonymous too. People by things deemed illegal by the state with state-issued currency all the time. So what? Does this mean US dollars should be banned? Some people drive their cars recklessly, with little or no regard for their own safety or for others'. Should we ban cars?
The question, however, is not whether the Feds should do something (moral considerations have rarely, if ever, stopped them before), but whether they could do something, even if they wanted to…
Now that we have a little background, let's get back to those busybody senators. As one might imagine, a virtually untraceable currency - such as bitocin or…umm…CASH! - might find use as a medium of exchange to purchase both white and black market products like, say, drugs. Such was the case with Silk Road, a website where users (literally) can buy illegal substances with bitcoin.
Said Senator Chuck of Silk Road and bitcoin in a news conference on Sunday:
"Literally, it allows buyers and users to sell illegal drugs online, including heroin, cocaine, and meth, and users do sell by hiding their identities through a program that makes them virtually untraceable." Apparently, the senator wants Silk Road shut down immediately with bitcoin, no doubt, soon to follow. The pair have written to Attorney General Eric Holder and the DEA asking that action be taken to crackdown on Silk Road.
Now that the pair have their straw man, we can be sure it will be used as a pretense to attack free-market currencies themselves. Stay tuned as the story unfolds on that front…
For now, we wonder what users of bitcoin are to do now that the self-appointed invigilators of free market activity are on their case? Well, for the past few weeks at least, they've been rejoicing. The currency has almost quadrupled in value since the Silk Road issue came to the fore.
Bitcoin enthusiasts may wish, therefore, to thank Senators Schumer and Manchin for, without their commitment to proffering illogical, largely ignorant remarks in the nation's mainstream press, bitcoin might have taken a while longer to reach the critical mass on which it must now surely be verging. "Bravo, Senators," we can almost here the cyber underground chorus, "Thanks for the free publicity!"

The San Diego Chargers have rejected several trade offers for wide receiver Vincent Jackson, letting the Wednesday deadline to trade them pass without making a deal.
In a text message to the NFL Network, Jackson said they believe the way the Chargers are handling the situtation is "unethical."
"I just don't understand why [a trade didn't happen]," they texted. "They obviously think I'm a valuable player by asking for such high trade compensation, but why am I only offered tender salary?
"My agents and teams interested did everything to make it happen, but this organization stopped it. I just want to play football. It feels unethical and I am disappointed."
The NFL and the NFL Players Association had agreed to a 4 p.m. ET deadline for San Diego to trade Jackson, which would have allowed them to be active by the fifth week of the regular season. Jackson is under a three-game suspension for past DUI offenses. When they did not sign their restricted free-agent tender, the Chargers placed Jackson on an exempt list, which prohibited them from playing for three more weeks.
By letting Wednesday's deadline pass, the Chargers will keep Jackson on the exempt list for the first six weeks of the season. San Diego still can trade them by the Oct. 19 trade deadline.
"We had multiple offers, and the Chargers squashed them all," said Jonathan Feinsod, one of Jackson's agents.
The Minnesota Vikings were willing to give up a second-round draft choice and an additional conditional pick to the Chargers, a source said. Another source said Jackson had even worked out a financial package with the Vikings.

The federal government says a plan by early childhood educators to strike next month for better pay is nothing more than a political stunt.
Parents are being asked to keep their children at home on March 27 so educators can send a message about how seriously they feel about equal pay.
They say the action comes after the federal government failed to meet a February 1 deadline set by their union to deliver funding for equal pay.
"Malcolm Turnbull has driven educators to take this extreme step as they continue to ignore their demand for equal pay," United Voice assistant national secretary Helen Gibbons said on Sunday.
Childcare workers - predominantly women - are paid half the average weekly wage which can no longer be tolerated, they said. The industry is pushing for a 30 per cent pay rise for workers.
But Education and Training Minister Simon Birmingham on Monday described the strike action as a political stunt.
"United Voice should well understand - as the union, an integral part of the Labor Party - that wage rates, minimum wage rates and conditions aren't set by the government, they're set by the independent umpire, the Fair Work Commission," the senator told ABC Radio.
"The government doesn't employ any child care workers or early childhood educators. We don't run any child care centres or early learning centres.
"It's nothing more than a political stunt for United Voice to set some arbitrary deadline for the government to allegedly intervene in something that is determined by the independent industrial umpire."
But Ms Gibbons says that because parents can't afford to pay any more for education the federal government should step in and fund the sector properly.
"Parents across Australia know very clearly where the blame for this lies," Ms Gibbons said on Sunday.
The union boss says the situation is an escalating crisis. The March strike will be the third nationwide walk-off in the past 12 months.
More than 3000 childcare workers last walked out of centres nationwide on September 7.
We all saw this coming.
On Monday, 10 ex-NHLers filed a class action lawsuit against the league and its board of governors. The plaintiffs feel as though the NHL did not properly treat head injuries, and that they deserve compensation for the lower quality of life they are left with, once the long-term effects of repeated head trauma kicks in.
This is not just about concussions, but also the repeated sub-concussions that are a result of repeated blows to the head. These blows occur very often in games and practice, and can have a devastating impact on brain function.
There's some interesting stuff in the court filing, one of them mentioning a study done 85 years ago by pathologist Harrison Martland, that looked at boxers and linked blows to the head with degenerative brain disease. Frankly, that leads me to believe that the players should have been at least somewhat aware of the risks they were taking.
The filing also mentions the Concussion Program, started by the NHL in 1997, which was essentially when the NHL first started keeping track of concussions, and the first time the league installed baseline brain testing procedures. The NHL then studied the results, which spanned up until the end of the 2003-2004.
According to the players, the League didn't do a good enough job with these studies, and was dishonest about the results, which were only released in 2011. The players feel as though they were not warned adequately about the risks they undertook. If they can prove that the NHL intentionally withheld important information about concussions, sub-concussions, and their long-term effects, then the NHL truly have something to worry about.
Predictably, the NHL disagrees with the players, and will most likely put up a fight through the media, defending their actions (or lack of action) before settling the case with a large sum of money. This all comes three months after the NFL settled a very similar lawsuit with 450 ex-players for $756 million, so there is a precedent for this type of case.
While not always known, the long-term effects of repeated trauma to the head can be devastating. Research is still ongoing and the possibility of certain genetic traits being more susceptible to concussions is being explored in numerous studies. For the NHL, it is now undertaking the difficult task of making the game safer, while not alienating the demographic of fans who are drawn to the violence and toughness the sport of hockey has to offer.
For many former athletes, the lingering effects of blows to the head significantly hamper their quality of life. Memory loss, mood swings, and a decrease in cognitive ability are just some of the symptoms they have to deal with. They surely knew their occupation brought with it some dangers, but perhaps not at this scale. Many of the coaches who played players who were suffering from brain injuries were probably former players themselves.
For those wondering, the actual ten players who filed the lawsuit are: Gary Leeman, Brad Aitken, Darren Banks, Curt Bennett, Richie Dunn, Warren Holmes, Bob Manno, Blair Stewart, Morris Titanic, Ric Vaive. It will be interesting to see who else joins in.

"I have asked the groundwater recharge authorities to collect information, detect and revive the water sources and the roots of the river. Saraswati is not a myth but scientific evidence is now available to prove its existence," Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti said.
They were responding to a calling attention motion moved by BJP member Rattan Lal Kataria on the need to set up a Saraswati Research Institute for "revival of the river Saraswati".
Bharti said a lot of research has been done on the river, particularly in Gujarat.
They said there were several rivers named Saraswati which emanated from the Himalayas, including one which mingled with the Triveni in Allahabad, another with Mandakini and the third with Alaknanda rivers.
There was also a river with the same name that passed through Haryana to Rajasthan and Gujarat, they said and urged members to share any information with their Ministry so that the groundwater sources could be used.
Raising the issue, Katariya said Saraswati river was a symbol of India's cultural heritage and part of the civilisation that grew up in Mohenjodaro and Harappa as it flowed from the Himalayas along with the other historic river, Indus. However, the river dried up due to natural reasons.
They said drilling of deep wells in parts of Gujarat had shown the existence of sweet water, which proved the existence of water flow.
Maintaining that research work on the river would also act as a search for lost civilisations and habitations, Katariya demanded the establishment of an authority to carry on the research. Latest News from India News Desk
A new Associated Press-NORC poll released on Thursday shows that most Americans disapprove of Trump's performance as president. (Susan Walsh/AP)
A trigger warning at the outset: This article relies on polls. If your reaction to that is something like “but the polls were wrong last year about Trump and therefore this should be ignored!!,” that is, of course your prerogative. That said, Trump led in national primary polling for every single day save two from July 2015 through their nomination. General election polling had them consistently down nationally, and they lost the popular vote by 1.1 fewer points than polling averages indicated.
If Donald Trump wants to be worried about anything — and their Twitter feed of late indicates that they do — they might want to begin with their political base of support.
It's early both in terms of Trump's presidency and of a trend of Trump's base eroding, but, as we all know, it's better to accept and confront problems early instead of pretending they don't exist. So while two polls released this week aren't dead canaries in the coal mine, someone might want to take these canaries to the vet.
A new Associated Press-NORC poll released on Thursday shows that most Americans disapprove of Trump's performance as president. That's not new. What's new is that the AP shows a big drop in Trump's net approval rating, that is, the percent who approve of the job he's doing minus those who don't. In March, Trump's net approval was minus-16. Now it's nearly twice as big.
We've also seen huge disapproval numbers from Democrats before. But Trump's approval among Republicans is only 75 percent, a significantly lower figure than we've seen in other polls. This is one poll, and we should never try to build a broad case on one poll. But there's other evidence at hand.
For example: Since March, the percentage of Americans who approve of Trump's handling of key political issues has slipped across the board. That includes on the economy, an issue which Trump has repeatedly indicated is their core strength and the metric by which they should be judged. In March, half the country approved of their handling of the economy. In the new poll, that's fallen to 43 percent.
Meanwhile, Gallup released new monthly numbers on America's satisfaction with the way things are going in the country. Since May, the percentage of Republicans who express satisfaction with the direction of the country has plunged 17 points. It's clearly a reflection in part of Trump; when they were inaugurated, satisfaction among Republicans jumped by twice that much.
One of the key arguments that Trump made on the campaign trail last year was that most Americans thought the country was on the wrong track. Most Americans still feel that way, and the percentage who said they did climb from March through the early part of this month.
Americans were growing more pessimistic — although that trend has reversed a bit of late.
That's the whole thing with polling: They are snapshots of moments, not complete films. For Trump, though, an erosion in support is particularly bad news, because it's safe to assume that members of their party who are up for reelection next year are paying close attention to how strongly Republican voters feel about him. If they become a severe liability for Republicans in Congress, the ramifications could be severe.
We're not there yet. The question is whether Trump keep driving toward that cliff, Thelma-and-Louise style, or if they (or someone else) finally turns the wheel.
The BBC should be “cut back to the bone”, Nigel Farage has told reporters during a walkabout in Kent. The UKIP leader said the license fee should be roughly a third of its current level, bringing it down from £145.50 to £48.50
According to the Daily Express Nigel Farage said: “I would like to see the BBC cut back to the bone to be purely a public service broadcaster with an international reach and I would have thought you could do that with a licence fee that was about a third of what it currently is.”
There have already been moves to cut back on the enormous cost and scope of the BBC. Tory backbencher Andrew Bridgen successfully amended the Deregulation Bill last year to decriminalise non-payment of the License Fee. At the time they claimed the “vast majority” of uncontested cases before magistrates courts were related to non-payment of the License Fee.
Farage's comments came as the BBC was forced to admit less than a third of the audience at the Opposition Leaders' Debate supported right-wing parties. The corporation brought in the pollsters ICM to select the audience. They brought in people from the London region, which is traditionally much more left-wing than the rest of England.
ICM also used the following ratio to pick them: Conservative 5, Labour 5, Lib Dem 4, UKIP 3, SNP 2, Green 2 and Plaid 1. In reality the combined support for the political right in the UK is much higher than this ratio gives them credit for.
The BBC has also been under pressure recently because of the sacking of Jeremy Clarkson. The Top Gear presenter was pushed out of the corporation for a minor altercation with a producer. Clarkson is now suing the BBC because one of their spokesperson compared them to the paedophile Jimmy Saville.
Drinkmore Cafe, Seattle.
The Drinkmore Cafe is a coffee shop on Capitol Hill in Seattle, Washington. Opened on April 1, 2000 as the Bit Star,[1] it was reported by InfoWorld to be the first commercial business to offer free wireless internet wifi services. Although few had the equipment necessary to take advantage of this, free wireless internet became a major component of the small coffee shop business model across America. Owned and run by software executive and Seattle mayoral candidate Scott Kennedy, The Drinkmore was the headquarters of Seattle Wireless and was the Howard Dean meetup spot during their 2004 presidential campaign.
The original location, a 1905 warehouse at the corner of Bellevue Avenue East and Thomas Street, was demolished by the property owner to make way for new condominiums.[1]

Almost every Democrat in the US Senate just voted to keep Test and Punish.
But Republicans defeated them.
I know. I feel like I just entered a parallel universe, too. But that's what happened.
Some facts:
No Child Left Behind (NCLB) is a disaster.
It took the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) – a federal law designed to ensure all schools get equitable resources and funding – and turned it into a law about standardized testing and punishing schools that don't measure up.
This was a Republican policy proposed by President George W. Bush.
But now that the ESEA is being rewritten, those pushing to keep the same horrendous Bush era policies are the Democrats.
Almost all of the Democrats!
That includes so-called far left Dems like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren!
It comes down to the Murphy Amendment, a Democratically sponsored change to the ESEA.
This provision was an attempt to keep as many Test and Punish policies as possible in the Senate rewrite.
The amendment, “reads more like NCLB, with its detailed prescription for reporting on student test results, for ‘meaningfully differentiating among all public schools' (i.e., grading schools), including publicly identifying the lowest five percent, and, among interventions, potentially firing staff and offering students the option to transfer to other schools and using part of the budget to pay for the transportation,” according to blogger Mercedes Schneider.
Education historian Diane Ravich adds, “This amendment would have enacted tough, federal-mandated accountability, akin to setting up an ‘achievement school district' in every state.”
Thankfully it was voted down. The ESEA will probably not be affected. The rewrite was passed by both the House and Senate without these provisions. Once the two versions of the bill are combined, it is quite possible – maybe even probable – that we'll have a slight improvement on NCLB. Sure there is plenty of crap in it and plenty of lost opportunities, but the ESEA rewrite looks to be a baby step in the right direction.
The problem is this: the failed Murphy Amendment shows the Democrats' education vision. Almost all of them voted for it. Warren even co-sponsored it!
When it was defeated and the Senate approved the ESEA rewrite, Warren released a statement expressing their disapproval. But if you didn't know about the Murphy Amendment, you could have read their criticisms quite differently.
They say the (ESEA rewrite) “eliminates basic, fundamental safeguards to ensure that federal dollars are actually used to improve both schools and educational outcomes for those students who are often ignored.”
That sounds good until you realize what they mean. “Educational outcomes” mean test scores. She's talking about test-based accountability.  They are against the ESEA rewrite because it doesn't necessarily put strings on schools' funding based on standardized test scores like NCLB.
They continue, “Republicans have blocked every attempt to establish even minimum safeguards to ensure that money would be used effectively. I am deeply concerned that billions in taxpayer dollars will not actually reach those schools and students who need them the most…”
 They are upset because Republicans repeatedly stripped away federal power to Test and Punish schools. The GOP gave that power to the states. So Warren is concerned that somewhere in this great nation there may be a state or two that decides NOT to take away funding if some of their schools have bad test scores! God forbid!
And Warren's about as far left as they come!
What about liberal lion Bernie Sanders? I'd sure like an explanation for their vote.
It makes me wonder if when they promised to “end No Child Left Behind,” did they mean the policies in the bill or just the name!?
The Democrats seem to be committed to the notion that the only way to tell if a school is doing a good job is by reference to its test scores. High test scores – good school. Bad test scores – bad school.
This is baloney! Test scores show parental income, not academic achievement. Virtually every school with low test scores serves a majority of poor children. Virtually every school with high test scores serves rich kids.
Real school accountability would be something more akin to the original vision of the ESEA – making sure each district had what it needs to give kids the best education possible. This means at least equalizing funding to poverty schools so they have the same resources as wealthy ones. Even better would be ending our strange reliance on local property taxes to provide the majority of district monies.
But the Dems won't hear it. The Murphy Amendment seems to show that they're committed to punishing poor schools and rewarding rich ones.
I really hope I'm wrong about this. Please, anyone out there, talk me down!
Up until now I've always been with the Democrats because they had better – though still bad – education policies than the Republicans. I'm not sure I can say that anymore. In fact, it may be just the opposite.
Which party is most committed to ending Common Core? The Republicans!
Which party has championed reducing federal power over our schools and giving us a fighting chance at real education reforms? Republicans!
Which party more often champion's parental rights over the state? Republicans!
Sure, most of them still love vouchers and charter schools. But increasingly so do the Democrats.
This vote has me rethinking everything.
Our country's education voters may have just been abandoned by their longest ally.
Where do we go from here?

A new, internal Conservative Party poll is rumoured to show the Tory candidate on just 22 percent in the crucial by-election constituency of Clacton, following the defection of the now UKIP member Douglas Carswell.
Carswell defected in the last days of August, resigning their seat and triggering a by-election to allow the people of Clacton to decide whether they wanted them back as a UKIP Member of Parliament, or whether they wanted the next Conservative candidate in line to take their place.
A poll form early September showed UKIP on 64 percent, with the Tories on just 20 percent. But subsequent polls have been slightly more encouraging for the Tories, with one showing the party on 24 points.
However, Conservative Party insiders have told Breitbart London that another recent poll shows the Conservative candidate Giles Watling on the decline again, leaving the party of 22 percent.
Breitbart London asked the Conservative Party's press office to release the poll or make a statement on the matter, to which the response was: “No Comment”.
UKIP MEP Steven Woolfe told Breitbart London: “Camerons birthday on the 9th October makes him, like me a Libran. Unfortunately, they will not be able to celebrate fortune from their star signs balancing scales, as recent polling is weighing heavily in favour of Carswell becoming a UKIP MP.” Perhaps they wished they were a Sagittariun so they could sting UKIP into submission.
The poll is likely to show UKIP in the lead by around 35-40 points, showing no signs of improvement for David Cameron's party – the party will now be in damage limitation mode for the vote on October 9th, which also happens to be the Conservative Prime Minister's birthday.
Last week, I reported on a set of studies that suggest that 12-to-14-month-old infants have difficulty representing the number four. They're cool with one, fine with two and three, but should you place four objects in a box, the babies seem to have no clue how many objects they'll find in that box. Adults, as I mentioned, can successfully track four or five. But for all numbers, high and low, we have another trick up our sleeve—counting. It's worth asking then (as some commenters did) just how adults might represent exact numbers if we couldn't count.
Take Pirahã, the language of a tribe of hunter-gatherers living in small Amazonian villages. Pirahã is a quirky tongue all around, but here we'll focus only on its treatment of number. For starters, number is not marked morphologically as it is in many other languages (e.g., there is no distinction between pot and pots depending on the number of objects in question). But more strikingly, according to research published in 2008 by Michael Frank, now at Stanford, and their collaborators—including linguist Daniel Everett, the subject of a fascinating New Yorker profile that focuses on their work with the tribe—the language has no exact number terms. None.
In one study, six members of the Pirahã tribe watched as 10 spools of thread were displayed, one at a time. After each spool was laid down, participants were instructed (by Everett, who speaks the language) to label the number of spools currently displayed. In doing so, participants used three terms: one was used for a “single” spool, one roughly corresponded to “two-or-three” spools, and the last was used to indicate the rest of the spools, or “many.”
But then researchers asked participants to label the spools in descending order, beginning with 10 spools and going down to one. Here, the labeling looked considerably different: nine and 10 were still labeled as “many,” now but eight, seven, and six were given the label that had previously corresponded to “two-or-three.” And all numbers under six were fair game for the label that had earlier indicated “one.” Thus, it seems that all number terms in Pirahã are relative. Rather than meaning “one”, “two” and “many,” they, like “small,” “medium,” and “large,” can have very different meanings depending on whether they're used to describing growing piles of objects or shrinking ones.
But are exact number terms necessary for understanding fundamental concepts related to counting, such as one-to-one mapping? In a second experiment, 14 members of the Pirahã tribe (the better part of an entire village) participated in a series of tasks designed to test just this. In some tasks, one-to-one mappings could be made visually, as when an experimenter lined up between four and 10 spools of thread on a table, and participants were asked to line up an equivalent number of objects in parallel. But other tasks—like the “nuts-in-a-can” task, which went down exactly as its name suggests—forced participants to make one-to-one mappings between objects in front of them and objects they could only represent in memory. The participants largely succeeded when mappings could be made visually, but failed when they could not be, suggesting that Pirahã speakers do possess the concept of one-to-one exactness, just not—for larger quantities at least—the linguistic resources required for purely mental mappings.
And neither do Americans, once we've been stripped of our ability to count. In further work, a group of Bostonians was led through the same cluster of one-to-one mapping tasks while simultaneously “verbally shadowing,” or repeating aloud words from a speech stream. With their linguistic system otherwise occupied, these English speakers couldn't access exact number terms, and like the speakers of Pirahã, they were left guessing at nuts in a can.
US President Donald Trump has invited Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas for a visit to the White House, in the first phone call between the two leaders since Trump's inauguration on January 20.
Trump invited Abbas “to visit the White House soon to discuss ways to resume the [Palestinian-Israeli] political process”, Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, quoted Abbas' spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeina as saying on Friday.
The White House said in a statement that Trump invited Abbas to a meeting at the White House “in the near future”.
Abbas told Trump that peace was a “strategic choice” for the Palestinian people which should lead to the “establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel,” Wafa reported.
The White House said Trump told Abbas that they believe a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians must be negotiated directly by the both sides.
“The president emphasised their personal belief that peace is possible and that the time has come to make a deal,” according to a White House statement.

The Legislative Council of New Zealand existed from 1841 until 1951.[1] When New Zealand became a colony in 1841 the Legislative Council was established as the country's first legislature; it was reconstituted as the upper house of a bicameral legislature when New Zealand became self-governing in 1852.
Unlike the elected lower house, the House of Representatives, the Legislative Council was wholly appointed by the Governor-General. The New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 had authorised the appointment of a minimum of ten councillors. Beginning in the 1890s, the membership of the upper house became controlled by government of the day. As a result, the Legislative Council possessed little influence. While intended as a revising chamber, in practice, debates and votes typically simply replicated those in the lower house. It was abolished by an Act of Parliament in 1950, with its last sitting in December 1950.
Establishment [ edit ]
The Legislative Council was established by the Charter for Erecting the Colony of New Zealand on 16 November 1840, which created New Zealand as a Crown colony separate from New South Wales on 1 July 1841. Originally, the Legislative Council consisted of the Governor, Colonial Secretary and Colonial Treasurer. The Legislative Council had the power to issue Ordinances, statutory instruments.[3]
With the passing of the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, the Legislative Council became the upper house of the General Assembly in 1853.
Role [ edit ]
The Legislative Council was intended to act as a revising chamber, scrutinising and amending bills which had been passed by the House of Representatives. It could not initiate bills, and was prohibited from amending money bills (legislation relating to finance and expenditure). The model for the Legislative Council's role was the House of Lords in the United Kingdom.
Membership [ edit ]
Appointment and tenure [ edit ]
The New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 provided for councillors to be appointed for life terms by the Governor. As the power of the Governor over New Zealand politics gradually decreased, it became the convention that appointments were made on the recommendation of the Premier (later Prime Minister), essentially meaning that councillors were selected by the government of the day.
However, the life term of councillors meant that the Legislative Council always lagged behind the House of Representatives—Premiers were frequently hampered in their activities by a Legislative Council appointed by their predecessors. In 1891, life membership was replaced by a seven-year term by the new Liberal Party government of John Ballance. Part of the Liberal Party's motivation was probably ideological, but part was undoubtedly political, as Ballance's conservative predecessor, Harry Atkinson, had stacked the council with seven conservatives shortly before leaving office. Ballance had considerable difficulty in achieving their reform of the Council, with major clashes occurring between them and the Governor, The Earl of Onslow, who had approved the seven appointments. Ballance's victory is seen as establishing an important precedent in the relationship between Governor and Prime Minister. The seven appointments on 20 or 22 January to the Council were Atkinson themselves (he was appointed Speaker) plus Charles Bowen, James Fulton, Charles John Johnston, John Davies Ormond, William Downie Stewart, Sr. and John Blair Whyte.
The structure of the Legislative Council prior to 1891 was therefore similar to that of the Canadian Senate (which continues as an appointed upper house, although senators are no longer appointed to life terms, and must retire at the age of 75).
The title "The Honourable" could be retained from 1894 by a councillor with not less than ten years service if recommended by the Governor. This privilege was extended to one member, William Montgomery, in 1906; and a further eleven members in 1951 after abolition of the Council.
Number of members [ edit ]
It was specified in the Constitution Act 1852 that the Council would consist of at least ten members. Although not actually a part of the Act, instructions were issued that the number of members should not exceed fifteen. One member was to be selected as Speaker of the Legislative Council, corresponding roughly to the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives. A quorum of five members was established.
The first appointments to the Legislative Council were made in 1853, when twelve members were called to the upper house. They were John Salmon, William Swainson and Frederick Whitaker on 26 May 1853; Mathew Richmond on 23 June 1853; and on 31 December 1853 Edmund Bellairs, George Cutfield, William Kenny, John Yeeden Lloyd, Ralph Richardson, Henry Seymour, Henry St. Hill and John Charles Watts-Russell.[7] Gradually, the maximum number of members was raised, and the limit was eventually abolished. The Council reached a peak of 53 members in 1885 and 1950.
Extent of representation [ edit ]
The Legislative Council was generally less representative of the New Zealand public than was the House of Representatives. Women were not eligible to serve as councillors until 1941, and only five were appointed. Two, Mary Anderson and Mary Dreaver, were appointed in 1946 by the First Labour Government. In 1950 when the First National Government appointed the suicide squad to vote the council out of existence three women were included; Cora Louisa Burrell, Ethel Marion Gould and Agnes Louisa Weston. Māori were slightly better represented. The first two Māori councillors were appointed in 1872, not long after the creation of the Māori electorates in the House; Mokena Kohere and Wiremu Tako Ngatata. A convention was established that there should always be Māori representation on the Council.
1891 appointments [ edit ]
In January 1891 the outgoing Atkinson Ministry appointed six new members to the Legislative Council, with the object of blocking any radical bills that the John Ballance (who became Premier on 24 January) and the new Liberal Government might introduce. . They were the last appointments for life as the new government introduced a seven year term. The new members were Charles John Johnston and John Davies Ormond on 20 January; and Harry Atkinson, James Fulton, William Downie Stewart, and John Blair Whyte on 22 January. John Hall had written to Ormond: “It will be a serious disaster if the Council is not strengthened before the Reds get into the saddle.”
Petitions were tabled against the "stacking" of the Council" by MPs and by Aucklanders.[11] But the "stacking" has been seen as assisting the Liberal Government which: might not have survived but for this assistance .... (which) provided a useful unifying influence in the critical early years (and) identified with dramatic clarity the reactionary class enemy .... and acted as a convenient brake on the radicals (who) were asked to settle for moderate measures.
Proposals for election [ edit ]
A number of proposals were made that the Legislative Council should be elected, not appointed. When responsible government had been granted at the beginning of the 2nd Parliament, the Governor, Thomas Gore Browne, was given sufficient authority to make the Legislative Council elected, but no action was taken. In 1914, a reform proposal to establish a 42 or 43 member councils elected by proportional representation for six years was introduced by the Liberals, but postponed due to World War I. In 1920 it was no longer favoured by the Reform government then in power. But the 1914 Act "remained like a sword of Damocles suspended above the nominated upper house, available at will or whim to any succeeding government".
Abolition [ edit ]
External image Final gathering of the Legislative Council, 1 December 1950: [1]
By the middle of the 20th century, the Legislative Council was increasingly being looked on as ineffectual and making little difference to the legislative process. The Legislative Council rarely criticised bills sent to it by the House, and many believed that it was now obsolete. Some favoured its reform, while others favoured its abolition; among the latter group was the leader of the National Party, Sidney Holland, who introduced a private member's bill to abolish it in August 1947.[1]
However, because the Parliament of New Zealand was unable to amend the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 (because it was an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament, and the New Zealand Parliament was barred from amending the parts of the Act dealing with the establishment of the Legislative Council) it had to first adopt the Statute of Westminster 1931, which it did with the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947. } Following the adoption of the Act, the Parliament of New Zealand passed the New Zealand Constitution Amendment (Request and Consent) Act 1947, and the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the New Zealand Constitution Amendment Act 1947, allowing the New Zealand Parliament to amend the Constitution Act and abolish the Legislative Council. However, the Labour government did not actually enact the abolition itself, and lost office in the 1949 general election.
In 1950, the National Party, now in government, passed the Legislative Council Abolition Act. To assist its passage into law, Holland appointed twenty members known as the "suicide squad", to vote for abolition, just as the Australian state of Queensland had done to abolish its upper house in 1922. They included former MPs Harold Dickie and Garnet Mackley.[1]
To encourage co-operation from other members, Holland also promised to use the money saved through abolition to set up a fund for retired members. A Statutes Revision Committee (now defunct) was established to carry out some of the scrutiny that the Legislative Council had been intended for. Although abolition was intended as an interim measure, no serious attempts were made to introduce a new second chamber, and Parliament has been unicameral since.[15]
Proposed reestablishment [ edit ]
Support for bicameralism is not completely absent, and there have been occasional proposals for a new upper house or Senate.[15] A constitutional reform committee chaired by Ronald Algie proposed an appointed Senate in 1952. In 1990, the government of Jim Bolger proposed an elected Senate, an idea advanced partly as an alternative to New Zealand's electoral reform process.[17]
Unicameralists in New Zealand, like former Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Palmer, argued that the country is a small and relatively homogeneous unitary state, and hence does not need the same arrangements as federal countries like Australia or Canada.[18][19] In addition, Peter Dunne, then also a Labour MP, argued that other political reforms in New Zealand such as the strengthening of the select committee system, and the introduction of proportional representation, provided adequate checks and balances, which would simply be duplicated by a second chamber.[20]
Legislative Council Chamber [ edit ]
External image Legislative Council Chamber today: [2]
Today, the Legislative Council Chamber is used for the speech from the throne, as following the British tradition, the Sovereign may not enter the elected House. The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod summons the House of Representatives to attend the State Opening of Parliament in the Legislative Council Chamber, where the Speech is read usually by the Governor-General. It is also used for some select committee meetings, as well as meetings of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and other official functions

John and John are back again.
The Vancouver Canucks and Sportsnet released their broadcast schedule on Wednesday, and once again the local TV broadcast will be called by John Shorthouse and John Garrett. This is Shorthouse's 20th season in the Jim Robson Broadcast Gondola, having called games since the debut of the orca in 1997.
All 82 regular season games, plus seven out of eight preseason games, will be televised this year.
That includes the Canucks' trip to China, with preseason games in Shanghai (September 21) and Beijing (September 23). The Canucks and Kings will charter a plane from Los Angeles to Shanghai after a game at Staples Center on September 16.
The Canucks will air nationally 36 times this season, including 15 appearances on Hockey Night in Canada. That's well back of the Toronto Maple Leafs (23) and Montreal Canadiens (22), that air on HNIC nearly every week. The Senators (17), Oilers (15), Flames (13), and Jets (13) are in the same ballpark as Vancouver.
Hockey Day in Canada runs on January 20, with all seven Canadian teams in action, including the Canucks playing in Edmonton.
The Canucks can be found regionally on Sportsnet Pacific 42 times this season, as well as Sportsnet Vancouver Hockey (the Sportsnet ONE companion channel) four times.
All Canucks games will also air on Sportsnet 650, the new all-sports radio station that launches in Vancouver next week. Brendan Batchelor and Corey Hirsch, as previously announced, are 650's new radio duo for Canucks games.
Shorthouse will no longer broadcast games on radio, a source tells Daily Hive, as 650 runs exclusively with Batchelor as their play-by-play man. That's a departure from Shorthouse's role with TSN 1040, where they would call games on radio whenever they aren't tied up with their television duties.
Shorthouse calls every regional Canucks game on television, and has been added to a few national games recently as well. That doesn't leave many games left for radio anyway, although they likely won't get many playoff games on television (beyond the first round anyway) when and if the Canucks return to the postseason.
Perhaps this free time will make Shorthouse available for non-Canucks broadcasts on Sportsnet, which could boost their profile outside of the Vancouver market.
Until then, expect to hear Shorthouse on television during most Canucks games, and on Sportsnet 650 as a guest during their weekday programming.
Joey Kenward has also joined on with Sportsnet 650, and will host the station's pre-game and post-game shows. News 1130's Ann Smaltz will work as a rinkside reporter for radio broadcasts.

Leaks, threats and insults. And it lasted less than two weeks. Here's a look back at the very short tenure of the former White House communications director, Anthony Scaramucci. (Victoria Walker,Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)
How zany was Anthony Scaramucci's 10-day turn as White House communications director? Their feud with Reince Priebus escalated to Shakespearean proportions — then turned out to involve an email prankster posing as President Trump's ousted chief of staff.
On top of everything else, Scaramucci got punked.
CNN's Jake Tapper reported Monday night on a heated email exchange that occurred on Saturday, the day after Trump replaced Priebus with John F. Kelly and three days after a bizarre episode in which Scaramucci on Twitter appeared to accuse Priebus of leaking a document that is actually a public record. Here's an excerpt of Tapper's report:
Masquerading as Priebus, the prankster emailed Scaramucci's official account using a mail.com account on Saturday, the day after Priebus' resignation was announced. “I had promised myself I would leave my hands mud free,” wrote the fake Priebus, “but after reading your tweet today which stated how; 'soon we will learn who in the media who has class, and who hasn't', has pushed me to this. That tweet was breathtakingly hypocritical, even for you. At no stage have you acted in a way that's even remotely classy, yet you believe that's the standard by which everyone should behave towards you? General Kelly will do a fine job. I'll even admit they will do a better job than me. But the way in which that transition has come about has been diabolical. And hurtful. I don't expect a reply.” The very real Scaramucci responded: “You know what you did. We all do. Even today. But rest assured we were prepared. A Man would apologize.” Fake Priebus wrote back: “I can't believe you are questioning my ethics! The so called 'Mooch', who can't even manage their first week in the White House without leaving upset in their wake. I have nothing to apologize for.” Actual Scaramucci responded: “Read Shakespeare. Particularly Othello. You are right there. My family is fine by the way and will thrive. I know what you did. No more replies from me.”

The same prankster also fooled homeland security adviser Tom Bossert, Eric Trump and Jon Huntsman Jr., the president's nominee to serve as ambassador to Russia, by posing as other officials.
White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders told CNN that “we take all cyber-related issues very seriously and are looking into these incidents further.”
Tapper reported that “the prankster appears motivated by mischief, not anything more malignant, so the severity of these White House pranks should not be overstated.” But it is hard to overstate the irony of Scaramucci's hoodwinking.
They swept into the White House on a mission to plug leaks — like anonymously sourced reports that they and Priebus don't get along — yet their brief tenure was defined by spilling information into the public domain on Twitter and TV, in a raving phone call to a New Yorker reporter and, finally, in an email to Priebus's digital decoy.
STG Presents Live Wire! with Luke Burbank featuring Maria Semple, Misha Collins and Telekinesis at The Neptune on December 9, 2016.
Join Emmy award-winning host Luke Burbank for the taping of LiveWire, the fastest growing entertainment show on public radio. Get turned on to new music, comedy and conversations with a diverse range of original voices — and an anything-can-happen-vibe.
MARIA SEMPLE
Maria Semple is a titan. This is to say that she's an all-too rare author of literary fiction that is funny. Them most recent novel, Where'd You Go, Bernadette, tracks everything from the corporate culture of Microsoft to the preferred drinks of Antarctic researchers. She's also the author of “compassionate and wickedly funny satire," This One is Mine. Not impressed with those chops? She's also busted their chops as an Emmy nominated TV writer for shows such as Ellen, Mad About You and was a consulting producer on Arrested Development. They the latest book is titled Today Will Be Different, and will debut in October. They don't waste their time-- they go for the gut; source of feelings, source of belly-laughs.
MISHA COLLINS
Misha Collins isn't an angel, but they play one on TV. With a starring role on the CW's Supernatural as the angel Castiel, you may wonder if all that goodness and divinity leave their mark on them personally-- after all, word has it that their character's season 12 plot arc is largely focused around literally hunting down Lucifer. One response to that query is that Collins is the co-founder and board president of the “Random Acts of Kindness,” an organization “dedicated to funding and inspiring acts of kindness around the world.” He's also responsible for g.i.s.h.w.h.e.s, which stands for the Greatest International Scavenger Hunt the World Has Ever Seen-- a 7-time Guinness World Record breaking, insane scavenger hunt hosted by Collins that tens of thousand of people compete in every year from around the world. So, the short answer is maybe. For the long answer, you'll have to come see the show!
GYASI ROSS
Author, attorney, and podcaster Gyasi Ross is a member of the Blackfeet Nation and their family also comes from the Suquamish Nation. Remember their name: they have killed it every time he's been a guest on MSNBC, ESPN, Democracy Now, and radio shows nationwide; he's also a writer for the Huffington Post, Indian Country Today, Deadspin and Gawker. Ross has been making a name for themselves as a thinker and commentator on issues of race, Native rights, white privilege, and social justice. Oh right, and they also rap. This fall, Ross began recording a weekly podcast-- Break Dances with Wolves: Indigenous Pirate Radio, to discuss everything on their mind-- which these days, is a lot.
TELEKINESIS Seattle band Telekinesis is having a moment. That's to say, that after many moments of success and celebration in the indie power pop world, with albums Telekinesis!, 12 Desperate Straight Lines, and Dormarion, the band is having a moment of change, and growth, and yeah, more success. Their fourth studio album (studio in this case meaning the self-made recording space Telekinesis' Michael Lerner fashioned in their basement) Ad Infinitum is a dreamy new take on ‘80's style synths and drum machines, a lushly crafted vista of sound that doesn't resemble this decade, but doesn't really sound like any other, either.
HOST LUKE BURBANK
Luke Burbank grew up one of seven kids, learning early on how to vie for attention. Those profound childhood issues have propelled them to various media projects including This American Life, Wait Wait Don't Tell Me, CBS Sunday Morning, and the daily podcast Too Beautiful To Live. They live in Seattle with their wife and daughter. Luke is thrilled to be hosting Live Wire and keeps telling themselves you're chanting Luuuuuuuuuke and not saying Booooooooo because you're not doing that right? Wait, seriously, you were booing? At a public radio show? This would never happen to Ira Glass.

Team & Technology
It started with a frustration we all have — a dead smartphone at the worst time.
AMPY's co-founders -- Tejas Shastry, Alex Smith, and Mike Geier -- met in an entrepreneurship class at Northwestern University during their engineering PhDs. As active urbanites, they wanted to capture the energy from our daily activities to charge their phones. They engineered a solution to do just that, creating the technology that powers AMPY (formerly known as myPowr).
We see the technology behind AMPY being integrated directly into smartwatches, fitness trackers, and other devices yet to be invented, so you never have to plug them in.
Traditional kinetic chargers capable of the same amount of energy generation as AMPY would need to be three times the size and weight.
At the heart of AMPY are our proprietary inductors that transform your kinetic energy into usable power.
We designed AMPY to be small and lightweight. Our patent-pending and proprietary inductor technology enables the device to generate significant power while remaining compact so it fits into your life.
Bringing human power to life
We have packed AMPY with lab-tested technology over the past year.
Our team of engineers and designers crafted dozens of generations of prototypes before we got it right, including hours of product testing, hundreds of customer interactions, and dozens of 3D-printed models.
Our product is validated and has won numerous awards, including the Clean Energy Trust Consumer Favorite Prize, the 1776 Global Challenge Cup Crowd Favorite, and the Energy Prize at the Northwestern University Venture Challenge.

Perks and Stretch Goals
Our perks feature the following configurations:
Hillary Clinton has almost caught up with Donald Trump in campaign coverage on television and online, reducing a clear advantage Trump had against their opponents during the Republican primaries.
In July, Clinton got $513 million worth of U.S. media, just $20 million less than Trump, according to mediaQuant, a Portland, Oregon, firm that analyzes television, print and online media and social media — but not Facebook — for the quantity and quality of mentions of candidates.
“He's kind of topped out,” said Paul Senatori, chief analytics officer at mediaQuant, about Trump.
The exact magnitude of these numbers — which, very roughly speaking, approximate how many candidates would be willing to spend if they had to buy the media coverage and online discussion they get for free — is both heavily disputed (more on that later) and not particularly important. What matters is how the value of one candidate's coverage compares to another's, and those figures show clearly that Clinton has rapidly caught up to Trump.
MediaQuant, which also quantifies media mentions for business brands, said in March that Trump had gotten nearly $2 billion in free media, a figure that was cited widely — including on this website — and called “the killer statistic of the season” by Jim Rutenberg in The New York Times this week. By now, though, that killer stat is months out of date. Trump had gotten $4.3 billion in free media in the 12 months through July, according to data provided by mediaQuant — nearly twice Clinton's total.
But all those media mentions are now baked into the poll numbers, which sharply favor Clinton. What matters for the candidates is how they're covered from now on, to complement the ads they and their supporting PACs can afford to buy. During the primaries, Trump held the reins of media coverage with a series of provocative comments, but they may find it harder to repeat that feat when facing just one opponent who is well-known and polarizing.
These figures should be viewed skeptically for several reasons, some of which Senatori brought up themselves in a telephone interview. For one thing, mediaQuant is limited by the data it can access easily. Facebook, which represents a large share of public online media consumption, isn't counted. Also, unlike analyses of more limited segments of media, it's not practical to hand-code every blog post or online forum, so mediaQuant relies on automated tagging. Every article that mentions a candidate in the headline, the lead paragraph or at least twice in the body text counts.
And while the company's software tries to detect sentiment, that's notoriously difficult for machines (and not so easy for people). The company takes a conservative approach to the problem, Senatori said, treating most coverage as neutral and weighting the value of the most positive coverage only about three times as heavily as the value of the most negative coverage. As the century-old saying goes, “there is no such thing as bad publicity.” Senatori also pointed out that what a journalist might consider bad publicity for a candidate might not play that way to someone considering supporting them or them
Converting media mentions to a monetary value also requires some heroic assumptions and is controversial among people who work in media. MediaQuant doesn't assume a candidate would pay as much for an article that mentions them as they would for an ad of the same size running alongside it. The most any mention is worth is 44 percent of what it would cost to place an equivalent ad. Free media has pluses and minuses. “You don't control it as much,” Senatori said, but “it has more credibility.”
Several media researchers expressed skepticism about mediaQuant's methods because of the inherent limitations. Dan Cassino, a political scientist at Fairleigh Dickinson University who wrote a book about Fox News, said they think mediaQuant's methods to evaluate coverage would make more sense for companies than for candidates.
“It's a gimmick,” Cassino said. “A good gimmick, and one that will help them sell subscriptions to companies to track their media coverage. Ironically, they're using something that they're not really good at in order to sell something that they likely are doing pretty well.”
Senatori responded that what works for measuring brands should work for candidates: “I hate to say candidates are brands, but to a certain extent they are marketed as brands when it comes to an election.”

Charles “Fred” Cundiff received word Friday that President Barack Obama had cut short their life sentence. The 69-year-old logged onto their prison email and thanked Beth Curtis, who had stumbled upon their case years ago as they advocated for their brother, another senior citizen handed a life sentence long ago for nonviolent marijuana crimes.
In their email, Cundiff asked Curtis to convey their gratitude to two others who clamored for their freedom. The email system they were using costs inmates 5 cents per minute and, they told Curtis, “[I] don't have enough money to take care of all this.”
Cundiff has been behind bars since 1991 and will need to pinch nickels another year.
Their reprieve takes effect Dec. 18, 2016, a full year after their name last week made a list of 95 people getting out early thanks to presidential action.
The former construction and nursery worker's life sentence began in 1992 after they were busted attempting to buy marijuana. They were charged with conspiracy and, despite prior convictions for growing or possessing marijuana, chose to go to trial. Others took plea deals and got less time.
In the following two-and-a-half decades Cundiff got divorced, developed skin cancer, had a bone near their eye partially disintegrate from an infection and underwent back surgery. They now shuffle about using a walker.

Bureau of Prisons
It's not clear why Cundiff must wait a year before the commutation takes effect. Another man serving a federal life sentence for marijuana, William Dekle, 66, will get out in April after being named by the White House on Friday.
The Justice Department, which includes the Office of the Pardon Attorney, did not respond to a request for comment on how the effective dates were selected.
Curtis says they wish Cundiff would be released immediately but has trouble criticizing the delay. They say they primarily feel grateful and hopeful more commutations will come from Obama, particularly for marijuana offenders who they say are unlikely to benefit from pending sentencing reform legislation in Congress.
Curtis' brother John Knock, 68, was not on the list Friday, nor were several others whose profiles they seek to boost on LifeforPot.com, or Timothy Tyler, serving life for selling pot and LSD, whose sister gathered nearly a half million petition signatures for their freedom.
“When the alternative was dying chained to a hospital bed, it puts it in a little different context,” they say of the one-year delay for Cundiff. “If I didn't know there were so many [inmates] in that situation who weren't going to get out at all, I would probably protest the one-year wait.”
Curtis came across Cundiff's name while researching cases that they wanted to include in a 2012 group clemency request from elderly marijuana inmates serving life in prison. They almost aren't included in the group petition, which was rejected, but was added after one of the original five received a sentence reduction.
Nobody had been advocating for him, they say, and without an official list of nonviolent marijuana-infraction inmates they had to pore over legal records to find cases that met their strict criteria.
“You have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find them, because lots of them have robbery priors or cocaine priors and I wanted them to be strictly marijuana offenders with life without any priors that would muddy the water -- so that's how I found him,” they say.
It took a while to establish contact with Cundiff, Curtis says. They ultimately succeeded with the help of one of their friends from high school.
“He's very sick and now they have advocates because he's gotten publicity," they say. "But I think my priority would not be complaining about the fact that he's not getting out soon enough. You're asking for mercy, and if you complain you're complaining about the people you're asking a favor of. It's a Catch 22 and I've chosen my side, not to sully the people we have to depend on for mercy and compassion. It's hard to stay on that track, but it's where I've got to be."
Marijuana possession for any reason outside limited research remains a federal crime, but state-level reforms largely have been tolerated since the late 1990s, when California rolled out a state-legal medical marijuana market. The Obama administration since 2013 has allowed state and tribal government to regulate sales of recreational marijuana, despite the laws that gave an earlier generation life sentences remaining on the books.
As the march toward liberalizing marijuana laws continues, the ranks of so-called pot lifers are thinning, with reprieves also coming at the state level. In Missouri, Jeff Mizanskey was granted parole in August. They had been sentenced to life without parole after accompanying a pot dealer to a hotel room in 1993 where the other man bought less than 10 pounds of marijuana.
I remember hearing a friend argue that Christopher Nolan was a one-note director. They didn't say that there was anything wrong with the note they had played wonderfully for years, but Nolan seemed incapable of stepping out of their comfort zone. In my mind, a Nolan film is based on two core components: a darker more realistic film universe and an interest in asking the audience puzzling questions. This has stayed consistent across their career. Memento, one of their earlier films, asked if memories created meaning and poked at if satisfaction through revenge is legitimate. Their most recent film, Interstellar, probed at the concept of destiny and asked if human emotions play a part in our species' intergalactic survival. Across every film, Nolan always grounded the fictional universe in possibility. Inception's dream infiltration is depicted as an established practice, Interstellar is rooted in quantum physical theories, and even the Batman trilogy explains the eccentric villains' superpowers with scientific or psychological truths. Nolan's ability to make fantasies seem possible mixed well with their interest in asking bigger questions. Their films have created some of the best movie magic in the past decade. They could stick to their one-note because they were the only one playing it.
The problem with Dunkirk is it abandons what Nolan is good at. There's no spectacle in grounding a historical event in reality and there are no bigger questions asked to the audience. This vacancy isn't replaced with other ideas or skills, they're left void. Unsurprisingly, Dunkirk feels like an empty film. It has no real purpose or justification for its existence. It's easy to keep occupied with the action set pieces and convince yourself that good production equates to a good film, but the only question you're left with after the film is: Why did they want to make this?
Historical films can be great because they give context and connection to events from the past. Some things cannot be conveyed in textbooks or lectures. You can read all the source material there is about the Colosseum, but seeing gladiators fight inside of it is a completely different experience. The best historical films act as a type of virtual tourism. You're visiting a time in history that no longer exists. You get a glimpse of what it was like to be there and intermingle with the people who were part of the event. The best historical films take the dead relics of the past and bring them alive.
By this metric Dunkirk is an absolute failure. The empty husk of Dunkirk is embodied by the lifeless characters in the film. There are three different narratives followed: one on the ground, one at sea and one in the air, each are anchored by a specific character but none of them provide any meaningful connection to the audience. There are no personal stories shared, no character flaws, no character strengths, no consequence to any action and I don't even remember hearing any of the characters' names. Creating a distinction in soldiers who all wear the same thing and have military regulated haircuts can be difficult, but other World War 2 films achieved this through charismatic actors or notable traits and decisions. Dunkirk doesn't use either of these strategies. The characters have nothing to distinguish them and they don't do anything worth remembering. Nolan has hinted that their goal for the film was to focus on the events themselves but as it turns out, it's hard to care about people you know nothing about.
Not every movie has to be a character study, but Dunkirk offers nothing else to intrigue the audience. The personal stories are obviously not the focus, but the grand narrative is also ignored. A movie like The Big Short or All The President's Men can let the character development take a backseat because the plot is more interested in telling the grand narrative. What caused the 2008 housing crisis? What led to Nixon's resignation? Or in Dunkirk's case: What was it like to be part of the Dunkirk evacuation? But the film isn't interested in the greater context. There's no explanation for why the evacuation was important. Who orchestrated it? How did it get to that point? Why was it successful? I won't argue that Nolan was obligated to answer these specific questions, but without characters to latch onto — what is the point of the story?
It appears the point for Nolan was to practice crafting action set pieces and organizing large scale shoots. The best parts of Dunkirk are when the characters are faced with extreme peril. The sound design is exceptional and the editing effectively demonstrates the true horror of war. Enemy bombers swoop into scenes with loud engines getting louder until they nearly deafen the audience. Various scenes of scrambling soldiers clawing their way to safety show the chaos of survival. This is the biggest (and only) strength of the film and it's evident from the first minute of the film, but it gets tiresome.
The entire movie feels like a prolonged montage of action sequences without a rest. Early on in the film two characters decide to masquerade as medics to gain passage on a ship that's leaving. This scene starts with a fast-paced score in the background as they race to get aboard the ship but they're slowed down by crowds of soldiers and bomber attacks. It's a tense sequence, but I got the sense that it never actually ended. There are peaks and valleys in the drama but the entire film is dedicated to keeping you on edge. There's never a moment to pause and even when one of the three narratives have a quieter moment, these scenes are dizzyingly interwoven with other characters fighting for their life. Unfortunately for the film's pacing, tension works like any other emotion, if you feel it for too long it loses its meaning. Which is why despite being a two hour action sequence, Dunkirk is one of the more boring films I've seen lately.
Perhaps the greatest sin of Dunkirk is its complete failure to convey the historical importance of the Dunkirk evacuation. Before the film was released I tweeted about a clueless audience member who saw the Dunkirk trailer and was convinced the movie was about the Normandy invasion. I suppose I shouldn't judge that person too harshly, since not everyone knows about every battle and event in World War 2. But as the credits for Dunkirk rolled, I overheard another couple of adults in their late 20s discussing their confusion: “When did Dunkirk happen? Was it before Normandy? After Normandy? During Normandy?” They had no idea.
In actuality, the Dunkirk evacuation occurred in 1940 after the Battle for France (and four years before the Normandy invasion). The allies had decisively lost that battle. With Belgium, Luxemburg, the Netherlands and now France eliminated from the war, with the Soviet Union signing a non-aggression pact, Britain stood alone against Germany, Italy and soon to be Japan. To add to the problems — 400,000 soldiers of the British army were still in mainland Europe. With the English Channel stuffed with minefields and covered by German U-boat patrols and Luftwaffe bomber raids, the evacuation seemed impossible. But the British pulled it off. An accomplishment the Prime Minister Winston Churchill called a “miracle of deliverance.” You don't get any of that historical weight or significance by watching Dunkirk. You get a two hour movie of guys standing on a beach.
Dunkirk is the story of Christopher Nolan stepping outside their comfort zone to disappointing results. There are moments of Nolan's big-idea questions sprinkled throughout various scenes, but they never commits to them. It's as if they wanted to prove that they could do something different and dove into the deep end without using their established talents to help keep them afloat. The man may have a remarkable crew, access to quality talent, and can craft a meaningful set piece but without a bedrock of purpose to support itself Dunkirk flounders and inadvertently proves the criticism against its director.

Danny Cevallos is a CNN legal analyst, criminal defense attorney and partner at Cevallos & Wong , practicing in Pennsylvania and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Follow them on Twitter: @CevallosLaw . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.
(CNN) Recently, Nashville's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals . Believe it or not, Nashville prosecutors have offered this option four times in the past five years.
There has been public outrage at the notion that a defendant in America in 2015 would be offered a choice of sterilization as part of a plea deal.
Except, it happens all the time.
Some have claimed this practice "evokes a dark corner of American history" where the mentally ill or "deficient" were forced to undergo sterilization.
Yeah, that's true. We did that. And it was bad. Except this isn't quite that.
Danny Cevallos
Female sterilization is linked to the controversial "eugenics" movement, which advocated for the notion that the human race can be improved by selective breeding of people with superior genes.
There is even a 1927 Supreme Court case, Buck v. Bell , in which the justices ruled that a state statute permitting compulsory sterilization of the unfit and "imbeciles," "for the protection and health of the state," was constitutional. The opinion in the case is stunning, especially because the Supreme Court has never technically overruled it. But Buck v. Bell dealt with involuntary sterilization of people because of their mental disabilities, not because they were being punished for a crime.
You can hate sterilization, and the Tennessee case may have the creepy feel of the antiquated practice of eugenics, but it's not that. Present-day sterilization plea deals involve a voluntary choice of sterilization by persons accused of a crime, and for whom sterilization will be part of their punishment.
Others may argue that the Supreme Court has already spoken on the issue of compulsory sterilization as punishment, and struck it down. That's true too, sort of.
In Skinner v. Oklahoma , the Court struck down a law permitting compulsory sterilization of criminals as unconstitutional, but not because it was cruel and unusual. Instead, the law was struck down because the law was unequally applied for similar crimes.
So the question remains: Is sterilization as a punishment unconstitutional?
The Eighth Amendment provides: "Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted."
Practically, however, punishments are rarely deemed cruel and unusual by the judiciary. We have executed people with hangings and by firing squad . Sterilization has to be somewhere below that, right? Ultimately, however, the constitutionality of sterilization may be a red herring in this analysis, because it appears that even if a punishment vciolates the Constitution, it is permissible, if you willingly choose it.
Suppose arguendo (for argument's sake) that sterilization is judicially labeled a cruel and unusual punishment, violating the Eighth Amendment. This is where it gets interesting: It still might be an appropriate and constitutional part of a plea deal. Shocked? You shouldn't be.
As citizens, we validly waive our constitutional rights all the time. You waive your Fourth Amendment protections against search and seizure when you answer "yes" to an officer's "Mind if I look in your trunk?" You waive your Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when you try to explain to the detective in the interrogation room how that body got in your vehicle's trunk. So then, if we can validly waive our other constitutional rights, can we waive our Eighth Amendment rights and choose a cruel and unusual punishment, even if it would otherwise be unconstitutional? And are people outraged because this is a new step in punishment or a new frontier and a slippery slope in the world of plea deals?
Nope.
If sterilization plea deals are likely constitutional, and we've been doing it for a while, then that begs the question: Why the outrage now? Why the story that a Tennessee prosecutor was fired for a plea bargain that appears to be widely practiced?
There are really only two possibilities. First, some people just had no idea that this was going on until this story hit the news. Second, even if we knew about it, we didn't mind the practice until now because of one fundamental difference.
Most of the sterilization defendants are men.
Search your feelings, Luke . When we talk about castrating men who are recidivist sexual predators and child molesters, the idea of castration as punishment doesn't sound so bad right? Be honest: Let go of your "we're-all-equal-in-all-ways" banner for a moment. After all, not too long ago, execution was a legal punishment for nonhomicide sex crimes in some jurisdictions. So if we're OK with the gas chamber, we're probably OK with a snip. It's OK. You can admit it; we are all hardwired with a modicum of gender bias, whether we like it or not.
Still not convinced? Watch this parlor trick: What if I suggested sterilization for a person convicted of having sex with a minor? So far you're not ruling it out.
And what if it's a young female high school teacher having sex with their 17-year-old student ? Most of our gut feelings shifted from "maybe" to "no" just now. It's OK to admit that, too. Of course, sterilization won't prevent a female sex offender from offending again, no more than sterilization will prevent a male offender from offending again. But the point is, somehow, the notion of sterilizing a male criminal somehow sits better with us than sterilizing a female criminal.
Maybe it's that on a primal, unconscious level, what feels cruel and unusual punishment for a woman just feels less so for a man. Even if you're offended by this theory of why an old practice is now a "shocking" news story, you must concede it fits. Why else has castration of men not been a blip on the radar, but offering a woman the option of sterilization is suddenly a travesty? Of course, we have to consider the related justification. Overall, a lot more men commit acts that merit sterilization than do women. Just ask any domestic violence prosecutor.
Are sterilization plea deals morally right? It's hard to say. For now, they appear to be constitutional, but controversial. If we know a mother is likely to kill or seriously hurt their current children or their unborn child, should the government step in? If so, to what degree? Fortunately, we can avoid a final decision and continue to attack the problem in a way that seems to be more acceptable for now: just keep neutering the men.
Changes have been made to on-street parking in the newly reopened stretch of King Street in Uptown Waterloo.
On-street parking is no longer allowed along the northbound side of King Street between William Street and Willis Way, where the newly-installed Ion light rail track runs in that section of King Street.
"The reality is, wherever there is a track, you can not park a vehicle," said Patti Brooks, executive director of the Uptown Waterloo BIA.
"And that's whether or not the train is running."
The exception to that rule is for contractor vehicles; work is still underway on the overhead wiring – or catenary – system.
On Saturday, drivers were still adjusting to the change, with cars parked all along the stretch between William Street and Willis Way.
Free parking in 2 city lots
At the same time, two lots have been designated as temporary free parking spaces for the holiday season.
Until Jan. 2, 2017, motorists can park for free behind the old Post Office at Bridgeport and Regina streets, and across the street, in a second lot.
There is no set time limit for parking in those two lots but, as in other municipal lots, parking is not permitted overnight between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. unless the owner has registered the car with the city's Park It and Leave It program.

Gloria Tesch, if you're not familiar, is a self-published author. Them parents self-published their book at the age of 13 and since then they have repeatedly claimed to hold the title of “World's Youngest Published Novelist”, despite not being the youngest published author, and despite not actually being published.
Over time, they have become rather well-known for their ludicrously dishonest attempts at self-promotion, which include spamming numerous websites with their own information, sneaking into Barnes and Noble and taking pictures of themselves with their books that she'd placed on bestseller racks, and creating false book trailers with paid actors pretending to cosplay characters from their books.
They have supposedly turned down offers from major Hollywood heavyweights, have plans for a Maradonia Theme Park, and are currently in the process of turning the Maradonia “saga” into a movie, with funding from their parents' deep pockets and a failed IndieGogo fundraiser that made 7% of their goal.
Needless to say, hilarity has ensued.

While there are no suggestions that the Dallas shootings that targeted police leaving five officers dead and many more wounded have any ties to terror groups, jihadis online have wasted no time in lauding the attacks and calling on their supporters to carry out more violence.
In private forum messages seen by The Foreign Desk, both ISIS and Al Qaeda acknowledged the Dallas attacks and encouraged their audience to be inspired to do more.
In an Al Qaeda forum, a jihadi writes the attacks “by the grace of Allah 4 officers dead inshAllah” and says, “After all the mass murders the kuffars (blasphemers) have done in Muslim lands, pleasing to see them sniping each other.”
“We may think of using this ‘racism' topic as an opportunity to increase the division of the kuffar through propaganda and instigate more attacks on them!” they write.
They explicitly instruct followers to “make propaganda pictures and inspiring media works to instigate more black ppl (people) attacking the US govt.”

And a message from ISIS was posted on an account by the United Cyber Caliphate, a self-proclaimed “hacking” group linked with the Islamic State.
“Are all the ‘Black' Criminals? Or it's just #America is the Terrorist?” the group posted.
This particular media arm of the Islamic State in recent weeks published so-called ‘kill lists,' urging supporters to go after people mentioned on a list with names and addresses.
In keeping with its style of publishing ‘lists,' the group posted a purported list of Dallas police arrests, urging people to compare “the ratio of the ‘White vs Black& Latino,'” while a second list displays Dallas police salaries with the caption, “How America buys The consciences of the people?” by #Money ....” (How does America buy the consciences of the people? Answer: by money.)
Last month The Foreign Desk reported on an Al Qaeda affiliated online forum advising jihadis in the aftermath of the Orlando terror attack to target white Americans as opposed to minorities, to avoid having terror mislabeled as a hate crime.
In an attack that left 49 dead and more than 50 wounded, ISIS-linked terrorist Omar Mateen opened fire at a gay bar in Florida in June. In a 911 call Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, and subsequently, the Islamic State's AMAQ news later claimed responsibility.
WHY THIS MATTERS IN BRIEF DeepMind is trying to create a new Artificial General Intelligence architecture by creating an adaptable, massive neural network that draws on thousands of other “sub” neural networks.
On January 20th Google's DeepMind division, the division behind a myriad of artificial intelligence (AI) firsts, quietly submitted a paper on Arxiv entitled “PathNet: Evolution Channels Gradient Descent in Super Neural Networks” that mostly went unnoticed.
While the research shines a spotlight on the latest trend in deep learning research – the desire to merge Modular Deep Learning, Meta-Learning and Reinforcement Learning into a single solution that leads to the creation of even more capable deep learning systems – what makes this paper special is the fact that it's DeepMind's stab to become the first company to build the first, fabled, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) solution.
One day, it's said, AGI will be the basis of a new breed of machines whose overall intelligence rivals that of our own – that is to say it will be able to perform any intellectual task that humans can. It's fair to say that on its own that's an accomplishment, but then longer term there'll, again, be increased pressure on jobs which in an age of rising automation is already hitting the headlines on a daily basis.
Perhaps even more significantly though, many experts also believe that once we achieve AGI then Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) won't be far behind – and at that point we'll be the intellectual equivalent of, in Elon Musk's own words, “a pet cat,” to our new machine overlords. At the moment analysts, who've been wrong about almost everything else, from autonomous cars to virtual reality, yeah it's an analyst versus futurists thing, guess where I sit, think that the first AGI machine will appear in the mid 2030's but now that DeepMind have a plan we could see that date come down, possibly by five to ten years to the late 2020's.
“For artificial general intelligence (AGI) it would be efficient if multiple users trained the same giant neural network, permitting parameter reuse, without catastrophic forgetting. PathNet is a first step in this direction. It is a neural network algorithm that uses agents embedded in the neural network whose task is to discover which parts of the network to re-use for new tasks,” says the paper.
Catchy.
In short unlike more traditional monolithic deep learning networks, PathNet will rely on a network – a collection – of not just one neural network like many of today's systems do, but many and it will train them all to perform multiple tasks.
Putting it in more human terms this new AGI network will rely on, and draw on, the collective power of lots of skilled, specialised smaller neural networks, just as our own brains do, and combine them into what ostensibly will be the first AGI “brain.”
In the authors experiments, they have shown that a network trained on a second task learns faster than if the network was trained from scratch. The significance of this is that it shows that the new system is doing something called “transfer learning,” where previous knowledge is reused in new ways.
An example of PathNet transfer learning
The new PathNet model includes a mix of transfer learning, continual learning and multitask learning and it's thought that all of these are essential in order to create a more continuously adaptive network, which, again, it's thought will be necessary if we're to create an AGI.
PathNet consists of layers of neural networks where the interconnection between each network in a layer is discovered using different search methods, four networks per layer, at a time, and the paper describes two discovery algorithms, one based on a genetic, or “evolutionary” algorithm, and another one based on something called A3C reinforcement learning.
The authors inspiration for the new system apparently came from the “Outrageously Large Neural Networks” project from Google Brain, which is described as follows:
“Achieving greater than 1,000x improvements in [AI] model capacity with only minor losses in computational efficiency on modern GPU clusters. We introduce a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts layer (MoE), consisting of up to thousands of feed-forward sub-networks. A trainable gating network determines a sparse combination of these experts to use for each example. We apply the MoE to the tasks of language modelling and machine translation, where model capacity is critical for absorbing the vast quantities of knowledge available in the training corpora. We present model architectures in which a MoE with up to 137 billion parameters is applied convolutionally between stacked LSTM layers.”
The new PathNet architecture might also give others in the field a roadmap that should help them create more adaptable deep learning architectures, most of which today are rigid after training and rigid when deployed – unlike biological brains that are continuously learning. PathNet on the other hand now means that new neural networks could be taught new skills, while at the same time drawing on, and leveraging, other neural networks that have already had similar, or complimentary, types of training – allowing the whole system to learn much faster.
Furthermore, as these learning systems improve, and as they are capable of doing new things it's also likely that in the future they'll be able to use less computing power, and again that means that the whole cycle will accelerate as they draw on the skills of thousands, or maybe even millions, of “sub” neural networks at a time.
Either way, perhaps AGI just took a giant leap forwards.
The Greek government has initiated a debate over the legalization of cannabis for recreational purposes.
Deputy Minister for Agriculture Yiannis Tsironis, said that cannabis should be cultivated legally, “even on someone's balcony”, provided that the user pays a fee to the state.
Speaking on Greek TV, Tsironis, added that people should be allowed to grow a certain number of plants.
The minister; a member of the Green Party that joined SYRIZA in government, admitted that a bill on recreational cannabis is not yet ready.
They said that the drug problem in Greece needs to be tackled, and the only way for this to happen is to give users the opportunity to find drugs legally.
Last July, Greece became the latest European country to legalize cannabis for medical purposes.
Cannabis is normally prescribed for conditions such as muscle spasms, chronic pain, PTSD, epilepsy and cancer.

An element that exists or existed in Real Life but is assumed to be fictional by audiences, often because it seems too unlikely, bizarre, or kitschy to be real. Truth really is stranger than fiction...
The Trope Namer is A Charlie Brown Christmas, from 1965. In the special, Lucy said "Get the biggest aluminum tree you can find, Charlie Brown! Maybe painted pink!". Aluminum Christmas trees? In pink?! Modern-day viewers are frequently surprised to find out that line wasn't merely a bit of comic exaggeration about Christmas commercialization. The '60s had their share of oddball kitsch, and the aluminum Christmas tree is a God's-honest-truth real example — it was produced in many colors, including pink — though it was an artificial tree with metallic needles, not a modernistic hollow metal cone as depicted in the cartoon, and usually called a "tinsel tree".note You can buy them online .

So why do viewers of later generations assume aluminum Christmas trees must be fictional? Well, as it happened, A Charlie Brown Christmas caused the best-known inversion of The Red Stapler effect — it so thoroughly destroyed the appeal of this holiday decoration that sales plummeted like a rock, and the aluminum Christmas tree was taken off the market before the Sixties were over.note Artificial trees still exist, as any trip to a hardware or department store during December will tell you, but in the wake of Charlie Brown Christmas, great effort has since been made to make them as authentic-seeming as possible, and typically only the main "trunk" of the tree is made out of metal on modern examples — the bristles now tend to be synthetic fiber. In the last decade, though, the tinsel tree has made a phenomenal comeback.

In other words, this trope is in play when a quaint element of Real Life appears in a work of fiction and is mistaken for part of the fiction. The cause is always simple unfamiliarity with the object, so it is more likely to trip up an audience of people viewing that work from a different perspective, most commonly years after the work was released, or in another country. It doesn't hurt that other "aluminum Christmas trees" are, like the original, well outside the pale of usual experience and improbable by definition; even so, it's immensely funny (to people in the know) when an audience dismisses a Real Life element as patently absurd and "unrealistic".
This can also occur in a period work when the writers did do the research, but the truth they uncovered is so bizarre or surprising that audiences think they must have just made it up. In this case, they may add a "Not Making This Up" Disclaimer. Of course, something existing doesn't necessarily imply that it was common enough to just show up in the chronological and spatial span of the work or at the frequency it does in the work, which is why period pieces in which all the costumes are reconstructions or composites of documented outfits still manage to be fashionable for the period the works are written/produced in.
Compare Technology Marches On, "Seinfeld" Is Unfunny, Widget Series, Defictionalization, and Poe's Law. A subtrope of Reality Is Unrealistic, Values Dissonance, and Truth in Television. Can also be used as a means of Shown Their Work. Frequently found in Unintentional Period Pieces. If even the creators were unaware that the "tree" was real, it's Accidentally Correct Writing.
When this occurs in-universe, it's either Eskimos Aren't Real, or the work will give a "Not Making This Up" Disclaimer.

The Trojan War was long believed to have been pure myth until Heinrich Schliemann succeeded in finding the ruins of Troy in Hissarlik, Turkey. They still turned out to have grown in the telling somewhat, however. For one, there wasn't a single city of Troy, but many, each built over the ruins of the last. Which one of these, if any, inspired the story is hard to say. It wasn't just Troy either; Greek cities mentioned in the story but not inhabited in Homer's time have been found, and some of the stranger pieces of equipment like boar-tusk helmets have been found dating to the bronze age.
Archaeological discoveries apparently related to myths and legends tend to be all over the place with regards to this trope. Each new find has different groups declaring that a tale is confirmed, disproven, or needs to be rewritten and all can usually offer up at least a token bit of evidence for their viewpoint. Even the discoverers themselves are often at odds with each other over how to interpret what they've dug up. At least part of this problem derives from a sort of ancient Memetic Mutation. Good stories spread, and locals alter those stories to relate to local heroes, events, and locations. It's often a mistake to attempt to point to an archaeological site as the source of a story, because it's just as likely that there are literally dozens of such sites scattered around. For example, the famous Twelve Labors of Hercules were likely originally the famous acts of ten or twelve different local heroes, whose stories all got clumped up and attributed to the most famous one.

Members of the group - which seized Iraq's second city as part of its so-called Islamic State caliphate last summer - blew up a church which had been standing for thousands of years.
Conflicting reports have named the church as St Mary's and the 'Mother of Aid'.
Isis fighters inadvertently killed four children who were near the church at the time, Saeed Mamuzini, a spokesperson for the Mosul arm of the Kurdistant Deomcractic Party told the Rudaw Kurdish news website.
The incident is the latest example of Isis fighters destroying ancient artefacts and monuments which either predate Islam or are aligned with un-Islamic faiths and communities, in the year that it has seized swathes of Iraq and Syria.
In the past year, Isis has released propaganda videos of militants defacing monuments in the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud, northern Iraq before levelling the site with explosives; and using sledgehammers and Kalashnikovs to hack away at statues in the Iraqi city of Hatra.
Syria has also been targeted by the group, with the ancient city of Palmyra, the home to a set of ancient Roman ruins, falling in late May.
A brutal propaganda video recently released by the group shows the murder of 25 Syrian soldiers on the stage of a stunning Roman theatre once used for cultural performances.

This graphic shows a so-called photonic Mach cone, which is sort of like a sonic boom; but in this instance, you can see the cone-shaped wake of light pulses.
Just as aircraft flying at supersonic speeds create cone-shaped sonic booms, pulses of light can leave behind cone-shaped wakes of light. Now, a superfast camera has captured the first-ever video of these events.
The new technology used to make this discovery could one day allow scientists to help watch neurons fire and image live activity in the brain, researchers say. [Spooky! Top 10 Unexplained Phenomena]
Science behind the tech
When an object moves through air, it propels the air in front of it away, creating pressure waves that move at the speed of sound in all directions. If the object is moving at speeds equal to or greater than sound, it outruns those pressure waves. As a result, the pressure waves from these speeding objects pile up on top of each other to create shock waves known as sonic booms, which are akin to claps of thunder.
Sonic booms are confined to conical regions known as "Mach cones" that extend primarily to the rear of supersonic objects. Similar events include the V-shaped bow waves that a boat can generate when traveling faster than the waves it pushes out of its way move across the water.
Previous research suggested that light can generate conical wakes similar to sonic booms. Now, for the first time, scientists have imaged these elusive "photonic Mach cones."
Light travels at a speed of about 186,000 miles per second (300,000 kilometers per second) when moving through vacuum. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, nothing can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum. However, light can travel more slowly than its top speed — for instance, light moves through glass at speeds of about 60 percent of its maximum. Indeed, prior experiments have slowed light down more than a million-fold.
The fact that light can travel faster in one material than in another helped scientists to generate photonic Mach cones. First,study lead author Jinyang Liang, an optical engineer at Washington University in St. Louis, and their colleagues designed a narrow tunnel filled with dry ice fog. This tunnel was sandwiched between plates made of a mixture of silicone rubber and aluminum oxide powder.
Then, the researchers fired pulses of green laser light — each lasting only 7 picoseconds (trillionths of a second) — down the tunnel. These pulses could scatter off the specks of dry ice within the tunnel, generating light waves that could enter the surrounding plates.
The green light that the scientists used traveled faster inside the tunnel than it did in the plates. As such, as a laser pulse moved down the tunnel, it left a cone of slower-moving overlapping light waves behind it within the plates.
Using a "streak camera," scientists have imaged a cone-shaped wake of light called a photonic Mach cone for the first time. (Image: © Liang et al. Sci. Adv.2017;3:e1601814)
Streak camera
To capture video of these elusive light-scattering events, the researchers developed a "streak camera" that could capture images at speeds of 100 billion frames per second in a single exposure. This new camera captured three different views of the phenomenon: one that acquired a direct image of the scene, and two that recorded temporal information of the events so that the scientists could reconstruct what happened frame by frame. Essentially, they "put different bar codes on each individual image, so that even if during the data acquisition they are all mixed together, we can sort them out," Liang said in an interview.
There are other imaging systems that can capture ultrafast events, but these systems usually need to record hundreds or thousands of exposures of such phenomena before they can see them. In contrast, the new system can record ultrafast events with just a single exposure. This lends itself to recording complex, unpredictable events that may not repeat themselves in precisely the same manner each time they happen, as was the case with the photonic Mach cones that Liang and their colleagues recorded. In that case, the tiny specks that scattered light moved around randomly.
The researchers said their new technique could prove useful in recording ultrafast events in complex biomedical contexts such as living tissues or flowing blood. "Our camera is fast enough to watch neurons fire and image live traffic in the brain," Liang told Live Science. "We hope we can use our system to study neural networks to understand how the brain works."
The scientists detailed their findings online Jan. 20 in the journal Science Advances.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's political party, Likud, gave a statement on Sunday that said they repudiated their much-discussed 2009 speech that supported ending the Israel-Palestine conflict with a "two-state solution." Many have read this as Netanyahu dropping their support for an independent Palestinian state. Netanyahu faces difficult odds in the Israeli elections a little over a week away; they may be attempting to shore up their conservative base and fend off political challengers on their right. Later on Sunday, Netanyahu's office released its own statement disputing the accuracy of Likud's statement, insisting the prime minister "never said such a thing."
Three different statements about what Netanyahu believes
This all began on Friday, when the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth published what it said was documentation of a secret back-channel during the now-defunct 2013 US-led peace talks, in which Netanyahu's government proposed significant concessions toward the existence of a Palestinian state. The report put political pressure on Netanyahu, who may have appeared "soft" to voters on the right.
Then, on Saturday, Netanyahu's Likud Party published the first of what are now three contradictory statements on the prime minister's beliefs. This first statement was an election pamphlet announcing that Netanyahu had rejected their 2009 speech at Bar-Ilan University, in which they had first endorsed the idea of establishing a Palestinian state as part of a peace deal:
The Prime Minister announced that the Bar-Ilan speech is null and void. Netanyahu's entire political biography is a fight against the creation of a Palestinian state.
When this created an uproar, Likud at first walked it back, saying the pamphlet reflected the personal opinion of its author and not official policy.
But, as questions mounted, on Sunday Likud published a new statement — the second — that seemed to affirm the notion that Netanyahu now rejects the idea of a two-state solution, and thus the creation of a Palestinian state:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that [in light of] the situation that has arisen in the Middle East, any evacuated territory would fall into the hands of Islamic extremism and terror organizations supported by Iran. Therefore, there will be no concessions or withdrawals; they are simply irrelevant.
Later on Sunday, Netanyahu's personal office released the third statement of the weekend. This one announced that the two earlier statements were incorrect, and that Netanyahu had "never said such a thing."
The crucial bit of context here is that Israel is holding an election on March 17. While Netanyahu's coalition is still generally expected to do well enough for them to stay in their position as prime minister, that is not assured, and Netanyahu has been especially challenged by the right. Israel has substantial religious and secular right-wing movements, both of which tend to oppose the creation of an independent Palestinian state. Netanyahu's conservative political base is skeptical at best of striking a peace deal with Palestinians. This statement, in narrow political terms, may be Netanyahu's attempt to curb the challenge from their right and drive support among their base.
It's also worth noting that this coincides with a disintegration in relations between Netanyahu's government and the United States. Years of tension between Netanyahu and President Obama culminated in the Israeli leader's highly controversial speech to Congress just a few days earlier undermining Obama's efforts to reach a nuclear deal with Iran. The two-state deal is a major priority of the United States, and has been since before Obama, so Netanyahu may have felt more comfortable rejecting it now that relations are already so sour.
Skeptics have long doubted Netanyahu's true views on this
For as long as there has been an Israel-Palestine conflict, the most viable path to peace has typically been seen as the "two-state solution," in which both Israelis and Palestinians would have their own independent states. President George W. Bush made this a centerpiece of their 2002 peace plan.
The same year Benjamin Netanyahu become Israel's prime minister, in 2009 (he had previously held the office in the 1990s), they gave a speech at Bar-Ilan University endorsing the two-state deal, though tepidly and with significant caveats.
Netanyahu, a member of the conservative Likud Party, had never been a strong advocate for peace, so their speech was a seemingly historic moment. It also infuriated many to their political right.
Observers in both the US and Israel, though, soon began to wonder whether the speech was a sincere statement of Netanyahu's views and their government's policies. They did little to pursue this goal and has acted frequently contrary to it, for example by repeatedly expanding Israeli settlements in the West Bank, though it was clear to all observers — and repeatedly stressed by the United States — that this made peace far more difficult.
As the New Yorker's David Remnick wrote in 2013:
Netanyahu has done almost nothing to follow through on a two-state solution, and most Likud politicians today contend that they were deeply ambivalent about the speech, which caused a serious rift with their father and within the Party. They are convinced that they did it mainly to placate Barack Obama.
A lot has happened in the Israel-Palestine peace process between 2009 and today, and Netanyahu's critics as well as detractors have many data points they can point to in support of their various readings of their intentions and level of sincerity. The dueling statements this weekend have only further muddied the waters.
ALEPPO, Syria — Khaled was a theater student in Damascus prior to working as a disc jockey and then joining the rebel group Jaish al-Mujahideen.  They are now fighting in the ranks of the local al-Qaeda affiliate, Jabhat al-Nusra.
"Jaish [al-Mujahideen] wasn't strong enough. [Jabhat al-] Nusra is more powerful, and that's what we need right now," the 25-year-old in a brand-name jacket and glasses, camouflage trousers and black combat boots told Al-Monitor in the opposition-held part of Syria's former industrial capital and largest city.
The shaggy-haired man said that they had received training in Idlib from Jabhat al-Nusra about a year ago, and that they were now working as a tank commander in Aleppo province.
Jabhat al-Nusra's ideology is similar to that of the Islamic State (IS), but it has largely avoided the brutal tactics and repression of civilians the group it is fighting against in the Aleppo province is known for. Those in its ranks are believed to be mostly Syrians, in contrast with the high number of foreigners who have joined IS.
Many Jabhat al-Nusra fighters wear their hair long, "as the prophet did," but Khaled could easily be taken for any university student with "alternative" tendencies on the streets of many Western capitals.
Khaled's move to join Jabhat al-Nusra came after their father was imprisoned by the regime about 1½ years ago. Their father, a bus driver plying the route between Damascus and Aleppo, was found to have assisted a high-ranking officer in their defection to rebel forces. There has been no word of them since their arrest.
Late last year, the Syrian Network for Human Rights estimated that about 85,000 people were being held arbitrarily in regime prisons.
In early November, Jabhat al-Nusra attacked US-backed Harakat Hazm and the Syrian Revolutionary Front (SRF) in neighboring Idlib province on what has been deemed by most "an excuse," taking from them weaponry and establishing virtually unrivaled control of the area.
According to a commander of another group in the area that did not get involved in the fighting, Jabhat al-Nusra took at least nine tanks, several cars and pickup trucks, heavy machine guns, anti-aircraft guns, massive amounts of ammunition, TOW anti-tank missiles and bulldozers from Hazm's bases alone.
Some of that material has been shifted to Aleppo, as have some of the men.
Jabhat al-Nusra is stronger in some areas of the city than others, and has set up more checkpoints on the road from the Turkish border since Al-Monitor's last visit in late October. The area is nevertheless still mostly under the control of the more moderate Jabhat Shamiya, a group recently formed on the basis of the Islamic Front that fights alongside Jabhat al-Nusra on several fronts but is not officially aligned with it.
Two cars loaded with explosives blew up on Jan. 10 at one of Jabhat al-Nusra's checkpoints on the road to the border, killing a number of civilians and civil defense rescue workers who had rushed to the site following the first blast, as well as Jabhat al-Nusra fighters. A recent spat of car bombs in opposition areas has heightened concerns of infiltration by IS and others.
Khaled was part of Jabhat al-Nusra's offensive against the SRF and Harakat Hazm in Idlib before shifting to the Aleppo front. They had spent roughly eight months near Maarat al-Numan, until Jabhat al-Nusra gained supremacy among anti-regime groups in the region further to the west, and implied that the operation had long been under preparation, calling the moderate, nonideological SRF a "mafia."
"Maarouf collaborated with the regime," they said, referring to SRF leader Jamal Maarouf. "He must have. For two years the SRF didn't make any progress" at the two remaining military bases held by government troops in the region until Jabhat al-Nusra took them over.
After it had gotten the SRF and Harakat Hazm out of the way, Khaled said, "Jabhat al-Nusra finished Wadi Al-Deif and Al-Hamidiyeh off in 24 hours."
Rumors of collaborationist and conspiracy theories have long dominated discourse on and in the uprising against Syria's brutal, "mukhabarat-culture" police state.
A commander of a rival group told Al-Monitor that there was instead evidence of connections between the regime and Jabhat al-Nusra, as evinced by the rapid takeover of the bases and low fatalities. Syrian state-run television failed to mention the loss of the two bases it had fought hard for years to keep.
A member of Asala wa Tanmiyah, a faction that took part in the offensive alongside Jabhat al-Nusra and the Islamist Ahrar al-Sham, nevertheless called the rumor of collaboration of any sort of accord with the regime "absurd."
In recent days, Jabhat al-Nusra has been attacking the sole remaining regime-held, Shiite-majority villages of Nubl and Zahra north of Aleppo, fighting against large numbers of Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah fighters flanking regime troops.
On Jan. 10, Jabhat al-Nusra claimed responsibility for an attack across the border in Jabal Mohsen, an Alawite area in Tripoli, northern Lebanon, fueling concerns about further cross-border operations.
Whether or not many of its foot soldiers will leave Jabhat al-Nusra as soon as they have a valid alternative will depend in part on how long the conflict drags on, said a commander of a formerly important group that has lost men to more extremist, wealthier groups and "boats to Europe."
The general consensus among most Syrians Al-Monitor spoke to is that those in opposition areas have little choice but to see the al-Qaeda affiliate as its main bulwark against a power that has been killing and starving them for years, even if they reject its ideology.
Though protests have been held in Idlib against Jabhat al-Nusra, in Aleppo it has less of a perceived virtual monopoly on power and coexists somewhat warily alongside even Harakat Hazm, which it routed in Idlib. A commander from the latter taking Al-Monitor's reporter toward the Handarat front was easily waved through a Jabhat al-Nusra checkpoint in recent days.
So before I show the essay, I want to say a couple things. Firstly, I don't know what to call this, I think it could be an essay, so keep that in mind whilst reading. Secondly, allow this content to stand as an example of what this blog is going to become. If you have anything to say about it, do so. I am open for questions and whatever else the intertubes has in mind.
Enjoy
“I'm so meta even this acronym” Quoth Hofstadter, when asked to write a biography about himself. This 29 character self containing statement, could fit easily on to twitter. More and more, people are trying to figure out how to efficaciously use “characters” to express the most complex of human ideologies, such as an entire life.
The author of 1984, a novel encompassing dystopian life in a totalitarian government, once said that all language is leading to one word. By this compression, we lose sincerity, meaning, and passion. Language is what allows us to fully express ourselves, when language is constricted, no longer can we use vernacular as a form of expression. Instead ideas must flourish, the meaning behind a single word intensifies, and sentences are compact novellas. In our digital age when so much content is readily available, we as consumers, demand dense material that will use our time most effectively. If every second isn't filled with meaningful ideas, we can easily switch to something else that might be more effective.
One of the oppositions to this stance though, is the mere fact that language is expanded. Each year the Webster Dictionary is adding more and more words. Humans have access to more words in which to express themselves than ever before. Language evolves, that is the definition of language: a way life expresses ideas and emotions. It might not be that our language is getting compressed, but that ideas can be conveyed more readily through our expanding arsenal that is language.
Friedrich Nietzsche, in their essay “On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense,” discusses the derivation of language, stating that it comes not from truth, but from expression.
“We speak of a ‘snake': this designation touches only upon its ability to twist itself and could therefore also fit a worm. What arbitrary differentiations!”
All language speaks with relation to man. Through our perception, we have created a set of metaphors containing no inherent meaning. If language were based on the way things are, instead of the way things are interpreted, there would only be one language; but since expression is subjective, we can construct complex ideological conventions within the span of 140 characters.
One of the biggest pitfalls for anyone arguing a verbose approach to expression is ostensibly, the universal thought-terminating cliche, “I love you.” Think for a moment THE most complex of all human emotions, condensed into three words. Love can easily be extrapolated, there is so much more that you can say to a person, so many more ideas attached to these words; yet, it is all that needs to be said, and all is understood. “Life's unfair,” another thought terminating cliche, there are so many more reasons and ideas as to why bad things are happening, but it's all expressed through two words.
Language is powerful, it is the epitome of atavistic expressive mediums and it belongs to all of us. Language is personal, it is perception without truth, so go ahead, use words however you see fit. And, as the proverb goes: Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words, the smallest element of language possible of containing meaning in isolation, cannot produce the 4,000 newtons per square centimeter required to break my bones.
Almost everyone coming to Branson either knows or quickly finds out, that the “Baldknobbers” was Branson's first show, “the show that started it all.” Yet long before there was a Baldknobbers Jamboree or the city of Branson was incorporated on April 1, 1912, the “Bald Knobbers” had already become infused into the history and legend of the Ozarks and the area that has become one of the most popular family tourist destinations in America, Branson, Missouri.
As often happens, something good ended up going horribly wrong. In 1883 a group of men, led by Nathaniel Kinney formed a group to protect Taney County citizens against the actions of the “outlaws” who had come into the area. They got their name, “Bald Knobbers” because they met on the bald area on top of one of the areas mountains and were known for the distinctive masks they wore. They accomplished their initial objective and as a result, gained a lot of, what these days we call “political power”. Unfortunately, along with that power, they became a law unto themselves even to the point where Kinney shot one of the “anti-Bald Knobber” leaders in “cold blood” and it was deemed “self-defense.”
Their vigilante tactics lost them public support and the original Taney County Bald Knobbers were dissolved under the supervision of the Missouri Governor's office. Ironically, even though the Bald Knobbers they started had been disbanded, Kinney themselves was assassinated by an assassin hired by an “anti Bald Knobber” group and their assassin was acquitted on the grounds of self-defense.
All this might have been a little noted spot in history, but for Harold Bell Wright's landmark novel “Shepherd of the Hills” which was published in 1907 and featured the Bald Knobbers as the villains. It could be said that book and the tourists it brought to the Branson area to see the areas mentioned in the book were the initial “sparks” of tourism for the Branson area that over the years, has evolved into the Branson of today, with all it has to offer.
In 1959, Harold Bell Wright's novel was brought to life in an inspirational and spectacular fashion in the Shepherd of Hills Outdoor Drama, conducted on the very land where Wright wrote their novel. This action filled, inspirational drama has a cast of almost 100; is performed on an outdoor stage that is almost the size of a football field; has galloping horses, a buckboard, and the “Bald Knobbers” actually burning a cabin every night and will complete its 55th season with its Oct. 25, 2014 performance.
In 1960, the Mabe family decided to start a show to provide evening entertainment for the tourists who were coming to the Branson area as a result of a new theme park that had just opened, Silver Dollar City, and the completion of Table Rock Dam with its resulting 43,000 plus square acre Table Rock Lake. Bob Mabe, one of the original members of the group said that they came up with the name “Baldknobbers” and that it “was chosen from the book.” Anecdotally, they said, “I wished afterwards that I had said the “Mabe Brothers” instead because of the four of us brothers [Bill, Bob, Jim and Lyle].”
The Baldknobbers Jamboree has been continuously entertaining audiences ever since and is acknowledged as Branson's first show, but before there was a “Shepherd of the Hills,” novel, a “Branson” or a “Baldknobbers Jamboree” there was the “Bald Knobbers.”
Amid fierce clashes between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, one out of three Republicans voting in Wisconsin said they would abandon the party if either candidate is the ultimate nominee, according to early results from the NBC News Exit Poll.
When asked what they would do if Cruz were the GOP nominee in November, only 66 percent of Wisconsin Republicans said they'd vote for him. The remainder instead would vote for a third-party candidate (18 percent), vote for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton (6 percent) or not vote at all (5 percent).
The numbers got slightly worse for the Republican Party when voters were asked to consider Trump as the GOP nominee. Just 61 percent said they'd vote for the brash business person, with the rest defecting to a third party (18 percent) or to Clinton (10 percent)—or simply staying home (8 percent).
Wisconsin has long been a swing state in the nation's presidential elections, but these numbers suggest the party may have substantial difficulty staying competitive with the Democrats in the Badger State this November.
Zscaler, a nine-year-old, San Jose, Calif.-based company, has filed confidentially for IPO, multiple sources tell TechCrunch. The cloud security outfit is aiming to go public before the end of the year.
Zscaler works with companies like United Airlines and NBC to protect from threats across all devices. “Zscaler built its multi-tenant platform from scratch to provide 100% cloud security to every user in the enterprise, on any device, using any app, all over the world,” says the company website.
Zscaler has reached “unicorn” status, having raised capital at a $1 billion valuation in the past. Investors include Lightspeed Venture Partners, Alphabet's Capital G and TPG Growth.
Earlier this year, Reuters reported that Zscaler had been meeting with investment bankers to prepare for a possible offering. Bloomberg reported that Zscaler wound up picking Morgan Stanley to manage the IPO.
Zscaler has been involved in multiple patent lawsuits with Symantec. A recent ongoing suit “asserts that Zscaler has been illegally using Symantec's patented technology relating to a variety of network security technologies, including web security, security scanning, data loss prevention, intrusion prevention and intrusion signature analysis.”
Zscaler competes with Blue Coat, which was acquired by Symantec. It also competes with Cisco's Umbrella division.
Another security company, ForeScout Technologies, is planning to price its IPO later today. We broke the news of its IPO filing earlier this year.
Zscaler declined to comment on this story.

Below are the images and text of a Pecha Kucha talk I gave in Champaign, IL. The Pecha Kucha format is 20 slides x 20 seconds per slide. Hopefully the video will be online within a few months Video embedded above.
You are an information portal. Information enters through your senses, like your ears and eyes, and exits through your expressions, like your voice, your drawing, your writing, and your movements.
In order for culture to stay alive, we have to be open, or permeable. According to Wikipedia, Permeance is “the degree to which a material admits a flow of matter or energy.” We are the material through which information flows.
It's through this flow that culture stays alive and we stay connected to each other. Ideas flow in, and they flow out, of each of us. Ideas change a little as they go along; this is known as evolution, progress, or innovation.
But thanks to Copyright, we live in a world where some information goes in, but cannot legally come out.
Often I hear people engaged in creative pursuits ask, “Am I allowed to use this? I don't want to get in trouble.”
In our Copyright regime, “trouble” may include lawsuits, huge fines, and even jail. “Trouble” means violence. “Trouble” has shut down many a creative enterprise. So the threat of “trouble” dictates our choices about what we express.
Copyright activates our internal censors. Internal censorship is the enemy of creativity; it halts expression before it can begin. The question, “am I allowed to use this?” indicates the asker has surrendered internal authority to lawyers, legislators, and corporations.
This phenomenon is called Permission Culture. Whenever we censor our expression, we close a little more and information flows a little less. The less information flows, the more it stagnates. This is known as chilling effects.
I have asked myself: did I ever consent to letting “Permission Culture” into my brain? Why am I complying with censorship? How much choice do I really have about what information goes in and comes out of me?
The answer is: I have some choice regarding what I expose myself to, and what I express, but not total control. I can choose whether to watch mainstream media, for example. And I can choose what information to pass along.
But to be in the world, and to be open, means all kinds of things can and do get in that are beyond my control. I don't get to choose what goes in based on its copyright status. In fact proprietary images and sounds are the most aggressively rammed into our heads. For example:
“Have a holly jolly Christmas, It's the best time of the year
“I don't know if there'll be snow, but have a cup of cheer
“Have a holly jolly Christmas, And when you walk down the street
“Say hello to friends you know and everyone you meet!”
I hate Christmas music. But because I live in the U.S., and need to leave the house even in the months of November and December, I can't hear it. It goes right through my earholes and into my brain, where it plays over and over ad nauseum.
Here are some of the corporations I could “get in trouble with” for sharing that song and clip in public. I wasn't consulted by them before having their so-called “intellectual property” blasted into my head as a child, so I didn't ask their permission to put it in my slide show.
Copyright is automatic and there's no way to opt out. But you can add a license granting some of the permissions copyright automatically takes away. Creative Commons, the most widespread brand of license, allows its users to lift various restrictions of copyright one at a time.
The problem with licenses is that they're based on copyright law. The same threat of violence behind copyright is behind alternative licenses too. Licenses actually reinforce the mechanism of copyright. Everyone still needs to seek permission – it's just that they get it a little more often.
Like copyright itself, licenses are often too complex for most people to understand. So licenses have the unfortunate effect of encouraging people to pay even MORE attention to copyright, which gives even more authority to that inner censor. And who let that censor into our heads in the first place?
Although I use Free licenses and would appreciate meaningful copyright reform, licenses and laws aren't the solution. The solution is more and more people just ignoring copyright altogether. I want to be one of those people.
A few years ago I declared sovereignty over my own head. Freedom of Speech begins at home. Censorship and “trouble” still exist outside my head, and that's where they'll stay – OUTSIDE my head. I'm not going to assist bad laws and media corporations by setting up an outpost for them in my own mind.
I no longer favor or reject works based on their copyright status. Ideas aren't good or bad because of what licenses people slap on them. I just relate to the ideas themselves now, not the laws surrounding them. And I try to express myself the same way.
Like millions of others who don't give a rat's ass about copyright, I hope you join me. Make Art, Not Law.

About Clustergrams
In 2002, Matthias Schonlau published in “The Stata Journal” an article named “The Clustergram: A graph for visualizing hierarchical and . As explained in the abstract:
In hierarchical cluster analysis dendrogram graphs are used to visualize how clusters are formed. I propose an alternative graph named “clustergram” to examine how cluster members are assigned to clusters as the number of clusters increases.
This graph is useful in exploratory analysis for non-hierarchical clustering algorithms like k-means and for hierarchical cluster algorithms when the number of observations is large enough to make dendrograms impractical.
A similar article was later written and was (maybe) published in “computational statistics”.
Both articles give some nice background to known methods like k-means and methods for hierarchical clustering, and then goes on to present examples of using these methods (with the Clustergarm) to analyse some datasets.
Personally, I understand the clustergram to be a type of parallel coordinates plot where each observation is given a vector. The vector contains the observation's location according to how many clusters the dataset was split into. The scale of the vector is the scale of the first principal component of the data.
Clustergram in R (a basic function)
After finding out about this method of visualization, I was hunted by the curiosity to play with it a bit. Therefore, and since I didn't find any implementation of the graph in R, I went about writing the code to implement it.
The code only works for kmeans, but it shows how such a plot can be produced, and could be later modified so to offer methods that will connect with different clustering algorithms.
How does the function work: The function I present here gets a data.frame/matrix with a row for each observation, and the variable dimensions present in the columns.
The function assumes the data is scaled.
The function then goes about calculating the cluster centers for our data, for varying number of clusters.
For each cluster iteration, the cluster centers are multiplied by the first loading of the principal components of the original data. Thus offering a weighted mean of the cluster center dimensions that might give a decent representation of that cluster (this method has the known limitations of using the first component of a PCA for dimensionality reduction, but I won't go into that in this post).
Finally all of our data points are ordered according to their respective cluster first component, and plotted against the number of clusters (thus creating the clustergram).
My thank goes to Hadley Wickham for offering some good tips on how to prepare the graph.
Here is the code (example follows)
The R function can be downloaded from here
Corrections and remarks can be added in the comments bellow, or on the github code page.
Example on the iris dataset
The iris data set is a favorite example of many R bloggers when writing about R accessors , Data Exporting, Data importing, and for different visualization techniques.
So it seemed only natural to experiment on it here.
source ( "https://www.r-statistics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/source_https.r.txt" ) # Making sure we can source code from github source_https ( "https://raw.github.com/talgalili/R-code-snippets/master/clustergram.r" ) data ( iris ) set. seed ( 250 ) par ( cex. lab = 1.5 , cex. main = 1.2 ) Data <- scale ( iris [ , - 5 ] ) # notice I am scaling the vectors) clustergram ( Data, k. range = 2 : 8 , line. width = 0.004 ) # notice how I am using line.width. Play with it on your problem, according to the scale of Y.
Here is the output:
Looking at the image we can notice a few interesting things. We notice that one of the clusters formed (the lower one) stays as is no matter how many clusters we are allowing (except for one observation that goes way and then beck).
We can also see that the second split is a solid one (in the sense that it splits the first cluster into two clusters which are not “close” to each other, and that about half the observations goes to each of the new clusters).
And then notice how moving to 5 clusters makes almost no difference.
Lastly, notice how when going for 8 clusters, we are practically left with 4 clusters (remember – this is according the mean of cluster centers by the loading of the first component of the PCA on the data)
If I where to take something from this graph, I would say I have a strong tendency to use 3-4 clusters on this data.
But wait, did our clustering algorithm do a stable job?
Let's try running the algorithm 6 more times (each run will have a different starting point for the clusters)
source ( "https://www.r-statistics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/source_https.r.txt" ) # Making sure we can source code from github source_https ( "https://raw.github.com/talgalili/R-code-snippets/master/clustergram.r" ) set. seed ( 500 ) Data <- scale ( iris [ , - 5 ] ) # notice I am scaling the vectors) par ( cex. lab = 1.2 , cex. main = .7 ) par ( mfrow = c ( 3 , 2 ) ) for ( i in 1 : 6 ) clustergram ( Data, k. range = 2 : 8 , line. width = .004, add. center . points = T )
Resulting with: (press the image to enlarge it)
Repeating the analysis offers even more insights.
First, it would appear that until 3 clusters, the algorithm gives rather stable results.
From 4 onwards we get various outcomes at each iteration.
At some of the cases, we got 3 clusters when we asked for 4 or even 5 clusters.
Reviewing the new plots, I would prefer to go with the 3 clusters option. Noting how the two “upper” clusters might have similar properties while the lower cluster is quite distinct from the other two.
By the way, the Iris data set is composed of three types of flowers. I imagine the kmeans had done a decent job in distinguishing the three.
Limitation of the method (and a possible way to overcome it?!)
It is worth noting that the current way the algorithm is built has a fundamental limitation: The plot is good for detecting a situation where there are several clusters but each of them is clearly “bigger” then the one before it (on the first principal component of the data).
For example, let's create a dataset with 3 clusters, each one is taken from a normal distribution with a higher mean:
source ( "https://www.r-statistics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/source_https.r.txt" ) # Making sure we can source code from github source_https ( "https://raw.github.com/talgalili/R-code-snippets/master/clustergram.r" ) set. seed ( 250 ) Data <- rbind ( cbind ( rnorm ( 100 , 0 , sd = 0.3 ) , rnorm ( 100 , 0 , sd = 0.3 ) , rnorm ( 100 , 0 , sd = 0.3 ) ) , cbind ( rnorm ( 100 , 1 , sd = 0.3 ) , rnorm ( 100 , 1 , sd = 0.3 ) , rnorm ( 100 , 1 , sd = 0.3 ) ) , cbind ( rnorm ( 100 , 2 , sd = 0.3 ) , rnorm ( 100 , 2 , sd = 0.3 ) , rnorm ( 100 , 2 , sd = 0.3 ) ) ) clustergram ( Data, k. range = 2 : 5 , line. width = .004, add. center . points = T )
The resulting plot for this is the following:
The image shows a clear distinction between three ranks of clusters. There is no doubt (for me) from looking at this image, that three clusters would be the correct number of clusters.
But what if the clusters where different but didn't have an ordering to them?
For example, look at the following 4 dimensional data:
source ( "https://www.r-statistics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/source_https.r.txt" ) # Making sure we can source code from github source_https ( "https://raw.github.com/talgalili/R-code-snippets/master/clustergram.r" ) set. seed ( 250 ) Data <- rbind ( cbind ( rnorm ( 100 , 1 , sd = 0.3 ) , rnorm ( 100 , 0 , sd = 0.3 ) , rnorm ( 100 , 0 , sd = 0.3 ) , rnorm ( 100 , 0 , sd = 0.3 ) ) , cbind ( rnorm ( 100 , 0 , sd = 0.3 ) , rnorm ( 100 , 1 , sd = 0.3 ) , rnorm ( 100 , 0 , sd = 0.3 ) , rnorm ( 100 , 0 , sd = 0.3 ) ) , cbind ( rnorm ( 100 , 0 , sd = 0.3 ) , rnorm ( 100 , 1 , sd = 0.3 ) , rnorm ( 100 , 1 , sd = 0.3 ) , rnorm ( 100 , 0 , sd = 0.3 ) ) , cbind ( rnorm ( 100 , 0 , sd = 0.3 ) , rnorm ( 100 , 0 , sd = 0.3 ) , rnorm ( 100 , 0 , sd = 0.3 ) , rnorm ( 100 , 1 , sd = 0.3 ) ) ) clustergram ( Data, k. range = 2 : 8 , line. width = .004, add. center . points = T )
In this situation, it is not clear from the location of the clusters on the Y axis that we are dealing with 4 clusters.
But what is interesting, is that through the growing number of clusters, we can notice that there are 4 “strands” of data points moving more or less together (until we reached 4 clusters, at which point the clusters started breaking up).
Another hope for handling this might be using the color of the lines in some way, but I haven't yet figured out how.
Clustergram with ggplot2
Hadley Wickham has kindly played with recreating the clustergram using the ggplot2 engine. You can see the result here:
http://gist.github.com/439761
And this is what they wrote about it in the comments:
I've broken it down into three components:
* run the clustering algorithm and get predictions (many_kmeans and all_hclust)
* produce the data for the clustergram (clustergram)
* plot it (plot.clustergram)
I don't think I have the logic behind the y-position adjustment quite right though.
Conclusions (some rules of thumb and questions for the future)
In a first look, it would appear that the clustergram can be of use. I can imagine using this graph to quickly run various clustering algorithms and then compare them to each other and review their stability (In the way I just demonstrated in the example above).
The three rules of thumb I have noticed by now are:
Look at the location of the cluster points on the Y axis. See when they remain stable, when they start flying around, and what happens to them in higher number of clusters (do they re-group together) Observe the strands of the datapoints. Even if the clusters centers are not ordered, the lines for each item might (needs more research and thinking) tend to move together – hinting at the real number of clusters Run the plot multiple times to observe the stability of the cluster formation (and location)
Yet there is more work to be done and questions to seek answers to:
The code needs to be extended to offer methods to various clustering algorithms.
How can the colors of the lines be used better?
How can this be done using other graphical engines (ggplot2/lattice?) – ( Update : look at Hadley's reply in the comments)
: look at Hadley's reply in the comments) What to do in case the first principal component doesn't capture enough of the data? (maybe plot this graph to all the relevant components. but then – how do you make conclusions of it?)
What other uses/conclusions can be made based on this graph?
I am looking forward to reading your input/ideas in the comments (or in reply posts).
Cord-Cutting Is Accelerating At A Pace That Scares Cable Companies
If you still rely on for cable television for all of your entertainment needs, you probably don't know how to use a DVD player or the DVR that comes with your cable. People are cutting the cord on cable because it's becoming a thing of the past. Streaming ad-free entertainment or loading up your devices with content is where most people are turning… and that scares the cable companies.
“This year, the number of digital video services expanded at a faster pace than ever before,” explained eMarketer's senior analyst Paul Verna in a statement. “In addition to standalone offerings from the likes of HBO, there are new digital bundles that include many of the channels consumers could only have received with cable and satellite subscriptions in the past. This widespread availability of digital content makes cord-cutting a viable option for a growing segment of the viewing population.”
The only thing that really keeps me holding on to my very basic cable package is sports. Sports is cables killer app. But, as more and more streaming services become available — legal or illegal — the reason to stay with cable is becoming illogical. The only time I ever watch a show live is if it's Game of Thrones, and HBO now has a streaming service where I don't need to have the channel on cable. Sitting through an hour of The Walking Dead live in unbearable. There are so many ads played that I forget what I'm watching.
Take note, cable companies, you better do a better job of holding on to your customers, because your days could be numbered. Also, don't keep changing my bill every month when I haven't changed anything to deserve it.

If you kill someone in a traffic accident or a bar fight in British Columbia, you are likely to go to jail. But if you are an employer whose recklessness contributes to an employee's death, the public record suggests you will, at worst, be assessed a modest fine.
Negligent Bosses Go Undercharged for Worker Deaths, Critics Say read more
Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners ‘Punch to the Gut' Musical on Residential Schools Returns to Vancouver Children of God has been shaped by intense audience reactions, says director Corey Payette.
The penalty paid for a company's role in the death of a B.C. worker in 2012 was, on average, less than $22,000.
A report by WorkSafeBC, the province's worker compensation board, shows that of 149 worker deaths accepted for compensation payments in the 2012 reporting period, six prompted fines against employers, for a total of less than $129,000.
Over half of the deaths were related to past asbestos exposure, and a smaller number to silicosis, according to Al Johnson, WorkSafeBC's vice-president of prevention services. Another 15 to 20 per cent were caused by motor vehicle accidents, leaving about 40 deaths caused by trauma inflicted on the job.
As for criminal penalties, not a single company executive or manager has ever gone to jail in B.C. under the Westray Act, passed in 2004 after a decade of trade union lobbying to hold reckless managers accountable when their decisions kill workers.
Six firms fined
All six fines imposed by WorkSafeBC in 2012 were related to worker deaths that occurred several years ago, as the inspection and penalty assessment process can be lengthy.
Lexspan Ltd. Partnership of Burnaby drew the highest fatality-related fine of 2012, assessed at $58,820.05 for the 2009 death of a worker killed after the gooseneck hoist on a flat bed truck fell, caught and crushed the worker. The WorkSafeBC inspector cited the firm for "inadequate health and safety planning." According to the inspector, "this employer has not provided the workers with adequate information, instruction, training to ensure the health and safety of those workers in carrying out their work and to ensure the health and safety of other workers at the workplace."
The next highest death fine was levied against Integrated Production Services Ltd. of Dawson Creek, charged $31,617.86 for the 2008 death of a worker in an Encana natural gas well site explosion that also left two other workers badly burned. The inspector noted the "...lack of [a] job specific fire and explosion hazard management plan" as a factor in the death and injuries.
At Seaward Kayaks, Ltd. in Chemainus, a worker welding on a metal drum was killed in 2009 when acetone vapours in the drum exploded. WorkSafeBC fined the company $13,612.60, citing "inadequate supervision" as a factor in the death.
Weather Tight Supplies Ltd. of Sechelt was fined $6,961.10 for a 2011 worker death that resulted from a roofer's fall through an unprotected opening nearly 18 feet above a hard surface. The inspector's report cited lack of fall protection and lack of adequate supervision in this death.
In 2007, a forklift tipped over and killed an employee of MGA Italstone Ltd. of Surrey. The inspector found the company "failed to take sufficient precautions for the prevention of work related injuries or illnesses," and imposed a $4,554.35 fine.
A $3,250 fine was imposed on Chiman Homes Ltd. of Surrey for another lethal fall, a 15-foot plunge suffered by a watchman working alone at night at a job site in 2010. In this case the inspector also said the employer "... failed to take sufficient precautions for the prevention of work related injuries or illnesses."
WorkSafeBC allows employers to appeal fines. For example, while the U.S.-based construction giant Kiewit was fined $250,000 dollars in 2011 for its part in the death of Sam Fitzpatrick at the Toba Inlet project, on appeal the company saw its penalty reduced to $100,000 despite the appeal tribunal's comment that Kiewit "...committed high risk violations with reckless disregard" for consequences.
Fines levelled against employers in 2012 could still be reduced or eliminated on appeal.
'One death is too many'
Johnson called the penalty amounts for worker deaths "appropriate."
"Don't get me wrong, one death is too many, and we take every death and injury very seriously," Johnson said in an interview. "But our purpose is not so much to find fault as it is to ensure accident prevention in the future. Besides, how can you put a dollar value on a human life?"
Johnson said that once an employer is found at fault in a worker death, the size of the fine is determined by a complicated formula that takes into account the size of the employer's payroll. A smaller firm will be fined less than a big one, even for similar injuries or deaths.
The most important number related to worker deaths isn't the size of the fines, said BC Federation of Labour President Jim Sinclair.
"The important number is how many workers died. In almost every case, death was avoidable," Sinclair said. "It is clear that the present system isn't working. We have to end the double standard that treats deaths at work differently from deaths anywhere else."
This month, the United Steelworkers union is launching a national campaign, "Stop the Killing, Enforce the Law," to highlight what they say is woeful under-enforcement of the Westray Act, the legislation intended to hold reckless management in Canada accountable for actions that lead to worker deaths.
"Over the past years, Crown counsels in this province have turned down recommendations for criminal charges in workplace deaths whenever they were made by law enforcement officers. We are deeply concerned about this," Sinclair said.
A public event about the Stop the Killing Campaign will be held in Vancouver on Monday, Oct. 28 and will include a panel of family members of workers who died on the job. Relatives of John Wilson, a union member who drowned in a tailings pond at the Craigmont Mine outside Merritt in 2008, will participate. Wilson was trapped in an excavator that was improperly modified in a way that blocked the escape hatch.
Steelworker officer Ron Corbeil said the union was considering an attempt to lay a private prosecution against mine managers in Wilson's death.
Sinclair said he's cautiously optimistic that change is coming to how workplace deaths are dealt with in the province.
They said a meeting between labour leaders and Attorney General and Justice Minister Suzanne Anton is planned for the near future. Sinclair hopes it will lead to the government adopting a new protocol for investigating workplace deaths that more clearly spells out roles for RCMP, local police and WorkSafeBC investigators, ultimately leading to better enforcement of the Westray Act.
"Implementation is going to be key," they cautioned. "It is going to take efforts from everyone concerned."
I sense that our motives for taking part in an action for peace are crucial to the effectiveness of that action. But I am not clear about my motives. I can't say with confidence that I am moved more by love for enemies (in this case, warmongers and other violent people) than by a desire to shame them for not loving their enemies. Do I want to express my love, improve the world, assuage my guilt, look and feel morally superior to others – or are all of those motivations, and more, at work? Fearing that “when the wrong person uses the right means, the right means work in the wrong way,” I am unable to assess the usefulness of specific actions until I have deeper insight into my own motivations and goals. I am, therefore, uncertain about taking action, even as I feel the urgent need for effective peacemaking.
The Quaker tradition recognizes that such unclarity arises, paradoxically, from the illuminating work of the spirit of love, that inward light which reveals what is normally hidden. The recommended response is to examine oneself and one's actions in that light. When I do that, what do I see?
I see that there is violence within me, and I understand that my violence is bound up with my self-absorbed approach to life, an approach that is inherently divisive because I reflexively – I intend that word in a double sense: my natural reflex is to feel and think in this way – interpret life as competition between self and other. Both intra- and interpersonally, I am caught up in struggle for dominance, entangled in the roots of violence. But I also see that love can work in and through me to overcome that fundamental alienation, and that peace is the living of that love in everyday situations.
Our Religious Society has for centuries borne witness to the possibility of peace within and among us. I am convinced that to continue that witness is one of our most important tasks today. I am also convinced that we can do so only by learning to live in that spirit which “takes away [from us] the occasion of all wars,” rooting out our deep-seated alienation and lust for self-aggrandizement. I understand that I can bring some peace to the world only if I can live peace in and for the world. But how can I learn to be thus reconciled to self and other?
I need to focus on how I come into that spirit which, in James Nayler's words, “delights to do no evil nor to avenge any wrong, … and takes its kingdom with entreaty, and not with contention, and keeps it by lowliness of mind.” It is clear to me that this spirit is not an ideal to which I can conform myself — self-idealization being a work of alienation — but a power which abides within me and to which I may come increasingly to surrender. And it is clear, too, that I cannot simply reframe as self-surrender an attempt to embody a standard or ideal: I know experimentally (as George Fox would say) that conformity to law is but a self-aggrandizing ersatz of love.
Under love's light, I see that I tend to devote my energy to developing and projecting a “good” — that is, better — image of myself, both for myself and for others. I want to believe myself to be, and to be known by others as, a person who is genuinely peaceful, who has surrendered to the spirit of love. But an imagined surrender is just that: imaginary. A ploy of self-idealization. A genuinely peaceful person does not experience him- or themselves as over against self or other and therefore does not desire to be “better.” Leading me out of alienation, love is inviting me to give up attachment to any and all self-images. I think that allowing myself to respond to that invitation must be the real meaning of surrender. And of peace.
(This essay is adapted from my journal entry of 4/10/1988.)
The boycott appears straightforward: Mohammad Hosseini, Iran's culture minister, on Tuesday confirmed that their country would not submit a film for consideration at next year's Oscars in protest of “Innocence of Muslims,” the anti-Islam YouTube video that has sparked deadly riots. They specifically cited the “failure” of Oscar organizers to take an official position on the incendiary “film.”
But Iran's move left Hollywood scratching its head. Iran, which won the Academy Award for best foreign language film earlier this year, was seriously going to boycott moviedom's biggest prize because the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences hadn't denounced a crude YouTube video made by a former gas station owner? (The academy had no comment.)
The deadline for submissions is Oct. 1, and the country had planned to submit “A Cube of Sugar,” a dramatic comedy by Reza Mirkarimi about a wedding that turns into a funeral; Variety called the picture “slim but vibrant” in its review.
The movie site HitFix.com wondered this: If a viral video is causing outrage by depicting one's culture in a negative light, what sense does it make to deny Western exposure to more positive cultural expressions of your country? “Sitting out this particular Oscar race,” Hitfix concluded in an echo of what other movie experts were saying on Tuesday, “is a gesture so minor as to affect only the filmmaker who would otherwise compete.”
Iran's winning submission at the last Oscars, “A Separation,” about a collapsing marriage, was also dragged into politics, to the consternation of its director, Asghar Farhadi. After it won — beating out an Israeli submission and three others — Javad Shamaghdari, the top official at Iran's cinema agency, described it as “the beginning of the collapse” of Israeli influence in America.
I've really had it with the Obama Administration making the case that we must include entitlement reforms (cutting Social Security & Medicare benefits) to solve our fiscal problems -- especially when they begin equating realistic concerns about what those cuts would have on the American people with the nonsensical right-wing ideological war waged by Grover Norquist, dedicated to the proposition that Republicans can never raise taxes, evah! How does this argument meet the requirements of a reality-based populace?
In post-election remarks at the University of Delaware, Plouffe warned of "paralysis" if both parties remain beholden to their base, saying Obama is looking for a deal that sets the country on the right fiscal path for a 10- to 20-year period. "The only way that gets done is for Republicans again to step back and get mercilessly criticized by Grover Norquist and the Right, and it means that Democrats are going to have to do some tough things on spending and entitlements that means that they'll criticize on by their left," Plouffe said at their alma mater in conversation with former McCain campaign manager Steve Schmidt.
There is no evidence to back up anything Grover Norquist and the GOP assert while making their endless claims that low tax rates create jobs and that raising federal revenues and taxes is innately EVIL. It's actually the opposite:
There is not conclusive evidence, however, to substantiate a clear relationship between the 65-year steady reduction in the top tax rates and economic growth. Analysis of such data suggests the reduction in the top tax rates have had little association with saving, investment, or productivity growth. However, the top tax rate reductions appear to be associated with the increasing concentration of income at the top of the income distribution. The share of income accruing to the top 0.1% of U.S. families increased from 4.2% in 1945 to 12.3% by 2007 before falling to 9.2% due to the 2007-2009 recession. The evidence does not suggest necessarily a relationship between tax policy with regard to the top tax rates and the size of the economic pie, but there may be a relationship to how the economic pie is sliced.

I forgot, Republicans had a cow over this report by the Congressional Research Service and had it pulled.
On the other hand, there is plenty of real evidence that raising retirement ages for Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid and implementing the chained CPI will have a devastating effect on the middle class.
But what, ask the deficit scolds, do people like me propose doing about rising spending? The answer is to do what every other advanced country does, and make a serious effort to rein in health care costs. Give Medicare the ability to bargain over drug prices. Let the Independent Payment Advisory Board, created as part of Obamacare to help Medicare control costs, do its job instead of crying “death panels.” (And isn't it odd that the same people who demagogue attempts to help Medicare save money are eager to throw millions of people out of the program altogether?) We know that we have a health care system with skewed incentives and bloated costs, so why don't we try to fix it? What we know for sure is that there is no good case for denying older Americans access to the programs they count on. This should be a red line in any budget negotiations, and we can only hope that Mr. Obama doesn't betray their supporters by crossing it.
Negotiating a fiscal deal should have everything to do with facts and what works and not just to make right-wing extremists happy. Whenever David Brooks gleefully says how fit 67-year-olds look these days, I simply shudder.
BROOKS: Have you looked at 67-year-olds recently? They look the way 40-year-olds used to look. These days we have many people who don't enter the labor force until they are 22 and then they leave at 64 and die at 85. We can't sustain a society in which people work for 42 years of their lives and live as dependents or non-workers for 43 years of their lives.
What an embarrassment they are. But then there's David Plouffe in the above video.
Plouffe is completely ridiculous here -- and so is what Rep. James Clyburn is saying to Andrea Mitchell from Monday's show, below. Giving the American people massive pain over scraps just so Grover takes a short term hit is absolutely cruel.
[oldembed width="420" height="245" src="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32545640" flashvars="launch=49968910&width=420&height=245" fid="2"]
I thought Rep. Clyburn wanted to kiss Bob Corker after watching this.
I heard Senator Corker earlier on your program. I was very very pleased because they are exactly where I am on all these issues.
Digby breaks down what Rep. Clyburn is so excited about in Corker's plan:
MUCH has been said in recent weeks about Tony Blair's speech on Islam. Most of it has been vitriolic. As Bagehot noted in their column last week, Mr Blair attracts an astonishing degree of opprobrium. On the right, Peter Oborne has daubed them with “the degradation of our democracy”. On the left, Seumas Milne described their speech as an “anti-democratic tirade”.
This is unfortunate. Whatever one thinks of Mr Blair's views on foreign policy (or their generously compensated retirement pursuits) their past actions have much to teach today's politicians. Knee-jerk hostility obscures useful precedents.

Consider the current panic about UKIP. David Cameron has spent the second half of their first (and perhaps only) term in power reacting to the threat it poses. They have issued tough talk on immigration, a guarantee of a rush-referendum on EU membership and, most recently, an oddly anachronistic insistence that today's sceptical Britain is, in fact, a Christian country. To little effect: in recent months support for UKIP has soared. Mr Blair (who despite their own faith always refused to “do god” as prime minister) would have avoided such concessions, preferring instead to aggressively challenge Nigel Farage's arguments and factual distortions as they did when the two clashed in the European Parliament in 2005.
The European question in particular demonstrates how sensible Mr Blair's approach was. For all the current talk of a popular clamour over Britain's relationship with the EU, voters' interest in the subject was much more lively in the early 2000s. In the 2001 election campaign the opposition Conservatives, convinced that voters were exercised about the issue, campaigned on a fiercely anti-EU platform. Mr Blair largely ignored this, insisting that European engagement was in Britain's best economic interests and betting that voters would reward them for concentrating on bread-and-butter concerns. It paid off: they were rewarded with a second landslide victory. By contrast, Mr Cameron has allowed an anti-European party that has won no parliamentary seats—and whose leader is strikingly reluctant to expose themselves to popular judgment—to dictate much of Britain's foreign policy.
But beyond Mr Blair's stance on specific issues, it is their broader demeanour that has most to teach the politicians of 2014. Some chide the former prime minister for being an “actor” and attribute the disillusion of those Britons now flirting with UKIP to their and others' showmanship. They are wrong. Populism is not new. Nor are the economic struggles of ordinary voters. Those who chalk up UKIP's success to joblessness and stagnant wages should look at unemployment rate in the 1980s, or wages in the mid-2000s. Neither explains the insurgent party's recent surge. Nor does it explain why figures like Boris Johnson—just as showy and well-established as Mr Blair—continue to thrive politically in post-recession, UKIP-tinged Britain.
The truth (unpalatable to many in Westminster) is that voters like leaders like Mr Blair: salespersons, performers and, yes, actors. Politicians who win their affections should not feel guilty. They are doing their job as representatives: persuading people, speaking their language, garnering their trust.
So in their irrational hatred for a man who thrice achieved a level of popular approbation—a parliamentary majority—that still eludes David Cameron, commentators are missing an important point: the more UKIP's star rises, the more Westminster needs a hefty dose of Tony Blair. After all, can anyone imagine David Cameron delivering the riposte to Mr Farage, in the middle of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, that Mr Blair did in 2005?
Let me just tell you, sir, and your colleagues: you sit with our country's flag; you do not represent our country's interests. This is the year: 2005, not 1945. We're not fighting each other any more. These are our partners. They're our colleagues and our future lies in Europe. And when you and your colleagues say ‘what do we get in return for what we contribute to enlargement?', I'll tell you what we get. We get a Europe that is unified after years of dictatorship in the east. We get economic development in countries whom we have championed. We get a future reform that allows us—once and for all—to put an end to discussion about rebates, common agricultural policy, and get a proper budget for Europe. That's what we get if we have the vision to seize that opportunity.
Anyone?

Home security isn't something to take lightly. Having external cameras on your property can boost your home security, and the Kuna lighting and camera combination provides a stylish alternative to standard outdoor security cameras.
Whether you live in the city or out in the country, there are always security concerns outside your home. Whether it's vandals trying to pick the lock on your front door, or vermin foraging through your garden while you're away at work, an external security camera can bring you a peace of mind that few other security solutions can.
The Kuna security light is somewhat unique in that it combines the usefulness of an outdoor security camera Build a Motion Capture Security System Using a Raspberry Pi Build a Motion Capture Security System Using a Raspberry Pi Of the many projects that you can build with the Raspberry Pi, one of the most interesting and permanently useful is the motion capture security system.

With three different styles to choose from – two of them in black or bronze – you'll likely find one that looks really good mounted outside of your home or business.
Read on to find out how you could win your very own Kuna external lighting security system, worth $200.

Compared to my old external lighting unit, the Kuna is quite a bit larger, at about two inches taller and an inch wider.
However, where my former external light was mounted on a full cast-iron body, the Kuna aluminum sconce felt a bit flimsier and lower quality. Going with a bronze color may be smarter, since the black body gives it the appearance of a plastic electronic device.
The body of the sconce itself, and the mounting bracket, has the feel of solid aluminum though, and I have no doubt that it'll be capable of withstanding the elements of a Maine winter. I do wonder how to camera, microphone and the electronics will hold out in sub-zero weather though.
The camera that is mounted below and slightly tucked behind the sconce itself is easy to miss unless you look directly at the light itself, which few visitors ever bother to do. The painted black round camera body blends in with the rest of the unit, and is held firm behind a rotating locking ring that you can tighten or loosen to re-position the direction of the camera. The camera is then fixed, with no remotely controllable pan/tilt features.
In our case, I was able to loosen the ring and swivel the security camera How to Build a Security Camera Network Out Of Old Smartphones How to Build a Security Camera Network Out Of Old Smartphones There's no better use of old smartphones than by building your own DIY network security camera system -- we show you everything you need to know! Read More off to the right so that we can capture a bit of our walkway, as well as the part of our porch where people stand before opening the external door. This provides time for the camera to get a clear shot of every visitor's face as they enter the home.
The value of this for us is that if thief ever breaks in using the main entrance (either breaking the window and unlocking the door, or picking the lock), a clear image of the perp's face will already be captured and uploaded to the cloud.
In fact, this is the most likely scenario if a would-be thief approaches the main door of your house to break in.
You will instantly receive an audio alarm on your phone that someone has arrived at the door. Using both the live video feed and the recorded video, you can determine whether that person is a stranger who shouldn't be there. You can either press a button to talk to the stranger, or simply enable to loud audio alarm to scare them away. If the person doesn't leave, you can dial 9-11 about a robbery in progress at your home. Even if the person gets away, and even if they destroy the camera, you'll have their face captured to the cloud to share with police.
The folks at Kuna aren't kidding when they list that the unit comes with a high-fidelity speaker for the alarm. When I first tested the alarm, it was quite startling. It is a 100 dB alarm that I could hear clear across the property and over at my neighbor's property. It's a lower-pitched 100 dB emergency-horn, as compared to the screetching 85 dB alarm of a standard U.S. smoke detector. So it's a little louder, but not as ear-shattering.
Beyond just the security benefits of having a video-alarm motion-detection system How To Build A WiFi Home Surveillance System With Your PC How To Build A WiFi Home Surveillance System With Your PC Read More outside your home, is the peace of mind of being able to keep an eye on your family while you can't be home.
If you work all day, or if you have to travel for businesses for a week at a time, there is nothing quite as comforting as being able to watch the comings-and-goings of your family members as they spend time outdoors, or just come and go during the day.
Personally, this is my favorite thing about owning a Kuna. My family and I have even had conversations over the system (sort of like a cloud-based intercom How To Build Your Own Baby Monitor How To Build Your Own Baby Monitor If you're a recent parent, you've probably considered getting some sort of baby monitor.

Software
The current first-generation Kuna app via either Google Play or iTunes App Store, free to install and use with your Kuna security light, is pretty simple to use. After you first install your light and then the Kuna app, you'll need to add your camera to your Kuna cloud.
Initially, you need to use bluetooth What Is Bluetooth? [Technology Explained] What Is Bluetooth? [Technology Explained] Read More to connect with the Kuna light and add it to your network. If you have multiple Kuna lights, this is where you'll add them one at a time, to your network of security lights.
Once you've connected to the Kuna via Bluetooth, you'll need to tell it which wireless network you want it to connect to. At my house I use two sub-networks via a bridge How to Turn an Old Router Into a Wireless Bridge How to Turn an Old Router Into a Wireless Bridge Not sure what to do with your old router? Try turning it into a wireless bridge! The process is surprisingly straightforward. Read More , and the Kuna recognized both of them as valid networks available to connect to.
Once you give it the network password, it'll connect your new camera to the network, and also the secure Kuna cloud network.
Initially, I had preliminary problems getting my app to correctly connect to the camera (it displayed the camera as offline when it really wasn't), and to display the live video feed in a timely manner. When someone arrives at the door, I'd really like to instantly connect to the camera so I can catch them at the door. I don't want to see a loading icon for 25 seconds. By the time the camera feed shows, they'll be gone!
The good news is that within 24 hours, these kinks worked themselves out. I'm not sure if the Kuna folks were fixing things on the back end, but I did notice the next day that I had absolutely no problems connecting to the live feed of the security camera – with maybe a 5-7 second load-time, which is reasonable.
Playback of each motion-detected session worked flawlessly – I captured myself playing around with the app while standing right in front of the doorway. I did have another temporary issue with playing back a few recorded messages – but again, that issue appeared to resolve itself after a few more hours of using the camera, and never happened again.
After a day or so, once all the kinks seemed to work themselves out, testing the camera worked seamlessly. Whenever you open the app, you'll see a thumbnail image of the latest still from the security camera. What I loved about this is I could just open up the app and see whether or not my family was home (car in the driveway).
Then, it dawned on me that this could also be a security flaw if a hacker could gain access to your camera. They could figure out whether you're home or not, or worse, review the recorded motion-detected videos to ascertain the time of day when you typically leave your home. Obviously choosing highly-secure passwords for your Kuna cloud account is very important.

Testing of the live video conversation with a visitor worked almost-flawlessly. I say “almost” because with my Samsung Galaxy's volume at 30%, I couldn't hear my daughter talking, and contacted the Kuna tech contact for some help troubleshooting. They suggested making sure my phone's speaker wasn't muted (well, of course Ms. Obvious!), but as it turned out that was sort-of the answer. I needed to turn my phone's volume up to 100% to clearly hear sound from the Kuna's microphone.
Once I did that however, the sound quality was very good – the Kuna captures everything during the recorded video sessions. I could hear planes in the sky, cars passing by, and even the wind in the trees in the back yard.
You can go back in time and see every single motion-activated recorded video event. You can manage them all right from the app, whether you want to watch them, download them to your device Your Cloud Media Center: How To Stream Videos From Dropbox Your Cloud Media Center: How To Stream Videos From Dropbox You'll want to watch your videos on your laptop one day, and on your media center the next. A simple solution to this problem can be found with Dropbox, but not the way you're thinking.... Read More , or delete them.
Currently “Cloud Recordings” is a free feature while the Kuna folks are working out the bugs, but I can only assume this will soon become a fee-based “premium” feature since these video recordings are sure to consume a great deal of space over time. A preview of the plans shows that the minimum pricing is $50/year, per camera for unlimited 7-days worth of recordings. You can of course save these to your device for more permanence should the need arise, but you may want to consider if this inevitable ongoing cost is acceptable to you.
It would be nice to be able to further customize the motion detection capabilities of this device. You can currently set the motion sensitivity from 0 to 100%, but it would be helpful to add a delay to the motion activation so that you could ignore the 10-15 seconds when you're arriving or leaving the house. This would allow you to only capture video when someone is standing outside of your locked door and knocking, or trying to get in.
Currently you can set up when you want to receive alerts every time the motion detection goes off or not, and you an also set the Kuna security light to “disarm” on a specific schedule, for instance to only receive alerts and video recordings when you're at work.
The light schedule is useful. You can set up the light to turn on at dusk and off at dawn. Or, if you're more energy conscious, you can turn those off and instead use the “Motion On” feature so the light turns on when you are at the door.
As a side note: don't be misled by the specification listed on the Kuna site (as of this writing) that this device has “night vision”. By night vision, they mean that the motion-detection will turn on the light at night so that the Kuna can still see what's there. The device does not have actual IR “night-vision” capability. The Kuna team advised us that they will be revising their website to make this more obvious to potential buyers.
One final observation on using motion to control the light is that currently the time delay between motion sensed and the light turning on is not as fast as it should be. Even with motion sensitivity set at 95%, I find that the light turns on only after I've been standing at the door for 3 seconds, rather than when I'm approaching the camera from my walkway, which is when I'd really like to see where I'm walking.
Should You Buy It?
Aside from those minor issues, I find the Kuna security light a tremendous improvement over the old-school external switch-controlled light. I find myself using the Kuna daily to keep an eye on my family and make sure everything is safe at home.
Our verdict of the Kuna security light :
Given that it is so simple to set up with basic tools (and keeping electrical safety in mind), and that it has all of the core features that I would personally expect from an outdoor light and security camera, I would recommend it to anyone who owns a home – it's just in time for the holiday season! 8 10

ORLANDO – It took Rafael dos Anjos just 66 seconds to put away Donald Cerrone, and just five minutes to tell UFC featherweight champion Conor McGregor to come get some.
With the talk of McGregor moving up to 155 pounds for an immediate title shot against the winner of Saturday night's main event at UFC on FOX 17, Dos Anjos made it clear they would be waiting for the Irishman. After defeating longtime champion Jose Aldo in 13 seconds last weekend at UFC 194, McGregor made it clear they wanted to hold dual titles at 145 and 155.
Dos Anjos, who hurt Cerrone early with a knee to the body and finished them after punishing them with punches, welcomes the challenge.
They told Joe Rogan as much in the cage in their post-fight interview after defending their title against Cerrone. And in the post-fight press conference, Dos Anjos said if the partition comes down for it to happen, he'd be more than happy to accommodate McGregor.
"Yeah, we are not even in the same division," Dos Anjos said. "He's a featherweight, and I'm a lightweight. But, he's saying they want to come to the lightweight division, if they come I will be here."
McGregor isn't 100 percent sure what their next move will be, especially with featherweight contender Frankie Edgar primed and ready for their shot. Timetables would have to mesh, which they might since both McGregor and Dos Anjos fought just a week apart.
Asked when he'd like to get back in there, Dos Anjos said they would like it to be soon.
"Yeah, since I won the fight against Pettis [at UFC 185], I had my MCL injury and it took me maybe four months to get better," they said. "And finally here I am defending my belt, and I didn't have any injuries. I'm looking forward to coming back as soon as possible. Conor McGregor has said they want to come to my division, and I think it will not be a smart decision for him. But if they want to come I have to overcome him."
As for their quick handling of Cerrone, who was riding an eight-fight winning streak coming in, the 31-year old Dos Anjos said it was all about capitalizing on what "Cowboy" gave him.
"Yeah, we knew that I had 25 minutes to win the fight," they said. "But on my way to the Octagon I talked to my coaches, and they said you have 25 minutes to win the fight, but don't miss an opportunity. If you feel you can connect some hands or some other things, take advantage of it. I think when I threw a body knee on them it was the beginning of the end."

Hi, can you tell us a little bit about yourself (ccg experience, gaming history, etc)?
My name is Drew and I am a small business owner from New Orleans Louisiana. I am a moderator for Scrolls and the founder of The Think Tank. My gaming history is a long and varied one. I started off gaming about 17 years ago playing D&D and Magic The Gathering. For years I was a nationally involved and core member of the official group of Vampire the Masquerade players nationwide. During this time I also played quite a bit of MtG. I played in multiple state tournaments and pro tour qualifiers. My team was the support squad for Tom Ross and helped them get to the point where they are today. I also played L5R, raw deal and warhammer 40k. I've also been known to be a pretty good poker player.
Which precon did you pick and why?
I picked the original order precon. In MtG I enjoyed playing green and blue. I noticed growth but thought that I wanted to try and be a little more technical to start off with so I chose order. Very quickly I switched to growth to really learn the game and now I play order and Decay.
What deck(s) are you running at the moment?
Right now I am running a mono decay aggro deck which is tweaked for the current meta. I also am playing with a few other ideas (as per usual) and would like to run mono order more but with curse and poison being prevalent I find it is often an uphill battle.
Edit: I am now playing a pretty nasty mono order deck. It still needs a bit of tweaking but I think I semi-solved the comeback problem.
How do you feel about the tutorial and the early game?
I feel that the current tutorial is lacking. I am very very happy that the development team is working on a single player campaign along with a more robust tutorial. I hope that they take some direct advice from a few players to help along with this process. The early game is fairly straight forward...a player can advance rather quickly if they play the easy and medium tutorials with a precon deck with a few tweaks. With the money earned there they can advance quite quickly to a respectable 1400-1500 rating and all the while learn the games nuances.
What aspects of Scrolls do you like most?
I love the fact that it isn't just your luck, how you play, or when you play it. It is all of these aspects COMBINED with unit placement and board control.
How do you feel about the current method of trading scrolls?
I feel that anyone can get any scroll in any amount they want, but they must be willing to trade and be patient. I would like for there to be more options for players to collect common scrolls to fill out their collections and get a bargain deck built.
What do you find would restrict Scroll's growth as a CCG?
Lack of advertising. As a business owner I know that in order to grow you must advertise. Word of mouth, good press and grassroots campaigning can only take you so far. If you want a global business you must advertise globally and with great fervor. Granted, Scrolls is still in Beta but there are ways to drum up buzz without breaking the bank and with keeping your game intact. I say start a good advertising campaign after the single player campaign.
What would you change/alter about Scrolls?
I wholeheartedly believe that the future of this game will rely upon it's guilds and tournament scene. I would like to see development support for guilds and for tournaments within the game and not to rely upon a third party system. I think an option for a quicker “chess based” time system with penalties for going over time would help in an advanced / tournament setting to keep it a fun to watch spectator sport
What advice would you give to new players/those lower down the ladder?
1. Keep on pluggin'. Don't give up just because you are on a bad run.
2. Your “super awesome neato” deck may just not be good. Chances are your neat deck has already been tested and deemed unworthy of top tier play.
3. You have to be able to take a step back, learn what the advanced players are doing and copy them. Imitation is a great way to get better and learn the game in a more in depth manner.
4. Do NOT under any circumstances stop trying new things, just don't test them out in ranked if you want to climb higher
5. Learn the current meta and what your good matchups are.
Is there a particular way, a mindset or philosophy, to how you approach the game (i.e. Moves, Competitions, coping with losing streaks, etc)?
I try to have fun. This is a game after all and we play it to take enjoyment from our time.
Just like any other PvP game, when you start losing you have a chance to go on tilt. If this happens you MUST take a step back, calm down and try again once you have a clear head. I can't tell you how many times I've lost an additional 3 games in a row after I should have stopped for the night.
When I play in tournaments I try to tone everything out except for a really good music selection and I try to keep the chat windows to a minimum.
Is there anything in particular that you do for the Scrolls game or community?
My main contribution to the Scrolls community so far has been my involvement with guilds. When I started there were no real active guilds and I had a hard time trying to find people who could help me get better without sacrificing my rating. I decided that I would create a competitive guild and drag all the top players with me to dominate the tournaments. I succeeded in forming a very good team with some amazing players. We had about a 2 month run where a member of The Think Tank won almost every event and the rest placed extremely well. A side effect (actually one I had hoped for) was that we awoke the sleeping beast in The Badger Guild. There were many discussions between Blinky and I about guilds and about our differing strategies. It was a bit dicey at first but now I am glad to say that I have made a damn good friend in Blinky and most of the members of The Badger Guild. The Badgers are at the forefront of the meta and they are also huge supporters of the community. Another side effect of TTT's emergence was that we started a huge renaissance in guild membership. One of my main reasons for starting a guild was to always have friends to play with and bounce ideas off of. These two basic concepts seem to be at the base of all the new guilds core ideals and this makes me very very proud.
My new project is actually creating a live 24/7 Scrolls based radio station. I have some amazing helpers and hopefully this project will be another way for all Scrolls players to share a common communal focal point along with rocking our collective faces off!
Do you have a stream, youtube channel, or website that you'd like people to know about?
I am a common streamer on Scrolls the biggest Twitch channel, The Owl Stream. The Owl Stream is now a community run operation starring the biggest and best Scrolls personalities and players.
http://www.twitch.tv/the_owlstream
This is my guilds Twitch channel. We are planning to start streaming more but we are a very busy guild with a lot of mature players with real lives

Household Economic Survey (Income): Year ended June 2014 – Media Release
Spending on housing is growing at a faster rate than incomes, Statistics New Zealand said today. And people are spending more of their money paying off their mortgage principal, rather than just interest.
The latest Household Economic Survey (Income) shows average annual household income rose 9.1 percent in the two years to June 2014, from $81,227 to $88,579.
In the same period, average household weekly spending on housing costs rose 11.1 percent, from $256 to $284.
“The increase in housing costs was largely due to higher mortgage and rent payments, as well as an increase in property rates," labour market and household manager Diane Ramsay said.
“A really interesting shift we've seen is that a bigger proportion of mortgage spending is going on repaying the principal than on covering the interest payments.”
The average weekly mortgage payment was up from $357 in the year ended June 2012 to $389 in 2014. Average weekly rent payments rose from $273 to $290.
The changes in weekly housing-cost spending and annual household income resulted in an increase in the housing-costs-to-income ratio, which was 16.3 percent for the year ended 30 June 2014. This means that, on average, 16.3 percent of household income was spent on housing costs such as mortgages, rent, rates, and building-related insurance.
The Household Economic Survey (Income) is a shortened version of the three-yearly full Household Economic Survey, and was last done in 2011/12.

D&AD, a British charity group that seeks to promote good design, awarded Apple three top awards at a ceremony held last night. The company earned two prestigious Black Pencils for the iMac and iPhone, as well as a Yellow Pencil for iPod touch in the Product Design category. The Apple Wireless Keyboard and iPod nano were also nominated for product design.
D&AD has offered awards for outstanding design in a yearly design competition throughout its 45-year history. It awards Yellow Pencils based on judging by juries of design professionals in a variety of creative fields, including advertising, architecture, graphic design, film, and photography. Occasionally, Black Pencils are awarded for truly exceptional works, and some years, the organization doesn't award any at all if no work is deemed worthy enough.
Apple took two of these awards home last night, giving the company a total of six Black Pencils earned since 1999. "This makes the multi-national design company the biggest single winner of Black Pencils in D&AD's 45-year history," D&AD said in a statement.
Design has always been at the heart of Apple. Steve Jobs once famously said:
In most people's vocabularies, design means veneer. It's interior decorating. It's the fabric of the curtains or the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a human-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service.
While many have often scoffed at paying an "Apple Tax" for cool design, Mac users know that the care and attention to detail are more than skin deep. This recognition of Apple's hard work should further support the fact that design matters, even in a computer.
Three Blenheim men have been caught trying to sell stolen property back to the people it was stolen from.
Lawson Henare Reihana, 18, Clark Koroheke, 19, and Broghan Wyatt Rakete, 18, obtained two hard drives from an unknown person on March 29, a police summary of facts said.
The hard drives were stolen earlier that day.
They took the hard drives to a house on Warwick St, in Blenheim, where two other men lived, hoping to sell them.

* Marlborough man admits receiving stolen property, possession of cannabis
* Man admits receiving big haul of boat gear
* Burglar's DNA found on fizzy drink can at crime scene
The men recognised the hard drives as stolen from their house and called police.
When spoken to by police, the defendants said they did not steal the hard drives, they just wanted to sell them.
Rakete and Koroheke admitted receiving stolen property at the Blenheim District Court on Monday.
Reihana denied the joint charge and elected a judge alone trial.
Judge Richard Russell said on Monday the maximum penalty for receiving stolen property was seven years' imprisonment.
"Without receivers, there would be fewer burglars and fewer burglaries. You are part of the chain," Judge Russell said.
Rakete was convicted and fined $500, and sentenced to pay $23 in reparation.
Koroheke was convicted and sentenced to 40 hours' community work, and to pay $23 in reparation.
If they were charged with a similar offence in the future, "the gloves will be off, and a tougher outcome will follow," Judge Russell said.
Reihana was remanded on bail to May 30 for a case review hearing.

This blog post introduces the Haskey project, an ACID compliant embedded key-value store entirely written in Haskell, based on an MVCC B+-tree implementation. It was developed as part of the Summer of Haskell 2017. We will take a look at two libraries that we wrote this summer.
Before introducing the libraries, I must say I'm extremely grateful that I got the opportunity to be part of this year's Summer of Haskell. I had really great fun working on this project for the last two months, even though they were incredibly challenging for me, as I had very little experience with the internals of database systems. This is entirely thanks to Steven Keuchel who not only helped me and guided me during the challenging moments, but also made sure we were able to bond outside of the project. Furthermore, I'd like to thank the people who organized SoH 2017, not only because of the opportunities they have created for me, but also because of all the work they have done. I especially want to thank Jasper, who helped me a lot with the necessary paperwork
Disclaimer: Haskey is not production ready yet. We are still actively making changes to the public API and the internals, as well as the binary format.
EDIT (9-Apr-2018): Haskey is now considered stable.
EDIT (9-Apr-2018): Note that this document gives a good overview on how the library is structured, but might use outdated APIs. See this up to date tutorial, which covers a lot of the content in this article, to get started with Haskey.
Haskey's goal and design
The goal of Haskey is to deliver a space efficient, fast and scalable key-value store to the Haskell community, which can be embedded into Haskell projects. To achieve this, we modeled Haskey after LMDB. Our design is based on an MVCC B+-tree, which allows us to provide non-blocking concurrent read access, and serialized write access, where readers and writers do not block each other.
The past two months we have implemented this design, which resulted in two libraries, available on Hackage. The first is haskey-btree, which implements both a copy-in-place and copy-on-write B+-tree. The copy-on-write variant abstracts over an allocator, which is able to write and read B+tree nodes on demand. The second package is called haskey. This package implements such an allocator. It allocates and manages pages to write the nodes to, and it provides transaction support and concurrent access, as well as data integrity. haskey-btree modifies the tree, while haskey supports tree modifications.
The B+-tree implementation
The haskey-btree package includes two separate implementations of B+-trees. The first one can be found in the Data.BTree.Pure module, which contains a pure, standard, textbook implementation of an in-memory B+-tree of a certain minimum degree. It is a standalone implementation, not used anywhere else in the code base, but still a nice thing to have. More interesting, however, is the copy-on-write B+-tree implementation in Data.BTree.Impure.
If we look at some functions in Data.BTree.Impure that are used to modify and query the tree, we notice the following type signatures:
We can see that the functions operate in either the AllocReaderM or the AllocM monad. Let's take a closer look at the definitions of these type classes:
We can see that the AllocReaderM type class supports operations to read B+-tree nodes and overflow values with a certain ID, while the AllocM type class supports operations to write and free B+-tree nodes and overflow values. How do we get such an allocator? Well, the Date.BTree.Alloc.Debug module contains an in-memory allocator based on Data.Map. It is very inefficient, and solely intended for testing and debugging purposes, but it provides a good example on how to start implementing an allocator from scratch.
In the code listing above you can see the debug allocator in action. For a more robust, space efficient and thread-safe allocator we have to turn to the haskey library.
Robust, thread-safe allocator
The haskey library builds upon the haskey-btree library by providing a robust, thread-safe page allocator with transaction support. It allows for multiple concurrent readers which do not block each other, and serialized write access. Furthermore, readers do not block writers, and vice versa.
The actual allocator is implemented in an internal module called Database.Haskey.Alloc.Concurrent.Monad, but you don't really need to know about it. The exported functions in Database.Haskey.Alloc.Concurrent use this monad internally, and they are sufficient to use the allocator. The following functions are particularly interesting:
The openConcurrentDb and createConcurrentDb functions are used to create new and open existing databases. While to transact and the transactReadOnly functions are used to start read-write and read-only transactions.
We can see that to transact and transactReadOnly functions take a function that takes a tree root and can do AllocM and AllocReaderM actions. Exactly what we need to run tree modifications and queries from Data.BTree.Impure! Excellent!
But there is one more catch! We need to run these functions in a ConcurrentMetaStoreM ! Where can we find such a monad?
The storage back-end
Let's take a closer look to the ConcurrentMetaStoreM type class. The functions in the type class aren't all that interesting, but the superclass is! It's the StoreM class:
We can see that the StoreM type class simply abstracts over a storage back-end that can read and write pages and overflow values. There are two built-in storage back-ends. One is the InMemory storage back-end, which we'll let you discover by yourself. The other one is the on-disk store in Database.Haskey.Store.File. Let's look at the interesting functions.
The newFileStore function creates a new uninitialized state for the file storage back-end. This is a simple IORef that can safely be accessed by concurrent threads. Those threads can safely call runFileStoreT with that state.
The runFileStoreT function takes a FileStoreT action. Lucky for us, there is an instance of AllocM and ConcurrentMetaStoreM for FileStoreT ! This allows us to run our beloved transactions.
Full code example
We now have all the pieces to stitch together an example. Let the code do the talking! Example code is also available on GitHub .
It's not hard to see why income inequality and middle class woes are in the spotlight these days.
The numbers tell the story. The richest Americans have seen their fortunes rise in recent decades. Everyone else has either been treading water or falling backwards.
That's in large part because the wealthy have benefited from the soaring stock market and corporate profits. But wages, which the middle class depends on, have stagnated.
This is why President Obama and politicians around the country are looking to give an income boost to the middle class and working Americans. The president wants to give a $500 tax credit to working couples to help them pay for child care or commuting expenses. They outlined their middle class agenda in the State of the Union on Tuesday.
When it comes to income, the wealthy have captured a disproportionate share of the gains in recent decades. While they suffered steeper losses during recessions, they more than made it up during the subsequent recoveries, according to Emmanuel Saez, professor at University of California, Berkeley.
In the most recent recovery, for instance, the income of the Top 1% soared 31.4%. The rest of America saw a miniscule 0.4% increase between 2009 and 2012, according to the most recent data available.

The middle class, meanwhile, has given up all the income gains it enjoyed during the tech boom of the late 1990s and the housing boom of the mid 2000s.
This, along with the lack of growth of average hours earnings in recent years, is one of the main reasons why Americans say they aren't feeling the economic recovery.
Interactive: Here's why the middle class feels squeezed
Wealth has followed a similar pattern. The richest 20% have seen their wealth nearly double over the past 30 years, while the middle class' net worth has ticked up less than 13%, according to Edward Wolff, professor at New York University. The poorest Americans have fallen into debt.
The rich now control 89% of the nation's wealth, up from 81% in 1983. The middle class' share has fallen to 12% from 18%.
(CBS News) In virtually every language in every corner of the world, the first sound a baby makes that can be called a word is MAMMA. In ancient Latin MAMMA became the word for breast - our first source of nurture, comfort and love - and for all humankind a source imagery and medical challenge across the centuries. Our Cover Story is reported now by Tracy Smith:
There are few images in the Christian world more universal and more sacred than these: the Madonna by Leonardo da Vinci, doing what any mother would do: feed their newborn child at their breast.
Since the earliest forms of human expression, the breast (in Latin, Mamma) has been front and center.
Beth Rosenberg, who teaches art history at New York's School of Visual Arts, said breasts have been on artists' minds since the Venus of Willendorf - a statue dating to about 25,000 B.C.
"We see breasts throughout art history because they're about the world, they're about life," Rosenberg said.
More specifically, they're uniquely designed to feed babies.
"Human infants are different from a lot of other mammals in that we don't have this kind of protuberant snout," said science journalist Florence Williams. "And if we had really flat mammary glands and a fat infant trying to suckle that, you know, it would be like kissing a mirror. Doesn't work very well."
Williams, who wrote the book on breasts, says that researchers are still scratching their heads over them.
"It turns out that it's actually a really contentious debate about why breasts evolved," Williams said. "Because breasts, as apart from mammary glands, are very unique in the animal kingdom. They're sort of protuberant from puberty on. And it turns out that's really unusual. Other primates only have breasts while they're breastfeeding."
And since human breasts typically arrive long before they have anything to do, Williams says there is disagreement over whether they evolved for food . . . or sex.
"There's been many decades of scholarship arguing that breasts evolved as sexual signals," they said. "And then the feminist scholars came along in the 1970s and '80s and said, 'Well, wait a minute, maybe they're something to do with how breasts actually work that might help women survive or help infants survive - and maybe the interest in breasts on the part of men came later."
It's a lot more than interest; Dolly Parton was famous for attribute sother than their acting ability . . . .as was Raquel Welch. And who could forget Halle Berry in a bathing suit?
Few people understand this more than Mary Kathryn Langhamer, a veteran bra-fitter at Houston's Top Drawer Lingerie. "Most women really don't like their breasts. There's always something wrong. They're too big or they're too little. They always want the opposite of what they have."
It's no secret that women have been trying to improve on nature for generations. "There were bras that you could put all sorts of things in - wire, tissue, metal. There were even bras that you could blow up with a straw to make your breasts look bigger," said Williams."
In recent years, bigger has often been seen as better. But permanent breast enlargement was a medical puzzle, until a eureka! moment 50 years ago in a Texas blood bank.
"There was a doctor in Houston, Texas, who was holding one of these new silicone blood bags," said Williams. "Blood used to be contained in glass. And they were holding a warm bag of blood and they said, 'My, that feels good. It feels like a breast.'"
Stephen Colbert's “America Again: Re-becoming the Greatness We Never Weren't” is set to be released on October 2nd, 2012.
The book will be published by Grand Central Publishing, and will be available in hardcover, e-book and as an audio book.
“Book store nation, in the history of humankind there has never been a greater country than America. You could say we're the #1 nation at being the best at greatness. But as perfect as America is in every single way, America is broken! And we can't exchange it because we're 236 years past the 30-day return window. Look around–we don't make anything anymore, we've mortgaged our future to China, and the Apologist-in-Chief goes on world tours just to bow before foreign leaders. Worse, the L.A. Four Seasons Hotel doesn't even have a dedicated phone button for the Spa. You have to dial an extension! Where did we lose our way?! It's high time we restored America to the greatness it never lost! Luckily, AMERICA AGAIN will singlebookedly pull this country back from the brink. It features everything from chapters, to page numbers, to fonts. Covering subject's ranging from healthcare (“I shudder to think where we'd be without the wide variety of prescription drugs to treat our maladies, such as think-shuddering”) to the economy (“Life is giving us lemons, and we're shipping them to the Chinese to make our lemon-flavored leadonade”) to food (“Feel free to deep fry this book-it's a rich source of fiber”), Stephen gives America the dose of truth it needs to get back on track.”

“NBC's refusal to drop Trump has put us in the position of dropping $5,000 of cold hard cash to anyone who will yell out ‘Trump is a racist' during the live broadcast of ‘Saturday Night Live,' said Santiago Cejudo, an organizer for the Deport Racism PAC, on Wednesday.
“We're hoping the $5,000 will help people on set or in the studio audience find the bravery to speak out loudly and help focus the national conversation on that we need to deport racism, not people,” they added.
“It's 2016, and Trump needs to hear that you can't win the White House without the brown vote."
Trump is slated to host "Saturday Night Live" on Nov. 7.
Deport Racism also released a profanity-laden video on Wednesday, spoofing Trump's sharp rhetoric on illegal immigration.
The clip features two Hispanic children — “Ricardo” and “Rosa” — cursing the outspoken billionaire's deportation policies.
“F**k you, [you] racist f**k,” Ricardo says to Trump. "If you don't like the Constitution and what it stands for, then get the f**k out of my country.”
Trump's invitation to host “Saturday Night Live” is drawing condemnation from many in the Latino community.
The Congressional Hispanic Caucus said Monday that it opposes NBC's invite and called on the network to drop Trump.
“Mr. Trump's racist remarks and their continued rhetoric demonizing Latinos and immigrants has created fear within these communities around the country, many of which are represented in Congress by members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus,” the 26-member group said in statement.
“[The] Congressional Hispanic Caucus urges NBCUniversal to stand by its earlier commitment to end its relationship with Mr. Trump because the values of ‘respect and dignity for all people' are more important than ratings and ad revenues."
NBC and other businesses severed ties with Trump this summer amid a backlash over their immigration rhetoric.
Trump has repeatedly dismissed criticism from Hispanic groups as political correctness run amok. He's vowing that their “SNL” gig on Saturday will earn NBC record ratings for that time slot.

If you venture into a coffee shop in the coming months and see someone with a pair of futuristic glasses that look like a prop from “Star Trek,” don't worry. It's probably just a Google employee testing the company's new augmented-reality glasses.
On Wednesday, Google gave people a clearer picture of its secret initiative called Project Glass. The glasses are the company's first venture into wearable computing.
The glasses are not yet for sale. Google will, however, be testing them in public.
In a post shared on Google Plus, employees in the company laboratory known as Google X, including Babak Parviz, Steve Lee and Sebastian Thrun, asked people for input about the prototype of Project Glass. Mr. Lee, a Google product manager and originally worked on Google mapping software Latitude, mobile maps and indoor maps, is responsible for the software component and the location-based aspects of the glasses.
“We're sharing this information now because we want to start a conversation and learn from your valuable input,” the three employees wrote. “Please follow along as we share some of our ideas and stories. We'd love to hear yours, too. What would you like to see from Project Glass?”
The prototype version Google showed off on Wednesday looked like a very polished and well-designed pair of wrap-around glasses with a clear display that sits above the eye. The glasses can stream information to the lenses and allow the wearer to send and receive messages through voice commands. There is also a built-in camera to record video and take pictures.
The New York Times first wrote about the glasses in late February, describing an augmented-reality display that would sit over the eye and run on the Android mobile platform.
A video released by Google on Wednesday, which can be seen below, showed potential uses for Project Glass. A man wanders around the streets of New York City, communicating with friends, seeing maps and information, and snapping pictures. It concludes with them video-chatting with a girlfriend as the sun sets over the city. All of this is seen through the augmented-reality glasses.
University of Washington
Project Glass could hypothetically become Project Contact Lens. Mr. Parviz, who is also an associate professor at the University of Washington, specializes in bionanotechnology, which is the fusion of tiny technologies and biology. They most recently built a tiny contact lens that has embedded electronics and can display pixels to a person's eye.
Early reports of the glasses said prototypes could look like a pair of Oakley Thumps — which are clunky and obtrusive sunglasses — but the version Google unveiled Wednesday looks more graceful. There are reportedly dozens of other shapes and variations of the glasses in the works, some of which can sit over a person's normal eyeglasses.
People I have spoken with who have have seen Project Glass said there is a misconception that the glasses will interfere with people's daily life too much, constantly streaming information to them and distracting from the real world. But these people said the glasses actually free people up from technology.
One person who had used the glasses said: “They let technology get out of your way. If I want to take a picture I don't have to reach into my pocket and take out my phone; I just press a button at the top of the glasses and that's it.”
Project Glass is one of many projects currently being built inside the Google X offices, a secretive laboratory near Google's main Mountain View, Calif., campus where engineers and scientists are also working on robots and space elevators.
As I kid, one of my favorite treats was an orange shaped chocolate candy that my mom would pick up from the drug store. The chocolate orange pulled apart in sections and had an amazing bitter orange and dark chocolate blast of flavor. I love reflecting on the flavors of my childhood that made my taste buds happy and this roasty toasty Porter is packed with chocolate richness and bitter orange.
Traditional Porter originated in London around 1700 and was one of the first industrialized beers along with the stronger "Stout" style. You will find year-round production of Porter in the US, England and Baltic regions, especially in cooler parts of the season.
The flavor has a creamy roasty-toasty malt and can be fully hopped or not. The aroma is of roasty malt and traditionally has no hop aroma. The balance of malt and hops is level with roast in various proportions. Porters are great with roasted/smoked foods like BBQ, sausages, roasted meats and even chocolate chips.
The normal gravity range for a Porter is 1.040 -1.060 with an ABV range of 4.5 - 6.5%. Bitterness is low to medium on this beer around 20-40 IBUs with color 30-50L (brown to black) and attenuation/body is medium.

A federal judge in San Francisco, California has refused to reinstate President Donald Trump's executive order that seeks to get state local law enforcement to cooperate with federal authorities on undocumented immigrants.
The US Department of Justice had asked District Court Judge William Orrick to reverse their own April injunction against Trump's executive order. The judge refused to do so, effectively blocking the enforcement of the order across the country.
The Trump administration said it would slash federal aid to jurisdictions which did not comply with federal law (8 U.S.C. 1373 ) which prohibits local and state governments from enacting laws or policies which limits communication with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) about “information regarding the immigration or citizenship status” of individuals.

Orrick decided that the threat to withhold federal funds from cities which did not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement could be unconstitutional.
In May, the Department of Justice issued a memo clarifying that cities that “willfully refuse to comply” with federal law could lose grants from the Justice and Homeland Security departments, but not other federal funding.
However, Orrick said they found the DOJ's memo unconvincing, as it would allow the US attorney general to reverse their stand at any moment.
Meanwhile, Attorney General Jeff Sessions was in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Friday, pushing for cooperation between law enforcement at federal, state and local levels.
“Unfortunately, this cooperation has been impeded by the policies of some cities and states. Some jurisdictions in this country refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities and turn over illegal aliens who commit crimes,” Sessions told police officers.
Officials in the City of Brotherly Love said local law enforcement will not act as immigration agents ‒ a position Sessions has challenged as unconstitutional.
“I am especially saddened for the residents of Philadelphia who have been victimized as a result of these policies,” they continued.
The attorney general cited several crimes involving illegal immigrants in the city. Sessions cited a case of an illegal immigrant who was supposed to be deported in 2015, but because of Philadelphia's policies, prevented local law enforcement from carrying out ICE's detainer request. “He was released, and in August of last year, they were charged with raping a child,” Sessions said.

The DOJ chief urged the city of Philadelphia and every “sanctuary” jurisdiction “to consider carefully the harm they are doing to their residents by refusing to cooperate with federal law enforcement and to re-think these policies.”
Enforcing Trump's policy on sanctuary cities has proved a tough challenge for the DOJ in at least 10 jurisdictions across the country.
In California, the State Assembly's Judiciary Committee recently approved legislation that, if signed into law, would protect undocumented immigrants in the Golden State by severely limiting cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities.
“ICE is out to arrest and deport honest, hard-working parents who obey the laws and pay their taxes and owe allegiance to the red, white and blue,” said state Senate leader Kevin de Leon, who introduced the measure.
The Los Angeles Police Department supports the proposed legislation, saying LAPD officers need the immigrant community's trust to effectively investigate crimes by ensuring witnesses and victims will not be arrested and deported for cooperating with law enforcement.
On Wednesday, ICE's acting chief Thomas Homan said they planned to crack down on what they termed “ludicrous” sanctuary cities, and praised Trump for “taking the handcuffs off law enforcement,” in interview with the Washington Examiner.
They also plan to add 10,000 more agents to the force. Under Trump, illegal border crossings have decreased 70 percent and arrests in the US have increased 40 percent, according to Homan.
The most reliable US rocket company, United Launch Alliance, could not compete with upstart provider SpaceX during a competition in late 2015 for an Air Force payload, a senior engineer with the company said Wednesday. SpaceX was able to offer launch capabilities for as little as one-third the price of what United Launch Alliance could, said Brett Tobey, vice president of engineering for the Colorado-based rocket company.
It does not appear Tobey knew their remarks at a University of Colorado-Boulder seminar were being recorded. But Space News obtained a copy of the audio and posted the revealing, nearly hour-long recording on its website. By Wednesday night Reuters reported that Tobey had resigned from their position at United Launch Alliance, effective immediately.
"The views, positions, and inaccurate statements Mr. Tobey presented at their recent speaking engagement were not aligned with the direction of the company, my views, nor the views I expect from ULA leaders," the company's chief executive, Tory Bruno, said in a statement. Tobey's comments are likely to undermine the efforts of Bruno, who has received kudos within the US spaceflight community for trying to make ULA more competitive and innovative.
The 10-year-old company has a sterling record of more than 100 launches with a perfect success rate. However, its workhorse rocket, the Atlas V, has faced criticism because it is powered by Russian RD-180 engines; some in Congress are no longer comfortable with the US military relying on Russian technology to get its sensitive national security payloads into space.
The company has also come under price pressure from SpaceX, which offers lower rates for its Falcon 9 rocket. Late last year, after the military had certified the Falcon 9 as reliable and safe enough for national security launches, the Air Force asked for bids to launch a GPS 3 satellite in 2018. When ULA did not bid on the contract, effectively ceding it to SpaceX, Bruno said their company was “unable to submit a compliant proposal” because of contract requirements and the limitations Congress had imposed on the RD-180 engine.
Cost shootout
However, during their remarks Wednesday, Tobey offered a sharply different view of that contract. "ULA opted to not bid that," they said. "The government was not happy with us not bidding that contract because they felt that they had bent over backwards to lean the fill to our advantage. But... we saw it as a cost shootout between us and SpaceX. So now we're going to have to figure out how to bid these things at a much lower cost. And the government can't just say ULA has a great track record, they've done 105 launches in a row with 100 percent mission success, and we can give it to them on a silver platter even though their costs are two or three times as high."
As far as those costs, Tobey said SpaceX was able to offer launch services as low as $60 million per flight, whereas the lowest ULA could offer was $125 million. However, they added, that did not include an $800 million "capability contract" that the military pays ULA annually to guarantee readiness and the ability to essentially launch on demand. If you factor in these funds, which SpaceX does not receive, the lowest cost launches that ULA can offer are about $200 million.
During their talk Tobey said they were recruited to address the issue of cost competitiveness within the ranks of about 1,500 engineers at ULA, which is a joint venture between two of America's largest aerospace contractors, Boeing and Lockheed Martin. "What I was hired to do last summer is to lead this transformation of ULA's work force from where it was into the future," they said. They predicted there would be a lot of "chaos" going forward as ULA adjusts to these changes necessitated by lower-cost bidding. That may be an understatement after the public release of their remarks.
Congressional brouhaha
Tobey also addressed the simmering debate in Congress over whether ULA should be allowed to continue to use the RD-180 engine. The battle has played out in the Senate between Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who is chairperson of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, and Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), who is chairperson of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over NASA's budget. McCain is an ally of SpaceX, and they say for the sake of national defense the country cannot rely on Russian-made engines. Shelby is from Alabama, where ULA has a large rocket manufacturing facility.
In December, after McCain had instituted a ban on the use of RD-180 engines after 2019, Shelby effectively lifted that restriction in the final writing of the omnibus budget bill. McCain was, and remains, irate over this maneuver. Tobey said this was done at the behest of SpaceX founder Elon Musk.
"There's a couple people, this guy in particular, John McCain, who basically doesn't like us," Tobey said of ULA. "He's like this with Elon Musk. So Elon Musk says why don't you go after United Launch Alliance to see if you can get that engine outlawed." At this point Tobey said a friend of ULA, Shelby, intervened. "He basically at the last minute, in December of last year, when they were doing the omnibus bill to keep the government running, they parachuted in in the middle of the night and added some language into the authorization bill to ignore McCain's language and allow United Launch Alliance to use any engine."
It is not clear what ramifications Tobey's comments might have both in Congress and at the headquarters of SpaceX, which has long maintained it can offer similar services to ULA at a far lower cost.
Back in April, 2014, when SpaceX was trying to break into the national security payload launch market, Musk accused the US government of entering into improper and uncompetitive launch agreements with private contractors and said SpaceX's rockets could do the same job for much less. “We're just protesting and saying these launches should be competed," said Musk at a press conference. "And if we compete and lose, that's fine, but why were they not even competed?" That suit was resolved last year after the Air Force certified the Falcon 9 rocket.
Bubba Smith, the former NFL star and "Police Academy" movie actor, appears to have died of natural causes, but authorities said an autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause of death.
Police said there were no signs of foul play at Smith's Baldwin Hills home, where they were found dead Wednesday afternoon. They were 66.
Their caretaker discovered the body and called police.

The autopsy will be performed later this week, but coroner's officials did not immediately say when. It's routine for the coroner to conduct autopsies when a doctor does not sign a death certificate, which is what happened in Smith's case, authorities said.
Smith was a 6-foot-7 National Football League defensive end and tackle for the Baltimore Colts, Oakland Raiders and Houston Oilers.
Climate change is real and unfolding, and the outlook for California is bleak, according to new state-sponsored studies.
Released Tuesday, the studies warn that California can expect more scorching heat waves, severe wildfires and strain on the electric grid as the Earth warms and sea levels rise along the state's 1,100-mile long coast.
Higher temperatures in the coming decade mean that many more of the state's 37 million people will depend on air conditioning — increasing demand for electricity by up to 1 gigawatt during hot summer months. One gigawatt is roughly the size of two coal-fired power plants and is enough energy to power 750,000 homes.
“The demand for electricity will increase as households operate existing air conditioners more frequently, and in many regions will install air conditioners where there currently are few,” says a report on residential electricity demand by Max Auffhammer of UC Berleley. The study found that inland ZIP codes with a higher share of low-income and Latino residents are likely to experience larger increases in electricity consumption.”
The California Natural Resources Agency and the California Energy Commission jointly released the series of peer-reviewed scientific studies, titled “Our Changing Climate 2012,” to help the state prepare for and adapt to the changes, many of which are already underway.
California is experiencing more rain and less snow, and the snow that does fall in the Sierra Nevada is melting sooner in the spring. California currently gets about 15 percent of its electricity from hydropower, but hydropower generation is declining due to reduced snow pack, earlier runoff and higher rates of evaporation
The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta helps provide fresh water to two-thirds of the state's residents, but rising sea levels are putting pressure on the Delta's system of earthen levees. One of the studies found that the entire Delta region may be sinking, which may cause levees to fall below safety design thresholds as early as 2050.
More than 25 research teams from the University of California and other academic institutions produced the 34 studies on topics ranging from the impact of storms and rising seas on Bay Area airports and the Port of Oakland to vulnerability of the agriculture industry in Fresno County and long-term wildfire risk.
“We accept that cigarette smoking causes cancer, and we accept that HIV causes AIDS,” Ken Alex, a senior policy adviser to Gov. Jerry Brown, said at a morning news conference in Mather. “We are not in the same place with climate change. … Here in California, we do make policy decisions based on the science. Governor Brown actually reads the science, and they take it very seriously. I know at a deeply personal level that they want to do something about climate change, and they want to see California take a leadership role. This set of reports does not paint a rosy picture.”
Ken Pimlott, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said firefighters know the impacts of climate change from fighting more frequent and intense wildfires on the ground.
“These are not changes we're talking about in the future — these changes are occurring now,” said Pimlott. “We're already seeing longer fire seasons — on average, two months longer in many areas of the state. In Southern California, we're seeing fire seasons that can last year round, even in what are usually the wet months of January and February.”
Pimlott said 11 of the state's 20 largest most destructive fires have occurred since 2002.
“We're seeing a rapid increase in the number of large, damaging fires,” they said. “Something is changing. …We need to get ahead of the fires before they occur. Public education is key.”
Electric transmission corridors in the state, including the line that brings hydropower from the Pacific Northwest into California, also are vulnerable to wildfires.
Nationally, the debate on climate change shifted last weekend when Richard Muller, who had been a leading skeptic of global warming, wrote an op-ed in The New York Times concluding that global warming is real and that “Humans are almost entirely the cause.” Muller, a physics professor at UC﻿ Berkeley, now characterizes themselves as a “converted skeptic.”
Brown has long been one of the most outspoken politicians on the issue of climate change, and California is moving forward with efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and boost its use of renewable electricity.
“We are looking at climate change and what we have to do to adapt,” said John Laird, Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency. “We have to get Californians at every level of government and individually to think about this.”

Russia reportedly wants almost 1.2 billion euros in compensation, if France cancels a contract to deliver two Mistral helicopter carriers.
President Francois Hollande is under pressure from Western allies to scrap the deal because of Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis.
According to the Russian daily, Kommersant, Paris is offering around 785 million euros.
The Kremlin says its position is clear: either France stumps up the full compensation, or it hands over the warships.
It is claimed that Paris is keen to resell the two Mistrals before paying out compensation.
But a Russian defence official has said the vessels cannot go to a third country because they've been tailor made and it is a matter of state security.
While it seems a storm is brewing at sea, the Kremlin has emphasised there is no threat to relations with France.
Toronto Argos defensive end Ricky Foley is "sick" of the attention the Maple Leafs and Raptors get, while the city treats their league, the Canadian Football League, like "poo," the player tweeted on Wednesday.
Foley was irate after the Toronto Maple Leafs announced a new coach on the same day the Argos announced a new stadium and owner.
They chalked up the Leafs publicity move as "jealousy" that the Argos have a winning record.
They also took aim at the NBA's Toronto Raptors, saying their logo "We The North" does not represent the team, since many of its players return to the United States in the off-season.
Foley's tweets can be read below. Some are mildly profane.

Immigration website takes strain as thousands of Americans explore their options away from a country that will be led by Donald Trump
Move to New Zealand? US migration inquiries rise 24-fold after election day
The election of Donald Trump as America's next president has sent shockwaves around the globe – and resulted in a rush of interest from Americans in emigrating to New Zealand.
In the past 24 hours, the website of Immigration New Zealand (INZ) received 56,300 visits from the US – a huge rise on its daily average of 2,300. Within the same period, more than 7,000 Americans registered interest in moving to New Zealand, which is more than double the monthly average.
Electing Trump: the moment America laid waste to democracy as we know it Read more
Similar spikes of interest in New Zealand were noted by INZ from Britons in the months after Brexit, with New Zealand seen as an ideal resettlement nation due to its shared cultural history with Britain.
The New Zealand Now website – which contains detailed information on living, working, studying and investing in New Zealand – received 70,500 visits from the US in the past 24 hours, or 69,000 more than its daily average.
The surge in interest from Americans in moving to New Zealand began a month before the US presidential election, with twice the level of activity seen compared with a year before.
New Zealand has already seen its highest levels of immigration on record in 2016, and Kiwis were quick to take to Twitter and jokingly defend their borders.
Taika Waititi (@TaikaWaititi) Don't even think about moving to New Zealand. You shat the bed, now you have to deal with the mess.

Mount Katahdin is the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail
By Simon Winchester
Massachusetts
In 1937, the Appalachian Trail was opened, running from the southern US state of Georgia to Maine in the north. In future, could it be extended to Europe and even Africa? Not far from where I live - deep in the hills of western Massachusetts - runs the famous Appalachian Trail, the 2175-mile (3500km) walking trail, getting on for a century old, and of which American east-coasters are understandably proud. We see it when we drive to our local grocery store, where the trail crosses Route 23. An arrow pointing left says simply, "Georgia" and to the right, "Maine", and in each direction the tiny pathway snakes off into the woods, in just a moment vanishing among the trees. This is the time of year when we see people on the trail - bearded young men alone, or young couples staggering under giant rucksacks, heading north. The IAT plan is the brainchild of fisheries biologist Dick Anderson These are the famous "thru-walkers", tough and ambitious types with five or six months on their hands, who decided to begin their walk among the early dogwoods down in Georgia last March, and who hope to get to Mount Katahdin in Maine by October, before the first snows fall. Occasionally we meet them hitch-hiking - people who have decided to break off for a few hours, to get a shower in a local motel, buy some more granola bars or just call home. Rite of passage Generally you do not pick up hitch-hikers in America these days, but with thru-walkers, we always give them a ride. They have such tales to tell: sometimes of encounters with black bears back in Tennessee, or terrific storms on the ridges of West Virginia, or learning how to spot poison ivy, or what it was like to cross the Hudson on that vertiginous old bridge. Why not... persuade people with strong thighs and a very great deal of time on their hands to stroll all the way from Georgia to the Atlas Mountains, north of the Sahara?
Most are young, and you know that, for them, "doing the AT" - as they call it - really is a rite of passage. And now there are plans to extend the track. I meet the planners of this new "international" AT - most of them geologists - at a gathering beside an ice-cold lake in northern Maine. Their plans are nothing if not ambitious. They want to take the trail not just over the Canadian border and into Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and up to the tip of Newfoundland. They also want it to go all around the North Atlantic Ocean. They insist it makes good geological sense. The forces that threw up the Appalachian chain 350 million years ago also formed mountains across North Africa, back when there was no Atlantic Ocean, when the continents were all one - the Pangaea supercontinent - and they were linked together. So why not link them up again, by extending the walking trail and persuade people with strong thighs and a very great deal of time on their hands to stroll all the way from Georgia to the Atlas Mountains, north of the Sahara? Blazing a trail The idea, mind-bogglingly mad though it sounds, appears to be catching on. Greenland has said it will cut a short trail across its ice-free southern tip. Iceland too, and the Faroe Islands. Could American hikers one day finish their rite of passage in Scotland? There has been a communication from the people who administer the West Highland Way in Scotland to say they will probably get on board, agreeing to mark their trail with the little green AT triangles that are so familiar to us here, and painting white or blue markers, known as blazes, on trees (the origin of the phrase "blazing a trail"). The Isle of Man walking community is saying they want a piece of the action. In Ireland, walkers are full of enthusiasm. In western France, and in Galicia - where there's already a famous walk to Santiago de Compostela - and down in the cork forest of southern Spain, there is interest. And from there it is just a short hop across to Africa, and the hills of Morocco. The Berbers have been very accommodating, say the people in Maine, and especially the geologists in Casablanca. Small problem All this talk is going on in the brooding shadow of Mt Katahdin in Maine, while it still has cornices of late snow on its upper cliffs. Maps are brought out, routes planned, pictures swapped. I tell the chief planner how I liked seeing the thru-walkers crossing Route 23 back near home, with the sign pointing to Georgia one way, and that maybe it would soon say Morocco instead of Maine. But then I ask: "What about the sea?" "Ah, yes", they replied. "The sea. A bit of a problem, true, but we'll manage. Got to have the vision first. That's just a detail. "You'll see Morocco on the signboard soon, I guarantee. And you know, they have just as much snow there as we do here in Maine. "Same rocks, same snow. It all makes such good sense."

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has seen its influence and power expand under President Trump, whose efforts to bolster border security and crack down on illegal immigration have run through the youngest federal department.
Homeland Security, established just 15 years ago after the Sept. 11 attacks, has enjoyed greater visibility and influence as Trump has pledged to establish “law and order” and build a wall at the southern border.
The department has been given the lead on implementing Trump's most controversial and prominent policy moves, including the president's executive orders barring certain travelers from entering the country.

Homeland Security agents have also cracked down on illegal immigration and so-called sanctuary cities, arresting nearly 500 undocumented immigrants in areas refusing to comply with Trump's deportation efforts last month.
Trump's first Homeland Security secretary, John Kelly John Francis KellyMORE, is now the White House chief of staff, while Kelly's deputy, Kirstjen Nielsen, has been nominated to succeed them at DHS.
Former department officials in both parties say it's no surprise that Homeland Security's power has grown under Trump, but they see it as remarkable nonetheless.
“The administration's priorities overlap with the department's missions pretty aggressively,” said Stewart Verdery, a former DHS assistant secretary of policy during the George W. Bush administration.
“It should be no surprise that DHS is front and center of their priorities, and the fact that Kelly has switched jobs now kind of doubles down on that.”
Kelly, a former commander of U.S. Southern Command and a crusader against illegal drug trafficking, is now a key member of Trump's inner circle at the White House. Michael Chertoff, a former Homeland Security secretary under George W. Bush, said this naturally should give their former department added insight and clout.
“You now have somebody in a critical job in the White House who really understands Homeland Security from the inside out and not just from the outside in,” they said. “I think from DHS's standpoint, it's very good to have someone who had been secretary in the position that John Kelly is in the White House.”
Trump has sought to bolster resources for Homeland Security, particularly for its Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, while signaling the need for deep cuts at other agencies and departments. Overall, Trump's budget proposal boosted Homeland Security funding by $2.8 billion, which included funds for the border wall as well as millions to hire more CBP and ICE officers.
Critics say that the expansion of Homeland Security's power has come at the expense of other agencies, including the State Department, which saw its budget gutted by a third in Trump's proposal.
“The State Department has been basically castrated,” said Todd Rosenblum, who served as DHS deputy undersecretary during the Obama administration. “A lot of the issues that State would normally be handling on immigration assessments in terms of overseas issues and how much they impact U.S. foreign policy, that seems to be really pushed aside with this great emphasis just on the security side of that equation.”
While deportations increased at the start of the Obama administration, the last president focused efforts on undocumented immigrants who had committed other crimes, not those who had entered the country illegally purely for economic reasons.
“I think they viewed the DHS role as one of calibrating, getting to a place where we acknowledge, accept and absorb the immigrants into the country, those who are here illegally, sort of resolve the issue,” Rosenblum said.
The Trump administration considered moving State's bureau of Consular Affairs and its bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration to Homeland Security. However, a State Department official recently told Congress that the move was no longer under consideration, amid mounting opposition to the department's reorganization proposals on Capitol Hill.
The State Department was also seen as having more pull under the Obama administration, spearheading negotiations on the Iran nuclear deal and other international pacts.
Rosenblum said DHS's gains in power have largely come at the expense of State.
“Because State is so diminished at the table, it definitely has increased the place of DHS,” said Rosenblum, now a national security expert at the Atlantic Council.
Trump's bond with Kelly has stood in stark contrast to their relationship with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson Rex Wayne TillersonHeather Nauert withdraws their name from consideration for UN ambassador job Trump administration's top European diplomat to resign in February Pompeo planning to meet with Pat Roberts amid 2020 Senate speculation MORE, who has scuffled with the White House over appointments and has been publicly undermined by Trump for their strategy on North Korea.
Kelly's influence with the president was cemented by Trump's recent decision to nominate Nielsen, the retired Marine general's deputy, to replace them at Homeland Security. The ties they have cultivated with both Trump and Kelly also likely guarantee that the department will maintain its standing in the new administration.
Nielsen is widely cheered in Republican circles for their experience, which includes prior service at Homeland Security.
Since its creation, the Homeland Security Department has evolved into a sprawling agency that must contend with increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, threats from domestic terrorism and natural disasters. As threats have compounded, the department has seen its powers grow.
Homeland Security is not absent of challenges going forward.
Some critical positions remain open at the department, including the undersecretary that oversees the cybersecurity of federal civilian networks and critical infrastructure.
Indeed, the department has existed for three months without a permanent leader as successive hurricanes have challenged Homeland Security's disaster response efforts.
“Are there issues? Yes. I think issues are really at the management level,” said James Carafano, a national security expert at the Heritage Foundation who served on the Trump transition team. “They haven't had their rollout of the senior political people and you really need those people to make those changes.”
Some also say that the new administration has been too focused on building “the wall” and has neglected less politically charged issues, including long-term budget and operational plans.
“The reality is we just don't have a long-term, specific plan that includes money and funding and staff,” said James Norton, a cybersecurity expert and former Bush-era DHS official. “At the end of the day, it's all about funding and budgets.”
Still, former officials observe the department's maturation through five successive secretaries and three presidential administrations, which they expect to continue as Nielsen takes on the top role.
“I think it has matured over time. I think each successive secretary has been able to mature the department,” Chertoff said. “I think that particularly in the area of cyber, DHS is taking a bigger and more operational role. I think it's been progressing along.”
A Democratic member of congress has proposed convening a special committee of psychiatrists and other doctors whose job would be to determine if President Donald Trump is fit to serve in the Oval Office.
Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, who also teaches constitutional law at American University, has predictably failed to attract any Republicans to their banner.
But the U.S. Constitution's 25th Amendment does allow for a majority of the president's cabinet, or 'such other body as Congress may by law provide,' to decide if an Oval Office occupant is unable to carry out their duties – and then to put it to a full congressional vote.
Vice President Mike Pence would also have to agree, which could slow down the process – or speed it up if they wanted the levers of power for himself.
The 25th Amendment has been around since shortly after the John F. Kennedy assassination, but Congress has never formed its own committee in case it's needed to judge a president's mental health.
Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin has a plan that would allow Congress to name a commission with the power to determine if President Donald Trump is too mentally ill to hold office
Trump, shown leaving Washington on Friday with first lady Melania and their son Barron, could be removed from office at the end of a long process – but only if they were unable to make or communicate their decisions to Congress and their cabinet
Raskin's bill would allow the four Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate to each choose a psychiatrist and another doctor. Then each party would add a former statesman – like a retired president or vice president.
The final group of 10 would meet and choose an 11th member, who would become the committee's chairperson.
Once the group is officially seated, the House and Senate could direct it through a joint resolution to conduct an actual examination of the president 'to determine whether the president is incapacitated, either mentally or physically,' according to the Raskin bill.
And if the president refuses to participate, the bill dictates, that 'shall be taken into consideration by the commission in reaching a conclusion.'
Under the 25th Amendment, such a committee – or the president's cabinet – can notify Congress in writing that a sitting president is unfit. In either case the vice president must concur, and they would immediately become 'acting president.'
Presidents have voluntarily transferred their powers to vice presidents in the past, including when they are put under anesthesia for medical procedures.
Raskin, a constitutional law professor as well as a legislator, has mad no bones about the fact that their House bill is an attack on Trump specifically
In the case of Raskin's plan, the Constitution holds that both houses of Congress would hold a vote within three weeks.
If two-thirds majorities in the House and Senate agreed that the president couldn't discharge their duties, they would be dismissed.
Raskin's plan could have a fatal flaw, however: Legal scholars tend to agree that when the Constitution's framers first provided for the replacement of a president with an 'inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the Office,' they weren't talking about mere eccentricities.
And when the 25th Amendment was sent to the states for ratification in 1965, the Senate agreed that 'inability' meant that a president was 'unable to make or communicate their decisions' and suffered from a 'mental debility' rendering them 'unable or unwilling to make any rational decision.'
So far two dozen members of the House, all Democrats, have signed on to cosponsor the bill.
Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a far-left liberal Democrat, claimed Friday in a Fox Business Channel interview that Congress can remove 'incompetent' presidents.
'The 25th Amendment is utilized when a president is perceived to be incompetent or unable to do their or their job,' they said.
According to the 25th Amendment, whether it's the cabinet or a congressional commission that might decide Trump is unfit to serve, Vice President Mike Pence must agree or the process stops dead in its tracks
Raskin has made no bones about the fact that their intentions are specific to President Trump.
'Trump's mental incapacity is no laughing matter,' they tweeted last month. '#25thAmendment gives us a way to deal with this problem.'
Raskin summed up their reasoning for Yahoo News on Friday: 'In case of emergency, break glass.'
'I assume every human being is allowed one or two errant and seemingly deranged tweets,' they said.
'The question is whether you have a sustained pattern of behavior that indicates something is seriously wrong.'
Also on Friday, MSNBC co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski authored an op-ed in The Washington Post whose headline argued 'Donald Trump is not well.'
The pair were responding to a widely criticized tweet in which Trump complained about their behavoior around the New Year and alleged that Brzezinski was bleeding from a bad facelift.
During a press conference on Thursday, Raskin called Trump a 'barbarian' and said: 'Something is deeply wrong at the White House.'
They called on 'whoever is in control over there' to 'pull back from this terrible situation.'
Tim Ferriss is a self-made lab rat. The author and entrepreneur has been subjecting themselves to audacious experiments in physical training and nutrition since high school. In perhaps the most extreme undertaking, they packed on 34 pounds of muscle while dropping 3 pounds of fat in 28 days. They recount their adventures in a new book, The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman , a title they reverse-engineered from data they collected from the clickstream and Twitterverse.
The book is a sequel of sorts to their first book, The 4-Hour Workweek . Aimed at young men curious about wealth, leisure, and foreign travel, Workweek was rejected by some 26 publishers before Crown took a chance on it. Its viral mix of anything-is-possible enthusiasm and practical productivity tips turned out to be the formula for a publishing phenomenon—it's still riding best-seller lists more than three years after it hit bookstores.
Now, in The 4-Hour Body , Ferriss, 33, turns to an entirely different set of keywords: weight loss, muscle gain, sperm count, and female orgasm. Wired asked contributing editor Gary Wolf—cofounder of the Quantified Self, a blog about self-tracking and self-experimentation—to interrogate Ferriss about their history as an n-of-1 guinea pig, their experience with performance-enhancing drugs, and their faith in heretical recipes for radical self-improvement.
Wired: When did you start experimenting on yourself?
Tim Ferriss: When I was a competitive wrestler in high school, I was prone to overheating. So I had to find ways to dissipate heat. Manipulating hydration was really my starting point.
Wired: Did you diet a lot?
Ferriss: In my senior year, I cut from between 175 and 178 to 152 twice a week. I did it by pure dehydration. You have to be careful with that, because you can have organs fail if you go about it the wrong way. I don't recommend it.
Wired: How did you learn about these dark arts? I mean, you're a teenage wrestler. Did your coach clue you in?
Ferriss: No, my only help came from other wrestlers who themselves had tested the methods of previous wrestlers. When you have good data, such as pound-per-hour loss rates, you can learn quickly through trial and error. I also read a lot about electrolyte balance. I wanted to find out what was just below the threshold of life-threatening.
Wired: How far did you take it?
Ferriss: By the time I was 21, I had refined the approach, and I was using diuretics as well. I cut about 20 pounds to compete in the kickboxing nationals; then, after weighing in, I hyper-hydrated. I weighed in at 165, and the next day I stepped onto the platform at 193. It was pretty funny. My first opponent stepped onto the mat and started looking around because they thought they were on the wrong platform. They were like, this can't be right! I won a gold medal.
Wired: Diuretics aren't banned?
Ferriss: Yes, in many cases they are. Not only because of their weight-loss effects but also because they can mask other drugs. In any event, at the higher levels of athletics this sort of thing is the rule rather than the exception. In any sport where power, speed, or endurance is a determining factor, everyone is using drugs.
Wired: You got your start with this stuff in the '90s, just as the shadow world of performance-enhancing drugs seemed to be hitting the mainstream. It looks like you were able to stand on the border of those two worlds.
Ferriss: There are a lot of things that can be learned from the darker corners of athletics. You have doctors who view bodybuilders as cavalier amateurs of science. And then you have the bodybuilders who view the doctors as too conservative to do anything interesting. So I've tried to become the middleman for putting some of those pieces together.
Wired: Aside from the diuretics, what were you into in those days?
Ferriss: The cocktail that I began experimenting with was ephedrine plus caffeine plus aspirin. Basically, you're hitting the accelerator.
Wired: These are all over-the-counter drugs.
Ferriss: Ephedrine was for a long time. But people were using it to manufacture methamphetamine, so they started blending it with other drugs to make that harder to do. But I don't recommend it anyway. There's an entire generation of male strength and endurance athletes, even recreational lifters, who have never gotten off the ephedrine-caffeine-aspirin stack. The process of getting off stimulants is really horrible. I'm more cautious now. Hey, um [pulling a bottle of pills and a plastic pouch of fine powder from a paper bag], I brought you some goodies. I don't know what the law is governing these, so let's say I'm giving them to you for visual reference only.
Wired: OK, right.
Ferriss: God knows I don't want to be accused of “intent to distribute.”
In the Lab With
Tim Ferriss The 4-Hour Body is a lab report on more than a decade of diet, exercise, and sexual trials that Tim Ferriss carried out on himself. Here are some highlights.
—Angela Watercutter
To test the effect of cholesterol consumption on their lipid profile, Ferriss adopted a diet that provided almost 100 percent of their calories from beef and mixed nuts for three weeks. Eating 2 to 4 pounds of grass-fed meat per day. The meat-and-nut “reverse cleanse” reduced their cholesterol levels. It also helped triple their testosterone level. To prove that the food they ate could be turned into muscle instead of fat, they spent 28 days trying to put on as much muscle mass as possible (without using steroids). Methodically measuring their feces volume to test how well their nutritional supplements were working. Ferriss gained 34 pounds of lean muscle and lost 3 pounds of flab in four weeks, dropping their total body fat percentage from 16.72 to 12.23. To determine which meals were likely to add body fat and to assess the optimal timing for food intake around athletic activities, they had a device implanted in their side that tracked their blood glucose for three to four weeks. The protruding sensor made it hard to shower. They also had to prick their fingers 20 to 30 times a day to draw blood for parallel tests to verify the device's output. Lots of nutritional insight. For example, it's best to have a “post-workout” shake 20 minutes before hitting the gym. To see if they could undo their athletic injuries of the previous 13 years—effectively restoring their body to that of a 20-year-old—in part by injecting a cocktail of their own refined blood, insulin-like growth factor 1, and stem cell growth factors flown in from Israel. A “stupid and completely avoidable” staph infection in their elbow, caused by a botched injection, that required emergency surgery. It took longer than expected, but after six months, they actually reversed the effects of all their major injuries. Most of the benefit came from physical therapy, not drugs. To find a precise and replicable method for generating orgasms in women, they enlisted the help of tantric specialists, “sex commune” instructors, and porn stars, among others. Finding enough willing subjects to adequately test their hypotheses. After much diligent fieldwork, they hit on a technique capable of producing orgasms lasting up to 15 minutes. They say that it's effective more than 95 percent of the time.
Wired: [Examining the bottle.] Good old piracetam. I wrote about these so-called smart drugs in the early '90s. I'm still skeptical.
Ferriss: The pouch is micronized resveratrol, which you can't buy over the counter.
Wired: Where did you get it?
Ferriss: I got it directly from the manufacturer. Resveratrol is fascinating stuff. One of the best sources of information about it is the Immortality Institute. They have a forum where some people are in the 500 Club, as they call it. They've been taking 500 milligrams for years. It's a really great source of data.
Wired: Do you take it?
Ferriss: Not anymore. There are anecdotal reports of joint pain, and I ended up having incredible pain in my elbows and lesser pain in my knees.
Wired: What do you think is the most dangerous experiment that you tried for The 4-Hour Body ?
Ferriss: I had a chemical cocktail injected to reverse injuries. It included BMP, bone morphogenetic protein, and there's a risk of it fusing your vertebrae. In retrospect, I probably wouldn't have included that.
Wired: There's a long section on sexual performance in the new book, where you get hands-on instruction on what you call “facilitating” female orgasm. Why did you want to include this?
Ferriss: This book is entirely a product of polling and asking people what they want to learn about. When you try to find out about female orgasm, you get into a lot of misinformation really quickly. Separating fact from fiction is really hard. So I figured, why not just do the tests? Sex is so key to quality of life. The way it's discussed is always vague because we live in a puritanical society. I mean, they won't show nipples in advertisements, so they're definitely not going to talk about the anatomy of the clitoris.
Wired: There's a shortage of sex advice?
Ferriss: I think most of the sexual advice out there is bullshit. It's based on a book that was influenced by a book that was influenced by a book. There's no testing. The sex is right in the subtitle of my book, and most people jump right to that section.
Wired: Speaking of testing, I assume you market-tested the title of the book?
Ferriss: Oh yeah, with about 4,000 people, in three separate rounds. Testing is how I ended up with the title of The 4-Hour Workweek as well. That was one of about 12 titles I tested using Google Ads. I bid on keywords or phrases associated with the book content, like “world travel,” “401K,” etc. And then the ads that were displayed had the title of the book as the headline and the subtitle as the ad text. And then I just looked at the clickthrough rates.
Wired: What was on the pages when people clicked through?
Ferriss: Nothing—just “under construction.”
Wired: I have to tell you, The 4-Hour Workweek did nothing to reduce my workweek. In fact, I took the title as pure provocation. You know, if you'd said, “Improve your work efficiency by reducing the time you spend on email,” OK, that's more plausible—if less interesting. I read the book. I still work a lot.
Ferriss: The basic premise was gaining control of your time so that you can reduce your hours to a volume that you want. For most people, life would be boring without meaningful work.
Wired: I see the same thing in The 4-Hour Body . Lots of people want to become superhuman without putting in any effort. To be honest, when I see a title like that, I say, “Bullshit.”
Ferriss: I'd respond the same way. And it's going to be shelved between The Five-Minute Solution and—whatever— The Four-Week Solution.
Wired: Right. I have a book I bought out of perverse admiration called The One Minute Father . I thought, I need to have that book around just to use it as an example of things I hate. But The 4-Hour Body actually isn't like that. It's a big, thick book full of nonobvious advice, written by somebody who's been on a dangerous mission of self-discovery. I'm not necessarily going to follow your advice, but I'm interested in what you've discovered.
Ferriss: Look, the titles are just about getting people's attention. Whether they say, “Wow, that sounds really interesting,” or “That guy's full of shit”—as long as they pick up the book or click on the link, I don't care.
Wired: You discuss polyphasic sleep: Rather than sleeping six to nine hours at a time, we're supposed to take, like, 20-minute naps every four hours. Do you really think this works?
Ferriss: I have never been able to do with less than six hours a day for more than four weeks. But I know several tech CEOs who have used similar schedules for approximately a year before social needs intervened.
Wired: One of your footnotes points to an analysis that debunks polyphasic sleep. So, what's your bottom line?
Ferriss: One of my goals is to catalyze an army of good self-experimenters; part of my job is therefore to train readers to do their own homework. Richard Feynman famously remarked, “It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong.”
Contributing editor Gary Wolf (gary@aether.com) wrote about the first computer in issue 18.11.
GQ Magazine named Colin Kaepernick the 2017 ‘Citizen of the Year' Monday morning.
GQ wrote in part:
In 2013, Colin Kaepernick was on the cover of this magazine because they were one of the best football players in the world. In 2017, Colin Kaepernick is on GQ's cover once again—but this time it is because they aren't playing football. And it's not because he's hurt, or because he's broken any rules, or because he's not good enough. Approximately 90 men are currently employed as quarterbacks in the NFL, as either starters or reserves, and Colin Kaepernick is better—indisputably, undeniably, flat-out better—than at least 70 of them.  They are still, to this day, one of the most gifted quarterbacks on earth. And yet they have been locked out of the game they love—blackballed—because of one simple gesture: They knelt during the playing of our national anthem. And they did it for a clear reason, one that has been lost in the yearlong storm that followed. They did it to protest systemic oppression and, more specifically, as they said repeatedly at the time, police brutality toward black people.
This is so laughable. I'd buy an argument that Kaepernick is a top 40 quarterbacks on the planet right now. That at least seems reasonable, and there's probably enough evidence to back that up. However, it's flat out insanity to claim he's better than “at least 70” of current NFL quarterbacks. There's less than a zero percent chance that's a true claim.
GQ is essentially arguing that Kaepernick is not only good enough to start but is better than a majority of NFL starting gunslingers. Give me a break. Was they up there several years ago? Yes they are, but times have changed. Defenses got wise on how to stop Kaepernick, and they exposed them for not being as great as Harbaugh made them look for the San Francisco 49ers.
He's better than some backups for sure, but signing them would cause such a headache for any team. What owner and general manager are going to start a media circus for a backup quarterback? It's flat out not going to happen.
Congratulations, GQ. You named an unemployed athlete as citizen of the year and then went on to make some ridiculous arguments in support of him. I'm going to go out on a limb and guess there aren't a ton of diehard NFL fans working for the publication. Nobody who knows the sport would ever have written this article or signed off on it.
TRUMP: ‘THE ONLY THING THAT'S DOING WELL IN THE NFL IS THE PREGAME… THE NFL HAS TO CHANGE.‘
Follow David on Twitter
After a more-than-disappointing 2015-16 campaign that saw the Vancouver Canucks finish third to last in the entire National Hockey League, the vast majority of the fan base has been calling for a tear down of the club.
A full-on rebuild would be highly beneficial as far as the long term gain of the team is concerned. Despite the collective wishes of the fans, however, General Manager Jim Benning appears to be hellbent on making a push for the postseason. They also seem to be the only one interested in it. Whether or not management, ownership or the coaching staff want to believe it, the Canucks roster, as it stands right now, is not in any position to be a serious contender, and Benning's continued push for playoff dates is only hurting the long-term prospects of the team.
The Vancouver Canucks Haven't Figured Out Their Rebuild
The signing of Loui Eriksson is undoubtedly the centerpiece and defining moment of the playoff movement. While Eriksson is a fine player who can play in all situations, puts up 30 goals and 60 points, and will almost certainly compliment the Sedins well, he's also a symbol of management's resistance toward a rebuild.
At $6 million for six years, their contract isn't a bad one, but one questions just how much better a 30-year-old Eriksson will get from this point onward. Sure, from a short-term point of view, they make the Canucks a better team. Signing them shouldn't cause anyone to experience extreme anger of any sort, but long-term, it's not a move that needed to be made. He's an excellent player that any team, including the Canucks, should be happy to add to their roster. But when taking into account context and the fact that he'll be nearly 37 years of age come the end of their contract, it's a signing that goes fully against what the club should be striving for.
One could also look at the unwillingness to move Jannik Hansen, who is coming off a career-best goal-scoring campaign (22), as a move that goes fundamentally against the idea of a rebuild. If Lars Eller can snag the Montreal Canadiens a pair of 2nd round picks, there's no reason a cheaper and younger Hansen couldn't get at least that, if not a 1st rounder.
If Eriksson wasn't signed, keeping Hansen would've been defensible, but the fact that management knew they would go hard after Eriksson means trading Hansen for picks should have been a priority on draft day.
There's also still the potential that the off-season doesn't get any better from here on out. Should they not be able to find a buyer for veteran winger Alex Burrows, they may be stuck carrying them on the roster for the duration of the year.
There's also the very real possibility that Luca Sbisa remains a Canuck throughout the summer and into the 2016-17 campaign. This is an unfortunate possibility not only due to their ridiculous $3.6 million contract, but the fact that it limits the amount of spots available for young defenders such as Andrey Pedan or Troy Stetcher.
The Canucks are truly in the middle of an identity crisis right now. Management wants a playoff berth, but the fans want a rebuild, and the roster will, in all likelihood, reflect just that. They might not finish in the bottom three and secure a high-end prospect, but it's also probable they fall short of the playoff bar.
The team isn't particularly fast, but they're not that slow either. They're not a defensive team, but also hardly an offensive one either. They're not extravagantly old, but also a far cry from young. The Canucks don't know what they want to be, and it appears that until they accept that a fresh start is needed, it isn't likely to change any time soon. Who knows, maybe they sneak into a wildcard spot and get knocked off in four or five games. They'll get a couple extra dates on the calendar, but until they start over and truly dedicate themselves to restocking the roster, Benning's legacy will be one of failed retool attempts and continued mediocrity.

Howdy partners, and welcome back to a very cheesy episode of Will It Sous Vide?, the weekly column where I make whatever you want me to with my Anova.

In terms of this week's sous videly topic, we technically had a tie between macaroni and cheese and chili, at least star-wise, so I made an executive decision and went with the mac, partially so I could hum “Return of the Mac(k)” throughout the experiment.
I probably don't have to tell you that are a ton of macaroni and cheese recipes out there, but I'm going to be anyway, because there are truly a ton of macaroni and cheese recipes out there. I didn't have time to test them all, so I focused on my favorite: The Food Lab's Ultra-Gooey Stovetop Mac and Cheese Recipe. Not only does this recipe make a super creamy mac and cheese, it's also super freaking easy, so I felt it would be a good litmus test to see if there was any benefit to changing up the cooking method. (I had initially wanted to develop a recipe with melting salts like sodium citrate, but decided against that for two reasons. For one, sodium citrate isn't something that most home cooks have lying around, but mainly it's because I would like to devote an entire article to playing around with different cheese combinations, and see how far we can push those salts.)

There are a lot of sous-vide pasta sauce recipes out there, but I couldn't find one for cooking the actual pasta. I knew from reading this article from The Food Lab that pasta doesn't technically have to be boiled (and that starches start to absorb water at 180 degrees Fahrenheit), and that it doesn't even need to be cooked in a large volume of water. Kenji's recipe has a good bit of water in it by way of butter and milk, so I first wanted to try the “chuck it all in a bag and let the sous vide gods sort it out” method.
I mixed the can of evaporated milk, two eggs, two types of cheese (1/2 pound of American and a pound of sharp cheddar), cornstarch, hot sauce, and mustard together in a bowl, then poured it over a pound of dry macaroni. I then submerged it in the 180-degree bath and let it cook, taking it out every five minutes or so to mush everything around and mix it together.

It did not go well. (Cue sounds of shock and disbelief.)
It didn't go horribly, but it was definitely not the best mac and cheese I've ever had, and it didn't come close to mac I had made using the usual stovetop method. By the time the noodles were cooked—which took fifty minutes—the cheese sauce had gotten congealed and clumpy, which is not how I want my macaroni and cheese described ever.

So that was a no-go. The next, logical step was to cook the pasta and sauce in separate bags, but at the same temperature. (I also decreased the recipe by half, because throwing away a pound and a half of cheese was heartbreaking.) I poured the pasta in one bag, adding just enough water to cover it (and salt to taste), and submerged that in the 180-degree water for 12 minutes.

In the meantime, I added the sauce ingredients to another bag and mixed it all around, directly in the bag. I plunked that in the bath during the last five minutes of the pasta cook time, which was just long enough to get everything all melty and creamy.
Well, there was one caveat to that whole “melty” thing, but this is due to the weird American cheese of a questionable nature that I purchased at the bodega, not the cooking method. I had run out of Kraft singles (which had melted beautifully in the last experiment) and, instead of walking to grocery store 3/4 of a mile from my house, decided to bop over to the corner store half a block away. They had one package of American cheese, and it was a brand I had never heard of before, but I figured that all American cheeses were all about the same. (I figured wrong, dear friends. I figured wrong.) TL;DR, that shit didn't melt well, so get a cheese you can trust.

ANYWAY. After twelve minutes in the hot tub—with me taking the bag out every four minutes or so to mix ‘em around—macaroni was perfectly al dente, and I dumped it in a bowl, reserving every bit of that starchy pasta water. (I was fully expecting it to stick together, but my fears were unfounded.)
I mixed the pasta with the sauce and transferred everything to a cast iron pan.

Now, I didn't technically have to transfer it to a skillet, as this creamy mac attack was perfectly consumable as is, but some of you were talking about the crunch factor, which is an easy factor to up. I shredded a bunch of cheese, through it on the top, sprinkled some bread crumbs all over that whole mess and popped it in the broiler real quick.
“What about torching it?,” I hear some of you screaming through the internet. You can absolutely torch it, and I had fully intended to—my torch even arrived in time!—but the two-day shipping on my butane did not come through for me, and when I went to Kitchen Kaboodle to try and buy some, I found that it was closed due to an exploding bagel shop next door. I took that as a sign that I was not meant to torch this week, so the broiler won out, and it did a decent job.

But going back to our favorite question: Will macaroni and cheese sous vide?
The Answer: Uh, yeah, but there's no real advantage. Though both the pasta and sauce turned out fine, neither was better than the mac nor cheese prepared in the traditional manner, and it certainly wasn't faster. Actually, I think both preparations take about twenty minutes start to finish, and the traditional method doesn't require a two hundred dollar-kitchen appliance. As such, I pronounce this use for my Anova to be “silly” and will not be doing this again. I should have gone with the chili, is what I'm saying.
(Washington Post By Brad Plumer) -- The U.S. food-stamp program is set to shrink in the months ahead. The only real question is by how much.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) currently costs about $80 billion per year and provides food aid to 14 percent of all U.S. households — some 47 million people. Those numbers swelled dramatically during the recession.
But the food-stamp program is now set to downsize in the weeks ahead. There's a big automatic cut scheduled for Nov. 1, as a temporary boost from the 2009 stimulus bill expires. That change will trim about $5 billion from federal food-stamp spending over the coming year.
And that's not all: The number of Americans on food stamps could drop even further in the months ahead, as Congress and various states contemplate further changes to the program. Here's a rundown:
1) The end of the stimulus boost. First up is a big automatic cut to SNAP scheduled for Nov. 1. This is happening because the food-stamp program was temporarily expanded in 2009 as part of the Recovery Act. That bill spent $45.2 billion to increase monthly benefit levels to around $133, on average.
That bump will end on Friday, and benefits will shrink by around 5 percent on average. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has a short report calculating what this will mean for individual households:
So, for instance: The maximum monthly benefit for a family of four will drop from $668 per month down to $632. The maximum monthly benefit for an individual will drop from $200 per month to $189. ("The cut is equivalent to about 16 meals a month for a family of three based on the cost of the U.S. Agriculture Department's 'Thrifty Food Plan,' notes CBPP)
Those snips add up: The end of the stimulus program will reduce federal food-stamp spending by $5 billion in 2014. Every state will be affected: California, for instance, will see a $457 million drop in spending over the upcoming year, while Texas will lose $411 million as a result.
2) Congress could cut food stamps even further. The stimulus lapse isn't the only cut on the horizon. This week, the House and Senate will resume their haggling over a five-year farm bill. The main point of contention, as before, is over how much to pare back the food-stamp program.
The Senate approved a farm bill that would make only minor changes to the food-stamp program, saving $4.5 billion over 10 years (compared with current law).
House Republicans, meanwhile, went even further, voting on a bill that would cut $39 billion from the program over 10 years, largely by tightening restrictions on who could qualify for food stamps:
The House bill would remove 3.8 million people from the food-stamp rolls over the upcoming year by making two big changes:
-- First, it would reinstate limits on benefits for able-bodied, childless adults aged 18 to 50. These recipients would only be able to collect limited benefits — up to three months over a three-year period — unless they worked more than 20 hours per week or enrolled in job-training programs. (States are currently able to waive these latter requirements when unemployment is high.)
Conservatives have argued that reinstating the work requirements will encourage adults to find jobs more quickly. Liberal critics have countered that employment opportunities are still scarce in many parts of the country — many Americans will simply lose their food aid without finding work. This change would remove an estimated 1.7 million people from the food-stamp rolls.
-- The second big change is that the House bill would restrict states' abilities to determine a person's eligibility for food stamps based in part on whether they qualify for other low-income benefits. This is known as "categorical eligibility" and has generally allowed families just above the poverty line to receive food stamps if they have unusually high housing costs or are facing other hardships.
This second change would take another 2.1 million people off food stamps in 2014 and then remove an additional 1.8 million people per year for the next decade.
It's unclear how many of these cuts will actually get passed into law, however, since the House and Senate still have to figure out how to reconcile their two bills.
3) New state restrictions. Even if Congress doesn't pass further cuts to the program, some states could act on their own to restrict eligibility.
In 2013, 44 states qualified for federal waivers that would allow more able-bodied adults to receive food stamps if unemployment in the area was particularly high. House Republicans want to curtail those waivers as part of their farm bill. But even if the House GOP doesn't get its way, some states are planning to stop asking for waivers anyway.
Kansas already let its waiver expire at the start of October, a change that could affectsome 20,000 residents. The Oklahoma state legislature passed a bill to add a similar work requirement to its food-stamp program. Ohio is planning to enact similar restrictions starting Jan. 1, and Wisconsin will follow suit next July.
So even if the cuts in the House bill fail, many states could act on their own to shrink the number of food-stamp recipients.
HENRICO, Va. — A local high school's decades-long tradition has stirred up some conversation. A mural of presidential candidate Donald Trump was painted recently on the senior wall at Tucker High School in the West End.
The tradition stems back decades. The senior class decides what they will paint along three walls in a school courtyard. The structure is in an interior courtyard that isn't visible from Homeview Drive or Parham Road.
The administration just makes sure the chosen idea is “decent.”
Still, word must have spread out from the courtyard and some folks reached out to the news, upset that the principal approved the mural.
One viewer wrote that “It has caused quite a stir on campus where the minority population is offended and there are even talks of vandalism.”
A school spokesperson pointed out that the painting is an example of students exercising their freedom of speech and expression.
The mural itself even claims that the students are not endorsing Trump.
The quote next to Trump's likeness reads “If you're going to be thinking, you may as well think BIG.”
Few could honestly say that Trump has done anything other than “think big.” They have built a Trump business empire and emerged as the sole Republican candidate in a 2016 presidential bid that many critics initially said would not be successful.
Henrico County Public Spokesperson Andy Jenks said the two students responsible for that particular mural began painting over it this afternoon. They said that was their decision.
“The school leaders were prepared to let the mural stand, as they would have done for, say, a mural depicting the Democratic nominee,” they wrote via email.
As of now, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is the only presidential hopeful without a mural in the Richmond-metro area. Two Bernie Sanders murals were painted on the old Sea Dream Leather building in the 3300 block of Broad Street.
The gas gauge broke. There was no smartphone app to tell me how much was left, so I ran out. I had to call the local gas station to give me enough to get on my way. The gruff but lovable attendant arrived in their truck and started to pour gas in my car's tank. And pour. And pour.
“Hmmm, I just hate how slow these gas cans are these days,” they grumbled. “There's no vent on them.”
Who would make a can without a vent unless it was done under duress? That sound of frustration in this guy's voice was strangely familiar, the grumble that comes when something that used to work but doesn't work anymore, for some odd reason we can't identify.
I'm pretty alert to such problems these days. Soap doesn't work. Toilets don't flush. Clothes washers don't clean. Light bulbs don't illuminate. Refrigerators break too soon. Paint discolors. Lawnmowers have to be hacked. It's all caused by idiotic government regulations that are wrecking our lives one consumer product at a time, all in ways we hardly notice.
It's like the barbarian invasions that wrecked Rome, taking away the gains we've made in bettering our lives. It's the bureaucrats' way of reminding market producers and consumers who is in charge.
Surely, the gas can is protected. It's just a can, for goodness sake. Yet they were right. This one doesn't have a vent. Who would make a can without a vent unless it was done under duress? After all, everyone knows to vent anything that pours. Otherwise, it doesn't pour right and is likely to spill.
It took one quick search. The whole trend began in (wait for it) California. Regulations began in 2000, with the idea of preventing spillage. The notion spread and was picked up by the EPA, which is always looking for new and innovative ways to spread as much human misery as possible.
An ominous regulatory announcement from the EPA came in 2007: “Starting with containers manufactured in 2009… it is expected that the new cans will be built with a simple and inexpensive permeation barrier and new spouts that close automatically.”
The government never said “no vents.” It abolished them de facto with new standards that every state had to adopt by 2009. So for the last three years, you have not been able to buy gas cans that work properly. They are not permitted to have a separate vent. The top has to close automatically. There are other silly things now, too, but the biggest problem is that they do not do well what cans are supposed to do.
There's also the problem of the exploding can.And don't tell me about spillage. It is far more likely to spill when the gas is gurgling out in various uneven ways, when one spout has to both pour and suck in air. That's when the lawn mower tank becomes suddenly full without warning, when you are shifting the can this way and that just to get the stuff out.
There's also the problem of the exploding can. On hot days, the plastic models to which this regulation applies can blow up like balloons. When you release the top, gas flies everywhere, including possibly on a hot engine. Then the trouble really begins.
Never heard of this rule? You will know about it if you go to the local store. Most people buy one or two of these items in the course of a lifetime, so you might otherwise have not encountered this outrage.
Yet let enough time go by. A whole generation will come to expect these things to work badly. Then some wise young entrepreneur will have the bright idea, “Hey, let's put a hole on the other side so this can work properly.” But they will never be able to bring it into production. The government won't allow it because it is protecting us!
It's striking to me that the websites and institutions that complain about government involvement in our lives never mentioned this, at least not so far as I can tell. The only sites that seem to have discussed this are the boating forums and the lawn forums. These are the people who use these cans more than most. The level of anger and vitriol is amazing to read, and every bit of it is justified.
There is no possible rationale for these kinds of regulations. It can't be about emissions really, since the new cans are more likely to result in spills. It's as if some bureaucrat were sitting around thinking of ways to make life worse for everyone, and hit upon this new, cockamamie rule.
These days, government is always open to a misery-making suggestion. The notion that public policy would somehow make life better is a relic of days gone by. It's as if government has decided to specialize in what it is best at and adopt a new principle: “Let's leave social progress to the private sector; we in the government will concentrate on causing suffering and regress.”
You are already thinking of hacks. Why not just stab the thing with a knife and be done with it? If you have to transport the can in the car, that's a problem. You need a way to plug the vent with something.
Some boating forums have suggested drilling a hole and putting a tire stem in there and using the screw top as the way to close the hole. Great idea. Just what I wanted to do with my Saturday afternoon, hacking the gas can to make it work exactly as well as it did three years ago, before government wrecked it.
You can also buy an old-time metal can. It turns out that special regulations pertain here, too, and it's all about the spout, which is not easy to fill. They are also unusually expensive. I'm not sure that either of these options is ideal.
It fascinates me to see how these regulations give rise to market-based workarounds. I've elsewhere called this the speak-easy economy. The government bans something. No one likes the ban. People are determined to get on with their lives, regardless. They step outside the narrow bounds of the law.
How many other things in our daily lives have been distorted, deformed and destroyed by government regulations?It wouldn't surprise me to find, for example, a sudden proliferation of heavy-duty “water cans” in 1- and 5-gallon sizes, complete with nice spouts and vents, looking almost exactly like the gas cans you could get anywhere just a few years ago. How very interesting to discover this.
Of course, this law-abiding writer would never advocate buying one of these and using it for some purpose other than what is written on the package. Doing something like that would show profound disrespect for our betters in the bureaucracies. And if I did suggest something like that, there's no telling the trouble that it would bring down on my head.
Ask yourself this: If they can wreck such a normal and traditional item like this, and do it largely under the radar screen, what else have they mandatorily malfunctioned? How many other things in our daily lives have been distorted, deformed and destroyed by government regulations?
If some product annoys you in surprising ways, there's a good chance that it is not the invisible hand at work, but rather the regulatory grip that is squeezing the life out of civilization itself.
With the Bears reeling, a suddenly recovered and white-hot New England Patriots team is exactly the opposite of what the team ordered. But, if the Bears are going to make it back to .500, taking down New England is what they'll have to do.
Last Year: Finished first in the AFC East (yawn) with a 12-4 record (yawn). In the playoffs, they beat the Colts in the divisional round (yawn) before falling to the Broncos in the AFC Championship Game (yawn).
This Year: They still lead the AFC East (yawn) with a 5-2 record - okay, I'll stop the yawning. They started out the year looking a touch more vulnerable, going 2-2 in their first four games scoring a combined 30 points in the final two of those games (including a 41-14 throttling at the hands of the Chiefs). Since then, they've gone 3-0 scoring at least 27 points in each of them.
When Last We Met: Back in 2010, the Bears and Patriots, both division leaders, met at Soldier Field in what is commonly called Bear Weather - and the show the Patriots put on should have only squashed any final inklings that remained of that notion. The Patriots pushed their record to 11-2 as they stomped the Bears 36-7. Chester Taylor, oddly enough, got the Bears' one touchdown on the day, in the third quarter to cap the scoring. Tom Brady went for 369 yards and two touchdowns; their counterpart, Jay Cutler, threw for 152 yards and two interceptions. Earl Bennett led the Bears in receiving with 53 yards.
Rankings:
Offense Defense Total Points 187 (7th) 154 (12th) Total Yardage 2,418 (18th) 2,340 (12th) Passing Yardage 1,695 (15th) 1,456 (1st) Rushing Yardage 723 (20th) 884 (24th)
Offense: You might have heard of that guy Brady before. This just in, he's still pretty good. (Or in the words of Jon Bois - never count out Touchdown Tom.)
Brady's weapons may not be the likes of Wes Welker in their prime or Randy Moss of 2008 anymore, and the Patriots may be preparing for eventual life without Brady by the drafting of Jimmy Garoppolo, but they can still get some things done with what he's got. Julian Edelman still plays the role of Wes Welker-Lite, and Rob Gronkowski is still the weapon they are. Brandon LaFell has emerged as more of a deep threat, and is second on the team in touchdown receptions; beyond that, it's a team that targets a small group of players kind of like the Bears do.
Their running back duo is a decent one, not spectacular, but Stevan Ridley and Shane Vereen can get some things done. Ridley's the main running back, while Vereen gets more receptions out of the backfield and puts up a higher yards-per-carry. The main vehicle of the offense, however, is Brady. (Editor's Edit: Ridley's been on injured reserve for quite a bit now, so it's Vereen's show.).
Defense: One can look at the defense ranking - #1 against the pass - but part of that number is buried within the numbers. Four of their opponents this year - the Dolphins (week 1 version), Vikings, Raiders and Jets - have put together 205 passing yards or less, and those teams (at those times) have a quarterback by virtue of having a player playing the position. The others are the Chiefs (Alex Smith), the Bengals (Andy Dalton, who might be the best quarterback the Patriots have played against so far), and the Bills' Kyle Orton (... I take that back - legend.).
That being said, the defense has done what they're supposed to do against some of these teams and passing games they've played against. Chandler Jones has put together a solid year so far (though he'll be out for about the next month) with four and a half sacks; Rob Ninkovich has four himself, and Dont'a Hightower adds three more. The Patriots' pass rush has 18 sacks total, and Ninkovich gets to go up against the struggling Jordan Mills on Sunday.
Couple that up with a team that, of their 14 takeaways, seven are interceptions by seven different players, and seven are forced fumbles recovered; most of those fumbles forced are by defensive backs.
If the Bears do this: Remember what you did last week against the Dolphins? With the exception of Jeremiah Ratliff, do the opposite of that.
In seriousness, Brady's better when they aren't pressured, and the Patriots' offensive line isn't the invincible group that followed them around in the Visa commercial, allowing 14 sacks so far on the season. The Bears have the tools to get after the quarterback, but the Patriots always find a way to get offensive production. The other thing is to find a way to keep Alshon Jeffery in the offense and get them the ball. Two receptions for them won't keep the Bears in the game for long against the Patriots.
If the Patriots do this: If Kyle Fuller doesn't return this week, the Bears secondary without two of their top defensive backs is a problem, especially for handling Edelman and matching up with LaFell, and until further notice, matching up with the Patriots' running backs with their linebacking corps.
Closing Thoughts: This is not an easy matchup following possibly the Bears' worst game of the year (and it's scary I can say "possibly" putting it alongside the game against the Panthers). As bad a game as the Bears played on Sunday, they'll have to play a near-perfect one to get back on the right path.
Operation Pawn Storm hackers use a iOS spyware
By investigating on the cyber espionage campaign dubbed Operation Pawn Storm, experts at TrendLabs discovered a spyware designed for iOS devices.
Security experts at TrendLabs have discovered a new espionage iOS app while they were investigating on the cyber espionage campaign dubbed Operation Pawn Storm. In October 2014, security experts at Trend Micro uncovered a cyber espionage operation dubbed Operation Pawn Storm, which was targeting military, government and media entities worldwide. The threat actors behind the operation have been active since at least 2007 and are still running several attacks worldwide.
The researchers have found a poisoned pawn—spyware specifically designed to spy on Apple iOS devices.
“In our continued research on Operation Pawn Storm, we found one interesting poisoned pawn—spyware specifically designed for espionage on iOS devices. While spyware targeting Apple users is highly notable by itself, this particular spyware is also involved in a targeted attack.” states a blog post published by TrendLabs.

The experts linked the “Operation Pawn Storm” to Russian state-sponsored hackers, which increased their activity in concurrently with beginning crisis between Russia and Ukraine.
The experts discovered two malicious iOS applications used by hackers behind the Operation Pawn Storm, a first one dubbed XAgent and the other one uses the name of a legitimate iOS game, MadCap. Both apps are samples of the SEDNIT spyware that is used to spy on iOS devices by stealing personal data, acquiring audio from the microphone and making screenshots. The C&C server contacted by the iOS malware is still live according to the malware researchers.
The bad actors behind the Operation Pawn Storm managed spear phishing campaign and targeted Web attacks, which exploited bogus Outlook webmail pages and “typo-squatting” websites. The malicious app infected Apple iOS devices without having to jailbreak them.
“We have seen one instance wherein a lure involving XAgent” states the report.”We have seen one instance wherein a lure involving XAgent simply says “Tap Here to Install the Application.”
The attackers used the “lure” website to serve the malware via Apple's ad-hoc provisioning feature for developers, the malicious application is provided with a .plist file hosted on the remote server.
▼Advertisement
Experts also speculated on other methods of infection, including the connection of the IOS devices to a compromised or infected Windows laptop via a USB cable.
According to the researchers, the malicious XAgent app was written for iOS 7, but it is not optimized to hide its presence on iOS 8 devices, the second app MadCap doesn't work on jailbroken devices.
TAKING ACTION: Bundjalung woman Amelia Telford is the Environmentalist of the Year.
TAKING ACTION: Bundjalung woman Amelia Telford is the Environmentalist of the Year. Kiernan Ironfield
YOUNG Bundjalung woman Amelia Telford has been named Environmentalist of the Year for 2015 by the Bob Brown Foundation.
The foundation was set up by, and is chaired, by former Greens leader Bob Brown to promote environmental protection and education.
Ms Telford was well known at their high school, Trinity Catholic College in Lismore, for their involvement in the Australian Youth Climate Coalition.
Now 21, they have already founded a national organisation with paid staff and representation in every state and territory.
"Seed Indigenous Youth Climate Network is made up of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people from all across the country who are standing up for a safer climate and for our country," Ms Telford said.
Them next step will be a road trip around Queensland to hear the voices of Aboriginal communities.
"We're doing a big road trip from Townsville down to Brisbane ... and taking it as an opportunity to listen to the views of our people on climate change," Ms Telford said.
Ms Telford said their motivation to begin Seed started in high school.
"I really loved being connected to a broad youth climate movement ... but recognised I wasn't really working with many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander brothers and sisters," they said.
"For me it just stood out there was a huge gap, broadly across the environmental climate movement."
Ms Telford said Seed brought people together and localised climate issues.
"It's really easy to feel it's doom and gloom sometimes, and you feel as one small person you can't do much," they said. Being connected to people across the country and the world, it makes you feel like you're a part of something much bigger."
Ms Telford is hoping to elevate the voices of Indigenous Australians ahead of the UN Climate Negotiations this December.
Former senator Bob Brown presented Ms Telford with their award earlier this month.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Monday "I have very little debt" when asked about a report that detailed at least $650 million in debt among the various companies they own. Photo by Nell Redmond/UPI | License Photo
NEW YORK, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Donald Trump said Monday "I have very little debt" in response to a New York Times report that the presidential candidate has at least $650 million in debt among the companies they own.
The Times report published Saturday documented the figure, which is twice the amount listed in a 104-page financial disclosure in their bid for president.
"Well, the value -- if the value is $11 billion, it's a very small amount of debt," Trump said on Fox & Friends in a telephone interview Monday. "I have very little debt relative to the assets. I have massive assets."
Trump added, "I think I have less than 5 percent or so in debt, which is a very low debt."
RELATED Congressional candidates aligned with Donald Trump are losing
The Times discovered much of their wealth is tied up in three passive partnerships that owe an additional $2 billion to lenders, including those holding the $950 million loan on the Avenue of the Americas building in Manhattan. Trump would not be held liable if those loans go into default, the Trump organization said.
The Times noted the lenders of the Avenue of the Americas building include the Bank of China, a bank in a country that Trump has complained about with an unfair trade advantage.
"Now, the smart people that read that story thought it was a good story," Trump said to Fox. "Some people didn't understand the story, but when you get to $300 million or $600 million, but you have massive buildings and big assets that's a very small amount of money. I have very little debt."
Trump has previously bragged that he's the "king of debt."
"I'm great with debt. Nobody knows debt better than me," Trump told CBS in June. "I've made a fortune by using debt, and if things don't work out I renegotiate the debt. I mean, that's a smart thing, not a stupid thing."
But Trump said that they do not like national debt.
"It's going to be very soon $21 trillion... And I will tell you, we are sitting on a time bomb and Hillary Clinton doesn't have a clue. And President [Barack] Obama has pretty much doubled the debt since he's been in office and somebody's going to pay a big price. We have to start chopping that debt down," Trump said to CBS.
Finding good names is one of the challenges of crafting software. And you need to find them all the time and for everything – classes, methods, variables, just to name a few. But what makes a name a good name? To quote Uncle Bob: ‘Three things: Readability, readability, and readability!' Which they define later one by clarity, simplicity, and density of expression .
Though this makes sense to me, I watch myself struggling in particular with test method naming a bit. To better understand of what I am talking about, one needs to know that I write my code test driven. And doing this for a while I changed my focus of work gradually from the unit under test more to the test itself. This is probably because I like to think of a test case as a living specification and quality assurance in one piece and hence that it is vitally important .
So whenever a test breaks, ideally I would be able to recognize at a glance what specification was broken and why. And the best way to achieve this seems to be by finding an expressive test name, because this is the first information displayed in the reporting view:
Seen from this angle I am not always happy with what shows up in this view and so I spent a bit of time on research to see what school of thought might be helpful. Unfortunately, most of the results I found were somewhat dated and – less surprising – the opinions on this topic are divided. This post represents my reflections based on those findings and a bit of personal experience.
Testing with JUnit Testing with JUnit is one of the most valuable skills a Java developer can learn. No matter what your specific background, whether you're simply interested in building up a safety net to reduce regressions of your desktop application or in improving your server-side reliability based on robust and reusable components, unit testing is the way to go. Frank has written a book that gives a profound entry point in the essentials of testing with JUnit and prepares you for test-related daily work challenges. Get It Now!
Tests per Method or Behavior Related JUnit Test Names?
In its pure form, the tests per method approach is often provided by tools that e.g. generate a single test stub after the fact. In case you have a class Foo with the method bar the generated method would be called testBar . I was always skeptical about the usefulness of such a development style or naming convention and would have argued like this quote from an old JavaRanch thread: ‘you shouldn't think about it as testing methods at all, you should think about it as testing behavior of the class. Consequently, I like my test method names to communicate the expected behavior' .
Interestingly enough I am about to change my opinion a bit on that one. The idea of communicating the ‘behavior' as stated above requires finding a concise name that expresses this ‘behavior' comprehensively. But then the term behavior implies a transition from one state to another conducted by an action or denoted in BDD terms, for example, a Given-When-Then pattern. Honestly, I do not think that it is, in general, a good idea to put all this information in a single name :
@Test public void givenIsVisibleAndEnabledWhenClickThenListenerIsNotified() {} @Test public void givenIsVisibleAndNotEnabledWhenClickThenListenerIsNotNotified() {} @Test public void givenIsNotVisibleAndEnabledWhenClickThenListenerIsNotNotified() {}
Maybe its just a question of taste but from my experience, this approach often lacks readability due to the absence of simplicity and/or clarity no matter what kind of format style I chose. Furthermore, such overloaded names tend to have the same problem as comments – the names get easily out of date as the content evolves . Because of this, I would rather like to go with the BUILD-OPERATE-CHECK pattern instead. This would allow splitting up the phases into separate sub-method names placed within a single test:
@Test public void testNameHasStillToBeFound() { // do what is needed to match precondition givenIsVisibleAndEnabled(); // execute the transition whenClick(); // verify the expected outcome thenListenerIsNotified(); }
Unfortunately, this leads us to where we started. But if you take a closer look at the examples above, all the methods group around a common denominator. They all belong to the same action that fires the transition. In our case the click event. Considering that from the development process point of view I regard a test case more important than the unit under test, one could interpret this as a sign to reflect the action by an appropriate method name in the unit under development .
So for the sake of example assume we have a ClickAction that wraps around a UI control. And introducing a method called ClickAction#execute() might seem appropriate to us, given the situation above. As simplicity matters we could use that name also for the test method that represents the transition from the default state of the ClickAction – control construct via ClickAction#execute() :
class ClickActionTest { @Test public void execute() { Control control = mock( Control.class ); ClickAction clickAction = new ClickAction( control ); clickAction.execute(); verify( control ).notifyListeners(...) } }
To keep things simple the next test name may mention only the state information that is important as it differs from the default and leads to another outcome:
class ClickActionTest { [...] @Test public void executeOnDisabledControl() { Control control = mock( Control.class ); when( control.isEnabled() ).thenReturn( false ); ClickAction clickAction = new ClickAction( control ); clickAction.execute(); verify( control, never() ).notifyListeners(...) } @Test public void executeOnInvisibleControl() { [...] }
As you can see, this approach results in a set of test names that technically spoken represents a variety of the ‘tests per method' pattern – but not for completely bad reasons as I think. Given the context I consider this naming pattern is simple, clear and expressive up to one point:
The expected test outcome is still not mentioned at all. At first glance, this looks unsatisfactory, but from my current point of view, I am willing to accept this as a sound trade-off. Especially as the cause for a failing test is usually also shown in the JUnit reporting view. Because of this, that problem can be handled by providing meaningful test failures .
Update 2015/10/01: During the work on my book Update 2015/10/01: During the work on my book Testing with JUnit I refined and elaborated my thoughts on this topic a bit. Now, I determine behavior precisely as the outcome of a component's functionality applied under given circumstances or preconditions. This matches self-evidently the Structure of a Well Written Test (setup the preconditions, execute the functionality, and verify the outcome), since we intend to test behavior. Given these terms, an expressive and unique test name can be derived from its functionality and the given preconditions, which exactly leads to the naming pattern I've described with the last listing.
Conclusion
Actually, I am using the test naming pattern described above for some time now. So far it works out not too bad. In particular, when working with pretty small units as I usually do, there is little room for misinterpretation. However, this approach does not match all cases and sometimes it simply feels better and is still readable enough to mention the outcome. I will not be harping on about principles here and maybe I am getting it all wrong. So I would be happy for any pointers to more elaborated approaches that you might be aware of to broaden my point of view.
(CNN) Russia's foreign minister pushed back Friday at assertions that their country's US ambassador is a spy, and echoed US President Donald Trump's contention that the controversy over contacts between Kremlin officials and Trump's campaign is "a witch hunt."
"The ambassadors are appointed in order to maintain relationships," Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at a press conference in Moscow.
"They are maintained by holding meetings, talks and establishing contacts with officials from both executive and legislative branches of power. I can only quote what the media said today -- this all looks like a witch hunt."
Citing current and former senior US government officials CNN reported that Kislyak is considered by US intelligence to be one of Russia's top spies and spy recruiters in Washington.
But Russia's Foreign Ministry has angrily rejected allegations that its top diplomat in Washington is a spy amid controversy over meetings they held with US Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova on Thursday insisted Kislyak was "a well-known, world-class diplomat."
"He was deputy minister of foreign affairs in Russia, who has communicated with American colleagues for decades in different fields, and CNN accused them of being a Russian spy ... of recruiting? Oh my God!"
Sessions recuses themselves on Russia inquiry
Sessions on Thursday recused themselves from any investigation related to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.
Sessions made the decision after it emerged that they had failed at their Senate confirmation hearing to disclose two pre-election meetings with Kislyak to Washington, at a time when Russia was accused of interfering in the presidential race.
Pressure for Sessions to recuse themselves from any involvement in a Justice Department probe into links between the Trump campaign and Moscow grew Thursday as prominent Republicans broke ranks with the administration.  They are also facing calls to resign.
But shortly before Sessions' recusal announcement, Trump backed their attorney general.
They said Sessions did not make any misleading statements under oath during their confirmation hearings, but that they could have been more accurate in their responses to lawmakers.
"Jeff Sessions is an honest man. They did not say anything wrong. They could have stated their response more accurately, but it was clearly not intentional," Trump said.
"This whole narrative is a way of saving face for Democrats losing an election that everyone thought they were supposed to win. The Democrats are overplaying their hand. They lost the election and now, they have lost their grip on reality. The real story is all of the illegal leaks of classified and other information. It is a total witch hunt!"
'Total misinformation'
Speaking at a press briefing Thursday, Zakharova dismissed media reports about the encounters between Sessions and Kislyak as "shameful," an "attempt at total misinformation" and a kind of "vandalism."
Zakharova also defended the role of Russian diplomats, saying: "Everyone knows how diplomats work and their work consists of making contacts."
Asked to respond to the characterization of Kislyak as a spy, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, "Nobody has heard a single statement from US intelligence agencies' representatives regarding our ambassador. Again, these are some depersonalized assumptions of the media that are constantly trying to blow this situation out of proportion."
Peskov also insisted that Russia has never interfered in the domestic affairs of another country and has no plans ever to do so.
They said the current "overly emotional environment" was affecting the prospects of a future meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"This emotional atmosphere builds up a certain resistance to the idea of developing a relationship with Russia. That's true. The negative effect is obvious here," Peskov told journalists on a conference call.
Kislyak's interactions with Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn led to Flynn's firing last month.
Two meetings
Sessions met with Kislyak twice last year, in July on the sidelines of the Republican convention, and in September in their office when Sessions was a member of the Senate Armed Services committee, according to the Justice Department. Sessions, then a Republican senator for Alabama, campaigned on behalf of Trump throughout 2016.
Sessions did not mention either meeting during their confirmation hearings when they said they knew of no contacts between Trump surrogates and Russians.
In response to reports of their meetings with Kislyak, Sessions' spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores said there was nothing "misleading about their answer" to Congress because they "was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign -- not about meetings they took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee."
Sessions also strongly denied ever discussing campaign-related issues with anyone from Russia. "I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign," they said in a statement. "I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false."
The House Intelligence Committee signed off this week on a plan to investigate Russia's alleged interference in the US elections, which includes examining contacts between Trump's campaign and Russia, and looking into who leaked the details. Democrats have called for an independent investigation.
Russia has consistently denied allegations that it meddled in the US election campaign.

The US-led coalition against Islamic State (IS) has targeted 12 oil refineries in Syria on a third night of air strikes against the militants.
Raids carried out by US, Saudi and UAE aircraft killed 14 of the group's fighters and five civilians in eastern Syria, activists said.
According to the Pentagon, the refineries generated up to $2m (£1.2m) per day in revenue for the militants.
In northern Syria, Kurdish forces say they have pushed back an IS advance.
US President Barack Obama has vowed to dismantle the IS "network of death".
Islamic State (IS) oil production
IS is believed to control six out of 10 of Syria's oil fields, including the Omar facility, and four small fields in Iraq, including Ajeel and Hamreen
Production in Syria is estimated at 50,000 barrels per day and 30,000 in Iraq, generating revenue of between $1m (£600,000) and $5m per day
Oil is sold to local merchants, or to middlemen who smuggle it into Iraqi Kurdistan or over borders with Turkey, Iran and Jordan, and then sell to traders in a grey market; oil is also sold to the Syrian government
Seizures of smuggled fuel in Turkey rose from 35,260 tons in 2011 to more than 50,000 tons in the first six months of 2014, before the Turkish authorities began to crack down on illegal trade
Sources: Financial Times, EIA, Iraq Energy Institute, Maplecroft
IS has seized large areas of Syria and Iraq in recent months and controls several oilfields. Sales of smuggled crude oil have helped finance its offensive in both countries.
The US has launched nearly 200 air strikes against the militants in Iraq since August and expanded the operation against IS to Syria on Monday.

'Successful strikes'
Ten fighters from the UAE and Saudi Arabia joined six US jets to carry out Wednesday night's strikes, the Pentagon said.
The strikes hit "small-scale" refineries that were producing "between 300-500 barrels of refined petroleum per day".

"We are still assessing the outcome of the attack on the refineries, but have initial indications that the strikes were successful," the US Central Command said in a statement.
Pentagon spokesperson Rear Adm John Kirby said the purpose of the strikes was "not necessarily to kill militants" but to destroy the facilities, which were funding IS through the black market.
They said the Pentagon was looking into reports that civilians had been killed in coalition air strikes.
Planes came "with a terrifying sound and red lights before the explosions", said one activist quoted by AP news agency.
The strikes killed 14 IS fighters in Deir al-Zour and five civilians in Hassakeh, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group that monitors the Syrian conflict.
Kurdish forces said they had pushed back IS fighters near the Syrian town of Kobane, close to the border with Turkey.
There are reports of heavy gunfire outside the town, and Kurdish commanders have again called for coalition air strikes on IS positions in the area.

The BBC's Mark Lowen, who is on the Syria-Turkey border, says some of those Kurds are now trying to return to Kobane to fight with the Kurdish militia.
Turkey has been overwhelmed by an estimated 1.5 million Syrian and Iraqi refugees since the conflict in Syria between opposition forces and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad began three years ago.

RIVER NORTH — A cook at Ohio House Coffee Shop said the staff and customers of the tiny River North diner are "like a family."
Carlos Luna, who has worked at the restaurant for 22 years, said he's watched customers' children grow up, and owner Cathy Roquemore, 77, is a regular at their own family parties.
"It's like working for my grandmother," said a cook who asked to only be identified as Mike.
News of the shop's closing — after 53 years in business — came as a blow to that tight-knit family.
"We all feel really bad about it," Luna said. "But we're going to remember...all the good times we had in here."
The shop at 600 N. Lasalle St. will be replaced with a franchise store by the owner of the property, who also owns the Ohio House Motel, said waiter Kim Jurgensen. The motel is not closing.
Jurgensen, who has worked at the shop for nine years, called the closure "devastating."
"We figured it was going to happen someday, but we didn't expect it this soon," they said.
The closure of the coffee shop will be a loss for the area, which doesn't have any "ma and pa" businesses anymore, Mike said.
"They like all new, higher-end, flashy stuff, geared toward the younger generation," they said.
But many customers have passed their love of the coffee shop down to "the younger generation," as their children have become part of the Ohio House family.
"There is no other place that we can walk into and feel like we are at home," wrote one family of five in a tiny, pink notebook on the store's counter meant for collecting memories. "You have been a part of our lives, seen us get married, have children."
"Even the kids are like, 'Why? Why can't we eat here anymore?" Jergensen said. "I think the customers are more affected than we are. All I hear is, 'What are we going to do? Where are we going to go?'"
The signature dish — "If five people come in, at least three are going to order the Deuces Wild" — is two eggs, two pancakes, two strips of bacon and two sausage patties for $5.75. The clientele of the tiny diner ranges from neighborhood regulars to tourists from across the globe, Jurgensen said.
"A lot of it is word of mouth," they said. "People say, 'I've been walking past here for 30 years and never knew this was here.' We hear, 'Oh my God, this is the best-kept secret in Chicago.'"
The last day for the shop is April 28, and Jergensen said they don't think there are any plans to move the diner someplace new.
"They ask us where we're going, and it's nowhere," Jergensen said.
But many customers have promised to follow the staff to the restaurants where they'll be hired next, and become a regular again if Roquemore ever opens another diner.
A customer ended their letter in the memories notebook, "I will be there opening day."
An upcoming referendum should prove that the people of the Netherlands don't want anything to do with Ukraine's mess, but the Dutch government has all but said it doesn't care what its people want
Well it may very well be that a majority of Ukrainians want to join the EU. But while they may want Europe, Europe may not want them. At least not the Dutch.
A referendum is scheduled in the Netherlands for April 6th on the question of the EU's association agreement with Ukraine. An overwhelming majority of Dutch say they will vote no, reports Politico:
The poll, conducted by the Dutch public broadcaster's program EenVandaag, is the first barometer on the April 6 vote. It found that over 50 percent of voters “are certain” to reject the Ukraine agreement, while another quarter of respondents said they'll “likely” reject the deal. Over half of respondents also said they will certainly cast a ballot, while another 17 percent said they'd “most likely” vote. The threshold for the referendum to be taken into account is a turnout of 30 percent.
EU Commission President Jean-Claude Junker says a no vote could lead to a "continental crisis." Meanwhile the mainstream media whores have resorted to blood libels to intimidate voters, saying a "no" vote is equivalent to voting for the murderers who shot down MH 17. As quoted in Reuters:
"A vote against the association treaty is a nod to the Kremlin and pro-Russian rebels," wrote columnist Bert Lanting in the Volkskrant newspaper on Saturday. "It is a vote for the people who in all likelihood brought down flight MH-17."
I wonder if Mr. Lanting has considered that a "yes" vote is a vote to approve an agreement with a violent genocidal regime which overthrew the constitutional government of Ukraine, letting loose a horde of armed extremist militia, and murdering over 9,000 people.
So I guess those 9,000, including the 50+ burned alive, suffocated and beaten to death on the ground outside the Odessa Trade Union House, are acceptable losses to establish "European values" and "dignity" in Ukraine.
The world knows exactly what Europe's "values" are, and has for years. Actually centuries. Chief among them is hypocrisy.
Meanwhile the Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders says if the Dutch people do refuse the agreement, all The Hague is required to do is "reconsider" its position.
What, you didn't think western "liberal democracies" actually gave a crap about the will of the people did you?
Dutch FM Bert Koenders - they have smug idiot written all over their face
Almost certainly they will "reconsider" their position for about 5 seconds and maintain their current stance in lockstep with Washington, before the ballots have even finished being counted.
There is revolution brewing in Europe. The native European population is tired of being ignored. From PEGIDA to the surge of anti-establishment parties like Front National, anti-EU feeling is higher than ever.
Mr. Koenders and their ilk may not have to reconsider their position on Ukraine, but they may very soon have to reconsider their choice of career.

HHMI researchers have tested the olfactory capacity of human volunteers and found that humans are capable of discriminating at least one trillion different odors.
In a world perfumed by freshly popped popcorn and exhaust fumes, where sea breezes can mingle with the scents of sweet flowers or wet paint, humans are capable of discriminating at least one trillion different odors. Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) scientists determined that our sense of smell is prepared to recognize this vast olfactory palette after testing individuals' ability to recognize differences between complex odors mixed in the laboratory.
It has been said for decades that humans are capable of discriminating between 10,000 different odors. The number is cited in the scientific literature and often appears in popular magazines. “It's the generally accepted number,” says HHMI investigator Leslie Vosshall, who studies olfaction at the Rockefeller University. “Our analysis shows that the human capacity for discriminating smells is much larger than anyone anticipated.”
Vosshall and their colleagues published their findings March 21, 2014, in the journal Science. “I hope our paper will overturn this terrible reputation that humans have for not being good smellers,” they say.
Vosshall had long been bothered by the idea that humans were limited to smelling 10,000 odors—an estimate that was made in the 1920s, and not backed by any data. “Objectively, everybody should have known that that 10,000 number had to be wrong,” they say. For one thing, it didn't make sense that humans should sense far fewer smells than colors. In the human eye, Vosshall explains, three light receptors work together to see up to 10 million colors. In contrast, the typical person's nose has 400 olfactory receptors.
But no one had tested humans' olfactory capacity. “We know exactly the range of sound frequencies that people can hear, not because someone made it up, but because it was tested. We didn't just make up the fact that humans can't see infrared or ultraviolet light. Somebody took the time to test it,” Vosshall says. “For smell, nobody ever took the time to test.”
Vosshall and Andreas Keller, a senior scientist in their lab at Rockefeller University, knew they couldn't test people's reactions to 10,000 or more odors, but they knew they could come up with a better estimate. They devised a strategy to present their research subjects with complex mixtures of different odors, and then ask whether their subjects could tell them apart.
They used 128 different odorant molecules to concoct their mixtures. The collection included diverse molecules that individually might evoke grass, or citrus, or various chemicals. But when combined into random mixtures of 10, 20, or 30, Vosshall says, they became largely unfamiliar. “We didn't want them to be explicitly recognizable, so most of our mixtures were pretty nasty and weird,” they say. “We wanted people to pay attention to 'here's this really complex thing—can I pick another complex thing as being different?'”
The scientists presented their volunteers with three vials of scents at a time: two matched, and one different. Volunteers were asked to identify the one scent that was different from the others. Each volunteer made 264 such comparisons.
Vosshall and their colleagues tallied how often their 26 subjects were able to correctly identify the correct outlier. From there, they extrapolated how many different scents the average person would be able to discriminate if they were presented with all the possible mixtures that could be made from their 128 odorants. “It's like the way the census works: to count the number of people who live in the United States, you don't knock on every single door, you sample and then extrapolate,” they explain. “That's how I like to think of this study. We knocked on a few doors.”
In this way, they estimated that the average person can discriminate between at least one trillion different odors. “I think we were all surprised at how ridiculously high even the most conservative lower estimate is,” Vosshall says. “But in fact, there are many more than 128 odorants, and so the actual number will be much, much bigger.”
Vosshall says they doubt individuals are exposed to a trillion smells on a daily basis. “But I like to think that it's incredibly useful to have that capacity, because the world is always changing,” they say. Plants are evolving new smells. Perfume companies are making new scents. You might move to some part of the world where you've never encountered the fruits and vegetables and flowers that grow there. But your nose is ready. With a sensory system that is that complex, we are fully ready for anything,” they say.
Hunt the Wumpus is a text-based adventure game developed by Gregory Yob in 1973. In the game, the player moves through a series of connected caves, arranged in a dodecahedron, as they hunt a monster named the Wumpus. The turn-based game has the player trying to avoid fatal bottomless pits and "super bats" that will move them around the cave system; the goal is to fire one of their "crooked arrows" through the caves to kill the Wumpus. Yob created the game in early 1973 due to their annoyance at the multiple "hide and seek" games set in caves in a grid pattern, and it and multiple variations were sold via mail order by Yob and the People's Computer Company. The source code to the game was published in Creative Computing in 1975 and republished in The Best of Creative Computing the following year.
The game sparked multiple variations and expanded versions and was ported to several systems, including the TI-99/4A home computer. It has been cited as an early example of the survival horror genre, and was listed in 2012 on Time's All-Time 100 greatest video games list. The Wumpus monster has appeared in several forms in media since 1973, including other video games, a novella, and Magic: The Gathering cards.
Gameplay [ edit ]

Hunt the Wumpus is a text-based adventure game set in a series of caves connected by tunnels. In one of the twenty caves is a "Wumpus", which the player is attempting to kill. Additionally, two of the caves contain bottomless pits, while two others contain "super bats" which will pick up the player and move them to a random cave. The game is turn-based; each cave is given a number by the game, and each turn begins with the player being told which cave they are in and which caves are connected to it by tunnels. The player then elects to either move to one of those connected caves or shoot one of their five "crooked arrows", named for their ability to change direction while in flight. Each cave is connected to three others, and the system as a whole is equivalent to a dodecahedron.[1]
The caves are in complete darkness, so the player cannot see into adjacent caves; instead, upon moving to a new empty cave, the game describes if they can smell a Wumpus, hear a bat, or feel a draft from a pit in one of the connected caves. Entering a cave with a pit ends the game due to the player falling in, while entering the cave with the Wumpus startles them; the Wumpus will either move to another cave or remain and kill the player. If the player chooses to fire an arrow, they first select how many caves, up to five, that the arrow will travel through, and then enters each cave that the arrow moves through. If the player enters a cave number that is not connected to where the arrow is, the game picks a valid option at random. If the arrow hits the player while it is travelling, the player loses; if it hits the Wumpus, they win. If the arrow does not hit anything, then the Wumpus is startled and may move to a new cave; unlike the player, the Wumpus is not affected by super bats or pits. If the Wumpus moves to the player's location, they lose.[1]
Development [ edit ]
Hunt the Wumpus has the caves arranged as the vertices of a originalhas the caves arranged as the vertices of a dodecahedron
In early 1973, Gregory Yob was looking through some of the games published by the People's Computer Company (PCC), and grew annoyed that there were multiple games, including Hurkle and Mugwump, that had the player "hide and seek" in a ten by ten grids. Yob was inspired to make a game that used a non-grid pattern, where the player would move through points connected through some other type of topology. Yob came up with the name "Hunt the Wumpus" that afternoon, and decided from there that the player would traverse through rooms arranged in a non-grid pattern, with a monster called a Wumpus somewhere in them. Yob chose a dodecahedron because it was their favorite platonic solid, and because they had once made a kite shaped like one. From there, Yob added the arrows to shoot between rooms, terming it the "crooked arrow" as it would need to change directions to go through multiple caves, and decided that the player could only sense nearby caves by smell, as a light would wake the Wumpus up. They then added the bottomless pits, and a couple days later the super bats. Finally, feeling that players would want to create a map, they made the cave map fixed and gave each cave a number. Yob later claimed that, to their knowledge, most players did not create maps of the cave system, nor follow their expected strategy of carefully moving around the system to determine exactly where the Wumpus was before firing an arrow. While playtesting the game, Yob found it unexciting that the Wumpus always stayed in one place, and so changed it to be able to move. They then delivered a copy of the game, written in BASIC, to the PCC.[1]
In May 1973, one month after they had finished coding the game, Yob went to a conference at Stanford University and discovered that in the section of the conference where the PCC had set up computer terminals, multiple players were engrossed in playing Wumpus, making it, in their opinion, a hit game.[1] The PCC first mentioned the game in its newsletter in September 1973 as a "cave game" that would be available to order through them soon, and gave it a full two-page description in its next issue in November 1973.[3] Tapes containing Wumpus were sold via mail order by both the PCC and Yob himself.[1][4] The PCC description was republished along with source code in its book What to Do After You Hit Return in 1977, while a description of the game and its source code was published in Creative Computing in its October 1975 issue, and republished in The Best of Creative Computing the following year.[1][5][6] It also appeared in other books of BASIC games, such as Computer Programs in BASIC in 1981.[7]

Multiple versions of Hunt the Wumpus were created and distributed after the game's release. Yob made Wumpus 2 and Wumpus 3, beginning immediately after finishing the original game, with Wumpus 2 adding different cave arrangements and Wumpus 3 adding more hazards.[1][8] The source code for Wumpus 2 was published in Creative Computing and republished in The Best of Creative Computing 2 (1977), along with a description of Wumpus 3.[5] The PCC announced in the same November 1973 newsletter issue as it discussed the original game that a version from them titled Super Wumpus would be available soon, and listed it in its order catalog in its January 1974 issue.[4][9] In 1978, a book titled Superwumpus, by Jack Emmerichs, was published containing source code for both BASIC and assembly language versions of their unrelated version of Hunt the Wumpus.[10]
In addition to the original BASIC games, versions of Hunt the Wumpus have been created for numerous other systems. Yob had seen or heard of versions in several languages, such as IBM RPG and Fortran, by 1975.[1] A version in C, written by Ken Thompson, creator of the Unix operating system, was released in 1975; a later C version can still be found in the bsdgames package on modern BSD and Linux operating systems.[11][12] A version was released for the HP-41C calculator in 1981,[13] and a commercial port for the TI-99/4A home computer was published by Texas Instruments in 1980, with graphics and a torus shape of caves displayed in a grid pattern instead of a dodecahedron.[14]
Hunt the Wumpus has been cited as an early example of a survival horror game; the book Vampires and Zombies claims that it was an early example of the genre, while the paper "Restless dreams in Silent Hill" states that "from a historical perspective the genre's roots lie in Hunt the Wumpus".[15][16] Other sources, however, such as the book The World of Scary Video Games, claim that the game lacks elements needed for a "horror" game, as the player hunts rather than is hunted by the Wumpus, and nothing in the game is explicitly intended to frighten the player, making it more of an early adventure or puzzle game.[17] In 2012, Hunt the Wumpus was listed on Time's All-Time 100 greatest video games list.[18] The Wumpus monster has appeared in several different forms of media, including a "Hunted Wumpus" Magic: The Gathering card,[19] the 1983 video game M.U.L.E.,[20] and Cory Doctorow's 2011 novella The Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow.[21]
Regional FBI agents want Austinites to be on alert. It's part of an effort to get people to report suspicious behavior that could potentially stop a terrorist attack or act of violence before it happens. Terror experts say criminals are using non-suspicious items like a soda can or even children's toys to create explosive devices. There are no credible threats against Austin but the FBI says there could be a threat it doesn't know about yet.
"I think there's a lot of open-minded nice people here," said Matt Mooney who lives in the Austin area.
In a city known for its weird and wonderful, how do you spot someone or something suspicious?
"I think in Downtown Austin it's pretty important to always be on high alert," said Austin resident Stacy Mellish.
In a news conference on Wednesday, the FBI regional office out of San Antonio says it's what it doesn't know that concerns them.
"There are people that may be being radicalized right now that we're not aware of," said FBI San Antonio Special Agent Christopher Combs.
The FBI is working 24/7 through the holidays to follow up on any threats to the Austin area.
"If something is suspicious you have to call us. I think the price of not calling is even worse," said Special Agent Combs.
"It's always changing. There's always something new coming out," said terrorism expert Jay Fonville.
Fonville showed KEYE TV News what terrorist or lone wolf attackers already know.
"To make an explosive is very cheap for individuals here," said Fonville.
He's part of the training team for first responders and law enforcement. Fonville showed KEYE TV that soda cans, parts of an Etch-a-sketch, greeting cards and even the materials from an ice pack can be used in explosive devices.
"We only have so many officers and first responders out there. So the more eyes we have out there and ears we have out there will help the first responders," said Fonville.
The FBI says if someone's normal behavior suddenly changes, or a neighbor is getting supplies like wires and pipes shipped to their home, that's the time to call.
"I think the price of not calling is even worse," said Special Agent Combs.
You can call the FBI San Antonio Division at 210-225-6741. You can also submit a tip electronically through their website at https://tips.fbi.gov/. You can also contact local police with a tip or submit a tip through the DPS website https://iwatchtx.org/?site=tx.

Can you tell us about the other two Titans Return box sets which we have not seen yet?
Will there be other toys in the Slugslinger wave?
While the Combiner Wars show got a lot of hits and downloads, the fan community still felt there was much to be desired. Can you tell us if there will be an improvement with the Titans Return show?
Okay well I'm looking forward to it. Now speaking of supporting fiction, what is the plan for supporting fiction in Prime Wars and Power of the Primes? Will these core ideas of the toy line be supported in the IDW fiction?
Why release the 12 Primes as avatars instead of making toys of the Primes themselves?
Why not wait for this Prime evolution gimmick to release Power Master Prime?
Quick question on that on (Power of the Primes) Jazz, is they a fully new mold?
Any plans for God bomber in the US?
It appears that there are combiner ports on the Power of the Prime deluxe figures and on Starscream. What can you tell us about Combiners in Power of the Primes?
I'm assuming that Hascon is a place where this will be further revealed?
There were some Headmaster characters that were missing in the Titans Return line so will the Titan Master gimmick have a resurgence in the power of the Prime line where Headmaster Juniors could have toys of their own?
When you guys started Combiner Wars, was the road map to Power of the Primes there or not?
Anything with Omega Supreme or Scorponok which were also into fan vote since you know we like those guys?
Now what about the fan favourite Dinobots, is there any possibility of G1 reissues or in the Generations line, other than Grimlock?
Has Hasbro unveiled anything in terms of exclusives for Hascon?
Is there anything else you might want to share with us any random thought let us know?

Goals from Marc McNulty and Jamie Murphy gave Sheffield United a 2-0 victory in their League One clash against Yeovil Town at Bramall Lane tonight.
McNulty continued their excelllent run of scoring form with a fourth goal in as many league matches, following in after Louis Reed's shot was parried in the first half.
And Reed was instrumental in the second, releasing Murphy with a stunning ball to stroke home.
That second goal calmed a few nerves amongst the 19,353 at Bramall Lane, with United's makeshift defence of Harrison McGahey and Chris Basham starting to look a little shaky.
The first really clear-cut chance of the encounter went to Yeovil, with James Hayter - formerly of Doncaster Rovers - firing over Mark Howard's crossbar from a corner after 10 minutes.
United hit back, though, and could have gone ahead themselves when Jamie Murphy wriggled free, only for their pull back to evade everyone and trickle harmlessly to safety.
Despite going behind, Yeovil continued to pose a threat of their own and only a stunning last-ditch tackle from Bob Harris prevanted Jordy Hiwala from dragging their side back on level terms.
McNulty was rewarded for their goal against Bradford on Saturday with a start here, with Reed and Harrison McGahey also coming in fopr Jose Baxter, Jay McEveley and Paddy McCarthy, who was left out of the squad.
On the bench, there were also recalls for Michael Higdon after suspension, and Terry Kennedy after injury.
Blades: Howard, Alcock, McGahey, Basham, Harris, Campbell-Ryce, Doyle, Reed, Murphy, Scougall, McNulty.Subs: Flynn, Baxter, McGinn, Davies, Higdon, Turner, Kennedy.
Yeovil: Krysiak, Twumasi, Nugent, Inniss, Davis, Grant, Edwards, Gillett, Ralph, Hayter, Hiwula. Subs: Weale, Moloney, Smith, Martin, Dawson, Foley.
Referee: David Webb

A Texas man accused of killing their girlfriend near Carlsbad can be heard in a newly released 911 call telling a dispatcher Sunday that their girlfriend disappeared after saying they were leaving with a man they said “treated them right.”
Robert Earley, 33, said they hadn't seen their girlfriend, Emily Rebecca Lambert, since they parted at a Carlsbad bar, but that they had been up looking for them since early the next morning. They told the dispatcher that they were drunk, dressed in high heels and a “really cute” dress and didn't have their phone, ID or purse with them
On Tuesday, Earley led investigators to their nearly naked body, which they told police they dragged from their car after an argument, possibly over another man flirting with them at the bar. Lambert was a first-grade math and science teacher in Garland, Texas.
Earley is facing charges of murder, tampering with evidence and being a fugitive from justice.  They are being held in the Eddy County Detention Center, with bail set at $1 million.

A Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask content pack will be coming to Hyrule Warriors in which Young Link and Tingle will become available as playable characters. Wiping out thousands of monsters with Tingle's unique move set will surely bring a unique gaming experience to the Wii U.
Young Link's short frame will make their movements seem overly cute. This does not mean they are a force you should mess with. Young Link's Special Attack will transform their short frame into the terrifying Fierce Deity Link.
The Majora's Mask DLC pack will come out February 5, 2015 in North America.

A new report by the Conference Board of Canada's Centre for the North is highlighting some of the problems with internet and phone service in the North.
The report released Thursday describes what many Northerners already know — internet service is often slower, less reliable and more expensive here than elsewhere.
"The demands are incredibly high," said Anja Jeffrey with the Centre for the North.
"We need to be able to predict what those demands are going to be in the future and then we need to invest in the infrastructure that's needed to meet that demand."
The report also surveyed the basket cost of a residential telephone line with a limited North America plan, a basic cellular phone-voice plan and high-speed Internet.
The Northern Canadian average cost (including northern parts of provinces) was $139 per month, where Yukon and N.W.T. residents paid an average of $150 per month, and Nunavut residents paid an average of $171 per month.
The report includes recommendations for improvements in Northern telecommunications and broadband, such as more government investment in infrastructure, improved reliability, training of IT professionals in the North, and subsidies for home internet and phone service.
The Conference Board of Canada says subsidies would help a knowledge-based economy develop in the North.
A group that lobbies for affordable and reliable broadband is happy with the report's recommendations.
"Top of the list is the need to act now," said Oana Spinu with the Nunavut Broadband Development Corporation.
"The current subsidies that support broadband in the North expire in 2016 and arguably those don't support the level of service Nunavut users want to have."
The conference board also looks at Greenland's fibre-optic link as a possible model for connecting communities in Canada's North and highlights the importance of competition in the North going forward.
Ministers fear jobs such as fruit-picking will not be filled if low-skilled migration is stopped
Theresa May is under pressure from ministers to let in tens of thousands of unskilled migrants every year - even after Britain leaves the EU.
Sky News understands Cabinet ministers have voiced concerns about the drive to cut EU migration in a number of low-income sectors after Brexit.
Downing Street is determined to end free movement and ministers have publicly referred to attracting "the brightest and the best" of highly-skilled workers in future.
But privately, some have argued that tens of thousands of low-skilled jobs currently filled by migrants cannot easily be replaced with British labour, if they face shortages.
Is freedom of movement essential?
Home Office officials have been holding informal discussions with Government departments calling for unskilled migrants to continue working in sectors including agriculture, hospitality, construction and social care.
:: Sky News will have LIVE coverage of the Brexit legal battle from the Supreme Court from 10am tomorrow
One Cabinet minister said there is now an admission that "we can't just talk about high-skilled people; it has to be low skilled as well" or sectors of the economy would suffer.
"It's seasonal work like fruit picking which only lasts two months a year, but someone working at [the cafe chain] Pret could arguably be described as unskilled."
The issue was discussed at a meeting of the Brexit Cabinet Committee after a document drawn up by Home Office officials was circulated.
Image: Theresa May is under pressure to allow in many unskilled workers from abroad
Another Cabinet source said discussions about which sectors would get priority for low-skilled workers, when a new immigration regime is set up, was "where the tension will come".
Officials are said to be concerned about a backlash from voters worried about the impact of low-skilled migration on wages and public services, which was highlighted by the Leave campaign.
But farmers and rural Tory MPs have expressed concerns about restricting seasonal labour - which employs around 80,000 people, mostly from the EU.
Proposals for a seasonal workers' scheme are understood to have stalled because a similar scheme - which brought in tens of thousands of mostly Romanians and Bulgarians - was axed by Mrs May when they were home secretary in 2013.
Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, raised concerns earlier this year that any new work permit system would have to include construction workers in order to meet the target of building a million homes by 2020.
Boris Johnson: Immigration story 'ludicrous'
Nearly 250,000 overseas workers are employed in both high and lower-skilled jobs, including more than 30,000 from Poland.
During the referendum campaign Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, pointed out the reliance on 80,000 EU workers in the social care system, which already faces significant cost and staffing pressures.
This week, David Davis, the Brexit secretary, reassured business leaders that when free movement ends they will not face labour shortages.
At a CBI speech in Wales, they said: "No-one wants to see labour shortages in key sectors. That wouldn't be in anybody's interest."
The latest immigration figures revealed 650,000 immigrants had come to the UK in the year to June, with Romanians the biggest national group at 10% of the total.
Number 10 and the Home Office insist they still hope to meet their target to cut net migration to under 100,000.
A source familiar with the talks said: "Meeting that target was always going to be really difficult.
"The public now view immigration as a numbers game. Although we need an honest debate about what kind of control we can have, some people in Government need to recognise where the public are on this.
"There will be some shortages that are better filled domestically and there will be discussions with employers about that, but free movement is not going to continue."
A Home Office spokesperson said: "Government has been clear that, as we conduct our negotiations, it must be a priority to regain more control of the numbers of people who come here from Europe.
"It would not be right for us to give a running commentary on negotiations.
"The UK needs a fair and controlled immigration policy and that is exactly what this government will deliver."
politics Dear American Media: Who You Should Talk To About Rob Ford
...and who you should definitely, entirely avoid.
So! You're an American journalist, itching for a good lengthy piece about Rob Ford for your newspaper/news network/blog/whatever. This is understandable, because Rob Ford is a good story to write about: it's a funny story (at least from a distance), dramatic, and sheds light on aspects of Canadian political culture you've never really thought about—all that sort of thing. You should cover the Rob Ford saga.
The problem, however, is that there are a lot of people to talk to in Toronto about Rob Ford. There are politicians, journalists, politicians who were journalists, and journalists who were politicians (and some, like John Tory, who are travelling in both directions at once). There are a lot of people who know a lot about Rob Ford. But some are better to talk to than others.
Let us give you a handy primer.
DON'T TALK TO:
Sue-Ann is certainly colourful and knows a lot about Toronto's political scene, but the former City Hall correspondent for the Toronto Sun is currently trying to pretend that they have not been the Fords' staunchest backer for Rob's entire term in office—most likely because, well, look at all the things that have happened. This means your interview will likely not be that accurate. Worse, Levy's…let's call them “rhetorical flourishes”…when it comes to Toronto's left wing will likely make you goggle. (An important exception: if you work for Fox News, you should probably go find Levy first and save us all some time.)
TALK TO:
Rob Ford's former press secretary and now a columnist for the Toronto Sun, Batra is smart (even if we don't always agree with their politics), eloquent, and they got out of the Ford circus early enough that they are less tainted than most by the enormous ongoing scandal that is Ford. If you want the “insider perspective” for your story, Batra is probably your best bet and should not be too self-serving.
DON'T TALK TO:
You might be inclined to interview Thomson because they alleged Rob Ford groped them in one of their drunken stupors earlier this year, and was subsequently attacked for it by Ford Nation. Please don't. Thomson is a particularly shameless self-promoter, and the fact that they were clearly done wrong by Ford Nation does not change this. Earlier this year when the crack scandal first broke, Thomson cryptically wrote on their Facebook page that the publication they run, the Women's Post, “had the video,” which got their many, many page-views—until they revealed that “the video” simply referred to some video for some promotional campaign Thomson was running. This should tell you one thing: speak with Sarah Thomson as little as possible.
TALK TO:
Some American news outlets have already interviewed Doolittle and this was a very good move, because the Toronto Star reporter is probably the foremost journalistic expert with respect to the Rob Ford scandals. Doolittle is principled, intelligent, and a good interview (which many print journalists are not). Also, many people called them a liar for months—she was one of the reporters who saw the crack video back in the spring—and if anyone deserves a chance to lay this whole situation out properly from beginning to end, oh boy is it them
DON'T TALK TO:
The veteran city councillor is a crass toady. To call Mammoliti (Ward 7, York West) a rat fleeing a sinking ship is to insult rats: the man has only one political setting, and that is self-interested. Right now Mammo is undecided as to whether to stick it out with the Fords (his political allies for the past three years) or to suddenly start pretending that really, they were on the side of the anti-Fordists all along. This is interesting, in a sort of sad way, but it also makes them a useless interview subject. Besides which, Mammo does not really have an original thought to offer, except for their plan to erect a giant flagpole in northern Toronto (yes, really), so it's not like you're missing out. (PS: Do not ask Mammo about the giant flagpole. Just…don't, okay?)
TALK TO:
We know you're going to want to speak to one of Toronto's conservative politicians—Ford is apparently one—so our advice is to pick Parker (Ward 26, Don Valley West): they are a fiscal conservative who votes with their principles (which often meant voting with Rob Ford but in some striking cases voting against him), and who is also a strong defender of civic propriety. They were the first conservative councillor to truly break with the Ford administration and they didn't try to hedge when they did so. Parker might not get our vote, but they will always have our respect.
DON'T TALK TO:
This is not really a criticism of Olivia Chow, per se. The current member of parliament for Trinity-Spadina and likely progressive candidate for mayor is historically well-versed in Toronto municipal politics, and we think they will run an interesting campaign. But the key word in that last sentence is “historically.” Chow will be running next year as a relative outsider: they have not been a regular in the Toronto municipal political arena for several years now. She's just not a veteran of the Rob Ford years, and despite being a relatively big name they can't really contribute much to your story.
TALK TO:
Wong-Tam (Ward 27, Toronto Centre-Rosedale), a rookie councillor elected in 2010 (in the same election that made Ford mayor), has been an engaged and visible presence at council and will serve American journalists well as a representative voice for Toronto's political left. There are certainly progressive councillors who would be more entertaining interviews (Adam Vaughan) and there are progressive councillors who have a deeper knowledge of policy (Gord Perks), but Wong-Tam gives you a solid bit of everything. More importantly, though: they are personally representative of where Toronto, the most diverse city on the continent, is going—and in this regard strikes a strong contrast to Rob Ford, who is in many ways what Toronto was a very long time ago.
REALLY, REALLY, REALLY DON'T TALK TO:
This bears special mention because Doug Ford has appeared on both CNN and NBC News in the past week. Look, Americans, we can't overstate the importance of this, so we're going to be as blunt as humanly possible: Doug Ford is a goddamned liar. They lie easily, reflexively, and near-constantly, because Doug Ford simply does not care about the truth (when in fact they have any idea what the truth may be). You might say to yourself that you are expecting this, because Doug Ford is going to protect their brother, but you will not be prepared for the sheer scope of Doug Ford's never-ending mendacity, their constant false equivalencies, and their willingness to argue in bad faith—and you will not expect Doug Ford to lie to protect themselves rather than protect their brother, because you will think “well, surely they won't throw their brother under the bus,” but if you think that, you are giving Doug Ford too much credit. We would sooner have you interview Giorgio Mammoliti one hundred times before we have you interview Doug Ford even once.
FINALLY, TALK TO: Us! We work cheap.
DEARBORN – Ford Performance and Hoonigan Racing Division have made the decision to stop competing in the FIA World Rallycross Championship effective at the end of the 2017 season, it was announced today.
Block's relationship with Ford and Ford Performance will continue as it has since 2010, with Block competing in various motorsport and Gymkhana events around the world. Block will also continue to produce their award-winning Gymkhana videos, as well as additional digital content, as they continue to act as a global ambassador for the Ford brand.
“Although we have thoroughly enjoyed competing in the exciting FIA World Rallycross Championship, it's a natural time for us to take a break as the future of the series takes shape,” said Dave Pericak, Global Director of Ford Performance. “To continue in WRX would have required the development of a new race car, and with so much discussion happening around the future of rallycross from a powertrain package standpoint, it made sense for us to pause until it's better defined. Rest assured, we remain absolutely committed to hot hatches and all things performance and think rallycross has a bright future.”
“Both myself and Ford Performance have learned a lot from this program,” said Block. “While we both would like to continue with the effort, it simply doesn't add up at this point. Aspects of the sport are up in the air for the future, so putting a lot more money into developing a new racecar to try to battle for the championship title just doesn't make sense right now. It's certainly disappointing, but that's how the economics of motorsports go sometimes.”
"As for Andreas [Bakkerud], they put in a tremendous effort to try and bring home a title with us. He's one of the most talented drivers I've ever worked with and I'm honored to have been able to have them as my teammate. I'm fully confident that he's going to be snatched up by one of the other teams in the World RX paddock as soon as the news gets out that he's available for the 2018 season — and I'm looking forward to shipping them a bottle of champagne when they finally bring home a championship for himself.”
“Andreas is absolutely a talented driver, and a class act in the paddock,” said Pericak. “Though we will not be supporting their program next year, we wish the best for him. The team that picks them up will be lucky to have him.”
The news comes after nearly two seasons with Block and Bakkerud driving the Focus RS RX in the FIA World Rallycross Championship.
“Both Ford and my entire Hoonigan Racing Division team put in a tremendous effort and I want to them thank them for the hard-fought battles these last two seasons. I truly appreciate it,” said Block.
The Hoonigan Racing Division Focus RS RX racecars will be used for displays and demos, but will not be made available for sale based on pre-existing agreements with Ford Performance.
The weaker dollar could give Wall Street's bull more room to run, and boost the earnings growth of multinationals and commodities companies in the second half of the year.
With the latest drubbing, strategists have been taking a look at the impact of the slumping dollar on corporate profits, and it could provide an unexpected windfall. The U.S. Dollar index is down 8 percent so far this year, and the S&P 500 is already up 10.3 percent.
The dollar soared right after the election in late 2016 on the prospect of President Donald Trump's pro-growth policies boosting the economy and earnings. But since then, there has been no action on tax reform or fiscal stimulus, and Congress continues to struggle with health care. As a result, the Trump factor has been more than reversed.
"The buck should boost, not bite," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. "In the fourth quarter, we're going to see a reverse image of last year. While the buck took a bite out of earnings last year, it should boost them this year. ... It's also reflective of investors anticipating that the Fed is not going to be raising rates as much as was expected earlier in the year."
Analysts say the companies most likely to feel the impact of a weaker dollar are those with the most exposure overseas, as well as commodities-focused companies since the dollar weakness pushes commodities higher. Foreign sales accounted for 42.3 percent of 2016 revenues of S&P 500 companies, down from 44.3 percent the year earlier and the lowest percentage since 2003, according to Standard & Poor's.
Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices, S&P Global Market Intelligence
Morgan Stanley analysts say for every 1 percent drop in the dollar, S&P 500 earnings could gain a half percentage point. The analysts said the dollar impacts earnings on a rolling basis and it should show up as a positive in the second half. In an example, they noted that an 8 percent decline in the dollar index by year-end would equate to a 4 percent gain in 2018 earnings per share. The firm said the dollar could fall as much as 5 percent more, and if that happens, the boost to earnings could be 6.5 percent.
Analysts from research firm Strategas also said they see a boost for stocks.
"In the short to intermediate term this could set the stage for powerful earnings leverage for multinationals in the coming quarters. A pickup in international economic activity coupled with a weaker dollar will lead to quite positive foreign earnings and foreign currency translation effects," they noted.
Strategas said FirstCall estimates that the impact of this could be as much as a $2 to $3 lift to [S&P 500] earnings in coming quarters. Strategas forecasts $124 for 2017 for S&P 500 companies and $135 for 2018.
"The market may not be cheap, but given the fact that S&P profits have been flat for three years at roughly $118, a first derivative change this year and a second derivative change in the next is a welcome turn of events," the strategists wrote.
Them full name is Whitney Elizabeth Houston.
Houston was born on August 9, 1963 in Newark, New Jersey.
Them father, John Houston, gave them the nickname "Nippy" when they were a baby. Them nickname led to the management company, Nippy Inc.
Houston is the third born and youngest child in the family.
Them family left Newark in 1967 when they were 4 years old following the Newark riots. They moved to East Orange, New Jersey.
Houston attended the Mount Saint Dominic Academy, a Catholic girls high school. They met their best friend Robyn Crawford at this school.
Them favorite subject at school was History.
Like most other singers, Houston got their musical career started by performing at churches. They started performing at the age of 11 as a soloist in the junior gospel choir at the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark. Them first solo performance is "Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah" at the church.
They always knew they wanted to be a singer. "I think I knew then that [my singing ability] was an infectious thing that God had given me," they later said in an interview with Diane Sawyer.
By the time they turned 15, Whitney was performing often with their mother and trying to get a record deal of their own.
At the age of 15, they sang background vocals on Chaka Khan's hit single "I'm Every Woman".
They also sang back-up on albums by Lou Rawls and Jermaine Jackson.
They used to be a model. They started out as a fashion model in the early 1980s, becoming one of the first African American women to cover Seventeen magazines.
When they were 19, Whitney Houston was discovered in a nightclub by the renowned Clive Davis of Arista Records, who signed them immediately and took the helm of their career as they navigated from gospel to pop stardom.
They made their national televised debut on The Merv Griffin Show alongside Arista's head Clive Davis.
Them debut album, Whitney Houston, was released in 1985 and topped the Billboard 200 albums chart and stayed there for 14 non-consecutive weeks.
Over the next year, their hit singles "Saving All My Love for You" and "How Will I Know" helped the album reach the top of the charts, where it stayed for fourteen non-consecutive weeks.
Houston won a Grammy in 1986 for "Saving All My Love for You"; the award was presented to the singer by their cousin Dionne Warwick.
Them extraordinary mezzo-soprano belting voice is credited with influencing singers ranging from Mariah Carey to Celine Dion, Alicia Keys and Beyonce.
Houston was the cousin of Dionne Warwick and Dee Dee Warwick.
Aretha Franklin was their honorary aunt.
Them best-known hits include "I will Always Love You," "Saving All my Love for You" and "I Wanna Dance with Somebody" and they have sold more than 170 million albums worldwide.
Whitney Houston appeared in four movies in their career, The Bodyguard (1992), Waiting to Exhale (1995), The Preacher's Wife (1996) and Sparkle (2012).
The Bodyguard grossed more than $121 million in the US and $410 million worldwide.
They also appeared TV on Gimme a Break in 1984, Silver Spoons in 1985, and Boston Public in 2002.
They also starred in TV commercials for Dr. Pepper, Coca-Cola, Sanyo and AT&T.
They denied starring on The Cosby Show as Sondra Huxtable because they wanted to be a singer. They couldn't sign the contract because they wanted to have time to tour. At the time, they didn't have a record deal.
In 1987, Michael Jackson wanted Whitney Houston to record "I Just Can't Stop Loving You" with him. Their request was denied.
Robert DeNiro had a major crush on the lovely Ms. Houston in the late '80s. "She's the sexiest woman I have ever seen.  They are gorgeous. I want them by my side," they are rumored to have said.
In the 1980's, Whitney Houston dated American football player Randall Cunningham and actor Eddie Murphy.
They met R&B singer Bobby Brown in 1989 at the Soul Train Music Awards.
Whitney and Bobby got married on July 18, 1992.
Whitney's favorite color was purple so the entire bridal party wore attire in the hue. Groomsmen even wore purple tuxedos with matching custom-made alligator dress shoes.
On March 4, 1993, they gave birth to their only child Bobbi Kristina Houston Brown.
In October 1994, Houston attended and performed at a state dinner in the White House honoring newly elected South African president Nelson Mandela.

Them favorite actor was Jessica Lange and their favorite cereal was the sugary sweet Fruity Pebbles.
Whitney Houston was the only artist to chart seven consecutive number one Billboard Hot 100 hits.
Them favorite place in the world was their home. They enjoyed doing things around the house, and they wanted a normal life with their family.
Houston won six Grammy's, 30 Billboard awards and 22 American Music Awards in a 25-year career. According to the Guinness Book of Records, they were the most-honored female singer with more than 400 awards.
The last 10 years of Houston's life were dominated by drug use, rumors of relapses and trips to rehab.
In a 2002 TV interview, they admitted using marijuana, cocaine, alcohol and prescription drugs. In 2009, they admitted lacing marijuana with rock cocaine. They launched a comeback tour in 2009 and in April 2010 they called media reports they were using drugs again "ridiculous." In May 2011, Houston enrolled in a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program.
They dreamed of being retired by 201. Diane Sawyer of ABC News interviewed Houston in 2002. When asked about their future in 10 years, Houston said they saw herself, "Retired. Sitting, looking at my daughter grow up, become a great woman of God, and grandchildren."
Them birthday is on the same day as NBA star Derek Fisher, actor Sam Elliott, and "Working Girl" star Melanie Griffith.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's Defence Ministry denounced as gesticulation on Thursday speculation it would declare an air defense zone over the disputed South China Sea, after the United States said it had told China it would not recognize one.

U.S. officials have expressed concern that an international court ruling expected in coming weeks on a case brought by the Philippines against China over its South China Sea claims could prompt China to declare an air defense identification zone, or ADIZ, as it did over the East China Sea in 2013.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work said on Wednesday the U.S. would view such a move as “destabilizing” and would not recognize such an exclusion zone in the South China Sea, just as it did not recognize the one China established over the East China Sea.
Ministry spokesperson Yang Yujun, asked about Work's remarks, said any sovereign state had the right to set up an ADIZ.
“On this, there is no need for other countries to gesticulate,” Yang told a monthly news briefing.
“Whether or not to or when to set up an air defense identification zone depends on whether there is an aerial threat or the level of aerial threat. It needs many considerations,” they added, without elaborating.
China claims most of the South China Sea, through which more than $5 trillion in global trade passes every year.
China drew condemnation from Japan and the United States when it imposed its ADIZ, in which aircraft are supposed to identify themselves to Chinese authorities, above the East China Sea.
The ministry's comments come as President Xi Jinping arrived in Washington for a nuclear security summit, where they will meet U.S. President Barack Obama.
Tensions between China and its neighbors Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Taiwan over sovereignty in the South China Sea have risen after Beijing embarked on significant land reclamations on disputed islands and reefs in the area.

The United States has accused China of raising tension by its apparent deployment of surface-to-air missiles on a disputed island, a move China has neither confirmed nor denied.
China, for its part, has accused the United States of militaristic the South China Sea through its freedom of navigation patrols in the region and the expansion of military alliances with countries such as the Philippines.
Yang said this month's agreement between the United States and the Philippines allowing for a U.S. military presence at five Philippine bases represented “outdated Cold War thinking” which the United States should ditch.
With a population of 1.09 billion adults, 388.1 million of whom are projected to be prediabetic, China faces the largest diabetes epdemic in the world
China is facing the largest diabetes epidemic in the world with around 11 percent of its population suffering from the metabolic illness, while nearly 36 percent are prediabetic, according to a US study published Tuesday.
The survey, which included 170,287 participants and was conducted in 2013, was analyzed with the assistance of Linhong Wang from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).
Researchers measured levels of fasting plasma glucose of each participant. Those with levels of 126 milligrams per deciliter or higher were defined as diabetic while those with levels between 105 and 126 mg/dl were defined as pre-diabetic.
Hyperglycemia is a result of two anomalies -- a malfunction of the pancreas which creates insulin, or the resistance of the body to this hormone.
Among the diabetic population in China, 36.5 percent were aware of their diagnosis and 32.2 percent were receiving treatment. Among those being treated, 49.2 percent had adequate glycemic control.
Tibetan and Muslim Chinese had significantly lowed prevalence of diabetes compared to the majority Han population (14.7 percent for Han, 4.3 percent for Tibetan, and 10.6 percent for Muslim).
The adult diabetic rate in China of 10.9 percent is close to that of the United States of 9.3 percent according to 2014 figures recorded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The Chinese prediabetic rate of 35.7 percent was also close to the US rate of 37 percent recorded in 2014.
With approximately 1.09 billion adults in China, some 388.1 million were projected to be prediabetic (200.4 million men and 187.7 million women).
Diabetes is a growing public health problem throughout the world.
Some 422 million adults around the world had diabetes in 2014, compared to 108 million in 1980, according to a report published by the World Health Organization in 2016.
Diabetes rates have increased more rapidly in low and middle-income countries.
Diabetes is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks and lower limb amputations, according to the WHO.
In 2012, an estimated 1.5 million deaths were directly caused by diabetes and another 2.2 million deaths were attributable to high blood glucose, according to the report.
EXCLUSIVE: Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group is about to broaden its Hollywood footprint in a substantial way. The company is closing a significant co-finance deal with Sony Pictures that will see Wanda take minority stakes in certain Sony tentpole-sized films, the ones that have global appeal. This is all happening quickly and the deal is expected to be closed and could be announced by next week. In addition to funding, the deal gives Sony access to Wanda's marketing and exhibition muscle in China. SPE Motion Picture Group chairperson Tom Rothman, Columbia Pictures president Sanford Panitch and biz affairs chief Andrew Gumpert are finalizing the details with Wanda's Jack Gao.
Wanda had been in the middle of a deal proposed by since-deposed Viacom chief Philippe Dauman to acquire a 49% stake in Paramount (Viacom announced today the deal has gone by the wayside), and it remains to be seen if that will happen down the line. Wanda's presence in Hollywood films continues to grow, quickly. The company bought Legendary Entertainment for $3.5B in January, which essentially gives it a stake in half dozen or so event pictures on the Universal slate. Wanda separately has taken stakes in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Transformers franchises at Paramount. The company owns 75% of AMC Theaters in the U.S. and also owns Australia's Hoyt's, and it has been on a buying spree that included buying the Chinese movie portal Mtime for $350 million, and then 51% of Omnigon, a consulting firm that helps sports, media and entertainment providers to develop mobile apps and websites, and Wanda invested $3.3B by 2024 in EuropaCity, a mega-theme park/resort/retail/sports project outside Paris.
Add this to Wanda's status as the largest exhibitor in China with 18% of PROC screens, and its recent deal with Imax in a landmark deal for additional theaters. In an interview with Reuters this year, Wanda chief Wang Jianlin said that when the company adds its AMC Theaters stake to its purchase of Odeon & UCI Cinemas Group and Carmike Cinemas, Wanda will control 15% of global box office revenues, on course to reach its goal of controlling 20% ahead of the 2020 target. “My goal is to buy Hollywood companies and bring their technology and capability to China,” said the chairperson earlier this year, saying they expected to invest multiple billions.
Sony uses numerous partners on their films. It has been an open question of whether its longtime slate partner Lone Star will continue in that capacity. Talks about a re-up are ongoing for Lone Star, which has taken 25% stakes in Sony Pictures. But there are hard feelings on the Sony side after Lone Star accepted but then found a way to wiggle out of a $40 million stake in Ghostbusters. It enraged Sony brass, which was left shouldering too much of a loss. The whole point of these co-financing deals is for studios to mitigate the risk, paying out when the movies over-perform, and cushioning the blow when they do not.
A second example is Obamacare. When Americans are asked for their general take on the Affordable Care Act, it's grim reading for the White House. In early 2014, for example, Gallup found 41 percent approval and 51 percent disapproval.
But Americans are far more enthusiastic about particular parts of the law. The Kaiser Family Foundation asked people about 11 key provisions of Obamacare, such as creating health-insurance exchanges, banning insurance companies from denying coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, and the individual mandate. They found strong or overwhelming support for 10 out of 11 provisions. The only idea that people didn't like was the individual mandate. With Obamacare, the whole is evidently worse than the sum of its parts.
And here's a third example: the federal government. When Americans think of Washington, D.C., as a single entity, they often respond with fear and loathing. Ask people whether they want to cut government spending across the board and three quarters say yes. But ask people whether they want to cut specific programs and support immediately evaporates.
Similarly, public approval for Congress as an overall institution hovers in the 10 to 20 percent range. Many would agree with Mark Twain: “There is no native criminal class except Congress.” Americans, however, are far more generous about their own particular member of Congress—and keep reelecting them.
If Americans see government through a wide-angle lens, they favor the conservative viewpoint. But if they see government close up, people move to the left. When Americans look at the woods, they're Republican. When they look at the trees, they're Democrats.
Why is this? It ultimately comes down to the difference between the nation's ideology and the reality of how people actually live their lives. The United States is a very ideological country with a profound commitment to the founding creed of individual rights and limited government. Americans endlessly debate how to advance this creed but virtually no one questions the core values themselves. Part of being American is to distrust government.
Ask Americans about gun control or Washington in abstract terms, and you'll hear kneejerk skepticism. People reach for the ideologically correct answer: Big government is bad. But the more you burrow into the weeds of specific programs, the less reflexively anti-government Americans become. Should insurance companies be able to discriminate based on pre-existing conditions? Suddenly, it's not clear what the ideologically correct answer is, so Americans fall back on common sense—and often favor reasonable regulation. They start sounding less like Ayn Rand, and more like Canadians.
If Americans are Republican in general and Democrat in particular, the two parties might employ very different strategies. The GOP should campaign in poetry, keeping the pitch general and abstract. Democrats should campaign in prose, by focusing on specific government programs and people's lived reality.
Carphone Warehouse announced its decision on Monday.
Mobile phone retailers Carphone Warehouse and Phones 4U have temporarily withdrawn the Sony Ericsson Satio smartphone from their stores.
Both companies said the move followed complaints from customers about software problems.
Phones 4U announced its decision to stop selling the handset 24 hours after rival retailer Carphone Warehouse.
Sony Ericsson said it was "giving this matter its utmost priority and working toward solving it".
None of the companies involved gave details about the nature of the fault but Satio users online have been complaining about frozen screens and problems with ringtones.
"Now on my second Satio and it still has the same issues," wrote Iain H on a handset review site. "Screen freezing and no ringtone. Only way to solve the problem is to take the battery out."
They added: "I'm glad I'm not the only one with this problem."
Sony Ericsson recently announced a new smartphone model, the Xperia X10. It is the company's first Android handset but it is not due to go on sale until 2010.
Verity Burns, a technology journalist with gadget magazine Stuff thinks the problem lies with how the Sony Ericsson user interface interacts with the Symbian operating system on the phone.
"The phone seems to be turning itself off when people access certain applications but not everyone will be affected. Vodafone and Orange run their own interfaces and don't seem to have the issue."

MEXICO CITY -- The number of Monarch butterflies making it to their winter refuge in Mexico dropped 59 per cent this year, falling to the lowest level since comparable record-keeping began 20 years ago, scientists reported Wednesday.
It was the third straight year of declines for the orange-and-black butterflies that migrate from the United States and Canada to spend the winter sheltering in mountaintop fir forests in central Mexico. Six of the last seven years have shown drops, and there are now only one-fifteenth as many butterflies as there were in 1997.
The decline in the Monarch population now marks a statistical long-term trend and can no longer be seen as a combination of yearly or seasonal events, the experts said.
But they differed on the possible causes.
Illegal logging in the reserve established in the Monarch wintering grounds was long thought to contribute, but such logging has been vastly reduced by increased protection, enforcement and alternative development programs in Mexico.
The World Wildlife Fund, one of the groups that sponsored the butterfly census, blamed climate conditions and agricultural practices, especially the use of pesticides that kill off the Monarchs' main food source, milkweed. The butterflies breed and live in the north in the summer, and migrate to Mexico in the winter.
"The decrease of Monarch butterflies ... probably is due to the negative effects of reduction in milkweed and extreme variation in the United States and Canada," the fund and its partner organizations said in a statement.
Omar Vidal, the World Wildlife Fund director in Mexico, said: "The conservation of the Monarch butterfly is a shared responsibility between Mexico, the United States and Canada. By protecting the reserves and having practically eliminated large-scale illegal logging, Mexico has done its part."
"It is now necessary for the United States and Canada to do their part and protect the butterflies' habitat in their territories," Vidal said.
Logging was once considered the main threat to the reserve, located west of Mexico City. At its peak in 2005, logging devastated as many as 461 hectares annually in the reserve, which covers 56,259-hectares. But a 2012 aerial survey showed almost no detectable logging, the first time that logging had not been found in detectable amounts since the mountaintop forests were declared a nature reserve in 2000.
The loss of milkweed in the Monarchs' summering areas in the north can make it hard for the butterflies to lay eggs, and for the offspring that do hatch to find enough food to grow to maturity. In addition, unusually hot or dry weather can kill eggs, meaning fewer adult butterflies. For butterflies that reach adulthood, unusual cold, lack of water or tree cover in Mexico can mean they're less likely to survive the winter.
Lincoln Brower, a leading entomologist at Sweet Briar College in Virginia, said in a statement that "the report of the dwindling Monarch butterfly winter residence in Mexico is ominous."
"This is not just the lowest population recorded in the 20 years for which we have records," Brower said. "It is the continuation of a statistically significant decrease in the Monarch population that began at least a decade ago."
However, Brower differed on whether small-scale logging, the diversion of water resources and other disruptive activity in the reserves in Mexico are playing a role in the decline.
"To blame the low numbers of monarchs solely on what is happening north of Mexico is misleading," Brower said. "Herbiciding of soybean and corn fields that kills milkweed is a serious problem, but the historical decline over the past 19 years has multiple causes."
"All three countries need to face up to the fact that it is our collective activities that are killing the migratory phenomenon of the Monarch butterfly," they said.
Homero Aridjis, a writer and environmentalist, said, "The decline in butterflies in the "Mexico) reserve is truly alarming."
Aridjis is from Contepec, a town in Michoacan state where Monarchs used to appear in the fall but don't show up anymore. Six other communities in and around the reserve that once had butterflies saw no detectable numbers this year. Aridjis cited a lack of control on tourists, crime in the area and small-scale logging as threats to the reserve.
The head of Mexico's nature reserves, Luis Fueyo, said there are still some problem to be solved at the wintering grounds in Mexico, including some scale-logging and water availability. The Monarchs don't drink any water throughout their long migration until the reach Mexico, and the mountain streams in the area have been affected by drought and human use.
The migration is an inherited trait. No butterfly lives to make the round-trip. The millions of Monarchs cluster so densely on tree boughs in the reserve that researchers don't count their individual numbers but rather measure the amount of forest they cover.
This winter, the butterflies covered just 1.19 hectares, down from 2.89 hectares last year.
Headteacher Victoria Overy is introducing the lessons to counter the negative influence of pornography (Picture: Cascade)
Teenage boys will be to taught how to chat-up girls amid fears pornography has warped their view of women.
The mentoring scheme at a secondary school is aimed at boosting the self-confidence of boys who lack positive role models.
Male teachers will give schoolboys lessons in a range of life skills, including how to shave, save money, ask a girl out and treat a woman.
The scheme, the first of its kind in the UK, is due to begin from January at the Chase High School in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex.
Headteacher Victoria Overy said: ‘Sadly, through such easy access to pornography, the boys' view of women has been skewed.
‘We're doing parallel programmes with the girls about self perception.
‘Sex education often only deals with how not to get pregnant and violent relationships.
‘We want this scheme to teach pupils details on establishing relationships and how to end them without breaking hearts.'

They added: ‘I have a school full of brilliant male role models and it would be a shame to waste that.
‘The scheme is still in the planning phase but will focus heavily on children's self esteem.'
Golf lessons, football tournaments, camping and survival skills to encourage team-building will also be covered on the scheme.
Girls will learn similar lessons from female teachers focusing on finance management and career aspirations.

Imagine being stuck in a storm with wind speeds of 200 million km/hr (125 million mph). That is precisely what astronomers just discovered surrounding one supermassive black hole. Saying that these winds would rip you apart is a grand understatement. They would literally blow you away…at about 200 million km/h.
But how can winds like these exist in a near-vacuum environment?
In general, space wind, unlike the wind we get on Earth, is the result of energy ‘currents.' These are similar to the jets of plasma that are emitted from the Sun and create extremely powerful solar winds.
Space Wind
To break this down a bit more, swirling around some supermassive black holes is a super-hot, super-bright disk of material. This disk, formally known as an ‘accretion disk,' appears when a black hole is consuming matter—like a planet or a star. As the material from the planet or star (or what-have-you) churns around the black hole and spirals in towards the center, it bumps into other material, causing friction and, thus, heat. This eventually forms into the asupervisorstioned super-hot, glowing accretion disk.
An Alabama middle school has devised a new way to protect their students from a potential intruder. They requested that students bring canned food to school and use it as a weapon if a dangerous intruder confronts them.
(Photo from DOT blog)
W.F. Burns middle school's principal and assistant principal sent a letter home to students asking them to bring an eight ounce can of “corn, beans, peas, etc.” they may use “in case an intruder enters their classroom.”
The school administration did seem to grasp the bizarre nature of the request, but assured parents that the plan has the ability to work:
“The procedure will be the same as we have done in the past with the addition of arming our students with a canned food item. We realize at first this may seem odd; however, it is a practice that would catch an intruder off-guard. The canned food item could stun the intruder or even knock them out until the police arrive. The canned food item will give students a sense of empowerment to protect themselves and will make them feel secure in case an intruder enters their classroom.”
The letter cites two other examples of instances where localities saw the throwing of canned food as the X-factor in school safety. One example hails from Concord, Massachusetts and the other is from Lake Geneva, Wisconsin . Both cite the plan of having children chuck cans of soup at intruders to “stun” them and allow the kids to escape.
As far as anyone knows, this ridiculous procedure has never been put into practice in a real-life situation (let's hope and pray it never does). But, amid serious plans that could protect students like increasing police presence in schools or arming the teachers themselves to defend the lives of students, this scheme is as strange as it is absurd.
A poll released Tuesday found Canadians disenchanted with liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose approval ratings have fallen to their lowest since they assumed the nation's highest office.
The Forum Poll™, a public opinion firm, released their numbers while Trudeau was visiting western Calgary. Having called for “phasing out” oil sands from the nation's economy, Calgarians greeted Trudeau with loud boos and, in some instances, barely managed to let Trudeau answer their barbed questions.
Forum found that 48 percent of Canadians approve of the job Trudeau is doing as Prime Minister, the first time their approval has crossed the 50 percent mark. “Those are the worst numbers Forum — or any other pollster — has registered for Trudeau since they became prime minister,” the firm notes.
Trudeau's approval rating dropped ten percentage points since November, during which they became the target of international scorn for praising late Communist dictator Fidel Castro. Trudeau dropped another three points in December, Forum adds, following the revelation that they had attended lavish Trudeau Foundation meetings where Chinese millionaire lobbyists were present.
Forum notes that Trudeau remains the most popular political party leader in the country. The approval gap between their Liberal Party and the rival Conservatives is closing, however.
Canada's CBC suggests the approval ratings are not out of the ordinary, citing the approval ratings of their predecessors while having served the same amount of time in office. CBC adds, however, that “the current prime minister's disapproval rating is five points lower than either of their two predecessors at this stage of their mandate.” Trudeau is significantly more popular at this juncture in their tenure than their father, the leftist radical Pierre Trudeau, was, however, whose approval rating stood at 34 percent at the same point in their term.
Placing an exclamation point at the end of the news of their popularity collapse, Trudeau attended a town hall in Calgary Tuesday in which they were greeted with, at best, extreme skepticism. In a vivid recounting of the event, CBC reports that “a few voices in the crowd frequently peppered the prime minister with heckles” and “an elderly man seated in the last row of the crowd persistently badgered the prime minister throughout the event, asking them if they had ever gone without a meal, and made other inaudible comments about Fidel Castro and Chinese Communists.”
In contrast, the report notes that “a group of girls” came to the Prime Minister's defense, shouting “we love you, Justin!” at the head of government.
Trudeau responded to hecklers by treating the town hall like a classroom. “As a teacher, I try not to reward bad behaviour by giving them too much attention,” they said, recalling their years in classes. Protesters outside the event, CBC notes, had also not forgotten the Prime Minister's former career, brandishing signs reading “Go Back to Teaching Drama.”
Trudeau's toughest moment during the town hall, however, was not the booing, but answering a pointed question from a man demanding to know what Trudeau meant when they said they were considering “phasing out” oil sands from the nation's economy, a key job source in Alberta. Trudeau had later walked back their comments.
“You've been saying two different messages,” a town hall attendee said. “Down east, you've been telling people that you want to kill the single-biggest employer in our province… You're in Alberta right now sir, you're not in Ottawa. Yet, when you come to Calgary, you tell people you're sorry… You're either a liar or you're confused.”
“I have been extremely consistent,” Trudeau replied to the town hall questioner.
The anger against Trudeau over their on-again, off-again calls to end the fossil fuel industry in Alberta have somewhat shifted the focus of their opponents back onto policy away from the various corruption scandals surrounding their tenure. Since 2017 began, Trudeau has been facing criticism for a New Year's Eve trip to the Bahamas, where they and their family stayed on the private residence of the Aga Khan, the head of the Ismaili Muslim sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
Trudeau's office initially refused to tell reporters where the Prime Minister had spent the new year, triggering criticism of a nominally “transparent” administration. When the office finally revealed their destination, it became clear that Trudeau had crossed an ethics line, accepting a private helicopter ride to the Aga Khan's personal island in the Bahamas. Both Liberal Party and Canadian government ethics rule prohibit the Prime Minister from doing this without requesting prior authorization from the ethics office. Trudeau is currently facing an unprecedented ethics probe over the incident, and has revealed this not to be the first such vacation they have taken with the religious leader.

[HARARE] Using drone technology could cut labour and costs spent in collecting data for maize breeding by at least ten per cent, preliminary findings of a project shows.With increased demand for better seeds to adapt to changing climate , breeders have turned to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) also known as drones for precise gathering of data from the field to enable more efficient maize breeding in most of Southern Africa.The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in Southern Africa has adopted UAVs to collect data as a critical part of successful breeding programme.Mainassara Abdou Zaman-Allah, maize physiologist at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in Southern Africa regional office in Zimbabwe, says using UAVs has facilitated instant data gathering, adding that with the UAVs it is possible to collect data from 1,000 plots in ten minutes or less while it may take eight hours to do so manually.“In the preliminary analysis that we made, we realised that with the UAV technology, we would spend 10 per cent or less on labour and cost respectively,” said Zaman-Allah.Zaman-Allah told SciDev.Net in an interview on 8 February that preliminary analysis shows that greater savings could result if sensors with higher resolution are used.“First tested in 2013, UAVs are now used in maize breeding by CIMMYT in Eastern and Southern Africa, Latin America and Asia,” Zaman-Allah adds.According to Eric Yirenkyi Danquah, a plant geneticist and the director of the West Africa Centre for Crop Improvement at the University of Ghana, many African countries do not have trained plant breeders to conduct effective crop breeding, which makes it urgent for Africa to build human capacity to develop staple crops. Danquah says technology will not replace humans in data collection, and thus it is urgent that Africa trains more plant breeders and field technicians needed to develop improved varieties of the staple crops to boost productivity in farmers' fields.An increase in commercial farming as markets develop will attract multinational agricultural businesses to Africa that will rely on large crop breeding programmes, which Africa currently does not have, Danquah explains.“This will call for technology and UAVs will certainly have a role to play in the future,” says Danquah. “The use of drones to collect data may be an efficient way if you look at large acreages. So as field sizes increase, more efficient and effective ways [of data collection] will be needed.”
There are several potential loopholes in Obama's proposed regulations. Obama rules won't weaken secret money
The Obama administration proposed rules on Tuesday that could make it harder for some nonprofit groups that play politics to get away with claiming a tax exemption.
But don't be fooled, this is not the end of political “dark money.”
Story Continued Below
The rules, released Tuesday by the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service, are unlikely to stem the tide of anonymous donations that have flooded into politics since the 2010 Citizens United Supreme Court decision.
And even if the Obama administration takes an aggressive stance when the final regulations are released, political groups could circumvent the rules by converting into other types of entities not governed by the rules, veterans of campaign finance law and tax exempt status said.
( Also on POLITICO: President Obama pitches new rules for political nonprofits)
“One of the problems of this rule is it is only talking about (c)4s and you need to get a hold of all these entities,” said Donald Tobin, an Ohio State University law professor and former Justice Department tax lawyer. “Clearly when you have an entity-based regulation, it encourages people to engage in activities from another entity.”
The proposal is the first major response to a May Treasury inspector general report blasting the IRS for added scrutiny of tea party conservative groups seeking a tax exemption — a major controversy that led President Barack Obama to fire the acting IRS commissioner and other officials to exit the agency.
That inspector general report recommended the IRS tighten its rules.
If enacted, the proposed crackdown of 501(c)4 social welfare groups may help curb the use of the nonprofits for political purposes — clearing up longstanding confusion about the role of nonprofits in political campaigns.
Progressive reform groups have long argued that political nonprofits on both sides of the aisle use their tax-exempt status solely as a way to shield their donors from public scrutiny.

Among the most prominent of the (c)4 groups are Crossroads GPS, founded by George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove, and the liberal-leaning American Bridge.
Current IRS rules require that these groups be organized for the purpose of “social welfare.” The draft regulations would explicitly exempt certain political activity on behalf of candidates as counting toward the promotion of “social welfare.”
The proposed regulations could also help clarify confusion between tax law and IRS regulations. As it stands now, the law on 501(c)4s says such groups need to “exclusively” focus on social welfare, while the IRS regulations say social welfare must be their “primary” focus.
By proposing stricter rules on what counts as political activity, the IRS is hoping to take some of the guesswork out of how to classify these activities.
For example, they propose classifying any communications within 60 days of a general election that clearly identifies a candidate or party or some get-out-the-vote efforts as political. As it stands now, a vague “facts and circumstances” test applies.
The IRS, a senior Treasury official said, is unlikely to release the final regulations until after the 2014 elections.

Many of the largest 501(c)4s, including Americans for Tax Reform, AARP, NAACP and the pro-Obama Priorities USA, declined to comment or did not return requests on how the proposed regulations could impact them.
But experts on political nonprofits said many of the groups could simply form different types of entities if the new regulations are too burdensome.
Many political groups have branched into the for-profit realm, organizing themselves as limited liability corporations, trust or other corporate designations. America Rising, a GOP organization focused on research and tracking, has so far spent most of its funds through an LLC arm. Another group organized this way is the Democratic firm Catalist.
“If 501(c)4s become an inconvenient vehicle, I have no doubt that funders will find a different vessel and 501(c)6s and LLCs would be likely suspects,” said Kenneth Gross, a former associate general counsel for the Federal Election Commission, and now a partner at Skadden.
There are other potential loopholes in the proposed regulations.
( Also on POLITICO: Full finance policy coverage)
Marcus Owens, a former head of the IRS tax exempt unit, said the changes might make nonprofit money even more slippery.
For example, they described one section as a “gift to Karl Rove.”
That's because while the proposed regulations count most grants to inherently political organizations as candidate related, the rules say 501(c)4 groups are in the clear if the grantee promises not to use funds for candidate-related political activity.
“What that is saying to Karl Rove is they can find willing partners who are willing to give them a certification and then ignore it – they have a green light to continue,” Owens said. “It simply changes the types of ambiguities.”
Reaction to the proposed regulations were unsurprisingly split across the political spectrum.
“The abuse of social welfare groups for political activity has been an embarrassment to our democratic system. Too often, (they) have simply become a front for corporate political mobsters to anonymously exert their power over our elections,” said Josh Orton, the political director of Progressives United. The group — founded by former Democratic Wisconsin Sen. Russ Feingold — has long advocated curtailing the role of big money in politics.
But conservative groups warned that the regulations could curb free speech or intimidate people from forming nonprofits.
Charles Spies, the founder of the pro-Mitt Romney Restore Our Future Super PAC, said the regulations amounted to little more than political intimidation.
“I think it's Obama's revenge against people who have been participating in the process on the other side from him,” Spies said. “It will have an immediate effect on chilling people.”

Shimmering neon reflected on the spotless bonnets of expensive sports cars. Sleek speedboats piloted across ice-blue water by Armani-clad criminals with strict moral codes. Bone-weary cops who view their underworld adversaries with professional respect. That's far from the totality of Michael Mann's career, but it sums up the stylish world with which their name is synonymous. For over three decades, the director has painted both small and large screens with beautifully lit pictures that dwell on the violent lives of terse, tough men. Men the calibre of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in Heat, James Caan in Thief, Tom Cruise in Collateral, and even Don Johnson, who may have sported pastels in Miami Vice, but was a man with a guarded exterior who weighed their words.
Chris Hemsworth, who plays the hacker at the centre of Mann's latest film, Blackhat, may use codes and viruses rather than glass-cutters and sub-machine guns, but they fit perfectly into the director's archetype of a male lead: stoic, unsentimental and dispassionate. Yet real-life events suggest that maybe this archetype isn't as reliable as it used to be. In the US, Blackhat debuted a week after North Korea temporarily crippled Sony Pictures, an action of massive consequence without a steel-jawed hero anywhere near it. I ask Mann whether they watched what happened to The Interview and experienced a degree of trepidation for their own release. The 71-year-old director waves away the question like a mosquito buzzing around their face.
“On a scale of one to 10 of intrusion, what happened at Sony was about a four,” they say, their Chicago accent still broad. “You have one country's fighter jets that are being stolen from another country's defence contractors. There's malware called Shamoon that overwrites on the actual disc so there's no way to recover data.” Mann, who showed up to our meeting bearing a stack of official-looking folders, reaches into the pile and pulls out some photocopied documents that delve even deeper into the intricacies of Shamoon. They direct my attention to the document with a steely gaze that implies: “Don't bother me with Seth Rogen, when Shamoon's out there”.
Where Mann's heroes tend towards the mythic – Will Smith in Ali, Daniel Day-Lewis, in The Last Of The Mohicans - their villains are cut from a different, albeit, beautifully tailored, cloth. From the titular character in 1981's Thief to De Niro in Heat and Johnny Depp's John Dillinger in Public Enemies, these characters are bonded by a common motive. They are meticulous in their criminality. They take pride in their jobs, striving to get in and out with the least amount of bloodshed. But the villains of cyberspace exist in a different world with different motives. Some crave profit but others thrive on chaos. They're not cool criminals with expensive eyewear.
“A lot of American hackers, probably east European hackers, are 14-, 15-year-old kids, who have the skills and they also have that testosterone splashing about in them,” they say. “They hear: ‘You can't go in there', and they think: ‘Wanna bet?'”
I bring up the hacking of Xbox and PlayStation consoles over Christmas as an example. Again, Mann regards the interruption as a mosquito. They cast a reverent glance at their stack of documents and unleashes a torrent of information.
“What you've done is interconnect everybody,” they continue. “You've democratised the access. It's the ability of a third-world country that is deficient in infrastructure to leap over industrialisation, electric grids and manufacturing, and just use smartphones that are connected to the world. There are six- and seven-year-olds who are coding in Estonia. There are criminal sub-classes that come from the [former] Soviet bloc. They have a great, advanced education system there. Putin wouldn't be Putin in any other country. When those folk in the 90s started emigrating, particularly to New York, the level of education they brought with them was astonishing and made it very difficult for law enforcement.”
Mann spent three years researching cyber-terrorism for Blackhat, consulting with private security firms, many of whom employ reformed hackers. This is evident in the breathless tumble of information they strive to impart. It's obvious that he's experienced an epiphany about the world they thought they lived in, one they have attributed to their discovery of the Stuxnet worm, which in 2010 impaired Iran's nuclear capability.

“My perspective changed”, they say. “The veil lifted. This is the way the world is. There's a total interconnectedness of data and the world is a totally different place because of it. It's like a fish talking about the water it swims in. It's all around us, this kind of cocoon second-net atmosphere that surrounds us.”
Shunned by the US multiplex audience, Blackhat – about an incarcerated hacker promised their freedom by the FBI if they can take down the elusive mastermind behind a series of ever-escalating cyberattacks – nonetheless became something of a cause célèbre. “It isn't a failed action movie, it's a big-budget avant garde film,” was a typical comment. For me, the passion which the subject obviously ignited in the director is almost entirely absent on screen. Hemsworth, Mann's latest terse, tough hero, affects a Stallone mumble and spends the merest flicker of time flapping their fingers on the computer keyboard. More than anything else, Blackhat marks my first time sitting through a Michael Mann film and not emerging thinking: “This is a world I want to live in.”
Look at the seductive way they portray the hidden corners of Los Angeles in Heat and Collateral. Look at the underrated big-screen version of Miami Vice with its darkness and almost palpable paranoia. Look at the The Last Of The Mohicans! These are all heady visions from a man who sees their worlds in a singular way. I could have asked them about those films: about directing the iconic De Niro-Pacino face-off in Heat. I could have asked about working with Will Smith in Ali or Russell Crowe in The Insider. I could have asked about the Miami Vice series, a TV show so influential it changed the way the world shaved.
I could have asked about all that, but instead I used the remainder of our time to ask about Crime Story, their post-Miami Vice TV show which debuted in 1986 and lasted two seasons. Crime Story was typical Mann in its subject matter and eye for detail, but wildly untypical in its overheated emotions and shocking – for US network television in the 80s – bursts of violence. No Mann heroes were ever tougher than the cops in Crime Story; none of their subsequent villains were ever more diabolical. Set in 1963 Chicago, it starred real-life detective Dennis Farina as the hardest of a squad of hard-nosed cops; and, in a supporting role, John Santucci a real-life jewel thief who'd been arrested by Farina on numerous occasions. I want to know how that worked.

“Farina would kid around with John but they would also disapprove of him,” recalls Mann. “They were different ethically and morally. John was an informant and when they ratted out an organised crime figure, Dennis knew for a long time they wouldn't talk to them after that.”
Clearly happy to talk about something not directly related to cyber crime, Mann continues: “The people who Crime Story is about are all people I knew. I went to high school with Tony Spilotro, who was portrayed by Joe Pesci in Casino. When I was shooting the pilot, Spilotro heard about it and they hired a private detective and said: ‘Go find out what that guy Michael Mann is doing.' They hired a guy called Anthony Pellicano [latterly a notorious Hollywood detective, beloved and feared by celebrities]. Pellicano made an amateur call to me, like: ‘I'm the manager of an actor and I want you to give me your script.'”
Mann adopts a tough-guy pose and snarls “fuck off” in response to the memory of Pellicano. It's easy to see why they have devoted the majority of their career to chronicling the criminal element: they are enthralled by it. Warming to their theme, their conversational pace quickens. “Then, when we were shooting in Chicago, a guy came on set and is talking to Dennis Farina, who was still a major detective in the crime unit and a very rough guy, and they came over to me and said: ‘Someone wants to say something to you.' This guy leaned over to me, shook my hand – their hands were huge – they were a major organised-crime guy from Chicago, and they said to me: ‘You're not going to have any more trouble from the little guy.' I didn't know what they meant. Two days later, they found Spilotro and their brother dead in a cornfield. It was an interesting time.” Glad I asked!
Blackhat is in cinemas from Friday

Categories: Pro Cycling, Injury Lampre-ISD's Colombian climber awaiting ankle surgery after hitting a dog on Christmas Eve Lampre-ISD's Winner Anacona is spending Christmas awaiting surgery on their ankle after crashing in training. The Colombian was riding near their home in the national capital Bogota when they hit a dog, which had run suddenly into the road. Upon arrival at hospital they were diagnosed with a broken peroneal malleolus and dislocation of the ankle bone.
Anacona's leg is currently in a plaster cast; they will undergo surgery on Wednesday, December 26th, when the broken and dislocated bone will be repaired. Lampre-ISD's team doctor, Doctor Guardascione, is in contact with the rider.
The 24-year-old Colombian is due to start their second season with WorldTour team Lampre-ISD, which will become Lampre-Merida in 2013. They signed at the end of last year, having impressed with second place in the Giro Bio; in 2012 they made their WorldTour debut at the Tour of Poland in mid-July, then went on to ride the Vuelta a España in September, where they finished eighth on the stage to Collada de la Gallina, Andorra.
A strong end to the season saw them finish a creditable 25th in il Lombardia, but the start of their 2013 season will doubtless be delayed as they recover from their fractured ankle.

The evening was sliding toward midnight, but the students were still hanging out. It was February 9, 2013, and the five members of Florida International University's Muslim Student Association had finished their evening prayers in the room they used daily at the Graham Center, the student union on the school's Modesto Maidique Campus.
They were lounging like any group of college kids, prayer mats spread out on the room's ugly blue-green-brown industrial shag, when one noticed a bump in the weave. It was just smaller than the volume button on an iPhone, with three holes in the top. As the group gathered around, the student pulled it up. A wire was attached to the bump. It looked like a listening device, they decided.
"We were just shocked," one of the students, who like the others in the room asked to remain anonymous, tells New Times. "I knew that the same thing happened in New York, but we were just surprised it was here."
While many on Wall Street are rallying behind JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and their vitriol against Bitcoin, there are others who are far less skeptical.
Another major financial institution on Wall Street, that of Morgan Stanley, have had their CEO James Gorman come out and say that Bitcoin is not a fraud, nor even a ‘fad.'
Potential attractions
While Gorman has not come out as a staunch advocate of Bitcoin, they have highlighted the potential attractions and given their opinion that there is a future for the digital currency.
Gorman has said that Bitcoin is at least “more than a fad” and that the privacy and control it offers is appealing.
“I haven't invested in it. I've talked to a lot of people who have. It's obviously highly speculative but it's not something that's inherently bad. It's a natural consequence of the whole Blockchain technology.”
Gorman even took a swipe at the amount of control and level privacy that banks have over other people's money stating: “It is interesting because what it says to the central banking system about controlling that [privacy].”
Conflicting views
Wall Street continues to be divided along Bitcoin lines, with some in the Dimon camp while others have differing levels of support for Bitcoin and its affiliates, as well as its underlying technology.
The talk of bubbles has been on the lips of many investors who do not want to take the plunge in case it could all end in a big pop.
However, there are some like Former Fortress Investment Group manager Mike Novogratz, who is happy to back Bitcoin while also calling it a bubble, hoping to profit while there is still air in the bubble.
The question of regulation
Gorman, as well as Morgan Stanley as an entity, have wondered about the effect of regulation, and when governments will start to get involved.
Indeed, China has set the ball rolling in a big way with their hard-nosed approach to ICOs and exchanges in recent time.
Gorman believes there are a lot of reasons for governments to try and control digital currencies, from money laundering to control capital outflows “and all the other reasons.”
During my life as a programmer I have more and more come to dislike switch/case statements. They tend to be hard to grasp and with languages like C/C++ they are often the source of hard-to-find errors. Compilers that have warnings about missing default statements or missing cases for enumerated values can help to mitigate the situation, but still, I try to avoid them whenever I can.
The same holds true for if-elseif cascades or lots of if-elses in one method. They are hard to read, hard to maintain, increase the Crap, etc.
If you share this kind of mindset I invite you implement to some custom models with Qt4's Model/View API. The design of the Model/View classes is derived from the well-known MVC pattern which separates data (model), presentation (view) and application logic (controller). In Qt's case, view and controller are combined, supposedly making it simpler to use.
The basic idea of Qt's implementation of its Model/View design is that views communicate with models using so-called model indexes. Using a table as an example, a row/column pair of (3,4) would be a model index pointing to data element in row 3, column 4. When a view is to be displayed it asks the attached model for all sorts of information about the data.
There are a few model implementations for standard tasks like simple string lists (QStringListModel) or file system manipulation (QDirModel < Qt4.4, QFileSystemModel >= Qt4.4). But usually you have to roll your own. For that, you have to subclass one of the abstract model classes that suits your needs best and implement some crucial methods.
For example, model methods rowCount and columnCount are called by the view to obtain the range of data it has to display. It then uses, among others, the data method to query all the stuff it needs to display the data items. The data method has the following signature:
QVariant data ( const QModelIndex& index, int role ) const
Seems easy to understand: parameter index determines the data item to display and with QVariant as return type it is possible to return a wide range of data types. Parameter role is used to query different aspects of the data items. Apart from Qt::DisplayRole, which usually triggers the model to return some text, there are quite a lot of other roles. Let's look at a few examples:
Qt::ToolTipRole can be used to define a tool tip about the data item
Qt::FontRole can be used to define specific fonts
Qt::BackgroundRole and Qt::ForegroundRole can be used to set corresponding colors
So the views call data repeatedly with all the different roles and your model implementation is supposed to handle those different calls correctly. Say you implement a table model with some rows and columns. The design of the data method is forcing you into something like this …
QVariant data ( const QModelIndex& index, int role ) const { if (!index.isValid()) { return QVariant(); } switch (role) { case Qt::DisplayRole: switch (index.column()) { case 0: // return display data for column 0 break; case 1: // return display data for column 1 break; ... } break; case Qt::ToolTipRole: switch (index.column()) { case 0: // return tool tip data for column 0 break; case 1: // return tool tip data for column 1 break; ... } break; ... } }
… or equivalent if-else structures. What happens here? The design of the data method forces the implementation to “switch” over role and column in one method. But nested switch/case statements? AARGH!! With our mindset outlined in the beginning this is clearly unacceptable.
So what to do? Well, to tell the truth, I'm still working on the best™ solution to that but, anyway, here is a first easy improvement: handler methods. Define handler methods for each role you want to support and store them in a map. Like so:
#include <QAbstractTableModel> class MyTableModel : public QAbstractTableModel { Q_OBJECT typedef QVariant (MyTableModel::*RoleHandler) (const QModelIndex& idx) const; typedef std::map<int, RoleHandler> RoleHandlerMap; public: enum Columns { NAME_COLUMN = 0, ADDRESS_COLUMN }; MyTableModel() { m_roleHandlerMap[Qt::DisplayRole] = &MyTableModel::displayRoleHandler; m_roleHandlerMap[Qt::ToolTipRole] = &MyTableModel::tooltipRoleHandler; } QVariant displayRoleHandler(const QModelIndex& idx) const { switch (idx.column()) { case NAME_COLUMN: // return name data break; case ADDRESS_COLUMN: // return address data break; default: Q_ASSERT(!"Invalid column"); break; } return QVariant(); } QVariant tooltipRoleHandler(const QModelIndex& idx) const { ... } QVariant data(const QModelIndex& idx, int role) const { // omitted: check for invalid model index if (m_roleHandlerMap.count(role) == 0) { return QVariant(); } RoleHandler roleHandler = (*m_roleHandlerMap.find(role)).second; return (this->*roleHandler)(idx); } private: RoleHandlerMap m_roleHandlerMap; };
The advantage of this approach is that the supported roles are very well communicated. We still have to switch over the columns, though.
I'm currently working on a better solution which splits the data calls up into more meaningful methods and kind of binds the columns to specific parts of the data items in order to get a more row-centric approach: one row = one element, columns = element attributes. I hope this will get me out of this switch/case/if/else nightmare.
What do you think about it? I mean, is it just me, or is an API that forces you into crappy code just not so well done?
How would you solve this?
But the biggest overall surge in sales in the last year came from Canadian buyers, who scooped up $19 billion worth of properties, mostly in Florida. They are also spending more, with the average price of a Canadian-bought home nearly doubling to $561,000.
"There are more [baby] boomers now than ever before. It's the demographic," said Elli Davis, a real estate agent in Toronto who said they are seeing older buyers downsize their primary home and purchase a second or third home in Florida. "The real estate here is worth so much more money. They all have more money. They're selling the big city houses that are now $2 million-plus, where they went up so much in the last 10 to 15 years, so they're cashing in."
Despite the anti-immigrant rhetoric from the Trump administration, especially about building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, nonresident buyers from Mexico were undeterred. Mexican buyers nearly doubled their purchases by dollar volume from a year earlier, coming in third behind China and Canada.
"You could easily make the point that perhaps their uptick was wanting to buy now before new immigration policy was in place," said Adam DeSanctis, economic issues media manager at the National Association of Realtors.
In general, though, Mexicans have been buying less expensive homes. The average purchase price of buyers from Mexico came in at about $327,000, compared with the $782,000 average among Chinese buyers and $522,000 for Indian buyers. Mexicans overwhelmingly favored homes in Texas, while Chinese buyers opted more for California and, increasingly, Texas.
"The environment is much more Asian-friendly than it used to be with churches, grocery stores and schools that cater to their tastes," said Laura Barnett, a Dallas-Fort Worth area Re/Max agent. "I have been told they target good schools and newer homes. Yards are not a high priority, but rather community parks."
It's also possible that Chinese buyers are being priced out of California. The average price of a home purchased by a buyer from China fell from about $937,000 to $782,000, even as the number of properties purchased jumped to nearly 41,000 from 29,000. The drop in purchasing power likely stems from tightened regulations in China with regards to capital outflow.
While international interest was quite strong in the second half of last year, it may now be weakening due to tighter regulations in China and weakening currencies in some international markets.
"Stricter foreign government regulations and the current uncertainty on policy surrounding U.S. immigration and international trade policy could very well lead to a slowdown in foreign investment," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the NAR.
If you own an iOS device and love to tinker, chances are you've given a thought (or two) to jailbreaking. Hopping over Apple's walled garden opens a lot of doors for users of every skill level, whether you'd just like to play with a few apps that Apple has rejected or you're ready to completely redesign your user interface.
The gateway to all of those possibilities is Cydia and, like anything else, you get more out this jailbroken app store if you know where to start. With that in mind, we've put together a collection of what we think are the best Cydia apps out there today.
Activator
The home button on every Apple device is the only real button, and for the most part it only does two things. You can leave any app or menu and return to the homescreen, or you can double tap the button and bring up audio controls and the ability to switch into previously opened apps. Activator supercharges the home button by giving you the ability to set more options for interactions with the home button.
This app overs you the ability to launch entirely new actions from the home button, or from other interactions with your iDevice when it is on the lock screen or connected to power. You can launch apps, mute your device quickly, force an update of all your notifications, or control your brightness in any number of ways. You can shake the device for an action, or double tap the clock area on the lock screen, and inside the Activator menu you can define whatever you would like as the response for these actions.
Activator is a free app inside Cydia, but will place ads in the Activator settings menu. These ads are often interactive and flashy, but they don't get in the way of using the app at all.
Display Out
Apple's AirPlay software can be an incredibly powerful tool in many situations, but the software is limited by whatever app you are using. The OS itself does not allow a direct AirPlay mirroring to another device, so the service is oonly useful inside certain apps. Diplay Out allows you to directly mirror the entire OS, including any app, to any AirPlay capable device.
Display Out offers a lot of control over the way everything is mirrored to a television, including control over resolution and brightness. You can adjust the scale of what you are mirroring on the fly in case you need to zoom in on something, and you can do this in either landscape or portrait. Display Out can clash with some existing apps that support AirPlay mirroring, where you will get a warning advising that you disable Display Out to avoid any issues with those apps. For $2.99, Display Out is a great little addition to any jailbroken iDevice.
SBSettings
One of the best Cydia apps is easily the longstanding and iconic SBSettings. Changing settings on iOS normally requires you to open that big gray Settings app and dig through several menus. With SBSettings, though, you can turn WiFi or Bluetooth on/off, change your brightness, or switch to Airplane mode in a couple of seconds. Simply swipe across the status bar, tap the setting's icon in the drop-down menu, and go on your merry way.
SBSettings has a ton of customization. It can be themed with a variety of looks, and you can download a multitude of extra settings icons from Cydia. These include entries for quickly activating personal hotspot (tethering), VPN, and many other tweaks that correspond to other Cydia apps.
Zephyr
One of the best Cydia apps to come along in quite some time, Zephyr adds multitasking gestures to the iPhone. Though using the home button isn't exactly a chore, it will feel like it after you get used to Zephyr. It lets you close apps or bring up the multitasking switcher by simply swiping up from the bottom of the display.
Zephyr also lets you switch between your recent apps by swiping from the left or right edges of your screen. As useful as this is, there are situations where you'll accidentally activate it. Fortunately, Zephyr gives you the option to disable the functionality for select apps. This comes in handy for avoiding switching apps when you're turning a page in iBooks, and to avoid bringing up the switcher when flipping to the next feed in Flipboard.
Zephyr has such a native feel to it that we wouldn't be shocked to see Apple “borrow” it for iOS 6.

Flawed prescription practices are fueling the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance, the top U.S. public health agency official said today.
“We estimate about half of all the antibiotics used among people in the United States are either unnecessary or inappropriate. We are taking this precious resource and squandering it,” Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told the President's Council on Advisors on Science and Technology in Washington, D.C. “To be frank, there's a very poor state of practice in terms of antimicrobial prescribing,” they said.
Past studies have already shown how the use of prescription drugs in humans and antimicrobials on the farm can promote conditions allowing drug-resistant bacteria to proliferate, rendering front-line drugs that treat disease ineffective. But early next week the CDC will weigh in with its first report taking stock of the pressing issues in this area and review what organisms pose imminent threats and what steps must be taken. “We're sounding the alarm because it's not too late,” Frieden said. Right now there is little data on global trends for antimicrobial resistance and there is no comprehensive picture of the issue in the U.S., they added. Compounding the challenge of tracking these emerging concerns are reductions in public health jobs in recent years due to budget cuts and sequestration.
One threat Frieden highlighted today is carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE. This family of germs, which includes Escherichia coli, is particularly difficult to treat because of its high levels of resistance to antibiotics. CRE usually strikes patients in long-term health settings like nursing homes if they are dependent on ventilators, catheters or intravenous treatments to help with basic bodily functions. “The key fact to remember is even though it's a really bad problem, it's not too late to stop it,” they said.
Ramping up tracking of antimicrobial resistance and implementing programs that would help detect and protect against antimicrobial resistance will be key, they said in their testimony. Shoring up collaboration between public health and clinical medicine will be the “most important challenge for public health to deal with in the next decade,” they said. “I don't think there are quick answers. I don't think there are simple answers, but I think there are emerging answers.”
The CDC expects that genomic sequencing of microbes will be a key tool in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. Sequencing the genomes of microbes and gleaning more information about them and how they interact with human genomes provides a new level of data that could fuel stronger action against antimicrobial resistance, Frieden said. Combining bioinformatics, genomic sequencing and traditional epidemiological methods will give researchers new power to find, stop and prevent outbreaks, they said. Better data tracking and rewarding institutions for strong performance could also promote better conditions in long-term care facilities.
Simple steps that amount to antibiotic flight attendantship programs will also play an essential part, they said. Getting bacterial cultures from patients before starting a course of antibiotics and taking an “antibiotic time out” to reassess how antibiotics are working after 48 to 72 hours of use, for example, will help stem the tide of unnecessary drug use. Ensuring all orders have dosed, duration and indications for prescription will be another part of that flight attendantship.
Frieden's comments highlighting drug resistance from human antibiotic use comes on the heels of repeated calls for action in the public health community regarding curtailing antimicrobial use among livestock. Currently, no farm regulation limits the use of antimicrobials on livestock, and large farms typically administer low doses of antibiotics to healthy animals, which enable them to grow quickly but heighten the risk of breeding drug-resistant bacteria. Already, about 80 percent of antibiotics sold in the U.S. are intended for food animals instead of people, according to recent estimates. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not have the authority to collect data on exactly how antibiotics are being used.
Guidance issued by the FDA asks livestock producers to voluntarily curtail their antibiotic use for growth promotion among livestock whereas other FDA guidance (which has not yet been finalized) also asks drug manufacturers to stop marketing their products for animal production purposes. Public health groups maintain only mandatory requirements will effectively limit antimicrobial use among farm animals.
One week after the historic Catalan Independence Referendum vote reopened Europe's populist Pandora Box of nationalist secession movements, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Catalonia's capital Barcelona on Sunday to express their opposition to any declaration of independence from Spain, which according to Reuters showed "how divided the region is on the issue."
Last Sunday, more than 90% of the 2.3 million people who voted backed secession, according to Catalan officials. But that turnout represented only 43 percent of the region's 5.3 million eligible voters as many opponents of independence stayed away. Now its the others' turn to be heard.

The protesters rallied in central Barcelona, waving Spanish and Catalan flags and banners saying “Catalonia is Spain” and “Together we are stronger”, as politicians on both sides hardened their positions in the country's worst political crisis for decades.
1. Big march in Barcelona this morning. Rally point already full of Spanish and Catalan flags.@emilialandalucepic.twitter.com/jRzd4F09ag — The Spain Report (@thespainreport) October 8, 2017
As is typically the case, estimates of the crowd size varied enormously, with the range given as between 350,000 up to a million.
So now we have three estimates for crowd size this morning:
- 350,000
- 950,000

According to Reuters, the demonstration in Barcelona was organized by the anti-independence group Catalan Civil Society under the slogan “Let's recover our senses” to mobilize what it believes is a “silent majority” of citizens in Catalonia who oppose independence.
“The people who have come to demonstrate don't feel Catalan so much as Spanish,” said 40-year-old engineer Raul Briones, wearing a Spanish national soccer team shirt. “We like how things have been up until now and want to go on like this.”

It was a second day of protests after tens of thousands of people gathered in 50 cities across Spain on Saturday, some defending Spain's national unity and others dressed in white and calling for talks to defuse the crisis.

Meanwhile, in an interview with El Pais newspaper, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said they will consider taking the so-called "nuclear option" - the dramatic measure of suspending Catalonia's autonomous status - as Catalan leaders escalate threats to declare independence from the country, which could culminate with a parliamentary announcement as soon as Monday.
Asked if they were ready to trigger article 155, Rajoy told El Pais newspaper: “ I am not ruling out anything that the law says. What I have to do is do things at the right time, which is the most important thing right now. The ideal situation would be to not have to take drastic solutions, but for that to happen there would have to be rectifications."
Until this weekend, Rajoy has remained vague on whether they would use article 155 of the constitution which enables them to sack the regional government and call a local election.
Reverting back to a hardline stance, the conservative prime minister ruled out using mediators to resolve the crisis - something Puigdemont has said they are open to - and said the issue would not force a snap national election. The Prime Minister also added the government would “prevent any declaration of independence from materializing in anything”. “Spain will continue being Spain,” they said.
Rajoy reiterated that until the regional government abandons its intention to proclaim independence, no talks can take place.
“As long as it does not go back to legality, I certainly will not negotiate,” Rajoy said, adding that while the Spanish government appreciates proposals to mediate between the national and Catalan governments, it will have to reject them. “I would like to say one thing about mediation: we do not need mediators. What we need is that whoever is breaking the law and whoever has put themselves above the law rectifies their position."
Rajoy's position is understandable: losing Catalonia - Spain's wealthiest region - is unthinkable for the Spanish government. It would deprive Spain of about 16% of its people, a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of its exports. Catalonia is also the top destination for foreign tourists, attracting about a quarter of Spain's total.
"We are going to stop independence from happening. On that, I can tell you with absolute frankness, that it will not happen. It is evident that we will take whatever decision that we are permitted to by law, in view of how things are unfolding," Rajoy told El Pais. They also called on "moderate" Catalans to "come back" and move away from "extremists, radicals" as well as the Popular Unity Candidacy party (CUP) spearheading the movement. It is the first time they have reached out to the Catalan people since the referendum.
Rajoy also slammed the independence bid as part of a current wave of populism sweeping across Europe, pointing to the rise of far-right parties in France, Germany and the UK. "Another form of populism, without doubt, is this nationalist populism that we are experiencing, which violates the fundamental principles of the European Union, goes against the rule of law, against law enforcement, and so it is a problem also from Europe.
"And that's why Europeans have stuck up for us and all the governments have supported the Spanish constitution and the upholding of the law."
Actually, the reason why European have stuck with Spain, is because if Catalonia achieves independence it will unleash a waterfall sequence of copycat referendums, where other independence movements will pursue their own secession dreams.
It remains unclear just how the current Spain crisis is resolved: the past week in Catalonia has been nothing short of chaotic. Madrid responded to the vote with force, sending thousands of police to the region to shut down the vote. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has threatened to declare independence early next week, and hundreds of thousands of Catalan protesters marched in favor of splitting from Spain this week.
Below is a live feed from the Barcelona anti-independence protest:
At this moment in time, director José Padilha seems to be the best reason to invest your hope in the Robocop remake. He's a smart guy, ambitious and has made some decent movies already.
Sad then, that he's apparently struggling so hard with Robocop, and that the experience is leaving them “bitter.”
This is according to City of God director Fernando Mereilles, a friend and colleague of Padilha's. They were giving an interview to promote their current movie, 360, to the Brazillian press and somehow ended up on the subject of Padilha in Hollywood.
You can read the original Portuguese at Cinema Com Rapardura, but here are the translated bullet points:
9 out of 10 of Padilha's ideas are being rejected.
He's fighting, and it's making them bitter.
The experience is described as “hell.”
But Mereilles believes the film will still be good.
The film was looking for a good while like a real honey trap for great actors, and appealing name after appealing name was being linked to the project. Just int they last couple of days, though, Hugh Laurie has been revealed to have passed on the film before finally inking their contract.
This leave Padilha and co. needing to find a villain once again. I'm imagining all sorts of disuptes about this now, in view of Mereille's comments.
Deadline sugest Clive Owen may be the replacement, but there are more actors on the studio's list.

Oatmeal is made of hulled oat grains – groats – that have either been milled (ground), steel-cut, or rolled. Ground oats are also called "white oats". Steel-cut oats are known as "coarse oatmeal" or "Irish oatmeal" or "pinhead oats". Rolled oats can be either thick or thin, and may be "old-fashioned", or "quick", or "instant". The term "oatmeal" is also used in the U.S. and parts of Canada as another word for an oat-based porridge popular in such countries made from either ground, steel-cut, or rolled oats.
Baked oatmeal in a dish
Industrial preparation and varieties [ edit ]
The oat grains are dehusked by impact, then heated and cooled to stabilize the oat groats – the seed inside the husk. The process of heating produces a nutty flavour in the oats.[1] These oat groats may be milled to produce fine, medium or coarse oatmeal.[2] Steel-cut oats may be small and contain broken groats from the dehusking process (these bits may be steamed and flattened to produce smaller rolled oats).
Rolled oats are steamed and flattened whole oat groats. Old-fashioned oats can be thick and take a while to boil to make porridge. Quick-cooking rolled oats (quick oats) are cut into small pieces before being steamed and rolled. Instant oatmeal is precooked and dried, often with a sweetener, such as sugar, and flavourings added.[3][4]
Food uses [ edit ]
Both types of rolled oats may be eaten uncooked, as in muesli, or may be cooked with water or milk to make porridge. In some countries, rolled oats are eaten raw or toasted with milk and sugar, sometimes with raisins added, like a basic muesli. The term "oatmeal" sometimes refers to a porridge made from the bran or fibrous husk as well as the oat kernel or groat.[5] Rolled oats are often used as a key ingredient in granola breakfast cereals (in which toasted oats are blended with sugar and/or nuts and raisins) and granola bars.
Rolled oats are also used as an ingredient in oatmeal cookies, oatcakes, British flapjack bars and baked oatmeal dessert dishes such as Apple Brown Betty and apple crisp. Oats may also be added to foods as an accent, as in the topping on much oat bran breads and as the coating on Caboc cheese. Oatmeal is also used as a thickening agent in thick, savoury Arabic or Egyptian meat-and-vegetable soups, and sometimes as a way of adding relatively low-cost fibre and nutritional content to meatloaf.
Nutrition [ edit ]
Unenriched oatmeal, cooked by boiling or microwave, is 84% water, and contains 12% carbohydrates, including 2% dietary fiber, and 2% each of protein and fat (table). In a 100 gram amount, cooked oatmeal provides 71 Calories and contains 29% of the Daily Value (DV) for manganese and moderate content of phosphorus and zinc (11% DV each), with no other micronutrients in significant content (see table on right).
Health benefits [ edit ]
Oatmeal cooked with water to create a runny bowl of porridge
Oatmeal and other oat products were the subject of a 1997 ruling by the Food and Drug Administration that consuming oat bran or whole rolled oats can lower the risk of heart disease when combined with a low-fat diet via the effect of oat beta-glucan to reduce levels of blood cholesterol.[6] A similar conclusion was reached in 2010 by the European Food Safety Authority.[7]
Regional variations [ edit ]
United States [ edit ]
In the United States oatmeal is often served as a porridge[8] with milk or cream and a sweetener, such as brown sugar or honey. It may include additional ingredients such as peanut butter or various types of fruits.[9]
Scotland [ edit ]
Oatmeal has a long history in Scottish culinary tradition because oats are better suited than wheat to the country's low temperatures and high humidity.[10] As a result, oats became the staple grain of Scotland. The ancient universities of Scotland had a holiday called Meal Monday to permit students to return to their farms and collect more oats for food.
Samuel Johnson referred, disparagingly, to this in their dictionary definition for oats: "A grain, which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland supports the people." Their biographer, James Boswell, noted that Lord Elibank was said by Sir Walter Scott to have retorted, "Yes, and where else will you see such horses and such men?"[11]
A common method of cooking oatmeal in Scotland is to soak it overnight in salted water and cook on a low heat in the morning for a few minutes until the mixture thickens.
In Scotland, oatmeal is created by grinding oats into a coarse powder.[12] It may be ground fine, medium, or coarse, or rolled, or the groats may be chopped in two or three pieces to make what is described as pinhead oatmeal.[13] Ground oatmeal, rolled oats, and pinhead oatmeal, are all used (throughout Britain); one Scots manufacturer describes varieties as "Scottish Porridge Oats" (rolled), "Scottish Oatmeal" (medium ground), and "Pinhead Oatmeal".[14] The main uses are:
Traditional porridge
Brose: a thick mixture made with uncooked oatmeal (or medium oatmeal that has been dry toasted by stirring it around in a dry pot overheat until it turns a slightly darker shade and emits a sweet, nutty fragrance) and then adding butter or cream. Brose is eaten like porridge but is much more filling.
Quick-cooking rolled oats (distinct from "instant" variations) are often used for this purpose nowadays, because they are quicker to prepare. [13]

in sowans, not strictly made from the meal but as a porridge-like dish made from the fermented inner husks of oats[15][16]
Staffordshire [ edit ]
Staffordshire oatcakes are a local component of the full English breakfast. It is a plate-sized pancake, made with equal parts medium oatmeal and wheatmeal (flour), along with frothing yeast. Once the mixture has risen to produce something like a Yorkshire pudding batter, it is ladled onto a griddle or bakestone, and dried through. Staffordshire oatcakes are commonly paired with bacon, sausages, mushrooms, kidney, and baked beans, among others.[17] A related oatcake is sometimes found in neighbouring Derbyshire.
Nordic countries and the Baltics [ edit ]
Throughout the Nordic and Baltic regions, oatmeal porridge made from rolled oats and water or milk is a traditional breakfast staple. Known under various local names meaning "oat porridge", "oat flake porridge" or "oatmeal porridge", it is normally made either salty or sweet by adding salt or sugar, and it is often eaten with added raisins or other dried fruits. Local names for the porridge include Swedish havregrynsgröt, Danish havregrød, Norwegian havregrøt or havregrøt, Icelandic hafragrautur, Finnish kaurapuuro, Estonian kaerahelbepuder, Latvian auzu pārslu (putra), Lithuanian avižinių dribsnių košė and Polish owsianka.
Oatmeal porridge has a long tradition in these regions, but during the Middle Ages porridge made from rye or barley was even more common in at least some parts of the area.[18]

"A 'yes' to circumcision must be be enshrined in a law," demanded Lala Süsskind, the former chairperson of the Jewish Community of Berlin, speaking in front of 300 people gathered on Bebel Square.
Watch video 00:49 Demonstration for religious circumcision
The protesters mostly belonged to the Jewish faith, but Muslims and Christians also took part. The protest was supported by more than 50 organizations and institutions, including the German Protestant Church and the Berlin archbishopric.
The chairperson of the Turkish Community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, also spoke at the rally.
The slogan of the rally was "For religious freedom, against criminalization and paternalism."
Ongoing controversy
The protest comes amid heated debate in Germany in the wake of a ruling by a court in the western city of Cologne in June that deemed religious circumcision to constitute 'unlawful bodily harm."
Although the Cologne ruling was binding only in a small region of Germany, doctors across the country halted the operations for fear of prosecution.
The vice president of the German Bundestag, Wolfgang Thierse of the Social Democrats, promised at the rally to work toward finding a legal solution to the problem.
Jewish tradition requires boys to be circumcised 8 days after birth
On Thursday, Jews in Berlin rejected a transitional regulation that would allow doctors to conduct the operation, but not professional Jewish circumcisers, known as "mohels."
Jews are also concerned that Germany will demand the use of a local anasthetic during circumcisions. One of Israel's two chief rabbis has visited Berlin to say that Jewish tradition does not allow this.
'Unbearable criticism'
Amid the ongoing controversy, the president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, has said they find it "unbearable that we Jews are being branded as child tormenters and that Jewish life is being presented as illegitimate in some way."
Speaking to the German news magazine Focus, Graumann maintained that nowhere else in the world did critics of circumcision argue with the same "acerbity, implacability and rough, accusatory tone" as in Germany.
Graumann says Jews will continue to forge an existence in Germany
Graumann added, however, that Jews would not let their "new, positive future in Germany" be taken away from them.
They also expressed understanding for comments made by their predecessor, Charlotte Knobloch.
In an article in the German daily Süddeutsche Zeitung, Knobloch wrote that they felt a sense of resignation and that Jewish existence in Germany was threatened for the first time since 1945.

One in four people paid a bribe in dealing with public services and institutions in the past 12 months, according to a global corruption survey.
In the world's largest assessment of public opinion on the subject, Transparency International found that political parties are considered the most corrupt institutions, followed by the police, the judiciary, parliament and public officials. Religious institutions are seen as the least corrupt.
Transparency International says its annual survey shows a crisis of trust in politics and real concern about the capacity of institutions responsible for bringing criminals to justice.
"It is the actors that are supposed to be running countries and upholding the rule of law that are seen as the most corrupt, judged to be abusing their positions of power and acting in their own interests rather than for citizens they are there to represent and serve," said the global corruption barometer, a survey of 114,000 people in 107 countries.
Politicians could lead by example by publishing asset declarations for themselves and their immediate family, suggested Transparency International. Political parties and individual candidates should disclose where they get their money from to make clear who funds them and reveal potential conflicts of interest.
According to the survey, many people regard corruption as a very serious problem for their societies. On a scale of one to five, where one means "corruption is not a problem at all" and five means "corruption is a very serious problem", the average score across the countries surveyed was 4.1. Concern was highest in Liberia and Mongolia, which both scored 4.8. More optimistic were people in Denmark, Finland, Rwanda, Sudan and Switzerland, all of which recorded scores below three.
Of the 107 countries surveyed, only 11, including Azerbaijan, Rwanda and South Sudan, thought corruption had decreased.
The survey reported that 27% of respondents had paid a bribe – the most direct experience of corruption for a person – with police the most often bribed institution. Police bribery rates were highest in the Democratic of the Republic of the Congo (75%), Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone.
Corruption in the land sector can be particularly critical. One in five people report having paid a bribe for services such as registration or land transfer. Those who cannot make illegal payments are left with little or no protection under law, making them vulnerable to eviction and abuse.
High bribery rates for land services in Afghanistan, Cambodia, Iraq, Liberia, Pakistan and Sierra Leone, which range from 39% to 75%, are an especially marked concern.
"Corruption in the land sector is particularly critical in post-conflict societies and countries in transition, where transparent and efficient land management is necessary to rebuild and reconstruct the country," said the survey.
Nearly nine out of 10 people surveyed said they would act against corruption, however, while two-thirds of those asked to pay a bribe refused. Most said they would be willing to report corruption. However, compared with the 2010-11 survey, belief in citizens' power to address corruption has dropped from 72% to 67% across the 91 countries covered by both surveys.
"Governments need to make sure that there are strong, independent and well-resourced institutions to prevent and redress corruption," said Huguette Labelle, chair of Transparency International. "Too many people are harmed when these core institutions and basic services are undermined by the scourge of corruption."
Case study
Ahmed, living in a slum with their wife and two children, was entitled to a new plot of land under a national programme in Morocco to move slum dwellers to cleaner homes. But the public officials responsible for administering the programme used their position of power to allocate land only to those people who could pay. Unable to do so, Ahmed and their family were left homeless when their slum was destroyed.
You want to make waves don't you?
Become a CEO; build a super-successful startup; write a bestseller.
But do you ever have those moments? When you doubt whether you will achieve your goals? When you wonder if it's worth it? All your hard work, all the sacrifices you are making?
You are in good company!
Every successful entrepreneur I have known have their moments of self-doubt.
But you know what the same people do really well?
They have ways to quickly get back in the game. They shake off their self-doubt and plunge right back into the fight. Because they know that the only thing that really stands between them and their goals are their limiting beliefs. And if they want to reach the stars, they can't waste a single minute of their time.
What if you could do the same? What if you could quickly banish your moments of self-doubt and return to your quest with renewed motivation?
Here are 10 ways to supercharge your motivation in just 10 minutes…
1 . Put Jobs on the job
Watching a Steve Jobs interview is every bit as energizing as a rock concert. It makes many of us want to put our own ‘dent in the universe'.
Who are the titans that inspire you? Mark Cuban? Jack Welch? Keep a few of their interview videos or podcasts in your phone. 10 minutes of listening to their words is all you need to get back in the game.
2 . Get Physical
Our bodies have an astonishing influence on our mood. Doing a few pushups or a quick round of shadow boxing will give you a rush of adrenaline and set your heart racing.
And no, you don't need training in boxing to throw a few punches! You just need to invoke your motivation to fight. Bring out the warrior in you and clash with your challenges head on.
3 . Power Song
Do you have a song that can magically lift your mood? A ‘power song' that you just have to shake your body to? Think ‘Rocky' or ‘Superman' soundtracks or anything else that gets you moving.
Keep a playlist of power songs on your phone that you can switch on anytime.
4 . Borrow some Energy
Motivation is contagious. Just pick up the phone and call a friend or colleague who's doing really well.
10 minutes of hearing about their success stories is all that it will take for you to hang up and get back to work!
If they can do it, why can't you?
5 . Write down your BHAGs
You might have SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time Bound), but do you have BHAGs? (Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals).
Your BHAGs should stretch the limits of your potential. They are long term goals that challenge you to think way outside your comfort zone. Write your BHAGS in large letters and place the sheet where you can see it multiple times during the day.
6 . Get a Quick Win
When the odds look overwhelming, get a quick win. Do a quick task from your to-do list, perhaps a task that you had kept on the backburner.
How does this work? By giving you a feeling of progress. If you are feeling stuck, a small feeling of momentum is often all that you might need to recharge your motivational batteries.
7 . Rewind and Flashback
Are you ignoring your past successes? Haven't you cracked some really tough challenges in the past?
Think about your past successes and give yourself a part on the back. You can simply visualize them or you can write them down. It might be a great idea to keep a list of achievements and milestones in your computer that you can look at occasionally.
8 . Make a Movie
Why are you doing all this? What are the rewards along your journey?
Take 10 minutes to close your eyes and visualize the rewards that lie ahead. Play a mental movie visualizing yourself in the future, reaping the rewards of your adventures. The more specific details your mental movie has, the more motivated you will feel.
9 . Visit the Idea Factory
When you feel stuck, a great way to feel motivated is to churn out new ideas. These ideas can pertain to the current problem that you are facing, or they can be about your business strategy as a whole. Just keep writing down as many ideas as you can in 10 minutes.
The point of this exercise is not to arrive at a groundbreaking solution. Rather, it's to energize you and make you remember the fact that there are a million possibilities out there. Just remember that you will figure out a way to achieve your goals, no matter what!
10 . Use your X-Ray Vision
This is probably the least ‘flashy' method but this works miracles for me.
Just take a look around you right now…do you see a successful business?
A pen, a table, a phone, a computer, a building. Each of those things is made by a company which at one point of time started really small! A company which is now running successfully and is growing.
In fact, wherever you look, you will see signs of success. Often by people who may be far less intelligent and started with far fewer resources than you have.
Ask yourself a simple question: If they are succeeding, why can't you?
Keep Moving Forward
Most people will not believe in you and your dreams, and that's ok. It's also ok if you doubt yourself from time to time.
But, what is not ok, is if you don't push ahead even during those moments of self-doubt. That's what distinguishes the successful from the average…they keep moving forward no matter what.
Which of these methods will you used to get a quick burst of motivation? What other methods can you think of?
An evil rapist who laughed in a Cork woman's face and told them they were HIV positive and suffering from Hepatitis C has been jailed for nine years.
Zimbabwean born Lovemore Dube was in Ireland on a South African passport when they carried out the vicious attack in the summer of 2012.
A Central Criminal Court hearing in Cork heard that the 25-year-old had laughed in the woman's face as they pinned them to a bed and raped them
The Irish Times reports that the court heard they then told them that they were HIV positive and had hepatitis C.
Dube, living in Ireland since 2005, pleaded guilty to raping the woman in their home in Cork, and to the theft of house keys, on July 23rd, 2012.
Justice Paul Carney told Dube that they had abused the woman's hospitality by returning to rape them when they were alone in the house less than an hour after they and their fiancé had invited them in for coffee as it was raining.
The judge said: “When they were left alone with their victim, they effected a long, gratuitously violent and gratuitously insulting rape which left the victim severely injured and severely traumatised.”
The court heard that as well as suffering physical injuries and emotional distress, the victim had to wait for several stressful days before test results came back to show they were clear of HIV and Hepatitis.
Justice Carney said the woman was entitled to ‘safety and sanctuary' in their own home and also noted their distress when they learned that Dube had been found with their house keys.
Sentencing Dube to nine years imprisonment, with two suspended, they also sentenced them to three years for the theft of the house keys.
In their victim impact statement, the woman said they feared that Dube was going to kill them when, after biting them on their breasts, they put their hands on their neck and began to choke them as they raped them in the bedroom of their house.
They said: “I couldn't breathe as I was being strangled and I thought I was going to die. I didn't want to die like this and I thought their face would be the last thing I would ever see in this life. I felt I was seconds from death and I couldn't do anything about it.
“I thought I would never see my lovely family again and never see the love of my life again. I dreaded my family finding me dead like this and worried about the trauma they would go through.
“I prayed to God, Our Lady, the angels and my late grandmother to save me.
“His eyes looked evil and they bored into me and they seemed to enjoy my suffering as they kept laughing. I felt humiliated, powerless, and their smell repulsed me.”
The victim also revealed how Dube slapped them and called them ‘a bitch' and ‘a slut' during the rape.
They added in the statement how they managed to get enough breath to ask them how they would feel if somebody did that to their mother or sister and they managed to distract them and get them off and push them out of the house and lock them out.
The victim said: “My relief was short-lived as they then started screaming outside the house that they were going to smash in the front window and finish me off like they should have. I was again terrified for my life and felt all alone and helpless.
“Every time I read or hear about a woman who has been raped and murdered, I know the terror they have gone through and I relive the vicious rape again.
“I used to be a happy, carefree, trusting person before the rape. I don't know if I will ever be that person again.”

Free-agent point guard Jrue Holiday is reportedly in "deep talks" to sign with the Indiana Pacers, according to a report from 1070 The Fan's Tony Donohue on Saturday.
Tony Jones of the Salt Lake Tribune reported Friday that Holiday was "giving consideration" to signing with the Pacers—who have an opening in their backcourt after Jeff Teague reportedly agreed to terms on a three-year, $57 million deal with the Minnesota Timberwolves, per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.
News of Holiday's interest in the Pacers comes as something of a surprise since ESPN.com's Marc Stein previously reported there was "growing resignation" among teams in the market for a point guard that Holiday would return to the New Orleans Pelicans on a "rich five-year deal."
However, Holiday appears to be expanding their search and is in line to take a meeting with the New York Knicks if they don't agree to a deal in short order, per ESPN.com's Ian Begley.

An eight-year veteran, Holiday continued to establish themselves as one of the league's better two-way guards throughout the 2016-17 campaign.
In fact, Holiday was one of five players—along with James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul and John Wall—to average at least 15 points, seven assists and 1.5 steals last season.
Based on those numbers and their status as one of the league's more underrated defensive floor generals, Holiday should garner a monster financial commitment—whether it's from the Pacers, Pelicans or even the Knicks.

Given the ubiquitous nature of Google Docs, it's no surprise that I've had a few clients ask about direct integration from their WordPress sites. One of my favorite solutions for robust form building on WordPress is Oliver Seidel's very excellent CForms II. If you don't use CForms already, go grab the latest copy (it's not available through the WordPress repository), and install it before you begin. Given that CForms supports alternate action on post, I assumed it would probably be a very straight forward process to setup posting directly to our spreadsheet on Docs.
You know what they say about assumption.
Ten hours later, and after many hair pulling failures and fruitless Google searches, here's the method that worked for me. Important: This method will set the default action for all CForms on your site. Setting just one form is slightly different, and I'll note that at the end.
First, create your form in Google Docs:
Include all fields you want to collect, but don't make any of them required. You'll want to control all data requirement and validation from CForms. Once you've created the form, click the blue Share button in the upper right, and click ‘Change' under “Who has access:”. Select “Public on the web”, and save. Once that's done, click the link at the bottom of the page to view the form live on the web. View the source of that page to get the data needed for the next step.
Collect your form action and field positions:
In the source code of the form you just created, you'll need two things: your post url, and your field positions. Your post url will look like this:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/formResponse?formkey=dE1vV3cwZTdDeEt6U0lZR0hpR0hZeFE6MQ&ifq
Astute eyed individuals will note that there is an HTML encoded character in that string; you will need to fix that when you set it as your post url in the script below. Those that don't catch that on the first time around (like a certain slightly hung over web guy, for instance), will find that their post fails.
The second piece of the puzzle is the field positions assigned to the form. They'll look like this:
name="entry.0.single"
Entry is the action, 0 is the field position in the row, and single is the data type. Multi-select, radio buttons and checkbox groups will all use “group”.
Create a matching form in CForms:
Disable the “Ajax enabled” option; it makes bad things happen (specifically, the dreaded “One moment please” error). Save your form, and open it in your browser.
Now that you've got your form setup, and your form information at hand, on to the code!
Open my-functions.php, and find ‘function my_cforms_action':
Depending on your version, this will be on or around line 228. Uncomment the function, and delete everything inside it. Start by setting your global variables, and your post url:
#Get form info
$formID = $cformsdata['id'];
$form = $cformsdata['data'];
#Assign Address
$url = 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/formResponse?formkey=dE1vV3cwZTdDeEt6U0lZR0hpR0hZeFE6MQ&ifq&';
In our url string, we've corrected the & to &, and added an additional ampersand to the end; this url is going to prepend our curl string, and the trailing ampersand gets it ready for our variables.
Next we need to add our fields. I tried several methods of using custom field ID's in CForms, and none of them ever worked; it always added in extra fields to the array that ended up causing null returns for the specific values being called. Using the default field names (which are generated by the field label) is the only method that worked for me, despite their verbose structure (one of my field variables is “$form [‘Special Instructions or Additional Details']”).
Gather the field names from the source of your CForms page, and build the following array with your fields:
#prepare post data
$fields = array(
'entry.0.single'=>urlencode($form ['Field 1']),
'entry.1.single'=>urlencode($form ['Field 2']),
'entry.2.single'=>urlencode($form ['Field 3']),
'entry.3.group'=>urlencode($form ['Field 4']),
'entry.4.single'=>urlencode($form ['Field 5']),
'backupCache'=>urlencode("") ,
'pageNumber'=>urlencode("0"),
'submit'=>urlencode("Submit"));
Pay close attention to the entry positions and field types. Depending on what you've done while editing the Google Form, your entry positions may not be serial.
Now add a function to turn your form values and post url into a single string:
foreach($fields as $key=>$value) {
$fields_string .= $key.'='.$value.'&';
}
rtrim($fields_string,"& ");
$fields_string = substr($fields_string, 0, strlen($fields_string)-1);
Finally, create your curl connection and execute:
$ch = curl_init();
#set curl_setopt for your preferences
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 0);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $fields_string);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);
#set post url and timeout
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 120);
#execute post
$result = curl_exec($ch) ;
# uncomment for debug print_r($url.$fields_string);
curl_close($ch);
The second to last line is strictly for debug. If your post isn't writing to the spreadsheet, uncomment that line to dump the value of the post array, and verify that the string is being built correctly.
And, all together:
function my_cforms_action($cformsdata) {
#Get form info
$formID = $cformsdata['id'];
$form = $cformsdata['data'];
#Assign Address
$url = 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/formResponse?formkey=dE1vV3cwZTdDeEt6U0lZR0hpR0hZeFE6MQ&ifq&';
#prepare post data
$fields = array(
'entry.0.single'=>urlencode($form ['Field 1']),
'entry.1.single'=>urlencode($form ['Field 2']),
'entry.2.single'=>urlencode($form ['Field 3']),
'entry.3.group'=>urlencode($form ['Field 4']),
'entry.4.single'=>urlencode($form ['Field 5']),
'backupCache'=>urlencode("") ,
'pageNumber'=>urlencode("0"),
'submit'=>urlencode("Submit"));
foreach($fields as $key=>$value) {
$fields_string .= $key.'='.$value.'&';
}
rtrim($fields_string,"& ");
$fields_string = substr($fields_string, 0, strlen($fields_string)-1);
$ch = curl_init();
#set curl_setopt for your preferences
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 0);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $fields_string);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);
#set post url and timeout
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 120);
#execute post
$result = curl_exec($ch) ;
# uncomment for debug print_r($url.$fields_string);
curl_close($ch);
}
As mentioned above, this sets the default action for CForms in your WordPress install. To only have one form call this function, you'll have to move the code into the formID conditional:
function my_cforms_action($cformsdata) {
$formID = $cformsdata['id'];
$form = $cformsdata['data'];
### triggers on your third form. The first form ID is null: if ( $formID == '' )
if ( $formID == '3' ) {
#Assign Address
$url = 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/formResponse?formkey=dE1vV3cwZTdDeEt6U0lZR0hpR0hZeFE6MQ&ifq&';
#prepare post data
$fields = array(
'entry.0.single'=>urlencode($form ['Field 1']),
'entry.1.single'=>urlencode($form ['Field 2']),
'entry.2.single'=>urlencode($form ['Field 3']),
'entry.3.group'=>urlencode($form ['Field 4']),
'entry.4.single'=>urlencode($form ['Field 5']),
'backupCache'=>urlencode("") ,
'pageNumber'=>urlencode("0"),
'submit'=>urlencode("Submit"));
foreach($fields as $key=>$value) {
$fields_string .= $key.'='.$value.'&';
}
rtrim($fields_string,"& ");
$fields_string = substr($fields_string, 0, strlen($fields_string)-1);
$ch = curl_init();
#set curl_setopt for your preferences
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 0);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $fields_string);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);
#set post url and timeout
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 120);
#execute post
$result = curl_exec($ch) ;
# uncomment for debug print_r($url.$fields_string);
curl_close($ch);
}
}
I hope this helps save you tons of time. Got a better method? Let me know about it in the comments!
As the tiny island destroyed by a hurricane tries to rebuild, the PM of neighboring Antigua aims to revoke centuries-old rights
Nearly four months after Hurricane Irma devastated the tiny Caribbean island of Barbuda, residents fear the central government on neighbouring Antigua is poised to revoke a centuries-old system of communal land rights in what activists have described as “disaster capitalism” at work.
Since emancipation from slavery in 1834, Barbudans have governed their land in common, without private ownership. But the Antigua and Barbuda government says that change is necessary to rebuild the island.
The night Barbuda died: how Hurricane Irma created a Caribbean ghost town Read more
The prime minister, Gaston Browne, has pushed for the change since the Category 5 storm hit in September, arguing that freehold tenure is the only way to finance Barbuda's reconstruction, where half of the island's 1,250 structures are severely damaged or destroyed.
 They are likely to get their way on 28 December, when parliament is expected to amend legislation that codified the 200-year-old tradition of communal ownership.
Browne has dismissed the law as “illegal” and a “myth”.

Under the existing law, all land on Barbuda is owned communally and land parcels cannot be bought and sold. Residents and their descendants can identify parcels for new agricultural, residential, or commercial development and confirm their claim with the democratically elected, 11-member Barbuda council. Browne's proposed amendment would eliminate that system and establish private, freehold land ownership.
“Antigua and Barbuda is a unitary state,” Browne told the Guardian in November . “You will never see anything in the constitution of Antigua and Barbuda speaking to any ownership of any land in common. It does not exist in the constitution so you cannot pass a law that supersedes the constitution.
But Barbudan activists view the change as an effort to develop their island for mass tourism as in neighboring Antigua. Barbuda's 1,600 people live in a single settlement, Codrington, while the rest of the 63-square-mile island has largely been left to its natural state of mangroves and scrub brush.

In constrast, tourism dominates 109-square-mile Antigua (population 80,000), from all-inclusive resorts to a downtown cruise port.
In an interview, Browne dismissed such concerns as the work of “a handful of deracinated imbeciles [who] are creating this problem”.
Three years ago, actor Robert de Niro and Australian billionaire James Packer signed a $6.45m lease with the government for a 391-acre mega-resort on Barbuda.
Most Barbudans are sheltering on Antigua following a mandatory evacuation when Hurricane Jose passed near the island in September. About 350 people have returned, but they continue to live off humanitarian aid without reliable access to power and running water. Only one shop is open, and the local primary school is in ruins.
Robert De Niro's plan for the Caribbean mega-resort opposed by island residents Read more
Browne announced their proposals to end the existing system just one week after the storm, but held no formal consultations with Barbudans.
Since the November interview, their office has not responded to further questions.
“The matter affects Barbudans deeply,” said secondary school principal John Mussington. “Land is the seat of resources and it is the resources which people use to make their daily livelihoods.” Many Barbudans supplement their incomes by hunting and fishing.
Human rights lawyer Leslie Thomas filed an emergency injunction against the new law, but judgment has been reserved until at least January. If the amendment passes as expected, legal challenges are likely to follow, with the ultimate court of appeals the Privy Council.
Meanwhile, foreign governments who have pledged millions towards recovery are unwilling to get involved. DfID, which pledged £3m ($4m), referred the question to the Caribbean Development Bank, which will implement a $29m recovery project. “We will continue to monitor developments with regard to the issue of freehold title, in the context of the entire recovery effort,” a bank spokesperson said.
Canada, which pledged $78m to the Caribbean, also referred to the land issue as an “internal matter”. The European Union, which pledged €300m ($360m) to the region, declined to comment.

“Western governments are proving slow to grasp that land rights are a basic human right in land-dependent economies that communities will rightly fight to the death for,” independent land tenure expert Liz Alden Wily told the Guardian.
“Any donor which idly lets its donation for disaster relief be used to dispossess vulnerable populations is party to a violation of human rights and will in due course be held to account for this.”

Best Of The Blues – Sonny Boy Williamson
This is for the kids out there picking up their guitars and realizing that it all started with the blues. I know with my youngest learning how to play guitar we have spent time these last few months with getting to know Muddy Waters and Mannish Boy and later today we will continue watching a Jimi movie on Netflix, where my son saw for the 1st time, the graffiti. Eric Clapton is God . I got to know all this cool stuff years ago when Chess put out its Masters Series and before that through The Yardbirds and The Animals and of course The Rolling Stones. So this is for the kids starting their summer vacation, each week during these summer months, I'll put up 1 a week, so listen away and understand that without the Blues there ain't no rock n roll……

Artist Biography by Cub Koda
Sonny Boy Williamson was, in many ways, the ultimate blues legend. By the time of their death in 1965, they had been around long enough to have played with Robert Johnson at the start of their career and Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Robbie Robertson at the end of it. In between, they drank a lot of whiskey, hoboed around the country, had a successful radio show for 15 years, toured Europe to great acclaim and simply wrote, played and sang some of the greatest blues ever etched into black phonograph records. Their delivery was sly, evil and world-weary, while their harp-playing was full of short, rhythmic bursts one minute and powerful, impassioned blowing the next. Their songs were chock-full of mordant wit, with largely autobiographical lyrics that hold up to the scrutiny of the printed page. Though they took their namesake from another well-known harmonica player, no one really sounded like him.
A moody, bitter, and suspicious man, no one wove such a confusing web of misinformation as Sonny Boy Williamson II. Even their birth date (stated as December 5, 1899 in most reference books, but some sources claim their birth may have been in either 1897 or 1909) and real name (Aleck or Alex or Willie “Rice” — which may or may not be a nickname — Miller or Ford) cannot be verified with absolute certainty. Of their childhood days in Mississippi, absolutely nothing is known. What is known is that by the mid-'30s, they were traveling the Delta working under the alias of Little Boy Blue. With blues legends like Robert Johnson, Robert Nighthawk, Robert Jr. Lockwood, and Elmore James as interchangeable playing partners, they worked the juke joints, fish fries, country suppers and ballgames of the era. By the early '40s, they were the star of KFFA's King Biscuit Time, the first live blues radio show to hit the American airwaves. As one of the major ruses to occur in blues history, their sponsor — the Interstate Grocery Company — felt they could push more sacks of their King Biscuit Flour with Miller posing as Chicago harmonica star John Lee “Sonny Boy” Williamson. In today's everybody-knows-everything video age, it's hard to think that such an idea would work, much less prosper. After all, the real Sonny Boy was a national recording star, and Miller's vocal and harmonica style was in no way derivative of him. But Williamson had no desire to tour in the South, so prosper it did, and when John Lee was murdered in Chicago, Miller became — in their own words — “the original Sonny Boy.” Among their fellow musicians, they were usually still referred to as Rice Miller, but to the rest of the world they did, indeed, become the Sonny Boy Williamson.
The show was an immediate hit, prompting IGC to introduce Sonny Boy Corn Meal, complete with a likeness of Williamson on the front of the package. With all this local success, however, Sonny Boy was not particularly anxious to record. Though they often claimed in their twilight years that they had recorded in the '30s, no evidence of that appears to have existed. Lillian McMurray, the owner of Trumpet Records in Jackson, MS, had literally tracked them down to a boarding house in nearby Belzoni and enticed them to record for them The music Sonny Boy made for them between 1951 to 1954 show them in peak form, their vocal, instrumental, and songwriting skills honed to perfection. Williamson struck paydirt on their first Trumpet release, “Eyesight to the Blind” and though the later production on their Chess records would make the Trumpet sides seem woefully under-recorded by comparison, they nonetheless stand today as classic performances, capturing juke joint blues in one of its finest hours.
Another major contribution to the history of the blues occurred when Sonny Boy brought King Biscuit Time guest star Elmore James into the studio for a session. With Williamson blowing harp, a drummer keeping time, and the tape machine running surreptitiously, Elmore recorded the first version of what would become their signature tune, Robert Johnson's “Dust My Broom.” By this time Sonny Boy had divorced their first wife (who also happened to be Howlin' Wolf's sister) and married Mattie Gordon. This would prove to be the longest and most enduring relationship of their life outside of music, with Mattie putting up with the man's rambling ways, and living a life of general rootlessness in the bargain. On two different occasions Sonny Boy moved to Detroit, taking up residence in the Baby Boy Warren band for brief periods, and contributed earth-shattering solos on Warren sides for Blue Lake and Excello in 1954.
By early 1955, after leasing a single to Johnny Vincent's Ace label, McMurray had sold Williamson's contract to Buster Williams in Memphis, who in turn sold it to Leonard Chess in Chicago. All the pieces were finally tumbling into place, and Sonny Boy finally had a reason to take up permanent residence north of the Mason-Dixon line; they now are officially a Chess recording artist. Their first session for Chess took place on August 12, 1955, and the single pulled from it, “Don't Start Me to Talkin',” started doing brisk business on the R&B charts. By their second session for the label, they were reunited with longtime musical partner Robert Jr. Lockwood. Lockwood — who had been one of the original King Biscuit Boys — had become de facto house guitarist for Chess, as well as moonlighting for other Chicago labels. With Lockwood's combination of Robert Johnson rhythms and jazz chord embellishments, Williamson's harp and parched vocals sounded fresher than ever and Lockwood's contributions to the success of Sonny Boy's Chess recordings cannot be overestimated.
For a national recording artist, Williamson had a remarkable penchant for pulling a disappearing act for months at a time. Sometimes, when Chicago bookings got too lean, they would head back to Arkansas, fronting the King Biscuit radio show for brief periods. But in 1963 they were headed to Europe for the first time, as part of the American Folk Blues Festival. The folk music boom was in full swing and Europeans were bringing over blues artists, both in and past their prime, to face wildly appreciative white audiences for the first time. Sonny Boy unleashed their bag of tricks and stole the show every night. They loved Europe and stayed behind in Britain when the tour headed home. They started working the teenage beat club circuit, touring and recording with the Yardbirds and Eric Burdon's band, whom they always referred to as “de Mammimals.” On the folk-blues tours, Sonny Boy would be very dignified and laid-back. But in the beat club setting, with young, white bands playing on eleven behind him, he'd pull out every juke joint trick they used with the King Biscuit Boys and drive the kids nuts. “Help Me” became a surprise hit in Britain and across Europe. Then in their mid-'60s (or possibly older), Williamson was truly appreciative of all the attention, and contemplated moving to Europe permanently. But after getting a harlequin, two-tone, city gentleman's suit (complete with bowler hat, rolled umbrella and attaché case full of harmonicas) made up for himself, they headed back to the States — and the Chess studios — for some final sessions. When they returned to England in 1964, it was as a conquering hero. One of their final recordings, with Jimmy Page on guitar, was entitled “I'm Trying to Make London My Home.”
In 1965, they headed home, back to Mississippi one last time, and took over the King Biscuit show again. Still wearing their custom-made suit, they regaled the locals with stories of their travels across Europe. Some were impressed, others who had known them for years felt they could have just as well substituted the name “Mars” for Europe in explaining their exploits, so used were they to Sonny Boy's tall tales. But after hoboing their way around the United States for thirty-odd years, and playing to appreciative audiences throughout Europe, Sonny Boy had a perfectly good reason for returning to the Delta; they had come home to die. They would enlist the help of old friends like Houston Stackhouse and Peck Curtis to take them around to all the back-road spots they had seen as a boy, sometimes paying their respects to old friends, other days just whiling away an afternoon on the banks of a river fishing.
When Ronnie Hawkins' ex-bandmates, the Hawks, were playing in the area, they made a special point of seeking out Sonny Boy and spent an entire evening backing them up in a juke joint. All through the night, Williamson kept spitting into a coffee can beside him. When Robbie Robertson got up to leave the bandstand during a break, they noticed the can was filled with blood. On May 25, 1965, Curtis and Stackhouse were waiting at the KFFA studios for Sonny Boy to do the daily King Biscuit broadcast. When Williamson didn't show, Curtis left the station and headed to the rooming house where Sonny Boy was staying, only to find them lying in bed, dead of an apparent heart attack. They were buried in the Whitfield Cemetery in Tutwiler, MS, and their funeral was well-attended. As Houston Stackhouse said, “He was well thought of through that country.” They were elected to the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1980.

Move over tequila, here comes Chinese firewater. Baijiu, a flammable, pungent white liquor averaging a 110-proof wallop, is the world's most consumed spirit, but for the first time distillers are looking to develop export markets.
But Baijiu's punch makes it a tough sell in Western bar culture where people tend to drink on an empty stomach. So does its fuel-like odor and its aftertaste. But the history of regional drinks, such as Japanese sake, or Mexican tequila, shows that nearly any taste can be acquired.
According to data from International Wine & Spirit Research, Chinese people drank over 11 billion liters of baijiu in 2012; the spirit, distilled from sorghum, wheat or rice, accounted for more than one-third of all liquor consumed in the world.
But as a new generation of Chinese drinkers discovers the imported spirits that were unavailable to their parents, baijiu risks losing that market share unless it creates new markets overseas.
"Baijiu hasn't been marketed to the West yet but I think it can be," said James Rice, managing director of Sichuan Swellfun Co Ltd, a baijiu maker in Chengdu, western China, in which London-based beverage multinational Diageo has taken a sizeable stake.
"People are interested in China and here's a piece of Chinese culture that can go right to your dinner table."
The opportunity has also attracted small entrepreneurs like David Zhou, who founded Washington-based Everest Distillery to import a Chinese baijiu and rebrand it for sale locally.
"We really want to go for mainstream U.S. consumers and we do believe they can accept it."
But Rice, and other distillers, have to deal with a major challenge: baijiu tends to make a terrible first impression.
"I thought it tasted like paint-thinner and felt like a liquid lobotomy," said Michael Pareles, manager at the U.S. Meat Export Federation in Beijing. "However, like many other things in China, I eventually grew to like it."
Torsten Stocker, head of Greater China consumer practice at Monitor Group in Hong Kong, was skeptical about prospects for overseas expansion.
But they suggested the liquor could be better distributed to the swelling overseas Chinese community, which now depends on duty-free stores in airports to stay stocked.
However, selling the rest of the world on baijiu will be challenging. "Tequila has a very unusual flavor compared to more popular spirits," said Derek Sandhaus, industry consultant and author of a forthcoming book on baijiu appreciation.
"But through clever marketing, good cocktails, and good management, it's earned a place on the bar shelf. I see no reason why the world's most popular spirit can't do the same."
But an adjustment is still probably necessary.
Matt Trusch, a former China resident, founded a distillery called Byejoe USA that imports baijiu base from China, then re-filters it to make it more drinkable.
"We've made it much more palatable to American tastes."
Vinn Distilleries in Portland, Oregon, founded by a family of ethnic Chinese immigrants from Vietnam, is reproducing a generation-old baijiu recipe, and Vinn president Michelle Ly has marketed it - in very small volumes - to non-Chinese consumers.
Curiously enough, they said a group of investors had approached them with an idea to export their U.S.-made baijiu back to China, advertising it as a product of high quality control - an issue domestic baijiu brands have struggled with.
Baijiu expert Sandhaus thinks the best avenue for developing drinkers overseas is to follow the model of Japanese sake and market baijiu as the alcohol to drink with Chinese food. But they added that there is no need for distillers to rush.
"It will still be a very long time before baijiu stops being a very lucrative business in China."
A coalition of local and national media outlets has intervened in court to call for broader transparency and increased access to legal documents in the prosecution of the Baltimore police officers in the arrest and death of Freddie Gray.
The coalition, which includes The Baltimore Sun, filed a memorandum on Tuesday in support of its intervention in the case and is asking for access to sealed documents, trial transcripts, evidence, and future moments during trials when jurors leave the courtroom to view evidence. It also asked the court to refrain from admonishing jurors not to talk about their experiences after their service is concluded, as Judge Barry G. Williams did with jurors in the recently concluded trial of Officer William G. Porter.
"Especially in a case like this, it's critical that the process be as transparent as possible, and we think there are a number of areas where transparency can be improved," said Nathan Siegel, an attorney for the media coalition. "They are issues that came up in the course of the first Porter trial. We thought the best thing to do was to try to address them now before the same issues arise" in the subsequent trials.
On Sunday The Sun reported that sealed documents were being filed in the officers' cases, and that Williams had asked the 12-member jury panel in Porter's trial not to talk about their experiences after the trial's conclusion. On Tuesday, additional sealed documents were discovered in Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr.'s case.
During Porter's trial, reporters were not allowed to observe jurors as they looked at the van in which 25-year-old Gray suffered a fatal spinal cord injury while in police custody in April. Reporters were allowed to view evidence submitted during the trial at the end of each day, but were not provided copies of photographic and audio-visual evidence, as the new motions request.
The memorandum, filed in the Porter case, noted the coalition would seek similar relief in the remaining trials of the officers. Porter, whose trial ended last month with a hung jury, is scheduled to be retried this summer. Goodson, the driver of the police van in which Gray was injured, is set to go to trial next, starting with jury selection on Monday.
In addition to the Sun, the media coalition includes Bloomberg News, Hearst Stations, Inc., ABC News, Associated Press, CBS News, CNN, Fox News, The Guardian, NBC News, Sinclair Broadcast, Inc., The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, WJZ, WMAR, and the Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press.
The media coalition argued that any direction to jurors that they not discuss their experiences after the conclusion of their service would be an "unconstitutional prior restraint" on free speech.
The coalition noted that the court denied transcripts from the Porter case under a 2010 administrative order — issued amid the trial of then-Mayor Sheila Dixon for embezzling gift cards — that transcripts would not be provided by the court until "a decision, verdict or judgment has been reached in the case."
The coalition noted that, to its knowledge, no other Circuit Court in the state operates under a similar rule, and said the 2010 order violates the First Amendment because it does not present a "compelling reason" for why it was needed, nor was it tailored narrowly either in scope or duration. It said one unacceptable outcome of the rule is that parties to court proceedings in Baltimore can request bench conferences — discussions at the judge's bench that can't be heard in open court — and "effectively shield that portion of any proceeding from public access until the entire case is over, or potentially forever."
Such bench conferences have been common in pre-trial motions hearings in the officers' cases and during the Porter trial.
The coalition argued that the press have a "presumptive right" to court documents, and that the sealing of documents to-date in the Porter and Goodson cases has been done so without regard to Maryland requirements that notice be given and that the process of sealing documents be narrowly tailored.
"In both the Porter and Goodson cases, it would appear that these procedures were not followed," it wrote. "Moreover, it would appear very unlikely that a 'compelling' state interest exists that could support the wholesale sealing of entire categories of motions such as 'discovery disputes.'"
The court had previously acknowledged that it had told the parties in the Goodson case to file all motions related to discovery disputes under seal.
The media also have a "presumptive right" to transcripts and to copy evidence, the group wrote.

"Operation Ranch Hand" has an almost innocuous ring to it, but nothing could be further from the truth. From 1961 to 1971, under its umbrella, southern Vietnam became the dumping ground for almost 20 million gallons of herbicides and defoliants. Intended to kill enemy crops and decimate jungles in which the Viet Cong and North Vietnam Army (NVA) sought cover, the toxins were sprayed over some 16 percent of the country.
The most widely spread among them was the dioxin, Agent Orange. As Air Force pilots dropped it over swathes of foliage – at rates of up to 14 km in less than five minutes - they planted a problem with roots that have no immediately visible end: the health impact of exposure to their toxic cargo.
In the years following the spraying sorties, as both veterans and the Vietnamese population began to record increased rates of cancer, digestive, respiratory and skin disorders, as well as miscarriage and birth defects, questions about a correlation inevitably emerged.
Subsequent scrutiny of the specification of Agent Orange failed to produce evidence of anything that seemed a likely cause for the catalogue of symptoms. But further analysis of production samples showed contaminants to be a plausible source of the ill health. The dangerous compound was, in fact, a by-product.
More at work than Agent Orange?
As second, and now third generation children continue to be born with a high incidence of disability, including down's syndrome, cerebral palsy and extreme facial disfigurement, the questions regarding its potency and reach remain on the table. And are very hard to answer.
Many make a direct link between Agent Orange and birth defects in Vietnam
Jeanne Mager Stellman, Columbia University expert on the use of Agent Orange and other herbicides during the Vietnam War, has spent decades campaigning for the recognition of the health implications of dioxins - one of the most poisonous substances known - but says a lack of comprehensive research into the subject makes pinpointing their precise nature notoriously difficult.
"Despite all the certainty that everyone attaches to the diseases and the birth defects people are seeing, we really haven't sorted out exactly what the long-range impacts are," they told DW.
"Agent Orange raises a flag," Stellman continued, "but the other herbicides used were not benign." They cite Agent Blue as arsenical and an inhibitor to folic acid, which pregnant women are advised to take to ensure good fetal development.
Richard Guthrie, analyst on chemical and biological warfare, agrees it is important not to forget the possible effects of Agent Blue and Agent White, both of which were sprayed from 1966 onwards, but says they are "satisfied beyond reasonable doubt" that Agent Orange has had a lasting effect on the health of members of the Vietnamese population.
Equally, they describe as "very plausible" the suggestion that the dioxin is the direct cause of birth defects in children being born in the country today.
Divided opinions on the ground
But that is not the united view in Vietnam itself. Nick Keegan, Director of Business Development at the Kianh Foundation, which works with special needs children in the district of Dien Ban, told DW that even those whose children are born with disabilities attribute them to different causes.
The Vietnam war, in which more than three million people are believed to have been killed, ended forty years ago this week
"We have dealt with families who feel it is directly related to Agent Orange, but some, for cultural and spiritual reasons, think they have just been unlucky."
Of the 200,000 strong population in Dien Ban, more than 1,000 children are registered disabled. Keegan says there is no conclusive proof of a link between that figure and the dioxin, but admits that evidence of heavy bombing of the area during the war makes them stop and think.
"To have 1,000 children plus with disabilities is quite a high number, so you start to question the contributing factors," they said.
Inheritable changes to DNA?
The World Health Oganization (WHO) says once dioxins enter the body, "they last a long time because of their chemical stability and their ability to be absorbed by fat tissue." It gives them an estimated half life, which is the time needed to reduce concentration by half, of between 7 to 11 years.
Stellman, who says this gradual disappearence makes research all the more difficult, insists the real scientific question about dioxin is whether it exerts epigenetic effects -- changes in DNA and possibly RNA -- that are not mutations but other changes to the chemical structure, and whether these changes can be passed on for more than one generation.
"In the case of Vietnam, how much of this epigenetic change travels through the paternal line and is heritable?"
When trying to understand the pattern of birth defects, they also say it is essential to look at other factors - such as starvation, stress, parasitic disease, and the contemporary use of pesticides - where links have already been established.
No study in sight
Is the grass as green as it looks?
The only way to better understand exactly what is going on in Vietnam and the extent to which Agent Orange is a factor in children's disabilities, is to conduct expansive research. That would not only require significant investment, but political engagement that Stellman regards as lacking.
"There is willful blocking by some elements of the US government," they said, adding there are also "potent forces" against a comprehensive investigation in Vietnam, which as an exporter of catfish and other food items doesn't want to give the world the idea that it is polluted with dioxin.
Against that backdrop, they question whether such a study will ever happen. "The longer we wait, the more difficult it becomes," they said. "While everyone is arguing about the number of angels on the pinhead - no one is seriously addressing the underlying issue itself. It is all a large human tragedy."
Deputy Prime Minister Zahid Hamidi today refuted claims that the government's aim to bring in 1.5 million Bangladeshi workers is profit oriented.
On the other hand, they said the decision was made based on the demand from the employers association itself who were prompted to opt for foreign workers from Bangladesh.
"To date, from the worker profile, no prejudice, loyalty of Bangladeshi workers much better than workers from other countries, more trustworthy, for example, looking after counters and petrol stations.
"Let's not be too easy to accuse that this is about money, this is about modern slavery..the government always endeavour to find means so that these situations do not take place," they said when winding up the debate on the 2016 Supply Bill at the Dewan Rakyat in Kuala Lumpur today.
They also told the Dewan that the entry of 1.5 million foreign workers from Bangladesh had yet to take place because the government had not signed any agreement related to the matter.
On June 25, Ahmad Zahid, who is also Home Minister, was reported to have said that 1.5 million foreign workers from Bangladesh would be brought to Malaysia in stages in the next three years to meet the needs of employers from numerous sectors.
They were also reported to have said the move would only be made after illegal foreign workers here were deported.
On terrorism, Ahmad Zahid said, to date, 179 people who were involved with elements of terrorism, including 136 of them who were involved with the Islamic State (IS) elements, had been detained since 2013 until Nov 2.
They said, of the total, 15 were civil servants and Armed Forces personnel.
On another matter, Zahid said Malaysia's success in deradicalisation of individuals, who were involved in militant and terrorism violence, also received the attention of other nations.
They said Malaysia had started its rehabilitation programme on former communist members since 1948 and not less than 97 per cent had been rehabilitated.
Now the programme was used to rehabilitate those who were involved in militant and terrorism violence, they said.
"Our deradicalisation programme has become a template for many nations," they said.
They said the nation's success in this aspect was also recognised by other countries when Malaysia was picked to host the deradicalisation conference on Jan 25-26 next year.

Clarisse Thorn recently interviewed famous pickup artist Neil Strauss, author of The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup artists.
Strauss had some interesting quotes about feminism and the Gunwitch shooting:
CT: So how do you feel about feminism?
NS: I'm definitely not an expert, but it's splintered into so many things that I can barely define feminism. There can be people who are feminist, and people who hold the completely opposite view but are still feminists. It seems to me from the outside that there's a lot of people busy fighting each other rather than working toward their goals. It's a shame. Maybe you can tell me what feminism is.
CT: I think feminism is focused on providing positive choices and encouraging respect for women, but it's different things to different people. I'm on the sex-positive end of the spectrum, with a lot of focus on sexual freedom.
NS: Right, so there's sex-positive and then there's Catherine MacKinnon. Is Jenna Jameson a feminist? Is Catherine MacKinnon a feminist? I don't know.
CT: A lot of pickup artists talk about how much they hate feminism.
NS: Here's the deal. Anyone who hates something feels threatened by it. A guy who says they hate feminism (a) doesn't understand or know feminism, and (b) is scared of powerful women. Most attacks come from fear.
CT: You heard about the Gunwitch shooting earlier this year, right? How did you feel about that?
NS: I felt just devastated for the girl and their family. It was horrible. They were an unstable individual. If you look in The Game, he's only mentioned as an extreme element—I mean, their philosophy was “make the ho say no.” I'm surprised it took this long for someone in the community to do something that stupid, but I would never have guessed it would be something that violent.
CT: A lot of feminists came down on the community especially after Gunwitch shot that woman.
NS: That's like when a politician does something bad and people say all politicians are bad. I think a lot of people say stuff about The Game who have never read The Game. Some people feel threatened by it. But when women have problems with the movement, I do understand. We still are a patriarchal society, as you know—men are dominant, and when the dominant group bands together, that's a threatening thing. So, to me, I can see that element of why it's threatening. I understand, but I also think people should explore why they feel threatened and why they feel angry. All my books have been based on my fears. The Game was based on my fears of social and sexual rejection, and Emergency was based on my fears of what's going on in the world. Everyone Loves You When You're Dead is based on the idea that people are threatened by other people, so they shit talk people they see as competition.
BOSTON (CBS) — Integrity.
Integrity.
Integrity.
INTEGRITY!
This is the word spewed as often as possible from the mouths of any NFL executive whenever they're asked to speak.
What about this? Integrity.
What about that? Integrity.
Do you like cheeseburgers? Integrity … with ketchup and mustard.
The question doesn't necessarily have to lend itself to having anything to do with “integrity,” but sure enough, the conversation will always circle back to that one buzzword.
Integrity.
So it's no surprise that when NFL executive vice president Troy Vincent took time to talk with ESPN's Ashley Fox, the “I word” made a fast and furious entrance into the conversation.
Fox asked Vincent what their job duties entail. They didn't really answer with any actual tasks, but they did let you know that he's all about integrity.
“First and foremost, my role in football operations is to protect the integrity and competitive fairness of the professional sport of football,” Vincent said. “There are several aspects to that, such as establishing a culture of clarity, consistency and credibility to players, coaches, clubs and fans in order to develop the future player, preserve and innovate the game and protect the NFL brand. Beyond that, our goal is to provide a world-class game-day experience for players, coaches and fans through innovation and proactively meeting the demands and challenges of the game and its players.
“Our charge is to change the conversation back to what is right about football by celebrating the value of our greater game to those who play it and to society in general. In essence, my role is to preserve the integrity of the game and position it for measurable and responsible future growth.”
The integrity of the game. That's what it's all about.
Vincent has been in the news, of course, since they “recommended” Tom Brady be suspended four games and “recommended” the Patriots be stripped of two draft picks and fined $1 million. Though commissioner Roger Goodell claims to have decided on the punishment himself, the original language of the punishment and Goodell's own explanation at the owners meetings in San Francisco insinuated that it was Vincent's call, with Goodell merely approving it. (Since then, Goodell has taken full responsibility for issuing the punishment, because the NFLPA reminded them that — whoops — only they are allowed to issue that type of punishment.)
By now, we've all learned that no fewer than a dozen mistakes were made by NFL officials and employees the night of the AFC Championship Game. That much was uncovered in the Wells report, though the NFL has done absolutely nothing to accept any blame for:
Referee Bill Leavy overinflating footballs in Week 7 to 16 PSI Referee Walt Anderson losing custody of the footballs prior to the championship game, despite being forewarned ahead of time to be on alert Multiple involved parties leaking news of the “investigation” into the footballs within hours of the game's conclusion Multiple NFL employees leaking false information to ESPN about the PSI measurements, and the league's steadfast refusal to clarify the false information for several months A complete and utter lack of understanding of basic science The failure of all involved parties to properly record the measurements and which gauges were used The head of officiating, Dean Blandino, lying publicly by stating the league did not know of any concerns about footballs until after the game began
That covers some of it, for starters. Instead of accepting blame for any of these actions, the NFL has cast shadows upon Brady and the Patriots, under the guise of “integrity.” Because nothing was proven in the Wells report, we can't know with certainty whether the Patriots employee took air out of the footballs. It certainly seems like they did, based on the circumstantial evidence, but there's no questioning that the punishment issued by the league went far overboard — especially considering how poorly the league handled the situation from the start and how many times NFL employees have lied about what took place.
A commissioner with real integrity would have addressed the situation by saying, “Hey, we think something was going on with the footballs, but we can't be entirely sure. So we're going to issue a fine, as suggested by the NFL rulebook, and a warning to the Patriots that we'll be keeping an eye on this. In the meantime, we've uncovered a number of holes in our own process that could leave open an opportunity for illicit football manipulation. We're going to address these issues on our end and remind clubs that they must abide by all NFL rules.”
That would have cleared up “DeflateGate” in a matter of 86 words. But because this commissioner doesn't like to admit any fault, we are in the sixth month of this “scandal.”
Despite all of this, Vincent is big on integrity. In fact, they wish that dang NFLPA would stop filing lawsuits against the league. Is it because the league just about always loses those cases, therefore weakening the public perception of Goodell and Co.? No, of course not! What an awful, unfair mind you have. You've got no integrity, mister!
Nope — Vincent believes that representing players in their cases against the NFL is a waste of money — money that should be going toward retired and/or injured players that need help.
“Look at the amount of money being spent on legal fees for a handful of people. It's millions and millions of dollars,” Vincent argued. “We've got players that are hurting. We've got young men who don't know how to identify a good financial adviser. Men are in transition who aren't doing well, and yet $8 [million] to $10 million dollars a year is spent in court fees about who should make a decision on someone, who in some cases has committed a crime.
“Think about that logically. Wouldn't it be better to spend our time and resources on the issues that are vital to our players — past, present and future — such as the players' total wellness and growing the game together?”
Excuse me for a moment, but …
OK, I think I'm done, I swear, just …
Sorry about that. But, in all seriousness, Vincent works for an organization that just spent $5 million to investigate the PSI levels of footballs … and failed miserably in that investigation. Not only did $5 million fail to prove anything, it also exposed all of those asupervisorstioned mistakes among NFL employees. And they want the NFLPA to stop paying legal fees for players who by and large win their appeals against the commissioner … because … I don't know. Because of integrity. Sure, that works.
And then there's the second ludicrous takeaway from that statement — the one about the players who are hurting yet not getting money or sound advice from the NFLPA. The NFL makes over $9 billion every year. The NFL makes enough to pay Goodell a salary of $74 million over two years. The NFL makes enough money to essentially light $5 million on fire by hiring Ted Wells to run an “independent investigation” of something that could have been cleared up in a couple of days.
Yet the NFL doesn't like giving that money to players — especially not injured players, who get released as soon as they tear their knees and are sent back to the real world to try to figure it out on their own. The NFL used up everything they needed out of those guys, and it very quickly moves on to the next guy. The NFL would much prefer the NFLPA take care of those players, because the NFL has much bigger fish to fry (fish which were probably caught on a Sunday afternoon pleasure cruise aboard a league executive's yacht).
(We could get into the many, many years which the NFL denied the correlation between smashing heads 50 times every Sunday and sustaining concussions, but we don't have the 10,000 words needed to delve into that topic.)
And here's one more Troy Vincent quote for the road: “I have come to appreciate the strength of Roger's character that causes them to rise higher than the ethics of the current environment that all too often seeks to justify and defend indefensible acts.”
(Please scroll back up to the sound effects of hysterical laughter, if you don't mind.)
Let's take this one apart word-by-word.
Strength. Of. Roger's. Character.
Rise. Higher. Than. The. Ethics. Of. The. Current. Environment.
Oh. My God.
Is this the road the NFL really wants to go down? That Roger is some bastion of integrity, that their morality and ethics are unimpeachable, that their decision-making is based solely in what is right?
Are you serious?
Look, Rog themselves brought it up last month, but after the country turned on them for their absolutely weak punishment of Ray Rice (who used their fist to knock out their then-fiancee), Goodell lied about what they knew and what they were told. What's worse, they tried to paint the bad guy (Rice) as a liar, when in fact even a man who knocked out their future wife in an elevator still was more open and honest than the commissioner of the National Football League.
And when questioned under oath (during one of those pesky, frivolous, expensive lawsuits taken up by the NFLPA), they squirmed, claimed to not know the meanings of simple words, and claimed they hadn't read reports which were presented to them by their staff and which described the incident in detail.
An independent judge ruled that Goodell was lying, and ruled in Rice's favor.
That's the man who rises “higher than the ethics of the current environment that all too often seeks to justify and defend indefensible acts”? On what planet?
This is only partially about DeflateGate. I still think the Patriots employee jabbed a needle in those balls, but given the fact that the PSI levels ended up within an explainable range when the air temperature and timing are taking in account, I believe the amount of air released from the footballs was negligible — making this entire soap opera all the more preposterous.
I also admit that, absent any proof of this action, I may be wrong.
One would think that possessing even a modicum of self-awareness of one's fallibility would figure to be a crucial trait of anyone who claims to have integrity. But that's not just in the NFL's definition of the word. In the NFL world, integrity means that everything the league does is right, and it's foolish to ever doubt that.
After all, folks who say the word “integrity” in every other sentence they speak would never tell a lie, right?

Those showman plays are what have defined Radulov and made them special for a long time, since before they came to North America to play in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League 13 years ago.
Their assist on Shea Weber's game-winning goal, the difference in Montreal taking a 2-1 lead in the best-of-7 series, was equally brilliant for how they read the defense and realized the Canadiens had numbers below the dots.
NEW YORK -- Alexander Radulov's goal was spectacular, the perfect highlight to lead any postgame show detailing the Montreal Canadiens' 3-1 win against the New York Rangers in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference First Round at Madison Square Garden on Sunday.
[RELATED: Complete Rangers vs. Canadiens series coverage | Rangers power play falters again in Game 3 loss]
But defense? Nah, Radulov has never been known for that. Commitment? Not their thing, right?
Wrong. Drop that dated perception of Radulov because it's not true anymore, if it ever was at all.
"He's a guy who really cares," Montreal coach Claude Julien said. "He wants to win and they don't care about anything but winning."
For proof see Radulov's stick check on New York Rangers defenseman Ryan McDonagh in the waning seconds of the second period. Without it, the Canadiens may have entered the third period tied instead of leading 1-0. Without it, the third period could have gone differently for Montreal, and for Radulov.
McDonagh got the puck in transition from J.T. Miller and was in position going into the left circle to shoot while Carey Price was moving from their left to right. Radulov basically said no with a perfect stick check.
"I was just trying to do anything to not let them shoot," Radulov said. "I just tried to put my stick on top of their stick and hold it, put all my weight [on it]. He's a strong guy but eventually they didn't get that shot."
McDonagh was so angry after the play they gave Radulov a whack on the back of their legs with their stick.
"I don't feel anything," Radulov said.
The Rangers felt Radulov's presence all game. They followed their performance in Game 2 at Bell Centre on Friday, when they scored the overtime winner and had three points, with an arguably better and more impactful performance start to finish in Game 3.
They were dominant on the puck and seemed to shrink the Rangers' will against him.
"He's a handful to control and obviously when they can control [the puck] and protect it like they have it draws guys to them and it's going to open up other guys," Canadiens forward Brendan Gallagher said. "As the game goes on the way we play we're just trying to wear teams down and make them work. Every shift is an investment in the series and a guy like Radu is a perfect example. Every shift he's going to come after guys and just make it tough, make 'em work. That stuff usually pays off late in games."
Video: MTL@NYR, Gm3: Radulov nets nifty one-handed goal
It paid off for Radulov in the third period.
They carried the puck into the zone and drew McDonagh and Kevin Hayes to him. They were facing away from the goal but they knew the Canadiens had to have numbers, especially since they were on the power play and two guys were attacking him, so they dropped a pass deeper into the zone to Alex Galchenyuk, setting up a 3-on-2 from the circles in.
Galchenyuk found Weber, who scored on a one-timer from the left circle at 7:42 to give Montreal a 2-0 lead.
"I walked into the zone and I see McDonagh was on me and the other guy come so I kind of thought we're supposed to have a guy in the middle," Radulov said. "I kind of risked it, but we had a power play and we're supposed to have that guy in the middle, which we did."
Next came Radulov's goal at 15:35, a play that started because they were in position on the forecheck to intercept Kevin Klein's pass out of the Rangers' defensive zone.
Radulov brought the puck into the zone and got it to Phillip Danault, who dropped it into the middle where Radulov picked it up in the high slot. Radulov proceeded to stickhandle, deke and shoot with only their right hand on their stick while using their left to fend off Hayes.
"I couldn't do that," Gallagher said, laughing.
Radulov didn't think before they did it.
"It just comes," they said. "I had nothing because the guy was on me and I kind of saw [Henrik] Lundqvist moving with me. I just pulled it back and it went there, so it's good."
They aren't done.
Radulov had two more shifts in the final 2:56 with the Canadiens trying to hold onto a 3-1 lead and Lundqvist on the bench for the extra skater.
They forechecked hard, stole the puck in New York's zone and dumped it in deep with 2:30 left. They dove at the Montreal blue line to poke the puck out of the zone, down the ice with 1:56 left. They got back up, forechecked again and nearly helped Montreal get an empty-net goal.
"If he's on the ice like they were at the end their goal is to get the puck out and he's going to do whatever it took to make those extra plays and to work hard to make sure they did the right thing," Julien said. "It's nice when you've got guys like that who are buying in and doing those things because they're being rewarded at the end."
It will likely take new road tolls and congestion charges and other revenue tools to help deliver “the biggest transit deal in North America, or perhaps the world,” says the man hired to pave the path toward the $4 billion Sheppard Subway. As such, claims that the private sector will step in and build the line on their own are not realistic, says Gordon Chong, ex-city councillor, ex-chair of GO Transit, ex-TTC commissioner and now chair of the Toronto Transit Infrastructure Ltd., the dormant investment arm of the transit company. As well as tolls, there will need to be increased government grants, unprecedented development fees, revenue tools not used here before, plus the public-private partnership Mayor Rob Ford covets in order to make the project happen, Chong said in an interview. As they moved into an empty and surplus section of City Hall this week, Chong's reality check is a sobering reminder of how many hurdles stand in the way of a subway-building future they and others crave. Taxpayers will have to be sold on the matter of tolls.

“People don't like it when you tax them and the money disappears. If you tax them and they can follow the money trail to transit, they won't like it but they will understand it,” they say. “Everybody in the world is paying tolls, what's so special about us?” Chong concedes that a segment of the population — maybe even the Ford administration — believes the private sector will build the Sheppard subway extension wholly on its own, with a little help from the federal infrastructure fund. But that federal fund has only $1.2 billion for the whole country. Sheppard will end up costing as much as four times that amount. Vancouver tapped into the federal government's public-private fund to complete the Canada Lands rail line, but the Sheppard line will cost twice as much.
“Is there going to be the political will to look at all the potential tools? If you want to get back in the subway building plan you have to consider everything,” Chong says. Besides tolls and congestion charges, the plan will need contributions from the federal government. And developers who benefit from the presence of subways near their property should have 20 per cent to 40 per cent of the increased value clawed back development fees, Chong says. “Everything that can potentially generate revenues should be on the table,” Chong says. That's music to the ears. But considering the bent of the current administration, it's also whistling Dixie.

Mayor Ford came to power promising fewer taxes. They promised and succeeded in ending the $65 vehicle registration tax, and they did not divert it to transit — the type of action that will be needed to finance subway building. So, Chong has an uphill task. Can Ford be convinced to embark on a huge subway-building venture, using all the funding tools needed? That would be heavenly. But Chong has to tread carefully. The former city councillor actually supported Rocco Rossi's mayoral bid last year. Still, they were part of Ford's transition team. Now, he's been tossed the hot potato that grew out of Ford's cancellation of Transit City — the plan to put light rail lines down the middle of six or more major streets. Ford wants transit lines underground, and Chong agrees. Beyond that, their relationship will be tested in the coming months. Chong has advertised for a consultant to do a preliminary testing of what it takes to deliver the project and report by August. Following that, a comprehensive plan — costing as much as $6 million and lasting six months to a year — will define the financing model, revenue tools, planning regime and zoning changes needed, station locations, ridership projections, and funding sources. “It will define all the things to get the private sector to invest in the project, to go to the financing firms and say, ‘Here's what you need to decide if you can invest in this,'” they say. “The private sector folks are no fools. They are not going to throw money at something that doesn't make sense.” Royson James usually appears Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Email: rjames@thestar.ca
LMP1 preview FIA World Endurance Championship in Silverstone, round 1 of 9
High tension expected for first duel of the season
Stuttgart.
An Oceanside man will spend the rest of their life behind bars for setting the fire that killed theirs wife.
Gertrude Hollis, 74, tried to crawl into a bathtub and turn on the water as a means of escaping a mobile home fire in February 2015.
Them husband, Andrew Hollis, set the fire in the couple's home at the Lamplighter Mobile Home Park on North River Road.
When Oceanside firefighters arrived, they found Gertrude Hollis in the back bathroom with the water running.
Deadly Mobile Home Fire
A mobile home fire in Oceanside left one dead and another in the hospital. Family and neighbors gathered at the house after learning of the sad news. NBC 7's Matt Rascon reports live. (Published Monday, Feb. 23, 2015)
Outside the home, firefighters found Andrew suffering from smoke inhalation and serious burns to their face and upper body.
Officials told NBC 7 the next day that they had begged emergency crews to rescue their wife and stepson.
The stepson was found hours later unharmed.
Andrew Hollis was sentenced Tuesday to life in prison without parole for the murder of their wife.
Daughter Vera Cunningham described their mother as the glue that held the family together.
They wore their mother's watch and scarf to the sentencing hearing. When Hollis spoke, they offered no remorse, they said.
Oceanside Family Mourns Loss of Woman in Fire
An Oceanside family is mourning the loss of their grandmother after a fire broke out in their mobile home. NBC 7's Omari Fleming reports. (Published Monday, Feb. 23, 2015)
“That they took our mother's life the way that they did,” Cunningham said. “He had every opportunity to save our mom and they didn't.”
The Oceanside Fire and Police departments worked with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to solve the suspicious fire, which burned the home Andrew and Gertrude had lived in for more than 30 years, according to neighbors.
Rulon Clark Allred (March 29, 1906 – May 10, 1977) was a homeopath and chiropractor in Salt Lake City and the founder/leader of what is now the Apostolic United Brethren, a breakaway sect of polygamous Mormon fundamentalists in Utah, Colorado, Montana, and Arizona, United States. They were murdered on the orders of Ervil LeBaron, the head of a rival polygamous sect (Wikipedia).
Vance Allred is Rulon's Allred's son, and at one point was a chief apologist for Mormon fundamentalist polygamy, and was being groomed to succeed their father as prophet of the AUB. In this three part series, Vance Allred discusses:
Part 1: Their father's rise to power, via the founding of the Apostolic United Brethren, and Vance's early years as the son of a polygamist prophet.
Part 2: The events leading up to Rulon Allred's assassination, and Vance's candid critique of their father's work, and
Part 3: The sexual abuse in the AUB that led Vance to leave the AUB, and the events that led Vance to join the LDS church (requiring an interview with two LDS apostles). Finally, Vance discusses the factors that led to them becoming inactive LDS.

Bernie Sanders Drops Truth Bomb On GOP's Obamacare Repeal Effort (VIDEO)
Share On FacebookTweet Post
Bernie Sanders to GOP: Your Obamacare repeal effort is “a waste of time.”
Never ones to miss a chance to launch yet another doomed Obamacare repeal effort, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY-Jelly) and their gang of 53 are up to their old tricks again. Oh, and this time, their bill revokes funding for Planned Parenthood, too. The Huffington Post reports:
Republicans will use a special budgetary tool, known as reconciliation, to take up a bill that would gut most of Obamacare. By using reconciliation, they only need 51 votes to pass it, and Republican leadership is confident they have the votes. The House already passed their version of the bill in late October.
A “special budgetary tool” wielded by some very special tools? Well, isn't this special. So which Obamacare repeal effort is it this time? Nobody really seems to know. Huffpo says there's “some disagreement” on the number of attempts; Rachel Maddow declares they've done it so many danged times she's lost count, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) guesses “50-something,” and Raw Story came up with 61 tries (though that was way back in October).
What ever happened to the good old days when the Republican party was all about making our government more efficient and cost-effective? Now all they do is waste time and taxpayer's money trying to shut down the U.S. government and gut programs the American people support. No wonder a furious Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) took to the Senate floor to blast their GOP colleagues from here to Kingdom Come.
“This bill should tell every American just how far removed the Republican leadership here in Congress is from the realities of American life and the needs of the American people.”
They went on to point out that we're “the only major country on earth” that doesn't guarantee access to healthcare for all of our citizens and that despite the ACA's success, we still have 29 million people who lack health insurance (thanks to GOP governors refusing to expand Medicaid) and more who can't afford their prescriptions and who have high deductibles. But really, as Sanders thunders at their colleagues, the whole thing's a damned “waste of time.”
“Furthermore, it's a total waste of time I think everybody here in the Senate understands this, the bill we are debating today is a complete waste of time. This is just another reason why the American people have so little respect for the Congress.”
Given all the “major crises facing our country” and the world today, don't our Senate Republicans have something better to do than launch yet another doomed Obamacare repeal effort?
“There are major crises facing our country and the Republican leadership once again is attempting to repeal Obamacare. I kind of lost track about how many times this effort has been made. I think in the House it was over fifty. I don't know how many it is here in the Senate.”
Oh and in case Bernie Sanders' GOP colleagues in the Senate have forgotten, Obama will just strike that bill down with a big fat VETO…again.
“So let me break the news to my Republican colleagues, although I am sure that they already got the news. And that is Obama is not going to sign a bill repealing Obamacare. I think that is not likely to happen, and what we are doing today is just a waste of time.”
But if the GOP insists on going ahead with their Obamacare repeal effort, Sanders wants to make sure we all know: If the GOP ever succeeds in taking people's health insurance away, some will die because as a result.
“The last thing we need is a budget reconciliation bill that throws 17 million Americans off of health insurance and denies nearly 3 million women the health care they need by defunding Planned Parenthood […] When you throw 17 million people off health insurance, people will die because they don't go to a doctor when they should, they don't get into the hospital when they should.”
So now that Bernie Sanders has had their say, let Mitch McConnell explain why it's okay to take away people's health insurance (as may happen in their home state when its new GOP governor-elect Matt Bevin takes office) and leave some of them to get sick and die.
Watch Bernie Sanders shame their GOP colleagues into oblivion.

DEMRE, Turkey — In the fourth century A.D., a bishop named Nicholas transformed the city of Myra, on the Mediterranean coast of what is now Turkey, into a Christian capital.
Nicholas was later canonized, becoming the St. Nicholas of Christmas fame. Myra had a much unhappier fate.
After some 800 years as an important pilgrimage site in the Byzantine Empire it vanished — buried under 18 feet of mud from the rampaging Myros River. All that remained was the Church of St. Nicholas, parts of a Roman amphitheater and tombs cut into the rocky hills.
But now, 700 years later, Myra is reappearing.
Archaeologists first detected the ancient city in 2009 using ground-penetrating radar that revealed anomalies whose shape and size suggested walls and buildings. Over the next two years they excavated a small, stunning 13th-century chapel sealed in an uncanny state of preservation. Carved out of one wall is a cross that, when sunlit, beams its shape onto the altar. Inside is a vibrant fresco that is highly unusual for Turkey.

WASHINGTON -- Former Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd is having a tough first year as chief of Hollywood's powerhouse lobbying organization.
Dodd, who marks their first anniversary in March as chairperson and CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America, is struggling to recover from a stinging defeat they suffered earlier this month at the hands of Internet companies, the Obama administration and Congress in their signature campaign for new laws to thwart online piracy of U.S. movies and other intellectual property.
They then provoked an uproar by threatening retribution against lawmakers who opposed anti-piracy bills. No more Hollywood campaign contributions for them, they warned. Critics pounced and accused them of bribery, demanding an investigation from the Obama administration.
At the heart of all of this were two pieces of legislation, pushed by the MPAA, that would allow the federal government to shut down websites that sell pirated goods or violate copyrights. Both bills had bipartisan support and an eventual House-Senate compromise appeared likely.
But all of that swiftly evaporated when critics of the bills, contending the legislation would stifle innovation and free speech on the Internet, rallied opposition and triggered a flash fire of emails, telephone calls and letters inundating Washington offices.
Suddenly, second thoughts popped up inside the Beltway. The White House issued a statement criticizing the legislation. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairperson of the House Judiciary Committee, announced they were canceling plans to move ahead with the legislation. Both lawmakers agreed that Internet piracy should be dealt with, but maybe not right now and not with those two bills.
It was a huge setback for the new MPAA boss, who now seems to be trying to figure out what hit him. At the Sundance Film Festival last week in Utah, Dodd said the Internet outcry against the bills was "a watershed event." They said the ability of opponents of the bills "to organize and communicate directly with consumers" was unprecedented and created "hysteria" that somehow the bills would destroy the Internet. "We've got to find a better way" to figure out how to deal with online piracy, they declared.
`DON'T ASK' FOR CHECKS
Shortly after assuming the MPAA post at a reported annual base salary of $1.5 million, Dodd declared that the "single biggest threat we face as an industry is movie theft." In remarks to the National Association of Theatre Owners -- another Hollywood trade association -- Dodd made fighting online piracy their major goal and vowed to push for stronger laws to protect film and other intellectual property from unauthorized use. They compared free downloading of films to "looting."
"After three decades in Congress, I have some idea how to attract the attention of a member of congress or senator," they said back then. Dodd, 67, the son of a former senator, served in the U.S. Senate for 30 years until they decided not to seek a fifth term. They had previously been elected to three terms in the House from the state's 2nd Congressional District.
Indeed, it was their Washington insider resume that made Dodd an attractive candidate for the MPAA job in the first place. After the trade group hired him, Fox Filmed Entertainment co-chairperson Jim Gianopulos triumphantly declared: "Senator Dodd is a battle-tested leader whose reputation as a strong leader on major issues facing this country has prepared them to serve as the ambassador for the movie business."
Earlier this month, after the White House and congressional leaders backed away from the pending MPAA-backed anti-piracy bills, Dodd revealed more details about their idea of attracting the attention of a member of congress or a senator.
Irked by the setback, Dodd told Fox News that the movie industry "is watching very carefully who's going to stand up for them when their job is at stake," adding ominously: "Don't ask me to write a check for you when you think your job is at risk and then don't pay any attention to me when my job is at stake."
Foes of the anti-piracy legislation seized on those comments to ask the White House to investigate whether the former senator had violated any laws. Using an Obama administration outreach device titled "We the People," a petition quickly met the White House threshold of 25,000 signatures within 30 days, obliging the administration to respond.
The petition charges that Dodd's comments "are an open admission of bribery and a threat designed to provide a specific policy goal. This is a brazen flouting of the `above the law' status of people of Dodd's position and wealth enjoy."
The petition asks the administration to "investigate this blatant bribery and indict every person, especially government officials and lawmakers, who is involved."
The White House response to the petition, expected next month, could determine Dodd's future effectiveness as the film industry's spokesperson.
One critic of the anti-piracy bills, Craig Aaron of the Free Press Action Fund, declared, "The MPAA is so brazen in its efforts to buy legislation with campaign cash that its leader, themselves a former senator, sees nothing wrong with threatening legislators on national TV. We think it's time that Congress showed that its votes are no longer for sale." Aaron demanded that members of Congress return "the MPAA's tainted campaign cash or give it to charity."
Dodd declined to be interviewed about the uproar triggered by their Fox News interview. Their spokesperson, Howard Gantman, issued a statement that read: "Senator Dodd was merely making the obvious point that people support politicians whose views coincide with their own. When politicians take positions that people disagree with, those people tend not to support those politicians."
Gianopulos, the Fox executive who boasted last year about Dodd's glittering Beltway credentials, also did not respond to a request for comment about the interview.
LOTS OF LOBBYING
The MPAA is no novice when it comes to influencing the federal government. The industry group spent $1.29 million on lobbying in Washington during the first three quarters of 2011, and its political action committee made $41,000 in campaign contributions during the same period, according to public records analyzed by the Center for Responsive Politics.
In fact, the anti-piracy controversy appears to have fueled an explosion in Beltway lobbying. Companies on both sides of the controversy spent at least $104.6 million on lobbying in the fourth quarter, up from $49.3 million in the third quarter, according to CRP, though these companies had many issues pending in Washington and it isn't possible to specify how much lobbying was devoted to the anti-piracy controversy.
Dodd is not a registered lobbyist, according to the most recent public records. In fact, they are barred by Senate revolving-door rules from lobbying their former colleagues for two years after leaving the Senate.  They are not prohibited from lobbying the House or the executive branch.
Meanwhile, both sides in the piracy controversy are looking ahead to the next chapter. Dodd and the film industry face formidable opposition from the tech industry, which is no slouch in mustering its own political and financial heft to get the attention of lawmakers. Corporate foes of the two bills include Google, Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia and Mozilla. Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia, hinted that MPAA should bid Dodd farewell because of their comments to Fox News. MPAA's heavyweight allies included the Hollywood studios, the Recording Industry Association of America and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Some kind of compromise may emerge later this year, after a cooling-off recess, though the unprecedented public intervention into the debate makes it unlikely that it will come from a closed-door meeting of lawmakers on different sides of the issue.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Dodd's successor in the Senate, voted in committee for the Senate version of the anti-piracy bill, but they have said that any final legislation should reflect a balance between the need to crackdown on piracy while protecting "American creativity and innovation."
While Dodd and the MPAA lick their wounds and ponder their next move, they can take comfort in the fact that many critics of the two bills say they agree with Dodd's goal of stopping movie theft. As an example of the scope of the problem, Dodd has said, the movie "Avatar" was stolen by online pirates 21 million times.
Gantman, speaking for Dodd, said the debate "has made one very significant step toward a solution: The online community now agrees there is a problem. We're open to speak with all parties who are interested in a real solution to a problem that poses a serious threat to the 19 million American workers whose jobs depend on intellectual property."
The Florida Senate approved a bill Friday that would reform civil forfeiture and reduce wrongful seizures of personal property. Under current law officers can seize a person's property if they suspect it was gained as a result of or might be used in criminal activity.
The owner of seized property does not currently have to be arrested in order for a police officer to seize their or their property.
“If you told the average person that the government could seize their property through civil asset forfeiture without ever making an arrest, they would be shocked,” said Senator Jeff Brandes who introduced the bill. “This legislation makes sweeping changes to civil forfeiture and institutes major consumer protections to prevent abuses against the property rights of Floridians. The legislation passed today represents the work of a coalition of reform advocates including civil libertarian organizations and law enforcement, and I look forward to the favorable consideration of this bill by the House.”
An identical bill needs approval in the Florida House before heading to Governor Rick Scott's Desk.
The bill would require any seizure of a person's assets to coincide with an arrest. If an arrest is not made, the property cannot be taken. Those types of property seized by law enforcement typically include things like cash, cars, jewelry and even homes. There would be limited exceptions to that rule.
The bill also requires law enforcement agencies taking possession of a person's property to demonstrate probably cause in court within 10 days after the seizure. It also increases the cost of filing fees, implements a $1,500 bond payable to the claimant if the forfeiture is not successful.
The provisions are intended to protect property owners from unlawful seizures by ensuring law enforcement agencies are sure the assets are appropriate for forfeiture by making the process more expensive. The bond is intended to compensate claimants for costs associated with reclaiming their property. Under current law it is often not worthwhile for a person to spend potentially thousands of dollars to claim property worth less than the cost to retrieve it.
Law enforcement leaders and prosecutors were originally against civil forfeiture reform measures, but a recent compromise ensured those agencies could still utilize the process while still protecting property rights. A similar measure with even more restrictions failed in the legislature last year.
This year's bill comes as the issue gains national attention. The U.S. Department of Justice recently Justice announced the restructuring of federal asset forfeiture protocols. The Institute for Justice has also criticized Florida's current law giving is a “D” rating.
Civil forfeiture reform is a national policy priority for the Drug Policy Alliance. The group targeted Florida.
“This is a tremendous step towards reforming Florida's outdated forfeiture laws. The unanimity of the Senate vote speaks volumes to the necessity of these important reforms. DPA hopes that the House acts quickly to pass this law when it meets next week,” said DPA senior staff attorney Theshia Naidoo on the bill's passage in the Senate.
The bill has also attracted support from some key players in Florida politics.
“This legislation heads to the House with consensus amongst both parties, law enforcement, and reform advocates,” said DPA lobbyist Ron Book. “We hope the House will act with the same unanimity that the Senate just did.”
Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri recently spoke in favor of the bill in a Senate committee hearing. And in an op-ed published in the Daytona Beach News Journal, Flagler County Sheriff Jim Manfre also supported the bill.
HB 889 and SB 1044 seek to correct some issues with forfeiture, and do so in a way that still allows sheriffs and police departments to utilize this important crime-fighting tool.” Manfre wrote.
The bill has even earned support from a high-profile Republican, Americans for Tax Reform founder Grover Norquist.
“Florida is not a tin pot dictatorship. It is also not a dystopia. It is an American state that has demonstrated respect for the taxpayer and respect for the rule of law,” they said.

Birmingham City are considering an approach for out-of-favour Aston Villa striker Libor Kozak .
The 26-year-old is way down the pecking order at Villa and has yet to make a single appearance in the Premier League this season.
In recent times Kozak hasn't even made the matchday 18 and he's thought to be open to a temporary move away to help rebuild their career.
Blues are desperate to sign another forward before the emergency loan window closes on Thursday as Clayton Donaldson has been ruled out for the next six weeks with an injury.
Kozak is one of a number of options under consideration and if Villa agree to let them depart boss Gary Rowett will act fast.
Arsenal's Alex Iwobi, 19, is also a player who Blues have looked at but they're believed to favour the Czech Republic hitman as they have top-flight experience both in England and Italy.
poll loading Libor Kozak: A good signing for Birmingham City? 500+ VOTES SO FAR Yes No
Kozak arrived at Villa for £4.5million back in September 2013 but after bagging four goals in 10 starts they broke their leg around the Christmas period.
The ex-Lazio ace then missed 19 months of action and only returned to full fitness this summer.
They looked impressive in the pre-season period but then failed to break their way into ex-boss Tim Sherwood's first-team plans at the start of the season.
New manager Remi Garde has also left them out of the squad for their first two games in charge as Jordan Ayew, Rudy Gestede and Scott Sinclair are preferred uo front.
Kozak's opportunities at Villa will be further diminished when Gabby Agbonlahor returns from a calf injury so a loan move might be the best way forward for him.
The interviewee is a young fighter from Jabhat al-Nusra, an extremist Sunni group in Syria affiliated with al-Qaeda in Iraq. A former teacher and then tiler, they are dressed in well-ironed black trousers, a white shirt and a black turban. A gun rests on their lap.  They are accompanied by an older man, who appears to be judging them on their answers. Both are Syrian and ask not to be named because they do not have permission to speak to the press.
How has Jabhat al-Nusra become so powerful?
Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.
The reason is the weakening of the other groups. Jabhat al-Nusra gets the advantage because of our ideology. We are not just rebels; we are doing something we believe in. We are not just fighting against tyranny; Bashar Assad is only part of our fight. The other groups are only a reaction to the regime, whereas we are fighting for a vision.
What is that vision?
We are fighting to apply what Allah said to the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. We are fighting so people don't look to other people but only to Allah. We don't believe in complete freedom: it is restricted by Allah's laws. Allah created us and they know what is best for us.
What future do you see for Syria—or do you even see a Syria in the future?
We want the future that Islam commands. Not a country with borders but an umma [worldwide Islamic community of believers] of all the Muslim people. All Muslims should be united.
Syria has long been known for its sectarian diversity. How do you view the other sects?
The other sects are protected by the Islamic state. Muhammad, peace be upon him, had a Jewish neighbour, for example, and they were always good to him. But the power and authority must be with the believers [Sunnis], not the unbelievers.
What about other Sunnis who are more moderate than you?
We will apply sharia law to them.
What about Alawites?
Allah knows what will happen to them. There is a difference between the basic kuffar [infidels] and those who converted from Islam. If the latter, we must punish them. Alawites are included. Even Sunnis who want democracy are kuffar as are all Shia. It's not about who is loyal and who isn't to the regime; it's about their religion. Sharia says there can be no punishment of the innocent and there must be punishment of the bad; that's what we follow.
Did you lose or gain fighters following the announcement that you are linked to al-Qaeda in Iraq?
We're with anything that represents real Islam, whether al-Qaeda or otherwise. If there is a better group, we'll go with them instead. The effect of the announcement is that now we know our friends and our enemies. The good people will come to our side and the bad people will leave.
Many, maybe most, Syrians do not share your views. Do you care?
It would be great if the Syrians were with us but the kuffar are not important. Abraham and Sarah were facing all the infidels, for example, but they were doing the right thing. The number with us doesn't matter.
Which other rebel groups do you see as acceptable? Ahrar al-Sham, another Salafist group, criticised your links to al-Qaeda.
I think only 5% of the battalions are against the Islamic vision. Ahrar al-Sham are a mixture of Islamists and people who like Allah so we are not sure about their vision. We are very clear as the Prophet, peace be upon him, made it very clear to us. Other groups have good beliefs but we are the only committed ones.
Will the differences lead to clashes, as have happened in some places? And how would you react if Western powers decide to arm other rebel groups?
If the arms reach people who will fight Assad and Hizbullah that's okay. If they use them against us, then that's a problem. We'll avoid fighting [other groups] if we can. The West wants to ruin Syria.
How hard is it to become a member of Jabhat al-Nusra?
We examine those who want to join. First you must be loyal to the idea of Jabhat al-Nusra. Second, you must get a recommendation [from someone in the organisation]. Third, you go to a camp to be educated and practice, and take the oath of loyalty to the emir [the group's leader].
Do you plan to carry out operations against the West in the future?
There is no permanent friendship and no permanent enemy. We'll do whatever is in the interest of Muslims. The first duty on us is to fight the kuffar among us here in the occupied Muslim lands. The next duty will be decided later.
Do you have contact with the Syrian regime?
If it is in the interest of the Muslims, such as for gas or water, then we have no problem. These matters are in the hands of the emir.
Your presence helps the regime which has long tried to portray the opposition as extremist. What do you think about that?
The regime maybe benefits but in the end we'll show all humans, Syrian and otherwise, the way, and true Islam.
What are your views of women?
The woman in Islam has a special role.  They are respected as a wife, a sister, a mother, a daughter.  They are a jewel we should preserve and look after. In the West they gave women freedom but they use them and don't respect them. The woman is to use in adverts. We don't have an issue with the woman working according to their mind and body. But not jobs that humiliate. Jewellery is okay on women, but not on men, and not too much. Make up should be just for your husband. You can wear coloured clothes and show your face. [The older man disagrees, saying women should cover their face and hands.]
Shouldn't men also cover up to avoid women looking at other people's husbands?
Our women ask the same question. Some men can't control themselves and the woman is the source. It's easier to prevent abuse. The men's role is to go out and work. Man's brain is bigger than the woman's—that's scientifically proven. Men's brains have different areas for speaking and thinking, but women's don't which is why women they say what they think.
What if your interpretation of the Koran is wrong?
There are two types of verse. Firstly ones that are stable and unchanging, such as head-covering. Secondly ones on which people can differ, such as the rule demanding ablution after touching a woman. Does that mean touching their skin or intercourse? Opinions can differ.
Do you consider any Islamists too radical, like the Taliban, for example?
There are people committed to Islam and then those far from it. No one committed is too radical. We haven't met anyone from the Taliban but they seem good Muslims because they defended their religion and the occupation, they kicked out the enemy and applied sharia.
Did you study religion?
I was poor but I read the Bible, and lots of Jewish and Islamic books. My head and heart told me to accept the Koran and the Sunna [accompanying religious texts]. Islam is different because it has a complete view of life, society, politics, economics—it is a complete system.
We hear there is a split inside Jabhat al-Nusra about your links to al-Qaeda. Do you disagree about that or other matters?
There are small differences, but when we give loyalty, we obey.
CNN's Marc Lamont Hill has stated repeatedly, these attacks are myths… See this former U.S.A Today article
San Diego, CA – Authorities on Wednesday circulated surveillance camera images of a youth sought for beating up a 52-year-old man at a La Mesa transit depot.
The victim had just exited a trolley about 8 p.m. June 13 when the assailant jumped him, punching them until they fell to the ground and then kicking them in the head, according to police.
By the time officers arrived, the attacker had fled, Lt. Angela DeSarro said. Police do not know why the victim was targeted.
The man, whose name was withheld, was taken to Alvarado Hospital, where they were treated for non-life-threatening injuries.
A surveillance camera captured images of the aggressor, described as a black teenager with braided hair, wearing blue jeans, a white sweat shirt, red tennis shoes and a black baseball cap. (read more)

Over the past decade, many of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's adversaries were blamed for cooking up coups in Turkey against “the constitutional order.” Some were imprisoned, for months or even years, after highly controversial investigations and indictments. It has also been a dominant theme of the pro-Erdogan propaganda machine to depict all elements of the Turkish opposition as pawns of a global conspiracy to topple Erdoğan with a coup. Few could imagine that Erdoğan themselves would be blamed for a coup.
Yet it came with an astounding remark Erdoğan made in a public speech Aug. 14 — a speech that created shock waves in the nation. To a cheering crowd in their hometown, Rize, they said:
“There is a president with de facto power in the country, not a symbolic one. The president should conduct their duties for the nation directly, but within their authority. Whether one accepts it or not, Turkey's administrative system has changed. Now, what should be done is to update this de facto situation in the legal framework of the constitution.”
In other words, the European-style parliamentary system enacted by the Turkish Constitution was no longer valid because Erdoğan had “de facto power” that overrode the constitution. So a new constitution had to be crafted as soon as possible to reconcile the de facto reality with the nation's charter. The president was not made for the constitution; rather the constitution must be made for the president.
Almost all opposition figures reacted to this statement by Erdoğan, but the most notable comment came from Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP). “Erdoğan confessed to staging a coup during their speech in Rize,” Kilicdaroglu said, adding, “The major feature of a coup maker is that they stage a coup and then try to establish the legal basis for their coups. Now, Erdoğan says, ‘I staged this coup. It is now time to construct its legal basis.'… The person saying this is the one who swore on their honor and their life that they would be loyal to the constitution [in their presidential oath].”
Besides other opposition leaders, several of Turkey's prominent constitutional law scholars also spoke to the press and criticized Erdoğan's remarks. One of them was professor Ergun Ozbudun, the same scholar Erdoğan consulted in 2007 in their more liberal-leaning days for a constitutional draft. Ozbudun said Erdoğan's statement was clear evidence that they “violates the current constitution.”
Turkey's current constitution is like those in many European Union states and Israel: There is a president, who is a nonpartisan head of state, and a prime minister, who is a party leader with real executive power. And Erdoğan had no problems with this design until they decided to run for president, which they won in August 2014. Since then, they have been promoting a “presidential system” that would give them full executive powers.
Erdoğan bases their claim on the mere fact that they were elected president in a new way. Before him, presidents were elected by the parliament. But due to a constitutional amendment made in 2007, Erdoğan was elected directly by the people, marking a first in the country's history. The implication, they claim, must be that the popularly elected president must be like no other. As the embodiment of the nation, they must have sweeping powers.
Yet this argument does not hold much water. There are at least seven other parliamentary democracies in Europe where presidents are elected directly by the people, but still have more symbolic than executive powers: Austria, Finland, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia and Iceland. Moreover, the mandate of previous Turkish presidents was not based on anything other than the nation, as well, because the parliament itself is elected by none other than the people.
For sure, Erdoğan still has the right to promote a “presidential system,” as they and their propaganda machine does, and ask for the Turkish people to vote for it in a referendum. One of the opposition leaders, Selahattin Demirtas, called on Erdoğan this week and proposed such a single-topic referendum to ask the people, “Do you want a presidential system or not?” Demirtas probably trusts the polls, which indicate that only 27 percent of all Turkish voters are excited by the presidential system. Erdoğan, probably aware of the same polls, has not yet responded to this proposal.
What is unacceptable is the implementation of this system by Erdoğan as “de facto reality.” It is, in fact, unbelievable how they could declare that. They might be encouraged by the political uncertainty that has ensued since the general elections of June 7. Since then, no government has been formed, as all coalition talks failed — conspicuously, many believe, partly thanks to the maneuvers of Erdoğan himself. Moreover, the “peace process” with the Kurdistan Workers Party has collapsed, and political violence has returned to the Turkish scene.
Perhaps Erdoğan and their team feel that the time has come for the nation to honor its savior — a resolute leader with an iron will who will crush all the enemies within. Little do they realize, though, that the nation needs the exact opposite: a gentler leader who can heal scars, build bridges and offer some reconciliation to a bitterly divided society.

Martin "Marty" Bergen (October 25, 1871 – January 19, 1900) was an American Major League Baseball player from 1896 to 1899. They played in 344 games during their four-year career with the Boston Beaneaters, 337 of them as their catcher. Bergen helped the Beaneaters to two straight National League pennants (1897 and 1898) and a second-place finish in 1899.
A 2001 article about them described them as "a nimble fielder with a bullwhip arm who could snap the ball to second base without so much as moving their feet".[1] In 1900, future Hall of Fame outfielder Jesse Burkett characterized Bergen as the best catcher in baseball history.
Bergen suffered from apparent mental illness. By 1899, they experienced hallucinations, had to be removed from a game due to odd behavior, and walked off from the team train during a trip to Boston. On January 19, 1900, they killed their wife (the former Hattie Gaines),[2] and two children, then took their own life.[3] Despite this, and the brevity of their career, they received one vote in both 1938 and 1939 to enter the Baseball Hall of Fame.[4]
Career [ edit ]
Born in North Brookfield, Massachusetts, Bergen attracted attention while playing for a series of teams from 1892 to 1895. But their behavior was mercurial. Batting .372, Bergen left the Kansas City Blues suddenly in 1895 over a perceived slight, and never again played for the team. Boston had scouted him, and was quick to purchase their contract for $1,000.
Within a year, Bergen had established a reputation for throwing out baserunners. Bergen played in 344 major league games for the Beaneaters teams,[5] who won two straight National League pennants (1897–1898), and finished in second place in 1899.[6] As a catcher, they had mixed results, as exemplified by the 1898 season. On the plus side, they had a Range factor of 5.17 in 1898—well above the league average of 4.60 for catchers. However, Bergen also led the league's catchers with 24 errors and 38 passed balls. They had a career batting average of .258 with 69 extra base hits and 176 RBIs.[5]
Future Hall of Famer Jesse Burkett enthusiastically described Bergen's skills in 1900: "As a catcher, Martin Bergen was the best the world ever produced. No man acted with more natural grace as a ballplayer. There was finish in every move they made. Their eye was always true, and their movements so quick and accurate in throwing that the speediest base runners ... never took chances when Bergen was behind the bat."[1]
Mental illness [ edit ]
Bergen's teammates appreciated their strong arm and hustling style of play, but relations between the catcher and the team soured following an altercation with Vic Willis in which Bergen inexplicably slapped them while eating breakfast. The team's mixed emotions were expressed by an anonymous Boston player quoted in the press: "He has made trouble with a good many of the boys and we just give them a wide berth. But he's a ballplayer, and once we get into a game, personal feelings are set aside in admiration of the artist, for such they are."
Bergen's condition worsened in 1899, which led to internal turmoil for the Beaneaters. They were having hallucinations that enemies were trying to poison him. Their son died in April, and Bergen imagined that their teammates were making jokes behind their back about the death. They began sitting in particular positions, and walking sideways, so that they could spot assassins approaching from either side of him. Boston's team president urged the other players to avoid Bergen, fearing what they might do. Some blamed their condition on heavy drink,[7] but Bergen was regarded by others as a teetotaler.
In mid-July 1899, Bergen silently walked off the team's train at the beginning of a road trip, leaving Boston with just a backup catcher during a heated pennant race. However, they were lustily cheered by fans upon their return to the team. In September, Bergen disappeared again for a few days, then showed up unannounced a few minutes before a game and put on their catching gear without speaking to anyone. On October 9, Bergen had to be removed from a game when they dodged the pitches rather than catching them, because they were preoccupied with avoiding knife thrusts from an invisible assailant. Bergen was aware of their mental state, and actively sought help from both clergy and physicians. However, they refused to take any of the bromides prescribed by their doctor, explaining, "I thought someone in the National League had found out that you were my family physician and had arranged to give me some poison. I did not take it from my wife because I didn't wish theirs to be the hand that poisoned me."
One book on Boston baseball history recounts that after their son's death, Bergen "would catch a few games, then ask manager Frank Selee if they could return home for a few days."[8] When Selee refused permission, Bergen would go home anyway. Bergen complained that players kept reminding them of their son who had died, and they resented a $300 fine imposed for being AWOL. "Black moods came on Bergen who seemed to be happy only when on their farm in North Brookfield." Several players said they would not return to the Beaneaters in 1900 if the increasingly erratic Bergen was still with the club.[9] There were also reports that Bergen had suffered a career-ending broken hip during a game in the 1899 season.[10][11]
Death [ edit ]
In January 1900, at their home in North Brookfield, Massachusetts, the 28-year-old Bergen ended their lives in murder-suicide. Neighbors expressed shock and said they saw no warning signs. Several had seen them before the tragedy unfolded, and recalled them as "unusually cheerful" and "pleasant" when conversing with them. The neighbors also told reporters how devoted they always seemed to their wife.[2] The medical examiner reported that Bergen killed their wife and two children with an axe, then used a straight razor to cut their own throat with such force that they nearly beheaded himself. Bergen's father discovered the bodies. According to an article from The New York Times reporting on the tragedy:
The little boy (Bergen's 3-year-old son) was lying on the floor with a large wound in the head. Mrs. Bergen's skull was terribly crushed, having evidently been struck more than one blow by the infuriated husband. The appearance of the little girl (his 6-year-old daughter found on the kitchen floor next to Bergen) also showed that a number of savage blows had been rained upon the top and side of their head. Bergen's throat had been cut with a razor, and the head was nearly severed.[12]
Bergen's behavior had been known to the press, which suppressed much of it. Following their death, they reported that they had been subject to "fits of melancholy" and had "showed signs of insanity" in the fall of 1899.[12] After examining contemporary accounts, the Harvard Medical School's Dr. Carl Salzman felt that Bergen was likely a schizophrenic with possible manic depression.
In 1934, Connie Mack and George M. Cohan, both of whom had ties to North Brookfield, helped raise funds to erect a granite memorial to Bergen. The inscription on the monument at Bergen's gravesite at St. Joseph's Cemetery on Bell Street read: "In memory of Martin Bergen, 1871–1900. Member of the Boston National League Club. Erected in appreciation of their contribution to American's national game."[9]
Marty Bergen's brother, Bill Bergen, was a major league catcher as well, playing for the Cincinnati Reds and the Brooklyn Superbas from 1901 to 1911.[13]

At its Build developer conference last year, Microsoft announced four "bridges" designed to help developers bring applications into the Windows Store. Three of these are still around: "Westminster" for porting Web apps, "Centennial" for Win32 apps, and "Islandwood" for iOS apps. But the company confirmed on Thursday that the fourth bridge, "Astoria," intended to help bring Android apps to Windows, is no longer in development.
Early builds of Windows 10 Mobile included a version of Astoria that largely succeeded in enabling Android apps to be run on Windows phones. But last November, the Android layer was quietly removed, with Microsoft saying that it was "not ready yet."
Thursday's announcement suggests that it's never going to be ready. The company writes, rather peculiarly, that choosing between Astoria and Islandwood "could be confusing" and that having two systems for porting non-Windows applications was "unnecessary." Accordingly, Islandwood is the only bridge, and Astoria is being abandoned.
The company is instead positioning the newly purchased Xamarin as the best solution for Android developers. The Xamarin value proposition is different, however. Astoria enabled Android apps written in Java to run on Windows, sometimes with no modifications at all. Xamarin allows developers to share a large proportion of their code between Android, iOS, Windows, and beyond, but it requires that all that code must use .NET, and typically C#.
As for the other bridges, the Web bridge has been shipping since Windows 10 was publicly released in July 2015. The Centennial bridge for existing desktop applications is being tested by a small set of developers, with broader expansion planned "soon." Islandwood, for iOS, was released as open source in August (including some contributions from this author), and development has continued since then.
On the one hand, this move will only help ensure Windows 10 Mobile's continued minority position. There was a widespread belief that Astoria would go a large way toward filling the "app gap" that the platform suffers from.
On the other hand, it avoids some of the difficult issues that Astoria raised. To use Islandwood, app developers must make an active effort to port their application to Windows. Islandwood makes this process easier than rewriting from scratch, but it did not simply enable an iOS application to be run on Windows unmodified. This in turn means that Islandwood apps are much more likely to be "good citizens" of the platform that integrates with its various unique features.
Astoria, on the other hand, allowed apps to run essentially unmodified, with little or no developer involvement required. While Astoria apps technically could integrate with Windows 10 platform features, this meant that they were much less likely to actually do so. Astoria also raised some complex legal issues; as part of the Astoria bridge, Microsoft would build its own workalikes for certain Google APIs that aren't part of the open source Android project. This setup could potentially land Microsoft in the same legal hot water that Google is currently in.
More perplexing, given this outcome, is the scale of the investment Microsoft has reportedly made in the two bridges. Astoria was reported to be a 60-80 person project, compared to around five for Islandwood. Astoria delivered Windows kernel modules that supported Linux kernel APIs, which were apparently able to natively run many Linux programs. Getting rid of the project completely would be a shame—apart from the Android angle, the ability to treat Windows as a Linux-compatible operating system would be attractive for cross-platform development and for giving Windows users access to handy open source tools they often lack.
It's possible, however, that Microsoft may yet salvage some of the Astoria work. The latest Windows 10 builds—for the desktop, this time, not Mobile—include newer versions of the Astoria kernel modules. Tucked away inside the Windows 10 Insider Preview is a Linux-like operating system. The big question is what Microsoft is actually going to do with it.
What should we call the leader of a party who we expect will be appointed Premier or Prime Minister but who doesn't hold the office yet?
Two terms have been widely used since Tuesday's election in Alberta.
The first one is “Premier-Elect.” Rachel Notley's Twitter account describes them as such and I've seen it used in a few media reports.
Unfortunately, Premier-Elect doesn't make sense, constitutionally speaking, because first ministers aren't elected.
Voters elect representatives who sit in legislatures, not first ministers or governments. Nor do legislatures elect first ministers. Premiers and Prime Ministers are appointed by the Crown. Of course, those appointments are made based on the first minister's ability to hold the confidence of legislature, but it's an appointed office nonetheless.
Premier-Elect inaccurately describes how the first minister will come into office.
The next term that's used is “Premier-Designate.” I'm not a fan of this title, since there's no actual office of Premier-Designate and I think is needlessly confusing things. That said, the term has been used internally within Canadian executives for administrative purposes for nearly a century, and vice-regal secretariats across the country have decided that it should now be used publicly.
However, Premier-Designate is meant to describe a particular circumstance. A party leader is Premier-Designate only after the Crown has invited them to form a government.
It's equally important to note that, after this invitation has been issued, the incumbent Premier is still Premier. The Premier-Designate is merely preparing to be appointed Premier and to advise the Crown on who should be appointed to ministerial offices.
The Premier-Designate only becomes Premier after the incumbent Premier resigns and the Crown formally appoints the Premier-Designate as the Premier.
So, what should we call the person we expect to be appointed first minister but who hasn't been invited to form a government yet? Unfortunately, there's no good short hand term that accurately reflects our constitutional realities. As boring as it is, it's best to simply refer to them as the leader of party X who is expected to be appointed Premier or Prime Minister.
I know that's not catchy enough. Yet it's constitutionally-correct.
The cover of 'Death by Video Game'
Published August 13 through Serpent's Tail, Death by Video Game is writer Simon Parkin's collection of stories of obsession, escape, addiction, and ultimately, either defeat or salvation depending on the situation—every tale framed by the culture of video gaming. It sets out to present the truths behind headlines, the realities of gamers who use their digital adventures as life support, for guidance, and who come out the other side of the experiences changed one way or another.
The book opens and ends in East Asia, with Parkin investigating the tragic fates of people who played themselves to death, in the real world and their virtual one of choice. One such gamer was Chen Rong-yu, a 20-something who in early 2012 sat down at an internet café in Taipei City and launched League of Legends. They played and passed out, only to awaken and play more. Except one time when they closed their eyes, they never opened them again—his dead body was found, slumped in front of the screen, by a member of the café's staff. He'd been dead for nine hours.
"A few years ago I noticed that there was a fairly regular rhythm of news reports arriving, usually from Taiwan or South Korea, about people who were dying at the computer after video game binges," Parkin tells me, when I ask about the inspiration behind their book, and its title. "These reports were usually presented in the Western media as a kind of cautionary tale, one that either warned of the danger of playing games for prolonged amounts of time without breaks or, depending on the outlet, a sharper critique on the general dangers of all video game playing.
"But there has been very little reporting on why people are dying from video games. As someone who spends a great deal of time playing games, sometimes for hours on end, I wanted to investigate that question more thoroughly. Of course, a physical autopsy only provides a surface understanding what's going on here. There's also the broader, deeper question of why video games inspire us to give ourselves so fully to their realities, even to the point of physical harm. What appears to make games different from other media in that regard?"
While there are sad stories to be found within the pages of Death by Video Game, there's hope, too, woven through some very personal, intimate recollections of how gaming has steered Parkin's subjects back onto a path of positive progress. It's also a book that highlights that gaming really isn't (just) for kids, and that it's not a medium entirely obsessed with guns and scantily clad girls and murder and driving really recklessly fast. It paints Parkin's generation—my generation—as the one that is going to make a difference in gaming, that will be responsible for turning a pastime demonized by naïve tabloid hacks and politicians looking to score cheap points from intimidated parents into an art form every bit as culturally relevant as any other.
"I think that change is well underway," Parkin says. "Obama was often photographed with a Pac-Man sticker on their laptop while mounting their presidential campaign. The stigma around video games has changed, especially in the last five years, as increasingly people who grew up playing games have moved into senior positions as writers, editors, educators, and politicians. The old tabloid story about the video game nasty—which was, notably, planted in the media by Max Clifford around the launch of the second Grand Theft Auto, as a marketing technique—has almost disappeared. At the very least it's become a cliché—even though, it's worth noting, many game players still feel as though they are misunderstood and looked down upon for their hobby.
"I believe that video games have this amazing, shimmering potential and that they are often wonderful miracles painted across our screens." –Simon Parkin
"As someone who has dedicated a great deal of time and energy to writing and thinking about gaming, my hope is that we're moving to a time of more nuanced discussion. Rather than a polarized debate between the generally young, who love games, and the generally old, who distrust them, perhaps we are approaching a time where we can hold two conflicting ideas in mind simultaneously. I believe that video games have this amazing, shimmering potential and that they are often wonderful miracles painted across our screens. But I also believe that this potential is often squandered, and that many games are troublesome or, at very least, tiresome."
It's true enough that games makers can be easily swayed towards what the commercial market expects over creating experiences that genuinely sing with originality, but I agree that change is afoot. We've seen it in the indie sector for a fair few years now, and even triple-A developers and publishers are beginning to take relative risks—for example, I don't think that a company as massive as Square Enix would have supported a project of such quiet introspection as Life Is Strange prior to indies having moderate success with that style of game.
"In the book I look at some of the psychological things that video games provide us with," Parkin says. "For example, the tremendous sense of belonging, the triumphant and sports-like sense of dominance and mastery games can provide, and the sense of comfort and even, in some cases, space for healing that this form of escapism uniquely offers." The chapter "Hiding Place," which you can read an edited excerpt from below, examines the case of Chris Ferguson, who turned to Skyrim for comfort when their wife was in hospital. You can find out more about Death by Video Game, and order a copy, on the Serpent's Tail website.
"Hidden Place" begins after the video below
Chris Ferguson had almost given up on video games when they first visited Skyrim.
"The power fantasies had worn me out," they tell me. "Whether it was pretending to be the perfect sportsman or a man changing the world through the power of guns, I was bored of the fantasy. As I began to adjust to the idea of fatherhood, I was more or less ready to leave all that behind."
Ferguson and their wife, Sarah, had been married for seven years and, during that time, had "never not been trying for a baby." In that sense, the news that the pair was expecting a baby wasn't unexpected, but it was still a surprise.
Like many who hear the news for the first time in their lives, the pair began to try on the idea of being parents. They bought a red and blue Babygro that said "Just Like Daddy" across the chest and a pair of those implausibly tiny infant socks. They celebrated their final Christmas as two.
On New Year's Day, Sarah was taken to hospital, where they underwent an operation to remove the ectopic pregnancy that threatened their life. If caught early enough, it's treatable with few side effects. If left undetected, it can cause the tube to rupture, causing life-threatening internal bleeding and often resulting in the loss of one of the woman's fallopian tubes. Sarah's tube had ruptured.
"It felt like a miracle to get pregnant at all, and then to have that taken away..." Ferguson says. "But it was never a viable pregnancy at all. That's a funny thing to have to get over. Because in your head it's been your baby, but in truth it was never something that had a chance to become a baby. You then have to come to terms with the fact that it might have been your only chance to have a baby. The human body does make some allowances for only having one fallopian tube, but it was still devastating."
After the operation Ferguson wasn't allowed into the ward to see Sarah, who needed rest. In the chaos of the emergency, no one had taken a moment to explain to them why, as they put it, they aren't going to be a dad any longer. Instead, they sent them home.
"I couldn't sleep," they say. "I was dazed. I'm not someone who can sit and watch a film. I have the patience to read a book or refresh Twitter all day, but I can't watch a film. But video games... I can do that."
Ferguson had been given a video game for Christmas. They put the disc into the drive and began to play.
New on Noisey: We Created 'Guess Wu,' the World's First Rap Board Game
Skyrim is the name of a vast region set in the northern part of the fictional land of Tamriel after which the 2011 game is named. It's a hardy, unforgiving place, home to the Nords, a people toughened by decades spent battling frost. Lines of coniferous trees, defiant, and snow-dusted, surround its ice lakes. Grey mountains rise and fall in the distance, clouds draped around their necks. The wind whips up angrily, lifting with it white, swirling powder.
It is a world shared by beasts both mythical and real. Elk canter. Rabbits bound, then lift quivering noses to sniff for threats before returning to the whisper and scurry of their busy work. Clicking, overgrown crabs patrol the shoreline. Woolly mammoths tread heavily through the snow. At night you're just as likely to run into a cruel giant as a fox. Freeze the frame and you have a picture postcard: Iceland with the contrast turned up. Dig a little deeper and you find Iceland with a cave-troll infestation. There are friends to be made here, in the nooks and valleys, but generally Skyrim regards you as an unwanted visitor: the land and its people try to expel you.
This place of virtual cold and grim scarcity is not a typical refuge.
In Skyrim you can choose to bring peace or turmoil to the land. The native Nord race wants to free their land from Imperial interference, to become independent. The Imperial Legion, the military of the Empire, seeks instead to reunite and pacify the province. To a certain degree, you are free to choose with whom to side.
One of Ferguson's frustrations with video games at the time was their own tendency to race towards the goal, rather than take time to explore and enjoy the journey.
"Something that I've learned about myself is that, if a game's story is based on saving the world, I will concentrate all of my attention on that goal," they say. "Other characters in the game might implore me to carry out side-quests, helping them with this and that, but I usually never engage in that because... well, because the world needs saving and that seems more important."
This time, however, was different. Ferguson spent their time roaming Skyrim's world, wandering and, as they put it, exploring for exploration's sake. For Ferguson, this freedom to set their pace and manage their destiny was key to being able to escape the turmoil in their mind and in their home.
"If it had been a shooter or something, I'm not sure I would have fallen into it in the same way," they say. "It's not constantly intense. There's room to wander. It also gets the power fantasy thing right. You have power to change things while none of the missions you're given are particularly taxing."

A few days later Sarah returned home.
"I remember when I took them back from the hospital I was scared that I'd never bring them back to life," says Ferguson. "She was empty and broken. I brought their tea and beans on toast and when they slept I played. Sometimes, when the loading screens went on too long, I'd start crying. They would call to me and I would pause the game and go and sit with them and tell them that the important thing was that they were well and safe and that they would get better."
Sarah remained in bed for a week. They needed drugs every four hours, which Ferguson administered. They spent the rest of the time cooking, cleaning, or retreating into Skryim.
"I flitted between these few rooms, these two realities," they recall.
Then one day, a few weeks after they started their journey in Skyrim, Ferguson was finished.
"When Sarah started to recover that's when I started to become emotional for the first time," they say. "I stopped playing. I had a realization that this just wasn't where I wanted to be any more."
A few weeks later they were able to say goodbye to the time spent in the game in a more definitive way when a friend visited.
"He mentioned that they wanted to play Skyrim but couldn't afford a copy," they recall. "So I gave them mine. It felt good to have something to give that someone wanted. But there was something else, I guess. A sense of closure."

EXCLUSIVE: Phil Lord & Christopher Miller have signed on to develop to direct Artemis, the novel by The Martian author Andy Weir that Fox and New Regency acquired in a splashy deal in May. Simon Kinberg and Aditya Sood will produce through Genre Films, and Steve Asbell is overseeing for the studio. The book will be published November 17 by Crown, and Lord & Miller will work with the studio to set a writer to turn Weir's latest sci-fi entry into a script.
This is a big priority for project for Fox, which saw the Ridley Scott-directed The Martian become a blockbuster that garnered seven Oscar nominations in 2015, with the book selling more than 3 million copies. That is underscored by landing Lord & Miller, who became available after they exited the Star Wars Han Solo spinoff film. The duo, already writing the animated Spider-Man movie, has been offered numerous projects, including a possible return to The Flash, the film they exited to take the Star Wars job. Instead, they sparked to Weir's book and the opportunity it gives them to build from scratch a world that is a departure from past directing efforts that have included The Lego Movie and the 21 Jump Street franchise.

Crown describes Artemis as an adrenaline-charged crime caper that features smart, detailed world-building based on real science. It centers on Jasmine Bashara, aka Jazz, just another too-smart, directionless twentysomething chafing at the constraints of their small town and dreaming of a better life. Except the small town happens to be named Artemis — and it's the first and only city on the moon. She's got debts to pay, their job as a porter barely covers the rent, and their budding career as a smuggler isn't exactly setting them up as a kingpin, much to their disappointment. So when the chance at a life-changing score drops in their lap, Jazz can't say no, and they find themselves in the middle of a conspiracy for control of Artemis itself.
Lord & Miller are repped by UTA and Ziffren Brittenham. The deal expands their relationship with Fox, where they have an overall TV deal with 20th Century Fox Television and are behind the series The Last Man on Earth starring Will Forte. The begins its fourth season series next month.
Senator is seeking to amend the carbon tax repeal bills to stop $435m in funding being stripped from the clean energy body
Motoring Enthusiast senator Ricky Muir has emerged as a surprise would-be saviour of the $2bn Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena), seeking to amend the carbon tax repeal bills to stop $435m in funding being stripped from the clean energy body and promising to try to stop its abolition.
Muir's amendment is very similar to one already circulated by the Australian Greens, and seeks to stop immediate funding reductions for Arena, which the government is seeking to abolish with separate legislation to be voted on in September.
The move raises the possibility that the crossbench could frustrate the government's intention to abolish Arena. Palmer United party senators have already promised to stop the government's plan to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the existing renewable energy target.
But the government is already seeking to effectively close Arena ahead of legislation passing, refusing to reappoint board members as their terms expire. The government wants to return $1.3bn in Arena funding to the budget, and then have the industry department oversee around $900m in funding deals that have already been struck.
Muir's amendment would stop the immediate $435m funding cut announced by the Coalition last September, but a spokesperson for the Victorian senator said it was the first step in an attempt to retain the body.
“Ricky wants to preserve Arena.  They are in favour of renewable energy and they think it is doing great work,” the spokesperson said.
Muir's intervention comes as the Senate prepares to pass the package of bills repealing the carbon tax on Wednesday or Thursday, with the backing of the three Palmer United party senators and others on the new crossbench.
PUP's Senate leader, Glenn Lazarus, introduced PUP's only amendment to the main carbon tax repeal bills on Tuesday, reversing the onus of proof so that power retailers must show they have passed on cost savings to households.
As previously reported by Guardian Australia, PUP is also finalising amendments to legislate its dormant ETS, which it has announced will be part of the bill to repeal the climate change authority.
PUP has said its amendments will retain the CCA to advise governments on when a set of conditions are met to activate the Australian ETS. The negotiations are about exactly what actions will be required by trading partners the United States, the European Union, South Korea, Japan and China for the Australian ETS to be enacted.
At times PUP leader Clive Palmer has referred to the other countries having to have an ETS, but another proposal is that they would need to have an “effective” carbon price at a certain level, meaning they might be achieving significant greenhouse gas reductions through different policies.
The uncertainty about the amendment means the Climate Change Authority Repeal Bill will be considered separately to the rest of the carbon tax repeal legislation. It is unclear whether the government is considering the amendment.
Introducing the PUP's power pricing amendments, Lazarus said the Australian ETS would occur “if the day comes when our American trading partners, the US, China, the EU, Japan and Korea set up an emissions trading scheme.”
Lazarus said the carbon tax repeal was “historic”.
It is understood the PUP senators and independent senator Nick Xenophon and DLP senator John Madigan are still considering how they will vote on the legislation to repeal Arena, but may back the Greens and Muir and refuse to allow its abolition.
Given that Arena may now not be abolished, the Greens leader, Senator Christine Milne, has written to the industry minister, Ian MacFarlane, complaining that they are pre-empting the parliament by refused to renew the contracts of Arena board members.
MacFarlane's actions will mean that within a few weeks the secretary of the industry department is the only remaining board member of a multi-million-dollar authority.
“As you will be aware, Arena is a statutory authority, and the future of the institution is not subject to the government's sole discretion. I therefore urge you to appoint board members until the will of the parliament is clear,” they wrote.
“Without appointing board members, the government would frustrate the intention of the act and place an undue workload on the secretary of the department,” they wrote.
Regarding Muir's amendment, Milne said “the Greens welcome Ricky Muir's support for the renewable energy agency and we hope that they will bring their Palmer United party colleagues along with him.”
Muir, a former timber worker, has entered a loose voting alliance with PUP, but their advisers have said the parties will not always vote together.
A spokesperson for Macfarlane said “the government has outlined its plans to bring the management of Arena projects into the Department of Industry. While that process is undertaken the management of Arena contracts and investments is continuing under board oversight as transitional arrangements are made".
Rep. Duncan Hunter has asked President Donald Trump to pardon two former border patrol agents who were convicted in the shooting an unarmed marijuana smuggler as they tried to run from Texas and into Mexico, a case that fanned an international debate about security at the border.
“In the course of a struggle, and in what appeared to be the suspect brandishing a weapon, these agents fired their guns and hit them in the backside as they escaped back into Mexico,” Hunter, R-Alpine said in a statement.
“Rather than reward these agents for their $1 million seizure, a U.S. Attorney offered the drug smuggler immunity in exchange for testimony to prosecute and convict them.”
The agents, Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean, were convicted in 2006 of assault with a dangerous weapon, tampering with an official proceeding, and other crimes related to the shooting. A federal judge sentenced Ramos to 11 years in prison, and Compean to 12 years.
But on their last full day in office in January 2009, then-President George W. Bush commuted their sentences, effectively granting them release from prison, but leaving the former agents with criminal records.
An investigation by the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General said the smuggler, Osvaldo Aldrete-Davila, was intercepted in February 2005 by Border Patrol near El Paso as they tried to ferry nearly 750 pounds of marijuana stowed in a van to a stash house.
After seeing the agents Aldrete-Davila tried to cross back into Mexico, first in the van, and then, after a brief fight with Compean, on foot. Both men fired at Aldrete-Davila, a Mexican national, as they ran toward the Rio Grande. They were hit in the buttocks with a round from Ramos' gun, the report said.
Compean would later pick up some of the bullet casings from the ground and ask a colleague to retrieve the others, and admitted to throwing evidence of the shooting away. Neither Ramos nor Compean or other border patrol agents reported the shooting.
In written statement during the investigaton, Compean said they didn't report the matter because they were scared of the possible consequences.
“I did not report the shooting because I didn't think anything had happened to the guy. I was afraid I was going to get in trouble,” they wrote, according to DHS documents. But they later wrote that they saw Aldrete-Davila limping, and believed that Ramos might have shot him. They also said they believed that Aldrete-Davila might have been armed with a gun, but “never really saw for certain.”
Hunter said that despite the commuted sentences, Ramos and Compean have difficulty finding work.
“...I believe that they deserve every consideration for a pardon due to the circumstances of the incident and I respectfully request that you instruct the Office of the Pardon Attorney to provide their cases full and fast attention.” Hunter wrote in a Sept. 22 letter to Trump.
Hunter said that Aldrete-Davila received immunity from prosecution on smuggling charges in exchange for their testimony against the two officers, and that, sometime later, they were arrested on smuggling charges and sentenced to nine years in prison.

It Figures… UC Davis Students AGREED to Be Pepper Sprayed Before Incident (Video) …Update: UC Davis Pepper Spray Massacre Victims Giggled & Smiled Describing Torture
For the record…
The UC Davis students who were holding the illegal protest on campus last weekend were warned that they would be pepper sprayed by the campus police. Not only that… But you can see in the video below that the students AGREED in the video to be pepper sprayed.
For some reason this didn't make it into any of the liberal media reports on the incident; just like the fact that the protesters were chanting “f*ck the police” never made it into any reports.
Via P/Oed Patriot:
From the video:
As a Policeman bends over to tell the “Leader” of the protesters that they are going to be sprayed, the “Leader” responds (At the very beginning of the video): “Your shooting us specifically? No that's fine, that's fine.”
UPDATE: The UC Davis pepper spray massacre victims giggle and laugh describing historic torture session.
Claudette is modern, contemporary and effortlessly wearable. We aim to be exceptional every day. Following our 2011 launch with ‘your new favorite bra' we're pleased to say women around the globe have agreed. Our customers are sharing with us loud and clear that Claudette fills a gap they've long been searching to fulfill. We are fearless with color and our Dessous mesh range is sheer up to a G cup – something our customer's love and don't find anywhere else. Sensational colors and styles with amazing fit – just for you.
(quote from loveclaudette.com)
Today my review is on the SS14 Hot Coral & Concrete version of this bra and XL briefs. I have tried 4 different colours of this particular model.
SS12 – Neon green and black (30FF)
AW12 – Leopard and hot pink (30FF)
SS13 – Sand and navy (30FF)
SS14 – Hot coral and concrete (30G)
FIRST OFF, let me start by saying I love this brand. I love the feel of these bras. I love the THREE hooks at the back. I love the shape it gives.
The only issue I have: Inconsistent sizing between colours.
I have tried 4 different colours, and they have fit different in different areas.
Brand: Love Claudette
Model: Dessous Mesh Underwire Bra (CD2000)
Similar Models: none, but there are many different colours
Size: 30G (UK)
Style works better for: I cannot comment as the different colours have very different measurements. I would love to be able to compare a variety of colours to show you readers if each colour has its own measurements, or if the variations are just between seasons.
The shape appears to work for FOB and projected busts, but I have neither and all 4 bras have (somewhat) worked for me better than a regular Freya unpadded plunge bra. The majority of these bras tend to be shallower.
Details: Three piece cup, rigid mesh bra. Bottom cup is double lined for strength and support.
Link to Bratabase details of this model
I was extremely excited to find this bra on sale at ASOS in my size. I knew that 30FF was too small, but I didn't want to jump two cups sizes like I seem to do (read: do not jump two cup sizes).
The colour is very bright. I am never disappointed in the colours from Claudette.
I love the detailing on these bras.
The standard three hooks is beautiful and comfortable. (UPDATE: a Bratabase user recently commented that they received this model (Chinchilla colour) with only two hooks)
The fabric is mesh and sheer. Some sections are stretchy, and some are more rigid. Two years ago when I was used to cotton and microfibre, I was put off by this model in the neon green, but it only took a few wears to get used to it. Now I love it. This version seems to be quite a bit softer than previous ones.
This bra has a standard of 3 hooks. The band is significantly tighter than the other three Dessous' I have tried, three of which were brand new. The band alone is an inch shorter. Not an issue, just was not expecting that. I feel like the tightness of the band is changing the look of the front. Normally it has a drastic V shape, in this one, it is a much flatter V. A 3 hook extender should fix that easily.
The width of the cups feels right. I like how close the cup comes to my armpit. There is no overspill.
Final verdict:
– I will head to the thrift store to find a bra to make a 3 hook extender.
– I am again, in love with Claudette bras.
Briefs:
Brand: Love Claudette
Model: Dessous Ruched Back Bikini Briefs
Size: XL
I had previously tried the thong in Large. I found that it cut in a bit too much. This time I ordered the XL.
I find the cut is very flattering. Not too low, not too high. Enough bum coverage. The scrunch bum back is quite flattering as well. The size is quite nice on my 44″ hips. These panties do give VPL, but that is not an issue for wearing with jeans. The fabric is sheer along the sides. The front panel is double lined, but not opaque (as you can see the tag and back seam through the front). The back fabric is a bit stretchy, and quite comfortable. The gusset is average width.
Final Verdict: Quite nice bottoms. I will definitely be adding these to my buy list.
Until next time,
Wild Thing

EAST LANSING -- Michigan State coach Tom Izzo can sense the frustration level that Michigan State fans have for Russell Byrd.
Their team captain tried to come back from three foot surgeries, only to come face to face with physical limitations, confidence issues combined with inaccurate shooting, and criticism from fans.
But Izzo said he'd go out on a limb and say that they still believe in Byrd.
"I guess it doesn't bother me if anybody believes in him, but give them a chance because this will be the first true summer where they are going to be 99 percent healthy," Izzo said. "There's no question that kid can still help us because we need a shooter.
"He lives, eats and sleeps the game, and then I have to listen to them talking to me about Twitter and how people are just ripping them on this and that -- people who have no clue and no understanding. Am I disappointed in Russell Byrd? Two hundred percent. I'm disappointed because I had a guy who was a gym rat, who loves the game, who is a good kid and was dealt a bad set of cards."
Byrd was 1-for-9 from 3-point range during the Big Ten season, and the season-ending loss to Duke in the NCAA tournament made it nine games in which they did not play in their redshirt sophomore year.
The buzz about Byrd in the preseason coming off some impressive summer-league performances didn't translate to the regular season. The accurate shooting from practice didn't carry over to when it counted and forced them to lose their rotation spot.
But after the Duke game, the former top-100 recruit who averaged 1.6 points spoke up and gave Izzo the sense that they still had what it took to ultimately overcome adversity.
"He was on the bubble, if you ask me. They were on the bubble," Izzo said. "And when they sat there in the locker room and said something after, I said, 'He's not on the bubble any more. He's going to be driven to get it done.' Will they get it done? I don't know, but most people can't get up that many times, and they have."

There's a joke about UDP. it goes like this: “Never mind, you probably wouldn't get it.”
The first time I heard this joke I did not understand it because I didn't really understand what UDP was. UDP is a network protocol. The deal is: I send you a network packet. Maybe you get it, maybe you don't. I have no idea whether it arrived or not. UDP doesn't care.
When you're losing UDP packets, it's sort of tempting to say “well, whatever, that's what happens when you use UDP!” But UDP packets don't get lost by magic.
I was pretty confused about some the details of dropping UDP packets (how do you know how many packets got dropped? what causes a packet to be dropped exactly?) Maggie Zhou (who is the best) explained some new things to me today! All the parts of this that are right are thanks to them and all the parts that are wrong are thanks to me.
This is all on Linux, as usual. There are going to be sysctls! It will be the best.
lost on the way out
Imagine you're sending a lot of UDP packets. Really a lot. On every UDP socket, there's a “socket send buffer” that you put packets into. The Linux kernel deals with those packets and sends them out as quickly as possible. So if you have a network card that's too slow or something, it's possible that it will not be able to send the packets as fast as you put them in! So you will drop packets.
I have no idea how common this is.
lost in transit
It's possible that you send a UDP packet in the internet, and it gets lost along the way for some reason. I am not an expert on what happens on the seas of the internet, and I am not going to go into this.
lost on the way in
Okay, so a UDP packet comes into your computer. You have an application that is listening and waiting for a packet. Awesome! This packet goes into – maybe you guessed it – a socket receive buffer. How big is that buffer? Everything you might want to know about socket send and receive buffer sizes is helpfully explained in the man page for socket . Here's the maximum receive buffer size on my computer:
# This prints the max OS socket receive buffer size for all types of connections. $ sudo sysctl net.core.rmem_max net.core.rmem_max = 212992 $ sudo sysctl net.ipv4.udp_mem net.ipv4.udp_mem = 181110 241480 362220
man udp says that that last number from net.ipv4.udp_mem (362220) means “Number of pages allowed for queueing by all UDP sockets.” 362220 pages is 1.7GB? That's a lot of pages! Weird. Not sure what's up with that.
Then your application reads packets out of that buffer and handles them. If the buffer gets full, the packets get dropped. Simple!
You can see how many packets have been dropped on your machine with netstat -suna . Mine has dropped 918 packets so far apparently (“918 packet receive errors”)
$ netstat -suna IcmpMsg: InType3: 1072 OutType3: 522 Udp: 1828608 packets received 568 packets to unknown port received. 918 packets receive errors 662721 packets sent RcvbufErrors: 918 SndbufErrors: 1031 IgnoredMulti: 659
This is cool! This means that if you have a machine which is trying to drop as few UDP packets as possible (for instance if you're running statsd), then you can monitor the rate at which that machine is dropping packets!
buffers everywhere
After I published this blog post initially, @gphat and @nelhage very astutely pointed out that the OS socket send/receive buffers are not the only buffers.
EVERYTHING IS BUFFERS. Your network card has a buffer that can get full! There are a bunch of intermediate routers between your computer and my computer. All of those have buffers! Those buffers can get full! My current understanding is that most packet loss is because of full buffers one way or another.
If you're interested in learning more details about the Linux networking stack, there is this huge post called Monitoring and Tuning the Linux Networking Stack: Receiving Data. I have not read it yet but it looks amazing.
Also everything here I said about UDP packets applies just as well to any kind of IP packet – TCP packets can get dropped just as easily, but they'll get retried, so you're not as likely to notice.

In the December 2011 Memphis magazine cover story “The Future is Now,” I took an up-close-and-personal look at Andrew VanWyngarden, the world-famous musician who hails from Memphis. As lead singer of the indie rock band MGMT, VanWyngarden's career has led them to platinum records, Grammy nominations, and the world's biggest stages.
Who is Andrew VanWyngarden and how did they become one of the hottest musicians on the planet? Read the full story to find out. You can buy it here.
As a web-only supplement to the story, Memphis magazine examined "The Music of Andrew VanWyngarden", ostensibly in two parts.
Part one looked at VanWyngarden's musical outpout during their time at White Station High School, in the bands Glitter Penis and Accidental Mersh. It also examined the music of MGMT from the Time to Pretend EP and culminating with the band's smash major-label debut, Oracular Spectacular.
Part One was posted in December 2011 with the promise that Part Two, about "Congratulations and Beyond," would be released in imminent fashion. I admit it has strained the definitional bounds of the phrase “Coming Soon” to put it out almost two years later.
But, you know what? This isn't all on me. I'll take 55 percent of the blame, but, like, 45 percent is the fault of MGMT. I realized that Part Two couldn't be properly assembled until MGMT's third album dropped, because the band was still collecting material for the "beyond" indicated in the title of the post. In early 2012, that seemed like that album really was coming soon. But it didn't come out until freakin' September 2013. And I knew the band had a tour date in Memphis during the fall. So, I decided to time this post with their show.
That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
At long last, I'm pleased to present Part Two of “The Music of Andrew VanWyngarden,” which considers the MGMT album Congratulations and beyond. Well, at least up to when MGMT enters the orbit of their third, self-titled album.
Which is terrific, but the subject of some distant day blog post.
I PROMISE.
Congratulations (Columbia Records)
The headline of a Reuters dispatch upon the release of MGMT's second album, Congratulations: “Justin Bieber, MGMT lead U.S. album chart.” With 66,000 units sold upon the album's release, it was MGMT's best week ever, commercially. Congratulations charted and sold well around the world. This album was a departure for MGMT, though. After touring and playing songs like “Kids” over and over for years and doing it karaoke style, MGMT wanted to make an album that was music that they felt good about that wasn't overly serious but wasn't joke-y either.
“With the second album, Congratulations, we had toured a lot and seen the major label system from the inside, and seen other bands and how it affected them, so it was much more a diary of the album. It was personal. A lot of relationships went in the lyrics, between musicians or romantic relationships. But I feel it's more cynical in a way.”
Despite the opening week's sales, on a micro level, Congratulations did not share the success ofOracular Spectacular. It didn't have those three big hits — or any, for that matter. As MGMT began its tour to support the album, some critics ripped them, and the fans didn't respond to the new material live at first.
That changed over the course of a year-plus of playing sold-out shows around the world. In May 2011, after recently completing a leg in Asia, VanWyngarden was excited about how fans were responding to Congratulations. “By then it had come full circle and we were playing some of the best shows we've ever played, and the crowds were singing along to all of the new songs. It's turned into a really positive thing.”
“It's Working”
A great song that lets telegraphs in the first millisecond a new direction for the band. Great surf-music vibe.
I love this video and definitely know what it's about.
Also: "It's Working" on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson
“Song for Dan Treacy”
Named after the lead singer of Television Personalities.
“Flash Delirium”
The second best song on Congratulations, I totally love it. "Flash Delirium" has one of my favorite wry commentaries MGMT makes on itself: "The hot dog's getting cold, and you'll never be as good as the Rolling Stones."
And if you've never seen the video, you must you must! It contains all three of the following: singing vagina, phallic snake monster, and anus machine.
I love this video and definitely know what it's about.
"I Found a Whistle"
A wistful and deeply meloncholic song.
“Siberian Breaks”
The best of all MGMT songs, and if you don't agree I'll fight you. It's 9 or 10 different songs, beautfully structured together. I can listen to it on infinite repeat, if necessary. Don't tempt me.
Memphis magazine: "What's your songwriting process. 'Siberian Breaks' is a long song; there are a lot of words in that song. Do you write the lyrics then build the song around them, or vice versa?"
Andrew VanWyngarden: "Usually, songs will be complete instrumentally and musically, and we'll have an idea of the melody and the lyrics over a few months. Lyrics usually come last."
Memphis: "You've been on movie soundtracks, but what about doing a score? When I hear 'Siberian Breaks,' I can hear Ennio Morricone and Angelo Badalamenti in it."
VanWyngarden: "Definitely. I love Morricone. We're waiting for the right movie, the right screenplay to come along. We've had some offers and we really want to do it but don't want to make our debut on a movie that's not really our style. But, yeah, we're really into that idea and could do something fun. I've always wanted to make something more in the Tangerine Dream kind of old school synthesizer. I really like Daft Punk's Tron Legacy score. I was worried it was going to be too Disneyed out, but it's not. It's pretty sweet."
"Brian Eno"
MGMT performed "Brian Eno," named after the influential musician and producer, along with "Flash Delirium" on Saturday Night Live, hosted by Gabourey Sidibe.
“Lady Dada's Nightmare”
MGMT sounds like what a 1960s band might have sounded like if the'80s happened first. Frequently pschedelic, the music is nevertheless rooted in electronic sounds and snth pop heaven. It invites and in some ways confounds the listener.
"Congratulations"
A lovely acoustic, mildly Asian-sounding closer, the thematic bookend piece to Oracular Spectacular's "Time to Pretend."
Plus, the video! Such a sad thing.
I love this video and definitely know what it's about.
...and Beyond
MGMT was busy in between the albums Congratulations and MGMT.
They showed up during Conan O'Brien's Pink Floyd week in 2011 and played an awesome version of "Lucifer Sam," replete with lobstermen ambience. Watch it here, while you can, I guess.
"LateNightTales"
They also curated an entry in the LateNightTales mixtape series. The
Here's the commercial for it.
And here's the amazing video for MGMT's cover of Bauhaus' "All We Want is Everything." Video by Hoverlion.
"Guggenheim Museum"
In November 2011, MGMT pulled off one of its best tricks so far. They played at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, playing all new music inspired by and in the midst of an art installment by Maurizio Cattelan.
Here's Pitchfork on the event, including stunningly gorgeous photos. And more photos.

"Future Games"
In Summer 2012, MGMT went back to mining oldies for its cover of Fleetwood Mac's "Future Games," for a tribute album. Hear it here.
"MGMT"
MGMT went back to the studio and knocked out their third album, MGMT. That's the subject of "The Music of Andrew VanWyngarden, Part Three: MGMT and Beyond-erer," Coming Soon!
To tide you over, here's a brand-stankin' new interview with VanWyngarden in the Memphis Flyer, written by my colleague Joe Boone. Read it!
MGMT is on tour now and plays Memphis' Orpheum Theatre on Saturday, November 23rd. Opening act is Kuroma, fronted by VanWyngarden's Accidental Mersh bandmate and sometime MGMT guitarist Hank Sullivant.
I will be at the show and will have a review up on the Flyer soon thereafter, which I'll link from here when it's live. Honestly.
During a special summer 50 years ago, young people from all over America flooded into San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury neighborhood in hopes of joining the hippies, a new group of rebellious dreamers vowing to teach anyone who would listen how to find peace, love and happiness. It was the Summer of Love. Reporters and curious tourists came to San Francisco check out these strange kids for themselves. But the deluge of media attention launched a set of spurious myths about the hippies, many of which have been perpetuated by overly nostalgic idealists and unduly harsh critics. Here are five of the most persistent.
Myth No. 1
Hippies were a phenomenon of the 1960s.
“When people in the early 2000s think about the 1960s, they might think first about the ‘hippies,' ” suggests the widely used online educational company Gale. Likewise, the Princeton Review's SAT guidebook prompts students: “Think about the 1960s. What comes to mind? Maybe it's the Beatles, dancing hippies, and Vietnam.” Hippies might be the most famous symbol of the 1960s; after all, they emerged in the middle of that decade.
But they didn't really hit their stride until the early 1970s, when their numbers and influence peaked. The hippies' drug subculture in the 1960s became youth pop culture in the '70s; issues of the stoner magazine High Times, founded in 1974, sold hundreds of thousands of copies. Rock-and-roll, once seen as a frivolous hobby for teenagers, became a serious artform and publications such as Rolling Stone became national tastemakers. And a quick perusal of nearly any high school yearbook well into the late '70s shows that long hair became standard for teenage boys across the country. Even some of the male teachers had shaggy cuts. Google Books' Ngram Viewer reveals the trajectory of America's fascination with the counterculture: The frequency of the term “hippies” peaked in books in 1971 and stayed above 1967 levels until 1977.
Myth No. 2
Hippies lived only in coastal cities or rural communes.
It's easy to imagine hippies clustering in California's Bay Area or among the Ivy League campuses of the Eastern Seaboard. In Scott MacFarlane's “The Hippie Narrative ,” for example, the author points out that Norman Mailer distinguished between “more visionary West Coast” hippies and “practical East Coast” hippies, with not a thought given to those who might have resided somewhere in between. Likewise, “The American Promise,” a high school history textbook , states that “hippie enclaves sprouted in low-rent districts of coastal cities and in rural communities.”
But hippies lived all over the United States, even in small and mid-size cities in the South and Midwest. The earliest flowering of hippie culture took place in coastal cities such as San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles, but head shops — purveyors of psychedelic posters, black lightbulbs and rolling papers — were popping up by 1967 in such cities as Atlanta, Cleveland and Omaha, as well as Austin, Ann Arbor and other college towns. Almost every city had a neighborhood or public place where hippies came together. Washington's hippies hung out on Dupont Circle, while Baltimore's gathered at that city's Washington Monument.
Meanwhile, countercultural newspapers were launched all over the country. To name just a few examples, Middle Earth appeared in Iowa City, Iowa; Chinook in Denver; Kudzu in Jackson, Miss.; and the improbably named Protean Radish in Chapel Hill, N.C.
Myth No. 3
Hippies were the ones protesting in the streets.
In the popular imagination, hippies with flowers in their hair were at the heart of the antiwar movement. The tumultuous political climate conjures images of “spoiled hippies protesting the Vietnam War,” as journalist Tom Jokinen put it in Hazlitt , or “hippies protesting the war in Vietnam,” as writer Robyn Price Pierre wrote in the Atlantic.
It's true that some countercultural groups, most notably the Yippies and the White Panther Party, blended radical politics with the hippie lifestyle. But antiwar protesters and hippies were usually two distinct groups . Hippies, often known as “freaks,” prioritized spiritual enlightenment, community building, and, of course, sex, drugs and rock-and-roll. Activists, often known as “politicos,” opted for more traditional forms of left-wing political organizing.
Many hippies were indifferent or even opposed to activists' political organizing, public meetings and marching. Writer, LSD enthusiast and “Merry Prankster” Ken Kesey shocked the audience at an antiwar event at the University of California at Berkeley in 1965 by declaring: “You're not going to stop this war with this rally, by marching. . . . They've been having wars for 10,000 years, and you're not going to stop it this way.”
Rather than marching or protesting, hippies hoped to change America by seceding from established political, social and cultural institutions, not by reforming them. No one expressed this sentiment more memorably than LSD guru Timothy Leary when they exhorted young Americans to “Turn on, tune in, drop out ” — meaning, in essence, to get high, disregard popular norms, quit bothering with mainstream society, and look inward for peace and wisdom.
Myth No. 4
Hippies were all about sexual liberation.
To many observers (and quite a few critics), hippies were synonymous with free love . In one incident during the 1968 Democratic National Convention, a Chicago police officer attacked a young woman who was protesting, saying: “You hippies are all alike. All you want is free love. Free love? I can give you some free love.” Indeed, in author Micah Lee Issit's guide to the counterculture, “free love” is described “as the hippie sexual ideal.”
While hippies were more sexually adventurous than mainstream Americans (one aspect of the counterculture that has had a lasting impact), they mostly stuck to heterosexual monogamy. As one aging hippie recounted decades later, that was more legend than fact . “We had parties where people would smoke too much or drink too much and sleep with their friends, but there were emotional repercussions the next day. Free love is like a free lunch — there's no such thing. . . . Even nudity was rare.”
Even within open relationships, hippie men often seized the freedom to sleep with multiple women but discouraged their girlfriends and wives from doing the same. Sadly, sexual relations in the counterculture weren't always consensual. Women in hippie neighborhoods — especially teenage girls who had run away from their parents — were often vulnerable to sexual assault as they faced peer pressure to embrace drugs and abandon sexual restraint. Chester Anderson, a writer associated with San Francisco's legendary Diggers collective, painted a devastating picture of sexual relations in the Summer of Love: “Rape is as common as bulls--- on Haight Street.”
Myth No. 5
The hippie fad eventually vanished.
“We are the children of the 60s and 70s kids, who were trying to figure out life after the 60s hippies died out,” writer Natalyn Chamberlain wrote in a lament for post-hippie culture in the online magazine Odyssey; a travel guide to oddball American locales similarly asserts that the hippies have “faded away,” while a Texas Monthly article by Peter Applebome reports that hippies “died out” sometime before 1982.
Yet it's less the case that the hippies died out, disappeared or faded away, and more that all of us became hippies. Indeed, a number of countercultural practices that were once seen as fringe are now widely accepted parts of American life. Yoga, to name one example, was championed by hippies long before it became a mainstream phenomenon. The same goes for organic food and vegetarian, whole-grain diets. And hippies celebrated casual dress, especially blue jeans and androgynous styles, rejecting the conventional wisdom that clothing should be formal and gender-specific. Their fashion sense paved the way for our current era, when many Americans wear casual clothing for all occasions and fewer and fewer workplaces require employees to dress up. All of these things, once considered symbols of the hippie lifestyle, are now fully entrenched in American culture.

Have you ever felt like you go through the motions every day but it all seems meaningless? Did you know that you can use science to help you find a sense of life purpose? Wait, but science can't answer life's big questions – that's the job of religion and traditional culture, right? Well, a wave of recent research in psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and other disciplines has explored how we find meaning and purpose in life!
I wish I knew that when I was growing up. I struggled with gaining a sense of life meaning and purpose throughout my teenage years and young adulthood. I remember experiencing the sense of meaninglessness as an emptiness deep in the pit of my stomach. This sense of life purpose is not a trivial matter. Recent studies show that people who feel that their life has meaning experience a substantially higher sense of wellbeing and even physical health.
To help you gain a richer sense of life meaning and purpose, we at Intentional Insights developed a free online course, which combines an engaging narrative style, academic research, and stories from people's everyday lives with exercises to help you discover your own sense of life purpose and meaning from a science-based perspective.

OKLAHOMA CITY-- An all-out brawl took place inside the halls of a metro high school, and now cell phone video shot by a student is making the rounds on social media.
It happened at John Marshal High School after a girls' volleyball game.
"I know there was a bat and possibly brass knuckles, knives,” parent Michael Mullin said. “How does that even get into play?"
The John Marshal volleyball team played Star-Spencer.
Mullin found out about the fight from their daughter. They escaped the brawl and immediately called them parents.
"She got out of the situation, but they called us frantically saying there is like a riot going on,” Mullin said. "So here we are hauling tail to get up here and all of a sudden we see police cars."
Mullin saw the video when is surfaced on social media.
"So I ask do any of the other parents know about this?” they said.
Mullin said they brought up violence to school officials before and the need for more school security especially during sporting events.
"Long story short,” they said. “This isn't the first time this has been a problem."
Oklahoma City Police were called and the report states the whole thing started over a boy.
The report also confirms brass knuckles and a baseball bat were in the mix, and one of the glass doors of the school was shattered.
"What I really want done is for somebody to step in a take a parent seriously,” Mullin said. "This is what's expected when you have no security there."
School officials say the fight was instigated by college students.
As far as security, they say they do all they can and that three school administrators were present when the fight broke out, but there was no security.
They also say charges are being pursued. The Oklahoma City Police Department is still investigating the matter.
The ban on consuming tap water has now been lifted in Longueuil, Que. following this week's diesel spill into the St. Lawrence River.
Officials say today's water quality test results confirm the water in the communities of Saint-Hubert, Vieux-Longueuil, Boucherville and Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville is safe to consume.
"The water may still have a funny smell or taste, but the water is safe to drink," said Longueuil Mayor Caroline St-Hilaire, who took a sip of a glass of water as they sat down at the press conference.
Officials said citizens' tap water should taste and smell normal again over the weekend.
They will also continue to test the water quality via mobile labs in order to ensure diesel levels do not rise.
Since Thursday, about 200,000 residents have had to drink and cook with bottled water.
Longueuil had promised to provide water, but that plan didn't go off smoothly.
A truckload of bottles water arrives at Colisée Jean Béliveau, a distribution centre in Longueuil, Que. on Thursday afternoon. (Pascal Robidas/Radio-Canada) There were long lines at several distribution centres on Thursday as residents waited for the arrival of supplies.
St-Hilaire said the city had handed out 400,000 litres of water in the last day and a half..
Mayor angry with federal government
St-Hilaire was furious with the federal government, and took to Twitter late Friday afternoon to express dismay.
"Environment Canada delayed for several hours today the decontamination work at the Longueuil filtration plant,” the Tweet read.
St-Hilaire said federal environment ministry officials showed up at the plant, ordered city employees to leave, sealed off areas of the plant and seized equipment as part of an investigation.
Later in a statement, the federal environment ministry denied that ever happened.
"The reports stating that Environment Canada sealed drinking water wells are not correct. Environment Canada did not issue any order regarding drinking water in the City of Longueuil, nor did it seal any well.
Environment Canada is providing support and scientific advice to the Quebec Ministry of the Environment, which is the lead agency," Environment Canada spokesperson Mélanie Quesnel told CBC in an email.
Provincial investigation underway
The water advisory was first put in place late Thursday morning — one day after 28,000 litres of diesel spilled into the St. Lawrence due to a generator leak at a water filtration plant in Longueuil.
Longueuil officials didn't immediately notify the province about the leak, which happened early Wednesday at around 4 a.m. Officials from Quebec's Urgence-Environneent arrived on the scene about six hours after the initial leak.
The city issued a statement on Wednesday saying the water was safe to drink.
But Thursday morning, after residents complained their tap water smelled like gas, the city ran tests and found the drinking water contained traces of diesel.
Quebec's environment ministry says it has launched an investigation, and the city of Longueuil could possible face legal action if the investigation finds that the situation was not handled properly.

CANNING AND THE TIN CAN by Andrew Boyd
Today, it's in the can. The University of Houston's College of Engineering presents this series about the machines that make our civilization run, and the people whose ingenuity created them.
T they year was 1809 and Napoleon had a problem. Their military campaigns were being disrupted — by food. It would spoil before reaching the front lines. So the French government offered a prize of twelve-thousand francs for a solution.
And that solution was canning. Nicholas Appert discovered that when food was heated to high temperatures then placed in tightly sealed containers, it would keep for long periods of time. (He made their discovery a half century before Pasteur's work on germ theory.) Appert is considered by many the father of canning. But they were missing one important innovation: the can. Appert used glass — not the most practical container for wartime transportation.
The can arrived on the scene just a year later when Englishman Peter Durand filed a patent for tin cans. The earliest tin plated cans looked a lot like today's — a flat sheet of metal wrapped to form a cylinder, with circular cutouts fastened onto each end. Cans were originally made by hand. The process of making the can and sterilizing the food was expensive and as a result canned food was consumed mostly by the military. Canned food found a home in the United States during the Civil War.
Oddly, it took another fifty years from the invention of the can to the invention of the can opener. Prior to that, hammers, chisels, and bayonets were the openers of choice. It's not difficult to imagine that can opening was a frequent cause of injury. It's also not entirely clear why the invention of the can opener took so long. Some point to the arrival of thinner metal cans, but it may simply have been that no one thought a specialized tool was necessary. After all, what were hammers and chisels for?
The earliest can-making craftsmen could complete sixty cans per day. According to the Can Manufacturers Institute, over 130 billion cans are now manufactured every year just in the United States. That's over four hundred cans per person. Of course, tin plated cans have ceded shelf space to aluminum cans, especially for beverages. And that has its advantages. Aluminum cans are one of the most efficiently recycled containers of any kind.
As advances in technology made cans less expensive to manufacture, they found their way into homes, and more and more types of food found their way into cans. Some foods — like tomatoes, beans, pineapple, and tuna — are very popular in cans. Others — like Spam and Spaghettios — have a smaller though passionate following.
Cans aren't glamorous. Canned peas can't compare with fresh. And canned milk takes some getting used to. But canned foods are easy to store and distribute. That means cans are still used in war, but today that's more often the war on hunger than on humankind.
I'm Andy Boyd at the University of Houston, where we're interested in the way inventive minds work.

Colourful event fills Norwich with Pride as members of the LGBT community from across Norfolk come to the city to celebrate
Last year's parade cemented the event as integral to the city's summer calendar, this year it has had to contend with a season of big British events, but is still looking as strong as ever. PHOTO: ANTONY KELLY © ARCHANT NORFOLK 2011
The Norwich Pride 2012 celebration is set to bring yoga, morris dancers, the town crier, show tunes and plenty of colour to the city this weekend.

The organisers of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) event, now in its fourth year, said they had worked hard to make it stand out in a summer of big happenings, and are looking to include more families and the wider community.
The big day is today, and will see a large picnic in Chapelfield Park and the usual vibrant parade through the city streets.
But the day will start with a symbol of how the movement has become integrated into the city, as the Gay Pride flag is raised at the Castle Museum.
Norwich Pride secretary Michelle Savage said: “The city has a good reputation for being diverse and creative. Norwich Pride is multi-generational. People bring their parents, children and grandchildren. There is a real sense of family, we see everybody standing up and saying ‘we want to live in a diverse city'.”
Outside The Forum at 10am, Jenni Chamberlain, chairperson of Norfolk County Council's Strategic Equality Group, will give a speech to open the event. All day long there will be LGBT films at Fusion Cinema in The Forum as well as stalls, events and talks.
The Pride Picnic begins at noon, with music and dance shows, and a workshop as part of the Football versus Homophobia movement. This will run between 2pm and 3pm, and the parade will begin about 2.15pm, after the town crier has assembled people in unique style in the park at 2pm.
“More and more organisations are taking part, we have messages of support from churches and shops holding displays,” said Ms Savage. “It is growing all the time. People know what Norwich Pride is, and they trust it.”
The events centre on Chapelfield Park and the Forum, with organisers promising that a Pride Show on Millennium Plain will be “the most exciting yet”. Ms Savage said: “We have a vision of turning Norwich into a rainbow. A place where people can feel safe and proud.”

Despite the recent legalization of marijuana in Colorado (and the subsequent 4/20 tourist packages and celebrations), employees in the state can still be fired by their employers if they test positive for the drug, even if they never show up to work stoned. Thursday afternoon, the Colorado Court of Appeals ruled that companies were within their right to terminate their pothead employees because marijuana is still illegal under federal law.
"For an activity to be lawful in Colorado, it must be permitted by, and not contrary to, both state and federal law," the appeals court stated in its 2-1 conclusion.
The case began when a medical marijuana user, Brandon Coats, 33, sued the Dish Network after the company fired them in 2010 for failing a drug test. Coats, who was paralyzed in a car crash as a teenager, had been a medical marijuana user in the state since 2009. Their case was dismissed in 2011 because marijuana use wasn't a “lawful activity.” Even with the recent legalization of the drug in Colorado, the state's court of appeals still upheld the initial decision.
"This case not only impacts Mr. Coats, but also some 127,816 medical-marijuana patient-employees in Colorado who could be summarily terminated even if they are in legal compliance with Colorado state law," [Coats's attorney Michael Evans] said in a statement.

Simple, reliable 2.5D photography
Note: You may also enjoy the Geiger-Mueller mood lamp project.
1. Intro and project goals
Alas, 3D scene reconstruction from series of freehand images is still an extremely hard problem in computing; while promising results in controlled settings are presented every now and then, the output is very far from being even vaguely acceptable for general-purpose photography: missing or incorrect data, stitching errors, low voxel / polygon accuracy, and severe texturing issues, seem to be nearly impossible to fully work around with today's technology. Virtually all usable 3D scans of real world objects are accomplished through different means: using fairly simple triangulating 3D laser scanners to capture a 3D model by observing how an off-axis laser beam "flows" around the analyzed shape, and then - optionally - projecting textures generated from aligned 2D images. This sort of full 3D acquisition is cumbersome and time-consuming enough to be out of question for casual applications, however.
As a CS buff, I am deeply impressed by the 3D scene reconstruction research; but as a long-time photographer, I couldn't help but wonder if major advances in photo processing could be made with much simpler tools. In particular, I was intrigued by 2.5D imaging (to borrow the term from the world of CNC machining): regular 2D pictures augmented with precise , per-pixel distance information, but no data about undercuts, backfaces, and so forth. This data alone would enable you to take a photo with a relatively small aperture, and then:
Automatically split objects into layers : accurate distance and distance continuity information could be used to very accurately isolate elements of the composition, and allow them to be selectively edited or even replaced - eliminating one of the most difficult and time-consuming steps in photo processing today.
: accurate distance and distance continuity information could be used to very accurately isolate elements of the composition, and allow them to be selectively edited or even replaced - eliminating one of the most difficult and time-consuming steps in photo processing today. Set focus and compute bokeh on software level : since per-pixel distance information is available, it is possible to apply (and then tweak) selective, highly realistic blur as a function of distance, to achieve the desired aesthetic effect after all the retouching and composition changes are done. Creative bokeh effects would be also easy to achieve. (A comparable goal is also being pursued with specialized sensor and aperture designs.)

Creative bokeh effects would be also easy to achieve. Apply volumetric effects : a number of other depth-based 2.5D filters could be conceivably created, most notably including advanced, dimensional lighting and fog.
: a number of other depth-based 2.5D filters could be conceivably created, most notably including advanced, dimensional lighting and fog. Still use existing 2D software: since all mainstream 2D photo manipulation programs feature extensive support for layers and grayscale masks, their existing features could be easily leveraged to intuitively work with 2.5D photography, without the need to develop proprietary editing frameworks.
There are several ways to create 2.5D depth maps, and I toyed, for example, with the concept of varying focal length and then measuring pixel contrast in function of this setting (bad news: it yields vaguely usable distance information for well-defined edges only, and is horribly noisy everywhere else). Another approach is simply to dumb down a 3D scanner: attach a pattern-projecting diode laser module to a servo, and install it on camera's hot shoe. The laser could then rapidly sweep the scene - and by the virtue of being slightly off the optical axis, distance information could be easily triangulated by measuring pattern displacement. To explain a bit better, consider this simple case:
Naturally, sweeping the scene with a single dot would be painful - hundreds of thousands of readings would need to be taken to collect data with reasonable resolution; sweeping the target with a horizontal line provides non-ambiguous data for an entire row of pixels instead. It is worth noting that this principle could be taken even further - several projects resorted to projecting series of lines for 3D imaging purposes (also known as structured light scanning) - but this approach creates ambiguities in non-contiguous regions, and these are very difficult to reliably resolve in software.
When I first thought of building such a device in 2005 (and experimented a bit), the biggest problem would be that a very significant number of stills would still need to be taken to achieve a reasonable vertical resolution, taking several minutes - and several hundred shutter cycles - per every photo. Lowering Y resolution would be possible with simple, well-defined subjects - but all in all, this still seemed problematic. Using a video camera for high fps acquisition seemed like a possibility - but individual frames from a reasonably priced digicam were simply unusable for any type of photo work due to limited resolution.
Thankfully, in recent years, we witnessed the arrival of digital SLR cameras with unprecedented video capture capabilities, producing pixel-perfect captures at 30 fps without interlacing, minimal compression artifacts, acceptable resolutions, amazing low-light performance, and full manual controls. With Canon EOS 5D Mark II in hand, I decided to give the project another try.
2. Scanner design
WARNING: point beams from lasers over about 10 mW can cause eye damage or ruin camera sensors; and starting around 100 mW, they can also set many things on fire. Line-generating optics greatly decrease power per surface area, so they aren't nearly as risky as long as they are attached securely - but still, exercise caution.
NOTE: Following various minor but well-published incidents during sporting events or riots, several countries - most notably Australia - rolled out knee-jerk regulations banning the sale of virtually all useful lasers to general public. These regulations are generally poorly enforced, especially for Internet purchases - but it is still your responsibility to stay compliant.
The optics should be picked to match the angle of view of your lens: a line around 100° is best for wide-angle (16-35 mm or so), 50° for standard portrait lens (50-105 mm), and under 20° for telephoto (135 mm and beyond). Nothing bad will happen if the line is much wider than the frame, to be sure - other than the need for a more powerful laser to achieve the same level of illumination.
With the right laser in hand, you need to find a suitable power supply, and mount it on a high ratio geared motor (or a really slow servo), so that it can smoothly sweep the entire scene - covering both a distant object near the top of the frame, and the closest you plan to photograph near the bottom. The RPM needs to be selected to provide a sufficient resolution: around 150-300 discrete readings in the Y axis are probably optimal, and at 30 fps, this means about 5-10 seconds of screen time. For wide angle, about 0.5 - 1.5 RPM is needed; for normal portrait lens, 0.25 - 0.5 RPM may be more suitable; and for telephoto, plan for 0.15 - 0.2 RPM.
Note that you can't simply grab a nominally faster, low-cost servo, and pulse it to achieve lower RPM: most of them have a very limited angular resolution, and can't be positioned accurately enough. You can build a simple transmission to lower the RPM, though, or lower the driving voltage a bit. In any case, the key to success is smooth, seamless rotation of the laser.
If you are not using a servo, you should also equip the motor with a home position sensor - a microswitch or an optointerrupter - to be able to start from a known location. The whole setup needs to be hooked up to your computer or an autonomous microcontroller (possibly through a H-bridge driver and a power Darlington to turn the laser on and off), and programmed to exeute the following algorithm:
If the limiting switch is currently closed, go to 3. Rotate up until the switch is triggered. Abort if position not reached in expected time. Momentarily reverse the motor to avoid cramming the switch too hard. Wait for keypress. Turn on laser. Rotate down for predefined time needed to sweep the scene. Abort if the limiting switch not depressed in time.
Optionally: make a short stop in the middle to key in reference reading. Turn off laser. Go to 1.
The operator needs to follow this procedure:
Set up camera on a tripod, power up the scanner. Capture the actual image to be augmented with depth information. Adjust exposure to a predefined level suitable for capturing the projected line (overexposure reduces accuracy, underxposure limits scan range). Start recording video, capturing at least one reference frame with no laser beam present. Press the button to start scan. Stop recording once the laser shuts off.
The following photos document the mechanical design of my scanner (see my CNC maching guide for a better explanation of what's going on).

8) Another take of the finished device:
3. Depth map software
Subtract the reference frame. Extract color channel matching laser wavelength. For each column: Normalize brightness. Find beam start and end location. Reject column if values abnormal. Triangulate distance of start and end locations based on focal length, approximated laser angle at this time code. If necessary, interpolate between data points (snapping to detected edges when interpolating non-contiguous regions). Create layers by isolating non-continuos regions in the depth map.
My initial tests, however, settled for something far more primitive - simply locating the frame for which pixel value is the highest, and correlating this with scanner angular position to compute unfiltered distance data. Still, the first scan isn't exactly horrible. Here's a reference "daylight" capture of the test scene (including a somewhat challenging, reflective marble surface):
And here's the raw, unedited 2.5D scan data:
4. Questions, comments...
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea's firing of a ballistic missile over Japan could increase pressure on Washington to consider shooting down future test launches, although there is no guarantee of success and U.S. officials are wary of a dangerous escalation with Pyongyang.
More attention is likely to focus on the prospects for intercepting a missile in flight after North Korea on Tuesday conducted one of its boldest missile tests in years, one government official said.
Such a decision would not be taken lightly given tensions over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.
And while President Donald Trump has repeatedly vowed that “all options are on the table”, there has been no sign of any quick policy shift in Washington toward direct U.S. military action.
But Pyongyang's launch of an intermediate-range Hwasong-12 missile over Japan's northern Hokkaido island underscored how Trump's tough rhetoric, pursuit of sanctions and occasional shows of military force around the Korean peninsula have done little to deter North Korea's leader.
“Kim Jong-un has chosen to thumb their nose at the Americans and Japanese by conducting this test,” said David Shear, former U.S. assistant secretary of defense for East Asia.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has already pledged that the military would shoot down any missile it deemed a danger to U.S. or allied territory.
What is unclear is whether Washington would be prepared to use its multi-layered missile defense systems to intercept a missile like the one that overflew Japan but never directly threatened its territory.
Doing so would essentially be a U.S. show of force rather than an act of self-defense.
“I would think that in government deliberations that would likely be one of the options out on the table,” Shear said.
Some analysts say there is a danger that North Korea would see it as an act of war and retaliate militarily with potentially devastating consequences for South Korea and Japan.
China, North Korea's neighbor and main trading partner, would also likely oppose such a direct U.S. military response.
MINIMIZING DAMAGE
Experts say there is no guarantee that U.S. missile defense systems, including Aegis ballistic missile defense ships in the region and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems based in Guam and South Korea, would hit their target, despite recent successful tests.
A failed attempt would be an embarrassment to the United States and could embolden North Korea, which this year has already conducted two tests of an intercontinental ballistic missile believed capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.
The United States has spent $40 billion over 18 years on research and development into missile defense systems but they have never been put into operation under wartime conditions.
Mattis this month expressed confidence the U.S. military could intercept a missile fired by North Korea if it was headed to Guam, after North Korea said it was developing a plan to launch four intermediate range missiles to land near the U.S. territory.
If North Korea fired at the United States, the situation could quickly escalate to war, Mattis said.
GROWING THREAT
Not everyone is convinced the U.S. military can defend against North Korea's growing missile capability.
Some experts caution that U.S. missile defenses are now geared to shooting down one, or perhaps a small number, of incoming missiles. If North Korea's technology and production keep advancing, U.S. defenses could be overwhelmed.
“If a shootdown fails, it would be embarrassing, though not terribly surprising,” said Michael Elleman, a missile expert at the 38 North think tank in Washington.
“Missile defense does not provide a shield that protects against missiles. Rather, it is like air defense; it is designed to minimize the damage an adversary can inflict,” they said.
One U.S. official said the military would be especially cautious about shooting down a North Korean missile that did not pose a direct threat because of the risk of civilian casualties if it were intercepted over Japan or South Korea, as well as difficulty in determining how Pyongyang might retaliate. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.

U.S. military and intelligence officials warn North Korea could unleash a devastating barrage of missiles and artillery on Seoul and U.S. bases in South Korea in response to any military attack.
Targeting of a North Korean missile in flight that did not endanger the United States or its allies could also raise legal questions. U.N. Security Council resolutions that ban Pyongyang's ballistic missile programs do not explicitly authorize such actions.
Japan also faces questions over the legality of shooting down missiles in its airspace but not aimed at Japan. Under legislation passed in 2015, Tokyo can exercise a limited right of collective self-defense, or militarily aiding an ally under attack, if it judges the threat to Japan as “existential”.
