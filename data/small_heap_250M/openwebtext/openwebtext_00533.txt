A 15-year-old Saudi girl living in Germany has written to the The Unicode Consortium, the company which designs Apple's emojis, demanding that the company introduce an emoji of a woman wearing an Islamic headscarf.
Rayouf Alhumedhi argued that the headscarf is worn by millions of women and should therefore be introduced to improve the representation of Muslim women.
“People want to be acknowledged and recognised, especially in the tech world. This is massive. Emojis are everywhere,” the girl said.
“There are so many Muslim women in this world who wear the headscarf. It might seem trivial, but it's different when you see yourself on the keyboard around the world. Once you experience that, it's really great,” she continued.
The idea was supported by the co-founder of Reddit, Alexis Ohanian, who decided to host a live online discussion on the platform in order for the girl to receive feedback on her idea.
Other emojis available on Apple devices include the Sikh turban, same-sex parents, and a range of different skin colours.
If the idea receives the approval of Apple, it could be released as early as 2017.

A tiny New Hampshire startup is revolutionizing the way millions of patients take their daily medicines--and threatening the business model of titans like CVS and Walgreens in the process.
Allen Pittinger-Dunham, 51, has been taking HIV medicines since 2003. A few years in, his viral counts started to creep up, and his doctor put him on a much more complicated regimen that required him to take ten pills a day. Cathy Benedetti, a 38-year-old nurse, faces a similar problem with her elderly parents, who live 1,000 miles away from her. Each of them takes at least 16 prescription drugs every day. "They were so overwhelmed," says Benedetti. "They had literally a box of bottles, and they said every night, 'I don't want to deal with pillboxes.'"
The problem of medication overload is a big one. Some 32 million Americans--10% of the population--are on at least five different prescription drugs. A 2005 study found that half of all Americans on medications don't take them properly, adding $100 billion a year to U.S. health care costs.
Pittinger-Dunham and Benedetti have settled on the same solution to the problem: a small startup pharmacy based in Manchester, N.H. called PillPack. The company sends them their prescription drugs by mail order (nothing new there), but instead of sending all the Lipitor in one bottle and the Viread in another, pills are sorted together into clear plastic wrappers printed with the date and time at which they should be taken. No more wondering if you remembered to take your Diovan or counting how many Lasixes are left in the bottle. The service--including shipping--costs customers about the same as picking up the prescription at the local pharmacy.
"It takes all the worries that I may have away," says Pittinger-Dunham. Benedetti says: "It's peace of mind for everyone involved."
The idea of prepackaging pills by dosage--organizing them before they even reach the patient--isn't new. In 2006 researchers at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. found that by putting pills in blister packs, they upped the proportion of people who took their medicine from 61% to 97%. What is new is turning that idea into a business with the potential to rival CVS or Walgreens.
PillPack cofounder and Chief Executive T.J. Parker, 29, is the son of a pharmacist and grew up working at his dad's drugstore, making deliveries as a teenager to people who could not leave their houses. He went to school at the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy but found that he didn't like what the business was becoming.
"It's not that the pharmacists at CVS and Duane Reade aren't trying to help, but they don't have the infrastructure or tools to do anything about it," says Parker, who was featured earlier this year in the FORBES 30 Under 30 list of young innovators. "I didn't want to work at a traditional retail pharmacy. I wasn't interested."
At first Parker went to work for his dad, who had a proto-PillPack business that packaged drugs and delivered them to patients in nursing homes. But Parker saw more potential in using the Internet to take the same packaging ideas to the masses. Working on MIT's Hacking Medicine, a hackathon for health care startups, he met Elliot Cohen, a Sloan M.B.A. In 2012 he and Cohen pitched PillPack and won the contest. Soon after, they started the company, with Cohen signing on as CTO and cofounder. Cohen had a line into the venture capital community and nabbed Founder Collective as the company's first investor, in a $550,000 seed round.
PillPack has gone on to raise $12.8 million. The company won't disclose numbers, but FORBES estimates the startup could hit some $15 million in revenue this year, with 15% to 20% margins. "The day we agreed on the investment, I was cooking omelets for T.J. and his wife," says Accel Partners' Fred Destin. "I still have a scar because I burned myself on the pan."
At their 5,000-square-foot mill, built in the early 1900s and still with its original 6-inch-thick wood floors, patient prescriptions are fed into a robot the size of a large filing cabinet (the system is used in hospitals but hasn't been used for consumers in the U.S. until now). The machine contains canisters of the 400 highest-volume pills used by PillPack; a pharmacist loads more unusual prescriptions by hand. Each drug is labeled by bar code and checked by both the machine and a pharmacist.
The company now employs 66 people; 15 have the sole job of helping patients transfer their prescriptions from brick-and-mortar pharmacies over to PillPack. The company is licensed in 47 states. Oklahoma, Louisiana and Oregon are the holdouts.
By focusing on only large-volume repeat customers, Parker says he's able to stock far fewer medications than most neighborhood pharmacies, keeping costs--and prices--low. The design of the product itself is also a cost-saver, allowing the company to ship multiple prescriptions at once to a single patient.
The company is creating a smartphone app that will remind patients to take their pills. PillPack has discovered that tech-savvy customers like to renew prescriptions by e-mailing instead of picking up the phone as with a traditional pharmacy.
Still, if the model takes off, won't one of pharmacy's big players imitate his idea? Parker shrugs off the thought. Drugstores are rated low when it comes to customer service. He doesn't think that's going to change anytime soon.
Besides, "people are so used to having to deal with this--the trips to the pharmacy, sorting the pillboxes, nagging the pharmacy for refills," he says. "People who have been doing this for any amount of time are thankful that we exist."

Celebrities took to social media Thursday to condemn Senator Al Franken (D-MN) over a photo of him groping journalist and talk radio anchor Leeann Tweeden while she was sleeping, with some stars, like actress and liberal activist Alyssa Milano, calling on the Democratic lawmaker to resign from office.
Tweeden posted a 2006 photo to Twitter Thursday showing Franken grabbing her breast during a two week USO Tour. The TalkRadio 790 KABC anchor also detailed how Franken allegedly shoved his tongue down her throat without her consent during a rehearsal for a USO skit.
One of the more forceful reactions to the photo came from Charmed star Alyssa Milano, who said Franken can no longer represent the women of Minnesota.
“Zero tolerance. If we don't hold all accountable for horrible behavior — nothing changes. Sorry, @SenAlFranken you should not be in a position to represent the female constituents in your state,” Milano wrote, linking to Tweeden's post.

Actor Terry Crews, who filed a police report last week with the LAPD over an alleged assault by top Hollywood talent agent Adam Venit, said Franken “must be held accountable.”
Actor Tom Arnold said Franken “needs to own this right now or get out,” while Thor Ragnarok star Mark Ruffalo said Franken's alleged behavior is “acceptable.”

Franken issued two apologies to Tweeden Thursday and called for a Senate ethics probe into his own behavior.
“I am asking that an ethics investigation be undertaken, and I will gladly cooperate,” he wrote.
Tweeden said in an appearance on CNN Thursday that she “gladly accepts” Franken's apology.
Reaction, however, continues to pour in with Hollywood stars hammering the comedian turned politician.

Apparently, the Clintons have parted ways with the vast majority of fellow Democrats, as well as civil rights and business groups, on the importance of annually measuring student progress against state academic benchmarks. Just last week, stumping on the campaign trail, former President Bill Clinton announced that Hillary Clinton "thinks the federal government requires too many tests for U.S. schoolchildren."
Unlike the phony debate about Common Core on the Republican side, this is an issue where the policies of the next president will actually matter. And if Hillary Clinton acted to roll back what are already fairly minimal federal testing requirements, it would be to the detriment of our students, particularly poor and minority children, children of recent immigrants and students with disabilities.
It's likely no coincidence that Bill Clinton made these comments in the lead-up to the Democratic primary in New York, where polls show the former secretary of state with a narrower lead than expected over rival and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The announcement also came on the eve of the first day of annual student testing in New York, where some largely well-to-do, suburban activists have been advocating that parents opt their children out of taking state assessments.
To be clear, we support efforts to minimize the time spent on student testing. Last year, we joined a diverse array of organizations – including the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association – in support of legislation to eliminate low-quality and unnecessary tests. That legislation is now federal law, part of the Every Student Succeeds Act signed by President Barack Obama last December.
The problem with this new wrinkle in Hillary Clinton's K-12 education agenda is the assertion that the federal government is to blame for over-testing. Nothing could be further from the truth. On average, federal policies account for seven hours of testing per year – roughly 0.6 percent of an average school year. The time students spend on assessments required by states and school districts is, on average, two to three times that required by the federal government.
Bill Clinton has said that he'd like to roll back the clock and return to the testing policies of his administration, when kids were tested just once in elementary school, once in middle school and once in high school. But, as the Clintons know, these policies came under criticism from a wide array of stakeholders because they did not provide frequent or useful enough information to parents, teachers or administrators. Nor did they chart the progress of individual students and schools from year to year. For these reasons, Democrats like the late Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy, working with a broad bipartisan coalition, succeeded in expanding annual testing in reading and math to all grades three through eight. As a member of the Senate Education Committee, Hillary Clinton was not only integrally involved in, but also voted for this change.
Last year, Congress reaffirmed the policy of annual testing with overwhelming bipartisan margins of support. In fact, 43 of 46 Democratic senators – including Sanders – voted last year in favor of an amendment that not only continued annual math and reading assessments in grades three through eight, but also required that the results be used to rate schools and that interventions occur when large proportions of students, especially those from historically disadvantaged groups, are not meeting state benchmarks. Virtually every major civil rights group in the country endorsed that amendment, as did the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and advocates for students with disabilities.
Bill Clinton argues that the money spent on student testing could be better used elsewhere. But the cost of federal and state testing combined is less than $35 per student. What's more, that investment yields substantial dividends. One study showed that the annual testing required in all states after 2002 resulted in states and localities increasing their support for education by $600 per pupil, as the information uncovered by assessments compelled states moved to invest more to raise student achievement. In addition, the testing requirements in federal law have been accompanied for the last decade by billions in targeted funding for school turnarounds in high-poverty schools.
What anti-testing advocates are failing to tell our parents and communities is that getting rid, or opting out, of standardized assessments disproportionately harms poor students and students of color who are already in areas plagued by a lack of resources, where high-poverty schools struggle to offer advanced classes and attract good teachers and counselors. These communities depend on the insights gleaned from testing for funding and allocations that are intended to direct resources where they're needed the most – in order to actually address the systemic inequities holding too many of our kids back from reaching their fullest potential. That's what civil rights groups have learned over the past two decades. That's why they strongly support these policies.
While assessments aren't the end-all, be-all answer to solving the real issues facing our education system, we will never know how our schools are performing without some form of benchmarks and, at the very least, accurate annual reports on school and student progress. I ask Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and others who criticize an annual test of student progress to rethink their positions and ally with the vast majority of fellow Democrats, civil rights and business groups in support of policies that best serve those children who, without regular monitoring of their progress, won't be given the opportunity to learn to their utmost potential.
Tokyo-headquartered online game publisher Nexon has posted increases in revenue and profits year-over-year, thanks to the company's focus on the free-to-play business model.
The company said it saw strong growth for its free-to-play and online games in China and Korea during the quarter, although this was slightly offset by an underwhelming performance for its games on North America. This, it said, was a result of "certain operational challenges" in the region.
Even with these issues, Nexon still managed to exceed its expected performance for the first quarter.
Nexon said that a number of the titles it launched in 2011, including Cyphers, SD Three Kingdoms and Mabinogi Heroes, maintained strong growth throughout this fiscal year's first quarter. In particular, iOS and Android game Kartrider Rush has now been downloaded 8.2 million times to date.
Although the company's monthly active user count declined slightly to 82.8 million from 86.2 million year-over-year, it saw its paying user rate increase to 10.9 percent of its total users paying, from 8.3 percent year-over-year.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2012, Nexon posted revenues of 30.4 billion yen ($381.1 million), up 46 percent compared to 20.8 billion ($261.1 million) year-over-year. Of this total figure, 15.2 billion yen ($190.4 million) -- around half -- came from China, while 8.9 billion yen ($111.1 million) came from Korea. In comparison, 1.4 billion yen ($17.5 million) came from North America.
The company posted quarterly profits of 12.4 billion yen ($155.3 million), up 63 percent compared to 7.6 billion yen ($95.2 million) year-over-year.
Emma Watson stars in the upcoming film Regression, and to play the emotionally wrenching role, the 24-year-old English actress has made a choice that could prove controversial for the star who was recently named The Ms. Foundation's Top Feminist Celebrity of 2014. According to reports from early screenings of Regression, Watson has chosen to appear topless in at least one scene.
Whether the single scene in which the former Harry Potter starlet appears with her breasts exposed will survive until the film's actual release date, on August 28, 2015, is uncertain. According to reports from those preview screenings, audience members judged the potentially controversial scene “useless and ineffective.”
One of the preview screenings attendees said that it appears Emma Watson, while she may have made a courageous choice to go topless while playing a woman who claims she was sexually abused by her father, may have played the scene only halfway.
“You can see her breasts but they are partially obscured,” the preview attendee said. “I think she may have been wearing pasties to cover her nipples.”
This year, Watson was appointed a United Nations Women Goodwill Ambassador, and was named top Feminist Celebrity of 2014 by the Ms. Foundation For Women.
“We celebrate all feminists every day, but today we're giving a hat tip to celebrities who are helping to promote women's equality,” said foundation CEO Teresa Younger, introducing the list topped by Watson. “Every celebrity on the list has either embraced the term ‘feminist', spoken out for women's equal rights or battled against sexist oppression.”
Also appearing on the list were Laverne Cox, Rachel Maddow, Beyonce, Cher, Amy Poehler, Tina Fey, Meryl Streep, Mindy Kaling, and Ann Curry.
Given the nature of her role in Regression, it appears highly unlikely that Emma Watson will be accused of playing her partially nude scene — if indeed it makes the final cut of the film — for sexually titillating purposes.
According to summaries of the film's plot appearing on the Internet Movie Database and elsewhere online, Watson plays a young woman who accuses her father of sexually abusing her, but the father has no memory of committing the crime.
A detective (Ethan Hawke) and a psychologist (David Thewlis) then help the man uncover his suppressed memories, which in turn expose a terrifying nationwide conspiracy.
Emma Watson recently finished filming Regression, which is helmed by 42-year-old Alejandro Amenábar. The Spanish director also made the 2001 ghost story thriller The Others, which starred Nicole Kidman.
Leaked documents reveal the NSA is collecting cellphone metadata from users in the Philippines, Kenya and Mexico, as well as voice calls in the Bahamas and one unidentified country
Published 4:52 PM, May 22, 2014
MANILA, Philippines – Last March, The Washington Post reported that the US National Security Agency (NSA) had built a surveillance system via a project called MYSTIC that could record an entire nation's telephone calls and store them for up to one month.
The report, based on documents released by former US government contractor Edward Snowden, showed that the NSA is using MYSTIC for surveillance operations in 5 countries mostly to collect metadata (time, source and destination of calls) but in 2 of the 5 countries also entire voice calls.
This week, The Intercept – set up as an online platform to release documents provided by Edward Snowden – named 4 of those 5 countries. The report identified the 3 countries where metadata (time, source and destination of calls) is being collected: the Philippines, Kenya, and Mexico.
The Intercept also reported that the NSA is recording “virtually every cellphone conversation on the island nation of the Bahamas” and one other nation that it has chosen not to name because doing so could lead to “increased violence.”
The program that the NSA uses to record and store voice calls is called SOMALGET and was implemented without consent of the Bahamian government.
The NSA reportedly gained access to the democratic country's cellular network via a separate agreement with the US Drug Enforcement Administration. Leaked NSA documents revealed SOMALGET was deployed in the Bahamas to track down “international narcotics traffickers and special-interest alien smugglers.”
According to a report in the Nassau Guardian the Bahamian government has reached out to the United States asking them to explain the spy claims.
Meanwhile, Wikileaks isn't happy about The Intercept's decision to leave out the name of the 5th country. Following a heated argument on Twitter, the website promised to name the 5th country on Thursday, May 22.

Cleaning festival loos, hugging stray cats and dogs, and scraping chewing gum off the streets are just some of the uninviting tasks people have agreed to in exchange for free WiFi. And we aren't just talking about a few hundred unfortunate individuals. Over 22,000 people have openly agreed to carry out 1,000 hours of community service after we added the spoof clause into our terms and conditions over a two-week period.
A “Community Service Clause” was added to our usual terms and stated: The user may be required, at Purple's discretion, to carry out 1,000 hours of community service. This may include the following:
Cleansing local parks of animal waste
Providing hugs to stray cats and dogs
Manually relieving sewer blockages
Cleaning portable lavatories at local festivals and events
Painting snail shells to brighten up their existence
Scraping chewing gum off the streets
Don't worry, we aren't going to round up these individuals and ask them to don their rubber gloves and repay the community debt. The real reason behind our experiment is to highlight the lack of consumer awareness when signing up to use free guest WiFi. All users were given the chance to flag up the questionable clause in return for a prize, but remarkably only one individual, which is 0.000045% of all WiFi users throughout the whole two-weeks, managed to spot it.
Commenting on the results, Gavin Wheeldon, CEO of Purple, said: “WiFi users need to read terms when they sign up to access a network. What are they agreeing to, how much data are they sharing, and what license are they giving to providers? Our experiment shows it's all too easy to tick a box and consent to something unfair.”
Notice: JavaScript is required for this content.
We've unveiled the findings of our experiment to coincide with today's announcement that we are the first General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliant WiFi provider. The European legislation, which comes into force on May 25th 2018, will reshape the way organisations approach data privacy and allow end users to gain more access to the data collected about them. One of GDPR's headline rulings is the introduction of ‘unambiguous consent' before users' personal or behavioural data can be used for marketing purposes. The results from our experiment clearly support the inclusion of ‘unambiguous consent' in the GDPR rulings.
In response to both GDPR and the results we obtained in our experiment, we have modified our privacy policy so it is clearer, simpler and shorter. In fact, our privacy policy is now only 260 words long rather than 1600, which means people should be more open to reviewing the terms before clicking ‘accept'. Our access journey has also been tweaked so that users have more clarity around how their data will be used, for what purposes, and by whom.
Gavin Wheeldon says: “We welcome the strengthening of data protection laws across Europe that GDPR will bring. Not only will it give WiFi end users more control over how their personal data is being used by companies, it will also raise the level of trust in the digital economy.”
Another new feature which has been announced today is our brand-new Profile Portal, which gives end users complete transparency of all the data collected about them and also allows them to modify their marketing preferences.
Gavin adds: “Purple's Profile Portal means that all end users worldwide have the comfort of knowing they can control how their data is being used. And if they're happy to hug a few stray dogs at the same time it's a win-win.”

Ok, so I'm tough to buy for. I didn't put a wishlist on redditgifts because...I tend to buy stuff for myself that I want, and the things I don't buy for myself are too expensive for a wishlist! Besides, I like surprises.
I did mention in my redditgifts info for my Secret Santa that I like guns, cars, and women, and not necessarily in that order. I mentioned a few other likes, but really -- I wouldn't want to have to buy for me.
My Secret Santa though, is awesome. Seriously awesome.
First, before any sort of package ever arrived, my Secret Santa noted that I had said I would like to learn the skill of flying, and sent me a link to a super-realistic free flight simulator I wasn't aware of. It is an amazing bit of software, and I am so happy my Secret Santa told me about it!
Oh, then later, I mentioned that one of the TV shows I liked was Battlestar Galatica, so my Secret Santa told me that I could put my new-found flying skills to use and sent me a link to a very cool online Battlestar Galatica game. This was all just nice stuff they told me about before sending something!
The next thing they sent me was a super-rare vinyl rip of the holiday soundtrack for "Nutcracker Fantasy" from 1979. I wasn't previously aware of this animated film, but it is right up my alley and super-appropriate for the season. Too cool!
But then, an envelope arrived in the mail. I'll describe its contents blow-by-blow in the picture gallery, but my Secret Santa got me...
...a charitable gift in my name to an organization dedicated to screening and restoring rare film prints. This totally fits with my personality and likes, and it is an amazingly-creative thing for them to think of.
...a ticking time bomb package, with instructions to cut the red wire or the blue wire...and it sounded like some puppies weren't going to make it if I made the wrong choice! I had a hard time choosing. I like puppies and didn't want to be responsible for puppygeddon! In the end I picked blue (because red sounds kindof dangerous), and thankfully the puppies are now safe! Hooray!
Oh wait -- did I mention that I said I liked women? My Secret Santa also got me a very cool Goldfinger postcard with ... a golden woman! ... on it! Very creative, and as James Bond is one of my favorite film series, I love this.
Inside the time bomb package was a blu-ray of "The Contract" with Morgan Freeman and John Cusack. Not only are these two of my favorite actors, but my Secret Santa picked out a movie that fits perfectly with my likes...and magically one which I somehow haven't seen yet! I'm stoked!
But wait...there's more! My Secret Santa also included a collection of exotic creatures for me, from an okapicorn to a lightning pug to a uni-caticorn, to a creeping husk. These are really cool line-drawings which I can color in. Secret Santa -- I promise I'll try really hard to stay between the lines. Really, I will. I always failed art class, but still -- these are awesome and I'm going to try to do as good of a job as I can.
There was also a little card with punch-outs of various exotic animals...lion, rhinocerous, egale, giraffe, lizard, palm tree (well, that's not an animal, but you get the idea). I like the little creatures, and the card itself will serve as a pretty cool stencil for these too.
Last but not least, my Secret Santa included a Lotus F1 E20 racecar for me to color! Remember above I said I liked cars? Well, not only do I like cars, but Lotus is pretty much my favorite car company (and racing marque), ever. Ferrari can suck the big one. "Add lightness", said Colin Chapman, the founder of Lotus. A mantra to live by.
As of right now, my Secret Santa is still unknown to me, but I'm hoping they'll 'out' themself to me so that I can give credit where it is due! UPDATE: My Secret Santa is Sassasaurus! Thank you, Sassasaurus!!!! You rock!!!!!!
They hit the nail on the head with each and every one of their gifts and nothing is going to remove the grin from my face today!
Thank you!!!!!!! You really have no idea what an excellent job you did. I love each and every one of the gifts, and the fact that a stranger on the internet could be this creative and take their time to send such an awesome set of things to me (plus the gift to the film print preservation organization!) just boggles the mind. I am truly grateful!
Tom Venuto is a natural bodybuilder, certified strength and conditioning specialist (CSCS) and a certified personal trainer (CPT). I've learned so much from Tom through his truth about fat loss. is a natural bodybuilder, certified strength and conditioning specialist (CSCS) and a certified personal trainer (CPT). I've learned so much from Tom through his Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle Program . No hype, no gimmicks — Tom shoots straight from the hip, and tells you theabout fat loss.
Earlier this week someone in our discussion forum wrote, “I haven't “LOST” any fat… I know EXACTLY where it went! I got a chuckle out of that because I “got” the joke, but truth is, most people really don't know how fat cells work, how the fat burning process takes place or where the fat goes when it's burned. It's actually quite a complex biochemical process, but I'll explain it as simply as possible, so by the end of this article, you'll be a “fat burning” expert!
When you “lose” body fat, the fat cell (also called an adipocyte) does not go anywhere or “move into the muscle cell to be burned. The fat cell itself, (unfortunately) stays right where it was – under the skin in your thighs, stomach, hips, arms, etc., and on top of the muscles – which is why you can't see muscle “definition” when your body fat is high.
Fat is stored inside the fat cell in the form of triaglycerol. The fat is not burned right there in the fat cell, it must be liberated from the fat cell through somewhat complex hormonal/enzymatic pathways. When stimulated to do so, the fat cell simply releases its contents (triaglycerol) into the bloodstream as free fatty acids (FFA's), and they are transported through the blood to the tissues where the energy is needed.
A typical young male adult stores about 60,000 to 100,000 calories of energy in body fat cells. What triggers the release of all these stored fatty acids from the fat cell? Simple: When your body needs energy because you're consuming fewer calories than you are burning (an energy deficit), then your body releases hormones and enzymes that signal your fat cells to release your fat reserves instead of keeping them in storage.
For stored fat to be liberated from the fat cell, hydrolysis (lipolysis or fat breakdown), splits the molecule of triaglycerol into glycerol and three fatty acids. An important enzyme called hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) is the catalyst for this reaction. The stored fat (energy) gets released into the bloodstream as FFA's and they are shuttled off to the muscles where the energy is needed. As blood flow increases to the active muscles, more FFA's are delivered to the muscles that need them.
An important enzyme called lipoprotein lipase (LPL), then helps the FFA's get inside the mitochondria of the muscle cell, where the FFA's can be burned for energy. If you've ever taken a biology class, then you've probably heard of the mitochondria. This is the “cellular powerhouse” where energy production takes place and this is where the FFA's go to be burned for energy.
When the FFA's are released from the fat cell, the fat cell shrinks and that's why you look leaner when you lose body fat – because the fat cell is now smaller. A small or “empty” fat cell is what you're after if you want the lean, defined look.
It was once believed that the number of fat cells could not increase after adulthood, only the size of the fat cells could increase (or decrease). We now know that fat cells can indeed increase both in size (hypertrophy) and in number (hyperplasia) and that they are more likely to increase in number at certain times and under certain circumstances, such as 1) during late childhood and early puberty, 2) During pregnancy, and 3) During adulthood when extreme amounts of weight are gained
Some people are genetically predisposed to have more fat cells than others and women have more fat cells than men. An infant usually has about 5 – 6 billion fat cells. This number increases during early childhood and puberty, and a healthy adult with normal body composition has about 25 to 30 billion fat cells. A typical overweight adult has around 75 billion fat cells. But in the case of severe obesity, this number can be as high as 250 to 300 billion!
The average size (weight) of an adult fat cell is about 0.6 micrograms, but they can vary in size from 0.2 micograms to 0.9 micrograms. An overweight person's fat cells can be up to three times larger than a person with ideal body composition.
Remember, body fat is basically just a reserve source of energy and fat cells are the like the storage tanks. Unlike a gas tank in your car which is fixed in size, however, fat cells can expand or shrink in size depending on how “filled” they are.
Picture a balloon that is not inflated: It's tiny when not filled with air – maybe the size of your thumb. When you blow it up with air, it can expand 10 or 12 times it's normal size, because it simply fills up. That's what happens to fat cells: They start as nearly empty fat storage “tanks” (when you are lean), and when energy intake exceeds your needs, your fat cells “fill up” and “stretch out” like balloons filling up with jelly (not a pretty picture, is it?)
So you don't actually “lose” fat cells, you “shrink” or “empty out” fat cells.
Take-home lessons:
1. Calories count!The signal that triggers your body to release adipose from fat cells is an energy deficit… you have to burn more than you eat.
2. Cut calories conservatively. Starving yourself may cause quick weightloss at first, but never works long term because it actually decreases the activity of fat burning enzymes that release fat from the cells. to avoid this “starvation mode” use exercise to BURN THE FAT, not very low calorie crash diets.
3. Get control of your weight now. If you are gaining weight, and especially if your weight is climbing upwards out of control, make a decision to STOP RIGHT NOW. Your fat cells might be multiplying, making it more difficult to burn fat in the future. NOW is the time!
4. If you've already lost weight, you must be forever diligent. Your fat cells are not gone, they have merely “shrunk” or “emptied out.” Fitness is not a 12 week program, its a lifestyle. To stay lean you have to eat clean and stay active
5. Genetics are only a minor factor. You may not have control over how many fat cells you were born with, but you do control the major factors that determine how much fat you store: lifestyle, exercise, nutrition, mental attitude.
Genetics are not an excuse. The past is not an excuse. Your present condition is not an excuse. You can either make excuses or get results, but you can't do both.
So keep educating yourself about the science, read these newsletters, take action every day and go out there and make it happen!

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's vow to battle President-elect Donald Trump “and his team of billionaires, bigots and Wall Street bankers” as she announced her re-election plans yesterday could trigger the vengeful Manhattan mogul's wrath in an ugly 2018 Bay State Senate race.
“(There's) an added incentive for the Trump administration, knowing how vehemently she worked against his election,” said state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the president-elect's Bay State campaign. “I'd expect him to get involved.”
Warren blasted Trump on Twitter and at press conferences throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, and is hoping to ride a likely anti-Trump backlash in Massachusetts all the way back to Washington in 2018.
But the brash billionaire has a long memory, almost always hits back and can be intensely motivated by vengeance. Some of Trump's closest supporters believe he decided to run for the White House after President Obama unrelentingly roasted him at the White House Correspondents' Dinner in 2011.
With Democrats already forced to defend 25 of the 33 open Senate seats in 2018 (including two independents who caucus with the Dems), Trump could make it his personal mission to take out the insult-hurling Warren at the polls.
Warren officially announced she's running for re-election, putting Republicans on notice to field their own challenger.
“(The) people of Massachusetts didn't send me to Washington to roll over and play dead while Donald Trump and his team of billionaires, bigots, and Wall Street bankers crush the working people of our Commonwealth and this country,” she wrote. “This is no time to quit.”
So far, the only possible big-name candidate is former Red Sox ace Curt Schilling, but more may surface in the next few months.
“There are several people who are legitimately looking at it,” said Massachusetts Republican National Committeeman Ron Kaufman, who declined to name them because he said he had been asked not to.
“I think she'll have a challenge from within the party and a challenge from our side. I think it'll be a spirited race,” he said.
Schilling, who has said he's considering a run, yesterday tweeted, “If I run we will kick her (expletive). Book it.”
But he declined a request for a formal interview. “She seems to be doing all right ruining herself every time she opens her mouth,” he told the Herald. “No need for me to help.”
Former Massachusetts Gov. William F. Weld, who ran for vice president last year on a ticket with Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, ruled out a 2018 Senate run yesterday.
“Not interested,” Weld wrote in an e-mail to the Herald asking if he planned to challenge Warren.
Both Diehl and former state Rep. and Judge Dan Winslow said they haven't ruled out runs themselves.
The early Republican playbook seems to be to cast Warren as too liberal even for Massachusetts.
“Whoever ends up running, … they will all be to the center of Warren,” said Kaufman. “Michael Dukakis would be to the center of Elizabeth Warren.”

MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A family in mourning Monday night.
Jenell Harris wants to know why someone would shoot her child.
"All I know is my baby was shot and killed, the reason why..."
Fifteen-year-old Vianca Harris was found dead on a couch in the Valley Forge Apartments in Whitehaven.
The Grandview Middle School student slept over at a family member's apartment with a friend from school.
Documents News Channel 3 obtained late Monday night say a witness inside the apartment told officers Terry Turner grabbed a12 gauge shotgun from the closet, loaded it and fired a shot at the teenager's head.
Turner told police Harris was "playing with the gun so he was trying to take it the gun away from the victim when the gun fired."
"She was here visiting, and they don't understand how she came to visit someone and ended up dead," said Star Williams, the teen's aunt.
Turner's no stranger to crime having been arrested last year for having a dozen stolen ID's.
Turner's gender is reported differently with each arrest.
When Turner was arrested last year, authorities reported placing Turner with female inmates, and then realized that was a mistake and moved Turner with the male inmates.
"Just make y'all know everybody your kids with," said Harris.
Her daughter was also about five weeks pregnant according to police.
Her mother said much of this she just didn't know.
"I lost my baby girl. That's my baby, my baby. My baby was 15-years-old."

The Roberts 5 on our Supreme Court, all Reagan and �W� Bush appointees, have, with the McCutcheon decision, taken us a big step closer to complete rule by the ultra-wealthy. That would be an �oligarchy.�
Sean McCutcheon is a wealthy coal company executive, who thought that �Citizens United� (unlimited corporate money to buy elections) wasn�t enough. So the 5 conservatives on the Supeme Court upped the aggregate limit that INDIVIDUALS can give from $48,600 to $3.6 million dollars. They can spend up to $2,600 dollars on as many candidates as they want, in all 50 states.
But I can�t write about this any better than E.J. Dionne Jr. did in these pages April 8th: �... Chief Justice John Roberts and his four allies always side with the wealthy, the powerful and the forces that would advance the political party that put them on the court. The ideological overreach that is wrecking our politics is also now wrecking our jurisprudence.�
In attempting to justify this furtherance of turning our government over to the very rich, Republicans must conveniently forget/ignore the impact on you and me. Two examples:
House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH): �What I think this means is that freedom of speech is being upheld.� An obvious LIE. He�s supporting the court�s �money equals speech� decision, where OUR speech is muted by big money.
Senate Minority Leader �Mitch� McConnell (R-KY) said the Supreme Court �Did recognize that it is the right of the individual, and not the prerogative of Congress, to determine how many candidates and parties to support.� Yeah right, and how many candidates can YOU AND I give $2,600 dollars to?
Decisions like these led to four Republican presidential hopefuls (Chris Christie, John Kasick, Scott Walker, Jeb Bush) going to Las Vegas recently to ask for money from casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson.
But the �poster boys� for destroying our democracy are Charles and David Koch who own Georgia Pacific, Koch Oil, and who make many products you find on store shelves.
Republican columnist Kathleen Parker in last Monday�s piece titled �Demonizing the Kochs,� said that they are only promoting �free-market principles� and �pursuing capitalist endeavors.� She said that Sen. Harry Reid should apologize for calling them �un-American.�
Hogwash. Like most of the few hundred members of the one-tenth percent, Charles and David Koch never have enough money and power. They�re using their billions to buy politicians and steal our democracy, with the blessings of the Roberts 5 on the Court. Their �free-market principles� include NO regulations, and plenty of land, air, and water pollution. Their �capitalist endeavors� are wild, unbridled capitalism, with plenty of advantages for them and none for the rest of us. The Koch brothers are definitely un-American, and as this year progresses, more of the middle class will come to know that. One survey says 48 percent already know who the Kochs are, and most of those don�t like �em.
Charles Koch, irritated that Sen. Harry Reid has started a campaign of publicizing the brothers� attacks on our democracy, wrote a piece in the April 2 Wall Street Journal. In it, he says he�s �devoted to the principles of a free society� and to �the fundamental concepts of dignity, respect, equality before the law and personal freedom.�
That�s more hogwash. He goes on to talk about wanting �to restore a free society and create greater well-being and opportunity for all Americans.�
These good and worthy ideals are the complete OPPOSITE of what the Kochs are doing. With their complex network of �dark money� organizations, they�ve spent $30 million that we know of, trying to win back the Senate. And please, don�t gripe about George Soros. With ultra-rich conservatives spending limitless money to silence our voices in Congress, Democrats have to depend on their own wealthy donors. Meanwhile, George Soros Junior has begun an expensive campaign to get money out of politics.
The unions are far outspent by the super-rich, who don�t have to report much of what they spend. All NLRB-regulated unions must make complete reports of campaign spending.
These people are CHANGING YOUR LIFE, �and not in a good way�. Call and tell them how angry you are about that. It�ll get their attention.

No matter who's currently occupying 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Michelle Obama will always and forever be my first lady. To me, she epitomises class, grace, strength, smarts, and slay... all while managing to walk the dogs, write college recommendation letters, end childhood obesity, deliver incredible (sometimes copied) speeches, and sit down for family dinner with Sasha, Malia, and President Barack Obama. Just call her Superwoman.
Her eight years in the White House were spent in style, too. She nailed every single campaign, rally, and State Dinner ensemble, never missing a beat, and managing to show love to international designers. And her longtime hairstylist, Johnny Wright, always made sure that her hair was laid, with the silkiest presses and the bounciest blowouts possible.
This is the picuture I have been waiting on for like 3 years. COME ON NATURAL. pic.twitter.com/HF8AYpsciB — gif sommelier (@meagnacarta) April 2, 2017
However, there's one style that the Michelle Hive longed to see that never happened: her natural hair. Wright confirmed that Mrs. Obama is 100 percent natural in 2014, and the Internet ran with it since then. I can't count how many times I saw this Photoshopped image of the former first lady with a huge, curly 'fro come across my timeline. Despite our hopes and wishes, Ms. Obama opted to straighten her hair throughout her time in the public eye. Until now.
Twitter user @meagnacarta posted a photo of the leader with a curly, voluminous low ponytail, and a wide, printed headband around her edges. It's not clear when or where it was taken, but it didn't take long for the rest of Twitter to collectively freak out. Meagnacarta's post racked up over 16,000 retweets, and prompted a whole lot of responses, too.
And with one photo, Natural Hair folks REJOICE like Sunday in CHURCH!! My #FLOTUS is working that puff! YAAASSS!!!! https://t.co/4hqvTxnehw — Scooter Phoenix (@ScooterPhoenix) April 3, 2017
I KNOW @MichelleObama WAS TIRED OF ALL THOSE SILK PRESSES!!! THANKFUL SHE CAN FINALLY FLOURISH WITH HER NATURAL HAIR❤❤💕💕💕 YOU DESERVE IT — K⭐️ (@BertFarlander) April 3, 2017
michelle obama's natural hair pic.twitter.com/7P6saWHqZF — Franklin Ocean (@nebulawade) April 3, 2017
But because this is the Internet, there were also people who thought that the Michelle ponytail was nbd. "Wow I can't believe Michelle Obama invented having natural hair," a user sarcastically tweeted. "Lol people really overdo it on Twitter," another noted.
Aside from the #unimpressed demo, there were also a few that dared to address the elephant in the room. "Boy if Michelle Obama would have ever worn her hair natural it would have been a fuckin debacle," a separate tweeter said. And he's got a point. Black women should be free to wear their hair however they choose in the workspace, but just look at what happened to Maxine Waters this week. And the U.S. court ruling that makes it legal to discriminate against employees with dreadlocks.
Maybe there is a reason why Mrs. Obama waited until she was OOO to let her natural hair fly... only she knows. But I know that it was worth the wait.
Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?

Alicia Keys Shut Down Adam Levine's Makeup-Shaming In The Best Way Possible
When an exciting prospect is about to make his MLB debut, it's natural for him to draw some far-fetched comparisons, and some that seem a bit more realistic. Analysts always want to compare up-and-comers to Hall of Fame players, but the Braves' number-one prospect draws a much more recent comparison.
The Atlanta Braves have something special in Ronald Acuña, and that's a fact. He's drawing comparisons to Andruw Jones and even Ken Griffey Jr. Acuña has left his mark at each minor league level, and he's currently wrecking Arizona Fall League pitching. The kid can't be contained, but it's time to make a comparison that no one wants to make.
Entering the 2010 season, Jason Heyward was baseball's top prospect, ahead of both Giancarlo Stanton and Stephen Strasburg. Heyward did everything right in the minor leagues, He was batting .300 or better anywhere he went, and at just 19-years-old, he had more than earned the right to be called a number-one prospect.
Before breaking onto the MLB scene, Heyward himself drew comparisons to Griffey, and rightfully so. However, don't think that this is the only thing that Jason Heyward and Ronald Acuña have in common. Their respective levels of play at 19-years-old were quite similar:
Acuña/Heyward stat comparison, presented without comment. pic.twitter.com/lb97bCG5dY — Peoria Javelinas Fan (@BravesTwills) November 2, 2017
Granted, Heyward only played three games in AAA, and didn't record a single extra-base hit there. Nonetheless, the numbers at 19 are very close, with Heyward actually having a slight edge with his high walk rate and lower strikeout rate.
The Comparison
Ronald Acuña won't ever match Heyward's 6'5″, 240lb frame, but what he has matched in terms of prospect value is his ability to crush baseballs and split gaps. You don't slug .500+ against guys much older than you for an entire year by accident, just as Heyward didn't accidentally walk just as often as he struck out.
The main difference between Heyward and Acuña at the minor league level is plate discipline. At 19, Acuña struck out twice as often as J-Hey, and walked at a lower rate. Other than these two non-contact stats, the two were extra-base hit machines, and Acuña swiped 44 bags to Heyward's 10.
Ronald Acuña has the lone tool that Heyward lacked as a prospect in his speed and ability to steal bases. Heyward wasn't slow, but his speed didn't play into great base-running like Acuña's has.
It's fair to say that, at 19-years-old, Ronald Acuña is a free-swinging, speedy version of Jason Heyward at 19.
What went wrong with Heyward?
Fans hear ‘Ronald Acuña' and ‘Jason Heyward' in the same breath and scoff, due to the nature of Heyward's MLB career. However, it cannot be assumed that what went wrong in his career will also go wrong with Acuña. In fact, the Atlanta Braves have already avoided one fault this time around.
Jason Heyward played three games at the AAA level before being called up to the MLB. Many people believe that AA experience is just as valuable as AAA experience, but we may be seeing that this isn't true via Heyward's MLB career.
In 2009, Jason Heyward was 5.6 years younger than the average AA hitter, and 8.3 years younger than the average AAA hitter. That's a relatively huge 2.7 year gap between the two levels. Hitters in AAA had, on average, 2.7 years more experience than AA hitters, and Heyward only played three games with those more experienced guys before being deemed ready for the MLB.
AAA experience is crucial to a player's development, especially at 19. This is the closest a prospect will get to facing MLB-level competition before actually having to do so. The Atlanta Braves seemingly realized this with Ronald Acuña, and made sure he got plenty of AAA time in 2017… never mind the prospect-laden Arizona Fall League.
Another thing that helped derail Jason Heyward's path to stardom was actually his size. Being 6'5″ works well for some, but it didn't work for Heyward. He's just too big for himself. His long arms created a long swing, and it's something he's still struggling to fix. This longer swing was okay against mediocre pitching in the minors, but not against the top-tier pitching of the MLB.
Standing at just 6'0″ is a blessing for Ronald Acuña. A smaller body and shorter arms will leave less room for error once he's up against the best of the best pitching, and he likely won't run into the mechanical issues that Heyward so unfortunately has.
A better Heyward?
While there's a laundry list of similarities between Heyward and Acuña at 19-years-old, it's important to know that the size and speed differences between the two will have drastic implications on their respective MLB careers.
Simply put, Ronald Acuña is just built better to be a true five-tool player in the MLB. Heyward may have been just as talented as Acuña, if not more talented, but his body hindered his ability to convert that talent into success.
Minor league stat comparisons between these two highly-touted Atlanta Braves prospects show how similar their skill sets are, but will be no indication of similarity between their big league careers.
Ronald Acuña will be a better Jason Heyward. Period.
Chelsea beats Milan at MetLife Stadium in New York to give them the pass to the final match against Real Madrid in Miami.
Mou Will Play his Former Blancos in Miami 1 1 Real Madrid awaited the winner between the Blues and the Rossoneri after los Blancos beat Everton FC in the semifinal. MetLife Stadium, the home of the New York Jets and the New York Giants, served as a host for the Guinness International Champions Cup other semifinal. Chelsea dominated the match and held a comfortable 1-0 lead throughout the whole game until André Schürrle widened the gap on stoppage time. The match had moments that felt like a casual friendly and moments of intensity that risked injury for players in both sides this pre-season.
There was practically no midfield play during the first half as the ball went from side to side, Chelsea held on defensively and counter-attacked while the Rossoneri casually looked to open up spaces. Despite being a friendly match, both teams were playing strong, though Milan players seemed to be showing-off instead of playing their usual tactical soccer. Chelsea in the other hand was playing a more serious match and it served them well after constant attacks on Abbiati's goal. First they disallowed a goal by De Bruyne since Demba Ba was offside. But minutes later Eden Hazard found a wide opened De Bruyne that with a low shot beat Abiatti and put Chelsea up on the scoreboard 1-0. Milan tried for a comeback in the first half, but to no avail as they went to the break in a deficit.
Jose Mourinho opted for making seven substitutions before the second half started, brining in a very different Chelsea team. The Blues dominated the second half completely and tested Abiatti's net constantly from every side. The Italian goalkeeper had numerous stops as his defense could not stop Chelsea at all, Milan was not causing any danger in front, despite losing by a goal. More substitutions came from both sides as both managers tested their squad in this pre-season friendly tournament. Milan had a couple of close calls on Chelsea's net that could have extended the game to penalty kicks but no goal ever came by the Rossoneri. Chelsea kept firing over and over on Abiatti's net to no avail until stoppage time when Schürrle placed it on the bottom right corner with a side volley. The Blues moved on to the final match against Real Madrid.
Jose Mourinho will play his former team in the final match of the Guinness Cup at Sun Life Stadium in Miami, Florida. Carlo Ancelotti also will be playing a team he formerly managed, he was with the Blues from 2009-2011 before heading to PSG. A very interesting match as the controversial Portugues manager will face Los Blancos now under the Italian's reign. Mourinho's recent comments on Ronaldo will even add more spice to the match, he probably also knows a secret or two on how to stop CR7. The final of the Guinness Cup sounds as appetizing as the new beer the sponsors are promoting, the Guinness Black Lager.
Abortions Occurring Earlier in Pregnancy
and Fewer Teens Obtaining Abortions
The rate of abortion in the United States is at its lowest level since 1974, having declined 33% from a peak of 29 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 in 1980 to 20 per 1,000 in 2004. However, this overall trend masks large disparities in rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion across demographic subgroups, according to Trends in the Characteristics of Women Obtaining Abortions, 1974 to 2004.
“The analysis found positive trends, but highlights several issues of concern,” said Sharon Camp, Guttmacher Institute president and CEO. “Many Americans will welcome the news that there are fewer abortions, particularly among teens, and that a larger proportion of abortions are now happening very early in pregnancy. But at the same time, abortions are becoming more concentrated among women of color and low-income women. This presents a clear challenge to policymakers to redouble their efforts to improve access to subsidized contraceptive services for these women, thereby helping them to prevent the unintended pregnancies behind these abortions from occurring in the first place.”
Although abortion rates have declined among all racial and ethnic groups, large disparities persist, with Hispanic and black women obtaining abortions at rates three and five times higher, respectively, than non-Hispanic white women. Between 1994 and 2004, the abortion rate for Hispanic women fell by 20%, from 35 to 28 per 1,000 women aged 15–44. This was less than the 30% decline among non-Hispanic white women (from 15 to 11 per 1,000), but more than the 15% decline among black women (from 59 to 50 per 1,000). These widely varying rates reflect disparities in unintended pregnancy, as well as in access to the most effective contraceptive methods.
“Behind virtually every abortion is an unintended pregnancy. And because women of color are much more likely to experience unintended pregnancies than any other group, they are also more likely to seek and obtain abortions,” said Rachel Jones, Guttmacher Institute senior research associate. “Previous Guttmacher research has found that unintended pregnancy and abortion rates are also increasing among poor and low-income women. Policymakers at the state and federal levels should be asking themselves what can be done to help poor women and women of color prevent unintended pregnancies and achieve better health outcomes more generally.”
The study also looked at trends in abortion by various other characteristics, including age, gestation and motherhood. As compared with 1973, the typical woman obtaining an abortion today is older, more likely to have children, less likely to be married and more likely to be nonwhite. Prior Guttmacher research has also documented that most women obtaining abortions are poor or low-income. Among the report's key findings:
Age: Over the past three decades, the proportion of abortions obtained by teens has dropped steadily, from 33% in 1974 to 25% in 1989 to 17% in 2004. In 2004, more than half of all abortions (57%) were obtained by women in their twenties. Teen abortion rates have also declined—by more than 50%—from 42 per 1,000 women aged 15¬–19 in 1989 to 20 in 2004. A large part of the decline in abortion among teens—which began long before abstinence-only sex education programs began receiving federal funding—is attributable to increased use of contraceptives and use of more effective methods.

Gestation: Overall, trends in second-trimester abortions (those occurring after 12 weeks) have changed little, notwithstanding improved technology and increasing state restrictions. The majority (89%) of U.S. abortions occur during the first trimester, and the proportion of very early abortions (those at seven weeks or earlier, when the procedure is safest) has increased substantially, from 16% in 1994 to 28% in 2004. The continuing shift to earlier abortions most likely reflects increased availability and use of home pregnancy detection kits, greater availability of early surgical procedures and increasing use of medication abortion.

The continuing shift to earlier abortions most likely reflects increased availability and use of home pregnancy detection kits, greater availability of early surgical procedures and increasing use of medication abortion. Motherhood: In 2004, 60% of women having abortions already had children, up from 50% in 1989 and 46% in 1974. Part of the reason for this shift is that fewer teenagers and young women are having abortions than did in previous years. Previous Guttmacher analysis has found that women who are already mothers cite responsibility for their children and families as one of the primary reasons for obtaining an abortion.
Trends in the Characteristics of Women Obtaining Abortions, 1974 to 2004, by Stanley Henshaw and Kathryn Kost, also includes detailed state tables, including trends in the number and rate of abortions by state of occurrence and state of residence, and trends in the number of abortion providers by state.

Story Highlights Half of the public thinks now is a good time to find a quality job
Gap between Republicans and Democrats has closed to within 11 points
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Americans' optimism about the availability of good jobs in the U.S. surged in January to its highest level in more than 15 years of Gallup polling on the subject. Fifty percent say now is a good time to find a quality job, up seven percentage points from December and two points above the previous high recorded in January 2007.
The previous high of 48% in January 2007 was followed by a three-year slide during the recession, to the point that only 9% in January 2010 thought it was a good time to find a quality job. The annual average grew each year from 10% in 2009 to 42% in 2015 and remained at that level in 2016.
As Election Neared, Politics Played a Big Part in Views on Good Jobs
While 55% of Democrats say now is a good time to find a quality job, 44% of Republicans say the same -- an 11-point gap. This gap is much smaller than it was during the presidential campaign last year, which had a major impact on views about the availability of good jobs.
Members of the party holding the presidency tend to be more positive about the economy than are those of the opposition party, and the gap can grow in the heat of a presidential campaign. At the start of 2016, there was a 19-point gap in Democrats' vs. Republicans' perceptions that it was a good time to get a quality job (54% vs. 35%, respectively). This swelled to 38 points by October, when 62% of Democrats said it was a good time, compared with 24% of Republicans. Now, with the campaign over, the gap has shrunk.
Gallup has documented similar party shifts in economic confidence since the election.
Key Groups With High Unemployment Rates Think Good Jobs Are Available
Among the more likely to say now is a good time to find a quality job are those in a good position regarding employment:
Sixty-two percent of those with a postgraduate education say now is a good time to find a quality job.
Fifty-seven percent of those with an annual household income of $75,000 or more say it is a good time.
Fifty-six percent of those who are employed say it is a good time.
However, some key groups with higher-than-average unemployment rates also are among the more positive about finding good jobs:
Fifty-seven percent of nonwhites say now is a good time, compared with 47% of whites, though nonwhites are more likely to be unemployed.
Fifty-four percent of those younger than 35 versus 48% of those aged 35 and older think it is a good time, though the younger group is more likely to be unemployed.
Fifty-four percent of men say now is a good time to find a quality job, compared with 46% of women, though the unemployment rate is slightly higher for men.
Bottom Line
Americans have entered the new year relatively optimistic about the chances for job seekers to find quality employment. With the election behind them but Donald Trump not yet inaugurated, Republicans are more optimistic as they look forward to a Republican president taking office -- while Democrats are generally positive based on their belief that the Obama presidency has been good for the economy.
Political attitudes can be expected to have their usual effect over the next year on views about how easy it is to find a good job. Once Trump takes office, Democrats may develop a more negative view of the job market while Republicans' outlook improves even more. But the unemployment rate is a powerful driver of American views on the subject, and that is unlikely to change much in the next few months.
Historical data are available in Gallup Analytics.

I'll describe in a different context why and how ART is a good fit in our revamp of OpenBSD network stack. For the moment, let's have a look at the single-thread performances of this algorithm in OpenBSD -current.
The principal motivation for adopting a new tree implementation can be explained in three letters: SMP.
ART has been the default routing table backend in OpenBSD for some months now. That means that OpenBSD 6.0 will no longer consult the 4.3 BSD reduced radix tree to perform route lookups.
Performances
ART is a free multibit trie based routing table. To keep it simple, it can be seen as using more memory for fewer CPU cycles. In other words, we get a faster lookup by wasting memory. The original paper presents some performance comparisons between two ART configurations and the BSD Radix. But how does this apply to OpenBSD?
I asked Hrvoje Popovski to run his packet forwarding test on his Xeon box (E5-2620 v2 @ 2.10GHz, 2400.34 MHz) with ix(4) (82599) interfaces. The test setup consist of three machines with the OpenBSD box in the middle:
The machine is configured with:
kern.pool_debug=0 kern.maxclusters=32768 net.inet.ip.forwarding=1 net.inet.ip.ifq.maxlen=8192
The simulations have been performed with an OpenBSD -current from June 9th. The machine is configured with pf(4) disabled in order to force a single route lookup for every IPv4 packet. Based on the result of the lookup the kernel decide if it should forward, deliver or drop the packet:
In order to measure the impact of a different routing table configurations we need to send enough packets to make sure the machine is CPU bound but not live locked. In this case it happens when sending 800 Kpps. During a test the sender generates packets for all addresses of a given subnet to invalidate any possible cache. Plus to see the difference of various subnets, the test has been reproduced on a /24, a /20 and a /16:
ART 8/4/4/4/4/4/4 is the configuration currently enabled in -current. It has been choosen because it has a memory footprint similar to the BSD Radix for a fullfeed BGP server. The other configurations waste more memory by using bigger stride lengths but, as shown on the graphic, perform faster.
Memory consumption
Sadly this test is not enough to see how much memory can be wasted by different ART configurations because it does not create fragmentation:
So I asked benno@ and phessler@ if I could measure once again the memory consumption of a BGP fullfeed on their test setup:
We can see that using bigger stride lengths result in more memory being wasted.
Conclusion
As expected ART performs faster than the BSD Radix on OpenBSD because it uses more memory. That's hopefully not new to me, so what did I learn during these experiments?
First of all I validated the choice I made two years ago to integrate an implementation supporting variable stride lengths. It is nice to be able to choose at compile time, depending on your usage, how much memory you want to dedicate to improve your route lookup performances. This is important for experimenting but it also matches the fact OpenBSD is a generic purpose operating system and its users have different requirements.
Secondly I've seen that the 8/8/8/8 configuration doesn't offer any advantage compared to the 16/8/8 one. The only problem is that it doesn't seem to be currently possible to allocate the 16-heap in a MP-safe way on OpenBSD, something to look at in the future?
Finally the in-kernel memory consumed by the routing table of a BGP server is around 130M in -current and would grow to 180M with a 16/8/8 configuration. Even if route lookup performances are not critical for such setups, I'd argue that consuming 180M is already acceptable today, in case we decide to crank the defaults in the upcoming years.
Hello!
My name is Kim Bjørn and welcome to the PUSH TURN MOVE Kickstarter!
Like many, I have always been passionate about music technology. Two years ago I got the idea to combine my interest for design with my love of gear into an elegant, up-to-date book about electronic music instruments.
PUSH TURN MOVE shows all kinds of gear but the ambition goes further: It provides a categorization of equipment and software while exploring the functional and artistic world of electronic interfaces in the context of making music.
Initially, the book was born out of my own passion. But it has transformed into a multi-voiced project since it contains more than 25 interviews with innovative designers, artists and brands who conceive or use these great music making tools.
Quite unique for PUSH TURN MOVE is that brands who might usually be considered competitors have joined the book side by side to share their knowledge about gear for making electronic music.
So what exactly is PUSH TURN MOVE? Watch the video, take the tour below and please support the book by selecting a reward if you like the idea. The book will be sent out in September.

EU scientists say Volcanoes, Asteroids are unimaginably worse than climate change
Experts say that climate change is the worst threat we face, except for the worse ones.
Experts at the European Science Foundation said volcanoes – especially super-volcanoes like the one at Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, which has a caldera measuring 34 by 45 miles (55 by 72 km) – pose more threat to Earth and the survival of humans than asteroids, earthquakes, nuclear war and global warming.
What could be worse than 1.5 degrees of warming?
[After] … a major eruption, the team said, millions of people would die and earth's atmosphere would be poisoned with ash and other toxins “beyond the imagination of anything man's activity and global warming could do over 1,000 years.
We are talking about an “extinction-level event”:

But the UN and Obama will save us right?
There are few real contingency plans in place to deal with the ticking time bomb, which they conclude is likely to go off within the next 80 years.
40,000 people met in Paris last month to solve the greatest threat to Life On Earth.
The chance of such as eruption happening at one of the major volcanoes within 80 years is put at five to ten per cent by the experts.
Looks like there's a 90% consensus that we don't have to do anything?
The report makes for interesting reading (perfect for disaster-nerds, and catastrophe-spotters). This is not just about supervolcanoes, but asteroids, Spanish flu, and Ebola too.
X-events differ in terms of the disasters they

Their first conversation dealt with truth and the nature of reality, with Einstein wondering if truth and beauty existed independently of man. ''If there would be no human beings any more,'' Einstein offered as a hypothesis, ''the Apollo of Belvedere would no longer be beautiful.''
When Tagore objected to that premise, Einstein said that he agreed with it in terms of Beauty, but not Truth. Tagore said that Truth was realized through man: ''If there be some Truth which has no sensuous or rational relation to the human mind, it will ever remain as nothing so long as we remain human beings.'' To which Einstein responded, ''Then I am more religious than you are!''
They met again in Berlin the next month -- the second of four meetings between 1930 and 1931. The men were photographed together, both hirsute -- Einstein with his moustache, Tagore with his long white beard -- hands identically clasped and each staring into the camera.

In that conversation, the two talked about family, the German youth movement and the interplay of chance and predetermination. That led to a discussion about the differences between Western and Indian classical music. Tagore commented that in human affairs there is ''an element of elasticity -- some freedom within a small range which is for the expression of our personality.'' He compared that freedom to Indian music, saying that it is not as rigidly fixed as Western music, and added that ''in India the measure of a singer's freedom is in his own creative personality -- he can make permutations and combinations of notes according to the law of the melody prescribed,'' but he had to be guided by his artistic conscience.
Veering from any attempt at criticism, both agreed that the beauty of a piece of music is beyond analysis. ''It is so difficult to analyze the effect of Eastern and Western music on our minds,'' Tagore said. ''I feel deeply moved by Western music . . . that it is vast in its structure and grand in its composition. Our own music touches me more deeply by its fundamental lyrical appeal. European music is epic in character; it has a broad background and is gothic in its structure.''
Einstein responded, ''We want to know whether our music is a conventional or fundamental human feeling, whether to feel consonance and dissonance is natural or is it a convention which we accept.''
He continued: ''The same uncertainty will always be there about everything fundamental in our experience, in our reaction to art, whether in Europe or Asia. Even the red flower I see before me on your table may not be the same to you and me.''
Tagore neither agreed nor disagreed but sought a position of compromise between East and West. ''And yet,'' he said, ''there is always going on the process of reconciliation between them, the individual taste conforming to the universal standard.''
In her introduction to the dialogues, Wendy Singer says that the have been narrowly interpreted as an example of an East-West confrontation, a scientific debate, or a philosophical commentary on the nature of Truth. But she emphasizes that Tagore and Einstein also ''functioned in a world of international scholars who sought out one another across national boundaries and disciplines to share their thoughts about the contemporary world.'' In that context, they developed a personal relationship even before they met, through their correspondence.

As Tagore wrote in a postcard to Einstein dated Dec. 22, 1929, ''My salutation is to him who knows me imperfect and loves me.''
The city has given Fashion Week its cat-walking papers from Lincoln Center.
The de Blasio administration folded like a cheap suit — settling a lawsuit filed by parks advocates that demanded the star-studded extravaganza leave the Upper West Side venue because it encroaches on a small park nearby.
“IMG Fashion Week shall vacate the premises and remove all tents and other Fashion Week equipment from the park,” according to the settlement, signed by New York Supreme Court Justice Margaret Chan on Tuesday.
Fashion Week — which generates an estimated $865 million for the city annually — was supposed to stay at Lincoln Center until 2020, when it would have a permanent home at Hudson Yards.
Now, its last show at Lincoln Center will be in February.
Organizers are eyeing event spaces downtown — which fashionistas say could strip away the glitz.
“You can't top those gorgeous street-style photos of well-heeled women in front of the fountain in Lincoln Center,” said Harper's Bazaar editor Joyann King.
She added, “It's such a landmark of the city . . . Lincoln Center had an elegance about it. There will be a little bit of that lost.”
Meghan Manning, a 22-year-old dancer who performs at Lincoln Center added, “I liked having it here. It's iconic.”
NYC Parks Advocates and other green-space boosters sued the city Parks Department in 2013 for misusing Damrosch Park, which is adjacent to Lincoln Center.
The settlement requires the city to add more trees and to hang a sign proclaiming that the space is a public park.
“Damrosch Park belongs to the city of New York not Lincoln Center,” Geoffrey Croft of NYC Park Advocates posted on his blog, A Walk in The Park.
Some neighbors also cheered the terms of the settlement.
“We are thrilled at the current settlement and that the park will be rebuilt,” said Cleo Dana, the chair of Friends of Damrosch Park, a plaintiff in the lawsuit.
A Fashion Week spokesman said the venue was good while it lasted.
“Lincoln Center has been a great home . . . However, as the fashion industry continues to evolve, IMG has been actively looking for a new home hat gives our designers and partners the best possible environment to share their creative visions,” a Fashion Week spokesman said.

On Tuesday, the Internet wept as the dual beacons of #RelationshipGoals, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, announced their split. The pair, who have been married for 10 years, gave a statement to People:
"After much thought and careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to divorce. We go forward with love and friendship for one another and a commitment to co-parenting our children, whose privacy we ask to be respected during this difficult time. This will be our only comment on this private, family matter. Thank you for understanding."
The result: total Internet meltdown.
Why is everyone freaking out so much? Amid the sea of Hollywood romances, you'd be hard-pressed to find a couple more open and honest about their love — and the work it took. Nowhere was that more apparent than in Affleck's emotional speech at the 2013 Oscars after winning Best Picture for Argo, in which he called out to his wife from the stage:
"I want to thank you for working on our marriage for 10 Christmases. It's good, it is work, but it's the best kind of work, and there's no one I'd rather work with."
Earnest and honest: Affleck and Garner actually faced backlash over the speech, with speculation that their marriage was in dire straits. But as Garner told the Telegraph, "I think [Ben] was saying, 'Look, what we have is really real and I value it above all and I'm in it with you and I know you are in it with me.' That's the way I took it."
Because that's how Garner and Affleck always acted — real. (For evidence, feel free to refer here, here, here, and here.)
Who can't relate to the idea that a long-term relationship isn't 100% easy, 100% of the time? By foregoing the typical sappy, awww-inducing, made-for-TV fare that we're accustomed to from star couples, Ben used this major career moment to honor his wife and marriage in perhaps the best way possible: by keeping it real and being upfront about the challenges of marriage.
And a far as celebrity #RelationshipGoals go, that's one of the best examples we've ever had.
And it still is — even though they're divorcing. It's tempting to lament the demise of Ben and Jen's marriage as the Death of Love, but in fact it's yet another example of the couple's no-bullshit approach to relationships. They're not easy, and they don't always work out, and that ultimately has to be OK (even if you have 10 Christmases under your belt).
A divorce isn't reason to dethrone Affleck and Garner as #RelationshipGoals royalty. Even in divorce, they embody the kind of honesty we should all strive for.
About this mod A remake of the basic Citadels (2000) card game using custom art. Permissions and credits Author's instructions I do not mind people to redistribute this/these files but I do not want other people passing it off as their own work.

Donation Points system This mod is not opted-in to receive Donation Points
In Citadels, players take on new roles each round to represent characters they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings. The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.
Players start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.
On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.

An Iranian rumor has conned the internet into believing that ISIS banned the burqa at security checkpoints in Mosul, Iraq after attacks on militants by veiled women.
The claim proliferated everywhere from the International Business Times to Britain's Daily Mail to the U.S. News and World Report and even Foreign Policy over the last few days, seldom mentioning the source of the speculation and often combined with a sputtering caveat that the terrorist group still requires mesh over eyes and gloves to keep hands covered.
Enshrining a strict dress code for women was one of the first things ISIS did after taking over cities. Women were instructed to wear loose-fitting black abayas over their bodies, gloves to hide their hands, and niqabs with an extra layer of mesh to obscure their eyes, or risk getting dragged in by the morality police.
But there's no hard proof that the terrorist group has backtracked even somewhat on its mandate for extreme coverage for women. And the burqa—a sack-like garment with a mesh eye covering common in Afghanistan—has never been pushed by ISIS or popular in Iraq, despite the pale blue-clad Afghan women accompanying some articles. In fact, it seems that the entire tale originated with Iranian state media, in an attempt to make ISIS look weak, less pious, or to capitalize on the burqini panic sweeping Europe.
Iran Front Page reported on September 4 that a source from Nineveh, Iraq told the Iranian-owned Arabic-language Al Alam News Network that the militant group banned niqab and burqa-clad women from security centers. It noted that the change came after "some fully veiled women killed a number of ISIS commanders and members in the past months." Iran's Western-focused propaganda outfit, PressTV, followed up with a similar story on September 5. It noted the hypocrisy of the terrorist group having killed insufficiently-veiled women before. Both articles mentioned that the alleged ban comes amid the controversy over the burqini in France.
Rumors of the ban all track back to an Iranian source and subsequent articles brought little skepticism. (IraqiNews.com mentioned that a veiled woman killed two fighters in Sharqat, but just said the terrorist group asked fighters to be more alert.) Some even refer to the all-female Al Khansaa morality police force in Raqqa as ISIS's “female fighters”—they're not—rather than a group that performs functions that men, for modesty reasons, cannot.
Rasha Al Aqeedi, a Mosul native and research fellow at the Al Mesbar Studies and Research Center in Dubai, said the Tehran connection immediately raised a red flag.
“I'm thinking, why would anyone in Mosul contact an Iranian agency,” she told The Daily Beast.
Still, claims about ISIS-held territories are understandably hard to fact-check. Citizen journalists and activists can face death for communicating with the outside world, let alone with rejectors like Shia Muslims in Tehran. The difficulty is doubled in Mosul, where ISIS cut off internet access this summer and where all online communications must take place in internet cafes.
Al Aqeedi checked in with a friend in Mosul, operating under strict precautions to avoid attracting ISIS scrutiny.
“We have to be very very careful about how we communicate,” she said. “It's a coded language kind of thing.”
The friend told her the ban was bullshit.
“She said, ‘I see you through a very tiny plate,'” Al Aqeedi said, the metaphor referring to the mesh netting ISIS requires women to wear over their eyes. “It's an all-women cafe, and still she has to have it [the niqab] on.”
No one in Mosul wears the garment properly termed as the burqa, Al Aqeedi said. Even the niqab, a full-face covering that leaves a slit for the woman's eyes, had only recently gained a limited popularity, she said. (It has increasingly supplanted traditional head coverings in Muslim communities worldwide thanks in part to Saudi Arabia's export of Wahhabi Islam.
“The Afghani thing, no one ever wore that,” Al Aqeedi said.
There have been periodic rumors of men dressed in niqabs attacking militants, she added, though they have never been confirmed. An ISIS attacker, however, used the same tactic to attack a Shia mosque in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, dressing as a woman and killing two men who confronted him outside the mosque.
The Iranian rumor said the change was in response to attacks on militants, but in ISIS's twisted apocalyptic theology, death on the front lines of the Islamic State is something to be welcomed, despite widespread internet rumors that the militants believe those killed by women don't go to heaven. "They love death more than your love of life," the group reminded the West in its new magazine, Rumiyah, or “Rome,” released this weekend.
Zeynab Mousavi has found fame in country where standup comedy is relatively new and where being a female performer is frowned upon
As a 28-year-old woman born and raised in the holy city of Qom – the Vatican of Iran's Shia Islam – Zeynab Mousavi is breaking numerous barriers to become the country's first female standup comic to find fame, and notoriety, on a national scale.
Mousavi has found legions of young fans, but has also touched a nerve in a country where standup comedy is relatively new, and being a female performer remains taboo for many.
“Being a female standup comedian in Iran is like competing in a swimming competition whilst you are three metres behind the starting line and your hands and legs are tied,” she told the Guardian, referring to a comparison one of her fellow comics has made.
“Considering Iranian cultural and social norms, doing standup here is by itself really difficult, and doing it as a female comedian is even harder,” she added.
Mousavi was the anonymous woman behind the Instagram character of Empress Kuzcooo, an internet sensation who wears an exaggerated hijab showing only her nose to deliver video sermons in front of an open wardrobe.
Her real identity – she is a recent computer software graduate – was a mystery until Iranian state television asked viewers to send videos of themselves to enter a standup competition. Mousavi sent one of her own, was selected to perform on national TV, and instantly became a hit among Iran's internet-savvy youth, but notorious among its hardliners.
Iran's restrictive political atmosphere has long given satire a function beyond simple entertainment. Standup comedy, however, is a genre only introduced recently thanks to a popular state TV programme called Khandevaneh, which gives comedians like Mousavi a platform.
“The reaction was incredible,” said Mousavi of her performance on Khandevaneh. “People were first talking about seeing the face of Empress Kuzcooo... [and] my first performance created a wave of comments that women can also be successful comedians.”
State television, where censorship is rife, is pushing boundaries to appeal to dwindling viewers who have increasingly turned to illegal satellite channels. And Mousavi has not shied away from controversial subjects.
In one of her performances, Mousavi jokes that “people are naming their kids after all sorts of things, and in a few years it's not strange to name your kid after Barjam”, referring to the Persian acronym for the landmark nuclear agreement reached between Iran and the west in 2015.
“But [it's ironic because] Barjam means Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. How can you name a child Barjam, when the child is the result of join comprehensive efforts without any plan for action.”
For Iranian television, erotic jokes – even subtle ones – are unprecedented.
It's for material like this that Mousavi has received threats. She recently complained in a video interview aired on Aparat, Iran's version of YouTube, that “these are bitter times for me, because I get threats to be attacked by acid, or they want to run me over , or do harm to me, I get sworn at... I'm under pressure.”
But she insists she will carry on making her fans laugh. The latest Empress Kuzcooo video is about the recent Fifa world cup draw, in which Iran was drawn in a group with football giants Spain and Portugal. She decries it as an “American conspiracy”, spearheaded by Cafu, the famous former Brazilian player who picked Iran in the group.
“This was American's work. Saudi Arabia is in an easy group,” the empress says.
Mousavi since has performed as herself in Milad tower, one of Tehran's most glamorous venues, and is due to tour Iranian provinces from next month.
“The most difficult thing is to go on stage and tell viewers that I'm not [performing as] a woman, nor an Iranian, nor a Muslim, I'm not even pretty, nothing. I'm just a comedian, just watch my comedy,” she said.
“I believe in something, that there's no pride in being oppressed. I won't hide myself behind the fact that things are difficult for us [women] and that we can't do a lot of things. Still you can do a lot – you can even be spectacular.”
Deadly shootout between Redwood City police, suspect outside bank Copyright by KRON - All rights reserved Video
REDWOOD CITY (KRON)--Redwood City police are investigating a deadly officer-involved shooting that happened Saturday afternoon.
According to the Redwood City Police Department, the incident happened just before 4 p.m. near a Wells Fargo bank in the 1900 block of Broadway.
Witnesses told KRON4's Spencer Blake, that the suspect was pacing around with a gun.
Spencer spoke with one bystander, Ignacio Jimenez, who captured video of the aftermath.
Jimenez said he was parking his car when he saw police cars zip by.
"That's when I saw officers behind the suburban with their weapons drawn," he said. "They were hiding behind the trees right across the street where there's a park, and so I saw that their attention was on a gentleman that was right outside the Wells Fargo bank."
Jimenez said it seemed like the suspect wasn't complying with the officers' orders.
"He had his hands in his pockets in his sweater and then soon after that he took his hand out, and he had something in his hand and shots rang out," he said.
Jimenez isn't sure who fired first. Police say the suspect shot at officers, who returned fire and killed him.
The suspect was in his 30s and police had multiple interactions with him in the past, authorities said.
Terrified commuters were caught up in a “dangerous” rush-hour crush at one of London's busiest stations after a man was brutally attacked by a gang.
Scenes of chaos hit Stratford station as staff struggled to marshal panicking crowds blocked from reaching overground platforms as they poured off the Jubilee line.
Witnesses said a child was “trampled” amid the jostling and confusion yesterday evening, with another passenger branding the situation “ridiculously chaotic”.
Problems began after 5pm when a man was attacked and collapsed unconscious with serious head injuries in the western underground walkway that links the overground rail platforms to the Westfield shopping centre and Jubilee line.
Transport for London today defended its decision not to close the station, saying staff believed that it was better to keep trains running to help disperse the crowds.
But witness Nick Paget, 28, a parliamentary researcher for Labour MP Gloria De Piero, told the Standard: “No one was in control. It was an accident waiting to happen. It was only luck that it didn't. Everyone streamed off the Tube lines but they couldn't get anywhere.”
"It was really unsafe for everyone in the station."
Peggy Loo, 33, an accountant from Stratford, said: “Nobody seemed to be trying to control the situation or realised how overcrowded it was. The attendants looked completely overwhelmed and it was really unsafe for everyone in the station.”
Peter Coleman, 64, a poppy seller on the platform, said: “It was mayhem. They shut the tunnel off, then people were trying to get over to the other side where the other tunnel to the platforms are. There were thousands of people.”
Jesus Manso Arcas, 32, a food importer who lives in Stratford, said: “We all started to fear for our safety and that people were going to get hurt, because people started pushing each other and if it had gone on much longer I think there could have been casualties. It was mayhem. They should have a better system for dealing with these things.”
Melissa Simpson, 25, a journalist, said: “It was horrible. I get claustrophobic and it was jammed with people. They should have just evacuated the station.”
Miles Tudor said: “I travel through Stratford daily and fear a serious incident is looming involving the crowded platforms. Last night there should have been a full halt on the trains and Tubes arriving, it felt quite out of control.”
Witnesses told the Standard that the injured man, named today by police as John Francis Breen, a 53-year-old Londoner, suffered a “brutal beating” on the London Overground platforms 1 and 2 and may have suffered further injuries falling down the stairs to the walkway before suffering a cardiac arrest.
The assailants are believed to have fled to the Jubilee line.
Prafal Thakrar, 51, who works in Expresso Coffee, said: “It was a gang of four people who attacked the person.
“It started in the West tunnel at platforms 1 and 2 and the [assailants] then legged it onto platform 13.
“Everyone started dialling 999 and they had to stop the train and they closed the platform so they couldn't run off.”
Police closed the walkway to allow paramedics and a doctor from London's Air Ambulance to give emergency treatment, while detectives sealed off the scene of the assault to begin an investigation.
Mr Breen was today in a “critical but stable” condition in hospital. Two 14-year-old boys, a 15-year-old boy and a 16-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and are in custody.
Detective Chief Inspector Dave Shipperlee, of British Transport Police, said: “If you know Mr Breen we need to hear from you. We also want to hear from any witnesses who may have been at the station and would urge anyone who saw anything to get in touch.”
He added: “During the initial stages of the investigation it was necessary to cordon off parts of Stratford station. We are aware there were a significant number of people who were unable to access certain sections of the station and we worked closely with the train operating companies to return the area to normal operations as soon as was possible.”
Steve Griffiths, chief operating officer for London Underground, said: “We appreciate our customer's patience during the police incident at Stratford yesterday evening.
“Our station staff worked hard to keep the station open in order to allow people to leave the area. We monitor such incidents carefully and our priority always remains the safety of our customers.”
Witnesses should contact BTP on 0800 40 50 40.
Irish Socialism: You have two cows. They don't get along. They each claim their milk is the best in the country. But neither of them has ever produced any milk.
Irish Capitalism: You have two cows. You eat both. You ask the EU to lend you two more cows. You again eat both. The EU calls you to ask why you've not fulfilled your milk quota. You stall them and ask the IMF for two more cows. Once again, you eat both. The EU and the IMF then come to Dublin looking for their milk. You're out shopping at a Bulgarian Property Expo.
Irish Libertarianism: You have two cows. You demand that everyone else be issued with two cows. But only after you've sold one cow, bought a bull, increased your herd and got a Government contract to supply cows.
Fine Gael: You have two cows. You sell one cow and force the other cow to produce the milk of four cows. Later, you commission an enquiry into the cow's death.
Fianna Fáil: You have two cows. You kill them. You get two more cows and promise this time it will be better. You kill them, again.
Sinn Féin: You have two cows. You'd like to grow your herd, but nobody will sell you a bull.
The Social Democrats: You have two cows. You used to have three.
The Labour Party: You have two cows. You gave them to Fine Gael in 2011. Five years later, you asked for them back. They don't respond to your request. You ask the public for two new cows. They don't respond to your request.
AAA/PBP: You have two cows. You give them to the party and then demand the Government give you two more.
The Green Party: You have two cows. You love them.
Neoliberalism: You have two cows. They are very attractive but their milk is conservative and bland.
Simon Coveney: You have two cows. You sell three of them to Greencore. You then execute a debt for equity swap, ensuring you the rights to four cows.
You then sell the milking rights of five cows via an intermediary to a holding company based in Luxembourg, who then issue you a deed for six cows.
Your annual report says you own seven cows, with the option of two more.
Meanwhile, your two cows are living in emergency accommodation.
Gerry Adams: You have two cows. No one buys your milk. But that's not the substantive issue…
Catherine Murphy: You have two cows. If it wasn't for Dáil privilege no one would have known how they'd been treated.
Brendan Howlin: You have two cows. You decreased their feed and demand they produce more milk. One dies and the other emigrates and is forced to work as a horse. You blame socialism.
Paul Murphy: You have two cows. You organise a sit down protest, block all the roads and demand you get three cows over a megaphone.
Micheál Martin: You have two cows. You eat one and milk the other. You then throw the milk away, because Paul Murphy got elected on a promise to be lactose intolerant.
Enda Kenny: You have two cows. Forty-two years later you discover one of them is a donkey.

Overzealous officials down under
From the library of the Baron; which smells, oddly, of baseball glove oil.
My Honorable Bruegalites,
My Mischief Makers have been toying and teasing you with mentions of Big Revelations coming soon. I asked them not to, but they tend to do whatever brings a smile to their faces.

The northernmost city in Sweden, Kiruna, was back in the news this week with reports that it would be moving — yes, moving — about two miles east. And, for once, an unusual story from the Arctic Circle had nothing to do with climate change.
Why would a town need to move?
Kiruna's plan to move has been in the works for a few years now. The city, comfortably within the borders of the Arctic Circle and home to a little more than 18,000 people, is built on a hill above a vast iron ore mine. Founded in 1900 and midwifed by a state-owned mining company, Kiruna has been an industry town for over a century.
Now that industry is simultaneously endangering the city and paying for its relocation. As the mine on Kiruna's western border has expanded deeper into the ground, ore is being removed from beneath the city's foundations — literally undermining the ground it sits on.
Pfizer's bid to purchase AstraZeneca failed, but the company's attempt to move to London in an effort to avoid US corporate taxes has inspired a new round of commentary on America's corporate tax system. Perhaps it should also spur a look at America's commitment to raising drug prices around the world.
The US taxes the global income of its companies, which has led many of the largest to keep profits overseas indefinitely to avoid paying Uncle Sam, and even shift US profits overseas to avoid public levies. So-called “inversions”—reverse mergers where a US company buys a foreign one and assumes their jurisdiction, as Pfizer proposed—have also become more popular. Four US pharmaceutical companies have used the tactic to go overseas in the last year, and four more are considering similar moves.
While some US lawmakers have proposed a deal that would (paywall) block inversions as part of a strategy to lower taxes—a corporate practice that forecasters say would otherwise cost the US $20 billion in lost tax revenue over the next decade—many multinational companies argue that the US should simply end taxation of overseas income. Gary Hufbaeur, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, lays out their argument:
[Multi-national companies] must incur huge research and development (R&D) costs and other investment outlays to stay competitive. To recover these costs and earn a decent profit, they must produce and sell in world markets. As part of their growth strategies, many countries—not just Ireland and Switzerland, but also India and China—tailor their tax laws to attract MNC factories, service centers, and research facilities.
It's worth noting off the bat that those R&D investments are typically written off the tax bill—while the US R&D tax credit (designed to foster US innovation and create skilled jobs) isn't permanent, it has been consistently renewed since its inception. It is certainly true, however, that other countries are offering multinational companies tax perks to attract their investment.
But even as companies flee US taxes, the country serves American companies by negotiating for something they fervently desire to profit abroad: US intellectual property law as a global benchmark.
When it comes to pharmaceutical companies, this is particularly important: Absent a global intellectual property regime, companies face market-by-market battles against competitors eager to reverse-engineer their products and sell them for cheap. They are already under pressure from emerging markets, which make many of the ingredients for medicines around the globe and have questioned why their people are paying so much for the drugs that are produced.
So who is fighting for the right of pharmaceutical companies to sell their wares at their prices, wherever on earth? Why, that same Uncle Sam that companies are avoiding paying taxes to: The Obama administration is negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would expand US free trade rules to eighteen countries around the Pacific rim, as well as a free trade deal with the European Union. In both, the US is pushing for “harmonization” of patent laws—including longer exclusivity for existing patents, limits on the release of drug data, restrictions on how government health care programs can control drug prices—all of which mean higher prices for medicines. It's no wonder that pharma is the most active lobbyist when it comes to trade talks.
This US push has negotiating partners, as well as American progressives, up in arms—even Europe, where national health care systems are major drug buyers, doesn't do as much to defend its pharmaceutical companies' prices around the world. The US domestic market is what allows it so much leverage—even Pfizer gets 40% of its revenues from within the US.
But if efforts to adjust US tax policies for companies operating in the rest of the world are driving Pfizer and its ilk to abandon the country, one wonders how long US efforts to “harmonize” drug prices around the globe will continue.
Karen Ball The donation kettle at the Joplin, Missouri Walgreens where a "secret Santa" dropped $100,000 in checks.
No one saw a jolly old man with a snow-white beard outside the Walgreens pharmacy in Joplin, Missouri that night. But when the Salvation Army emptied its red kettle after an evening of bell ringing on Dec. 13, it was as though Santa himself had stopped by.
Amidst the haul, a Salvation Army counting crew found five $1 bills, folded tightly into squares  each concealing a $20,000 cashier's check with "Santa Claus" listed as the remitter. (See the Top 10 Things You Didn't Know About Christmas.)
"We're pretty proud of having something like this going on here," said Capt. Jason Poff, head of the local Salvation Army. "Someone special is walking among us  they see the need and they give."
The most amazing part: such miracles are Christmas as usual in this threadbare southwest Missouri town, where a mysterious Secret Santa has been lifting spirits for years. Starting in 2004, the Salvation Army has found wondrous treasures in its humble kettles. At first, it was five cashier's checks for $10,000 each, found in different kettles around town, totaling $50,000 per season each year from 2004 through 2008. Last year, when every other economic indicator was down, Santa was doubly generous, leaving a total of $100,000 at various locations. (See the World's Craziest Christmas Lights Displays.)
This was the first year Santa put all $100,000 into one kettle, sometime between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. on Dec. 13. It was a frosty evening. Across the street from the pharmacy, the message board in front of the old brick Bethany Presbyterian Church beckoned passers-by to a coming Christmas potluck. The bell ringer, a single mom in her 20s, reported slow traffic. "She didn't think she'd gotten very many donations," Poff said. Evidently, Santa can walk right up to you, and you may not even notice. (See TIME's 2010 Holiday Shopping Guide.)
The checks were issued by the local Commerce Bank, and if the Secret Santa has an elf or two at work there, they are good at keeping a secret. Local media have tried and failed over the years to figure out who the donor might be. The anonymous gifts now total $450,000.
Joplin is an old mining town once known for its riches of lead and zinc. Historic Route 66 ran right through town, in easy reach of the old stone garage that Bonnie and Clyde used as a hideout in the 1930s. One day, the police found them. They barely escaped town after a deadly shootout, but the fleeing gangsters left a camera behind  giving the Joplin Globe a scoop, and the world perhaps the most infamous photos of the pair. In one, Bonnie held Clyde at mock gunpoint; in another, she had her foot propped on a fender, pistol in hand, and a cigar in her mouth. (See the Best Portraits from TIME 2010.)
There are signs of prosperity out by the highway, where gleaming BMW and Volvo dealerships line the road. But downtown, many of the old storefronts are boarded up. A new generation is moving in, hoping to add a little zing: a gourmet hot dog café called Instant Karma, a sleek salon with exposed brick and teal, and Spokes and Spandex, a high-end shop for cyclists.
Yet signs of hard times aren't hard to find in a town where a Family Dollar store is right across from Master C's Bargains. The Salvation Army has 898 families in its care this year, including 1,500 children. The organization invites mothers in need to fill out "Little Angel" requests to help put some Christmas in their children's lives. This year has been especially hard: moms are asking for coats and shoes, not toys. "They need the necessities," said Poff.
The Salvation Army's red kettle campaign is one of the most venerable charity projects in the United States, dating back more than a century. In 1891, a Salvation Army captain in San Francisco wanted to feed the hungry at Christmastime, and decided to try an idea he'd seen in England. A big iron kettle was set out at a Liverpool landing, and folks would toss in a coin or two to help the poor. (Read a brief history of charity songs.)
All these years later, on a sunny weekend afternoon, Nelson Clark, 55, was whistling "Jingle Bells" and keeping time with his wood-handled bell as he manned the kettle at the Walgreens where Joplin's Secret Santa had made his silent visit. "I don't know who he is, but he had the hand of God on him," said Clark.
Joplin residents seem content to let their Santa keep his privacy. "I love that kind of philanthropy," said Jason Miller, the owner of Instant Karma. Poff, the Salvation Army captain, added: "This person is not looking for an attaboy or a pat on the back. Really, it's the spirit of Christmas."
Amanda Rosenthal, a Walgreens manager, was working that night and remembers nothing out of the ordinary. The store is the area's busiest, she says, serving low-income clientele, many who must come by foot, trolley or bicycle. "You could blend in here," she said. "We're so busy, it would be very easy to just be overlooked."

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Lord Oakeshott: "Treasury officials couldn't negotiate their way out of a paper bag"
Lord Oakeshott has stood down as a Lib Dem Treasury spokesman after criticising the government's bank deal.
Ministers and the four main banks have agreed to increase loans to businesses from £179bn to £190bn this year, with lending to small firms up 15% to £76bn.
But Lord Oakeshott branded Treasury negotiators "incompetent" and demanded "radical surgery" to cut City bonuses.
The government defended the deal, but Labour said the peer had been sacked for "daring to tell the truth".
Outlining the long-awaited agreement, Chancellor George Osborne formally ruled out imposing a bonus tax, despite pressure from Labour.
'Our pockets'
Lord Oakeshott, a former City financier who advised Business Secretary Vince Cable while the Lib Dems were in opposition, said there was no guarantee of there being a net increase in lending to small business, and that the pay disclosure measures had not gone far enough.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Danny Alexander said Lord Oakeshott's departure had been a mutual decision
The public were entitled to ask why the bosses of RBS Group and Lloyds Group, which were bailed out by the taxpayer at the height of the banking crisis, would still be getting huge bonuses, he told the BBC.
He added: "Whether those are paid in cash or shares, they still mostly come out of our pockets. I see the agreement says they have to wait two more years to cash in.
"A multi-million pound bonus is still a multi-million pound bonus whether you have to wait two years to buy the yacht."
"We have done the best we can to get the best deal but I don't think it is a good deal," he said.
"And I am bound to say I think the Treasury's negotiating tactics have not been very good. They have got an awful combination of arrogance and incompetence.
"Most of them couldn't negotiate their way out of a paper bag and this has not been as tough a deal as it should have been."
But Treasury sources hit back at the peer, telling the BBC "he doesn't even know what he's talking about".
'Reflection of reality'
Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the "mutual agreement" for Lord Oakeshott to step down had been the "right decision".
Lord Oakeshott had felt "unable to support" the government's arrangement with the banks, he added.
Mr Osborne has defended the package, saying it will boost economic recovery.
Mr Cable described the agreement as "reasonable" and insisted that it would provide a "substantial" boost in lending to small firms.
However, he has said that the bonuses being paid to RBS boss Stephen Hester and outgoing Lloyds Group chief executive Eric Daniels are "extraordinarily large".
Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, said the deal was a "reflection of reality".
He added that ministers did not want to do anything to hamper the chances of getting the best deal for the taxpayer when the state-controlled banks are eventually sold back into private ownership.
For Labour, shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: "It is symbolic of the shambolic and panicked way that the chancellor has gone about agreeing this weak and toothless deal with the banks, that the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman in the House of Lords has been sacked this evening.
"It is a sad commentary on this Tory-led government that Lord Oakeshott has been forced to pay the price for daring to tell the truth."
Star Wars 8 Updates: Musical Virtuoso John Williams Now Working On The Film Score
John Williams, a man who has a deep love for music and has been critically-acclaimed for some of his works is now scoring the music for Star Wars 8. The musical virtuoso has been creating mesmerizing and unforgettable tracks for the saga throughout the years.
While some of the crew members already came and went, Williams remained a mainstay in all seven installments. And now, he must be ready to return to the studio once again for creating another remarkable score for The Last Jedi.
Filmmaker Robert Meyer Burnett spilled the beans to all his social media followers. "LAST JEDI scoring update. Last Thursday was John Williams' 85th Birthday. He's conducting. Rian Johnson wants to use the score for editing," Burnett wrote on his Twitter account.

While others are surprised about the latest Star Wars 8 news, some are also anticipating that the outcome would surpass the success of The Force Awakens' score "Rey's Theme" and "The Jedi Steps."
According to Screen Rant, Williams is expecting to finish the score in the second quarter of 2017; which means that the fans might hear the material very soon. On the other hand, the loyal fans must be patiently waiting for the official teaser to come out.
However, rumor has it that the Star Wars 8 teaser will not be out until the Star Wars Celebration kicks off in Orlando. Furthermore, the expecting moviegoers might still need to guess the on-point plot when it arrives in theaters this December.
Some of the most talked about speculations are about Rey's origin, which has been the center of debate among different threads and forums. All the theories make sense, but only the movie could tell the actual story, isn't it?
On the contrary, there might be a lot of hints sitting subtly on Episode VII. But let's keep the excitement flowing by patiently waiting for official Star Wars 8 updates from the production real soon.

Anyone who has followed the career of Bruce Campbell knows that the actor has a talent for turning up in colorful, eclectic, and sometimes downright bizarre projects. So it makes sense that Campbell's nearly two decades of living in Southern Oregon have been lively. As the cult favorite writes in his new memoir, "Hail to the Chin: Further Confessions of a B Movie Actor," since moving to Southern Oregon in 1998, Campbell and his family have encountered gun-toting neighbors, wayward skunks, severed deer legs, and other Northwest folkways.
When the Michigan native decided to move to Oregon, Campbell writes in "Hail to the Chin," his mother was living in Ashland. Campbell and his wife, Ida, were itching to get out of Los Angeles, especially after Campbell realized his work as an actor took him all over the world, so he could live almost anywhere.
Campbell asked his mother, who was dabbling in real estate at the time, to send the actor some real estate listings. He and his wife flew up and went with Campbell's mother to visit some property in the Applegate Valley, situated, Campbell writes, "on a hill with spectacular south-facing views of the Siskiyou Mountains."
Campbell was smitten. "Just like that, Ida and I were done with Los Angeles," Campbell writes. "Our new life in the wilderness had begun!"
While "Hail to the Chin" is written in the same flamboyant style as Campbell's previous memoir, "If Chins Could Kill," Campbell is straightforward when it comes to his adopted home state.
"I like Oregon," he says in a phone interview. "I like it a lot. I probably shouldn't praise it so much. Next time, I'll just write that it rains all the time."
Campbell is calling from Phoenix, a stop on his book tour. The cross-country tour will bring Campbell back to Oregon. On Oct. 13, he'll talk about "Hail to the Chin" at Powell's Books at Cedar Hills Crossing, in Beaverton. And on Oct. 14, Campbell will be at the Barnes & Noble in Medford.
In "If Chins Could Kill," Campbell wrote how he first came to fame playing Ash, the chainsaw-wielding hero of the "Evil Dead" movies, low-budget horror flicks known for their over-the-top-gore, outrageous humor and the directing flair of Campbell's former high school buddy, Sam Raimi.
Oregon's own Bruce Campbell on 'Ash vs. Evil Dead' Season 2, Lee Majors, and 'toxic hair' When he's not living in Southern Oregon, Bruce Campbell is saving the world from evil as Ash Williams in the gruesomely funny "Ash vs. Evil Dead." Season 2 of the Starz series, Campbell says, features even more gore, plus TV veteran Lee Majors as Ash's gruff father.
Campbell shares more self-deprecating stories about his career in "Hail to the Chin," including his stints playing small roles in the three "Spider-Man" movies Raimi directed, and costarring in the USA series "Burn Notice," which filmed on location in Florida.
But time and again, Campbell returns to Oregon, which he writes about with humor and verve. Campbell even includes an extended discussion of the Bureau of Land Management, and its policies.
"BLM was my neighbor on three sides, so I started to attend meetings, symposiums and lectures on land stewardship," Campbell writes. "'How to use land' is also a divisive topic. Show ten people a landscape and you'll get ten different opinions about what to do with it."
Campbell admits it's a bit unusual for an actor's memoir to include detailed explanations of how the BLM works.
"I put that in there because when I first moved to Oregon, I didn't know any of that," Campbell says in our phone interview. "I got chided by my cowriter, Craig Sanborn, for that. He goes, 'Really, Bruce, you've got a whole chapter for BLM? Do you really think that's what people are going to want?'"
But Sanborn "got his comeuppance," Campbell says. "His mother was talking to him, and she said, I really enjoyed the book, especially all this stuff about the government."
Campbell sounds amused that his book includes both "horror and BLM. Our lives should all be that rich. It demonstrates a life well lived."
Bruce Campbell on B-movies, his demigod status and "My Name Is Bruce" The Oregon-based actor has used his sense of humor to become a cult icon.
Among the other Oregon-centric sections are Campbell discussing the meth problem where he lives, and how locals call Medford "Meth-Ford"; working with Portland-based Dark Horse Entertainment on filming the movie, "My Name Is Bruce," which Campbell says he was foolish enough to shoot on his Southern Oregon property; and being a member of the Ashland Elks Lodge.
"It's spectacular," Campbell says of the Elks Lodge. "You can play cards there, the pool is 25 cents a game, unless the pool table thing is broken, and then it's just free. It's the cheapest booze you'll ever find. It's all local. And the funny thing is, they do lots of charitable stuff."
Back on showbiz topics, Campbell says he's not sure when Starz will air the completed Season 3 of "Ash vs. Evil Dead," in which Campbell plays an older version of his "Evil Dead" character.
"When you find out, will you give me a quick call?" Campbell jokes. "We're searching for an air date right now. We think it's going to be the first quarter of 2018."
(Update: Starz has announced "Ash vs. Evil Dead" Season 3 will premiere Feb. 25 2018)
Campbell's not sure if there will be a fourth season of "Ash vs. Evil Dead."
"Our bosses have new bosses now," he says referring to the Lionsgate entertainment company's acquisition of the Starz cable network. "Ash vs. Evil Dead" has done very well in DVD sales, and is distributed overseas, Campbell says. "We're also one of the most illegally downloaded shows. What does that say about our fans? They're a bunch of jerks -- 'We want it, we like it, we just don't want to pay for it.'"
Campbell says Season 3 is "very solid," and if it should prove to be the final one for "Ash vs. Evil Dead," "we made sure our storyline was wrapped up in a good way."
Bruce Campbell will discuss "Hail to the Chin: Further Confessions of a B Movie Actor," at 6 p.m. Oct. 13 at Powell's Books at Cedar Hills Crossing, 3415 S.W. Cedar Hills Blvd., Beaverton.

France's support for the new Greek government's demands for debt relief exacerbates Europe's north-south divide and could have implications for Britain's future negotiations with the European Union about changes in its membership.
Although France's finance minister, Michel Sapin, wouldn't go as far as supporting Greece's call to write off part of its debt, he did say on Sunday his government was prepared to “support Greece.” Sapin also said Greece's request to renegotiate the terms of its bailout was “legitimate” and he urged a “new contract between Greece and its partners.”
Sapin made his statements after meeting with his new Greek counterpart, Yanis Varoufakis, in Paris.
Varoufakis said on Friday he wanted nothing to do with the “troika” anymore: the representatives of the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund who have supervised the implementation of Greece's bailout. Varoufakis prefers to work directly with other European countries, perhaps thinking they would be more lenient.
Troika monitors have repeatedly found Greece falling short on its commitments. The country was supposed to reduce public spending and liberalize its economy in exchange for €240 billion in financial support from other European Union countries and the International Monetary Fund.
The new coalition government in Athens, composed of Varoufakis' and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' far-left Syriza party and the right-wing Independent Greeks, wants to cancel the spending cuts and reverse some of the structural reforms the country has done.
Days after winning an election last week, Tsipras rolled back the privatization of Greece's largest seaport and its public power utility. He also wants to rehire public workers, raise the minimum wage and reduce Greece's debt which was equal to 175 percent of economic output in 2013.
Most of Greece's privately-held debt was restructured in 2012. Some 90 percent of its debt is now owed to official creditors, mainly other eurozone governments.
Northern European countries, including Finland, Germany and the Netherlands, have rejected Greece's demands with Chancellor Angela Merkel saying she does not “envisage fresh debt cancelation” the Netherlands' Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs the meetings of eurozone finance ministers, urging Greece to stick to its commitments. “Taking unilateral steps and ignoring previous arrangements is not the way forward,” Dijsselbloem told Varoufakis last week.
France siding with Greece raises the prospect of a Mediterranean bloc resisting Germany and its allies in their push for austerity and liberalization — including getting a free-trade agreement with the United States. Greece said over the weekend it would block the treaty; France already had reservations about liberalizing transatlantic trade.
A perceived victory for Greece could especially benefit Spain's far-left Podemos party which polls predict will defeat Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's conservatives in elections this year.
Many Northern European leaders have promised their voters the money lend to Greece will be repaid in full. If they walk back those promises, it would probably raise Euroskeptic sentiment in the north where support for the single currency is nevertheless higher than in the periphery of the continent.
German leaders should be less willing to do a deal with Greece's Syriza-led government if they fear concessions will trigger anti-austerity demands in other countries as well — including France, the second largest economy in the eurozone, and Italy, the third largest. Both got another extension from the European Commission to bring their deficits in line with the bloc's 3 percent treaty limit this year.
It should also make the Germans more willing to make concessions to Britain's prime minister, David Cameron, who wants changes in his nation's membership before calling a referendum on whether to stay in the European Union or not by 2017. Generally supportive of budget consolidation and liberal economic reform, Cameron's Conservatives are allies the Germans can now ill afford to lose.

For those who can't wait that long, well-known German tuner Oettinger has introduced a hot-rodded Golf R that ups the ante with a tweaked 2.5-liter five-cylinder engine that makes 510 horsepower at 6,100 rpm and 501 foot-pounds of torque at 3,600 rpm. To put those numbers into perspective, a bone-stock U.S.-spec Golf R packs a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that generates 292 ponies and 280 lb-ft. of twist.
The straight-five is borrowed from the Audi parts bin. Oettinger has upgraded it with a large turbocharger, high-performance pistons, a new intake manifold, a heavy-duty cooling system with an intercooler, and a racing exhaust line. Linked to a six-speed manual transmission, the turbo five sends the 500R from zero to 62 mph in 3.4 seconds — on par with a Porsche 911 Turbo S not equipped with the optional Sport Chrono package — and on to a top speed of over 186 mph.
Six-piston calipers and two-piece perforated rotors bring the action to a stop, while a thoroughly revised Clubsport suspension, and Dunlop Sport Maxx tires wrapped around 20-inch alloys, keep the Golf on four wheels and pointed in the right direction.
It's quite literally impossible to mistake the 500R for a stock Golf R. Visually, the hatch benefits from a full body kit that adds a deep front bumper with three large air vents and a carbon fiber splitter, side skirts, a roof-mounted spoiler and a wide-air diffuser that integrates a pair of oval exhaust tips. The 500R is much wider than a Golf R, and Oettinger points out that the track has been widened by fitting new custom-designed aluminum axles, not by simply installing spacers.
Inside, the Golf gains bucket seats upholstered in a combination of leather and Alcantara, orange contrast stitching, and concept-specific trim pieces on the dashboard, the center console, and the door panels.
Oettinger has announced plans to build a handful of 500Rs starting later this year. Before you get your checkbook out, though, know that each one will carry a base price of approximately €150,000 (which converts to roughly $170,000) and it doesn't look like Oettinger will offer the car in the United States.
Surprisingly, the tuner promises that this 510-horsepower Golf is nothing compared to the other projects it's currently working on. Next year, Oettinger will introduce three additional versions of the Golf R that will pack 591, 641, and 738 horsepower, respectively.
Back in 2012, Facebook experimented on you. For three months prior to Election Day, the social media company set out to manipulate the emotions of its U.S. users, showing 1.9 million randomly selected Facebookers more news stories in their newsfeeds. The result of this so-called “voter megaphone” tool, according to the social media network, was “measurably increased civic engagement and voter turnout”—a similar result to a previous experiment in which Facebook “nudged” up turnout by around 340,000 people when it created an “I voted” badge for users to reveal to their friends.
What made this “voter megaphone” effect different than, say, running a televised or radio ad campaign was its invisibility. Simply put, users didn't know they were Facebook's guinea pigs—and they were shocked. They were shocked again this past June, when the social media network revealed that it had manipulated over half a million newsfeeds to manipulate its users' emotions. Facebook later apologized for “any anxiety it caused.”
Why were we getting upset? some commentators asked—and it was a good question. Not only had we agreed to this kind of thing under Facebook's Terms and Conditions, but the company's experimenting was no different from the sort of user-testing carried out every day by other big tech giants. Google, for instance, once user-tested 41 different shades of blue in an effort to find an interface element people were most likely to click on. The search leviathan similarly tweaks its search algorithms on a regular basis, promoting or demoting content in the process according to what it thinks you will be interested in. Google's homepage rarely changes to clue users in that these alterations have been made.
Milennials grow up soaked in this sort of catered-to-you technology. We think it empowers us—and we're right about that, to some degree. But in our thirst to share photos, to trade stocks and make restaurant reservations online, we cannot overlook the darker side to the tech boom: It has made us slaves to the algorithm—the underlying codes that govern the computer age. Is it possible that we live in a world in which Facebook keeps us connected, Google flatters us with tailored search results and Amazon knows what books and music we're likely to enjoy without realizing the extent to which algorithms rule our lives?
As it happens, companies like Google and Facebook are just the tip of the iceberg. Today algorithms carry out 70 percent of trades on the U.S. stock market. Tomorrow, who's to say they won't be helping us pick political leaders in the same way that Amazon's formulas suggest which products we are likely to buy: “You liked Mitt Romney, you might also like such-and-such.” Before that happens, we need to start asking the tough questions about what algorithms are and what purpose they are designed to achieve—for just because they are “scientific” certainly doesn't mean they're neutral. If Facebook's algorithms can convince a certain percentage of users to vote, couldn't they just as easily convince a certain subset of users not to?
***
The first thing we must do it shake off the widespread belief that algorithms are neutral, there to give us unbiased, objective results.
Trust in the impartiality of perceived science is far from a recent development. In his 1886 essay “The Ethic of Freethought,” the English statistical mathematician Karl Pearson argued that science's “single-eyed devotion to truth [admits] no interested motive, no working to support a party, an individual, or a theory; such action but leads to the distortion of knowledge, and those who do not seek truth from an unbiased standpoint are, in the theology of freethought, ministers in the devil's synagogue.” More than a century on, in 1989, the artificial intelligence philosopher Peter Slezak announced the dawning of a (not unrelated) age of “scientific discovery by computer … totally isolated from all social and cultural factors whatever.”
Today's billion-dollar tech giants have picked up this objective ball and run with it. In a manifesto entitled “Ten Things We Know to Be True,” Google claims, “Our users trust our objectivity.” And Google has a point, too. Very few of us stop to consider the fact that the tools that deliver search results in an average of 0.48 seconds have agendas of their own. But the reality is that of course they do—and these agendas can reflect everything from what Google's own engineers consider important to the preferences expressed by individual users.
Take something as simple as search results. Many Politico readers will be familiar with the concept of the “filter bubble,” the idea that due to personalized search services, Google will frequently produce two very different sets of search results for two different users searching for the same thing. In one famous example, the liberal who types “BP” into his or her Web browser is likely to receive information about the April 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, while a conservative typing the same two letters is more likely to get investment information about the oil company.
Similarly, algorithms are more likely to respond to a female search for “wagner” by directing the user towards sites about the composer “Richard Wagner,” while the same search by a male is taken as meaning “Wagner USA” paint supplies. As such, what is presented by search algorithms is not a formula designed to give ideologically untampered answers but precisely the opposite: search results that flatter our personal mythologies by reinforcing what we already “know” about particular issues, while also downgrading in importance the concerns that do not marry up to our existing worldview.
Although this type of targeting is probably more about enhancing UX (the User Experience) than overtly political, the end result is often quite partisan. Take, for instance, the story of African-American Harvard University PhD, Latanya Sweeney. Searching on Google one day, Sweeney was shocked to notice that her search results were accompanied by adverts asking, “Have you ever been arrested?” These ads did not appear for her white colleagues. Sweeney began a study that ultimately demonstrated that the machine-learning tools behind Google's search were being inadvertently racist, by linking names more commonly given to black people to ads relating to arrest records. A similar revelation is the fact that Google's Android app store recommender system suggests users who download Grindr, a location-based social-networking tool for gay men, also download a sex-offender locating app. In both of these cases, are we to assume that the algorithm has made an error, or that they are revealing in-built prejudice on the part of their makers? Or, as is more likely, are they revealing distasteful large-scale cultural associations between—in the former case—black people and criminal behavior and—in the latter—homosexuality and predatory behavior?
This type of profiling doesn't simply begin and end on your Google results page: As they become more powerful, more far-reaching—primary decision makers instead of support tools, algorithms are beginning to control more than just what we see on our screens—from our economy (as was the case earlier this year when a Hong Kong-based venture capital firm tasked an algorithm with making crucial decisions about which companies to invest in) to our laws.
Take predictive policing, for instance. Envisioned as a way to make law enforcement proactive rather than reactive, predictive policing is currently being rolled out around the world. It makes use of recent advances in real-time crime data recording and utilizes this for accurate forecasting. As it turns out, crimes don't occur randomly within a particular area, but rather exist in small geographical clusters, known as “hotspots.”
In Seattle, for example, crime data gathered over a 14-year period shows that half of all crime can be isolated to just 4.5 percent of the city's streets. A similar observation holds true for Minneapolis, Minnesota, where 3.3 percent of all street addresses generate more than 50 percent of calls to police. Over a 28-year stretch, a marginal 8 percent of streets in Boston accounted for a massive 66 percent of street robberies. Being able to use computer science to search for patterns in this data makes it possible to anticipate, prevent and respond more effectively to crimes that will take place in the future. If that all sounds a bit too Minority Report—referring to the 2002 Steven Spielberg sci-fi movie in which crime is all but wiped out thanks to a specialized psychic “PreCrime” police department—it is still very effective. During one of the first deployments of predictive policing, in Los Angeles, the trial period resulted in a 36 percent drop in crime rate. The algorithm's predictions about which crimes were likely to take place and where were twice as accurate as those made by a human analyst.
With an area like law, we are convinced—often correctly—that algorithms can do a better job than we can. No matter how loudly we scream and shout about robots taking over the workplace, we humans regularly have more faith in computers than in our own reasoning. “We are all so scared of human bias and inconsistency,” explains Danielle Citron, professor of Law at University of Maryland.
As a result, the creation of laws themselves will increasingly reflect algorithmic reasoning. “Ambient Law” refers to the idea that laws can be both embedded within and enforced by our smart devices and environment. Like the human body, where temperature, breathing and heart rate are regulated without our having to be consciously aware of what is happening, so too is the dream for algorithms to self-manage, self-configure and self-optimize—without the need for physical or mental input on the part of users. As technologies like on-board computers and Google's self-driving cars (which have now completed 700,000 autonomous miles on open roads) gain prominence, questions related to speeding, road safety and similar legal conundrums become enshrined in the form of algorithms. For example, an in-car system developed by Japanese carmaker Nissan monitors users from the moment they get behind the wheel, looking for signs of drunk-driving. To do this it checks the driver's breath with an alcohol odor sensor, tests for alcohol in the sweat of the driver's palm as he or she touches the gear stick, and looks for signs of drowsiness through a miniature dashboard camera. Based on an averaging of these biometrics, the car's algorithms then decide whether the person in the driver's seat is safe to drive. If not, the transmission locks, a “drunk-driving” alert sounds, and the seatbelt tightens to shock the person out of his or her stupor. Whether a person is fit to drive moves from a self-imposed standard to a computerized rule.
Similar algorithmic decision makers now play a part in deciding which prisoners are allowed out on parole, who should be given permission to board an airplane, whether assembled crowds are benign or dangerous and whether a person is eligible for welfare or other benefits. In all of these cases, politics are built directly into the codes that govern our lives.
But while allowing previously subjective ideas to be coded (or “codified”) into massive system-wide architectures is an extremely useful development, it carries with it a host of potential challenges. As slashed budgets have led to staff cuts across a variety of different sectors, automated systems have moved from simple administrative tools to primary decision-makers. In some instances, the result is a lack of transparency that obscures decision-making and reveals only the (incontestable) final decision. Shades of this problem were evident several years back in the Colorado Benefits Management System disaster, in which hundreds of incorrect rules and illegal simplifications were accidentally written into the system's codes. When Amazon messes up its algorithms, you might order a book you end up hating; but when it comes to public policy, simplified or erroneous code can have enormous consequences. One mistake can expunge legitimate voters from electoral rolls without notice, incorrectly label small businesses as ineligible for government contracts or mistakenly identify individuals as “deadbeat” parents. There are precedents for all of these dystopian situations. And while humans are certainly capable of perpetuating these same errors, what is different with algorithms is the scale: A human might make dozens of errors, while a formula can make a hundred of thousands, millions, even billions.
Worse, if we assume results churned out by an algorithm to be objective, we might not even realize there are errors. Back in 2012, the Washington Post developed a so-called “TruthTeller” algorithm to coincide with that summer's presidential-election season. The algorithm scanned through transcripts of political speeches in near real-time and pattern-matched the “facts” to a database of previously recorded, proven facts. The purpose behind the algorithm, to catch politicians in their lies, was noble enough. But the idea we would stop doing our own thinking in favor of the polygraph version of a spellcheck is disconcerting.
So what can we do about the algorithmization of everything? It seems clear that we are at a signal point in history. Algorithms can carry out complex jobs like medical diagnosis and legal work often better than humans can—and almost certainly for less money. But they also have the ability to nudge us in directions we might not choose for ourselves, whether by recommending new products for consumption, opening up and shutting down certain avenues of exploration or reminding us that it's Election Day.
As more of our lives are governed by hidden formulae, algorithms and neural networks, we need to seek understanding of these tools and, where sensible, to push for transparency. And as jobs continue to be lost to automation, It's time we ask ourselves what the value of human work actually is—what it is that we can do better than expert systems and machine learning tools and what it is that, for all the reasons discusses above, we don't want to relinquish to formulas and codes.
Algorithms allow us to navigate through the 2.5 quintillion bytes of data that are generated each day (a million times more information than the human brain is capable of holding) and draw actionable conclusions from it. They are some of the most powerful tools shaping our lives in the 21st century. It's of vital importance that we understand them—and that we realize that whatever else they might be, they're certainly not free of politics.
As technology historian Melvin Kranzberg says: Technology is neither good nor bad, but it's certainly not neutral.
So, Alan Pardew must be reflecting after the 4-1 thumping of Sunderland, this is what it feels like to be accepted. Loved, even. Your fans worshipping you with sun-kissed oratorios. Your players swallowing your percolation of managerial nous and management speak. And your team soaring up the league, from the relegation zone to the outskirts of the top 10. “Our fans were singing ‘It's like watching Brazil', and it was,” proclaimed Pardew in the giddy aftermath of Crystal Palace's fourth straight Premier League victory. And, for once, few were rolling their eyes when he strayed deep into Partridge territory.
Maybe it is time we all appreciated Pardew a little more, especially after his remarkable season. There is a graphic whizzing around the internet that bluntly illustrates his impact. When you tally up Pardew's points at Newcastle and Palace it comes to 51 from 31 games – good enough for eighth. Without Pardew at the control deck, the Magpies and Eagles nose-dived, gaining only 26 points from 31 games – relegation form. No wonder Pardew is second favourite, behind José Mourinho, to be named manager of the year.
It is a remarkable turnaround from last autumn when Newcastle stumbled out of the blocks and abuse lashed down at Pardew, week after week, game after game. During that dark period he could have taught Marcus Aurelius a thing or two about stoicism.
But, as I wrote at the time, the situation at St James' Park was “not so black and white”. Pardew had lost his two best players, Loïc Rémy and Yohan Cabaye, and also suffered bad luck during games. “He might yet turn things round,” I argued. Unsurprisingly, I was hammered by the club's fans.
Since taking charge at Palace, Pardew has won eight of 12 Premier League games, drawing one and losing three – pretty much Champions League form – and turned Glenn Murray, Jason Puncheon, Wilfried Zaha and Yannick Bolasie into the sharpest attacking quartet outside the top six. Unsurprisingly they also pass the ball more, and with greater accuracy, than they did when Neil Warnock was in charge.
And, as the analytics expert James Grayson points out, when you look at the underlying numbers, Newcastle and Crystal Palace have also been much better at generating and suppressing shots under Pardew's management this season.
There is a caveat. Palace have probably been lucky, too. According to Grayson's figures, since Pardew joined they have scored a huge proportion of their shots on target. While the league average is 30%, and Manchester City's multimillion-pound strike-force are the only team to have bettered 38% over one of the past two seasons, Palace's current rate is 49%. Could this be down to some magical Pardew effect?
Probably not. Newcastle's percentage of shots leading to goals was 25% in the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons when Pardew was manager. So Palace's rate of nearly two goals a game since the turn of the year is surely unsustainable.
But even if their form does dip, it is hard to imagine Pardew returning to the near-permanent rictus stare of his St James' Park days. He looks happy again. Happier in fact, than at any point since he was in charge of Reading a decade or so ago when he was seen as a highly progressive and promising manager.
I vividly remember the day in the spring of 2003 when he decided to allow reporters into the dressing room for the first time after their victory against Palace. It was a scene that was part Tony Robbins, part The Day Today. The walls were crammed with motivational slogans and football stats while naked, shower-ready bodies buffed up against reporters' dictaphones. “Speak to whomever you like,” Pardew insisted. “You want an instant reaction. We're giving it to you.” The experiment didn't last long: open-door policies are the stuff of American sports not English football, but it made a statement that Pardew wanted to do things differently.
Since then Pardew perhaps hasn't lived up to his, or others', expectations. He got West Ham promoted, took them to the FA Cup final and ninth in the Premier League … and was sacked six months later. He never got much from Javier Mascherano or Carlos Tevez and was hugely criticised for promoting a ‘baby Bentley' culture. The fact he drove a Ferrari added fuel to the whispers that he was brash and arrogant.
His spells at Charlton and Southampton also ended miserably, though in mitigation both clubs had financial difficulties. When he arrived at Newcastle he admitted “I don't think I'm going to win any PR battles here” and proved as good as his word, despite finishing fifth.
He has few advocates in the media, or elsewhere, but in terms of win percentage in the Premier League, Pardew's record of 37.8% is superior to many managers with better reputations, including Harry Redknapp, Roy Hodgson, Sam Allardyce and Tony Pulis. When you look at managers who have managed at least 100 Premier Leagues games only four Englishmen – Roy Evans, Bobby Robson, Kevin Keegan and, er, John Gregory – have a better win percentage.
Perhaps, therefore, it is time for a modest reappraisal. Especially now that Pardew – whose managerial career has so often had the movement of a giant see-saw, with brief and exhilarating highs followed by plunging lows – now finally seems to be on an even keel.
Rejected by Chelsea for being too small, the hero of Arsenal's Carabao Cup victory over Norwich has battled back and is beginning to catch Arsène Wenger's eye
The world of elite youth football in London is, according to David Court, one of Arsenal's senior figures in youth development over recent years, like a village. Everyone knows everyone. Young players, coaches, families, scouts – all come across each other in schoolboy football, district matches and academy games. So when Eddie Nketiah was released by Chelsea at under-14 level, word travelled fast.
Bob Arber, the head of Arsenal's academy recruitment at the time, called in the youth midfielder Joe Willock to check on the surname of the Chelsea striker called Eddie who was being let go. “He's being released?” came the reply. “He's sick! Every time he plays against us he scores.” Arsenal invited Nketiah for a trial and included him in a match against West Ham. Naturally, he helped himself to a goal. The staff watching on looked at each other and nodded. Willock was not exaggerating.
Stan Kroenke says he is at Arsenal for long term and has no Wenger regrets Read more
Liam Brady was the head of youth development at the time and Nketiah's characteristics soon won everybody over. “It is a Premier League rule – and a good rule – that when you take a boy on loan it is for a six-week period,” Brady says. “That gives ample time for the boy and the club to make a judgment. He just grew on everybody. It is not easy when you are told you have to leave a club but he has guts and seized a new opportunity. We signed him and he hasn't stopped scoring since.”
It was quite the moment on Tuesday when Willock and Nketiah were among the eight graduates of Arsenal's Hale End academy celebrating on the pitch at the end of one of those sudden footballing explosions that occur when a young talent announces himself as if casting a magic spell.
At midday this Monday the young group of Arsenal's next generation, including Nketiah, Willock, Reiss Nelson and Josh Dasilva, went to Tottenham's training ground to watch their under-23 team-mates play. Ordinarily they would be in that team, that environment, but within 36 hours Nketiah's world was transformed. He made his home debut in the Carabao Cup against Norwich, equalised within seconds, scored a brilliant and brave winner, and showcased to a crowd of 60,000 the finishing qualities that are his speciality. Out of nowhere he was trending on Twitter, his name sung to the rafters, receiving messages from Thierry Henry, complimented by Arsène Wenger, and mischievously renamed on Wikipedia as “Edward Keddar Pelé Maradona Ronaldinho Kaka Nketiah”.
It could go to a young player's head but Court is hopeful Nketiah is grounded enough, and surrounded by a loving, supportive family, to resist the temptation to get carried away. “I don't think I have seen a debut like that where the crowd have warmed to a player so much,” Court says.
“But he has not made it yet. He needs people around him to look after him. He is a great kid and his family go everywhere to watch him. Hopefully he can stay level-headed.”
A few months ago Nketiah's father saw Court at a youth game at Borehamwood, and went up to say he had never had a proper chance to thank the Arsenal staff for giving his son another opportunity after the release by Chelsea. The general feeling in the game was that Nketiah was too small, and there were doubts he would develop enough physically. Also Chelsea had Tammy Abraham impressing as a forward in the same group. Abraham, an excellent talent, has grown up to be a good seven inches taller than the 1.75m (5ft 7in)Nketiah.

Brady remembers sizing up this pocket rocket. “You could tell straight away he is a very clever player but physically he was behind boys of his age,” he says. “But the other thing that stood out was that he nearly always scored.”
Although by no means a giant he is big enough now and it was notable that Wenger was impressed to observe Nketiah outjumping two hulking Norwich defenders to glance in with power and accuracy to send Arsenal into the next round of the Carabao Cup. Although Nketiah has a reputation as a natural finisher (his record is 48 goals from 63 games between under-18 and under-23 at Arsenal, with seven goals from four England under-18 and under-19 caps) there is more to Nketiah than pure finishing. “He is a goalscoring machine,” says Court, “and the beauty is he can score with both feet and his head, but he also has great movement. You see other things in his game.”
Obviously delighted by the impact he made against Norwich, Court sent Nketiah a text the morning after his match-winning heroics: “You did us proud,” it read. “Now keep listening and learning.”
His phone soon buzzed with a reply: “Thanks for believing in me.”
Fans' group oppose Keswick and Kroenke Jr re-election
The Arsenal Supporters' Trust will vote against the re-appointment of the club's chairman Sir Chips Keswick and Josh Kroenke to the board of directors at Thursday's annual general meeting in a bid to show “significant corporate governance change is needed”.
As part of each AGM, one third of the directors must retire on rotation from their position and seek re-election. Despite opposition from the AST, Keswick and Josh Kroenke, son of the American owner, are highly unlikely not to be re-appointed to the board.
Nevertheless, the AST believes their opposition will provide an opportunity to air their grievances. “All of the non-executive directors have been in office for far too long and are not regarded as independent under the corporate governance code. There is therefore no independence from the controlling shareholder, no-one free of conflict of interest, and not enough diversity on the board or people with relevant professional skills, such as football expertise,” said the AST in a statement.
It took Microsoft three attempts to come up with a Surface concept that had broad appeal. With the combination of screen size, resolution, system flexibility, and performance, the Surface Pro 3 became a PC that worked for a lot of people. As a tablet, it was thinner and lighter and better to use handheld than any laptop, but its kickstand and magnetic keyboard meant that it offered much of the productivity that laptops boast.
Now that Microsoft has found a formula that works and demonstrated that it has some user appeal, we've seen a proliferation of similar devices from other manufacturers. The Spectre x2 is HP's consumer-oriented iteration of the concept: a 12-inch tablet with an integrated kickstand, a magnetically attached keyboard, an x86 processor, and a full desktop operating system.
Nailing the basics

For me, the most important parts of just about any computer are the parts you have to touch and look at; the keyboard, the touchpad, and the screen. These things have to be done right before I ever care about what's on the inside of the system, because if I hate using a computer, I don't really care about its speed.
Like the Surface Pro 4, the Spectre x2 is not great for using on your lap. This is contentious, I know. Some people, presumably with much longer legs than my own, think it's fine. For me, the kickstand design doesn't provide enough stability and rigidity to support comfortable on-lap usage. This is a desk/table-bound design, not a full laptop replacement.
But when used on a desk or table, the Spectre x2 is very good. The backlit metal keyboard feels very sturdy, the key travel is excellent (1.5mm, according to HP), and the layout is pretty sensible. This is a good keyboard. Like the Surface Pro 3 and 4, the keyboard has a magnetic strip that gives it a slight angle for more comfortable typing.
This is a keyboard that anyone would be happy with, one that puts many laptops, much fewer tablets, to shame.
The touchpad is also pretty decent. Its shape is a little unusual; as we've seen on some other HP machines, it's very wide without being tremendously tall. I found it tracked accurately and had a nice smooth surface. It supports the Precision Touchpad spec, too, so it provides the full range of Windows 10 touchpad gestures.
The screen is a decently bright and crisp 1920×1280 3:2 WLED-backlit affair. There are higher resolutions available from competing systems, but I didn't feel that I was missing out on much here. Viewing angles are good, the backlight seems even, and the brightness was sufficient for most viewing conditions.
But it is a touchscreen, and everything worked in that regard. More unusually, it has Wacom pen support. HP sells (though does not supply in the box) a pen for use with the Spectre x2 that supports 2048 pressure levels. The pen is an active design, using a AAAA battery that HP says will last for about 700 hours. I can't speak to the finer points of this feature based on my mediocre attempts at doodling, but tracking seemed accurate, with little discernible gap between the pen point and cursor and good precision even at low speeds. Palm rejection was also reliable.
All in all, the Spectre x2 gets these essential elements right. I don't want to tempt fate, but I suspect that this is becoming a trend across the industry. While I'm sure that things are less good at the very bottom of the market, I think it's now safe to say that there are good input and output devices across a wide range of the portable PC market. This wasn't the case even two or three years ago, but today, whatever form factor you choose, whether it be the traditional laptop, the 360 degree hinge laptop (the Lenovo Yoga and its competitors), the hinged convertible (such as the Surface Book), or the magnetic detachable (such as the Surface Pro 4 or the Spectre x2), you can find multiple competing options with keyboards, touchpads, and screens that aren't just tolerable—they're actually good. On the one hand it's disappointing that this is a notable landmark for the PC industry, but on the other, it's pleasing that a corner of some kind has been turned.
I think that the Spectre x2 also looks pretty good. The buttons feel high-quality, the detailing around the speaker grilles looks nice, and the soft covering of the keyboard is pleasing to the touch. Again, this isn't something that I felt was necessarily the case four or five years ago; shoddily built, flimsy systems that flexed and wobbled as you used them were commonplace, even on machines commanding premium prices. There's none of that with the Spectre.
Core M continues to confuse
With these basics more than satisfactory, it's time to talk about everything else. Unlike Microsoft, which only uses the Core m3 in the cheapest Surface Pro 4, HP has committed across the full Spectre x2 range to using Intel's Core M Skylake processors with 4 or 8GB of RAM.
The first Core M processors, from the Broadwell processor generation, didn't impress us. They gave up a lot of performance, performed inconsistently from system to system, and didn't seem to win much in the way of battery life in return. The Skylake Core M parts have had wider adoption, finding their way into a much larger range of systems. It's also become clearer how and why manufacturers are using them.
The Skylake Core M parts seem to be better balanced than their predecessors. In extended workloads, their low power rating limits their performance; the processor can sustain a speed of around 1.2GHz (depending on the exact model). But for short bursts, such as the initial hit you take from loading a new webpage or starting a new app, the processor can ramp up to 3.1GHz, making it every bit as quick as any other Skylake processor.
But if you think this low-power processor is going to mean better battery life, well, that's a little more complicated. We ran two battery life tests. One cycles through webpages every fifteen seconds, intended to be representative of a browsing session where you load a page and then read it for a while before moving on. The other is a heavier burden; it runs a WebGL animation continuously.
These tests have different performance profiles. The first has a burst of activity every fifteen seconds but allows the processor to idle in the gaps. The second keeps both processor and GPU continuously operating. In the first test, the x2's performance wasn't too impressive. Both the x2 and the Surface Pro 4 have 42Wh batteries, but the Surface Pro 4 (with a Core i5) could manage 491 minutes in this test. The x2 with its Core m7 only hit 430 minutes. The lower power processor lost. But perhaps that's not terribly surprising: in this benchmark, both processors idle most of the time, and they both idle at closer to zero watts.
In the second test, however, the situation was different. The x2 managed 260 minutes, compared to Surface Pro 4's 217. In this sustained workload, the Surface Pro 4's processor can run at a sustained higher speed, drawing more power. The x2, in contrast, slashes its clock speed to keep inside its low power envelope. This means that the x2 doesn't go as fast and animate as smoothly as the Surface, but it extends its battery life.
Accordingly, it's not really appropriate to think of Core M as the low power, long life option. Rather, the low power rating means it makes a different trade-off under sustained workloads. It's slower, but it lasts longer.
The low power processor isn't any cheaper, either, than the higher-powered parts. The Core m7-6Y75 in our review Spectre costs $393 from Intel. The Core i7-6600U in the high-end Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book is also $393.
It doesn't appear to translate into a lighter laptop, either. The Spectre x2 is surprisingly heavy. OK, it's still not heavy heavy, but at 1.84lbs for the tablet unit alone, it weighs more than any of Microsoft's latest generation of tablets.
So what's the point of the Core M part? Simple: it obviates the need for a fan. The Spectre x2 is fanless, ensuring silent operation with no moving parts. That feature should let systems be a little slimmer, lighter, and more reliable.
Overall, the Spectre x2 feels perfectly snappy and pleasant to use. I wouldn't get one for gaming or software development or running a ton of virtual machines because I don't think the Core M is really up to it. But for general Office-type tasks, Web browsing, and e-mail, the device is a decent option.

As we reel from one natural disaster after another—hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, wildfires in California—climate scientists explain how they're not really “natural” at all. They're the anticipated consequence of a breakdown in the world's climate, one that will become far more extreme as global temperatures rise from the current 1° Celsius above historic norms to 1.5° (perhaps within ten years) and then 2° potentially as early as twenty years from now.
With headlines proclaiming the dire effects of these disasters on local economies, it might seem reasonable to believe that the power-brokers of our economic system—investors, CEOs, Federal Reserve policymakers—will eventually recognize the danger and wield their financial might to shift our civilization's trajectory away from climate catastrophe.
That may turn out, however, to be wishful thinking. In the short term, these disasters do indeed cause harm to the economy, but after the initial shock they're more likely to have a net positive impact on the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In the words of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, “There clearly is going to be an impact on GDP in the short run. We will make it up as we rebuild. That will help GDP.”
Welcome to the cruel, topsy-turvy economic logic of a civilization facing the risk of collapse. As millions of people increasingly suffer the devastation of climate breakdown, we can expect the economy—as measured by conventional benchmarks—to maintain and even strengthen itself right up to its breaking point.
The reason for this apparent disconnect between economics and society's well-being arises from the use of GDP as the benchmark of economic success. GDP merely measures the rate at which our society is transforming nature and human activities into the monetary economy, regardless of the ensuing quality of life. Anything that causes economic activity of any kind, whether good or bad, adds to GDP.
That's why hurricanes and firestorms, catastrophic as they may be to the people experiencing them, can be positive for the conventional economy. Devastated communities mean big profits for the companies supplying materials, technology, services, and finished goods for the rebuilding. The thousands of people in California at risk of long-term bronchial problems from smoke inhalation represent a boon for GDP, as their increased healthcare requirements only serve to boost economic activity.
This disconnect between GDP and the health of our society means that, even when things become more desperate for people as climate breakdown worsens, investors may keep enjoying high returns on their investments while neoliberal economists point to stock market valuations as proof that things are not as bad as they might otherwise seem.
This scenario has been predicted by Jorgen Randers, a member of the team that wrote the seminal Limits to Growth report back in 1972, and author of the more recent 2052: A Global Forecast for the Next Forty Years. Randers, who has spent a lifetime working through the nonlinear feedback effects of our global system, expects that we'll be spending as much as 36% of global GDP in replacing infrastructure by mid-century. “These are huge hikes,” he writes, “and difficult to grasp, until one starts considering the cost of moving megacities and transporting infrastructure to safer grounds.”
However, this increase in GDP will only occur in countries that still have the infrastructure to rebuild what gets destroyed. For more vulnerable societies, one huge swath of destruction—from a hurricane, flood, or drought—could leave them so devastated that they find themselves permanently removed from the 21st century global technological economic matrix. That may be a real risk right now for Puerto Rico: with its electrical grid, water supply, and finances in ruins, its only hope for a return to normalcy will be through massive investment from the US mainland—something the Trump regime seems unlikely to support.
Is this what civilizational collapse may look like in the 21st century? Not one dramatic event that brings down the whole house of cards in a moment, but a gradual disintegration of regions that lack the wherewithal to recover from climatic disasters, while the more developed and affluent nations enjoy economic booms and soaring stock market valuations?
It's not too late to turn around this terrifying trajectory, but as long as we measure a country's success by its GDP, that's going to mask the true destruction taking place in the quality of people's lives. Recognizing this, forward-thinking economists have come up with more accurate measures of a country's welfare. One of these, the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), incorporates negative factors such as income inequality, environmental pollution, and crime, as well as positives such as volunteer work and household work. It shows that, in contrast to GDP, which has been soaring for the past 70 years, GPI peaked worldwide in 1978 and has been falling ever since.
At this point, our society can still choose to invest in a future that builds genuine welfare rather than shoring up collapsing infrastructure. In an urgent but still hopeful report, 2020: The Climate Turning Point, members of the highly-respected Potsdam Institute show there is still time to turn things around. Just. And the profound irony is that we can do this by investing in the very things that create welfare for society. “This moment of history,” they declare, “is not a burden; it is a tremendous opportunity.” They estimate that worldwide investment in a sustainable future—one with cleaner air and water, fulfilling livelihoods, more livable cities, and regenerating ecosystems—could make the world $19 trillion wealthier by 2050.
An important step to move toward this more hopeful trajectory would be to substitute a true measure of society's health such as GPI for the currently ubiquitously GDP. As long as our political and financial leaders are evaluated by the distorted measure of GDP, our civilization may well disintegrate from climate breakdown even while they get credit for a cruel, topsy-turvy economic boom.

Goldfields woman fined $4,000 after falsely accusing taxi driver of sexual assault
Updated
A magistrate has scolded a 45-year-old Boulder woman for wasting police resources after she made up a sexual abuse allegation against an innocent Perth taxi driver.
Allison Louise Reardon told police she had been sexually assaulted in June, sparking an investigation by detectives from the Sexual Assault Squad.
But Reardon, who was attending a work conference in Perth at the time, has now been fined $4,000 in the Kalgoorlie Magistrates Court after pleading guilty to creating a false belief.
The court heard Reardon became upset after she claimed the driver took the long way to her destination during her 12-minute taxi ride.
She allegedly tried to break the driver's identification card before she eventually called triple-0, with the recording tabled as evidence.
In the call, Reardon was telling the operator about the dispute and was asked if there was anything life-threatening occurring.
"Well, he sexually assaulted me," she replied.
Reardon claimed the driver had placed his hands down her pants, on top of her underwear.
But detectives reviewed closed-circuit television footage and found the assault never took place.
"The CCTV footage shows the driver did not assault the woman as she described," police prosecutor Senior Constable Thomas Banyard told the court.
Reardon's lawyer Carmel McKenzie told the court her client suffered from "a number of mental health issues" and had been taking anti-depressant medication for the past 10 years.
Ms McKenzie said her client's medication had been changed and she had also been placed on blood pressure medication for other health issues.
"She had been struggling at that time and in fact her husband did not feel she was well enough to attend the conference, but she didn't want to let her employer down," Ms McKenzie said.
Taxi driver 'just doing his job': magistrate
Ms McKenzie said Reardon had consumed some alcohol at a work function over a period of about 90 minutes before getting into the taxi.
She said Reardon was "disorientated", "confused" and "not cognisant".
But during sentencing, Magistrate Adam Hills-Wright told Reardon there was no evidence to suggest there was a connection between her alcohol consumption and medication that reduced her "moral culpability".
He said it was a "serious example" of the offence, which can carry a maximum sentence of up to 12 months' jail and a $12,000 fine.
Mr Hills-Wright said the taxi driver was just "doing his job".
"You've placed this driver in anybody's worst nightmare … it is anybody's worst nightmare where they are falsely accused of a sexual crime," he said.
"You maintained this lie over several hours while speaking to the triple-0 operator, police and even the Sexual Assault Squad.
"They are a specialist squad for bona fide abuse cases, and you wasted their resources."
Reardon will also be required to pay $480.34 in reparations for police overtime and $198 in court costs.

The Environmental Protection Agency's proposal to crack down on carbon pollution from power plants would create more than a quarter of a million additional jobs, according to a new analysis by economists using a trusted, sophisticated model.
The findings support the EPA's argument that the benefits of its approach exceed the costs, and undermine the claims of the fossil fuel industry that the rules would cripple the economy.
"The proposed Clean Power Plan is likely to increase U.S. employment by up to 273,000 jobs," said the report, which extends the forecast out to the year 2040. "For perspective, this is roughly the equivalent of one month of healthy job gains."
Significant job losses at shuttered coal-fired plants and at coal mines would be offset not only by investments in cleaner sources of power, but also by productivity gains across the whole economy—and by overall reductions in wholesale prices of electricity, the authors said. Many households and businesses would end up with extra cash in hand to spend on other goods and services. The overall effect of the rules would boost economic growth, but not significantly.
The study was done by two economists, Doug Meade of the University of Maryland's inter-industry forecasting project, and Jason Price of Industrial Economics, a private consulting firm. They applied a complex economic model to examine the impact of the proposal on jobs much more broadly than the agency has previously done.
Their work was funded by the Energy Foundation, a nonprofit group that promotes energy efficiency and renewable energy. Supported by philanthropies, it draws its board from industry, academia, and non-governmental organizations.
"We really didn't have any prior notion going into the study" about what the analysis would show, said Price. The finding on jobs growth, said Meade, was "relatively small but we are very happy to say it was not negative." Tom Lyon, a specialist in corporate environmentalism at the University of Michigan who reviewed their work to assess its credibility, called it "very impressive." All three spoke on a conference call with reporters.
Job growth, the researchers concluded, would be about five times faster than the EPA had projected, because the agency had looked only at the direct impact of its proposal while the new analysis calculated the ripple effect across the whole economy.
The fastest gains would come during the first 10 years of the new regulations. Proposed last year, the rules are due to be published in final form this summer and, if they survive challenges in Congress and through the courts, would begin to take effect by about 2020.
The EPA rules seek for the first time to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plant smokestacks, one of the main sources of the principal greenhouse gas. The proposal is a central feature of the Obama administration's climate action plan. Without a plan like this, the United States will be unable to meet its pledge to cut emissions sharply in the coming decade. That, in turn, could undermine progress toward a new global climate treaty.
The EPA rule gives states a broad menu of possible approaches to cutting carbon dioxide emissions: encouraging power plants to burn coal more efficiently; urging grid operators to choose natural gas over coal-fired power; offering incentives for consumers to conserve electricity; spurring the use of renewables, and broadly accelerating the shift to a carbon-free energy economy. States would be encouraged to expand regional cap-and-trade programs, adding more flexibility – and complexity.
Without broad changes like these, scientists have warned, the world is headed toward dangerous warming in the coming century.
The economic tremors are hard to predict. Business as usual, however, means a growing buildup of greenhouse gases.
Last week, in its annual energy outlook, the Energy Department's statistical branch didn't take into account the Clean Power Plan as it made its predictions about energy supply, demand, prices and pollution from now until 2040. (The omission follows the agency's practice of not factoring in proposals until they take effect.)
With a business-as-usual baseline, the forecast said that greenhouse gas emissions would barely budge.
The new study issued on April 21 described at length how complicated it is to explore the many repercussions of such a complex rule. It said the EPA's earlier estimates was "a reasonable first approximation."
This time, the economists used a macro-econometric model known by the acronym LIFT, a tool that connects data from 97 different industrial sectors and attempts to show how changes in one part of the economy affect the others. "That is, the model works like the actual economy," they wrote.
Even though jobs would be lost among workers at money-losing coal mines (perhaps 10,000 jobs) and at old, inefficient power plants that would be shut down rather than cleaned up (about 40,000), there would be many times more jobs created among those hired to build cleaner new plants or to install pollution controls. And because the EPA's plan also encourages conservation of electricity and switching to renewable fuels, jobs in those sectors would grow, as well.
The authors said it is also important to look at the ripple effect on jobs, because electricity affects the whole economy in one way or another.
Partly for that reason, EPA is proposing to let states meet carbon pollution goals in part by encouraging conservation, emissions trading, renewable power, and other steps beyond the fossil fuel plants. The agency says that feature of the plan makes it more efficient. Critics have said it represents an over-reaching regulatory intrusion into the economy at large.
Either way, the ripple effect on jobs has been debated since the proposal was issued a year ago. Even before the proposal was put out for public comment, industry groups were predicting that it would cost jobs.
At a Congressional hearing last year, one of the Republican opponents of the rule, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, pressed the EPA's witness, Janet McCabe, on exactly this point: "Has the EPA examined the ripple effects of this throughout the economy?"
"No," she told him. "No, we haven't."
Next time the question comes up, the agency will have new evidence on its side.
Sa Aking Mga Kabata by Gat Jose Rizal Country Philippines Language Filipino
"Sa Aking mga Kabata" (English: To My Fellow Youth) is a poem about the love of one's native language written in Tagalog. It is widely attributed to the Filipino national hero José Rizal, who supposedly wrote it in 1869 at the age of eight.[1] There is no evidence, however, to support authorship by Rizal and several historians now believe it to be a hoax.[2] The actual author of the poem is suspected to have been the poets Gabriel Beato Francisco or Herminigildo Cruz.[3]
Prominence [ edit ]
Kun sino ang kumathâ ng̃ "Florante": kasaysayan sa buhay ni Francisco Baltazar at pag-uulat nang kanyang karunung̃a't kadakilaan (1906) by Hermenigildo Cruz. Note that the poem uses the Philippine Commonwealth-era Tagalog spelling with a 'K'. If Rizal had indeed written it, it should have used the phonetically equivalent Spanish 'C'. The oldest known copy of the poem appears in
The poem was widely taught in Philippine schools to point out Rizal's precociousness and early development of his nationalistic ideals.[1]
A passage of the poem often paraphrased as Ang hindì marunong magmahal sa sariling wikà, masahol pa sa hayop at malansang isdâ (English: 'He that knows not to love his own language, is worse than beasts and putrid fish') is widely quoted to promote the use of Tagalog among Filipinos. It is encountered most frequently during the Buwan ng Wika ('Language Month'), a commemoration of the establishment of the Filipino language as the national language of the Philippines.[4][5]
Publication history [ edit ]
No manuscript for Sa Aking Mga Kabatà written in Rizal's handwriting exists.[6] The poem was first published in 1906, a decade after his death, in a book authored by the poet Hermenigildo Cruz. Cruz claimed that he received the poem from another poet, Gabriel Beato Francisco, who in turn received it in 1884 from an alleged close friend of Rizal, Saturnino Raselis. José Rizal, however, never mentioned anyone by the name of Saturnino Raselis.[2][7] The poem may have actually been written by Cruz or Francisco.[2][3]
Pascual H. Poblete published a different account in his introduction to the 1909 translation Noli Me Tangere; Novelang Wicang Castila Na Tinagalog Ni Pascual H. Poblete (note old Tagalog spelling), he claims that the poem was well-known to Filipino poets during Rizal's childhood.[8] This account was later repeated in Austin Coates' 1968 biography of Rizal, Rizal: Philippine Nationalist and Martyr, who further added that Juan Luna had a role in preserving the poem. This is not substantiated by any known evidence.[3]
The earliest known poems of Rizal in the National Historical Institute's collection, Poesías Por José Rizal, also date six years after the alleged writing date of Sa Aking Mga Kabatà. His own account of the earliest awakening of his nationalistic views, identifies it as the year 1872 – the year of the executions of the priests Mariano Gómez, José Apolonio Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora.[9] The poem is never mentioned by Rizal himself in all his voluminous writings, despite its apparent significance in terms of his future ideals.[3]
Authenticity [ edit ]
Historian Ambeth Ocampo, National Artist of the Philippines and writer Virgilio S. Almario and others have debunked Rizal's traditional authorship of the poem based on the following:[2]
The poem uses the Tagalog word kalayaan (liberty/freedom). However, Rizal first encountered the word at least by 1882, when he was 25 years old – 17 years after he supposedly wrote the poem. Rizal first came across kalayaan, or as it was spelled, kalayahan, through a Tagalog translation by Marcelo H. del Pilar of Rizal's own essay El Amor Patrio.[2][10]
The fluency and sophistication of the Tagalog used in the poem also do not match Rizal's grasp of the language. Although Rizal's native tongue was Tagalog, his early education was all in Spanish. In the oft-quoted anecdote of the moth and the flame from Rizal's memoir, the children's book he and his mother were reading was entitled El Amigo de los Niños, and it was in Spanish.[11] He would later lament his difficulties in expressing himself in Tagalog. In 1886, Rizal was in Leipzig working on a Tagalog translation of Friedrich Schiller's William Tell, which he sent home to his brother Paciano. In the accompanying letter, Rizal speaks of his difficulty finding an appropriate Tagalog equivalent of Freiheit (freedom), settling on kalayahan. Rizal cited Del Pilar's translation of his own essay as his source for kalayahan.[2][10] Rizal also attempted to write Makamisa (the intended sequel to El filibusterismo) in Tagalog, only to give up after only ten pages and start again in Spanish.[2][3]
The 8-year old Rizal's apparent familiarity with Latin and English is also questionable.[2][3] In his memoir as a student in Manila, a year after the poem's supposed writing date, he admitted only having 'a little' knowledge of Latin from lessons by a friend of his father.[12] Rizal also did not study English until 1880, more than ten years after the poem was allegedly written. English was not a prominent language in the Philippines in 1869 and its presence in the poem is believed to betray later authorship during the American Commonwealth of the Philippines.[3]
The poem also makes use of the letters 'K' and 'W', whereas during Rizal's childhood, Tagalog spelling was based on Spanish orthography where neither of the letters were used. The letters 'C' and 'U' were used instead. (i.e., the poem would have been spelled "Sa Aquing Mañga Cabata") The shift in Tagalog and later Filipino orthography from 'C' to 'K' and 'U' to 'W' were proposed by Rizal himself as an adult, and was later made official in the early 20th century by the Philippine government as per grammarian Lope K. Santos's proposal.[2]

Sa Aking Mga Kabata
Kapagka ang baya'y sadyáng umiibig
Sa kanyáng salitáng kaloob ng langit,
Sanlang kalayaan nasa ring masapit
Katulad ng ibong nasa himpapawid.
Pagka't ang salita'y isang kahatulan
Sa bayan, sa nayo't mga kaharián,
At ang isáng tao'y katulad, kabagay
Ng alin mang likha noong kalayaán.
Ang hindi magmahal sa kanyang salitâ
Mahigit sa hayop at malansáng isdâ,
Kayâ ang marapat pagyamaning kusà
Na tulad sa ináng tunay na nagpalà.
Ang wikang Tagalog tulad din sa Latin
Sa Inglés, Kastilà at salitang anghel,
Sapagka't ang Poong maalam tumingín
Ang siyang naggawad, nagbigay sa atin.
Ang salita nati'y huwad din sa iba
Na may alfabeto at sariling letra,
Na kaya nawalá'y dinatnan ng sigwâ
Ang lunday sa lawà noóng dakong una. To My Fellow Youth
If a nation's people certainly love
The gift of their language bestowed by heaven,
So too will they regain their pawned freedom
Like a bird who takes to the sky.
For language is a measure of worth
Of cities, nations, and kingdoms,
And each person alike deserves it,
As does any creation born free.
One who does not treasure his own language
is worse than a beast or a putrid fish,
Thus it should be nurtured intently,
As a mother nurtures her child.
The language Tagalog is like Latin,
Like English, Spanish, and the language of angels
For the Lord, in His wisdom
Bestowed it, He gave it to us.
Our language is like that of others,
With its own alphabet and its own characters,
But they vanished as if a sudden storm had come upon
A boat in a lake in an age long past.

Kundiman, a genre of traditional Filipino love songs
(CNN) -- Chileans gathered in a candlelight vigil early Sunday morning to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the 8.8-magnitude earthquake that killed 521 people and left thousands homeless in the South American nation.
President Sebastian Pinera was among those attending the vigil in the coastal town of Cobquecura, the epicenter of last year's quake.
A bugler played "Taps" after a moment of silence at 3:34 a.m. -- the exact time when the quake struck.
"I remember that morning as if it were today," Pinera told the crowd of mourners, describing the quake as "the most destructive in the history of our country."
The president, who was weeks away from taking office when the quake struck, recalled his experience visiting the most devastated parts of the country -- hearing screams of anguish of people trapped beneath tons of cement and seeing dazed victims wandering the streets in search of water.
Pinera said dozens remained missing a year after the quake, and said more than 2 million people in the country were "directly and personally affected" by the quake and ensuing tsunami.
"We are all aware that there are still many countrymen who remain victims of this earthquake and this tsunami," Pinera said.
After the vigil, he told CNN Chile that the country had completed "a little more than half" of the reconstruction required after the massive quake destroyed 220,000 homes, thousands of schools and hundreds of hospitals.
"That is a gigantic accomplishment for all Chileans," he said.
He told CNN Chile that about 70,000 homes had been rebuilt or were under construction, and pledged that all victims who lost their homes would have a permanent place to stay before the beginning of winter 2012.
At the vigil, Pinera closed his remarks by leading the crowd in singing the country's national anthem, and called on Chileans to unite across political boundaries to continue rebuilding efforts "stone by stone and brick by brick."
Additional memorial events were scheduled throughout the day Sunday.
“Imagine a war of autonomous machines.”
Four key words, freighted on their own, fearsome in combination: Imagine. War. Autonomous. Machines. The sentence is quoted from a documentary film by the late Harun Farocki. It is the obsessive central topic of a tribute by Trevor Paglen, published last year. It is, Paglen writes, one of “two critical warnings about a future that has already come to pass … an observation about the relationship between seeing and contemporary warfare.”
Paglen has made a career of art about what he calls the “unseeable and undocumentable.” His work points obliquely to what can't be observed straight on. That often includes potent but highly secret weapons of surveillance and battle — photographs of barely discernible military satellites and drones, lost in a vast sky; images of closely guarded installations, recorded through high-power telescopes; endlessly scrolling lists of operation code names.
His latest project moves from his Berlin studio back to the Bay Area, where he got his start after earning a doctorate in geography from UC Berkeley. From now through May, Paglen will be artist in residence at Stanford University's Cantor Arts Center.
The residency begins with a performance designed by the artist in collaboration with the musicians of the Grammy Award-winning Kronos Quartet and Obscura Digital, a company known for high-tech visual productions and projections. “Sight Machine,” as the work is called, is his first foray into live presentation.
The new work deals with what he refers to as “machine vision” — the seemingly boundless arena of image making and processing upon which more and more of our society relies. Machine vision is essential today to commerce, manufacturing, security, communications, entertainment, medicine — even to a newly invented ritual of “friendship.” It guides driverless cars on our highways and unmanned missiles to their targets.
The product of machine vision is, mostly, invisible images. “We are increasingly living in a world,” he told me a few weeks ago, “where probably most of the images in the world are made for machines — by machines for other machines, and humans aren't in the loop.”
Paglen's current project is an attempt to understand this new vision and to give it form that we can see. Working with a team of five to seven assistants, he is interpreting, for humans, image analysis algorithms originally designed only to sort the 1s and 0s used by computers. For the Kronos Quartet staging, some of those algorithms will be applied to video images of the live performers, then projected in the industrial space where audience and musicians sit.
“For me, this art project is just starting to try to learn how to see this emerging photographic landscape — this machine vision landscape which is not readily visible to our eyes. Because it normally just happens inside a black box somewhere.”
Paglen's residency at Stanford was initiated in conversation with Alison Gass, chief curator and associate director at the Cantor. It is, Gass says, “a pilot for what we hope will be a regular program.” The artist plans to be on campus “a week or so every month,” and will deliver the annual Wilsey Distinguished Lecture on Feb. 8.
The project will culminate in a major exhibition Gass plans for late 2018 — a show she thinks of as “The History of the 20th Century through the Eyes of Trevor Paglen,” she says, though Paglen prefers to call it a history of machine vision, beginning with the famous animal motion studies conducted at Stanford by Eadweard Muybridge in the late 1800s. Both agree that she would select an exhibition of Paglen's work, while he would curate a historical section or companion.
Paglen comes to Stanford with the goal of working with faculty, researchers and students not only in the fine arts, but in disciplines not so closely associated with the Cantor Center. The work of two scholars, in particular, attracted him. Jennifer Granick is a lawyer and the director of civil liberties for the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School; Fei-Fei Li is director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab and the Stanford Vision Lab.
The conflicts and challenges of work in the area of artificial intelligence and machine vision are highlighted by comments that seem offhand at first. One is from a recent article by Paglen, who asks, “Can humans learn how to see like the seeing machines that are becoming ever more ubiquitous?” The answer to the question could determine the degree of control human beings will exercise over the machines they have created.
Li, on the other hand, is seeking to teach machines to make sense of the images they capture. In an entertaining TED talk available online, she articulates a distinction between vision, which is a neutral process based on physical characteristics, and seeing, which requires interpretation.
“By ‘seeing,'” she says, “we really mean ‘understanding.'” The ethical conundrums of thinking machines may be the stuff of science fiction, but they are no less serious for their popular depiction.
“Facebook's facial recognition algorithm, called ‘Deep Face' — it's more accurate than humans,” Paglen tells me. “It's better at identifying a face than any human person is. It can look at a picture of you as a baby, that it's never been trained on, and recognize that it's you — with high accuracy.
“That's just one domain. If we're talking about self-driving cars, if we're talking about industrial processes and manufacturing — if you're doing quality assurance — you want to do that with machine vision.
“In general, those are the things that are driving the emerging world of machine vision. Those equations of optimization and labor. This has, I think, dramatic implications for the way that the world is going to look — in terms of, what does labor look like? What does policing look like? What do municipal services look like? What does credit or insurance look like?
“And when you start doing that, now you're living in a world in which rights and freedoms are being allocated by metadata signatures.”

THIS morning I heard a corporate-governance expert ask "what do compensation policies incent managers to do?" It wasn't a fluke; a little later she used incent again. The meaning is clear enough: to give someone an incentive. But where did it come from, and do we like it?
The Oxford English Dictionary answers the first clearly enough: incent is "apparently a back formation". A back-formation is one of those words invented because they seem to have been at the root of a different word. "Pease" was once the mass noun for a bowlful of little round things that you eat. Many English-speakers over time thought this was a plural count noun, though, and so pea is a back-formation. Many enter the language as successful words. Resurrect is also a back-formation, from resurrection.

The OED's first citation for incent is 1977, for those tempted to bemoan modern management speak; incent is almost as old as this blogger. Awkwardly, though, incent has a rival, incentivise. Incentivise is probably older (the first citation is from 1968). Many traditionalists don't like adding -ize or -ise willy-nilly to nouns to make them verbs, but these same types don't like back-formations either. Moreover, these are often the same people (like Strunk & White, or the editor of The Economist's style book) who tell you to omit needless words wherever possible. "To give someone an incentive" is longer than "to incentivize" and "to incent", and "incent" has the virtue of being a bit shorter.
All told, incentivise isn't going to be tripping off my tongue too often, but it's more legitimate to me than incent, and its brevity speaks in its favour. But we try to incent commenters to jump in here with little tag-questions at the end of a post, so what do you think? Incent, incentivise or to give an incentive?
Golf Star Killed in Train Accident
Mrs. Dorothy Campbell Hurd Howe, the only woman ever to hold the American, British, and Canadian amatuer golf championships, was killed on this day in 1945. She was killed by a train in Yemasse, South Carolina when she accidentally fell off the train station platform onto the rails.
Born in Edinburgh in 1883, Dorothy Campbell achieved greatness in 1909 when she captured the woman's national amateur title in the United States and the same year won the British Championship. The following year she added the Canadian title to her string of hardware. In the twenty or so years after her critical success, she won numerous local & state tournaments. In the 1938 U.S. Senior Women's Amateur Championship she won with a record score of 159. Her last national victory was in 1924.
She had been visiting friends in Beaufort, South Carolina and was killed while changing trains in Yemassee for the New York bound express. At the time she lived with her daughter-in-law as he son was an army Sergeant stationed in the Philippines.

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said he's “frustrated” the NBA doesn't have a Chinese player in the League right now.
Silver added that if relatively small countries like Serbia, Lithuania and Latvia can produce multiple NBA players, so should the world's most populous country. Starting at 22:35:
https://youtu.be/f7O9su6n__g?t=22m35s
“It frustrates me that there are no Chinese players in the NBA right now. “There's probably more basketball being played in China than anywhere else in the world. And more NBA basketball is being watched in China than anywhere else in the world.” “One of the things that we have worked on with Yao is the creation of academies in China. “So we can bring together some of the best players at a young age, they can compete against each other, they can compete internationally in the summer, because ultimately that's what enables them to become NBA players.”
The NBA is working with Yao Ming to create basketball academies to foster more organized, high-level training for Chinese players. And slow progress is being made.
Houston's 2016 second-round pick, 21-year-old Zhou Qi, is working out with the Rockets this summer and has a chance to make the roster next season.
Last summer, Zhou dropped 13 points on 5-9 shooting against Team USA in the 2016 USA Basketball Showcase.

In a sport where empirical analysis has become vitally important, little is now taken for granted within baseball. Indeed, one of the central tenets of sabermetrics is to question everything, to challenge even the game's longest-held assumptions in the hopes of correcting any unseen biases. Conventional wisdom isn't so much attacked as it is scrutinized and re-examined in a manner where faulty generalizations are remedied and room is made for nuance.
In the world of scouting, the jump from High-A to Double-A has long been seen as the most critical for a prospect's future. Double-A, the thinking goes, is where a minor leaguer's true ability is tested for the first time against competition that can also list “future big leaguer” as a realistic goal.
It's the level where weaknesses are often uncovered — that hole in a hitter's swing now exposed, that pitcher's inconsistent command now a problem that needs fixing. If you excel in Double-A, there's a pretty good chance you'll get a shot in the majors, and sometimes you'll even bypass Triple-A altogether.
But why is Double-A the proving ground for prospects? Why is this level the place where the game's most talented youngsters truly cement themselves as major-league ready?
Why, in other words, are the adjustments made at Double-A so telling and significant for a prospect? And is this still the case, as conventional wisdom has long assumed?
“Double-A isn't a magical level where unexpected things happen,” FanGraphs' lead prospect analyst Kiley McDaniel told me via email. “It's more a product of how the minor league promotion system works.”
This reality becomes more clear when looking at the makeup of Triple-A squads, which aren't stocked with prospects but rather used as “more of an inventory level for big league rosters,” as McDaniel puts it. While plenty of future major league stars make their way through Triple-A, the level is also filled with failed and fringy big leaguers who are in their late 20s and early 30s — aged long past the point where they can still be considered legitimate prospects. Every once in a while, said players will even become folk heroes.
A step below in Double-A, however, teams are still looking to shape future big leaguers from less fully formed balls of clay. Rarely do you see players aged into their late 20s (except on rehab assignments), and the overwhelming majority of players on the roster have a reasonable chance of reaching the majors.
As a result, McDaniel says, “Double-A is the highest level where development is still happening.”
Further down the minor league ladder in A-ball, the competition isn't nearly so consistent and challenging, especially for baseball's most talented youngsters.
Speaking about the differences between the lower levels and Double-A, long-time prospect writer John Sickels talked about the “winnowing process” that has occurred once players move into the upper minors.
“This sounds banal, but it is true: The players are simply better [in Double-A]. At the A-ball level there are many ‘organization players' and roster-filler types who aren't likely to succeed at higher levels…pitchers with 86 mph fastballs, position players who can defend competently but don't have impressive bats, etc.”
Sickels also pointed out how there are 60 rosters at the A-ball level, but just 30 Double-A teams. “There are half as many roster spots to fill. It is the key step in distinguishing roster-fillers from genuine prospects.”
So what differentiates a minor leaguer who performs well at Double-A from those who simply succeed against weaker competition down in the lower levels?
The Streaks: Drysdale and Hershiser in Parallel by Shane Tourtellotte Two consecutive scoreless innings pitched streaks bound two hurlers together in history.
For one, hitters have to show they can excel against pitchers with plus velocity and good secondary offerings.
“A Double-A pitching staff will have more genuine prospects, more guys throwing in the 90s, more guys with refined breaking pitches and more guys with sharper command,” Sickels said.
Consequently, young hitters who feast on easier competition due to athletic ability alone often have difficulty making adjustments.
As Al Skorupa, a member of Baseball Prospectus' prospect team told me, “In A-Ball, some guys have loud enough tools that they succeed without refining their approach.” He said that's no longer the case in Double-A, where pitchers “really throw more strikes and locate a lot more consistently.”
Given that pitchers possess better command across the board, hitters aren't able to succeed by taking tons of pitches and getting ahead in the count against hurlers who don't consistently locate their fastballs.
“Lots of hitters will show a falsely good approach in the low minors,” Skorupa said. “Those guys get promoted and suddenly you're not waiting out Double-A pitchers like that. Suddenly you're down 0-2 a lot and your slash line plummets. Most of these issues aren't exclusive to the Double-A jump, of course. All these issues exist at every level jump to some degree. It's just at that level, we see the biggest degree of differences.”
Of course, pitchers face similar challenges upon reaching Double-A. Where once they could dominate lower-minors competition solely with big velocity, hurlers now have to mix in secondary offerings and sharpen their command.
“One noticeable change for pitchers moving from High-A to Double-A is the ability to consistently locate a breaking ball while also throwing around 90 mph,” McDaniel said. “Those two abilities alone will likely get a pitcher through the A-Ball levels pretty easily.”
Just as hitters face a tougher brand of competition, so too do pitchers have to prove that they can continually succeed against better quality opposition. At a level where batters are beginning to develop a smarter, more refined approach, young hurlers can't overmatch batters without their own well-executed plan.
“A typical Double-A hitter is less likely than his A-ball counterpart to chase junk pitches outside the strike zone,” Sickels said. “You're more likely to find hitters capable of handling major league quality fastballs; there are fewer weak bats that you can just overpower. If your command isn't sharp, or if you don't have something to go with your fastball, those weaknesses will get exposed quickly in Double-A.”
As a result, fastball command and the consistent ability to get ahead in the strike zone grow in significance once a pitcher reaches the upper minors. The emphasis is less on developing and improving upon new offerings and turns instead toward sharpening up the rough edges remaining in one's game.
Development, in other words, is no longer always the primary motivation. With the bright lights of the majors beckoning, the sharpening of tools into usable big league skills takes a more central role. And this notion — that Double-A is the place where the focus begins to shift toward the major leagues — is what separates the upper minors from A-ball. Adjustments are now made with a view toward how one can contribute at the major league level. Room for growth still remains, especially among the youngest players, but Double-A is where prospects begin preparing for how they'll contribute in the majors.
As Skorupa told me, “In Double-A, it's time to stop focusing on developmental issues with players and shift focus to ‘how can this player help the major league team in the near future?'”
“You really are just a phone call from the majors once you hit Double-A, so we've gotten to the point there where teams are thinking of your place on the depth chart.”
With the game far more competitive between the lines, players also have to take their preparation off the field more seriously. When a prospect reaches Double-A, there are few guys still remaining who can be labeled as “projects.” Players who have the talent but not necessarily the work ethic and/or desire to improve on their weaknesses rarely reach the upper minors.
“Players really need to have their heads on straight by Double-A. You can't be someone who's not taking his prep work seriously at this point,” Skorupa said.
Indeed, the increased professionalization of the game at Double-A is another challenge prospects face. The talent level is more uniform in a way many minor leaguers have never encountered before, with few youngsters able to succeed on their athletic ability alone anymore.
For the first time, a prospect who has long dominated his peers, from Little League to high school to the lower minors, might have to experience extended failure. A player's aptitude for making adjustments, putting in the extra work and being open to advice from coaches only grows in importance.
What this underscores are the tremendous nuance in player development and all the adjustments prospects have to make — both on the field and off — at a young age to succeed against increasingly tougher competition. Just about every player who reaches Double-A has the physical skills to play in the big leagues, but those skills become less and less of a separating factor the further one climbs up the minor league ladder.
This is what makes projecting a prospect's future performance so difficult, of course. The process of determining why one prospect failed while another thrived, why one youngster makes the necessary adjustments and the other can't is remarkably opaque. So many factors affect a young ballplayer's maturation, and organizations are just starting to focus on those.
Since hiring Gabe Kapler as the club's director of player development last offseason, the Dodgers have begun concentrating on numerous new ways to aid the growth of their prospects. They memorably posted a sign in their dining room during spring training that declared the club as “the healthiest team in pro sports,” with Kapler emphasizing the importance of nutrition and eating healthy. Under Kapler, the team is also stressing the value of communication and mental health, two factors that have been frequently overlooked in player development.
You can bet the Dodgers aren't the only organization bringing progressive thinking to the minor leagues, even if the club's efforts are the most publicized. The impact these different approaches ultimately have on prospect development remains to be seen.
This season, of course, a bevy of talented youngsters have debuted in the majors, and many are making a big impact from day one. Plenty of rookies, moreover, have gotten their initial exposure to big league competition straight from Double-A in 2015, with the likes of Miguel Sano, Byron Buxton, Michael Conforto and Kyle Schwarber all skipping over Triple-A to contribute to their big league teams.
From this perspective, the significance of Double-A on a prospect's path to the majors hasn't changed one bit. If anything, the upper minors have grown only more competitive and more vital to a youngster's development into a major league-ready player. As Jeff Zimmerman has shown at FanGraphs, players are now hitting their primes earlier, with their best performances coming at younger ages than we've traditionally seen.
Much of this is the result of how players are developing down on the farm, and Double-A is still the place where a prospect must make the most crucial adjustments to his game. Not every minor leaguer who excels at Double-A will turn into a major league star, but the level still tells us the most about a prospect's outlook.
With baseball's best players only growing younger, Double-A remains the proving ground where prospects are shaped into major leaguers.
South Africa has returned to the top of the MRF Tyres ICC ODI Team Rankings after sweeping aside Sri Lanka 5-0 at Centurion on Friday.
South Africa had entered the series against Sri Lanka, trailing number-one ranked Australia by four points. However, Australia's 0-2 defeat against New Zealand and South Africa's own 5-0 win over Sri Lanka means South Africa has now moved ahead of the world champions.
A delighted South Africa captain AB de Villiers said: ““We are excited to be back at the top of the ICC ODI Team Rankings. We have had some trials since the World Cup two years ago but have worked hard to rebuild and to gain some form and consistency in this format.
“It's an important year for us with the ICC Champions Trophy in June and regaining the No.1 position is a step in the right direction for our preparation ahead of the event. It's a tight contest at the top so it'll be important for us to continue putting in the performances so that we can hold onto the position.”
South Africa last sat on top of the tree in November 2014 before India moved to the number-one position after defeating Sri Lanka by 5-0. Later that month, Australia claimed the coveted top spot after defeating South Africa 4-1.
This is the fifth time South Africa has surged to the top since the current rankings system was introduced in 2002. It enjoyed top positions in February 2007, March-May 2008, January-August 2009 and October-November 2014.
Since the 1 May 2016 annual cut-off, South Africa has played 17 ODIs, winning 13, including 11 on the trot. Its three loses have been against the West Indies (two) and Australia (one), while one match ended in a no-result.
South Africa will now get a chance to create further daylight between it and Australia when it plays five ODIs against New Zealand from 19 February to 4 March. To retain the top spot, South Africa will have to win the series by 3-2 or better. If New Zealand wins by 3-2, then South Africa will slip behind Australia by a fraction of a point.
Meanwhile, Sri Lanka has dropped three points following its performance in South Africa. While it has stayed in sixth position on 98 points, its pre-series 10-point lead over Bangladesh has been reduced to seven points, with eighth-ranked Pakistan another two points behind.
England plus the seven highest-ranked sides on the MRF Tyres ICC ODI Team Rankings as on 30 September 2017 will qualify automatically for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019. The remaining four sides from the ODI table along with six sides from the ICC World Cricket League will feature in the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier 2018 to fight for the remaining two places in the pinnacle 50-over to be staged in the United Kingdom from 30 May to 15 July.

At the O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence conference earlier this week, Baidu Research announced DeepBench, an open source benchmarking tool for evaluating the performance of deep learning operations on different hardware platforms. Greg Diamos and Sharan Narang of Baidu Research's Silicon Valley AI Lab talked at the conference about the motivation for developing the benchmark and why faster computers are crucial to the continued success of deep learning.
The harbinger of the current AI Spring, deep learning is a machine learning method using “artificial neural networks,” moving vast amounts of data through many layers of hardware and software, each layer coming up with its own representation of the data and passing what it “learned” to the next layer. As a widely publicized deep learning project has demonstrated four years ago, feeding such an artificial neural network with images extracted from 10 million videos can result in the computer (in this case, an array of 16,000 processors) learning to identify and label correctly an image of a cat. One of the leaders of that “Google Brain” project was Andrew Ng, who is today the Chief Scientist at Baidu and the head of Baidu Research.
Research areas of interest to by Baidu Research include image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, robotics, and big data. Its Silicon Valley AI Lab has deep learning and systems research teams that work together “to explore the latest in deep learning algorithms as well as find innovative ways to accelerate AI research with new hardware and software technologies.”
DeepBench is an attempt to accelerate the development of the hardware foundation for deep learning, by helping hardware developers optimize their processors for deep learning applications, and specifically, for the “training” phase in which the system learns through trial and error. “There are many different types of applications in deep learning—if you are a hardware manufacturer, you may not understand how to build for them. We are providing a tool for people to help them see if a change to a processor [design] improves performance and how it affects the application,” says Diamos. One of the exciting things about deep learning for him (and no doubt for many other researchers) is that “as the computer gets faster, the application gets better and the algorithms get smarter.”
Case in point is speech recognition. Or more specifically, DeepSpeech, Baidu Research's “state-of-the-art speech recognition system developed using end-to-end deep learning.” The most important aspect of this system is its simplicity, says Diamos, with audio on one end, text on the other end, and a single learning algorithm (a recurring convolutional neural network), sitting in the middle. “We can take exactly the same architecture and apply it to both English and Mandarin with greater accuracy than systems we were building in the past,” says Diamos.
In Mandarin, the system is more accurate in transcribing audio to text than native speakers, as the latter may have difficulty understanding what is said because of noise level or accent. Indeed, the data set used by DeepSpeech is very large because it was created by mixing hours of synthetic noise with the raw audio, explains Narang. The largest publicly available data set is about 2000 hours of audio recordings while the one used by DeepSpeech clocks in at 100,000 hours or 10 terabytes of data.
The approach taken by the developers of DeepSpeech is superior to other approaches argue Narang and Diamos. Traditional speech recognition systems using a “hand-designed algorithm,” get more accurate with more data but eventually saturate, requiring a domain expert to develop a new algorithm. The hybrid approach adds a deep convolutional neural network. The result is better scaling but again the performance eventually saturates. DeepSpeech uses deep learning as the entire algorithm and achieves continuous improvement in performance (accuracy) with larger data sets and larger models (more and bigger layers).
Bigger is better. But to capitalize on this feature (pun intended) of deep learning, you need faster computers. “The biggest bottleneck,” says Narang, “is training the model.” He concludes: “Large data sets, a complex model with many layers, and the need to train the model many times is slowing down deep learning research. To make rapid progress, we need to reduce model training time. That's why we need tools to benchmark the performance of deep learning training. DeepBench allows us to measure the time it takes to perform the underlying deep learning operation. It establishes a line in the sand that will encourage hardware developers to do better by focusing on the right issues.”
SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF/AP) — The Trump administration has agreed to fully fund a $650 million federal grant for electrification of the Caltrain system that would also help California's high-speed rail project.
The Federal Transit Administration announced its decision on the Caltrain funding request Monday. California Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris, both Democrats, quickly celebrated the decision.
The Trump administration had previously delayed a decision on the grant request after congressional Republicans pushed the administration to reject it.
They asked the Transportation Department to block approval of the grant to electrify Caltrain between San Jose and San Francisco until an audit of the bullet train's finances is completed.
California's $64 billion high-speed rail project would share the electrified tracks through the South San Francisco Bay Area when it is completed.
Shovels could be in the ground as early as June.

My 4-year-old daughter is learning to count. She is obsessed by it. She counts everything:
1.. 2.. 3.. 4.. 5.. 6..
Everywhere we go.
Most of all though she counts steps. Particularly in castles and cathedrals (which is fun) and car parks (which when you are laden with bags full of shopping… that you just want to put it in the car… before your arms drop off… is less so).
In truth she isn't very good at counting. If we are counting the steps to the top floor of a car park her number and mine never agree.
There are two reasons why she is wrong (and I am right):
1. She makes mistakes:
Counting is difficult:
Fifty seven
Fifty eight
Fifty nine
Twenty
Twenty one
You get the idea.
2. She isn't clear
3 steps up and 1 step down makes it 2 steps high (Daddy logic).
3 steps up and 1 step down makes it 4 steps (yes but it is a step Daddy, I just stepped it).
Adults like to count as well
We count a lot, just not steps, we count calls and customers and jobs and money. We call it management information.
Of course management information isn't information if it is wrong. So we obsess about making sure it is right, that the numbers match, that we have a single source of the truth.
But expecting a single truth is naïve. If two people count the same thing they will count it differently and you will get two different numbers.
1. We make mistakes.
We count complicated things. Imagine working out the number of calls that come into a call centre that gets:
Sales calls
Quote calls
Service calls
After sales calls
Out bound calls
Calls from customers
Calls from people who aren't customers
Calls from staff members
Transferred calls
Chase calls
All those calls are recorded on different databases, at different frequencies, using different technologies.
The more convoluted the thing we are counting the more likely we are to get it wrong. And we all love complexity. So we get the numbers wrong all the time.
Nobody is perfect.
2. We aren't clear
We all define things differently; when is a call?
Are we talking sales calls or service calls?
What about a service call that lead to a sale?
Are internal calls calls?
If a call is a wrong number, should you count it as a call?
How about ring backs and outbound calls?
Do you want Monday to Sunday or week commencing Saturday?
Should you count a call from the second it starts or the second it finishes?
The answer to these and a myriad of other questions often depends more on the reason you are counting calls than the fact that a phone rang.
Please don't be naïve
Don't obsess about the precise number. Stand back and look at the bigger picture.
Look at the pattern over time; is it varying the way you would expect it to?
Look at the relative sizes of things, work out if the numbers are big or small.
Apply the Pareto principle, work out which number is the one to worry about.
But most importantly of all, ask yourself why you are counting this thing in the first place?
Do you really need to know how many steps there are in Trinity Square car park?
When the lift is broken the answer is plenty.

(CNN) The Food and Drug Administration urged parents Friday to not use Hyland's homeopathic teething products containing belladonna, commonly known as deadly nightshade -- a toxic substance.
"We discontinued it because we are committed to our moms and our dads who choose to trust us to put medicines in their young infants' mouths, and we didn't want to put them in a place between the FDA warning and us saying the product was safe and having to decide who to trust," said Mary C. Borneman, a spokeswoman for Hyland's.
Homeopathic teething tablets, which have been around since the early 1900s, provide temporary relief to babies growing their first teeth.
The FDA originally issued a safety alert in 2010 that recommended against Hyland's Teething Tablets based on laboratory results showing that they contained inconsistent amounts of belladonna. Since then, the agency has received more than 400 reports of adverse events linked to teething products that contain belladonna.
"Most describe serious adverse events, like seizures," said Lyndsay Meyer, a spokeswoman for the FDA. "We are also aware of reports of 10 deaths during that time period that reference homeopathic teething products."
Whether these deaths directly relate to teething products "has not yet been determined and is currently under review," Meyer added.
The FDA issued a second belladonna warning in September . Though Hyland's discontinued the product in October, it continued to affirm the safety on its website.
"Our understanding is that the Food and Drug Administration's investigation of these products is still ongoing," says the company's news release issued at that time. "The fact is that we have not been made aware of any medical or statistical evidence to support a causal link between homeopathic teething tablets and adverse outcomes at this point. We continue to request any available information and statistics from the FDA."
The FDA announcement Friday confirms its original laboratory assessment of inconsistent amounts of belladonna.
"They showed some limited data on samples they tested that indicated inconsistent amounts of belladonna alkaloid at the nanogram level," Borneman said. However, the results "remained within the documented margin of safety."
"The implication in the FDA release is that consumers who still have the product shouldn't use it because it might be unsafe," she said.
The FDA release noted that Raritan Pharmaceuticals, based in New Jersey, recalled three of its belladonna-containing homeopathic products in November, yet Hyland's had not issued a recall.
"They never actually asked us to recall it, nor did we ever actually refuse to recall it," Borneman said. "We're a 114-year-old company. Families are the core of what we do. If we really thought there were any safety issues, we would definitely take the next step."
Typically, labels claim that homeopathic teething products contain "natural ingredients," such as chamomile, a daisy-like plant recommended by midwivees for calming babies with colic, and calcarea carbonica, which is made from shells and is, essentially, an impure version of calcium carbonate an ingredient used in antacids.
Some also include belladonna.

"Since the body's response to belladonna in children under 2 years of age is unpredictable, using such products places them at unnecessary risk," Meyer said. Therefore, the FDA recommends that parents stop giving babies any product that contains belladonna "and dispose of any in their possession."
Instead of teething gels or tablets, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends gently rubbing or massaging the child's gums with your finger and giving the child a cool (not cold) teething ring or a clean, wet, cool washcloth to chew on.
Though they're discontinued, Borneman stands by the safety of Hyland's Teething Tablets: "They are a top-selling product and a consumer favorite, and sadly it resulted in the loss of 24 jobs."

Barack Obama announces removal of ban on first visit, saying there is a new level of trust and cooperation with former enemy
The US has lifted a decades-old arms embargo on Vietnam in a historic move that follows the country's growing assertiveness against China's influence in the region.
Speaking on a visit to Hanoi, Barack Obama said Washington had fully lifted “the ban on the sale of military equipment to Vietnam that has been in place for some 50 years”. Obama is the third American president – after Bill Clinton and George W Bush – to visit since the war ended in 1975.
“At this stage both sides have developed a level of trust and cooperation,” he added during a joint press conference with the Vietnamese president, Tran Dai Quang.
Quang said the end to the embargo was “clear proof that both countries have completely normalised relations”.
Despite a shared communist ideology, Vietnam is one of several countries engaged in a fierce territorial dispute with Beijing over islands and reefs in the South China Sea, a route for roughly £3.17tn in trade. The area is also thought to have significant oil and gas reserves.
China has reclaimed several atolls that Vietnam says it owns, and built military installations and runways on some islands.
Vietnam, a country of 90 million, has also been a key partner for the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), a US-led trade deal seen as a counter to China's growing influence.
However, Obama said the decision to lift the ban was not based on China but on “our desire to complete what has been a lengthy process towards moving toward normalisation with Vietnam”.
The Chinese state-run newspaper Global Times ran an editorial titled “Obama unable to turn Hanoi into an ally” and said while Beijing was a major opponent of Hanoi regarding the South China Sea, “the former is also considered by Hanoi's mainstream elites as a political pillar for Vietnam's stability”.
Activist groups have called for Obama to push for greater respect for human rights in Vietnam, where there are about 100 political prisoners in jail. In March, seven activists were sentenced for “spreading anti-state propaganda”.
The ruling Communist party has run a one-party state since 1954.
There has also been a recent round of arrests against environmental protesters, angered after 100 tonnes of dead fish were found near a Taiwanese-owned industrial complex.
The Vietnamese government has cracked down on any attempt to protest, blocking access to Facebook over the weekend.
And on Sunday, the BBC reporting team was told their accreditation to cover Obama's visit had been withdrawn without reason.
Obama said on Monday that any future arms sales would need to meet strict requirements “including those related to human rights”.
Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, criticised the move.
“Obama has jettisoned what remained of US leverage to improve human rights in Vietnam – and basically gotten nothing for it,” he said.
“The United States government has been telling the Vietnam government for years that they need to show progress on their human rights record if they are going to be rewarded with closer military and economic ties. Yet today President Obama has rewarded Vietnam even though they have not done anything of note.”
Diplomatic ties between the US and Vietnam were restored in 1995. In 2007, the US allowed the sale of some non-lethal equipment and last December, Washington said it would provide five unarmed patrol boats to the Vietnamese coastguard.
Following his three-day trip in Vietnam, Obama will travel to Japan for a G7 summit and a visit to Hiroshima.

Tool played just one show in 2015, a Halloween concert in Tempe, Arizona during which the band dressed up as members of Led Zeppelin and possibly debuted a new song. However, in 2016, Tool plan to take the show on the road as they've announced plans for an extensive US tour.
According to a Facebook post likely penned by frontman Maynard James Keenan, the “sonic and visual extravaganza” will take place during the month of January, and see the four-piece ensemble “dwarfed by dramatic video projections.” Additionally, the opening acts “will in all likeliness be exciting to many Tool enthusiasts.”
A full list of shows will be announced shortly. Update – Tuesday, November 17th: The initial eight tour dates have been announced. Find them here.

A North Korean passenger jet travelling from Pyongyang to Beijing on Friday has been forced to land in Shenyang following a possible fire onboard, according to China's Xinhua news agency.
The Air Koryo plane can be seen on tracking website Flightradar24 following its scheduled path to Beijing before continuing north to Shenyang and landing at around 9:50 am Korea Standard Time (KST).
Xinhua, citing a passenger who was onboard the jet, wrote in the report that “the plane caught fire”.
The plane was Air Koryo's Tupolev TU204-300 P-632 jet, one of two TU204's that regularly conduct flights from Pyongyang to Beijing and subsequent return flights. Air Koryo's scheduled Pyongyang – Beijing routes are the JS151 and JS152 return flights as well as the JS251 and JS252 return flights.
According to tracking data, the P-632 plane reached its top altitude of 29,925 ft at 9:25am KST before steadily decreasing to around 15,000 ft in just over 10 minutes. It then dropped rapidly to 6,000 ft within 5 minutes and subsequently landed at around 9:50am.
The P-632 is one of Air Koryo's most active jets and last successfully completed the JS251 and JS252 flights between Pyongyang and Beijing on July 21. Not including Friday's failed flight, the P-632 had flown 18 times in July so far.

ICE and CBP Release End of Fiscal Year 2017 Statistics
WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced its end-of-year immigration enforcement numbers, the results of a year-long return to enforcing the law, upholding the integrity of our lawful immigration system, and keeping America safe. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2017, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reported 310,531 apprehensions nationwide, 303,916 of which were along the Southwest border, underscoring the need for a physical barrier at the border. Additionally, in FY 2017, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Removal Operations (ERO) conducted 143,470 arrests and 226,119 removals. While 2017 marked a successful year in border security efforts, reducing illegal cross-border migration, increasing interior enforcement, and dismantling transnational criminal enterprises, multiple challenges still remain in providing immigration officials with the tools needed to keep criminals off the streets, eliminate the pull factors for illegal immigration, and remove aliens who have violated our immigration laws from the country. The previously announced Trump Administration's immigration priorities would address these challenges by enhancing border security, implementing a merit-based immigration system, and closing loopholes that encourage illegal immigration.
“We have clearly seen the successful results of the President's commitment to supporting the frontline officers and agents of DHS as they enforce the law and secure our borders,” said Acting Secretary Elaine Duke. “We have an obligation to uphold the integrity of our immigration system, but we must do more to step up and close loopholes to protect the American worker, our economy, and our communities.”
“We have seen historic low numbers this year - an almost 30 percent decline in apprehensions in FY17, but we are very concerned about the later month increases of unaccompanied minors and minors with a family member,” said Acting Deputy Commissioner Ronald Vitiello. “We are also concerned about the significant uptick in the smuggling of opioids and other hard narcotics, including heroin and cocaine, which generally increase when illegal border crossings spike. The men and women of CBP, working along our borders and at the ports of entry protecting our great nation, are doing outstanding work. For us to truly have an operationally secure border, we must close loopholes in our laws that help fund the cartels.”
“These results are proof of what the men and women of ICE can accomplish when they are empowered to fulfill their mission,” said Thomas Homan, ICE Deputy Director. “We need to maintain this momentum by matching the dedication and drive of our personnel with the resources they need to perform at even higher levels. We need to confront and address misguided policies and loopholes that only serve as a pull factor for illegal immigration. We must continue to target violent gangs like MS-13, and prevent them from rebuilding what we have begun to dismantle. Finally, we need to find a solution to the dangerous sanctuary city policies and the politicians who needlessly risk innocent lives to protect criminals who are illegally present in the United States.”
Customs and Border Protection
In FY17, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded the lowest level of illegal cross-border migration on record, as measured by apprehensions along the border and inadmissible encounters at the U.S. ports of entry. However, in May CBP began to see a month-over-month increase in apprehensions and inadmissible cases along the Southwest border, most notably from children, either as part of a family unit or unaccompanied by their parent or legal guardian.
In addition to the 310,531 apprehensions by U.S. Border Patrol agents there were 216,370 inadmissible cases by CBP officers in FY17, representing a 23.7 percent decline over the previous year. Illegal migration along the Southwest border declined sharply from January 21 to April, which was the lowest month of border enforcement activity on record.
By the end of the year, family-unit apprehensions and inadmissible cases reached 104,997 along the Southwest border. Another 48,681 unaccompanied children were apprehended or determined to be inadmissible.
CBP continues to be concerned about steady increase in the flow of unaccompanied children and family units from Central America, as transnational criminal organizations continue to exploit legal and policy loopholes to help illegal aliens gain entry and facilitate their release into the interior of the country.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
The most significant changes in immigration enforcement strategy can be found in the interior of the United States. The executive orders issued by President Trump in January 2017 strongly emphasized the role of interior enforcement in protecting national security and public safety, and upholding the rule of law. By making clear that no category of removable aliens would be exempt from enforcement, the directives also expanded enforcement priorities for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Overall, in FY 2017, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) conducted 143,470 arrests and 226,119 removals. Notably, from the start of the Trump Administration on January 20, 2017 through the end of the fiscal year, ERO made 110,568 arrests compared to 77,806 in FY2016 - an increase of 40 percent. During the same timeframe, removals that resulted from an ICE arrest increased by 37 percent, nearly offsetting the historically low number of border apprehensions, a population that typically constitutes a significant portion of ICE removals. Total ICE removal numbers for FY17 (226,119) reflect a slight decline (6%) from FY2016 (240,255), largely attributed to the decline in border apprehensions.
ICE continued to prioritize its resources to enhance public safety and border security, which is demonstrated by the data, which reflects that 92 percent (101,722) of aliens ICE administratively arrested between January 20, 2017 and the end of FY2017, were removable aliens who had a criminal conviction or a pending criminal charge, were an ICE fugitive, or were an illegal re-entrant.
The executive orders also prioritized efforts to dismantle transnational gangs, with a specific focus on MS-13, one of the most violent gangs in the United States. In FY2017, ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) arrested 796 MS-13 gang members and associates, compared to 434 in FY2016 – an 83 percent increase. Overall, HSI made 4,818 criminal arrests related to gang activity and 892 administrative arrests as a result of gang investigations. Additionally, ERO administratively arrested 5,225 gang members and associates.
Overall in FY17, HSI conducted 32,958 total criminal arrests and seized $524 million in illicit currency and assets over the course of investigations into human smuggling and trafficking, cybercrime, transnational gang activity, narcotics enforcement, human smuggling and other types of cross-border criminal activity.
Employee Satisfaction
In addition to these improved numbers, the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) results for CBP and ICE personnel significantly improved this year, reflecting that the Administration is allowing them to faithfully execute their duties and fully enforce the law.
Earlier today, ICE, CBP and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services participated in a press briefing to announce the end of year numbers. Click here to watch the recording.

“This is an extensive body of secret law,” the Brennan Center for Justice said of opinions, memos and letters kept secret by the Justice Department, pictured above, and other federal entities. (J. David Ake/AP)
The Justice Department has kept classified at least 74 opinions, memos and letters on national security issues, including interrogation, detention and surveillance, according to a report released Tuesday by the Brennan Center for Justice.
Also still classified are between 25 and 30 significant opinions issued between 2003 and 2013 by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), the secretive federal court that interprets the law governing foreign intelligence-gathering inside the United States.
And at the State Department, 807 international agreements signed between 2004 and 2014 have not been published.
Despite President Obama's pledge to make government more open and transparent, federal agencies are still keeping a considerable amount of policy and legal interpretations under wraps, the Brennan Center found.
[Read the Brennan Center's report]
The opinions and memos by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) were written between 2002 and 2009, said the report's author, Elizabeth Goitein, who obtained several data sets through Freedom of Information Act requests.
“This is an extensive body of secret law, which is fundamentally incompatible with democratic self-governance,” said Goitein, the co-director of the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program. “When the government makes law out of the public eye, the results are more likely to be tainted by bias or groupthink, and are frankly more liable to violate statutes or to be unconstitutional.”
But senior national security officials said the government has in fact been particularly transparent in recent years.
“In the last several years the government has engaged in an unprecedented level of transparency regarding its intelligence collection authorities,” said Brian Hale, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Hale said that the transparency includes releasing thousands of pages of documents related to foreign intelligence surveillance on U.S. soil and numerous FISC opinions, including five opinions this year.
The Office of Legal Counsel material that is still secret includes memos documenting advice given over the phone to agencies. They also cover the United States' response to terrorism, the country's intelligence activities and international humanitarian law, Justice Department officials said.
Goitein cited as a particularly disturbing example a 2002 OLC memo advising the White House that torturing al-Qaeda terrorists in captivity abroad “may be justified” and that the international laws against torture “may be unconstitutional if applied to interrogations.”
That memo, written by then-OLC head Jay S. Bybee, became public only after it was obtained and published by The Washington Post in 2004. The White House subsequently disavowed the memo.
It is possible that some of the still-classified advice involves little in the way of new legal analysis, but “we have no way of knowing whether that's the case,” Goitein said. And, she said, “such a large quantity of secret law on these significant topics is inherently problematic.”
Justice Department spokesman Kevin Lewis said the department's goal is to make OLC opinions available when possible while still protecting classified national security information. “Some opinions may not be appropriate for public release because they could reveal classified national security information or implicate confidential executive branch deliberations,” he said in a statement. “OLC opinions often contain information classified by another agency, and in those circumstances the department typically would not be able to disclose that information unless it was declassified by the originating agency.”
The State Department's international agreements are binding agreements between nations negotiated by the president under authority delegated by Congress. There is no legislative ratification. Published agreements have dealt with issues such as food safety and commitments to partner with foreign militaries in training exercises.
But 42 percent — almost half — of all international agreements and treaties dating from 2004 to 2014 have not been published. The Case Act of 1972 requires that international agreements be made public, but it allows for certain exemptions, such as for national security purposes.
“The number is pretty stunning if they're right,” said Oona Hathaway, an international law professor at Yale University and a former national security lawyer in the Defense Department's Office of General Counsel.
State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that “not every non-publication of an agreement is due to national security purposes.” The law affords multiple exemptions, he noted. He also said that some matters might be the subject of ongoing litigation, which the department cannot comment on.
Between 25 and 30 significant opinions from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court through June 2013 remain classified, the center reported, citing Justice Department data.
“The government,” Hale said, “continues to review for declassification and public release additional older FISC opinions as part of the on-going transparency effort.”
On Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a motion in the FISC, seeking the release of all the court's important, still-classified rulings since Sept. 11, 2001. These opinions cover topics including cellphone location tracking by “Stingray” devices and the government's use of malware to hack targets' computers.
After the 2013 disclosures by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, Congress last year passed the USA Freedom Act, which requires the director of national intelligence to conduct a declassification review of each opinion that includes a significant interpretation of law, and to make the opinion public “to the greatest extent practicable.” At the very least, the intelligence director must make an unclassified summary of the significant interpretation of the law.
All of the significant opinions and orders from June 2015 to the present have been declassified and released pursuant to the new law, according to the national intelligence director's office.

Leap
The new venture-backed private transportation service Leap began offering rides in San Francisco last week in a swanky shuttle meant to feel "more like a living room than a bus." A ride with the service, which costs $6 one-way or $5 in bulk, comes with WiFi, USB ports, a laptop bar and locally made pressed juices (for sale on board, that is).
Most of the passengers on-board at first appeared to be skeptical journalists. Private mass transit is a touchy topic in San Francisco, where many fear the tech industry is creating parallel amenities — private campuses, private transportation, private cafeterias — where tech workers don't have to bump into the masses. With this latest twist, Leap and a few other startups, are offering up-scale rides to anyone in the public with a smartphone, although the intended clientele here still seems to lean toward tech. Leap so far is running one route that collects and drops off commuters around a hub of tech offices downtown.

Services like this, though, raise some broader issues that are not particularly unique to San Francisco, nor to the tension the tech industry has created there. Public transit is ripe for disruption — that's why investors are backing these ideas. If you were to look around any city and try to identify a problem in need of lucrative new solutions that emerging technology might provide, the dreaded commute is an obvious one. Public transit can be inefficient, unpredictable, slow, crowded, or on its worse days downright broken. Transit needs a shakeup.
But as private providers increasingly offer what looks like a first-class alternative, the risk isn't that companies like Leap will eventually replace public transit; it's that they'll turn it into even more of a ride of last resort used primarily by the poor. If Leap is successful — and it's entirely likely it won't be, because a transit system is incredibly costly to operate — San Francisco and other cities could wind up with one public bus system for all the people who need a $2 ride, and one private bus system for the people who want to sip a $7 iced coffee on the way.
This would siphon needed fares from transit systems. But it could also sap public willingness to invest in them. The answer isn't that higher-income riders should have to use poor public transit because lower-income riders do, too. It's that we should throw innovation at the problem of public transit itself, not simply at the promise that some people could afford a work-around.
In other parts of the world, we already know what this might look like.
Three years ago, Microsoft was seen as a hellish place to work following a devastating profile in Vanity Fair. The company was portrayed as a miserable environment where employees were set against each other in an attempt to survive an onerous and unfair grading process called stack ranking.
That was then and this is now. The company has received the Global Randstad Award for 2015, an independent employer branding survey that identifies the most attractive employers among thousands of companies. The survey collected the opinions of more than 225,000 respondents in 23 countries.
The award doesn't mean that Microsoft is the best place to work; it measures where IT professionals most want to work. Coming in second was Sony, which speaks to the company's legacy because it has been in chaos for years and has sold off most of its businesses. Coming in third was Samsung.
"Congratulations to Microsoft: for the first time in the 15-year history of the Randstad Award, the winner scores #1 on all drivers of choice of potential job seekers! That is quite remarkable, considering the fierce competition of employers in finding and retaining talent, and IT professionals in particular," Randstad CEO Jacques van den Broek said in a statement.
No doubt the appointment of Satya Nadella to the CEO spot helped. He's done wonders to help with the problems, real and perceived, under his predecessor Steve Ballmer. While Ballmer was very popular internally with the developers, developers, developers, he was also the one behind stack ranking, which poisoned the well with everyone else.
Things have not all been smooth under Nadella. He's laid off 18,000 people in a series of waves to consolidate and streamline the company following the takeover of Nokia's Devices and Services unit.
Microsoft recently issued earnings that showed Nadella's "Cloud first, mobile first" is a split of success and failure. The cloud business, from Azure to Dynamics to Office 365, grew 106% year-over-year and is currently on track to reach $6.3 billion in annualized revenue. That would make Microsoft a bigger cloud company than Salesforce. (I am so looking forward to Benioff's reaction to that.)
On the downside, the Windows Phone business is still stinking up the earnings. Integration of the Nokia Devices and Services division cost $190 million and Microsoft loses 12 cents on every handset sold. For the quarter, Microsoft sold 8.6 million handsets. Apple, on the other hand, sold 61.2 million iPhones in the same period.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed defensive ends Tavaris Barnes and Sterling Bailey to their roster on Tuesday with several players sidelined with injuries during OTAs.
According to Greg Auman of the Tampa Bay Times, Robert Ayers, Noah Spence, Jacquies Smith and Ryan Russell all sat out practice with the Buccaneers on Tuesday. All four are expected to be ready for training camp.
In the meantime, Barnes and Bailey give the Buccaneers the bodies they need to practice with at this stage of the offseason.
Both Barnes and Bailey spent time with the Seattle Seahawks last season. However, neither player was a member of the active roster during the season. Bailey also spent a brief stint on the Minnesota Vikings practice squad last year.
Barnes is the only one to see time in regular season games, appearing in 12 games with the New Orleans Saints in 2015. He recorded five tackles during his time with the Saints.
The United States is racing toward achieving the goals of the Clean Power Plan (CPP), even as the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia raises the prospect of a deadlocked Supreme Court ruling. Achieving CPP carbon-dioxide emissions targets 14 years ahead of schedule is now likely thanks to a remarkable confluence of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies each achieving affordability after decades of developments.

Technologies from LED lights to electric cars to heat pumps are leaping past their less-efficient successors and are poised for mass adoption. Meanwhile, plunging prices push wind turbines and now solar panels into pole position for least-cost new electric capacity. Together, the technological innovations and market shifts are drastically reducing our nation's need for coal for electric generation, and is even slicing into natural gas demand as well.
The Clean Power Plan requires a 32 percent reduction in power sector carbon-dioxide emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels. As of 2014, the latest year available, emissions had fallen 15 percent. U.S. power plant consumption of coal, the leading source of carbon dioxide targeted by the CPP, fell an additional 12 percent in 2015.
Oddly, the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts power plant coal consumption to stabilize through 2017. However, those forecasts are unreliable since EIA has long forecast renewable energy costs to be a factor of three or higher than utilities actually pay for wind or solar.
The EIA's inexplicably high forecasts of coal use also appear to neglect the five-year extension by Congress in December 2015 of tax credits for renewable energy. That extension likely will shift all new generation to renewables for years to come, with sharp declines in coal and even natural gas.
So far in 2016, year-to-date coal production is down 32 percent from 2015, more than enough to meet the CPP limit in 2030. Since most coal is used for electricity, and since wind and solar rather than natural gas are dominating new electric generation capacity, the plunge in coal production in 2015 accelerating into 2016 is almost certainly sufficient to achieve the EPA's 2030 target this year.
Achieving CPP emissions goals 14 years ahead of schedule needed no "energy miracle." Instead, a broad array of emerging and cheapening technologies is empowering these transformations in power markets.
Simply put, efficient and renewable technologies now are ready for prime-time. Taking center stage, then cleaning the whole stage are now more matters of marketing and financial engineering than electrical engineering moonshots. Waiting any longer would be like ET waiting for an iPhone to phone home.
Prices of wind, solar energy and storage technology are plummeting. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory reports that wind power cost just 2.5 cents per kilowatt hour (c/kWh) in 2014, with prices plunging further each year. Austin Energy inked a then-record low sub-4 c/kWh price for solar power last June, and Houston agreed to pay 4.8 c/kWh. EIA energy outlooks have missed these plunging prices even as other sections of the Department of Energy and the private sector report them. However, common sense can recognize that coal-laden trains from Wyoming, or even gas fracked from shale fields, will struggle to compete with direct-delivered breezes and sunshine as renewable technologies cheapen.
While Big Power pursues public-pays payouts in Ohio and anti-competitive solar penalties in Arizona and Nevada, such efforts find few fans in can-do, free market America. The American can-do spirit likewise has little time for needless fears of intermittent power. A host of storage and smart grid technologies, together with efficient lights, smart thermostats, demand response technology, and dispatchable green (geothermal, hydropower) and speckled beige (natural gas, biomass) power sources are more than sufficient to achieve balance. If countries from Costa Rica and Nicaragua to Scotland and Norway can surpass 50 percent renewable electricity, it sounds downright un-American to say "no, we can't."
The transportation sector is also set for change. Competitively priced, 200-plus mile range electric vehicles (EVs) are coming soon. Tesla is building a lithium battery Gigafactory in Nevada and promises the Model 3 for around $25,000 (post-tax credit) soon. Faraday Futures is building its own massive electric car factory nearby. The Chevy Bolt, expected to appear this year, will compete with the Volt and Prius. Plug-in hybrid Ford and Mitsubishi models will compete too for a soon-to-be-crowded electric car marketplace.
The heating and cooling industry has developed transformative technology as well. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has an energy-right heat pump plan that finances the installation of high efficiency heat pumps in homes and small businesses. Cold climate air-source heat pumps are now available and Green Mountain Power, a utility in Vermont, is selling and financing heat pumps, solar panels and energy storage units and saving their customers money.
An investment can be private and does not need to come from the federal government. The resources currently allocated toward fossil fuels are poised, instead, to be invested in the development of a 21st-century energy infrastructure run on renewable energy and balanced with digital technology and storage.
Disruptive technologies inevitably bring job losses in the disrupted industry. That's been true from buggy-whip crafters to typewriter manufacturers to coal miners. Tough as change can be, at least the shift to renewable energy will likely brighten overall employment outlooks. Nationally, solar has been adding more jobs than the oil and gas extraction and pipeline companies combined, as rooftop-by-rooftop progress takes far more labor than Earth-moving equipment. However, the geographic distribution of disruptions from distributed generation is by no means uniform; fossil-heavy states like Texas, Wyoming and North Dakota could struggle most in navigating this final fossil bust.
Just as no typewriter sale could win back a MacBook owner, the fossil industry will find itself increasingly unable to compete with renewables that now make sense for the wallet, not just for the water and air. Houston already tops all U.S. cities in green power consumption with its 75 percent green power agreement for 2016.
The utility industry, private businesses, politicians and consumers can benefit from the opportunity that this energy transformation will provide. It is an exciting prospect when realized that a renewable energy infrastructure, using existing technology, is doable today. The ongoing and unstoppable (r)evolution toward efficient and renewable energy will bring more stable and affordable prices than previous sources of energy.
Disruptive technologies disrupt. Fortunately for us, the green energy disruptions can bring about a brighter, cleaner, more affordable energy and environment, even as employment shifts toward new alternatives.

When Kai Kloepfer points his .40 caliber handgun, it fires like any other weapon. But when someone else gives it a try, it doesn't work. It's the first firearm with same built-in security as many smartphones.
Smart Guns
If the gun is picked up by an authorized user, a sensor recognizes the fingerprint and it will fire.
Guns that only work for their owners used to be the stuff of movies, like James Bond's gun in “Skyfall,” but Kloepfer thinks he has the technology to make them a reality, reports CBS News correspondent Tony Dokoupil.
“I think this could be huge. I think it could really be the future of firearms,” Kloepfer said.
He's the founder of BioFire, a start-up still headquartered in his parent's house in Boulder, Colorado. Now a freshman at MIT, Kloepfer started work on his gun as part of a science project when he was 15 years old.
“There'd be days when I'd sit down … I'd look up 14 hours later. I hadn't moved from the spot. I hadn't thought about anything else,” Kloepfer said.
He realized he couldn't stop mass shootings, but he thought he could still save lives.
After all, in one year alone, nearly 600 people died in firearm accidents. There were thousands more suicides, many committed with guns that do not belong to the victim.
“Why did it take four and a half years to put a fingerprint reader on the side of a gun?” Dokoupil asked him.
“Well, it's not as simple of a process as you might imagine,” Kloepfer said. “It's also not something anybody has ever done before.”
Kloepfer's weapon doesn't only lock like a smart phone – it charges like one.
The invention has won him some deep-pocketed allies.
“Kai is the Mark Zuckerberg of guns,” Ron Conway said.
Conway was an early investor in Google and Facebook, and now he's a putting his money behind Kloepfer's smart gun.
“What Kai has done is used all of the latest technology available us to innovate a truly authenticated gun. You couldn't do this five years ago,” Conway said.
But a push for similar guns misfired memorably in the late 1990s. A Colt prototype failed in a major demonstration, and Smith & Wesson dropped its smart gun program after resulting boycotts nearly bankrupted the company.
“What has changed from then until now to make it possible to make a smart gun like the one you're working on?” Dokoupil asked.
“I would argue pretty much everything,” Kloepfer said.
Well, almost everything.
“Good intentions don't necessarily make good inventions,” said Stephen Sanetti, president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation. They're the main trade group for companies that make and sell guns.
Sanetti expressed concern about the reliability of any firearm that depends on battery power.
“The firearm has to work. And a firearm is not the same as a cell phone,” Sanetti said. “The consequences of a cell phone not working are inconvenience. The consequences of a firearm not working could be someone's life.”
Kloepfer said his gun is “relatively reliable.”
“I know, like, when I'm using it, when I'm testing it, it functions almost every single time,” Kloepfer said.
But not every time, as we saw firsthand when Kloepfer's prototype -- a modified Glock .22 – failed.
Still, he thinks an ultra-fast and reliable final weapon isn't far off.
“I'm now to the point where… I'm able to start raising money, building a team, sort of really transitioning it to a real company, a real startup – instead of just a kid in his garage working on a science project,” Kloepfer said.
One of the big questions is whether traditional gun owners would ever buy a smart gun. The big gun lobbies say most would not.
But in a poll published last year in the American Journal of Public Health, nearly 60 percent of Americans said that if they were to purchase a new handgun, they would at least consider a smart gun.
Nearly three out of four dairy farmers have been caught breaking basic employment laws in a government crackdown.
Farmers have been told to "lift their game" after Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's (MBIE) labour inspectorate visited 44 farms, 31 of which were found to be in breach of minimum employment rights.
In one case a farmer was ordered to pay $6000 in arrears to an employee for breaching the Minimum Wage Act, the ministry said in a statement today.
Several cases remained open with the possibility of more serious enforcement action pending.
MBIE announced in November it would be visiting dairy farms throughout New Zealand between December 2013 and April 2014 to check compliance with minimum employment rights.
The visits were part of a national dairy strategy with a focus on the seasonal averaging of salaries and failure to keep accurate time and wage records.
Federated Farmers dairy chairman Willy Leferink said there was a lot of paperwork involved in employing labour but farmers needed to stay on top of it.
"Farmers are poor keepers of paperwork," he said.
"Some didn't have contracts and that sort of stuff. We don't live in the 80s any more."
In relation to seasonal averaging a lot of farmers were operating out of habit, but that was no excuse for breaking the law, he said.
"Employment is serious business so you have to treat it seriously," Leferink said.
For $60 farmers who were Federated Farmers members could get a package with all the necessary employment documentation and information, he said.
There was a grey area about how farmers should calculate minimum wages if housing was included in an employment contract, and nearly all New Zealand dairy farmers would supply housing for workers.
"It's a bit confusing because the ministry itself probably doesn't know where things are at."
MBIE central region manager Kris Metcalf said the ministry had taken enforcement action in response to the breaches, resulting in 22 enforceable undertakings and one improvement notice being issued in the crackdown.
An enforceable undertaking is a commitment by an employer to address a failure to comply with the law.
Thirteen labour inspectors took part in the exercise.
Metcalf said the next phase would focus on farms employing migrant workers.
"Farmers need to lift their game in complying with minimum employment rights and can expect a strong enforcement response from the next phase," Metcalf said.
Employers could be fined up to $10,000 for an individual and up to $20,000 for a company for failing to comply with employment laws.
Dundas Street Employment Lawyers partner Susan Hornsby-Geluk said if employers failed to complete the appropriate paper work, they could be liable for personal grievances on the basis of unjustified dismissal when a contract was terminated.
"If they engage people on the basis of a handshake, if it goes to grief they're going to be liable under the employment relations act," she said.
Hornsby-Geluk said the findings were not surprising because a lot of farmworkers were young and inexperienced in the area of employment rights and entitlements.
Smaller employers often did not have the same level of rigour around employment compliance, she said.
Italian murder trial is stopped after judge spots court staff having SEX
A judge suspended a murder trial after spotting two court staff having sex during the hearing.
Stunned Anna Ivaldi asked the prosecutor to stop speaking after she looked up and spotted the couple writhing in ecstasy in an office beside the court.
They had thought the smoked glass they were behind would mask their steamy antics, but the eagle-eyed judge could still see them.
One of the two is thought to be married, another member of staff said.
There's a time and a place: A judge suspended a murder trial after spotting two court staff having sex during the hearing at the Palazzo di Giustizia (Palace of Justice, above) in Genoa Judge Ivaldi ordered the trial in Genoa to be stopped while the two employees had their passion brought to an abrupt halt. Witnesses said prosecutor Sabrina Monteverde had just begun their summing up in the case of Moroccan born Yassin Mahmod who is accused of murdering a tramp in the Italian port city last year. A court source said:'The summing up had just begun when the judge heard strange noises, looked up and saw the outline of two naked bodies. RELATED ARTICLES Previous

An Orlando attorney who specializes in representing men in divorce cases has been charged with punching his wife and pulling her hair during a fight in his car while he was driving, according to police records.
Jeffrey Feulner, 43, who operates the Men's Divorce Law Firm, is charged with domestic violence battery, a misdemeanor. He has pleaded not guilty.
The incident happened three days before his wife, Ashlie Feulner, 41, filed for divorce.
According to a police report, Feulner was driving his wife in his Chrysler 300 near the intersection of Mills Avenue and Princeton Street on Sept. 18 when he began yelling, and she began to record their fight on her cell phone.
He snatched away the phone, and she tried to get it back, she told police.
"According to the victim, the suspect started hitting her with his hands and fists while swerving the vehicle all over the road," the report said.
He also pulled her hair so hard that some of it came loose, something confirmed by police when they found loose strands, according to the report.
Police noted that she also had a bruise and small laceration.
He was not arrested that day, but two months later, State Attorney Jeff Ashton charged him with battery, which carries a maximum sentence of one year in jail.
Feulner was ordered to appear today for a hearing, but defense attorney Hal Uhrig filed a written plea of not guilty and other paperwork. Feulner's next court date is Jan. 15.
Feulner advertises on television and billboards as a champion of men's rights in divorce and custody cases. He has been licensed to practice law in Florida for 17 years.
The couple had been married less than a year. A judge finalized their divorce on Dec. 3.
She had worked at the law firm as director of client relations, earning $11,000 in 2014, according to court records, but was fired for cause. The reason for her firing was not disclosed.
Feulner was not available for comment.
He is 6-foot-8, a foot taller than his ex-wife and outweighs her by 90 pounds, according to the police report.

When Health Canada got into the medical marijuana business, it was a small market: Just 477 people were licensed to legally buy medical marijuana in 2002, one year into the program.
But that was then. There are now 37,000 licensed users, a figure the federal government projects will grow to more than 400,000 in the next decade, all of them with access to a drug subsidized heavily by taxpayers. So, as numbers and costs mount, Ottawa is getting out of the game – switching from middleman to regulator.
Producers are rushing to get a piece of what Health Canada projects will be a $1.3-billion business by 2024, but it's a move nonetheless fraught with confusion. Current users and Canada's doctors are among those opposing it.
Story continues below advertisement
"We've been trying to fight it, but it's something they're going to push through regardless," said Marcel Gignac, 50, a medical marijuana user from Nova Scotia. Mr. Gignac has an advancing form of multiple sclerosis and has used the drug since 2008. "It was the only thing I could get to get some relief from the pain and spasms," he said.
Under the old system, licensed users could grow their own marijuana, buy from licensed small-scale home growers or buy through the government. But that program was "open to abuse," and in-home growers posed fire and public safety risks, Health Canada said in a statement this week. All those options will be off the table as of April 1.
The old system is also costly – roughly $13.8-million a year to administer, a figure set to rise with thousands of new users. The cost is due to the administrative burden – an application took 10 weeks to process – and loss from sales, with users covering only about a quarter of the government's purchase costs.
Under the new Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations, introduced in June, the government will license commercial producers, who in turn deal directly with buyers, who are required to get approval from a doctor. All Health Canada does is license and inspect the producers.
Ottawa expects its administrative costs to drop even as the industry expands. So far, 171 producers have applied, and two – Prairie Plant Systems Inc., which had been Health Canada's sole grower, and its subsidiary CanniMed Ltd. – have been approved.
In a statement, Health Minister Rona Ambrose said the new rules will boost safety, by doing away with the small-scale home grow-ops that fire officials say pose risks, while reducing government costs.
The move is the latest overhaul of drug policy by the Conservative government. This week, Ms. Ambrose blocked a bid to prescribe heroin and also made changes to ensure that cocaine, LSD, ecstasy, mushrooms and "bath salts" cannot be prescribed. Meanwhile, the government has attacked Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau's support for the legalization of marijuana. Court rulings compel the government to provide medical marijuana.

But Mr. Gignac and fellow medical marijuana users, or patients, are fighting the changes and considering a legal challenge, saying costs will soar and the quality will drop. It was cheap to grow, and the government sold it at $5 a gram. Meanwhile, CanniMed is advertising prices of $9 to $12 a gram – out of the reach, Mr. Gignac said, of many of the terminally ill users who cannot work.
Commercial sales also cannot top 150 grams per month – not enough for some users. Mr. Gignac, for instance, uses 900 grams per month. He suspects many current users will buy it on the street or continue to grow their own – both illegal after April 1. "Other patients are looking at what their other options are," he said.
Health Canada had been the gatekeeper – now, doctors will be. (Provinces are also free to allow pharmacists and nurses to prescribe marijuana.) And physicians across the country have sounded the alarm.
"We're being asked to write prescriptions, and it's akin to having a blindfold on," said Louis Hugo Francescutti, president of the Canadian Medical Association. Research into the effectiveness of marijuana is incomplete, and doctors worry they could face penalties from their regulatory bodies or from the courts, he said.
"It's rather unfortunate that the federal government dumped this problem onto the lap of physicians. I don't know if it's going to serve patients' best interest, because physicians – at least the ones I talk to – are very leery of getting involved in prescribing in marijuana," Dr. Francescutti said.

Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri on Wednesday announced the formation of an Indian branch of the militant group with the aim of spreading Islamic rule across the subcontinent and beyond.
Announcing the formation of "Al-Qaeda in the Indian subcontinent," Zawahri said the new wing would defend Muslims in Bangladesh, India and Myanmar.
"This entity was not established today but is the fruit of a blessed effort of more than two years to gather the mujahedeen in the Indian sub-continent into a single entity," he said in an online video.
Zawahri singles out three parts of India with large Muslim populations - Assam, Gujarat and Kashmir - as territories to be targeted by the new organization.
While millions of Muslims left India for what became Pakistan in 1947 - when the British partitioned the two countries at independence - tensions remain between those left behind and the Hindu majority.
Some regional flashpoints
In addition to an armed insurgency in Kashmir, which lies on the disputed border with Pakistan, there have been extremist attacks in other parts of India - most notably the Mumbai attacks on 2008, which left 166 people dead.
The 2008 Mumbai attacks caused a shock in terms of their scale, and the way they were carried out
Hundreds of Muslims died during the 2002 Gujarat riots, in violence led by Hindu extremists. India's new prime minister Narendra Modi, who was Gujarat's chief minister at the time, has long been accused of using anti-Muslim rhetoric and of doing little to halt the violence at the time. In Myanmar, the stateless Muslim Rohingya minority have been subjected to regular attacks by Buddhists.
In his video, Zawahri also renewed an oath of loyalty to Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar - apparently a snub to the "Islamic State" (IS) armed group's claim to lead transnational Islamic militancy.
Meanwhile, according to officials, booklets calling for support for IS have been distributed in Pakistan. "The booklet is in the Pashto and Dari languages," a police official told the DPA news agency.
Observers have claimed the distribution of the literature might be aimed at exploiting the weakness of local militants in the wake of a recent military offensive against them.

Collections of ants have a outstanding capability to alter shapes and duties based on the demands of their surroundings. When floodwaters hit, they self-assemble and make rafts to stay alive. They will also use their bodies to construct bridges and span gaps. What are the properties of those ant aggregations that enable for this wide selection of talents? New research from the Georgia Institute of Technology says it's because the bugs are actually liquid-like and solid-like concurrently. The research is presently published in Nature Materials.
The Georgia Tech group probed the mechanical properties of fire ant aggregations by placing thousands of ants into a rheometer, a machine used to test the solid-like and liquid-like response of materials similar to food, hand cream or melted plastic.
The ants were sheared at constant speeds from about 0.0001 rpm up to about a hundred rpm. The researchers discovered that the conduct of live ants was much like that of dead ants: when the aggregation is pressured to stream, live ants let go and play dead. In this case, the viscosity dramatically decreased as the pace increased.
“It's not unlike ketchup,” stated Alberto Fernandez-Nieves, an associate professor in the School of Physics. “The harder you squeeze, the easier it flows. However with ants, this occurs far more dramatically than with ketchup.”
“Ants seem to have an on/off switch in that they let go for sufficiently massive applied forces,” mentioned David Hu, an associate professor in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering. “Regardless of wanting to be together, they let go and behave like a fluid to stop getting injured or killed.”
This identical conduct can be seen by dropping a penny through an ant aggregation. Ants will stream around the coin as it sinks by the aggregation. This flow takes a comparatively very long time to occur. Nevertheless, when the aggregation is poked rapidly, it responds like a spring and returns to its original form.
“That is the hallmark of viscoelastic behavior,” stated Fernandez-Nieves. “The ants exhibit a springy-response when probed at brief instances, however behave fluid-like at longer occasions.”
The group quantified this by observing the ants' response to tiny wiggles of the rheometer. They discovered that the ants are equally liquid-like and solid-like. They did the identical experiment with dead ants and noticed that they are also solid-like. This confirmed that live ants are liquid-like and solid-like due to their activity.
“Remarkably, the observed behavior is comparable to what's seen in materials that aren't alive, like polymer gels right on the point after they become a gel,” stated Fernandez-Nieves. “That is quite puzzling, and we at the moment are performing many extra experiments to attempt to understand where these similarities come up from and how much they can be pushed. Doing this can hopefully extend our current mind-set about materials, that just like the ants, are active and thus out-of-equilibrium. There's far more fascinating work we plan on doing with ants.”
Hu has studied ant habits for almost 10 years. Fernandez-Nieves is a physicist who makes use of rheology to understand the mechanics of soft materials and unravel the microscopic origin of their overall properties and behaviors.
Michael Tennenbaum, a graduate research assistant who participated in the research, also compared the conduct of the ant aggregation to jello.
“Think about when you wished to make the most jello possible out of a packet of gelatin. It will be solid, but additionally very liquidy,” he stated. “That's because there would be just barely enough gelatin to make it solid-like however not enough to make it fully solid. The jello will be both solid-like and liquid-like.”
Hu has additionally used the liquid-like nature of the ants to study self-healing materials.
“In case you slice a dinner roll with a knife, you're going to end up with two pieces of bread,” said Hu. “However when you slice through a pile of ants, they'll merely let the knife go through, then reform on the opposite side. They're like liquid metal – identical to that scene in the Terminator film.”
Hu says it's this flexibility that permits ants to enjoy the best of both worlds. They are in a position to turn into solids to make things and liquids to avoid breaking into “smithereens.”

NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Believe it or not, bitcoin is reshaping how we think about foreign policy, not just economic policy. After all, in our globalized world, economic policy is foreign policy. Decisions made by the Federal Reserve have consequences for other countries, for instance. But with institutions experimenting with the cryptocurrency, it raises an intriguing question: How can bitcoin influence foreign policy?
Financing Cyberattacks
Bitcoin could be used by governments to incentivize and finance cyberattacks. A defense policy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations suggests that the U.S. should make anonymous bitcoin payments to "hacktivists" so that they train their attention on enemy groups.
On first blush, it sounds like a half-baked idea: trying to herd and guide a loose coterie of hackers towards a foreign policy goal. But the thought experiment deserves points for creativity. Implementing such an idea would require a non-profit organization, funded partly by the U.S., which makes bitcoin payments to hackers who wreak havoc on social media accounts and technology platforms that belong to the enemy.
"These paid volunteers could also harass...[the enemy]...with phishing and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks -- the bread and butter of today's online vigilantes," writes the policy expert. These hackers would want to be paid in bitcoin, which is more difficult to trace.
Of course, using bitcoin in this manner cuts both ways. Enemy states and non-state actors could also whip up legions of hackers, and pay them using bitcoin. Nevertheless, bitcoin may become part of a nation's foreign policy toolkit.
A Currency to Attract Tourists
Suffering through an economic crisis, Greece needs more revenue. Historically, tourism has provided as much as 25% of Greece's income. But because of the crisis, and despite the resulting lower prices, many tourists have canceled their trips.
To lure tourists to Greece, U.S.-based investment adviser Brian Kelly has floated bitcoin as a solution. Because of the Greek bank holiday (which is over), it was difficult for citizens and tourists to withdraw funds. He is creating a parallel currency known as Nautiluscoin, based on bitcoin technology, which he believes will calm concerns about traveling to Greece. The Greek island of Agistri will pilot the currency later this year.
Here's how it works:
1. Tourists visiting Agistri can buy items from merchants who accept Nautiluscoin;
2. Each transaction generates a fee that goes toward a fund that buys gold that stabilizes the price of the currency. A stable currency that maintains its purchasing power should attract merchants and tourists, according to Kelly.
"This currency isn't going to solve the Greek debt problem," Kelly said on a phone call. "But it will assure tourists that they can buy items without worry."
Traveling to the Holy Land has never really been on my dream to-do list. My grandparents were blessed to go there before they passed on and had a wonderful time and my dad was even recently talking about a trip, but it's never held much appeal for me. I think of it as a dry, barren place with much conflict, and while I wouldn't mind seeing the places where Jesus walked, there were just too many other beautiful places I'd rather go.
Recently, I was asked to review a new book entitled “The Holy Land: An Armchair Pilgrimage” by one of my favorite priests, Father Mitch Pacwa, S.J. Father has led almost 60 trips to Israel and is an expert on the Holy Land and its Catholic significance. I love to listen to him on Catholic Answers radio, because he is such a humble guy and he is wonderful at explaining the complexities of the Catholic faith in terms that make sense to me. So I was delighted to take a look!
As soon as I opened this book, I was entranced! It's a lovely hardcover book full of heavenly photography that gives you a wonderful sense of place. It didn't take too many pages before I realized why I should care about visiting the Holy Land: You can't truly understand the Bible without an understanding of the context in which it's written.
Don't you gloss over all the names of towns and mentions of geographical places and details when reading the Bible? I do! I thought, “Eh, that's not important, it's WHAT Jesus is saying that is important.” But after reading Fr. Mitch's book, I realized I was missing a giant component that could greatly help my comprehension of the scriptures.
Let me give you an example. In the Bible when “The Visitation” is described, it says “Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, to a city of Judea.” As we meditate on this mystery during the rosary, we should consider how Mary felt as she made this journey. You can only truly do this with a knowledge of the time and place where this occurred.
In Fr. Mitch's book, he takes you to the actual “hill country” that is referenced and explains how “hilly” it really is. Says Fr. Mitch in his book, “The climb up the driveway [to Elizabeth and Zechariah's property] is a bit strenuous, causing one woman on a pilgrimage to say, ‘You mean she came up here pregnant?'” Can you imagine Mary pregnant, riding a donkey and climbing up a hill — in haste no less? How's that for food for thought?
In his book “The Holy Land: An Armchair Pilgrimage,” Fr. Mitch leads you step by step through each geographic region of the Holy Land, taking you to all the key landmarks. In his wonderfully conversational writing, he explains the importance of each location, takes you on a verbal tour of the area and offers a prayer or a bit of scripture for reflection. Each section is also accompanied by beautiful photography so you can imagine what it's truly like to be there.
In many places, Father cleared up some facet of Catholicism I didn't understand or revealed to me some obvious connection I'd never made by explaining the geographical importance. But he's just good at that :).
This book is the next best thing to actually traveling to the Holy Land, because let's face it, for many of us, budgets just don't allow for it. Maybe someday… but this is as good a start as any. It would also make a great companion if you really are traveling to the Holy Land. You could read the scriptures at each place, learn about the location, reflect on his words and pray the prayers Father has composed.
Guess what? Now, I'm dying to travel to the Holy Land! Thanks Father Mitch :).

Rockland County remains among the state's most fiscally stressed communities, according to State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli.
With its Fiscal Stress Monitoring System, for the third consecutive year DiNapoli's office has evaluated the financial stability of local governments and has identified 70 municipalities in fiscal stress at least once during this period.
Based on their 2014 financial statements, 15 entities have received the highest designation of "significant fiscal stress." This includes the counties of Monroe, Broome, Nassau, St. Lawrence, Franklin and Rockland; the cities of Glen Cove and Albany; and the towns of East Fishkill, Jasper, Ramapo, Pierrepont, Coeymans, Cherry Valley and Parish.
In fact, Rockland is one of four counties that have been in significant stress for all three years. The others are Monroe, St. Lawrence, and Franklin counties.
Still, Rockland County officials found cause for optimism.
For the first time since the comptroller launched the statewide fiscal stress system, Rockland saw a 20-point improvement, removing the designation of New York State's most fiscally-stressed local government.
In 2014, Rockland County scored a 65.8 percent on the Comptroller's scale. That's up significantly from the 2012 and 2013 scores of 86.7 percent.
The jump was due in large part to the rebuilding of the County's fund balance and low debt service percentage, among many other factors.
"The huge reduction in our score is the result of our continued commitment to fiscal responsibility, accountability and economic improvement," said County Executive Ed Day in a written statement. "During the past 21 months, my administration has worked hard to overcome significant operational challenges and re-establish financial stability. We continue to reduce costs through consolidation and efficiency and rebuild our fund balance, while continuing to provide the critical services local residents rely on. Our aggressive efforts have been recognized by Comptroller DiNapoli and the leading credit rating companies, as we have seen our bond rating upgraded by Moody's and Standard & Poor's."
DiNapoli developed the monitoring system in 2013 to serve as an "early warning" of fiscal stress to local governments based on financial information and aspects of the external environment. A score of 65 to 100 percent indicates a significant degree of fiscal stress. A score of less than 65 percent indicates only moderate fiscal stress--and so Rockland County is less than one percentage point from being upgraded.
Rockland County Legislature Chairman Alden H. Wolfe praised the progress the county has made.
"I'm pleased that the Comptroller has recognized the significant progress the County has made in putting itself back on a strong fiscal footing," Wolfe said. "This is the result of years of hard work and tough decisions, including obtaining deficit financing and embracing a conservative approach to budgeting."
The Fiscal Stress Monitoring System looks at two main components: financial indicators, and environmental indicators:
Financial indicators evaluate budgetary solvency, the ability of a locality to generate adequate revenue to meet expenses by measuring year-end fund balances, operating deficits/surpluses, cash position and use of short-term debt for cash flow.
Environmental indicators capture trends that influence revenue-raising capability and demands for services. Those indicators include population, age, property values, employment, dependence on revenue from other government units, constitutional tax limits and sales tax revenue. The Comptroller's Office notes that these environmental factors are largely outside of a local government's control, but provide insight about the challenges confronting communities.

Splattered Flag-Themed Football Uniforms Have Many Seeing Reds
Special uniforms that Northwestern University's football team will wear on Nov. 16 have sparked controversy because of red streaks across the flag-themed patterns that look like blood to many observers.
The school and the uniform's manufacturer, Under Armour, say the design was inspired by "the appearance of a flag that has flown proudly over a long period of time." The uniforms worn by players are to be auctioned after the team's game against Michigan, with proceeds going to the Wounded Warrior Project that assists wounded veterans and their families.
Many commenters on Under Armour's Facebook page aren't accepting that explanation.
"As a father of a U.S. Marine who has shed blood in combat in Afghanistan, I find this absolutely disgusting, insensitive, and disrespectful," writes one, Scott Cooney.
"As a military spouse ... I find your uniforms insensitive, offensive and shameful. There is nothing glamorous about wearing the blood splattered by your injured or fallen comrades," writes another, Stephanie Lavezza Ferguson.
There are those who like the design. Bleacher Report columnist Jesse Reed thinks the uniforms are a "classy way to honor wounded warriors."
At Inside Northwestern, an independent website that covers the school's athletic programs, columnist Chris Johnson says that beyond the matter of whether the design is distasteful, there's also the issue of how much money will be going to the Wounded Warrior Project.
The university says 100 percent of the proceeds from sales of the game-work jerseys will go to the project. There are estimates that could come to about $100,000. But Johnson writes, "only 10 percent of proceeds from [replica] jerseys sold online will go to the foundation. That number seems a bit small to some people."
Daily Northwestern guest columnist Sean Lavery thinks Northwestern should "put its money where its mouth is and match — or double, or triple — the paltry 10 percent Under Armour is willing to part with on each jersey sale."
CNN reports that Northwestern spokesman Paul Kennedy says the school apologizes "for any misinterpretation" of the intent behind the uniforms. CNN adds that:
"Under Armour's chief spokesman, Matt Mirchin, [said] on Tuesday that the company designed the special uniforms, and both Northwestern and the Wounded Warriors Project were able to see the design and request changes. Neither did."
Under Armour has posted 18 different images of the uniforms on Facebook. (Note at 1:45 p.m. ET: It has also said "the suggestion that these uniforms are depicting streaks of blood is completely false and uninformed.")
Northwestern has put some photos on Twitter.
We've got a question (not a scientific survey of public opinion):
Update at 2 p.m. ET. Not The First Time:
It's worth noting that Under Armour has been creating special NCAA football uniforms to benefit the Wounded Warrior Project since 2009 and that red splotches have been one of the design features before — on last year's uniforms worn by Boston College and the University of Hawaii, for example. We aren't finding stories from previous years about controversies similar to this year's, though. Point us to them in the comments thread if you do.
At a California forum this year, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange spoke calmly about justice and transparency. Then he described how his group once dealt with a legal challenge.
"We crushed them like a bug," Assange said, finger wagging. The belligerence, at odds with his smooth veneer, drew a murmur from the startled listeners.
Assange is an enigma, a mirror of what people want to see: A cyber-villain, or a force for open society. Quirky and complex, he cultivates mystery.
But a look at the thinkers who influenced him, ranging from a German anarchist to American President Theodore Roosevelt, reveals a man incensed by the perceived injustices of big power and fearful of persecution.
WikiLeaks Founder Assange Due in U.K. Court

Special CBSNews.com Report: WikiLeaks
The gallery of figures who have influenced Assange, combined with his own writings, provide the intellectual playbook for a 39-year-old Australian with no fixed address who has jolted the world's most powerful country by unveiling the secrets of U.S. war logs and diplomatic cables.
He was arrested last week in a Swedish sex crimes case, and the United States asserts that he has undermined security and may have endangered people cited in the documents. Assange has said the accusations are unfounded, and that he is the victim of a politically-motivated campaign to discredit him and his organization.
His self-styled image as a lone, besieged challenger to the traditional order, one that is gaining currency in some circles, may owe much to his literary roots. Computers are his life, but so are books. George Orwell, who described the corruption of power and the lies that fuel a totalitarian vision, had a big impact. So did Kurt Vonnegut, an American author known for satire and non-conformism, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the Nobel laureate who wrote about the horror of Soviet labor camps.
"If there is a book whose feeling captures me it is 'First Circle' by Solzhenitsyn," Assange wrote in 2006. "How close the parallels to my own adventures! ... Such prosecution in youth is a defining peak experience. To know the state for what it really is! To see through that veneer the educated swear to disbelieve in but still slavishly follow with their hearts!"
As a teenager in Australia, Assange hacked into computers. He was arrested in 1991, but got off with a fine in a case that was resolved several years later. His story is believed to be documented in "Underground," a 1997 book about hackers that Assange helped to write.
Numerous media reports have identified Mendax, a hacker in the book, as Assange. In a preview of Assange's frequent travel and concern about surveillance in the months leading to his arrest last week, "Underground" describes how Mendax became increasingly fearful:
"He dreamed of footsteps crunching on the driveway gravel, of shadows in the pre-dawn darkness, of a gun-toting police squad bursting through his backdoor at 5 a.m. He dreamed of waking from a deep sleep to find several police officers standing over his bed. The dreams were very disturbing. They accentuated his growing paranoia that the police were watching him, following him."
Assange provided author Suelette Dreyfus with analysis and technical expertise to write "Underground," though she declined to discuss the identities of people in the book. She recalled that Assange was "a big fan" of Orwell's "Animal Farm," as well as Arthur Koestler's "Darkness at Noon," which is about a man imprisoned and tried for treason during the Soviet purges in the 1930s.
"It is a classic work and perhaps hit a particular chord with him as it set the scene in a fictional manner for how societies without transparency and open government can go sour," Dreyfus wrote in an email to The Associated Press.
She said that, influenced by his mother, Assange came to love the Greek classics, including Aeschylus, Euripides and Sophocles, and that he read them to his own son, Daniel, who now works in software development.
Assange "found the writing very powerful. He knew that the literature of the ancient world provided a moral lens through which to view society, and a way to explore these issues with children while also entertaining them," Dreyfus said.
"Underground" details the psychology of the hackers, describing their rivalry and nocturnal hours, the egos and compulsiveness, the personal problems of some, and the intoxicating sense of power once they had gained mastery of a network and roamed its inner structure at will. One Australian hacker group that appears in the book calls itself "The International Subversives" - Assange is believed to have been a member.
"For Julian, the emergence of the Internet in the early 90s in Australia appeared to be the opening up of the lolly shop! He was a teenager and part of a collection of kids who were fascinated by the network and fascinated by the complete lack of security on computers at the time," Geoff Huston, a computer network expert in Australia who gave evidence at Assange's prosecution in Australia in the 1990s, said in an email.
Beyond technology, Assange was developing a keen political awareness at a time of anti-nuclear activism, as well as a sense of underdog individualism reflected in his writing.
"I grew up in a Queensland country town where people spoke their minds bluntly. They distrusted big government as something that could be corrupted if not watched carefully," he wrote in a column published last week in a newspaper, The Australian.
Assange is jailed in Britain on suspicion of rape, sexual molestation and unlawful coercion in Sweden, and the case could lead to his extradition. He was arrested after Interpol put him on its most-wanted list. His supporters allege he is a victim of a dirty tricks campaign; Swedish authorities reject the idea that the case is politically motivated.
Years ago, Assange prefaced entries on a now-defunct blog with a quotation from German Gustav Landauer, an anarchist thinker who was killed by troops in Munich in 1919. Assange alleged some giant corporations amount to virtual nation states, free of accountability.
Yet he counts an American president among his influences, citing a comment by Roosevelt about destroying "invisible government," the corrupt forces in business and politics. He also gave early, unvarnished insight into his thinking on information leaks.
"The more secretive or unjust an organization is, the more leaks induce fear and paranoia in its leadership and planning coterie," Assange wrote. "Since unjust systems, by their nature induce opponents, and in many places barely have the upper hand, mass leaking leaves them exquisitely vulnerable to those who seek to replace them with more open forms of governance."
Some former colleagues have commented on an autocratic, secretive streak in Assange, who extolled activism and self-sacrifice in a lofty blog post in 2007, possibly inspired by his literary icons.
"Try as I may I cannot escape the sound of suffering," Assange wrote. "Perhaps as an old man I will take great comfort in pottering around in a lab and gently talking to students in the summer evening and will accept suffering with insouciance. But not now; men in their prime, if they have convictions are tasked to act on them."
By Associated Press Writer Christopher Torchia
ETOBICOKE, Ontario — The kids stood with their cheeks pressed up against the glass doors, gazing into one of the four rinks at the MasterCard Centre for Hockey Excellence.
“You can't go in there,” one of them snapped as a few people tried to pass through. His protection over what was on the other side of the door was with good reason: beyond that barrier skated the stars they watched every week on TV. To cross that barrier would be crossing a threshold that to these young players, gathered for a minor hockey tournament called the PlayStation Platinum Cup, was far too wide.
But in actuality, one hometown player in particular, was living proof that for these young hockey players, the NHL doesn't have to be that far away at all.
Mitch Marner, the 19-year-old Maple Leafs rookie from the Greater Toronto Area, has been dazzling the league this season with his playmaking abilities. He's been on a tear as of late, scoring 12 points in his last 11 games, including two assists in a 4-2 win over the Washington Capitals on Saturday, and he nearly added a goal to that total on an impressive breakaway chance. He's now now tied with Winnipeg's Patrik Laine for first in rookie scoring in the NHL and Marner's No. 16 jersey has increasingly joined fellow rookie and 2016 top draft pick Auston Matthews's No. 34 as commonplace outside the Air Canada Centre.
Marner grew up as a diminutive winger, constantly being told that he was too small to play professional hockey. The way he has quickly adapted to the pro game after a successful Memorial Cup-winning career with the OHL's London Knights serves as inspiration to young players throughout Toronto.
In the hockey-mad market, young players such as those on the Leaside Flames Atom A team, playing for that Platinum Cup, see Marner as living proof that not just playing in the NHL but suiting up for your hometown team is a goal that can be reached.
“They especially look upto the young players who are local to Toronto,” says Paul McHardy, one of the coaches on the Flames.
There has been a serious injection of local talent on the Leafs this season, with Toronto-area-born forwards Connor Brown, Zach Hyman and Marner all earning regular spots on the big-league club.
It is Marner who, ironically enough given his smallish size, sticks out however. McHardy says that Marner is one of the favorites among the Flames and his approach to the game has inspired a number of the young players.
“There are a couple guys on the team that don't have the biggest stature but sometimes they're out there during the games and they're the biggest grinders, working hard to go get that puck,” he says.
Marner has used his size to his advantage this season, quickly avoiding defensemen to create space and allow his linemates to find better positioning as well.
It wasn't so long ago that Marner himself was playing in similar youth tournaments. Now, he towers above the kids that play in them and has become an influence to a new generation of players looking to enter a new NHL, where speed and skill dominate oversize.
“It kind of flies by your head a little bit,” Marner said of how he has become an influence to local players so early in his NHL career. “Obviously you want to be a player that makes other kids want to play hockey.”
And not just play hockey, but play hockey in a similar vein.
McHardy gathered a collection of his players and when asked what they admired about Marner's game, their answers came quick like wildfire.
“He gets open.”
“He's young, fast and a goal-scorer.”
“He's small and he's smart.”
The answers came fast but varied. So many young players see something different and remarkable about his game.
The only consensus reached was whether Marner made them believe they could play for the Maple Leafs one day: a resounding yes.
For so long, there was a lack of local players on the Leafs. Perhaps by design, players like Marner have once again instilled a sense of local pride in the blue-and-white.
Many are surprised by how successful Marner has been in his first quarter season in the NHL. But not the man himself. As he stood in his stall at the Leafs' practice facility, while just over 200 feet away the kids waited for another glimpse of him, he offered advice on how to bridge the gap which can sometimes seem infinitely wider.
“Growing up,” he said, “there was always a lot of people always saying I was too small so you want to make sure that these kids know that, no matter what people say about you, don't stop playing the game you love.”
NOVEMBER 21--A Florida man who lives in a 55-and-over gated community called cops last week after his two cars were spray painted with the words “No Kids,” apparent neighborly retribution for his four-year-old granddaughter occasionally staying at his residence.
Bhaskar Barot, 63, resides at the Woodfield “adult community” in Vero Beach, according to an Indian River County Sheriff's Office report.
Barot told a deputy that upon departing his home last Thursday morning, he discovered that both of his Toyotas “had been spray painted with the words ‘No Kids' in yellow spray paint.” The phrase had been written multiple times on the vehicles.
An investigator spoke with “numerous neighbors,” but was unable to generate leads as to the vandal's identity. Additionally, Barot's home--and those of his neighbors--are not outfitted with security cameras.
Barot, seen at left, explained to a deputy that he “baby sits his granddaughter sometimes and people think the granddaughter lives at the location.” This impression has resulted in complaints being lodged against him with the homeowners association, Barot added.
Community rules stipulate that children are not allowed to stay at Woodfield residences for more than 30 days a year. Barot told TSG that he has not violated this rule, adding that his grandchild has never been disruptive and has only played quietly when outside the house.
Barot said that he moved to the gated community in late-2006 after undergoing heart transplant surgery. Expecting to “stay in peace,” he wondered, “Why would they pick on me?”
The gray-on-gray vandalism was categorized by sheriff's investigators as misdemeanor criminal mischief. The case has been placed in an “inactive” status since no suspects could be identified. (2 pages)
An aerial view of San Francisco. Brett Bolkowy via http://www.flickr.com/photos/brettmcd/5038229362/in/photostream/ creative commons Everyone knows that the tech gold rush in San Francisco and Silicon Valley is driving up real estate prices. But it is not until the data is visualized in a map, neighborhood by neighborhood, that you can see just how distorted the market has become through tech-driven gentrification.
The residents of Palo Alto alone appear to be living in a black hole of staggering wealth, sucking in the neighborhoods around it — all the way up to San Francisco — and driving rent prices through the roof, at least as depicted on these charts.
The poor, meanwhile, are being pushed out to Oakland and the more inconvenient suburbs. The context here is that "poor" means people earning less than $100,000. The average household income in the U.S. in 2011 was about $50,000.
We got these wonderful maps from Kwelia, a company that provides competitive intelligence on the real estate market.
This map shows median income distribution by neighborhood, with all the rich people living near Palo Alto.
Note that the median income — the middle income, basically — approaches $220,000 around Palo Alto. San Francisco is now basically a city of people whose income is around $100,000 annually. And the rich have also moved to larger houses out in the Eastern suburbs.
Kwelia
All that wealth has had a distorting effect on the local real estate market.
Rent is now over $3 per square foot around Palo Alto, but prices have really been driven up in San Francisco, where rent is now $4-$5 per square foot. That would make a small, 600-square foot apartment cost $3,000 a month.
Kwelia
This map shows the people who can, and cannot, afford to live in Silicon Valley.
People whose rent exceeds their income are show in red, and people whose income exceeds their rent in cooler green/gray colors.
Note that around Palo Alto, people's income is far greater than the rent they're paying. Yet over in Oakland, a traditionally more working class part of the Bay Area, there is a concentration of people whose rent is as much as 166% of their income. (A problem you can only solve with roommates.)

Kwelia's maps are interactive, so if you head on over to its site you can get data from individual neighborhoods, including your own.
Snøhetta, a Norwegian architecture firm, has made a dream slash nightmare I never knew I had come to life: they're building Europe's first underwater restaurant that will also function as a research center. It's called Under and I think I want to move there. I definitely want to eat there. Maybe.
Time reports that the restaurant will have three levels—a “wardrobe area” for guests, then a champagne bar, then the dining room, located on the seabed, with a 36-foot panoramic window that looks out into the North Sea. From above, the restaurant looks like a beached whale, but in a nice, architectural, Northern European way.
The walls of the restaurant are three feet thick and made of concrete, in order to sustain the choppy waters of the North Sea; that giant window that is the scariest and most exciting part of this endeavor is made of acrylic. Speaking to CNN, lead architect Rune Grasdal said “One of the benefits of this building is how it links nature and land, and how you can come safe from the land and in a very dramatic way go down through this concrete tube to the nature at sea level, and experience what normally is not experienced.”
Mr. Grasdal is correct—this is a “very dramatic way” to “experience what normally is not experienced,” but it could also be a very fascinating and fun way to die? A happy death, maybe, floating like a little sea otter amongst the kelp and the barnacles, before succumbing to lack of oxygen and the brisk cold of the North Sea, but death just the same.

Construction on Under will begin next year and the restaurant itself will open sometime in 2019. I will be there.
Given the state of the economy, there's no shortage of stories about debt-saddled landlords delaying repayment of security deposits.
Take mine. After moving to San Francisco from New York in January, my husband and I tried for months to get in touch with our landlord and get our deposit back. Good tenants, we had always paid our rent on time, including the rent for the last two months of the lease when the apartment was vacant (we didn't want a bad reference down the road), and left the apartment in perfect condition. Naturally, we expected to have no problem getting our deposit back.
But when we finally connected with the landlord at least four months later, she informed us that she simply didn't have the money to pay us back. Her excuses — that many of the apartments in her buildings were now vacant and that she was renting our old place out for much less than we paid — left us scratching our heads (wasn't she supposed to keep our money separate?) and wondering what we should do next.
Janet Portman, a lawyer and author of “Every Tenant's Legal Guide” and an e-guide on getting security deposits back, said such situations were unfortunately pretty common these days, especially for tenants whose landlords are going into foreclosure or bankruptcy and may be broke.
Still, tenants aren't without recourse. To get a security deposit back, Ms. Portman suggested first looking at what the laws in your state say about how long a landlord has to repay. Most states give landlords three to four weeks but some, like New York, give landlords a “reasonable” amount of time, generally assumed to be 30 to 60 days, as covered in this recent Real Estate Q&A. (Whether the landlords have to separate the money, put it in a bank and pay interest also varies by state.)
When landlords blow the deadline, Ms. Portman said, tenants should write them “a demand letter,” setting out all the facts, including that you paid a deposit of such and such amount, that you left owing no rent and that you left behind no damage beyond normal wear and tear. You should also mention that a reasonable amount of time has passed since you moved out and you would like your money repaid within a specified deadline. If that deadline passes, then you can take the landlord to small claims court.
In some states, like New York, you can file a complaint with the state attorney general first, before resorting to court. (Check out these other Real Estate Q&As on getting a deposit back in New York when a landlord won't respond and when a new management company takes over a building).
But what you need to weigh before going to court, Ms. Portman said, is what going after your landlord is going to cost you in terms of time, effort and money vs. the likelihood you are going to get anything back (tenants in foreclosed buildings often are repaid before many other creditors, but not without putting in a lot of time and effort). “It may end up being more expensive to go after that deposit than it's worth. Can you get blood out of a turnip?” Ms. Portman said.
In my case, according to Ms. Portman, what my landlord was doing was clearly illegal. Our story, however, has a happy ending. After the disturbing conversation with our old landlord, we touched base with a lawyer friend of ours who said he would start drafting our demand letter. Then we called the landlord to tell her we would be sending a letter soon unless she paid us the security deposit back in two installments over the next two months. The threat seemed to work, and two checks soon arrived in the mail.
If you've ever had trouble getting a security deposit back, what did you do? What tips do you have for making the process easier?

A wave of land speculators led by mainland Chinese buyers is snapping up old Burnaby rental apartment buildings, driving per door prices above $350,000 and razing the units for high-rise condominium construction.
The land rush is centred around four transit-linked Burnaby town centres where at least three dozen apartment buildings have been bought for demolition in the past year. Unlike Vancouver, Burnaby has no restrictions on tearing down low-cost rental apartments and building condominiums in their place. Last year, the suburban city issued 419 demolition permits and are averaging 34 per month so far in 2015.
“At least 95% of recent [new] condominium sales in Metrotown are by buyers of Chinese descent,” according to Ben Williams, a broker with Burnaby-based London Pacific Property Agents Inc., which specializes in assembling and selling multi-family sites. “While local developers still hold the lion's share of development in Metrotown, more recent acquisitions by Chinese developers would suggest a growing trend”. Williams,working with Bill Goold, principal of Re/Max Bill Goold Realty, have sold the majority of Burnaby's apartment buildings in the past few years.
The apartments are mostly in two and three storey wood-frame buildings that are 40 or 50 years old, with rents below the Metro Vancouver average.
According to Williams, all of the apartments deemed for development are being replaced by condominiums that will be sold to investors. “Most of these will be put back into the rental market, but they won't rent for $850,” Williams said. Generally, tenants are given one-year notice and are offered an opportunity to buy or rent in the new condo tower, he said.
According to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., the average investor condominium in Metro Vancouver rents for $1,400 per month, and the vacancy rate for rented condominiums is 0.7%, or about half that of the conventional apartment market.
Old Burnaby apartment buildings outside of the top development zones sell for around $200,000 to $220,000 per suite.
Apartment blocks must fit a certain criterion to attract big-money real estate developers. First, it must be in one of the four areas designated as town centres under Burnaby's official community plan. These are Brentwood, Metrotown, Edmonds and Lougheed, all with SkyTrain stations. The Patterson SkyTrain station area is not officially a town centre, but speculators are also bidding up multi-family sites in that area in anticipation of higher-density zoning.
The apartment site must also cover a minimum of 37,000 square feet of land to qualify for the maximum floor-space-ratio (FSR) zoning of five, or about 4.5 times the existing site coverage. Such a site could be potentially developed into 185,000 square feet of concrete strata space that could sell for $600 per square foot.
If a site is too small to qualify for maximum density, Williams and Goold will negotiate with adjacent building owners to assembly land into larger parcels.
Investors are attracted by the math. Even with per-buildable-foot prices of $120 to $140, money can be made if the condo and rental markets remain heated.
“I have 1,000 buyers looking for apartment sites,” said Goold, a specialist in multi-family sales. He said it is not uncommon to have 15 buyers lined up for an open house. “We are seeing multiple bids.”
Goold confirmed that nearly all his recent Burnaby land development sales are to investors from mainland China, which he visited last month on a successful sales trip. “One buyer from China flew over here and paid $40 million cash for a Metrotown site,” Goold said.

Negotiations on Britain's withdrawal from the EU have now begun in earnest. They are required, according to article 50, to “take account of the framework” for Britain's “future relationship with the union”. But what is that future relationship to be?
Economically, the EU comprises three elements: a free trade area; a customs union (an area with a common trade policy and a common tariff); and an internal market in which non-tariff barriers to trade (regulations, standards and the like) are harmonised and, indeed, reduced.
What the American revolution can teach us about Brexit | James Nevius Read more
Theresa May has declared that the UK will not seek to remain in the single market or the customs union. Campaigning for remaining in 2016, she said of the single market: “We would have to make concessions in order to access it; these concessions could well be about accepting EU regulations over which we would have no say, making financial contributions just as we do now, accepting free movement rules just as we do now, or quite possibly all three combined.”
Both membership of the single market and a customs agreement would require us to accept much EU legislation without being able to help formulate it – and not just existing legislation, but any legislation the EU chooses to enact in future. We would become, in effect, a satellite of the EU, relying on the European commission or other member states to defend our interests. Such an outcome – regulation without representation – proved unacceptable to Americans in the 18th century. It would probably prove equally unacceptable to the British people in the 21st.
So, when May said that Brexit means Brexit, she was merely drawing out the constitutional logic of the referendum decision. For there is no logic to a “soft” Brexit – a form of withdrawal that mimics EU membership, but without the influence that comes from membership. The ultimate choice we face is either “hard” Brexit or remain.
Britain will be negotiating, therefore, for a free trade agreement in a “hard” Brexit. But, sadly, our negotiating position may not be very powerful. If one leaves a tennis club because one does not wish to pay the subscription and does not like the rules yet still wishes to play tennis, one's leverage is not strong. One is a supplicant.
In addition, a trade agreement would probably have to be ratified unanimously by the European council, by a majority in the European parliament, and 27 national and 11 regional parliaments – and we are up against a two-year time limit. There is, apparently, a Japanese saying to the effect that the shorter the time limit, the deeper your wallet needs to be.
Some British politicians suffer from an imperial reflex, however. For them, Britain lies at the centre of the world. We only have to state our aims and other countries will be generous enough to help us achieve them. Last year Brexiteers argued that Britain should leave an EU composed of ill-intentioned foreigners whose interests were in conflict with its own. This year it has been magically transformed into a charitable institution that can be relied on to safeguard our interests.
But now we have had the general election. May called it to resolve the European question and strengthen her negotiating hand. Had she gained the landslide she hoped for, the referendum result would have been confirmed and Brexit would be assured. But the election re-opens the issue of Europe – for four reasons.
First, there is probably no Commons majority for May's version of Brexit. Indeed, there is probably a stronger representation of remain MPs in parliament today than before the election.
Second, Labour's electoral gains raise the question of whether the decision in the 2016 referendum is final: for, although Labour was not a remain party this year, the British Election Study found that the party's “soft Brexit” policy played a large part in its substantial gain in votes. In constituencies where over 55% voted remain, the party achieved a swing of around 7%. The election was the revenge of the remainers.

Third, the election intensifies internal divisions in both major parties. If the eventual deal is too “hard”, Conservative remainers may join with their opposition counterparts to defeat it; if too “soft”, Tory Eurosceptics could ensure its rejection. There may be no majority for any of the forms of Brexit on offer, with the Commons deadlocked.
Fourth, the House of Lords – in which the pro-remain Liberal Democrats and crossbenchers hold the balance of power, and the proportion of remainers is probably even higher than in the Commons – will feel emboldened to reject a hard Brexit, arguing that a minority government has no mandate for it.
With a deadlocked parliament, the possibility of an unfavourable deal and both parties so deeply divided on Europe, it may start to appear that the only way out of the impasse is a second referendum in which the government's deal is put it to the people for legitimation.
That appears unlikely at the moment. Yet a referendum on Europe appeared even more unlikely when, in 1971, Tony Benn proposed it to Labour's national executive but failed to find a seconder. James Callaghan presciently declared that for a divided party, the referendum might well prove a “rubber life raft into which the whole party may one day have to climb”. The Conservatives too may come eventually need that life raft.
Why are those who based arguments for Brexit on the will of the people now opposed to consulting the people Lord Butler
In the House of Lords on 21 February, the former cabinet secretary, Lord Butler, inquired why it was that those “who base arguments for Brexit on the will of the people are now opposed to consulting the people on the outcome of the negotiations”. When he thought he was going to lose in 2016, Nigel Farage said that a further referendum would be needed: there is no doubt that Brexiteers would have continued their campaign to take Britain out of the EU and they would have had every democratic right to do so. But so equally do those who have doubts about the decision.
Brexit after all raises fundamental, indeed existential, issues for the future of the country. That is why the final deal needs the consent not only of parliament, but of a sovereign people.

Who is Cheng Wei, the man who defeated Uber's Travis Kalanick in China? The 33-year-old founder of ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing Technology Co. keeps a quieter profile than many of his fellow tech entrepreneurs. Yet an old blog titled “With the Wind” that Mr. Cheng wrote in his pre-fame years provides insight into one of China's new business stars.
He never counted on Didi's massive success
In his first blog post after founding Didi in the summer of 2012, Mr. Cheng gave a sober assessment of his startup's chances.
“The likelihood of success for entrepreneurs is extremely small, while failure is inevitable. We see the brilliance of the extreme few who succeed, but we don't see the bleakness and desolation of the countless numbers who fail.”
He wrote that back in 2004, Chinese startups survived on average 3.7 years, and that the number dropped to 2.9 years by 2011. Mr. Cheng concluded that for a startup to have a chance of success, it needed to catch a rising industry wave the way Chinese smartphone-maker Xiaomi did.
What he did in the weeks before founding Didi
Mr. Cheng's last two blogs before Didi was founded were posted on April 6, 2012 and recounted the simple life in his hometown in Jiangxi. He wrote about spending the morning helping his mother pick out a new smartphone to replace her four-year old handset.
“When I think of my mom using it, with its pink flip cover, I'm full of happiness.”
He then spent the afternoon sitting at a local Buddhist temple reading a book from his grandfather's collection and quoted some classical Chinese verse about cherishing the things around you.
Reading
Mr. Cheng is a voracious reader. He wrote in 2011 that he had developed a habit of finding a quiet corner in the same bookstore to curl up in on Sundays, with a book and a cup of tea. In Oct. 2011, he wrote about enjoying his “only big vacation in all these years” by staying at home with family and devouring the 10-volume, 1.2 million-word fantasy adventure series “The Tibet Code” by Chinese author He Ma. The popular novels follow an expert on Tibetan Mastiffs who gets drawn into the intrigues of ancient Tibet. (Later when Mr. Cheng was seeking to convince high-profile banker Jean Liu to join Didi, he took her on an impromptu road trip in remote Tibet with his team.)
Philosophy
Over the years, Mr. Cheng grappled on his blog with questions like, what is the root of happiness, and what is most important in life? In one post in 2011, he recounted his musings on happiness while walking to work in the morning in Beijing.
“One can practice turning off the brain and opening the soul to enter another state. This is perhaps why on this familiar road, I can experience beauty today.”
In 2008, he recalled a conversation with a friend on why the shoulder is the most important part of the body.
“The most important thing in the world is not to gain anything, but to provide friends and family a shoulder to lean on when their heart is in pain.”
The Alibaba years
Mr. Cheng worked at Alibaba for most of the four years covered in the blog. His work during this period was low-key, but he approached it with seriousness and devotion. One major project that Mr. Cheng was in charge of was the launch of an Alibaba subsidiary in the northern Chinese city Langfang in 2008, an event timed to coincide with an international furniture expo. After weeks of preparation, the launch went off without a hitch, with one exception: they had purchased expensive “Brazilian rainbow butterflies” to release into the air as live confetti. To Mr. Cheng's dismay, dozens of the butterflies ended up crushed underfoot by reporters in the conference room.
Ideas on management
Much of Mr. Cheng's blog is devoted to management strategy, often with military analogies. “Training alone won't make employees grow up,” he wrote in 2010.
“Generals can only be created on the battlefield, not in the military school.”
He posted a list of principles of good sales management, including, “The job of a sales manager is to create an environment where sales people are ‘forced to succeed.'” Mr. Cheng also reposted speeches from executives such as Alibaba founder Jack Ma, Baidu's Robin Li and Microsoft's Bill Gates. After climbing the Great Wall one time, he wrote about the importance of teamwork – a lesson he used in his delegation of powers at Didi:
“One person can walk fast, but only a group of people can last long.”
Food
Mr. Cheng's blog chronicles many meals of simple fare, especially in his earlier years. His birthday dinner from 2008 (“It's been so long since I celebrated a birthday, maybe three years, maybe four”) shows a home-style meal of a few stir-fried dishes and rice. That year, he had moved to Langfang as an Alibaba sales manager. Soon after the move, he wrote about walking around in the morning in search of breakfast and finding only an instant-noodle vendor. A few weeks later, the breakfast situation had improved: Mr. Cheng posted photos of steamed bread with sides of scrambled eggs and boiled eggs.
“Our breakfast is simple but cozy. I will never eat instant noodles again!”

Tel-Aviv based decentralized tech stack development company, Synereo has announced that it will be releasing the Alpha phase of decentralised social network in September. The company claims that this development will allow web applications to exist without centralized servers.
The announcement reads:
“Synereo's decentralized, open-source social network will move into alpha this September, being the first fully decentralized network based on principles of the attention economy. Synereo's alpha is built on top of the company's unique distributed tech stack, which utilizes novel Blockchain technology to enable a peer-to-peer internet.”
How this model will compete with already existing centralised platforms like Facebook and Twitter remains to be seen.
What is decentralised social network?
Analysing this development Anari Sengbe, Founder of ProducTank, predicts that the future of social networks lies in decentralised platforms.
He says that eventually if not one service like Synereo, a collective of decentralized social networks will start chipping away at services like Facebook. However, Sengbe expresses his reservations about the nomenclature of Synereo. “I don't know who's going to be able to spell that,” he notes.
Sengbe concludes:
“Nevertheless, decentralized social networks are going to become the norm, based on the reward incentives they will work. Think about it, at some point a generation grew up without myspace we our generation was thinking myspace is the coolest thing ever. A generation is starting that may never use facebook because they can't understand the concept of feel good likes over monetary likes.”
Decentralisation and user privacy
Synereo claims that its blockchain-based social network will revolutionize the concept of social media by placing control over content, personal information and monetization in the hands of users.
It also says that contrary to incumbent social media providers, its social network cannot record or store personal information of any kind, and does not sell it to third parties, or target users with marketing messages.
Instead, all network transactions and relations are encrypted on a distributed ledger and accessible to permitted parties only.
Ability to adapt with the industry
Dor Konforty, CEO of Synereo, while speaking to Cointelegraph adds that due to how dynamic the social media industry has become, his company have already mapped out plans to improve their creation as time goes on.
He mentions the aspects that accommodate innovation along the way such as the open source nature of the model which would increase the number of people reviewing & working on it.
Also he notes that the decentralized/distributed characteristic means that information coming from the leading edges of the network has a more direct connection to the decision making process.
Konforty explains:
Ontario's Progressive Conservatives raised more than $16.1-million through political donations in 2016, a record haul that far outstripped the governing Liberals as the parties prepare for next year's election.
Kathleen Wynne and the long-governing Liberal Party's once-powerful fundraising machine raised $6.5-million last year, the second-lowest since Ms. Wynne became Premier in 2013. The total included proceeds of $1,000-a-plate fundraisers, which have now been outlawed.
In contrast, Patrick Brown spent his first full year as leader attending hundreds of events both big and small to eliminate the Official Opposition's $6.1-million debt and exceed the PCs' overall $11-million fundraising goal, according to discussions with party officials and financial documents provided to The Globe and Mail. The war chest will be needed to finance everything from expensive television advertising to pins with Mr. Brown's name on them as he takes to the road in the summer 2018 in a campaign to unseat Ms. Wynne's government. However, the money they now have in the bank also allows the Tories to reach voters before they must comply with Ontario's campaign spending limits, which restrict parties to $1-million in advertising during the six months before an election.

The money will allow the party to mount "a proper campaign," according to Walied Soliman, a member of Mr. Brown's inner circle.
Robert MacDermid, a political science professor at York University who looks closely at party fundraising, said the gap between the parties' totals is "unusually large." It is the first time the Opposition has raised more than the Liberals since 2011, according to data from Elections Ontario.
"Typically, the governing party out-fundraises the opposition in any given year, even when they are unpopular," Prof. MacDermid said.
Part of the haul could be attributed to the fact that campaign finance reforms were coming that would clamp down on cash-for-access fundraising, end corporate and union donations and impose tighter caps on contributions. The new rules took effect on Jan. 1, 2017.
In the year before a change of campaign-finance legislation at the federal level in the mid-2000s, some of the major parties doubled their fundraising in an effort to get money from corporate and union donors under the old rules, Prof. MacDermid noted.
"It's not unusual to have an orgy of money come in before new rules, but this is unusually high," he said.
The Liberals also cited the coming new rules as an explanation for the party's drop in fundraising last year. While the Liberals raised about $10.8-million in 2015, according to data from Elections Ontario, that fell to almost $6.5-million last year, the party told The Globe.

"Premier Kathleen Wynne and our party believed the way politics were done in Ontario needed to change," party spokeswoman Patricia Favre said, noting that is why Ms. Wynne told Liberal MPPs to stop holding small-scale, private fundraisers, and to post all events online. "Now with the new fundraising rules in place, we look forward to continuing to engage with Ontarians and party members interested in playing a role in Ontario's democratic process."
With an end to cash-for-access fundraisers, politicians have to work harder to raise money, attending more events where they pass the hat among supporters. A donor who could give nearly $30,000 to parties, candidates and constituencies before 2017 is now limited to $1,200 to a political party, $1,200 to constituencies and $1,200 to candidates – an effective limit of $3,600 per year.
The Ontario NDP raised just over $4.1-million, according to Karla Webber-Gallagher, the party's provincial secretary. "We feel really good about it. We definitely exceeded the target we set for ourselves," she said.
While polls continue to show that Ontarians are unfamiliar with Mr. Brown, who is from Barrie, as both a leader and politician, party officials say he was almost solely responsible for the fundraising total. Mr. Soliman, a prominent Bay Street lawyer and Mr. Brown's campaign chair for 2018, said the leader made the plan, which set a gruelling fundraising schedule for himself.
"I wish I could tell you that there was this incredible team of people lead by some incredible individual," Mr. Soliman said. "The truth is that it was Patrick Brown sitting down and saying, 'Where can I raise the funds necessary to ensure that our message is delivered to the people of Ontario.' He did that. He literally worked morning, afternoon and night, meeting people and making sure that they understood his message."
The PCs surpassed the revenue target because of grassroots fundraisers and corporate donors, said Tony Miele, chairman of the PC Ontario Fund, which manages the party's money.

"It's our party's best year ever," he said."... In my entire career, I've never seen anything like this."
The Tories say the money they raised in 2016 was not just from big corporate cheques and the Bay Street crowd, but came from 18,022 contributors. Along with small online donations, Mr. Brown attended hundreds of fundraising events, from small-town barbeques to meetings with supporters in a hall.
The party has more than 100,000 members, Mr. Soliman said. While the party has taken a strong line against Ms. Wynne, leaders say that the message to donors is about Mr. Brown's preparedness for the premier's office as much as it is about Liberal failings.

DemocracyForNewHampshire.com — Speech to the NH House on Impeachment resolution
Editor's note: Representative Hall's speech on the House floor last week is posted here in its entirety. Unfortunately, her colleagues never heard the whole speech, because she was interrupted by hoots and howls, and because the Speaker of the House also interrupted her. NH Secretary Gardner reminded us all at DemocracyFest that, according to our first President, George Washington, democracy demands that we “extend our views beyond ourselves”. Thank you Representative Hall, for the attempt to do just that. And shame on your colleagues for not honoring your patriotism and for preventing you from doing so.
Why now? Why NOW? That's the question I have been asked constantly since I made the request for late introduction of a Resolution to Petition the U.S. House of Representatives to Commence Impeachment Procedures. I based this request to our Rules Committee on House Rules which specifically provide for late introduction after the deadline if approved by the House Rules Committee or a 2/3 vote of the House. The Rules Committee in its wisdom voted (and I understand their reasoning) not to allow the introduction and I am before you today asking this House in its wisdom to allow the introduction of this resolution. The resolution I will propose if this motion passes have been drafted by me and is based on the resolution introduced by Representative Perry at the Democratic State Convention in June of 2006. It passed overwhelmingly even though the Resolutions Committee of the Convention in their wisdom did NOT recommend it.
Impeachment Resolutions have been introduced in this House before. I was a member of this House when President Nixon was facing the impeachment and Franklin mayor and House colleague, Eugene Danielle introduced an impeachment resolution. It was one of the first to be introduced in the country and Danielle gave an impassioned speech. I wish I was the orator he was.
I have talked with at least three members of this House today who were members then and they remember that speech. It was a very rousing speech and at the end of the speech we had a standing vote. Some remember 11 courageous people stood up and voted for the resolution. I was very moved but I failed to stand up. At least one member today who was a member then stood up. I have always been ashamed that I did not stand. I believe we HAVE TO STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT, NOT WHAT IS WINNABLE. This is why I believe so strongly NOW is the time to stand up. At least ten other legislatures are reportedly considering the urgency of acting now. I believe there is a compelling need to start the ball rolling NOW. Waiting for the regular process which has been urged by many I respect will put the schedule behind by six months. The people are angry””they want action now. They are angry with Congress as well. The polls affirm this conclusion. They are angry because we are not moving fast enough to stop the Iraq war. Because the war puts our finest young soldiers in harms way, many of our grassroots people have concluded that Congress and the Military, and our Chief Executives have failed in all the arenas listed in the Resolution to Petition Congress. They are afraid that our Chief Executives are still leading us down the path of shock and awe, lies, and deadly assault. Our wonderful troops are being unfairly strained already. How can we sustain a broadening of the conflict to another country? Iran is an absolutely pressing concern, today, tomorrow, the next day. Can we really afford the same mistakes in Iran?
Everything I understand by reading the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution sets forth principles by which we the people must act when a situation develops such as we face at this momentous moment. We have a failure of leadership. I mean ALL leadership. Both parties and the three branches of government bear responsibility. Each citizen bears the responsibility also. If citizens fail to act we are just as doomed as the Germans were when Hitler was allowed to come to power. They let it happen. I know because I was there.
When all else fails, the Constitution provides for impeachment and removal from office. Republicans thought that point of failure happened and impeached President Clinton, and my party thought that happened and both parties forced the resignation of President Nixon when it becomes obvious he would be impeached. Frankly, I would prefer resignations rather than impeachments as a result of this resolution. No one wants to go through the gut wrenching of impeachment and trial. I want new leadership immediately. Resignations would be the fastest and best. Nobody thought Nixon would resign, but he did.
I think even worse could happen were impeachment not introduced because that could set a precedent for future generations and future presidents. Would you want any one of the Democratic Presidential hopefuls to have the power to do what President Bush and Vice President Cheney have done? Would you want any one of them to commit any of the impeachable offenses listed below, and not be held accountable? Would I want any one of your hopefuls to carry on the offenses into the next term? Even if you yourself don't think the offenses are impeachable, aren't they serious enough to find out through investigation and testimony?
I think we need to have this discourse once again to purge our system when it goes as far awry as I think it has. I think the sooner the discourse starts, the sooner we can start saving lives. Even if it were to start Wednesday, there is no assurance where it will go, and if it doesn't start until September, there will still be no assurances. But history teaches us that the American people will not ignore our Constitution and Declaration of Independence.
Story highlights The remote Cleveland Volcano is about 940 miles southwest of Anchorage
The USGS raised its alert Thursday for the volcano to the third highest of four levels
That follows the detection of an ash cloud after what's likely a "single explosion"
A heightened state of alert has been issued for a remote Alaskan volcano after the detection of a drifting ash cloud, the result of what's believed to have been a lone explosion.
The U.S. Geological Survey put out an orange alert Thursday for Cleveland Volcano in the Aleutian Islands, about 940 miles southwest of Anchorage. That is third out of four possible levels on the federal agency's warning scale.
"Satellite data indicate that this is a single explosion event," the survey and Alaska Volcano Observatory said in its notice, but "more sudden explosions producing ash could occur with plumes exceeding 20,000 feet above sea level,"
A similar alert had been issued in early September, amid concerns that the volcano could be leaking from its flanks if the lava inside continued to build up. The volcano's lava dome was 262 feet in diameter on August 30, but by then in had expanded to 394 feet.
That warning was downgraded to yellow on November 3.
According to the observatory, satellites spotted a "detached drifting ash cloud" some 15,000 feet above sea level around 7 a.m. (1 p.m. ET) and moving east-southeast.
Situated 45 miles west of Nikolski by the Bering Sea, the Cleveland volcano makes up the western half of uninhabited Chuginadak Island.
Its last, most significant eruption came in February 2001, when three explosions created ash clouds that soared as high as 39,000 feet and spurred a hot avalanche that reached the water. Smaller ash emissions were detected in January, and before that in June 2009, the observatory said.
Cleveland is one of over 130 volcanoes and volcanic fields that have been discovered in Alaska. About 90 of these have been active over the past 10,000 years, including more than 50 since the mid-18th century, according to the observatory. Roughly three-quarters of all active U.S. volcanoes to erupt in the past two centuries have been in Alaska.

Dharamsala, January 19
Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh on Thursday formally declared Dharamsala, situated in the majestic Dhauladhar range, as the second capital of Himachal Pradesh.
Camping in the city on his winter sojourn, the chief minister said Dharamsala has significance and history of its own and fully deserved to be the second capital of the state.
(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)
He said the city held special importance and value in the lower areas of the state, including Kangra, Chamba, Hamirpur and Una districts.
The people of these areas would now benefit because of this special status and they would not have to travel to Shimla for their work.
He said Dharamsala was already marked prominently not only in the map of India but of the world due to its significance, including religious, and adventure tourism.
Terming Dharamsala the home of the Dalai Lama, which attracted people from across the world, he said prominent personalities of the world visited this hill town throughout the year.
Virbhadra said a full-fledged winter session of the Vidhan Sabha was held for the first time outside Shimla in December, 2005.
A complete Vidhan Sabha Bhawan was already working at Tapovan, for which the foundation was laid in his last tenure in 2006. This town had already been a witness of holding 12 winter sessions of Vidhan Sabha.
Virbhadra said that it was he, who introduced the practice of annual winter sojourn way back in 1994, to hear the people and see for himself the progress of development works being carried out in the area.
As many as 694 cases of paid news – or news for which the media organisations took money to publish or broadcast – were detected by the Election Commission in this election, official said.
By the time the 10 phases of the polls ended to form the 16th parliament on May 12, thousands of cases of paid news were reported, according to EC officials. In 3,053 cases, notice was issued by the EC suspecting a foul play, an official said.
"We served 3,053 notices, 694 of which were found to be genuine cases of paid news by our Media Certification and Monitoring Committee," EC Director General Akshay Rout told IANS. "We define paid news as those items which are published as news but are advertisement in nature," he added.
"There is no accountability in the media. While some candidates willingly pay for positive coverage, in most other cases candidates have to pay to prevent negative coverage. The media is getting increasingly criminalised, and acting as extortionist," noted columnist and commentator Swapan Das Gupta told IANS. He added that media is acting as a reckless body, violating every known tenet of ethics.
But the Press Council of India said it had not received any intimation from the election authority in this regard. "We have not received any formal report or communication from the ECI over cases of paid news. Let it come, then we will be able to review it and act over it," Punam Sibbal, deputy secretary of the Press Council of India, told IANS.
The Election Commission, on the other hand, said it was not obliged to act against the TV news channels or print media indulging in such practices. "The media houses or publications are beyond the EC's purview. We simply forward the cases of paid news to the PCI and the News Broadcasting Standards Association," Dhirendra Ojha, Director in the EC, told IANS.

New study links glyphosate use with celiac disease and gluten intolerance
Celiac disease and gluten intolerance are on the rise worldwide, and that rise has taken place in parallel with the increased use of glyphosate herbicide, shows a new peer-reviewed paper from Anthony Samsel and Stephanie Seneff.
It's good to see some of Dr Nancy's Swanson's striking graphs correlating glyphosate use in the US to the rising incidence of modern diseases appearing in this peer-reviewed publication.

Glyphosate, pathways to modern diseases II: Celiac sprue and gluten intolerance
Anthony SAMSEL and Stephanie SENEFF
Interdiscip Toxicol. 2013; Vol. 6(4): 159–184. doi: 10.2478/intox-2013-0026
Full paper available at: http://nhrighttoknowgmo.org/BreakingNews/Glyphosate_II_Samsel-Seneff.pdf
ABSTRACT
Celiac disease, and, more generally, gluten intolerance, is a growing problem worldwide, but especially in North America and Europe, where an estimated 5% of the population now suffers from it. Symptoms include nausea, diarrhea, skin rashes, macrocytic anemia and depression. It is a multifactorial disease associated with numerous nutritional deficiencies as well as reproductive issues and increased risk to thyroid disease, kidney failure, and cancer. Here, we propose that glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide, Roundup®, is the most important causal factor in this epidemic. Fish exposed to glyphosate develop digestive problems that are reminiscent of celiac disease. Celiac disease is associated with imbalances in gut bacteria that can be fully explained by the known effects of glyphosate on gut bacteria. Characteristics of celiac disease point to impairment in much cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are involved with detoxifying environmental toxins, activating vitamin D3, catabolizing vitamin A, and maintaining bile acid production and sulfate supplies to the gut. Glyphosate is known to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes. Deficiencies in iron, cobalt, molybdenum, copper, and other rare metals associated with celiac disease can be attributed to glyphosate's strong ability to chelate these elements. Deficiencies in tryptophan, tyrosine, methionine, and selenomethionine associated with celiac disease match glyphosate's known depletion of these amino acids. Celiac disease patients have an increased risk to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which has also been implicated in glyphosate exposure. Reproductive issues associated with celiac disease, such as infertility, miscarriages, and birth defects, can also be explained by glyphosate. Glyphosate residues in wheat and other crops are likely increasing recently due to the growing practice of crop desiccation just prior to the harvest. We argue that the practice of “ripening” sugar cane with glyphosate may explain the recent surge in kidney failure among agricultural workers in Central America. We conclude with a plea to governments to reconsider policies regarding the safety of glyphosate residues in foods.
Are you making your life harder than it needs to be?
1.) You Try To Make Everyone Happy
Keeping other people's feelings in mind is a positive quality, but bending over backwards to put others' happiness above your own is exhausting and impossible. Whether it's deciding what to serve at your dinner party, where to get married or what career path you head down, there will always be someone who will not be pleased.
It's hard to let someone down, and natural to avoid conflict, but placing too much focus on making everyone else happy comes at the cost of your own. Think of it like the airplane instructions of putting your oxygen mask on first before assisting someone else. If your priorities aren't taken care of, you aren't in the optimal position to do anything productive.
For example, if you choose the college major your parents are pushing for over what your passion is, your college experience will be a let down. You won't be excited about your classes, and most likely not do as well as you could. When you graduate you're all set..for a career path you don't want to be on.
Instead, ask yourself if this decision affects you, or for the other person/people the most. If you're planning your birthday dinner, your opinion is what matters, but if you're planning your parents' anniversary party, they are the focus and bear the opinions that should hold weight.
2.) You Worry About What Others Think
On some level, you're always going to worry about what others think. Hey, it's embarrassing to trip in public no matter how comfortable you are being you! But when the worry over what someone thinks of you, limits you from from living as your authentic self, life is not going to be easy.
I am a homebody. I like going out, and love planning theme nights with friends, but I have many introvert tendencies and am perfectly happy spending a weekend night at home with a show and a book. Years ago I did worry what I “should” want to do. What would my friends think when I declined a night out in favor of sweatpants and a chick flick? I'm young, I should
Years ago I did worry what I “should” want to do. What would my friends think when I declined a night out in favor of sweatpants and a chick flick? I'm young, I should want to go to a club! Sometimes I would suck it up and go, only to have a “meh” time and need time to myself the next day to recharge. Maybe it's growing up, but I have completely stopped caring what people think of my choices.
If your heart knows what it wants and you don't follow through because someone might think it's silly, your life will be unfulfilled. Stay strong in your decisions and be your biggest advocate. The next time you find yourself preoccupied with what others think, ask yourself, “what's the worst that will happen?” Will you lose friendships if you opt out of a night on the town? I highly doubt it. Will someone laugh at you when you try the weight room for the first time? I have never seen this happen. The more often you push past the uncomfortable feeling that others are judging you, the easier it gets to stay true to yourself.

3.) You Accept Only Perfection
“Imperfect action beats perfect inaction every time.” – Harry Truman
How many projects have you left undone because it wasn't coming out exactly like you pictured? How many things have you not attempted because you don't feel you'd excel?
I see this all the time with my clients in their exercise habits. They want to get an hour workout in, but the day gets in the way and they can only get in 20 minutes so they don't do anything. Let me tell you, a 20 minute workout is 100% more effective than NO workout!
Waiting for perfection; the perfect time, the perfect opportunity, the perfect conditions, will never produce results and causes unnecessary pressure on yourself.
It's one thing to hold yourself to high standards, but punishing yourself for not being perfect directly affects your self-confidence and is an impossible threshold to maintain.
Try focusing on doing the best you can do at the time. Practice truly does make perfect, but you won't reach perfection if you don't put in the practice time.
4.) You Do Everything On Your Own
It's empowering to figure things out on your own, to have a hand in every aspect of a project, but it makes for a tough time.
Learning how to delegate will give you ownership of your time. Effectively delegating isn't pushing off work onto someone else. It's recognizing your strengths and the strengths of those around you, leveraging everyone's time and skills competently.
Learning from mentors is another way to avoid this common pitfall. When I first started my business, I had the fundamental knowledge of coaching, but I lacked business and marketing experience. So I went on Linked In and messaged a few female coaches in Chicago. I met for coffee and asked questions about starting out and any advice they were willing to share.
Don't waste time and energy reinventing the wheel. Ask for help, learn from those around you and make real strides in less time.
5.) You Hold On To Anger
“Holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.” – Buddha
Being angry take effort, and holding on to grudges is incredibly taxing on your mental and physical state.
“Unresolved anger issues lead to anxiety, which can have long-term effects on your life…Long-term anxiety can pose dangerous risks to your physical and emotional states. Individuals who suffer from long bouts of anxiety can be at a greater risk for strokes. Serious memory loss, chronic sleep disorders and relationship issues can also develop.” –Psychguides.com
It's OK to get angry, it's a natural emotion and when handled correctly is a sign of emotional health. However, when everyday occurrences set you off or you find yourself dwelling on past discretions, it's time to let go.
Allow yourself to be angry, but recognize what's done is done and move on. Try learning something positive from whatever has made you upset – a friend is always late? Tell them events start 20 minutes before they really do – and close the door.
Despite how we sometimes feel, life doesn't have to be as hard as we make it. It is – however – short. So make it work for you and focus on having the best experience you possibly can.
COLUMBUS (WCMH) -- For the second day in a row all Columbus City Schools will dismiss early due to high temperatures.
Columbus City Schools spokesperson Scott Varner said all schools will dismiss early on Tuesday, Sept. 26. All high school and middle school students will be dismissed at 12pm. All elementary, K-6 and K-8 schools will be dismissed at 1pm.
The schools will serve lunch for all students before the early dismissal.
"Yesterday went very, very well. I was impressed with not only our faculty and staff, but our parents and guardians in this community. They step right up in situations like this, and we had very few students who weren't met when they returned home or were dropped off on their bus yesterday," said Columbus City Schools Superintendent Dan Good.
All afternoon buses will complete their normal routes about 2.5 hours earlier than usual. Parents need to make plans to meet their children at the bus stop or make alternative plans for picking their children up from school.
"I like that kids are getting out because teachers want to be in a position where kids are focused," said Octavia Matthews, a parent of a Winterset Elementary student. "They are not focused when they are hot."
High school sports and activities will continue as scheduled, but middle school activities and sports practices are canceled. Latchkey will remain open and welcome students at 1pm.
"We once again refreshed all of our coaches with the heat acclimation, Ohio High School Athletic Association's program for addressing our student athletes during hot weather like this. So they're prepared to enact that today and so we will have all of our after-school activities for high schools occur today," said Good.
All teachers and other staff will remain at the schools for the full day.
Right now more than 40 CCS schools are without central air in its buildings. To keep cool on hot days, teachers are giving out cold water bottles to students, running fans and limiting the amount of time students spend outside.
"We know that things come up, and so we have an alternative plan," said Dan Good. "So students that are either fearful of going home or may not have someone to meet will remain at the schools and our faculty and staff will be here for their regular workday, so there'll be supervision and activities planned for those children."
For any more information, families are asked to call (614) 365-8888.
The family of Otto Warmbier said Wednesday they are "adjusting to a different reality" following their son's return from North Korea, where he was "brutalized" by his captors and held for more than a year in a coma -- the cause of which is still unknown.
"Otto is not in great shape right now," his father, Fred Warmbier, told Fox News' Tucker Carlson in an exclusive interview Wednesday afternoon from his Cincinnati home. "Otto has been terrorized and brutalized for 18 months by a pariah regime in North Korea."
North Korea, for its part, said Thursday that it released Warmbier "on humanitarian grounds" after he had been held prisoner for 17 months, state news reported.
The 22-year-old college student was medically evacuated from North Korea and flown to a hospital in his hometown of Cincinnati late Tuesday following a brief flurry of diplomatic activity that involved the highest levels of U.S. government.
The elder Warmbier singled out Joseph Yun, the U.S. special envoy on North Korea, as a key player in his son's release as well as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and President Trump.
"They wanted Otto home," Warmbier said. "Cindy and I believe they made this happen."
Warmbier's interview will air in full Thursday night on “Tucker Carlson Tonight at 8 p.m. ET.
Wambier said he did not yet know what happened to his son during his 18 month-long imprisonment.
Doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center are evaluating Warmbier, who was admitted Tuesday night in a coma, according to his family.
Warmbier, a University of Virginia student, was detained on Jan. 2, 2016, at Pyongyang International Airport, while visiting the country as a tourist with Young Pioneer Tours. He was charged with stealing the sign from a staff-only floor in the Yanggakdo International Hotel in Pyongyang and committing “crimes against the state.” He was given a one-hour trial in March 2016, when the government presented fingerprints, CCTV footage and pictures of a political banner to make its case against the American student.
“I beg that you see how I am only human,” Warmbier said at his trial. “And how I have made the biggest mistake of my life.”
Despite his pleas, the college student was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. In a post-trial video released to the world, Warmbier, under obvious duress, praised his captors for his treatment and for handling of the case “fair and square."
The next day, he slipped into a coma, his father said.
"The day after he was sentenced, he went into a coma," Warmbier told Fox News, saying the family was shocked when they learned of Otto's condition in a phone call from Yun on Tuesday of last week.
A U.S. official told Fox News that Warmbier was in a coma for "over a year." The official added that the North Koreans told the U.S. that Warmbier contracted botulism and slipped into a coma after taking a sleeping pill. Neither the family nor doctors treating Warmbier have commented on that claim.
Sherri Kirk, a spokesman for UC Medical Center, said Wednesday she had no updates on Otto's condition. A press conference is scheduled for 10 a.m. Thursday.
In Wyoming, Ohio, a Cincinnati suburb, friends and neighbors of Warmbier said they were elated the young man was home but expressed grave concern over his condition.
"We're very concerned for his health and future," said neighbor Tom Purdy. "We hope he can return to normal. We've been praying for him every night."
At Wyoming High School, where Warmbier attended, students described him as an "outstanding person" who was known in the community for his academic achievements and athleticism.
Foreigners who have been detained or imprisoned in the Hermit Kingdom often have a shared experience: confusion, forced confessions, communication blackouts and isolation.
Warmbier's release leaves three U.S. citizens currently known to be held in North Korea: accounting professor Kim Sang Duk, businessman Kim Dong Chul and Kim Hak-Song, who worked at Pyongyang University.
When asked what advice he might have for their families, Warmbier said he had none.
"I wouldn't know what to say to them," he said. "This is, I've been told, not precedented."

"FEPA" redirects here. For the integral bacterial outer membrane porin protein, see FepA
The United States Family Entertainment Protection Act (FEPA) was a bill introduced by Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY), and co-sponsored by Senators Joe Lieberman (D-CT), Tim Johnson (D-SD) and Evan Bayh (D-IN) on November 29, 2005. The bill called for a federal mandate enforcement of the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) ratings system for video games in order to protect children from inappropriate content.[1]
The FEPA would have imposed fines of US$1000 or 100 hours of community service for a first time offense of selling a "Mature" or "Adult-Only" rated video game to a minor, and $5000 or 500 hours for each subsequent offense. The bill also called for a FTC investigation into the ESRB to ascertain whether they have been properly rating games.[2]
Similar bills have been passed in some U.S. states such as California, Michigan and Illinois, but were ruled to be unconstitutional[3] in Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n, 564 U.S. 08–1448 (2011).
This bill did not become law; it was referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and expired at the end of the 109th Congress without further action.[4]
Major Proposals [ edit ]
I. Prohibition on Selling Mature and Adults Only video games to minors [ edit ]
The centerpiece of this bill is a prohibition against any business for selling or renting a Mature, Adults-Only, or Ratings Pending game to a person who is younger than seventeen. On-site store managers would be subject to a fine of $1,000 or 100 hours of community service for the first offense; $5,000 or 500 hours of community service for each subsequent offense. This provision is not aimed at punishing retailers who act in good faith to enforce the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) system. That's why retailers would have an affirmative defense if they were shown an identification they believed to be valid or have a system in place to display and enforce the ESRB system. Similar prohibitions had become law in the last several months in California, Michigan, and Illinois, but were later overturned.
II. Annual Analysis of the Ratings System [ edit ]
Since the bill relies on the video game industry to continue rating the appropriateness of games for minors, this bill requires an annual, independent analysis of game ratings. This analysis will help ensure that the ESRB ratings system accurately reflects the content in each game and that the ratings system does not change significantly over time.
III. Authority for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to Investigate Misleading Ratings [ edit ]
Part of the genesis of this bill was the revelation that the makers of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas had included, through embedded code that was discovered and made accessible to the public, sexually explicit content inconsistent with the game's Mature rating. This bill requires the FTC to conduct an investigation to determine whether what happened with GTA: San Andreas is a pervasive problem. It also includes a Sense of Congress that the Commission shall take appropriate action if it determines that there is a pervasive problem.
IV. Authority to Register Complaints [ edit ]
This bill requires the Bureau of Consumer Protection (BCP) of the FTC to ensure that consumers can file complaints if they find content to be misleading or deceptive and requires the BCP to report on the number of such complaints to Congress.
V. Annual Retailer Audit [ edit ]
This bill authorizes the FTC to conduct an annual, random audit of retailers – sometimes referred to as a secret shopper survey – to determine how easy it is for young people to purchase Mature and Adults Only video games and report the findings to Congress.

ACTA 'May Interfere With Fundamental Freedoms' -- EU Data Protection Supervisor
from the reading-between-the-lines dept
The dramatic announcement that the EU's rapporteur on ACTA, David Martin, would be recommending that the European Parliament should reject the treaty was made at the end of a morning conference on the subject organized by Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. One of those speaking in favor of ACTA at that meeting was Helienne Lindvall, a professional songwriter and musician, who has now blogged about it: I was told to prepare a five-minute speech, so apart from speaking of the reality musicians are facing, I spent days reading the actual agreement, different points of views on it, as well as looking into the different issues it deals with, to make sure I knew what was being discussed. I'd heard from the Pirate party as well as some other action groups that it would impede freedom of speech so naturally I was concerned -- after all, musicians rely on freedom of expression, as do journalists. I was surprised to find that Acta would do nothing of the sort. That's curious, since Amnesty International does indeed see ACTA as a threat to freedom of speech -- and much else: Amnesty International believes the pact's content, process, and institutional structure impact in a number of ways on human rights -- especially the rights to due process, privacy, freedom of information, freedom of expression, and access to essential medicines. Part of the problem is that ACTA was intentionally drawn up to be as vague as possible. That can be seen in the fact that its negotiators chose to use terms that have no meaning in the context of international treaties: Amnesty International is also gravely concerned about the ACTA's vague and meaningless safeguards. Instead of using well-defined and accepted terminology, the text refers to concepts such as "fundamental principles" and even invents a concept of "fair process", which currently has no definition in international law.
"Worryingly, ACTA's text does not even contain references to safeguards like 'fundamental rights', 'fair use' or 'due process', which are universally understood and clearly defined in international law," said Widney Brown. The EU's own European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), which is "an independent supervisory authority devoted to protecting personal data and privacy and promoting good practice in the EU institutions and bodies", has just released a second opinion on ACTA (pdf) (the first dates back to 2010, and was equally critical). It concurs with Amnesty International's view of the treaty's worrying vagueness in the area of human rights: At international level, freedom of expression and privacy are recognised as fundamental rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and not as mere 'principles'. Furthermore, the notion of 'fair process' does not correspond to any generally recognised human right. The latest EDPS report is mainly concerned with ACTA's problems from the point of view of privacy, where it concludes: Many of the measures envisaged in the Agreement in the context of enforcement of IP rights in the digital environment would involve the monitoring of users' behaviour and of their electronic communications on the Internet. These measures are highly intrusive to the private sphere of individuals and, if not implemented properly, may therefore interfere with their rights and freedoms to, inter alia, privacy, data protection and the confidentiality of their communications. But the report does touch on the issue of freedom of speech when it analyzes the effects of ACTA's "Enforcement cooperation mechanisms and the monitoring of Internet by ISPs": These forms of enforcement cooperation mechanisms which entail the processing by ISPs of personal data for the purpose of IP rights enforcement and/or the monitoring of individuals' behaviour, including electronic communications, on a large scale raise serious concerns from a privacy and data protection perspective. They furthermore may lead to the disconnection of Internet access or the blocking of websites, which may interfere with fundamental freedoms such as the freedom of expression, the freedom to receive or impart information and access to culture. ACTA threatens free speech largely because of the following, apparently innocuous, sentence: Each Party shall endeavour to promote cooperative efforts within the business community to effectively address trademark and copyright or related rights infringement while preserving legitimate competition and, consistent with that Party's law, preserving fundamental principles such as freedom of expression, fair process, and privacy. As the EDPS points out, "a mere reference to these principles [freedom of expression, fair process, and privacy] is not enough." What counts is what would happen in practice. And the practice -- and the problem -- is that ACTA would encourage signatories to move to "co-operative" approaches already being deployed by some countries, with a presumption of guilt rather than innocence: These include various forms of voluntary enforcement cooperation mechanisms, such as three strikes mechanisms, blocking and filtering of peer to peer traffic, or the blocking of websites allegedly infringing copyrights. Clearly, all of those mechanisms mentioned by the EDPS "would impede freedom of speech" hugely, just as the Pirate party and others have suggested. The threat of ACTA is not just the laws that it will bring in, but the extra-judicial actions that it will encourage beyond the law.

We have seen that the central claim of New Atheism – “There is no evidence for God” – is equivalent to saying “There are no Gaps.” That is, the evidence that the atheist demands is a Gap – something that cannot be explained by natural laws. Yet the same atheist will insist that the God of the Gaps approach is not a valid way of determining whether God exists. Heads I win, tails you lose.
Of course, don't make the mistake of thinking that if only you could find a big enough Gap, the New Atheist would have to embrace that as evidence for God. After all, that's not how it would work with Richard Dawkins, the most famous atheist alive. Dawkins made this clear some time ago in an interview with atheist Peter Boghossian. You can see the demonstration for yourself in the video below. It starts at 12:30 and goes to 15:30. I'll post a transcript below the fold.
Here is the transcript (with the relevant claims):
Boghossian: What would it take for you to believe in God?
Dawkins: I used to say it would be very simple. It would be the Second Coming of Jesus or a great, big, deep, booming, bass voice saying “I am God.” But I was persuaded, mostly by Steve Zara, who is a regular contributor to my website. He more or less persuaded me that even if there was this booming voice in the Second Coming with clouds of glory, the probable explanation is that it is a hallucination or a conjuring trick by David Copperfield. He made the point that a supernatural explanation for anything is incoherent. It doesn't add up to an explanation for anything. A non-supernatural Second Coming could be aliens from outer space.
[Peter Boghossian begins to speak and is in full agreement with Dawkins, arguing, for example, that if the stars spelled out a message from God, we would first have to rule out alternative explanations, like an alien trickster culture.]
Dawkins then agrees with Boghossian.
Boghossian then asks him: So that [stars aligned into a message] couldn't be enough. So what would persuade you?
Dawkins: Well, I'm starting to think nothing would, which, in a way, goes against the grain, because I've always paid lip service to the view that a scientist should change his mind when evidence is forthcoming.
As Dawkins says, even if the Second Coming of Christ were to actually occur, Dawkins would not consider even that evidence for God. In his mind, it would be more likely that aliens would be playing a trick. Dawkins has painted himself into a corner with his extreme skepticism. In his mind, God = the supernatural and natural explanations, no matter how vague or incomplete, are always better than explanations that invoke the supernatural. Thus, it is not surprising he effectively admits nothing would persuade him to believe in God. In fact, he even makes a Freudian slip in acknowledging that all along, he has merely been paying “lip service” to the view that “a scientist should change his mind when evidence is forthcoming.” It's all been an illusion.
As atheist activist PZ Myers once wrote, ” There is no valid god hypothesis, so there can be no god evidence, so let's stop pretending the believers have a shot at persuading us.”
It is indeed time New Atheists stop pretending they can persuade with Gaps.

John McDonnell has claimed the opinion polls point to a victory for Labour in the general election - despite the Tories maintaining a double-digit lead over the opposition.
Recent surveys have seen a slight narrowing of the gap since last week's leak of the Labour draft manifesto, but even the most positive poll for Labour still puts them a massive 14 points behind Theresa May's party.
The Shadow Chancellor claimed popular polices would soon turn the tide of public opinion and sweep Mr Corbyn to power.
"What I'm saying now is we're in a general election campaign, I think we're going to win, I think the polls are showing that because our policies are so promising and on the basis of that you'll see Jeremy Corbyn in Number 10, full stop," he told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme.
Mr McDonnell refused to be drawn on whether Mr Corbyn would remain as Labour leader even if the party slump to a damaging defeat on 8 June.
"This is a daft question. When someone's about to start a race you don't go up to them and say 'are you going to win or lose? what are you going to do at the end?'. We're in the middle of a race and we're fighting it hard. Yes, we've improved in the polling this week and I think that you'll see that in the next few weeks itself and I think we're in it to win, full stop."
'DISTRACTED BY THE POLLS'
Elsewhere Emily Thornberry dismissed warnings from Labour deputy leader Tom Watson about a "Thatcher-style landslide".
“I suppose he may have been distracted by the polls," she told the Andrew Marr Show.
"But I mean the polls are not things that have been terribly reliable until now, and we have another three weeks and we are going to be out there, we are going to be putting out the message and the truth about what Labour is standing for and about what a Labour government will be and what the choice is.”
And she rounded on colleague Ben Bradshaw, who appeared to admit defeat in a letter to constituents arguing that voting for him would "not affect who governs nationally".
"It's about which politician can offer you what, what is the two different futures that Britain has and the Labour one is a much more positive one and it's much more in line with what people want. There is all to play for and I don't want Ben to be quite as defeatist as he is."
SPRINGFIELD, Mass. … American Hockey League President and Chief Executive Officer David Andrews announced today that Syracuse Crunch forward Mike Angelidis and Grand Rapids Griffins forward Jeff Hoggan will serve as playing captains for the 2016 Toyota AHL All-Star Classic, to be held January 31 and February 1 in Syracuse, N.Y.
Captains for the American Hockey League All-Star teams are selected by the league president in recognition of their outstanding leadership and service.
Mike Angelidis is in his 10th professional season in 2015-16, and fourth as captain of the Syracuse Crunch. The 30-year-old native of Woodbridge, Ont., has appeared in 605 regular-season games in his AHL career, totaling 121 goals and 132 assists for 253 points and posting at least 10 goals and 100 penalty minutes in eight straight seasons from 2007-15. Angelidis, who captained the Norfolk Admirals to a Calder Cup championship in 2012 and returned to the Finals with the Crunch in 2013, has also skated in 14 career NHL games with Tampa Bay. Angelidis will be making his AHL All-Star Classic debut.
A 14th-year pro now in his fourth season as captain of the Grand Rapids Griffins, Jeff Hoggan has skated in 653 regular-season AHL games, registering 163 goals and 159 assists for 322 points. The 37-year-old native of Hope, B.C., has won two Calder Cup championships in his career, with Houston in 2003 and with Grand Rapids in 2013, and was the 2014-15 recipient of the AHL's Fred T. Hunt Memorial Award for sportsmanship, determination and dedication to hockey. Hoggan has also appeared in 107 career games in the National Hockey League with St. Louis, Boston and Phoenix. This will be Hoggan's first AHL All-Star Classic.
Tickets for the two-day 2016 Toyota AHL All-Star Classic are on sale now. Ticket prices range from $40-60 and can be purchased either in person at the Syracuse Crunch office located in the War Memorial Arena at 800 South State Street in Syracuse, by calling (315) 473-4444 or through all Ticketmaster outlets.
The 2016 Toyota AHL All-Star Skills Competition on Jan. 31 will keep its traditional format, with All-Stars from the Eastern Conference squaring off against All-Stars from the Western Conference in seven skills events.
The 2016 Toyota AHL All-Star Challenge will take place on the evening of Feb. 1. Instead of a traditional 60-minute game, the AHL's All-Stars will be divided into four teams, one representing each of the league's divisions (Atlantic, North, Central, Pacific). The teams will then play a round-robin tournament featuring six games of nine minutes each; the first half of each game will be played at 4-on-4, and the second half at 3-on-3. The two teams with the best records at the end of the round-robin tournament will face off for the championship, a six-minute game played at 3-on-3.
The 2016 Toyota AHL All-Star Classic in Syracuse will feature the top young talent in the American Hockey League: Of the 679 players to take part in the AHL All-Star Classic since 1995, more than 93 percent have competed in the National Hockey League, including Patrice Bergeron, Ben Bishop, Troy Brouwer, Ryan Callahan, Zdeno Chara, Logan Couture, Jiri Hudler,Tyler Johnson, Chris Kunitz, Ryan Miller, Gustav Nyquist, Zach Parise, Tuukka Rask, Pekka Rinne, Bobby Ryan, Cory Schneider, Patrick Sharp, Jason Spezza, Eric Staal, P.K. Subban and Mats Zuccarello.
In operation since 1936 and celebrating its 80th-anniversary season in 2015-16, the AHL continues to serve as the top development league for all 30 National Hockey League teams. More than 88 percent of today's NHL players are American Hockey League graduates, and for the 14th year in a row, more than 6 million fans attended AHL games across North America in 2014-15.
Rightwing politician demands an investigation into U2's album giveaway, which he says ‘spammed youths with illegal content' and promoted gay sex
A Russian Duma deputy has asked Russia's attorney general to investigate Apple for distributing “gay propaganda” to minors.
Alexander Starovoitov, a member of the rightwing LDPR party, says Apple spammed youths with illegal content when it released U2's latest album, Songs of Innocence, to more than 500 million iTunes customers worldwide in September 2014.
Apple's “gift” of free copies of U2's new album to iTunes users triggered a significant backlash..
“I had this beautiful idea and we kind of got carried away with ourselves,” said frontman Bono, responding to widespread criticism of the automatic download. “Artists are prone to that kind of thing.”
The album cover in question features the band's drummer, Larry Mullen Jr, embracing his 18-year-old son, Elvis, shirtless. The image was taken by photographer Glen Luchford, and the group says it is a visual metaphor for the album and its theme of “how holding on to your own innocence is a lot harder than holding on to someone else's”.
But Starovoitov disagrees. He says the U2 album art promotes sex between men, and the newspaper Izvestia, known for its pro-Kremlin reporting, quotes Evgeny Tonky, a lawyer, who says he's ready to sue Apple for compensation for moral damages on behalf of his own son.

If Apple is convicted of distributing gay propaganda to youths, the company could be forced to cease operations in Russia for as many as 90 days, or pay a fine of up to 1 million roubles (£13,000).
The album initially launched with different cover art, the two shirtless men only appeared later, when physical copies of the album went on sale.
In November 2014, following Tim Cook's announcement that he is gay, a university in St Petersburg removed a monument to Steve Jobs and Apple. The decision was widely viewed as a direct response to Cook's coming out.

The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, based in San Francisco, California, ruled 2-1 Thursday that the pledge does not represent a government endorsement of religion, prohibited by the Constitution.
"The Pledge of Allegiance serves to unite our vast nation through the proud recitation of some of the ideals upon which our republic was founded and for which we continue to strive: one Nation under God," wrote the majority. "Millions of people daily recite these words when pledging allegiance to the United States of America."
The ruling applies only to the 11 states and territories in the West covered by the 9th Circuit, but it reinforces other rulings from other courts upholding the pledge. The same appeals court also ruled separately Thursday, upholding the use of the words "In God We Trust" on U.S. money.
The lawsuit was brought by several parents in the Sacramento, California, area who objected to the school policy.
Among them is Michael Newdow, a prominent attorney and atheist, who had brought his long-standing dispute to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2004. The justices had dismissed that earlier appeal on purely technical grounds, over questions he's lacking standing as a custodial parent to bring the lawsuit on behalf of his school-age daughter. Newdow then recruited other parents into the current case.
Newdow said he would appeal Thursday's decision but acknowledged his dim prospects going forward. "This was the appeal and this is the end of the road in terms of what you're guaranteed," he said.
Newdow said he'll ask for a rehearing and, if that fails, will appeal to the Supreme Court. "But they don't have to take it," he said, referring to the nation's high court, "and the odds are pretty good that they won't."
A woman identified only as Jan Roe was a key plaintiff, arguing she did not believe in God. She claimed the daily recitation interfered with her right to direct her child's upbringing and that it indoctrinated her child with the belief that God exists.
Children are not required to stand and repeat the pledge, but some parents said the social pressures to conform were an improper infringement of their rights. The plaintiffs now have the option of asking the Supreme Court to hear the case.
The appeals court framed the issue as a dispute over whether was a traditional patriotic exercise or a blatant religious message. The same court in 2002 agreed with Newdow and other atheist parents.
In dissent to Thursday's ruling, Judge Stephen Reinhardt said the pledge was an overtly religious message.
"Carrying out such an indoctrination in a public school classroom unconstitutionally forces many young children either to profess a religious belief antithetical to their personal views or to declare themselves through their silence or nonparticipation to be protesting nonbelievers, thereby subjecting themselves to hostility and ridicule," he wrote.
The Supreme Court previously has ruled the mere mention of God or religion by the government in a public setting does not necessarily mean a violation of the "Establishment Clause" of the Constitution, which ensures the separation of church and state.
Examples that have met high court scrutiny include Ten Commandments or Chanukah menorah displays in a public park; opening a legislative session with a prayer; granting tax breaks for religious organizations; and reimbursing transportation costs for parents whose end their children to parochial schools.
The pledge was written in 1892 by Baptist minister and educator Francis Bellamy, who made no reference to religion in his version. It was originally worded: "I pledge allegiance to my flag and the republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all." It quickly became a part of public school programs.
In 1954, Congress added the words "under God," at the urging of the Knights of Columbus and other groups. Another modification was to change "my flag" to "the flag of the United States of America."
"This decision is a victory for common sense," Supreme Knight Carl A. Anderson of the Knights of Columbus said in a news release. "Today, the court got it absolutely right: Recitation of the pledge is a patriotic exercise, not a religious prayer. ... Every reasonable person knows that, and today's decision is a breath of fresh air from a court system that has too often seemed to be almost allergic to public references to God."
The case is Newdow v. Rio Linda Union School District (05-17257).

A recent commentary speculated that the rise in the performance of California students on the College Board's Advanced Placement exams might be linked to students' choices in music.
While the opinion was not very convincing, it did rely on widely reported data from the 2016 AP results, which quoted state Superintendent Tom Torlakson. He noted that there had been a gain of 8 percent in California's AP passing rates since 2006. (2017 results will be available next month).

College Board demands proof of AP course quality
An Oakland school cut its last AP course, but teachers are teaching it anyway The AP program is a series of 38 college-level courses and exams students can take in high school, for which they may receive college credit. The nationally administered AP exam is scored on a scale of 1 to 5, with 3 being considered a passing score. Some colleges will grant students credit for an exam grade of 3, but increasingly, more-selective universities require a 4 or 5.
AP has enjoyed phenomenal growth — about 10 percent per year for the last 15 years. But that growth has come with a price — increasing failure percentages based on tests taken.
Therefore, the purported “rise” in AP scores is a bit deceptive. Since 2005, the College Board has reported scores to states as a percentage based on the number of graduating seniors (not test takers). What that has done is to encourage states to administer more and more AP classes and exams since students who fail the exams (scoring 1's and 2's) are counted no differently than students who didn't take AP exams.
So, for example, assume a school has 200 graduating seniors and that number remains relatively constant throughout the years. In hypothetical year No. 1, a hundred kids in the school take a total of 150 exams and 100 of those exams receive passing scores.
The reported passing percentage from the College Board would be 50 percent. (100 exams received passing scores and 200 seniors graduated). But the true passing percentage would be 66.7 percent. (150 exams were taken of which 100 received passing scores).
Now in hypothetical year No. 2, kids take a total of 220 exams and 110 exams receive passing scores. The College Board reports that the school had a passing percentage of 55 percent, an increase. (There were 110 exams with passing marks and 200 graduating seniors). But notice that the true passing percentage actually declined from 66.7 percent to 50 percent.
Obviously, if states want to be assured of receiving the College Board's “increasing passing percentages” phony imprimatur year-to-year, they need to get more and more kids taking more and more exams.
And that's exactly what has happened.
Unfortunately, as the program has grown, the failure rates (based on actual test takers) have climbed as well. What has been particularly disturbing has been the percentage increase in students scoring 1's, the lowest possible score. Since 1996, that figure has climbed by more than 5 percent, even though it has declined slightly in recent years. What that suggests is that too many students are being encouraged to take AP without adequate preparation.
In California, it's important to remember that the purported 8 percent rise is based on graduating seniors, not tests actually taken. Based on actual tests taken, 59 percent of exams received passing scores in 2006 and 58 percent passed in 2016.
The slight decline is fairly insignificant in California but some states — such as neighboring Nevada — routinely have less than half of exams receiving passing scores.
So while California has done an admirable job balancing AP growth, it is imperative that school districts in the state not get caught up in AP hype which insists on feeding ever greater numbers of tests to inadequately nourished students.
Patrick Mattimore taught AP psychology in the Bay Area and now lives in Thailand.
Find Quiet Room Channeling out all distractions would be your best place to start, even if that means locking yourself inside the bedroom for numerous hours in preparation. With only you, your internet access and the desire to pass these exams, you will embark on some quick memory skills designed to strengthen your ability to recall information quickly, and accurate. One excellent way to handle this is some place like Lumosity, the online brain game resource which assists with strengthening your cortex.
Locate Online Study Groups Having people lurking over your shoulder doesn't help when trying to study for midterm exams; finding people online who share the affinity of being in solitude to study would work best in your situation. Online study groups can be located through colleges, high schools and forums which offer both student types. Typing with people across the country is usually more peaceful than dealing with people constantly in your face about this or that.
Aereo officially died last week. Eight months after losing its legal battle with television networks, the failed watch-TV-on-the-Internet startup held an auction for its assets. One of the notable purchases was its trademarks, domain names, and customer list, which went to TiVo for $1 Million. What could TiVo do with these assets? Here's an intriguing possibility: TiVo could be looking into offering an Aereo-like service but one that's licensed by TV networks.
TiVo is at risk of missing out on the growth of Internet television through devices such as Smart TVs and set-top boxes like Roku, Apple TV, and Amazon Fire TV. TiVo's core product is a digital video recorder (DVR). That means that unlike Roku, Apple, and Amazon, TiVo is ultimately dependent on users recording content that they receive in other ways. An Internet retransmission deal with broadcast networks would be a neat way for TiVo to expand its offerings and compete more effectively in the Internet TV market.
Although not that many people know it, TiVo is halfway there already. It offers a product called TiVo Stream, which lets users play video that they have already recorded on their DVRs on mobile devices over the Internet (and looks not unlike a Roku box). TiVo released the product almost three years ago. TiVo Stream is analogous to SlingBox: it requires content received in your home, which it can then retransmit over the Internet. In contrast, Aereo had its own "antenna farms" in two dozen metropolitan areas that received live television and only required users to self-certify that they live in the same area in order to get the service. (The TV networks objected to the opportunities for abuse here.)
While Aereo tried unsuccessfully to argue that its service was permissible under copyright law, TiVo could build a service that does roughly the same thing by negotiating license agreements with the networks, just as cable and satellite operators have done. The main question in such agreements, of course, would be the fees that networks would get. Aereo offered various pricing options, including $8 and $12 monthly plans, but it kept all the money for itself. In contrast, DISH Network's Sling TV offers 12-21 basic cable (not broadcast) channels over the Internet for $20-30/month without a DISH Network satellite subscription, but it pays fees to companies like Time Warner and Disney that provide programming.
TiVo could certainly build such a service by itself, and it didn't purchase Aereo's antenna farms at the auction. What it did buy was access to potential customers for such a service.
Hard data about Aereo's subscribership has been hard to come by, but one data point suggests that the number was in the meager neighborhood of 100,000 (compared, for example, to over 30 million U.S. customers for Netflix ). Yet consider the cost of acquiring subscribers. Pay television has a typical subscriber acquisition marketing cost of a couple hundred dollars. That means that in theory, getting 100,000 subscribers costs a cable or satellite TV company maybe $2-3 million. If TiVo has a list of 100,000 people who had paid for Aereo's service, then that makes the $1 million a reasonable investment.
Then there's the brand name. TiVo could launch a "TV anywhere" service under the Aereo name and generate a ton of free publicity in the press -- easily worth a million dollars in PR agency fees. There is a history behind this idea of launching a legal content service under the banner of a "pirate" technology, though the results haven't been overwhelmingly positive.
The most famous one is Napster, the free file-sharing service popular in the late 1990s for MP3 music files. After a federal court shut Napster down in 2001, the Napster brand name was bought by a company called Roxio, a rather obscure vendor of digital audio and video software tools. Roxio changed its name to Napster and used the Napster brand name and cat-with-headphones logo to launch a legal paid subscription music in late 2003. It grew to a modest level -- roughly half a million paying subscribers (compared to Spotify's 15 million) -- and was eventually acquired by its close competitor Rhapsody, which keeps the Napster brand name to this day for its service in the UK.
Another example is BitTorrent, the protocol for speeding up transfers of large files (such as movies and TV shows) over the Internet by breaking them down into small parts and sending them through other users' computers to the end user. BitTorrent is an open-source protocol, not a service, but many "torrent tracker" services exist that can be used to share infringing content. The developers of BitTorrent negotiated deals with Hollywood studios and launched the paid BitTorrent Entertainment Network in 2007. The service shut down the next year.
Of course, the situation with Aereo is different: Aereo began as a paid service, not a free one like the original Napster or the various public BitTorrent trackers. If TiVo decides to pursue this direction, then the networks might be willing to make deals. The broadcast networks need to find a way to serve the audience that demands "TV anywhere" flexibility but doesn't want to be locked in to a pay TV provider, or risk irrelevance. TiVo, in turn, needs a differentiator to maintain its relevance in the era of over-the-top TV, but it wouldn't be as dependent on revenue from subscriptions to broadcast TV as Aereo was, because its main revenue source is hardware. That makes it more likely that TiVo and the networks could find the right price for a true "TV anywhere" type service, and everyone -- consumers included -- could win.
In an update due out this week, Rainbow Six Siege is getting 60hz servers. The faster refreshing servers mean games will more accurately track players movements and action – ratcheting up the tension of games even further.
Even though it was released back in 2015, Ben picked Rainbow Six Siege as the Best Game of 2017.
Ubisoft have been toying with increasing the server tick rate since early 2016, in May 2017 brand director Alexandre Remy told us how they had gotten server speeds up to 50.
That update is now coming either today or tomorrow, Ubisoft couldn't say exactly. In a Reddit post, community manager Matt Shotcha says “Following our testing of the 60hz servers towards the end of the White Noise TTS, we were able to confirm that it is now stable enough to deploy live on all platforms with 4.1. We are excited to fulfill this promise made during Operation Health, and look forward to your feedback.”
Back out in our interview with Remy, he said “faster servers […] is obviously going to have a direct impact on hit registration. It's going to be better and more reliable.”
Sounds like I'm going to have even less excuse for my headshots missing.
Last week I migrated both of my primary work computers, my desktop and my notebook, to SandForce based SSDs. My desktop now uses an OCZ Vertex 2 based on the SandForce SF-1200 with OCZ's special sauce firmware. My notebook uses Corsair's Force F100, also based on the SF-1200 but offering equal performance to the Vertex 2.
Clearly 100GB isn't enough space for everything I have, so on my desktop I have a pair of 1TB drives in RAID-1. This is where I store all of my pictures, music and some of my movies. Automatic backups happen to a separate 2TB networked drive.
I've got a separate file server that feeds the rest of my home and office with a 3TB RAID-5 array. The last part is really to feed my HTPC and hold all of my benchmarking applications, images and lab files, it's not necessary otherwise.
My desktop and notebook drives basically house an OS, applications, emails, PDFs, spreadsheets and tons of text files. In other words - highly compressible data.
This is exactly the sort of usage model SandForce was planning on when it designed its DuraWrite technology. If the majority of the data you store can somehow be represented by fewer bits you can solve a lot of the inherent problems with building a high performance SSD.
The SF-1200 and 1500 controllers do just that. The controllers and their associated firmware do whatever it takes to simply write less. In systems like my desktop or notebook, this is very simple. Writing less means the NAND lasts longer, it means that performance remains high for longer and with TRIM you can actually maintain that very high level of performance almost indefinitely.
SandForce's technology is entirely transparent to the end user. You don't get any extra capacity, all you get is better performance.
We've been looking at SandForce drives from multiple vendors for a while now. If you want the history on the technology look here, and if you want to know how SSDs work in general click here.
As I just mentioned, OCZ's Vertex 2 ended up in my desktop. That's the drive we're looking at today. I moved to SandForce SSDs not because I wanted more performance, but because I wanted to begin long term testing of the mass production firmware on these drives. If I'm going to recommend them, I'm going to use them.
Newcastle woman's numberplates cause offence
Updated
A Newcastle woman has been asked to "show cause" as to why she should keep her personalised number plates, bearing her nickname Kiki, which means genitals in a Filipino language.
Kristen Perry is so attached to her nickname Kiki she has number plates on her car bearing that name.
But the word doesn't sit well with the Roads and Traffic Authority which says it is considered offensive in the Filipino language, Tagalog.
In that language the word is used to describe part of a woman's genitals and the RTA is now demanding Ms Perry show cause to keep the plates.
Ms Perry says she was shocked.
"I was taken aback," she said.
"At first I thought it was a joke, but then I realised it was actually quite serious and that my number plates would be taken off me if I didn't respond appropriately.
"Quite frankly it's a bit of a funny thing, but at the same time quite a bit scary that we've got people that can just report a number plate that seems seems quite inoffensive to 99 per cent of us out there, but one per cent have an issue with it."
Ms Perry says her nickname is linked to her Greek heritage and she is disturbed it could be considered offensive.

After a sentencing hearing degenerated into death threats in a P.E.I. courtroom Monday, police made house calls to two families in a rural village to ensure a 45-year-old feud would not amount to more violence in Montague.
“The last thing we want is any more bloodshed,” Montague RCMP officer Kevin Baillie said Tuesday. “This type of thing, it tears the community apart.”
Alfred Guy Vuozzo, 46, was sentenced to life in prison Monday for the 2014 murders of 68-year-old Brent McGuigan and his son, Brendon McGuigan, 39. But the sentence did not appear to end the animosity. Instead, Vuozzo cursed at the McGuigans in the courtroom. And one of the McGuigans screamed that there wouldn't be another Vuozzo left alive in Montague, the Guardian newspaper reported.
After the threat, which disturbed Vuozzo's sister, the RCMP dispatched officers to speak with the man who made it.
Const. Doug Baker said he found “no immediate threat to the Vuozzo family.”
“[The man] basically said, ‘You know what, I was fired up in the heat of the moment,'” Const. Baker said.
The ill will between the two families dates back to Nov. 19, 1970 when Brent McGuigan's father struck the Vuozzo family's van. Cathy Vuozzo, 9, was killed. Her younger brother, Alfred Guy, and father survived the collision.
“I have just seen lights coming and a vehicle coming,” Vuozzo's father, Alfred Sr., told a coroner's inquest in 1971, according to a transcript obtained by the National Post.
Motorists who came upon the scene found the lifeless body of nine-year-old Cathy lying in a ditch. The driver of the half-ton truck, Herbert McGuigan, was unconscious on the floor of his cab with a few beer caps around him.
“There was a strong odour of alcohol and his eyes were watery and he gave me the impression that he knew little of what happened,” a police constable testified at the inquest.
Herbert McGuigan was convicted of causing Cathy's death “by driving a motor vehicle while his ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.” He was sentenced to nine months in jail and banned from driving for a year. He has since died.
Before he was sentenced on Monday, Vuozzo told the court that he had been tormented by his sister's death and the meager jail sentence meted out as punishment.
“That's all her life was worth,” said Vuozzo. “She only had nine years in this world. And nobody cared.
“It's haunted me all my life.”
‘She hit me and that was it. It's over with now'
There are few other records showing any animosity between the two families — save for an incident at a local Legion in the 1990s, when Cathy's mother allegedly hit one of McGuigan's sons.
“She hit me and that was it,” Ivan McGuigan told the Post Tuesday. “It's over with now.”
But four decades after the crash, on Aug. 20, 2014, Alfred Vuozzo parked his car on the shoulder near the McGuigan home with a handgun in his pocket. He saw two men sitting in the window, according to an agreed statement of facts submitted to the court.
He shot Brendon first with the .22 calibre pistol, then Brent.
“The younger male looked like he was trying to get up, so he shot him again, this time in the face,” according to a summary of Vuozzo's statement to police the next day.
As the men lay on the floor, Vuozzo said something to the effect of “I did this for what your father did to my baby sister,” Vuozzo recounted to police.
Brent's wife, Marie McGuigan, was in another room. She heard someone say “my sister,” and, after investigating, found her husband and son on the floor.
Vuozzo saw her and later told police he could have “smoked her, but I didn't.”
Vuozzo drove away from the scene, eluding a police manhunt. He buried the gun, ammunition and a pair of black gloves near a pond where he used to go hunting. Around midnight, he appeared at his brother's house.
“I did it, I got them,” he told Jeremy Vuozzo.
Jeremy knew what he was talking about. Alfred, who suffered from mental health issues, had spoken of exacting revenge for the 1970 crash.
Shortly after Alfred left the house, Jeremy called the police.

Peruvian officials say Joran van der Sloot has confessed to the slaying of Stephany Flores Ramirez. What will this development mean for the Natalee Holloway case? Watch "Nancy Grace," at 8 p.m. ET Tuesday on HLN.
Lima, Peru (CNN) -- The Peruvian woman who died in Joran van der Sloot's hotel room was killed after she discovered information on his laptop linking him to the disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway, a source with direct knowledge of the investigation told CNN.
Van der Sloot, the longtime suspect in the Holloway case, confessed Monday night to the killing of Stephany Flores Ramirez, 21, whose body was found in a hotel room last week, Peruvian authorities said.
He could be formally charged as early as Wednesday, the authorities said.
Van der Sloot was interrogated for seven hours Monday, the source with direct knowledge of the investigation told CNN.
The Dutch citizen told investigators that he left the hotel room to buy bread and coffee at a gas station next to the hotel, the source said.
Upon his return, he found Flores going through his laptop, where she found something linking him to the disappearance of Holloway, the source said.
At that point, Flores wanted to leave, and the pair started arguing, according to the source.
Flores slapped van der Sloot, and he hit her back, and then grabbed her neck, the source said.
Van der Sloot told investigators he was intoxicated on marijuana when all this happened, the source said.
Although Flores' body was found half-dressed, there was no evidence that she had sexual intercourse that night, the source said.
Van der Sloot had access to a public defender, but it was unclear whether he had used his services. Attempts by CNN to reach the public defenders' office were unsuccessful.
Van der Sloot, 22, was arrested twice in connection with Holloway's disappearance in Aruba but was released for lack of evidence. He has denied any involvement and has not been charged.
He was originally slated to show authorities Tuesday a re-enactment of the crime at the Hotel Tac, where he was staying. Because of security reasons, however, the re-enactment has been delayed, authorities said Tuesday.
Peru National Police Col. Abel Gamarra said the re-enactment could happen as early as Wednesday.
Flores' body was found in the room registered to van der Sloot. Video from hotel security cameras shows van der Sloot and Flores entering his room at 5:33 a.m. on May 30. He emerged alone and left the hotel more than three hours later, the video shows.
He was arrested in Chile on Thursday and returned to Peru on Friday.
At van der Sloot's first court appearance, the judge may set a hearing date and order additional investigations.
The Peruvian justice system often issues a lighter sentence in cases in which the suspect confesses.
Van der Sloot could get up to 35 years in prison. There is no death penalty or life sentence in Peru.
A Peruvian police report leaked Monday said Flores' body was found on van der Sloot's hotel room floor, half-dressed. The report also provides new details about the hours before the body was found.
According to the document, the Hotel Tac received a call from someone looking for van der Sloot about 11 p.m. June 1. The receptionist forwarded the call, but no one answered. The hotel worker assumed that van der Sloot was asleep because the room key was with him and not at the front desk.
About an hour later, according to the police report, the receptionist noticed that van der Sloot owed money for two nights and went up to his room, where her knocks went unanswered. The television was blaring, so the hotel employee figured he was resting, the report says.
Afterward, the hotel supervisor told the employee to go back to van der Sloot's room and enter using a spare key. When the employee went in, she found Flores' body on the floor, dressed in a black T-shirt and red panties, half-covered with a piece of white clothing, the police report said.
Flores had bled from her nose, the report said.
The hotel employee became frightened and went to alert her supervisor and the police, turning off the television and lights on her way out of the room, the report said.
The developments in the van der Sloot case came as the Natalee Holloway Resource Center opened Tuesday in Washington. The nonprofit center is located at the National Museum of Crime and Punishment. Natalee's mother, Beth Holloway, attended the opening.
She urged supporters to keep the Flores family "in our hearts and in our prayers."
The center says it will provide families of missing persons help with managing their crises and give students advice on traveling safely.

New category for Yahtzee so you can't really compare it to last year's awards, but yeah, Halo 5: Turdians was named the blandest of the bland for 2015. It shares the title with games like Assassin's Creed Syndicate, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and others I can't remember and can't be bothered to watch the video again to see because, well, bland.Interestingly enough, my two favorite games this year, Elite: Dangerous and Undertale, made number 2 and 1 respectively on the "Best of" spot.And I hear you, raging fanboys angered by this topic's very existence ruining your 343i-teet-sucking-session, Yahtzee is a PC gamer above all and Halo is just the sort of big franchise title that's so very easy to bash from a PC gamer's perspective-- but as someone who's not a PC gamer and has played every single Halo and has mostly enjoyed every single Halo (up until now), I have to agree. The game does very little to add something new and refreshing to the franchise, just rehashed gimmicks from other FPS titles. Not to mention the content that made Halo, well, Halo, and not Space Call of Duty Advanced Armored Sociopathic Space Marine Warfare, is oddly missing from the game. More than half the gametypes that worked very well with Halo's sandbox have gone missing without so much as a "Have you seen this gamemode?" label on the side of a milk carton. Plus you can throw any idea of this Halo being another Halo with couch co-op or LAN parties into the crapper, because it has neither. Oh what's that? Your internet down or Lizard nerds being Lizard nerds again? I'll just play Forge until--- ohhh wait nevermind it's online-only.My friend started sounding like a parent worried about their depressed teenage child, because he keeps telling me "It gets better." I'm having a hard time believing that though. Every time I look at 343i's recent business practices I don't get a sense of "We hear you," but instead "I can't hear you over the millions you already gave to us, suckers". We get free monthly updates which basically means "This game was not finished at launch so we're adding stuff over time and calling it free," but even those updates feel hollow. People have made list after list and "demand" after "demand" on things the whole community would like to see come to this game in the future and we've gotten very few of it. Instead we get a fix or two here and there for things like the atrocious aiming or file sharing, but the bulk of these updates seems like things they've planned for a while and don't actually fix any of the problems with the game. Several of the 'new' maps were shown pre-release either as concept art or promotional material (I'm looking at you Battle of Noctus), and I'm sure more "remix" maps are to come which have nothing to do with the lack of gametypes or social aspects that the game sorely...well...lacks. More randomly-"earned" cosmetics and weapons instead of actual requirements and ways to get them (I'm looking at you Achilles Armor; a step in the right direction but we need a lot more done like this and not just for the new stuff going forward).Voice your blind defenses with the age-old "That's just your opinion" line or agree with a smash of that like button. And discuss if you agree with Yahtzee or not and why, and please try to use common sense with your responses.
That's it; it's over for another year. As we dive into 2012, it's down with the decorations and turkey sandwiches in the bin as we wave good bye to Christmas for another year. Aww.
Well, almost. Before we do that, there are just a few festive bits that still need wrapping up.

Caribou in Canada's North are showing increasing levels of mercury, a contaminant that has drifted into the Arctic from other parts of the world, researchers have found.
Mercury is one of two contaminants found in northern environments that are of great concern to scientists, said Mary Gamberg, project co-ordinator with federal Northern Contaminants Program in the Yukon.
Gamberg said mercury "seems to be increasing in some [wildlife] populations all across the Arctic," she told CBC News in an interview Monday.
"In marine mammals, in some populations, it's increasing. And in caribou, in some populations — and particularly in female caribou — it seems to be increasing, which is really interesting," she added.
The contaminants program also monitors the amounts of cadmium in the North, but Gamberg said cadmium occurring in wildlife is due to natural sources and levels in animals are currently stable.
Mercury, however, is a major concern not just in the Arctic ecosystem, but also around the world, Gamberg said.
"The mercury is emitted down south, it comes up into the North, it falls out of the air because it's very cold here," she said.
"So we get a lot of mercury that isn't originated in the Arctic, but we get it. So it's in the environment and it's in the wildlife."
This year marks the 15th year that the Northern Contaminants Program has been annually testing the livers, kidneys and other body parts of caribou, moose and other northern animals.
Gamberg said the program has recently expanded to accept animal samples from the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. Researchers even received samples from Greenland last year, she added.
The contaminants program was set up in 1991, in response to northerners' concerns about eating traditional game animals that have been exposed to toxic substances drifting into the Arctic from industrialized regions elsewhere.
Health Canada recommends that people not eat more than 25 caribou kidneys a year from the Porcupine caribou herd, Gamberg said.
As for current research, Gamberg said scientists are studying why mercury levels in caribou are rising, particularly in female caribou.
Researchers will look at what caribou eat, including lichen, cotton grass and willows, to see where the elevated amounts of mercury are coming from.
This year's research will focus on the Porcupine caribou herd, Gamberg said. Researchers hope to study the Bathurst herd in the Northwest Territories next year.
Other studies are ongoing into mercury levels in other northern animals, she added.

“Stop LGBT-phobia”: hundreds take to the streets in Salvador, Brazil
https://www.instagram.com/p/BICw_5EArBD/?tagged=chegadelgbtfobia
Hundreds of persons took to the streets of the Rio Vermelho district in Salvador to call for an end to hate crimes against “gay, lesbian, trans, bisexual, cis women and other vulnerable individuals” in the city.
The march, backed by more than 50 associations, was organised after the passing of Leonardo Moura, a 30-year-old gay man who was beaten to death after leaving a party held in a LGBT-friendly club in the city.
According to one of the organisers, a group of mothers of LGBT persons came up with the idea of the protest: “Many people are beginning to think of friends, children, relatives who suffer and may suffer because of homophobia,” he was quoted as saying. “They are here because there is a new case every day, each time closer to home.”
Grupo Gay da Bahia, one of the associations involved in the protest, said at least 20 persons have died in the state since the beginning of 2016 in what may have been hate crimes on the grounds of homophobia and transphobia.

LGBT+ e-zine faces opposition in Jordan after first publication in Arabic
Bravo @mykali_mag for publishing in Arabic & English! Here's to more #LGBTQ voices in our region. https://t.co/7jNc1s668D — Mona Eltahawy (@monaeltahawy) July 20, 2016
A LGBT+ inclusive webzine in Jordan received a handful of attacks after publishing an issue in Arabic for the first time.
My.Kali, which “strives to address homophobia and transphobia and empower the youth to defy mainstream gender binaries in the Arab world,” debuted in 2007, but was only published in English until now. “The change”, its founder said in an interview with Raseef 22, “came after so many gay people, who can only read Arabic, wanted us to do an Arabic edition. We wanted to start spreading awareness on these issues.”
The decision was met with praise, but also with criticism and attacks on social media. News outlets, GayStarNews reports, questioned why the magazine is ‘provoking the public', while others accused it of holding a ‘foreign agenda.' The Media Commission of Jordan, then, released a statement to state My.Kali is not registered and, if proven to be printed, would face a lawsuit.
In a Facebook post, My.Kali editors denied they had received death threats, as reported in international media. A statement was also released to deny "plans to issue hardcopies or become a formal registered entity in Jordan,” and to reiterate that “the Jordanian LGBTQ community (…) is not a foreign import or construct, nor does it have an agenda to debase Jordanian traditions.”

International AIDS Conference kicks off in Durban, South Africa
Stamp out stigma and discrimination: fight AIDS and HIV, not people living with them #AIDS2016 pic.twitter.com/Xh1GG9lANH — ILGA (@ILGAWORLD) July 21, 2016
More than 18,000 global leaders, scientists, advocates, and health workers have gathered in Durban for the 21st International AIDS Conference, focusing on the work still to be done if the world is to achieve the global goal of ending AIDS by 2030.
Held under the theme Access Equity Rights Now, the conference also addressed the need to overcome ongoing barriers impeding more effective HIV/AIDS responses, including discriminatory laws and policies that affect key populations. “We will not end AIDS without addressing the needs of the most vulnerable individuals and communities,” said Chris Beyrer, AIDS 2016 International Chair and President of the International AIDS Society. “Protecting human rights is not just a moral issue, it is a scientific issue.”
Meanwhile, over 8,000 activists from across the globe marched to demand the spotlight be “on the 20-million people‚ mostly poor‚ marginalised and criminalised‚ stuck away in all corners of the world‚ who are dying in undignified surroundings‚ often far away from any semblance of a functioning health system and even further away from the antiretroviral treatment that saves lives.”

Romania: court approves citizen's initiative aimed at amending constitutional definition of family
The Romanian Constitutional Court gave green light to a referendum aimed at changing the definition of family in the constitution.
The proposal suggests altering Article 48.1 by removing the word “spouses” and replacing it with a specific reference to one man and one woman: an amendment that, as ILGA-Europe points out, would “have profound implications for same-sex couples and their children living in Romania.”
"We regret that the prejudices of society have led the Court to deny international human rights standards in matters of family and respect for human dignity," ACCEPT, an ILGA member organisation, wrote in a press statement. "We call on politicians to act responsibly towards the LBGT community."
The constitutional amendment will now be discussed by Parliament: before a referendum is held, both chambers will have to approve the proposal by a three-quarters majority.

United States: 2.2 million LGBT adults experienced food insecurity in the past year, research finds
Adult members of the LGBT community often experience food insecurity and participate in the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program at higher rates than non-LGBT adults, a new research by the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law has found.
According to the study, more than 1 in 4 LGBT adults in the United States – approximately 2.2 million people – experienced a time in the last year when they did not have enough money for the food that they or their families needed, compared to less than 1 in 5 of non-LGBT adults.
Some groups among the broader LGBT community are more exposed to food insecurity than others: certain racial and ethnic minorities, women, unmarried individuals, and those raising children are particularly likely to report not having enough money for food.
“Contrary to the stereotype that LGBT people are affluent, many do not have the resources to access the food that they and their families need,” said Taylor Brown, one of the authors of the study. “policymakers and anti-hunger organizations need to include LGBT people when considering issues of poverty, homelessness, and hunger.”

Australia: support for marriage equality plebiscite not so ‘overwhelming', poll shows
The plebiscite? Well it's not so popular now... https://t.co/UyQ2pqv8EY #MarriageEquality — AU Marriage Equality (@AMEquality) July 20, 2016
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull may have claimed that “there is overwhelming support in the community for the plebiscite” on marriage equality in Australia, but results of a recent survey say otherwise. A poll commissioned by PFLAG, in fact, found that only 48% of the 1,000 respondents surveyed support the plebiscite, while 30% oppose it and 20% are undecided.
Support fell to 33% when responders were told the result of a plebiscite would not be binding, and came in at 25% when people were told the public consultation is expected to cost $160m.
“Support for a plebiscite has fallen dramatically since it was first mooted in August last year and about 70% of the public backed the idea," Australian Marriage Equality national director, Rodney Croome, said. “I attribute this to the public being made aware of how costly, unnecessary and damaging it will be."
Meanwhile, Turnbull has said he would bring legislation to enable a plebiscite as soon as practicable: the plebiscite, though, may not be held until early 2017, later than what was previously expected.

On August 11, 1964, the City of Homewood voted to be annexed into the City of Birmingham. The vote count was 2,423 to 2,417. The election was overturned, though, in the Alabama Supreme Court decision City of Birmingham v. Bouldin, 1966, because the election was not properly advertised, among other things.
This particular election was also a mayoral general election and it followed a string of similar elections that were also organized improperly in Vestavia and Mountain Brook.
That 1964 election is significant, though, to me, because the people of Homewood, at one of the most treacherous times in Birmingham's history, voted in favor of being annexed into the City of Birmingham. Obviously six votes isn't a super majority, but, it shows that at one time there was a major step toward progress. Many of the problems that this 1964 election faced have since been fixed, which leads me to question whether another vote could be organized.
It would be interesting if multiple cities simultaneously voted of whether or not to be annexed into Birmingham. It would probably need to be concurrent with a major election so as to insure as many people participating as possible. Say, a certain presidential election that's coming up. Leeds, Vestavia, Homewood, Hoover, Trussville, Fairfield, Mountain Brook, Irondale, Bessemer, Helena, Moody, Pleasant Grove, and a dozen other cities could all participate. Two years is surely enough to inform the citizens of the issues, challenges, and benefits of consolidating the government the area's cities.
Some of these issues would be the multiple school districts that would need to be consolidated. Bond swaps and some heavy financial accounting work would have to happen. Property tax and sales tax rates would change, as well as lodging tax and business license fees. The number of people the different cities employ could be reduced, causing an increase in unemployment, but, would save tax payers money and create more efficient local government. The Birmingham City Council would have to reorganized to be more representative of any new portions of the city, and elections for new city and school board officials would need to happen. A lot of local politicians would lose their positions and voices. However, the new city would be able to represent a greater portion of the metropolitan area, giving more power to the citizens of this new Birmingham.
If all of the previously listed cities merged with Birmingham, the new city would have a population of right at 500,000 people; that would make Birmingham the 35th largest city in the United States. The crime rate would drop, schools would be improved, and Birmingham could compete on a national level so as to bring more civic and commercial options to its citizens. Better buses, better schools, better shopping, better jobs, and better government. Police and fire departments would be better staffed and positioned, making for a safer city. A couple years of headaches would lead to a tremendously improved future that we could all enjoy and benefit from.

A standoff between East Vancouver's most infamous crow and Canada's mail delivery service seems to have come to an end.
Canada Post has restored home delivery to about a dozen residents living in a neighbourhood near the PNE, where service had been halted because Canuck the Crow had attacked a mail carrier.
Coverage of Canuck the Crow on Globalnews.ca:
“I'm just happy to have mail delivery back,” said local resident Shawn Bergmann, who describes himself as Canuck's friend.
Bergmann said Canuck had bitten the letter carrier during nesting season about two months ago, an incident that left the mailman bleeding.

In the wake of the bite, Canada Post sent Bergmann a letter saying it was “safeguarding employees” by not delivering to areas where the crow had been known to attack, until Canuck was no longer a threat.
Bergmann said the disruption of mail service caused some stress between neighbours, and even led to some “subtle and not-so-subtle threats towards Canuck.”
Bergmann said he previously reached out to Canada Post to offer solutions, including arming the letter carrier with a small umbrella that could be used as a shield, but that he'd initially received a “cold, corporate response.”
He added he'd not heard anything further from Canada Post, and so he was shocked to see letters turn up in his mailbox on Tuesday morning.
“It was actually my landlord who let me know the mail had been delivered,” he said. “[It was] very, very surprising.”
“I found out my neighbours got their mail as well. It was also without an interaction with Canuck which was another nice thing to hear.”
With the impasse resolved, Bergmann said he's grateful the ruffled feathers have been smoothed over.
“Thank you Canada Post,” he said.

The feisty crow has become something of an East Vancouver celebrity for his fearlessness around humans and interest in food and shiny objects.
He has been the subject of multiple news stories, and now has his own Facebook and Twitter pages.
In January of last year, Canuck was seen riding the SkyTrain.
A few months later, he turned up a crime scene where he picked at items and sat on top of a police truck until an officer waved him away.
Most recently, Canuck caused a stir at an East Vancouver McDonald's, where he was spotted helping himself to diners' meals.
Police are calling a January burglary of a northwest suburban home "disturbing"--not just because of the stolen goods, but because the young burglars killed goldfish to avoid leaving "any witnesses."
According to TribLocal, a Nintendo game system, CD player, 30 video games, 30 DVDs, a BB gun, jewelry and fire safe containing personal papers and photographs were stolen from an Arlington Heights home sometime between Jan. 22 and Jan. 24.
When the homeowners returned, not only did they find their belongings stolen, but found their goldfish had been poisoned. Someone had poured hot sauce, mustard, ketchup and spices into their fish tank, and all three fish were dead.
Three teenagers were arrested for the burglary, according to the Daily Herald, and a 16-year-old involved with the incident reportedly told officers he "didn't want to leave any witnesses," so he killed the fish.
The boys, ages 15, 16 and 17, allegedly targeted the home because it had been evacuated following a Jan. 19 fire.
Using Airplay to Control The Sound on Your Patio Speakers
If you have an iPhone, iPad, or Mac, and you use iTunes, it's as easy as 1-2-3.
Transmitting sound to your patio speakers Transmitting sound to your patio speakers
First, you need a pair of patio speakers. Ideally you'll mount them up under eaves or an overhang that allows them to be somewhat protected from the elements. Speakers that mount flush to the wall can be subject to vibration, so try to mount them on brackets that give them a little breathing space.
Bonus: not only will that reduce vibration, it will also help the overall sound of the speakers.
Apple Airport Express
Next, you need a way of transmitting sound to the speakers. If you've got speakers already wired to a receiver, pick up an Apple Airport Express Wi-Fi Base Station (around $99 at the Apple Store) and connect it to your internet connection wirelessly or by using an ethernet cable. Follow the prompts to get it set up, and then attach it to your receiver via an Audio cable.
Tip: If you're having trouble setting it up plug-and-play style, download Airport Utility to your computer and follow the prompts. It'll get you back on track in no time!
Set Airplay up on your network so that it is able to see the sound system you're using to transmit to the patio. You'll find it helpful to name the network according to location - eg Living Room, Patio, Sarah's Bedroom - so that you can easily select the right system when you're transmitting.
Once you have Airport up and running, download the "Remote" app from Apple and install it on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. This free application will turn your device into a wireless remote for your iTunes library.
Use Airplay for Outdoor Speakers
Launch iTunes and select the network name you gave your patio speakers. On the iPad, you first select the double-screen icon to indicate which network you want to join, and then you click on the Volume icon to control where the speakers are playing - on the system that iTunes is hardwired to, or on the system that you have networked in with your Airport Express.
That's it! you're up and running, with all your music and playlists at your fingertips. No need to wait for someone to go in and flip the record - you've got your entire digital library at your fingertips, and you can create awesome soundtracks for your patio speakers that will play for the length of your party.
How do you power your remote speaker systems? Tell us in the comments below!
I didn't attach photos to this review because everyone knows what a Fire Stick and remote look like by now and frankly....the Set-Up and use is super-simple. Lots of people here have covered the "tech specs" in detail, so I'll only overview that and focus on my actual experience.
The stick is very easy to use...plug it into your television's HDMI port, flip your actual TV to "HDMI 2" (or whatever mode you use for other devices) and then put batteries in the remote, click a few buttons...and the menu and stick load up. The first thing you want to do is browse the apps and download the ones you'll primarily be using to view shows. Definitely start out with Hulu, Netflix, and HBO Now. If you have satellite radio stations you love on your phone/devices....probably download Pandora or other 3rd party radio app for when you don't feel like browsing Amazon's Music Library and just want it to auto-play.
Please note, that I'm a Prime member, so my review IS based on having a lot more built-in features than if I wasn't a Prime member (more show/movie options available in my membership). I do have regular Cable and pay over $200 per month, but I purchased the Fire Stick on Prime Day for $24.99 because I figured just having access to Amazon's own shows and music library more than made up for the cost of the stick (and it does if you include nothing else).
For Prime members, there are quite a few HBO shows on the regular "For Prime" menu available. A majority of them are free to Prime members with the exception of 2 or 3 shows like "Justified". And NO ...."Game of Thrones" is not a regular Amazon Prime option if you were holding out hope. However, I bookmarked probably 25 free HBO shows and Amazon Shows right away and was impressed the many options available to Prime members in the shows. The movie library is pretty large, but is a lot like Netflix and features mostly really old classics like "Top Gun" and "Platoon" and "Hunt for Red October". There are a few newer movies here and there, but don't expect to get any new releases whether you're a Prime member or not. I'm happy with the options available, though.
The sound and video quality is excellent and there are no problems with freezing or lagging that I've noted. The remote and menu are easy to navigate and fairly easy to bookmark once you get the hang of the layout. I have no gripes with the number of shows Amazon offers to Prime members for the $24.99 I paid for the stick. I figure that price plus the yearly fee of $99 for the Prime Membership make each thing (the cost of membership as well as the cost of stick) more worthwhile when in conjunction even if I never use either again after the year is up.
Most of the Premium apps are the same price as you would pay through your Cable Provider and offer no more than a 7-Day Trial. So if there's something you want to see on Showtime, Starz, etc....do it fast and in 7 days otherwise, you'll be stuck with a subscription added onto your Cable Bill. I don't *think* you can use them unless you're willing to provide your Cable Provider info...so I recommend not bothering to download those.
However, DEFINITELY think about using the HBO NOW application because you do NOT need to have regular Cable, you don't have to provide your Cable Provider info, and if you choose to subscribe, you can cancel at anytime and the subscription is attached to your Prime Account Payment info rather than attached to your Cable Bill. It's a 30 Day free trial and means you can binge watch all of the shows that you'd have to pay for on the "Prime Members" menu on Amazon for free....or you can pay $14.99 per month with no contract if you plan to watch a lot of the HBO shows that Amazon offers....but charges $24.99 PER SEASON for. That's why I wrote a whole section about the HBO NOW app. You can watch HBO's FULL lineup as much as you want for $14.99 per month....so DON'T fall for paying $24.99 per season of individual and limited HBO shows on the regular Amazon menu.
My biggest gripe is that Amazon doesn't tell you this (and I understand that they're trying to make money), but it annoys me that when you come across an HBO shows that isn't included in your Prime Membership and you select the "more ways to watch" button, it doesn't tell you that you can view anything you want on HBO NOW for $14.99 (nor the free 30 day trial), it just tells you that you can rent/buy each season from Amazon for the much higher price. And as a Prime Member that already pays $100 per year, I think it's a bit sleazy.
What royally pissed me off was that nearly all of the HBO shows that are NOT free to Prime Members are clearly marked as you're scrolling through them. They are mostly either totally free to Prime members....or totally NOT free and clearly marked. But Amazon ADVERTISES the popular HBO show, "VEEP" as free to watch for Prime members....and then it wasn't. I wouldn't have minded if it was clearly marked a "paid" show....but what is actually "free to Prime members" is ONLY the first 3 Seasons. Season 4 and 5 suddenly ask you for $24.99 to keep watching! I was really unhappy about that because it's reasonable to expect people to read to see whether or not the titles are "free for Prime members", but to except people to scroll through 30 episodes and 3 Seasons just to "make sure" it's still free is ridiculous and clearly a sleazy ploy that sucks people into watching the first 3 Seasons of Veep (so you're already into it) and then WHAM! you can't watch any more unless you want to pay the insane $24.99 two times for the other 2 Seasons. So that is when I went ahead and downloaded HBO NOW for the free month so that I could watch the rest of VEEP at no charge and whatever other shows I can't get on Amazon.
Since that happened, now I have to go through every season, every episode, one-by-one before I get into a series because I don't want a nasty surprise like that again and I'd rather not watch or get into those shows to begin with. And it annoys me that I have to do that on shows that are listed as "free for Prime" for the first few Seasons. Maybe VEEP is the only show they did that with, but I haven't had a chance to get through checking each episode of every show to find out yet. But beware because that's a show they use as an advertisement to Prime Members that you can watch "free"....but not really.
So I recommend getting the 30 days free HBO and watching whatever shows are listed as "paid" on Amazon's menu first during that 30 day free trial....and saving the truly free HBO shows on Amazon's menu for after you decide to cancel the HBO membership (or decide to keep it since $14.99 isn't bad for the network most shows air on that you'd want to see, but don't get on Amazon's menu).
I wanted to highlight that because I saw other reviews with some confusion regarding the free/paid shows. I didn't come across any that said "free" but then took you to a paid screen/advertisement....but I definitely experienced watching 3 full Seasons of VEEP and then getting a surprise at Season 4 when it told me to pay $24.99 for it. So there is definitely still some shady stuff that you need to watch for and try to utilize so that it works best for you and hopefully this helps people avoid the VEEP-trap.
I don't know how many other shows have this trap, but I'll update this to list them once I can get through the tedious and totally unnecessary task of going through every episode of every show to find out how "free" they really are. Shame on Amazon for this. It's really a crappy way to treat members already paying $100 per year.
That being said, I still give these 4 stars because there IS a large selection of shows and music for Prime Members without considering the HBO shows. However, if you aren't a Prime Member....I can't imagine what you'd have left to watch. I also have a Netflix subscription prior to this along with the Prime Membership and *for now* the HBO NOW Trial....but honestly, if you don't have Prime there would be pretty much nothing to watch unless you managed to find a few freebies on 3rd Party apps. Maybe I just don't know about them, but I didn't see anything listed as "free to everyone" without having previous memberships or Prime. Maybe Hulu still has some free shows??
Anyway, overall this is still a good deal for Prime Members and a good way to make the most out of your membership cost if you're like me and don't have any interest in watching shows/movies on your tablet and mostly ignore that feature if you can't play it on your TV. I don't even own a Kindle....I have a Samsung S2 Tablet and got the Prime membership largely for the 2 day Prime Shipping and mostly nothing else. I'm glad that buying the stick made my membership more worthwhile to me.
I'll update this if I find more shady, hidden fees and/or added features that I didn't know about as I use the stick more and plod through the lists of shows you can actually watch.
The new chief minister said several attempts were made to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi but appointments were denied.
New Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Kalikho Pul today proved his majority on the floor of the Assembly with the support of 40 legislators.The 40 MLAs who lent support to Mr Pul comprised 27 of Congress, 11 of BJP and two independents. The nine Congress MLAs of the camp of former chief minister Nabam Tuki shifted their allegiance to Mr Pul yesterday and voted for him. The Speaker did not vote.The 17 Congress MLAs loyal to Mr Tuki were absent following CLP chief whip (Tuki group) Rajesh Tacho's stern direction to the party MLAs yesterday to abstain from voting in support of Mr Pul.However, chief whip of Congress Legislative Party Pema Khandu had issued another whip directing the party MLAs to vote in favour of the incumbent chief minister.Mr Pul, sworn in on February 19 when Central rule was withdrawn from the state, had moved the motion of confidence in the House immediately after election of Wangki Lowang as the new Speaker to prove his strength.Participating in the motion, Mr Pul said several attempts were made to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi but appointments were denied."We have requested the party high command for change in leadership but did nothing against the Congress party... Our government will be a Congress government with outside support from BJP and two Independents," he added.Ridiculing Mr Tuki's claim that he still has the numbers, Mr Pul said "Whoever has the majority can form the government. In a House of 58 members, 30 MLAs are required to form the government and we have support of 41. Moreover, to become the CLP leader, support of only 23 members is required and I have 28 with me," he said.Criticising Mr Tuki, the new chief minister alleged that there was no consensus during the former's regime as he ran an "autocratic government" and the state's financial position was in bad shape."The state recorded an over draft of Rs 1,253.14 crore with RBI during the last three years for which the state government was unable to provide salaries to the employees in time," he said.The Chief Minister said he has full faith in the judiciary and whatever was done to form the government was in accordance with the constitutional provisions."Government formation and floor test have no links with the ongoing court cases," Mr Pul said and assured to bring out a white paper on state's financial health soon besides continuing the corrective measures adopted by Governor J P Rajkhowa during the central rule in the state.
Just how good was Odell Beckham Jr. for the Giants this season? Only one NFL offensive rookie has ever been better.
New York lost its season finale to Philadelphia, 34-26 on Sunday, but just like he's been the entire second half of the season, the wide receiver was a big winner. He tied his short-career high with 12 receptions and set his new best for yardage, 185 — hard to do give he had 130-plus yards in five other games.

Add in the touchdown he also scored against the Eagles, and these are the first-rounder from LSU's final totals: 91 catches, 1,305 yards and 12 touchdowns — in just 12 games.
It's been 16 years since another wide receiver had that exact kind of immediate impact on the league. In 1998, Randy Moss wowed with 1,313 yards and 17 touchdowns on just 69 catches. Anquan Boldin did have more catches than both for the Cardinals in 2003 (103), but isn't in the conversation in contrast to the others' bigger all-around rookie splashes.
Projected for a full season, Beckham would have been on pace for this: 121 receptions, 1,740 yards and 16 scores. Given how much he kept elevating his game with dazzling consistency, those are low-end estimates.
Beckham was incredible in making up ground on three other talented fellow first-rounders after he was hamstrung and couldn't suit up for the first four months,. Carolina's Kelvin Benjamin, Buffalo's Sammy Watkins and Tampa Bay's Mike Evans all were building strong cases for 2014 offensive rookie of the year early. That was until Beckham's big-market acrobatics left them and everyone else in the dust.

Yes, Moss did his work on a 15-1 Vikings team that went all the way to the NFC championship game. But then again, that was on a then record-setting scoring offense with a lot of playmakers. Beckham was the center of attention on a struggling, banged-up 6-10 team, carrying the offense game after game.
It's close, but Beckham, matching young Moss in speedy game-breaking and savvy route-running, gets the edge.
So Beckham just posted the top season for a rookie wide receiver. He shouldn't mind, however, settling for No. 2 among offensive rookies all-time.
That's because no rookie will ever come close to what Bears Hall of Fame running back Gale Sayers did in 1965.
Sayers had 1,374 yards from scrimmage. But it also came with 14 rushing touchdowns. And six receiving touchdowns. And one kickoff return touchdown. And a punt return touchdown. Don't forget that passing touchdown, either. Or those 898 return yards.
Heck, Beckham shouldn't fret. It was almost 40 years before we were able to gush about a rookie playmaker this much. He's behind a guy in Canton and ahead of a guy who will be in Canton. Not bad.
The good news for us: Beckham has a lot more ho-hum highlight-reel catches yet to come.
This year's 25th issue of Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine announced on Monday that OLDCODEX will perform a theme song for the first Kuroko's Basketball compilation film. The film, titled Winter Cup Sōshū-hen ~Kage to Hikari~ (Winter Cup Compilation ~Shadow and Light~), will open in Japan on September 3.
The second compilation film is titled Winter Cup Sōshū-hen ~Namida no Saki e~ (Winter Cup Compilation ~Beyond the Tears~), and it will open in Japan on October 8. The third film is titled Winter Cup Sōshū-hen ~Tobira no Mukō~ (Winter Cup Compilation ~Crossing the Door~), and it will open in Japan on December 3.
Aside from the compilation films, an anime film adaptation of the Kuroko no Basuke Extra Game manga is also scheduled for 2017.
Tadatoshi Fujimaki launched the original Kuroko no Basuke manga series in Weekly Shonen Jump magazine in 2008, and he ended the series in September 2014. Shueisha published the 30th and final compiled volume of the manga in Japan in December 2014.
In the beginning of the original series, Taiga Kagami has just enrolled at Seirin High School when he meets Tetsuya Kuroko of the school's basketball team. Kuroko happens to be the shadowy sixth member of the legendary "Generation of Miracles" basketball team. Together, Kagami and Kuroko aim to take their team to the inter-high school championship — against Kuroko's former teammates.
The original manga inspired three television anime series, in addition to the upcoming anime films. Viz Media announced last October that it will release the original manga in 2-in-1 omnibus editions in North America starting this summer.
BOSTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's executive order on Thursday making it easier for churches to dabble in politics kept faith with his promise to evangelical Christians who helped him win the White House, but could end up benefiting his opponents as well.

Leaders of the U.S. religious left, a rising force of opposition to Trump's hard-line stance on immigration and healthcare, said they were poised to benefit from the move, which lifts the risk of religious groups losing their tax-exempt status if they advocate for particular candidates.
“This is going to backfire on Trump,” said the Rev. Jennifer Butler, chief executive of progressive policy group Faith in Public Life. “We are morally outraged at what is going on and we are appalled at the weaponization of religion.”
The group plans to mobilize voters who view some of Trump's policies as immoral. While the group does not endorse candidates, those voters in the 2018 midterm elections would back candidates who oppose those policies. Trump's order gives religious groups more liberty to do so without jeopardizing tax-exempt status.
“We're going to be mobilizing millions of voters to turn out at the polls and vote their values,” Butler said.
Sojourners, a Washington-based progressive Christian network that advocates for immigrants and the poor, also believes more of its members will now feel free to speak out against Trump's policies.
“I wouldn't tell people who to vote for but I would tell them what to vote against and this might encourage more churches to speak out against him,” said Jim Wallis, the group's founder. “Donald Trump's use of racism and racial bigotry is unchristian. His attack on refugees is anti-Christian.”
Trump has repeatedly and angrily denied allegations that his policies are racist, calling immigration limits essential for national security. Before signing the order, the Republican president cited historically black churches and slain civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. as drivers of U.S. social progress.
‘SWORD OF DAMOCLES'
Evangelical and Roman Catholic leaders as well as a prominent U.S. rabbi joined Trump when he signed the order instructing the Internal Revenue Service to “alleviate the burden of the Johnson Amendment,” the 1954 law prohibiting organizations with tax-free status, including churches, from participating in political campaigns or supporting particular candidates.
The move by Trump, who appealed to religious conservatives in his 2016 presidential run, was widely praised by religious organizations that felt hemmed in by the law or openly violated it.
“We will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied or silenced any more,” Trump, who criticized the Johnson Amendment during his campaign, said at the ceremony. Rescinding the law would require an act of Congress.
Ralph Reed, a longtime leader of the religious right and chairman of the Faith & Freedom Coalition, praised Trump's executive order in a statement, saying it removed a “sword of Damocles that has hung over the faith community for decades.”
Several prominent leaders of the religious left noted that neither Republican nor Democratic policy stances lined up neatly with any major religion's teaching and said the move could fracture congregations by encouraging leaders to take sides.
“Once faith leaders become partisan, it hijacks their moral authority and their impartiality in this hyper-partisan environment,” said Rabbi Jonah Pesner, director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism.
The American Civil Liberties Union had threatened a lawsuit to stop the order, but later backed off, saying the most onerous provisions had yet to be enacted and that it fell far short of meeting Trump's pledge to “totally destroy” the Johnson Amendment.
Several leaders interviewed said they worried that Trump's move could be unevenly enforced, allowing conservative Christian churches to promote political candidates without extending the same exemptions to other views or other denominations.
“The biggest religious liberty issue now for me is how Christians are going to protect the liberty of Muslims,” said Wallis, of Sojourners. “That's the top issue, more than whether they have to hire gay people.”
Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said his group would keep urging U.S. imams to speak out on moral issues with political consequences, but would urge them to remain nonpartisan.
He wondered if all religious leaders would follow that guidance.
“This kind of moves, particularly by this administration, have a vast ocean of unintended consequences,” he said.
Royal Oak is about to unleash new regulations on dog owners.
The new rules, which go into effect Thursday, require owners of “dangerous dogs” to carry $1 million in liability insurance, post signs, complete an obedience class with the dog, and keep the dog in a locked, fenced-in area. Owners must also comply with seven pages worth of other requirements to keep their pets in the city.
Officials say a dog is deemed dangerous if it bites or attacks a person, or causes serious injury to another domestic animal. Exceptions include dogs protecting an owner or a homeowner's property.
City leaders say they created the ordinance after receiving 32 reports of dog bites and attacks during 2012 in Royal Oak.
Royal Oak resident John Scott said the ordinance is a good move for the city, putting the responsibility on the owners instead of the dogs.
“If you're a dog owner, you know that dogs are protective of their territory. There's an old saying that there's no bad dogs, just bad owners,” he said.
Lori Wosnicki, who has a Bernese Mountain Dog, she understands the reason for the new ordinance, but still thinks that it goes too far.
“Look at this dog, who goes to schools and has kids lay all over him. I have a really hard time with [the ordinance] because how do you decide what's dangerous,” she said.
Violation of the dog ordinance is a misdemeanor offense, punishable by a fine up to $500 and 90 days in jail.

Only men over 50 pray at Aqsa mosque amid tight security
Arab News
JERUSALEM: Muslim men over 50 prayed at the Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem's Old City on Friday amid intense security, a day after Israel closed all access to the sacred compound for the first time in more than a decade following violence on the streets.
More than 1,000 Israeli police were deployed around the Old City's cobbled streets and the ancient gates that lead to Al Aqsa, a spokeswoman said, in addition to undercover anti-riot units and observation balloons hovering in the sky.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas denounced Thursday's closure of the site as “tantamount to a declaration of war” and his political party called for a “day of rage” in protest at the move, prompting heightened security throughout the city.
Worshippers wanting to enter the ornate marble-and-stone compound, which contains the golden Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa mosque, the third holiest shrine in Islam, queued behind blue barricades to show their identification papers to the police.
More than 4,000 people attended midday prayers, police said. There were a few isolated disturbances, including firecrackers being set off and an attempt by a group of young Palestinian men to break through the police cordon, but no serious violence.
Israeli authorities shut all access to Al Aqsa after the shooting of Yehuda Glick, a far-right religious activist who has led a campaign for Jews to be allowed to pray at the site, which they refer to as Temple Mount.
Glick, 48, was shot as he left a conference in Jerusalem on Wednesday. The man suspected of shooting him, a Palestinian from the neighborhood of Abu Tor in the eastern, mainly Arab side of the city, was shot dead by Israeli forces before dawn on Thursday, following an exchange of gunfire.
Locals said it was the first time all access to Al Aqsa had been banned since the second Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, erupted in 2000. But Jordanian authorities, who are responsible for administering the site, said it was the first full closure of the compound since the 1967 Middle East war.
RELIGIOUS TENSIONS
Tensions have been high on the streets of East Jerusalem and around Al Aqsa for weeks, following the summer Gaza conflict and Israel's moves to expand settlement building in eastern areas of the city, which the Palestinians want as the capital of an independent state alongside the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
Al Aqsa is a particularly sensitive issue. The elegant 38-acre (15 hectare) compound, lined with cypress trees, houses the 7th century Dome of the Rock, from where the Prophet Muhammad is said to have ascended into heaven.
As well as its Islamic heritage, it was home to two ancient Jewish temples, the second of which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD, and is revered as the holiest site in Judaism.
According to rules agreed between Israel and Jordan after the 1967 war, while Jews are allowed to access Al Aqsa, they are not allowed to pray there. That status quo has stood without serious challenge for the past five decades.
However, Glick and his supporters, including a far-right member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, are determined to change the status quo, saying Jews have as much right to pray at Al Aqsa as Muslims.
Glick has even spoken of rebuilding a Jewish temple on the site, comments regarded as a deep incitement by Muslims.
While Netanyahu has repeatedly promised that the status quo will not change, his reassurances have done little to calm Palestinian concerns. Glick, an American-Israeli who lives in a settlement, has become a hate figure to many Palestinians.
Jordanian officials said Israel agreed to reopen Al Aqsa following a personal intervention by King Abdullah. They said Abdullah had emphasised that any continued closure would only heighten religious tensions, deepening a political conflict.
Israel and Jordan, which signed a peace accord 20 years ago this month, have a highly sensitive relationship. When it comes to issues of sovereignty over Islamic sites in Jerusalem, however, it is the Jordanians who hold the greatest sway.
Israeli police frequently limit access to Al Aqsa to women and Muslim men over the age of 40 or 50 when they are concerned about potential clashes at the site. It was not clear when the compound would be reopened to all Muslims.
“I normally go five times a day to pray, but the police are not letting me today,” said Ahmed Abu Zaaror, 21, who runs a stand selling pomegranate juice in the Muslim quarter of the Old City. Asked if he was angry at the situation he replied:
“What can I say? I have to keep all my anger inside.”
While Glick and his followers have managed to move their once marginal issue into mainstream discussion in Israel, many Jews still regard going up to Temple Mount as forbidden.
Ultra-Orthodox Jews who pray daily at the Western Wall, which sits under the Aqsa compound, said they would never go up to the Temple Mount above.
“We can't go there, it's forbidden by the Torah,” said Nathan Barzilai, 35, a Haredi Jew walking through the Muslim quarter of the Old City. “Only when the Messiah comes, but not until then.”
It's the news that so many of you have been waiting for, especially if you haven't been following the accompanying production blog, about the forthcoming ‘Storm' movie. Drumroll please…
The premiere of the animated version of what some see as the skeptics' anthem will be Saturday 16th October 2010 at the London Hilton Metropole, from 8pm 'til late and recently, tickets have been made available for £22.50 from here. The night will include special guests, chat, music, and, most importantly and obviously, the world premiere of the animated poem ‘Storm'.
Until now, tickets had only been available to people attending The Amazing Meeting (TAM) London, a two day skeptic conference that Tim will also be a part of, as well as Stephen Fry, Richard Dawkins, Alan Moore, Robin Ince and Graham Linehan, amongst others. I could tell you what Tim's doing, but then I'd have to kill you or face a severe telling off, but suffice to say, it will be brilliant. Tickets for the conference can be bought here.
Do come to at least one of them; it'll be fun.
And for those wondering, the animation will be heading to a few movie festivals before it gets uploaded to YouTube for the whole world to see. To stay informed of dates, be sure to keep an eye on the production blog.
Internet desert
Cuba has some of the worst internet access in the world, with just 5 percent of Cubans able to access the uncensored web.
Since the communist revolution of 1959, the Castro regime has enforced a strict ban on all forms of information flow that challenge official policy and history. Enforcing such censorship has been relatively easy for an island nation that has a monopoly over all media outlets. But when the internet arrived in the '90s, it complicated matters for the Castros.
Pioneers
Cuba's first 64KB/s internet connection came to life in 1996, making it one of the first countries to connect in the Caribbean region. Cuban technicians were resourceful, educated, and motivated to connect the country, which led to a surge in initial infrastructure development.
That surge soon stalled as the government realized the ramifications of allowing such a decentralized and uncontrollable network into the lives of the Cuban people. "The wild colt of new technologies can and must be controlled," warned Communications Minister Ramiro Valdés in 2007, summing up the regime's policy toward technology over the previous decade.
Getting online in Cuba
Connecting to the web in Cuba has historically been a matter of money and power. Some government insiders have dial-up internet in their homes. But for the rest of population, getting online has meant paying around $9 for one hour of internet access in state-run internet cafes. This in a place where an average salary is just over $20 per month.
Alternative methods include poaching wireless internet from hotels, which can be done if one person gets his hands on the wifi password and shares it. Many hotels in Havana now have security guards whose responsibility consists of shooing away these internet parasites from the sidewalks and benches surrounding the hotels.
Baby steps
"Cuba is like a pressure cooker. Frustration builds from all the lack of basic freedoms, and eventually the regime has to let out a little steam to keep everyone happy," says Jose Luis Martinez of Connect Cuba, an advocacy group based in Miami.
In July, the regime let out a little steam by installing 35 wifi hotspots throughout the island. Now, to connect, you can buy an access card for $2, which will give you one hour of access to the uncensored internet. These access cards are usually sold out, which has led to an informal street market where cards go for $3 or $4.
Is this an improvement? Perhaps. But 35 expensive hotspots for 11 million people is certainly not a significant step toward a freer internet. "Imagine if you told the island of Manhattan that they could only access the internet with 35 wifi hotspots. There would be riots in the street," says Martinez. "This is not progress."
The hotspots are located in tourist-dense downtown parks, not in places where typical Cubans spend their time. Martinez thinks the regime is creating the facade of progress to quell international criticism. "They are good at playing the international PR game, but this is still a very, very small step," he says. "I'm not hopeful."
The Cuban government has made efforts beyond the 35 hotspots. In April, the international telecoms office of the government announced a plan to connect all Cubans to the internet by 2020. How they will do this and what level of censorship the connection will have is not clear, but the announcement shows that the government recognizes the need for an expansion of internet access.
Reluctant to accept help
Last December's normalizing of relations between the US and Cuba brought with it new allowances for US telecoms companies to sell equipment to the island. Top Google executives have made several visits since the announcement, offering Google's infrastructure to help expand internet in Cuba.
But the regime is not likely to consider these offers. "Some want to give it to us for free, not so Cubans can communicate but to infiltrate us for ideological work. ... We have to possess the Internet our way, knowing the imperialists aim to use it to destroy the Revolution," said Vice President José Ramón Machado Ventura.
With $30 million of US federal money allocated for the "promotion of democracy in Cuba," the regime remains suspicious of any American-led initiatives, especially in a sector as politically sensitive as information technology.
So Cuba has turned to China, a model in how to keep a tight grip on the internet faucet. The 35 wifi hotspots use Chinese hardware, and two Chinese telecoms firms, ZTE and Huawei, have proposed a plan to connect the island by 2020. Cuba is much more likely to entertain a deal with China, given the two countries' parallel ideologies toward open information.
Momentum is building
As Cubans get a taste for the wonder that is the internet, they want more. As internal pressure grows, the Castro regime will likely continue to find creative ways to offer the internet without losing control of the flow of information. The opening of Cuba to foreign investment and travel will only speed up the process.
NEW YORK – Toyota gets all the love for ushering in the hybrid era with the Prius, but Porsche is here to say its founder had a hybrid on the road almost a century before those guys in Japan.
Porsche rolled into the New York Auto Show with Semper Vivus, a meticulous $750,000 reproduction of the series hybrid Ferdinand Porsche built in 1900. The car provided a nice contrast to the $95,000 Panamera S Hybrid making its North American debut at the show.
Semper Vivus, Latin for "always alive," works a lot like the Chevrolet Volt. Batteries provide juice to the hub-mounted motors, and a pair of tiny single-cylinder engines step in to drive two 2.5-kilowatt generators that keep electricity flowing when the batteries go kaput.
The specs are impressive, even by today's standards. The batteries have a range of 40 kilometers (25 miles). Once the 3.5-horsepower engines fire up, Semper Vivus can go another 160 kilometers (100 miles). Top speed is 35 mph, quite quick for its day. One cool bit: the tires were chiseled from solid blocks of rubber, the only way to support the weight of the car. Semper Vivus weighs 3,700 pounds.
Ferdinand Porsche, who had a background in electrical engineering, was fascinated by EVs and developed the original car with Viennese coachbuilder Ludwig Lohner. The car Porsche is showing in New York was meticulously recreated from the scant information squirreled away in the company's archives. Almost every part was fabricated from scratch, although the engines are the real deal. One was found in England, the other in France.
“The Porsche museum decided to rebuild this car in 2007. It represented a big challenge because nothing was in existence anymore," said Alchim Steiskal, director of the Porsche museum in Stuttgart. "All we have was one sketch and one drawing to go by."
Porsche's eager to carve out a piece of the hybrid market, and it's even taken gas-electrics racing. The Cayenne Hybrid S represents 18 percent of all Cayenne sales, and the Panamera Hybrid S is the most fuel-efficient car Porsche ever. By wheeling out a bit of its past, the company hopes people will look ahead to its future.

Porsche's first hybrid alongside it's latest, the Panamera S Hybrid. There will be some debate as to which looks better.

An Austin used-bookstore manager crusades for zero waste.
Perhaps you've unknowingly contributed to what used-bookstore managing librarian Mindy Reed calls “The Da Vinci Code syndrome.” Back in 2003, when the book came out, maybe you heard the buzz about the Dan Brown novel and tried to borrow it from the library. But since all the copies were checked out, you were put on the waiting list. A month later, after you'd moved from 250 to 150 on the list, you found yourself in an airport with nothing to read, so you gave in and bought the book. After your father moved into assisted living, you inherited his copy, too. When you cleaned out the garage, you hauled a box of books to Half Price Books, but with more than enough copies, the store declined yours. So you dropped it off at Recycled Reads — the used bookstore affiliated with the Austin Public Library system — and became part of Mindy Reed's headache.
“To this day, a week doesn't go by when we don't get a couple copies donated to us,” says Reed, the aptly named manager of Recycled Reads. “For a while, you could fill up this whole space with The Da Vinci Code. How many of those can you sell or resell when everyone's read it already?”
Not many, according to Reed, who has spent the last six years trying to develop a system for finding new homes and purposes for thousands of old copies of The Da Vinci Code, Tina Fey's Bossypants, and Elizabeth Gilbert's memoir Eat, Pray, Love. Opened in 2009, Recycled Reads processes 12 to 15 tons of materials a month — the equivalent of 70,000 bestsellers, textbooks and outdated encyclopedias. Although used bookstores affiliated with libraries are hardly unusual, Recycled Reads stands out for its emphasis on zero waste. The store sells as many books as it can, turns some of the rest into crafts, and partners with Goodwill and online reseller Thriftbooks to sell or recycle the leftovers.
The store is a sustainable destination not only for old library volumes but also for the castoffs of Austinites, many of whom likely have no inkling that the books they carefully place in single-stream recycling carts are not always recycled. Since hardback covers can clog recycling equipment and the glue in bindings degrades the quality of baled paper, books sent to be responsibly recycled may end up in landfills; it just takes too long to rip off their covers. Recycled Reads has developed a system for ensuring that every item from its deluge of books meets an environmentally friendly end.
Shifts in the publishing industry could also reduce waste, particularly if companies took advantage of digital technology to discriminate between books that should and should not be printed.
Over the years, Recycled Reads has prompted the Austin Public Library system to rethink its entire ordering process with sustainability in mind. The store also has earned national recognition: In 2013, it was awarded a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) to develop online training videos for other library systems hoping to start similar stores. In March, the industry publication Library Journal named Reed one of 50 “Movers and Shakers” because of her innovations at the store.
Still, for Reed, finding a green way to handle the byproduct of marketing frenzies that sell millions of copies of bestsellers requires looking beyond even recycling. “We set up this notion about this attachment we have to the container [of a book] because we all have such perfect memories of the first time we sat and read Winnie-the-Pooh or sitting on the floor and going through the World Book Encyclopedia to find what we want,” she says. “[But] the container that we call ‘the book' has been co-opted by all this other content that doesn't deserve that kind of admiration. I ask people, ‘Do you feel the same way about Snooki's book that you do about Pride and Prejudice? Do you feel the same way about an American Idol biography that you feel about Man's Search for Meaning?' We need to really think about the book that we want to really hold close to us … versus other stuff that gets put in this container that could [be conveyed] in better, sustainable ways.”
Before Recycled Reads opened, the nonprofit Friends of the Austin Public Library sold donated books and materials withdrawn from the library collection at “monster book sales.” Whatever didn't sell was set out on the sidewalk and marked “free.” But in 2007, a convergence of factors led Toni Lambert, assistant director for public services for the city library system, to take a new approach. She found a storefront among the consignment shops on Burnet Road, and hired Reed, a former head of purchasing and marketing in the tech industry and a second-career librarian, to manage the space as a used bookstore.
Over the years, Recycled Reads has prompted the Austin Public Library system to rethink its entire ordering process with sustainability in mind.
“At first I thought, ‘Oh, great, I'm going to be like Meg Ryan in You've Got Mail, Reed says. “She owns this little used bookstore, and it's very charming.” Then Reed was deluged with unwanted books, giant boxes of them from the library's 22 branches and donations from people downsizing, moving or cleaning out storage units. Pallets of books stacked up, floor to ceiling, in the store's back room. “I realized very quickly that if we didn't have a process for what to do with the books we couldn't sell, this thing was going to grind to a halt in a matter of months,” Reed says. “Suddenly I'm shifting from the idea of a dusty retail bookstore to a reuse and repurposing center.”
She came up with a system of multiple channels for old books. When donations arrive at the store's loading dock — sometimes at a rate of thousands of items per hour — they're triaged in the back room. The most valuable volumes are culled and sold online at Ebay and Alibris if they'll bring $15 or more. The rest of the salable stock — sheet music, vinyl records, VHS tapes, DVDs and maps as well as books — is stacked on the 5-foot metal shelves that line the blue-carpeted store. Hardcovers sell for $2, paperbacks for $1, children's books for 50 cents.
Some of the materials that don't get sold become the raw supplies for craft projects. Recycled Reads hosts Upcycle This!, a free monthly craft workshop that invites people to turn the materials into sheet-music flowers, compact-disc flowerpots and desktop mailboxes made from the pages of old books.
The rest of Reed's unsalable inventory is set aside for Goodwill Central Texas, which picks up 2 to 3 tons of materials every week, then sells them online or in its retail stores. If a copy of, say, a Twilight volume is collecting dust on a shelf, it may be transferred to the deeply discounted Goodwill outlet store, where clothes sell for $1.39 a pound and books are five for 99 cents. “We want to give everything every possible chance to continue its life as whatever product it is out in the community before we bring it into our recycling and salvage operation,” explains Kelly Freeman, director of sustainability for Goodwill Central Texas.
Books that don't sell at the Goodwill outlet are shipped to Thriftbooks, a national online used-book dealer that boasts 7 million items in stock at any given time. Books that the dealer can't sell or donate to charity are recycled into paper stock. Recycled Reads has started a pilot partnership with Thriftbooks, which pays the store 12 cents a pound for discarded materials. “We're always looking downstream, because we've taken this responsibility that we don't want anything to go into the landfill,” Reed says. “So we work with these other operations to make sure that if they take them, the next step is to reuse or recycle.”
Recycled Reads generates $11,000 to $12,000 in monthly sales, a considerable amount considering that all of its inventory is free. Recycled Reads also gets paid by the city government's Austin Resource Recovery, based on the volume of materials the store diverts from the landfill. With the expenses of rent, utilities and four staff salaries, Recycled Reads hasn't broken even yet, though Lambert, the library system's assistant director, says that's not her or the city's primary concern.
More to the point, Reed's system has been so effective it's become high profile in the quiet world of used bookstores, library systems and the people who work in both. The 2013 grant from IMLS recognized the store's pioneering zero-waste approach and its emphasis on the entire life cycle of library books. IMLS Senior Program Officer Sandy Toro said that while many libraries have bookstores, few have physical spaces focused on recycling, and Recycled Reads may be the only one that partners with Goodwill. “Something else that struck me is the sheer tonnage,” Toro says. “Since 2009, they've saved more than a thousand tons of materials from going into the landfill.”
As part of the grant, Recycled Reads surveyed librarians across the country about how they dispose of materials withdrawn from a library collection because of their age or condition. Only one-third of respondents said their libraries considered “end of life” for books at the time they were purchased. Almost 40 percent said that at least some weeded books were put in library dumpsters. “The field is lacking a general awareness of what needs to happen at the end of the life of a book,” Toro says. “I think that's something that this project brought to light.”
The entrepreneurial spirit and negotiating skills that Reed honed during her tech-industry career helped get Recycled Reads off the ground.
The entrepreneurial spirit and negotiating skills that Reed honed during her tech-industry career helped get Recycled Reads off the ground. Six years in the trenches of the used-book world have given her an unsentimental practicality not often associated with librarians and their collections. “Books are like lettuce — they have a shelf life,” she tells colleagues reluctant to get rid of outdated materials.
“Take paperback romances. Romance readers are voracious readers, but very few reread copies of a book, so the pipeline of those never ends. We've had people come in with boxes and boxes of them when, for instance, they clean out their mother's house when she moves to assisted living. All of a sudden we have every Harlequin romance that was ever published from 1987 to 2008. There's just not a market to resell those.”
Any solution to the glut of materials, she says, involves looking at the “whole ecosystem” of book production and consumption, “upstream” as well as “downstream.” While libraries have sustainability built into their mission — multiple people reuse copies of the same book — the ordering process for new materials isn't always green. In the IMLS training videos that Reed narrates, she urges librarians to consider the entire life cycle of books when they purchase them. How long will the book be used? What will happen when the enthusiasm for a particular bestseller inevitably wanes? Such considerations have become de rigueur in Austin; two years ago, the library system changed its acquisitions policy to reduce the number of copies of popular books it orders and instead encourages branches to share those volumes.
Shifts in the publishing industry could also reduce waste, particularly if companies took advantage of digital technology to discriminate between books that should and should not be printed. “Think about if publishers would encourage books like Fifty Shades of Grey to be digital,” Reed suggests. “Put all the digital content out that you want, eat it like candy, let it satiate you and then go away. Then [we can choose] the things that really deserve to be in this container that we are going to keep as an artifact as well as a purveyor of content.”
It sounds a bit provocative: Some works deserve to be in physical vessels while lesser writing should be consigned to digital transience. Who wants to get into the business of deciding which is which? But Reed says consumers already are making the distinction, and that's clear from the boxes of Twilight and The Hunger Games that she and her staff unpack every day. “I might enjoy reading these books, but I'm not necessarily going to want to hold onto them,” she says. “And from what we're seeing here, other people don't want to hold onto them either.”
Publishers could offer new releases as e-books first, then see if there's enough interest to make paperbacks and hardcovers. And print-on-demand technology, already adopted by self-published authors, may be part of the solution.
“One of the things I'm very conscious about before I make any purchase is the packaging, because I don't want to create extra waste,” Reed says. “This is about building a consciousness and starting a discussion.”

1. Who are you and what do you do in education?
I am a freelance English teacher from Brno, the second largest city in the Czech Republic (400.000 inhabitants) and I have been teaching English, with a short break during my maternity leave, for 8 years. I am originally Czech, I am 34, I have one daughter and I love being back in my hometown after many years of living in other countries and travelling/working around Europe. I spent a lot of time mainly in the US/the UK and Holland/Belgium. Apart from my mother tongue – Czech – I can speak English, Dutch and some French.
This is my 9th year of being a freelance ESL teacher and I couldn´t love my job more. I work both locally in Brno and online, via Skype and social media sites. I specialize in coaching others how to learn English without coursebooks, groups locally and individuals online. I believe it is much more effective, and also more fun, to learn a language through socializing, communicating with each other and by doing things we like and do in our own language.
So in my local courses we learn by doing. You can for example learn how to cook an Indian meal or we go to a bar with my American friend, who is a singer, and put together a blues song, we go shopping, watch and discuss movies and Ted talks… When I coach individual students I help them find the ways to stop being shy when speaking and motivate to listen, read and write for fun.
Sometimes I record the lessons, so if you go to my Youtube channel, you´ll see some of the lessons there. I also make grammar videos where I point the camera at myself and explain painful grammar issues and vocabulary in a simple way.
What gives me the greatest joy is building a community of students who feel language learning doesn´t belong to schools with desks and coursebooks. And helping someone realize they can aim high, set their goals and achieve them, that is the most rewarding moment for me.
2. Describe a typical work day in your life!
I start working around 9am and I usually don´t finish before midnight. In between there is quite a lot of role-switching, from online coach to blogger to social media expert to videomaker, to in-class teacher, to event organizer and a mom. Most of the time I coach students online in the mornings and teach local group courses in the afternoons. Now more than ever, I seek some downtime and some social time for myself in my weekly schedule. It´s very important, otherwise I would go crazy.
3. In what way has technology in general and the net in particular changed your work?
It has changed my life completely. I used to work with coursebooks and cds, sometimes dvd-roms. Now everything´s on the internet. It´s so easy and mainly for free. I honestly don´t understand how some people can still be teaching from coursebooks. Hello! The world has changed, I feel like screaming sometimes… The whole world is on Facebook, all the answers to your questions are on Google, everyone´s blogging, making videos, sharing, creating. The past two years have turned education upside down, flipped it ;).
What an opportunity to help thousands of students and build your PLN (personal learning network) from the comfort of your home! Before my lessons were limited to those who could attend my courses locally, now everyone can learn with me through my videos, my FB page/my blog and I am planning to build a videocourse in the near future where students can learn how to learn.
4. What challenges do you see for education in the future?
This is a question I am afraid to answer for myself. Because I am a bit pessimistic when it comes to my country and I have a child for whom I have to decide which road to také, very soon. And the options are not that great, sadly. In the majority of state and private schools, the child is still not considered a unique person, the teachers are still underpaid and despite the neverending debates on how investing in education should be a priority there is still so little money being put into general education. It feels almost pointless to send my child to a school when I know she´s not going to learn things the way she needs to learn them. Do we end up like the Greeks where everyone pays for the private teachers after school so that their kids could pass the exams?

Nina Hanáková: Learning doesn't belong to schools with desks and coursebooks Has this been helpful?
When it came to live-action television series, Marvel for the past few years was only in the ABC and Netflix business. But that changed in February, when the company teamed with FX for the new drama, Legion.
Created by Fargo's Noah Hawley, the trippy, visually breathtaking drama is based on a character from Marvel's X-Men comics, and follows David Haller (Downton Abbey's Dan Stevens), who was told all his life he's mentally ill but realizes he actually has mutant, psychic powers.
Legion has been an early hit, ranking second among all scripted cable series in the 18-49 demo (in live-plus-3) during its first four weeks, behind only The Walking Dead. On Wednesday, FX ordered a second season of the show, which will air in 2018.
In a statement announcing the renewal, Jeph Loeb, a Legion executive producer and the head of Marvel Television, noted, “We're particularly proud of our partners at FX and the success we share on our first TV series together.”
So how did those two distinct and seemingly contrasting brands team up to create a new hit show?
“It's been remarkably easy,” said John Landgraf, the CEO of FX Networks and FX Productions. “Part of it is because I just really like Jeph Loeb and the people that work with him, and he seems to like to me. I really respect him creatively and I think he's a fan of FX and its brand.”
Together, said Landgraf, “we've been partnered in supporting Noah. … His ambitions are so great that he's always going to take you to places that are initially scary or confusing before they gel, but we and Marvel seemed resolutely committed to Noah and exactly the show that Noah wanted to make from the beginning.”
The show Hawley envisioned was one that blended elements from both companies, as he explained to Adweek in February. “That appealed to me, this idea that the struggle over morality is never fixed. It's constant. And characters that are good under the right circumstances can do bad things. That felt like the FX show,” Hawley said. “Then on the Marvel side, there is a sense that the readers of these comics—and I saw it at Comic-Con—a huge part of the fan base feels like they don't fit in. These stories are metaphorical for them, about defining themselves instead of being defined by society. So it felt like the perfect kind of balance.”
To help Hawley maintain that balance, FX and Marvel made a key decision when it came to working with Hawley and giving him feedback—they are going to be partners, not rival suitors. “We were always going to give notes together,” Landgraf said. “FX wasn't going to talk to Noah and then Marvel was going to talk to him; that means we were going to talk to each other.”
And both sides lived up to the agreement during production of Legion's first season. “Marvel and Jeph have made contributions that are different than ours, and we've probably made some contributions that are different than theirs,” Landgraf said. “But that's around the margins. Eighty percent we've agreed, and we've never had a substantial creative disagreement. Our point of view was always, ‘Look, if we do have a disagreement, we're just going to have to debate, and the best idea is going to win.' But we've never even had a debate. We just really agreed. So it's been great, honestly.”
Marvel's next TV collaboration will also be with the Fox Networks Group. The company is shooting a Fox pilot in contention for next season. Tentatively titled Gifted, it's also set in the X-Men world of mutants and was written by Burn Notice creator Matt Nix.
ECHO PARK –– One man was shot Friday night after a group was thrown out of an Echo Park bar on Sunset Boulevard, police said.
The shooting took place at Little Joy at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Portia Street after one of the suspects who had been thrown out of the bar returned and opened fire, said Lt. Richard Parks with the LAPD Northeast Division. The victim was shot in the leg, and his injury is not believed to be life threatening, he said.
Police dogs were used to help apprehend three suspects, two males and a female, at about 4 a.m. on Saturday near Glendale Boulevard and Aaron Street after police sealed off the area. A police helicopter circled overhead for several hours during the search.
One of the male suspects will be booked on attempted murder, Parks said. It's not clear if the other two will face charges, he said.

As pastor, a Christian and a parent, I oppose Initiative 1515's attempt to repeal our state's nondiscrimination protections.
AS an evangelical Lutheran pastor, I've humbly tried throughout my life to live out Christ's commandment to love our neighbors as ourselves — including those who may seem different from us. It's a core part of how I live my Christian faith, and the example my wife and I want to set for our daughters.
Like many people, there was a time when I didn't know much about what it meant to be transgender. Because so few of us personally know a transgender person, the idea of a person being born one gender but knowing themselves to be another can sound unusual, confusing and may be a bit uncomfortable at first. I'll admit it was for me.
Then, through my ministry, my wife and I came to know some transgender people and their families and learned of the discrimination they sometimes face. That experience really opened my eyes to the suffering of folks in our community, whomI realized I knew little about.
I've reflected back on that experience recently as I've been hearing about other states that have proposed or passed new laws allowing discrimination against transgender people in public places, including in public restrooms. Now, a proposed Washington ballot initiative, Initiative 1515, seeks to roll back discrimination protections for transgender people — legal protections that have been in place for 10 years.
The supporters of I-1515 say safety and privacy are their goals. As a husband and the father of four daughters, it's only natural to worry about the well-being of our families and children, especially when we hear so many tragic stories about people victimized by physical assaults or sexual violence. When we're anxious or concerned, it's important to step back and get the facts.
That's why I listen to our law enforcement and violence-prevention experts. These leaders, including King County Sheriff John Urquhart, former Snohomish County Sheriff John Lovick and the Washington Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs, know that nondiscrimination laws permitting transgender men and women to use public facilities that match their gender are not, and have never been, a threat to anyone's safety. In fact, they say I-1515 would do nothing to improve public safety. It might even make things worse by encouraging strangers to confront and question others in public facilities and violate each other's privacy and safety.
As a pastor, Christian and parent, I oppose I-1515's attempt to repeal our state's nondiscrimination protections. Doing so would single out our transgender neighbors for different treatment and potentially put their safety at risk and would have unintended consequences for all of us.
My wife and I have prayed about this and come to believe that protecting people from discrimination is about treating others as we want to be treated. We're all God's children — including people who are transgender — and we should all be treated equally under the law.
As you search your heart, I hope you'll join me and many other parents and faith leaders who are standing up against I-1515's repeal of Washington's discrimination protections for transgender people. Support Washington Won't Discriminate: WashingtonWontDiscriminate.org.

A new hair care company called eSalon.com is infuriating hairstylists across the country… with one great hair coloring job at a time!
In recent press, the company said it's fast becoming a target for stylists: “Outraged stylists say, ‘How could you do this? You're going to put us out of business!'”
Maybe It's because eSalon offers the same salon service but in your own home. Plus, it's more affordable and comes with the personal guidance of color experts – so you get the full salon treatment without paying a fortune.

And for the ultimate convenience, they deliver it to your door, all for under $20.00. That's a far cry from the $100 plus you would pay at a salon!
And it sounds like hair salons are feeling the heat. “Sometimes we're reluctant to tell other colorists what we do,” says one eSalon's colorist. “But mostly we're proud of the service we offer busy, professional women.”
Customized color truly makes a difference. eSalon has already received kudos from InStyle, Total Beauty, Good Housekeeping and a handful of other high-profile sites.

Six Republican senators are asking Secretary of Defense Leon E. Panetta personally to intervene to ensure that U.S. troops stationed away from home get the chance to register and vote in the upcoming election.
They say Pentagon officials are ignoring a 2009 law that ordered the military to set up a special voting-assistance office at every U.S. base around the world, to make sure troops can negotiate the confusing patchwork of 50 different sets of state registration and absentee voting requirements, and get their ballots mailed in time.
“The price of [the Department of Defense's] failure to follow the law will likely be paid this November by military service members and their families, whose voting rights were to have been safeguarded by this provision,” wrote U.S. Republican Sens. John Cornyn of Texas, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, John Barrasso of Wyoming, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Saxby Chambliss of Georgia and James Inhofe of Oklahoma.
“Many of the on-base voter assistance offices that do exist are grossly inadequate, and at least half of them are either closed or completely unstaffed,” states the letter, sent to Mr. Panetta Friday.
“We request a timely response on what you intend to do to ensure that our military service members and their families receive the voter assistance they need in order to participate in the democratic process this November,” the letter concludes.
Earlier this week, the Pentagon inspector general released a report saying investigators had been unable to contact voting-assistance offices at just over half of the U.S. military's 229 bases across the globe. But Pam Mitchell, the acting director of the Federal Voting Assistance Program at the Pentagon, said they were using outdated contact information.
“I strongly believe that voting-assistance is the best that it has ever been,” she said.
A Pentagon spokeswoman said she had nothing to add to Ms. Mitchell's remarks, made Wednesday at a briefing for reporters.
Mr. Panetta “responds to all members of Congress and will respond to the senators directly,” Navy Cmdr. Leslie Hull-Ryde said.
Ms. Mitchell will testify next week before a House Armed Services Subcommittee and will face “tough questions” according to a staffer.

About
About me and my Campaign. My name is John Antony Dunne. I am of Anglo Irish decent and I am 45 years of age on the 27th of September. I have had many jobs over the years from being a Barman, Security Guard, Milkman, Truck Driver. In 1998 I was involved in a serious Car accident that left me with a serious long term problem with my knee and in 2002 a truck accident only aggravated the problem. It was time to find alternative employment because I was unable to easily drive a manual vehicle due to the fault being with my left knee. after being unemployed for two years after the truck accident I decided to go back to college and study Garden and landscape design as the job I had prior to the truck driving job was as a Landscape maintenance operative for Sodexho. after that I was unemployed for a further three years as Starting my own landscape design business only netted me one customer in a whole year. In march of 2008 I managed to land a dream job in the field of design for a Building Engineering Consultancy but due to the Recession I was made redundant in April of the following year. For the past 6 years I have struggled to get back into work in my field of Design due to lack of Qualifications in specific computer Programs. I learnt Sketch up in my last employment and took an Auto-CAD course in 2012-2013 which I Passed. Starting this Business is important to me as I have no real chance of finding work because no company likes to employ people that have been out of work for so long regardless of the passion and skills. It will also help a few of my unemployed friends get back into work one is an ex soldier that served in the Gulf and due to injury needs to be able to work at his own pace rather than the stress of a corporate atmosphere. he also needs to be able to provide for his fiance Step Daughter and soon to arrive in Twin Girls. to secure a good future for them. Using My Qualifications in Auto-CAD and Skills in Carpentry and Sketch up I decided back in December last year to Design some children s cabin beds and start a Facebook page to see how many people would be interested in the Idea. Although Custom Built beds similar to mine are on the market they are extremely expensive and lack allocated storage space so I decided I should fill this hole in the market and design beds that are not only fun for the children but have practical storage solutions built in. After months of research I have secured a supplier for some of the Ironmongery components for the beds. The actual timber components I will have to design and cut myself as every CNC company I have tried is far too expensive for just cutting the individual timber components. This i will have to do myself with the help of some friends that are willing to help me out. The Contributions would help secure A reasonable size premises to rent for the first year, A vehicle in which to deliver and install the beds, Tools and materials to make the Display beds so that we can produce a Catalog of the products that can be Published on the internet and some hard copies to send out to potential retailers. it will also help towards the first months wages and costs for the business for at least two of my staff even if I have to work for next to nothing I would not expect them to even if they have guaranteed to help me to help me start the business for no wages to start.
Risks and challenges Risks & Challenges.
Like with any new Business there are risks and Challenges.
Not getting enough Customers is both a risk and a challenge With my low Target of 4 Units a week for the first year I sincerely hope to exceed that after the first six months. As I have already generated Interest on Facebook ( www.facebook.com/customcabinbeds ) by starting a separate page for the Business it has had over 150 likes in the past six months and three genuine inquiries that are 90% certain to lead to a sale so that is three of the first four required for the first week of business. I have many connections all over the world and have a Friend that works for a Major Los Angeles Publication that will be doing a piece for me when the business is up and running so the export potential of the products is also a definite possibility.
The challenge will be to meet the demand by the Customers with such a small team to start with. I have many friends that are willing to help me out with market Research and some maybe able to give up a few hours during the weekend to help with production.
Once sufficient Profit allows a financial return back into the business then expansion can be achieved and more staff can be employed.
I have held a supervisory position in previous Jobs so being able to pull a good team together to get the business up and running but with most of the immediate staff being friends then I foresee good Communication and team work for what they will be doing.
With Articles in various magazines and a professional website advertising the products as well as some non corporate retailers willing to sell the products through their outlets this should solve the lack of customer problems.
The Staffing problem that may occur if the orders come in could be solved through Work Experience Students from local Schools and Colleges. for the short term and when the financial status of the business increases then Staff and a bigger premise can be sort after.
I have a good Circle of friends and there are many people I know that would welcome the work as a challenge and they all have a group of friends of their own that Would probably enjoy helping out even for a few hours.
I am good at solving problems and I am sure that with my team between us we can overcome any challenges that come our way. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
A protest Thursday against the province's' new sex-ed curriculum more than half-emptied the Toronto school that has been at the centre of discontent. Almost 740 students were absent from Thorncliffe Park Public School, with just 532 in class.

Numbers for the Fraser Mustard Academy, the all-kindergarten school next door, were not immediately available, though past protests have hit the school too. Parents across the province were urged to pull their kids out of school Thursday and a rally was planned outside Thorncliffe, though by 11:30 a.m. about 200 parents and children had turned up. They were planning to form a human chain around the school.

Eight police officers were also on hand, one on his bike who chatted and laughed with some of the children there.
"There was a need for this comeback. I mean, it's in the theme song: 'Gotta get back.'"
Phil LaMarr is having a very busy 2017.
In addition to wrapping up the final season of Samurai Jack, the fan-favorite animated epic 16 years in the making, the prolific voice actor also turned in a starring role as Aquaman and Green Lantern in the best-selling DC fighting game Injustice 2. If that weren't enough, LaMarr is also set to voice-star in Tyler, the Creator's upcoming Adult Swim animated comedy The Jellies.
LaMarr, in a recent interview on the Namek vs. Saiyan podcast, hosted by The Hollywood Reporter's Patrick Shanley, opened up about his many roles and ruminated on the emotional finale to Samurai Jack, which returned to Adult Swim this year after a 13-year hiatus.
"It's lovely to come back and work with your friends again, but there was something really special about this show," LaMarr said of the return. "For me, even originally, it was a show that I loved. I consider it a work of art. There was a need for this comeback. I mean, it's in the theme song: ‘Gotta get back.' [Samurai Jack creator] Genndy Tartakovsky and I had been talking on and off for nearly a decade about finishing, because it needed an ending."
As for the ending itself, LaMarr believes it speaks for itself and fans need to accept Tartakovsky's vision. "Last time I checked, you didn't write it or create or draw it, so I don't know why it would be exactly what you wanted," he said of critics of the finale's bittersweet conclusion. "It's what Genndy wanted. You wouldn't say, 'I think the Mona Lisa would be better if she just smiled. Come on, Da Vinci, lighten up. Go in and redo it.'"
As for his work on Injustice 2, the actor credits his past efforts on the animated series Young Justice for landing him the role. "I think the reason they used me on Injustice was because their concept for Aquaman was pretty similar to the Young Justice Aquaman — the regal, 'I am the king of the seven seas,'" LaMarr said. "He's really, almost, a less schmucky Namor."
Due to the current video game actors strike, however, LaMarr was worried about his work in the game reaching fans. "Thankfully, we'd done all the Injustice work before we went on strike. I wasn't sure when the game came out if I would be in it," he said. "I'm a DC comics guy from way back, so these characters are very dear to me. Plus, as a performer, I've been in this world since 2000. I love this work. It's a real bummer to think that until we get this settled, I won't be able to play these guys anymore."
The current strike is ongoing.
Twenty years ago, a group of artists left Marvel Comics to create their own company, a company that continues to influence mainstream comics and culture to this day. Image Comics began as more than just a publisher -- it was a response to years of creator mistreatment, and it changed comics forever.
Comics in Focus: The Image Revolution will tell the story of Image Comics, from its founders' work at Marvel, through Image's early days, the ups and downs of the '90s, and the publisher's new generation of properties like The Walking Dead. We will tell the company's story through new interviews with the people who made it happen. And what better time than during Image's 20th anniversary to make this documentary?
The film will be produced by the same team behind the critically-acclaimed documentaries Grant Morrison: Talking with Gods and Warren Ellis: Captured Ghosts. It will be directed by Patrick Meaney and produced in partnership by Sequart Research & Literacy Organization and Respect Films.
This will be the second (after Comics in Focus: Chris Claremont's X-Men) in a new series of documentaries offering in-depth looks at significant works and moments that shaped comics history. These documentaries will be released through direct download and online DVD sales.
We have turned to Kickstarter to help fund this project. This is your chance to support discussion about the merits of comics and to help document stories about the people who have had a part in shaping contemporary pop culture.
Rewards include the documentary as a DVD and / or a digital download, a “THANKS” (and other credits) in the film, and digital access to extra interview footage not included in the film. Other rewards include books and films from Sequart's library:

WASHINGTON, Nov. 9 (UPI) -- After President Obama nominated New York prosecutor Loretta Lynch for attorney general, Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Mike Lee, R-Utah, threatened to block her.
In a statement released on Saturday, the senators claim the current Congress should not decide the fate of the nominee, since many have lost their seats, and they want to know her opinion on President Obama's executive amnesty plans before confirming her.
"The nominee must demonstrate full and complete commitment to the law," the statement says. "Loretta Lynch deserves the opportunity to demonstrate those qualities, beginning with a statement whether or not she believes the President's executive amnesty plans are constitutional and legal."
The president has said he would prefer Congress to pass immigration reform, but will use executive action soon if nothing progresses soon. His plan could allow up to 5 million undocumented immigrants to remain in the country temporarily.
Pay attention, Simpson and Bowles: There are some things in life worse than going into debt.
For Apple Inc., that worse thing is paying taxes: The company announced plans Tuesday evening to borrow money for the first time ever, despite having nearly $145 billion in cash. The problem is that $102 billion of that cash is parked overseas and would be taxed if Apple tried to use it in its plan to give money back to shareholders.
"We are continuing to generate significant cash offshore, and repatriating this cash would result in significant tax consequences under current U.S. tax law," Apple Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer said on a conference call discussing Apple's earnings for the quarter that ended in March.
Apple's earnings haven't exactly been setting the world on fire quite enough lately to satisfy finicky shareholders. So the company is under increasing pressure to give its shareholders a taste of its cash. It finally succumbed on Tuesday, saying it plans to pay out $100 billion by the end of 2015, in the form of stock buybacks and a higher dividend. That will amount to about $30 billion per year, according to Oppenheimer, which would just about take up all of Apple's "tax-free" cash flow, as he put it.
If Apple didn't borrow money, then it would have to, gasp, bring cash back home to help pay for its shareholder-greasing. And bringing Apple's offshore cash back home could result in a tax hit of up to $35 billion, assuming it pays the full statutory corporate tax rate (which doesn't happen very often). Analysts for months have been prodding Apple to borrow money to avoid the hit, and Apple has been listening, apparently.
In preparation for Apple's borrowing, credit-rating agencies have given Apple a credit rating for the first time. Ironically, Apple has the exact same credit rating from Standard & Poor's that the United States of America has: AA+. The U.S. government got its credit-rating cut from AAA because of its fiscal problems and could sort of use that $35 billion in cash Apple is potentially avoiding paying.
But instead of grumbling about Apple, maybe the government could learn something from it: Namely, that it's not always a bad idea to borrow money. And when interest rates are being held near record lows by the Federal Reserve, there may never be a better time to borrow.
"With interest rates at rock-bottom, it's a good time to borrow for any company," said Darren Hayes, a professor at Pace University's Seidenberg School. "It's wise for companies to borrow when interest rates are low."
The U.S. government has even better use for the borrowed cash than Apple's tax-avoidance: It could spend money to help stimulate the economy and bring down unemployment.
Instead, policymakers in Washington tend to listen too much to people like Erskine Bowles, who along with Alan Simpson continues to push his plan to slash government debt, on the principal that debt is evil. As a result, the government has spent much of the past two years squeezing spending, at a time when borrowing has never been cheaper.
Healing energy streams flow from portal to portal as Gaia balances with Hue-manity and humanity (smaller h) energies.
Light Workers called to portal adjustments are encouraged to follow healing energy flow within, as this aligns with the Gaia Healing energy streams, and will lead each to their Gaia healing portal center.
As Hue-manity aligns, and more and more of humanity (smaller h) begins to align, with these healing energy streams, and accepts those processes within themselves, Gaia rests in the resulting peace, and needs not the “catastrophic” adjustments previously thought necessary.
Those promoting the “doom and/or gloom catastrophe” scenarios will find difficulty in expressing those ideas, as their time is over. The current energetic state of Gaia does not support, in any way, that type of energy intent.
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union nations can deny benefits to EU migrants unless they have previously worked in their host country, the EU's top lawyer said on Thursday, in a case brought by Germany and keenly watched in Britain.
Even actively seeking work is not enough of a justification to claim benefits at the same time, European Court of Justice Advocate General Melchior Wathelet said.
His opinion, which judges must consider in their final ruling, was likely to be welcomed by Eurosceptic parties in the 28-nation EU which argue that governments must do more to stop “benefit tourism” by EU migrants.
Wathelet's view reinforces the precedent set by a November ruling that said EU migrants can be denied benefits if they move to a country with no intention of finding a job. [ID:nL6N0T1262]
“This confirms that the right to live and work elsewhere in the EU is not the same as the right to claim benefits,” said Catherine Bearder, a British liberal in the European Parliament.
Immigration has become a divisive topic in Europe as it struggles to recover from years of economic crisis.
British Prime Minister David Cameron repeated his call last week for a “wide-scale change to the rules on welfare and benefits”, in a reference to popular suspicion that EU immigrants come to Britain to scrounge off the state.
Cameron has promised that, if he wins a May election, he will renegotiate Britain's relationship with Europe on issues such as immigration and then hold a referendum on its membership of the bloc by 2017.
In his opinion, the European Court of Justice's Wathelet said however that those who had worked in their host country should not be penalised.
Germany was therefore wrong to stop benefits to a Swedish mother who became unemployed, Wathelet said.
Swedish mother-of-three Nazifa Alimanovic stopped receiving social benefits in Germany in 2012 after becoming unemployed. Alimanovic had worked in Germany between June 2010 and May 2011. Germany's Federal Social Court brought the case to the EU court.
“Exclusion from social assistance benefits, provided for by the German legislation, is not applicable to the situation of Ms Alimanovic,” Wathelet said.
Alimanovic's three children had been born in Germany and attended school there.
Well at last we can safely break the story after it has been reported in the Spanish press that the Latics are to sign Osasuna striker Oriol Riera.
The 27 year old frontman will cost a reported ?2.5m with the La Liga club negotiating to receive the cash up front.
Riera came through the Barcelona academy though only featured for the C and B teams, he moved to Celta Vigo in 2010 before dropping down to the Segunda Division with Cordoba and then Alcoron, he impressed whilst at Alcoron and Osasuna splashed the cash last summer to take Riera to Pamplona.
A good campaign last with Osasuna saw Riera score 13 goals in 37 appearances, including 2 against Real and 1 goal against Atletico.
Waiting for official confirmation from the Latics, but this looks a nailed on deal.

Honeybees have been dying in record numbers, threatening the continued production of nutritious foods such as apples, nuts, blueberries, broccoli, and onions. Without bees to pollinate these crops, the environmental ecosystem—and our health—stands in the balance. Have we reached the tipping point, where the plant-pollinator system is due to collapse?
There was no way to calculate that—until now.
Using statistical physics, Northeastern network scientist Albert-László Barabási and his colleagues Jianxi Gao and Baruch Barzel have developed a tool to identify that tipping point—for everything from ecological systems such as bees and plants to technological systems such as power grids. It opens the door to planning and implementing preventive measures before it's too late, as well as preparing for recovery after a disaster.
The tool, described in a new paper published on Wednesday in the prestigious journal Nature, fills a longstanding gap in scientists' understanding of what determines “resilience”—that is, a system's ability to adjust to disturbances, both internal and external, in order to remain functional.
“The failure of a system can lead to serious consequences, whether to the environment, economy, human health, or technology,” said Barabási, Robert Gray Dodge Professor of Network Science and University Distinguished Professor in the Department of Physics. “But there was no theory that considered the complexity of the networks underlying those systems—that is, their many parameters and components. That made it very difficult, if not impossible, to predict the systems' resilience in the face of disturbances to those parameters and components.”
“Our tool, for the first time, enables those predictions,” said Barabási, who is also a leader in Northeastern's Network Science Institute.
Taking a system's temperature
Barzel, a postdoctoral fellow in Barabasi's lab who collaborated on the research and is now at Bar-Ilan University, draws an elegant analogy between the role of temperature in identifying that tipping point in a pot of water and the single parameter—a temperature equivalent, as it were—that their tool can uncover to identify the tipping point in any complex system.
Consider: 100 degrees Celsius is the tipping point for water changing from liquid to vapor. Think of liquid as the desirable state for the system and vapor as the undesirable one, signifying collapse. Millions of parameters and components quantify what is going on within that pot of water, from the relationship of the water molecules to one another to their speed and the chemical bonds linking their elements.
As the water heats up, those parameters and components continually change. Measuring those multitudinous changes over time—a microscopic approach to assessing the water's state—would be impossible. How, then, are we to know when the water is reaching the threshold that divides the desirable (liquid) state from the undesirable (vapor) state?
Simple: Using a single parameter—temperature. As the water in the pot reaches, say, 99 degrees Celsius, alarms go off and we know to remove it from the heat.
“Statistical physics has found that you can crunch down all of these millions of parameters and components into one number—the temperature,” said Barzel. “We take it for granted now, but that was a tremendous scientific achievement.”
The researchers' tool similarly crunches down all the parameters and components of any complex system into a single crucial number. It enables us, essentially, to take the system's “temperature” to determine its health and respond accordingly.
“We collect all the data and map it to one number, a universal resilience curve,” said Gao, a postdoc in Barabási's lab. “That's the only number we need in order to quantify whether the system is on the desirable or undesirable side of the threshold, or even approaching the danger zone.”
From theory to application
Of course, the interaction between, say, bees and plants in an ecological system is not the same as the interaction between water molecules in a pot, noted Barzel. “But the way of thought and the mathematical tools that we use—statistical physics—are very similar.”
A big difference, however, is that we know how to prevent the water system from collapsing: Turn off the heat before the temperature reaches 100 degrees Celsius. Indeed, the water system on its own provides a visible clue as it approaches the tipping point: bubbles. You can't say the same for the dying bees. The problem leads naturally to the researchers' next steps: Using statistical physics both to detect trouble in a system early on and to bring about its recovery if it has crossed the threshold.
“Once you identify the relevant parameter that controls the system's resilience, you can begin to tackle how to manipulate that resilience—how to enhance resilience or restore resilience,” said Gao. “These are not easy questions, but our theory, by giving us a picture of the entire system, paves the way to the answers.”
A billboard in Calgary reads: “The sun is the main driver of climate change. Not you. Not CO2.” It was funded by the poorly-named group FriendsofScience.org (which I'll come back to later).
The billboard's message takes aim at the idea of anthropogenic climate change or any possible effects of greenhouse gasses. Allow me to state outright, in no uncertain terms, that this claim does not represent the vast majority of scientific data.
The claim that the Sun is chiefly responsible for climate change doesn't have much merit. Studies have shown that slight fluctuations in solar activity actually don't affect Earth that much. Of the 1°C the planet has warmed in the last 300 years, a study found that the Sun probably contributed to less than 0.15°C of that. Any data that does point the finger of blame toward the Sun does not fit observational trends as well as humanity's production of pollution. Claiming that humans and CO2 are not to blame doesn't comport with the evidence and disagrees with the vast majority of the scientific literature.
Now, let's get down to the sponsoring group itself. Friends of Science (FoS) was founded in 2002 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. On their website, they describe claims of anthropogenic influence on the climate as “weak science” and decry public policies founded on that information. They also describe the belief in those causes as “cult indoctrination” and those who support it as “religionists.” On the most basic level, a reputable organization advocating science would not resort to name calling for anyone who disagrees.
There are other clues that FoS isn't all it claims to be, in the form of receiving money from petroleum companies. In 2006, Charles Montgomery published an exposé for Globe and Mail, illustrating the money to be made and the political power to be had in perpetuating the rumor that the scientific community hasn't come to a consensus. If voters aren't confident in the science, they can be persuaded. Most importantly, there's no way to regulate what the claims of people like those from FoS. They can spread as many fallacies as they want, and there's not a lot that can be done about it.
FoS releases articles describing current research in climate change, and they may speak to groups or get on TV, but it isn't put through the scrutiny of peer review. That review process is a critical part of scientific integrity, but is lacking in the claims of FoS. It's a lot easier to say whatever you want when nobody is checking your work over to ensure it is accurate or done in good faith.
At the end of the day, which group seems like the one with the agenda? The diverse group of the majority of scientists from around the world who collect and interpret data under limited budgets and who just so happen to agree on several major points? Or the group with ties to the petroleum industry that admits to pushing a particular slant on scientific data that is advocating against environmentally-responsible policy, which would hurt said petroleum industry?
This billboard's content is complete nonsense.

The Government was on Thursday night urged to open an inquiry after officials found signs that birth rates for girls and boys vary noticeably according to where their mothers were born.
A health minister said that these differences in rates of male and female births among mothers of certain nationalities may “fall outside the range considered possible without intervention”.
It forms the first official statistical evidence potentially backing up concerns that sex-selection abortions are being carried out in Britain.
Andrew Lansley, the former health secretary, last year criticised the “illegal and morally wrong” practice following a Daily Telegraph investigation into the issue.
After this newspaper received information that the procedures were becoming increasingly common for cultural and social reasons, undercover reporters filmed doctors offering women terminations based on gender.
As a result of the investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service is considering criminal charges against doctors in three cases.
The practice of aborting unborn babies on the basis of sex has long been considered a problem in areas of India and China, where boys are sometimes considered favourable for cultural or economic reasons.
There has been little official research on whether the practice is carried out in some of Britain's immigrant communities. The Government said its new analysis was undertaken after the Council of Europe demanded statistics on the issue of whether more boys than girls are born to mothers of certain nationalities.
Earl Howe, a health minister, disclosed the Government's preliminary statistics in answer to a parliamentary question by Lord Alton of Liverpool, a crossbench peer and former MP who campaigns against abortion.
“While the overall United Kingdom birth ratio is within normal limits, analysis of birth data for the calendar years from 2007 to 2011 has found the gender ratios at birth vary by mothers' country of birth,” the Tory minister said.
“For the majority of groups, this variation is the result of small numbers of births and does not persist between years. However, for a very small number of countries of birth there are indications that birth ratios may differ from the UK as a whole and potentially fall outside of the range considered possible without intervention.”
The evidence is preliminary and, therefore, it is still possible that the differing birth ratios are the result of “natural variation”. Lord Howe said officials will continue to “monitor” the issue and analyse the data.
He rejected Lord Alton's request for data to be collected on the sex of unborn babies at the time of abortion. The minister said recording the gender of foetuses “raises ethical and clinical issues”.
Last night, Lord Alton said the presence of sex-selective abortion in the UK could be a product of terminations becoming too “routine”.
“Abortion has become so routine in Britain with 600 taking place every day that people have accepted the mantra that it's just a matter of choice but that's not what the law says,” he said. “There is a fundamental debate to take place here.”
He said the practice may have been imported from areas of the world where it is more common, including India and China “where sex-selective abortions have taken place on an industrial scale”.
A Department of Health spokesman said any abortion based on sex selection is “illegal and morally wrong”.
“UK birth ratios are within normal limits,” he said. “However, we continue to closely monitor ratios and we are in the process of analysing preliminary data. If anyone has evidence of sex-selection abortions being performed in specific cases, we will refer them to the police to investigate.”
A study by Oxford University academics has previously found evidence that suggested Indian women giving birth in Britain were terminating more female than male unborn babies between 1990 and 2005.
In Canada, Dr Rajendra Kale, the editor of a medical journal, last year called for doctors to withhold the sex of unborn babies from their mothers until 30 weeks into pregnancy to stop “female feticide”.
He cited a study suggesting “evidence of a clear son preference among south-east Asian immigrants to Canada”, with male-biased birth ratios among Chinese, Korean and Indian parents.
Last year, the Council of Europe recommended that member states, including Britain, stop telling parents the gender of their baby because of concerns that this was encouraging sex-selection abortions.
Many hospitals have stopped giving parents information on the gender of their babies until late in the pregnancy.
However, blood tests that disclose the sex of a foetus are widely available on the internet or abroad.
Abortions for non-medical reasons are legal until 24 weeks, but terminations on grounds of sex of the foetus are illegal under the 1967 Abortion Act.
In 2010 there were 189,574 terminations in England and Wales, an eight per cent increase in the past decade.

In the wake of the Ukrainian crisis in 2013–2014, renewed attention has been given to the earlier so-called “frozen conflicts” of the successor states of the Soviet Union. In Georgia, Moldova, and Azerbaijan, national conflicts of the early 1990s resulted in establishment of four breakaway regions, the de facto states of Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Transnistria, and Nagorny Karabakh. While the first three are supported by Russia, the latter is supported by Armenia. Such support as well as growing internal legitimacy has enabled these republics to retain separate status for almost 25 years. Though appearing quite similar from an external perspective, the populations of the de facto states are quite diverse in composition, geopolitical preferences, and support for political institutions and persons. Large representative public opinion surveys conducted by the authors in 2010–2011 in the four de facto states allow a deeper comprehension of internal political and social dynamics. Three main dimensions of their current status and orientation (relations with Russia, support for local institutions, and possibilities of post-war reconciliation) are examined using nine key comparative questions. Nationality is the main predictor of divergent opinions within the republics, and results are reported along this dimension. Close relations with the external patron, support for the legitimacy and identity of the respective de facto republics, and little interest in returning to the parent state testify to the longevity and successful promotion of state and nation in the de facto republics in the Caucasus-Black Sea Region.
Judge calls for submissions from those who oppose bankruptcy as he prepares to rule on whether city has proved it is insolvent
Pension funds and investors prepared to file objections to Detroit's historic bankruptcy proceedings on Monday before a crucial court hearing.
Judge Steven Rhodes, who is overseeing the proceedings, set a deadline of 11.59pm ET Monday for public employee pension funds, retirees, bondholders and others to oppose the city's plans to file for the largest ever municipal bankruptcy.
So far, only a few former city workers have filed official objections with the court despite widespread objections and legal manoeuvres to block the proceedings.
Rhodes has called for the submissions as he prepares to rule on whether the city has proven it is insolvent and negotiated in good faith with its creditors before granting the Chapter 9 bankruptcy. The filings come ahead of a trial to consider Detroit's eligibility for bankruptcy that is scheduled for October 23.
Kevyn Orr, Detroit's state-appointed emergency manager, made the decision to file for bankruptcy last month, saying the city could no longer cope with its $18bn debts. Orr stopped payment on $2.5bn in debt in June.
The decision came after negotiations between the city's pension funds, bondholders and Orr collapsed. In a court filing, Orr claimed "further negotiations with all of the city's various stakeholders is impracticable."
Orr must prove that the city negotiated in good faith with its creditors and did everything possible to reach a resolution. Bondholders dispute this. The Chapter 9 proceeding must also overcome objections from pension funds that Orr's plan violates Michigan's constitution which protects pension benefits.
If Rhodes declines to allow the bankruptcy to proceed, creditors will be allowed to sue the city for defaulting on payments. If the chapter 9 goes ahead, pensioners and city workers face deep cuts in their benefits and bondholders will see the value of their investments slashed. Some investors could receive as little as 10¢ on the dollar.
Orr, a former corporate lawyer who helped Chrysler through its bankruptcy, has said he would like city to emerge from bankruptcy by September 2014. A lengthy court battle could extend that time frame.
Since 1954 there have been just 63 Chapter 9 filings dealing with cities, towns, villages or counties across the country, and none as large as what Orr is proposing. Of those cases 29 were dismissed for reasons that included ineligibility.
James Spiotto, bankruptcy specialist at the law firm of Chapman and Cutler, said Detroit's case appeared far stronger than many of the rejected cases. In some cases alternative solutions had been found that avoided the necessity of a Chapter 9 filing. "Those options don't seem to exist here," he said.
Detroit's list of creditors filled 3,504 pages of court documents. The city's two largest unsecured creditors are its pension funds, the general retirement system and Detroit police and fire retirement system. Orr calculates that the two schemes are underfunded by $3.5bn, a figure the funds dispute.
The city's next largest creditors are its bondholders. Fears that they will have the value of their investments slashed are already impacting the ability of other Michigan cities. Three local governments postponed plans to raise money although some investors have recently started investing in Michigan-based bonds again. Investors bought $18.7m of bonds earlier this month to fund school districts in Ypsilanti, 30 miles west of Detroit.

England coach Eddie Jones says Scotland will start as favourites when the two sides meet at Murrayfield in next week's Six Nations opening round.
Scotland's World Cup performances and the fact they have a settled side give them the advantage, according to Jones.
"We've only had six training sessions together so there is an enormous pressure on Scotland to perform and not so much on us," he said.
"The bookies might have us as favourites but Scotland have to be."

Scotland have lost their last seven Six Nations games.
Their only win in their last 12 championship games was a 21-20 win over Italy in Rome in February 2014.
They have not beaten England, runners-up for the last four years, since 2008.

Scotland, coached by Vern Cotter, reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup, losing narrowly to Australia, while hosts England surprisingly bowed out in the group stages.
England's displays ultimately cost Stuart Lancaster his job and led to former Australia and Japan coach Jones taking over.

WASHINGTON--Eighteen Starbucks shops can be found in the three-mile walk from DuPont Circle to the U.S. Capitol. Not one of them had a line less than seven people deep on a recent Wednesday afternoon.
Twenty-one construction sites filled with workers on girders and cranes towering over whole city blocks can be found on the same walk.
Commerce bursts from every angle of this city: small businesses packed with shoppers, hair salons charging more than the monthly mortgage payment on my first house for a cut-and-blow-dry, and main as well as side streets clogged with traffic.
America's capital seems bubble-wrapped in its own vibrant economic boom, while great chunks of the nation struggle with uncertainty about how to keep the engine going.
In fact, six of the 10 wealthiest American counties are Washington suburbs.
Washington once was the manifest of power. Now you can add “center of wealth” to its portfolio, crystallizing the elite institutional disconnect between it and the rest of the country.
Nearly six months have passed since the last presidential campaign promises were preached. Six months of waiting outside of the bubble for the Obama administration to fulfill passionate vows inserted into soaring speeches that pledged to create a million new manufacturing jobs in this term, to help big factories and small businesses double their exports, and to invest in advanced manufacturing.
All were promises made by the president, over and over again, in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, Wisconsin and Michigan.
The outcome has not matched the promises, not even closely.
Manufacturing has stalled in the last three months, with only pockets of growth in certain sectors. A report last week by the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index showed contraction, with manufacturing job-growth hitting its plateau before Election Day last year.
And what about all of those job promises?
A Labor Department report on Friday showed marginally improved job growth but manufacturing jobs remain sluggish.
So, while Washington basks in its roaring economy, debating such issues as gay marriage, guns and how to provide a path to citizenship for 11 million illegal aliens, the rest of the country asks, “Hi, remember us? Where are the jobs? Can we focus on the jobs?”
The lack of attention given to the economy affects Main Streeters' very existence in a way that Washington does not understand. John Smith may have a job, but what about the impact in his community when his neighbors are out of work, or struggling to piece two lower-paying jobs together to make ends meet?
Such uncertainty affects spending habits as well. Consumers are behaving as though they are living paycheck to paycheck, because they don't know what is coming down the pike. That lack of spending means that tourism, travel and entertainment suffer; small shops, restaurants, hotels, grocery stores, service stations all eventually feel the pinch. Just ask anyone who owns a business in destination points across the country, and they'll tell you business is down.
Our economic recovery since 2009 has been sluggish, with few bright spots. Yet, when Americans went into the voting booths last year (if they did), they believed President Obama's rhetoric on class warfare and that he had their best interests at heart.
That has not played out six months later. A recovery is going on in this country, but most of the beneficiaries seem to be living right inside the Beltway.
And the polls back that up: Last month's Associated Press survey showed that only one in four Americans think their own financial situation will improve in the next year, and 52 percent of us disapprove of Obama's handling of the economy.
The centralized power and wealth in our nation's capital are becoming so disconnected from the rest of this country that it is palpable to everyone except those who live in Washington.
In most people's lives, the driving issue is economic security. Washington's obsession is with social and cultural issues that drive bigger wedges between Us and Them.
It's only a matter of time before the rest of America's complaints will burst Washington's bubble.
Americans have no Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures if they happen to be within 100 miles of the border, according to the “Executive Summary” of a still-secret report by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). As the ACLU-created map above shows, nearly 2/3 of Americans (197 million people)—including the entire populations of Florida, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Washington, DC, and Michigan—live in this “Constitution free” zone, as do the residents of the nation's five most populous cities: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston and Philadelphia.
The secret report is DHS's response (two years late) to critics of its policy, in place since at least 2008, of allowing border control agents, without a warrant or even a suspicion of wrongdoing, to search any travelers' electronic devices (laptops, cell phones, tablets, cameras, etc.) and seize data they find. According to Freedom of Information Act request (FOIA) filed three years ago by the ACLU, DHS subjected more than 6,500 travelers—nearly half of them U.S. citizens—to searches under this policy between October 2008 and June 2010.
The Executive Summary of the secret report, which DHS is allowing the public to see, sets forth its conclusions without even summarizing the reasoning underlying them. Thus it asserts that “imposing a requirement that officers have reasonable suspicion in order to conduct a border search of an electronic device would be operationally harmful without concomitant civil rights/civil liberties benefits,” but is silent on how DHS defines “civil rights/civil liberties benefits” or how it balances these against its institutional needs.
The ACLU, which has already filed an FOIA request demanding the full report, released a statement arguing that “allowing government agents to search through all of a traveler's data without reasonable suspicion is completely incompatible with our fundamental rights: our Fourth Amendment right to privacy—and more specifically the right to be free from unreasonable searches—is implicated when the government can rummage through our computers and cell phones for no reason other than that we happen to have traveled abroad. Suspicionless searches also open the door to profiling based on perceived or actual race, ethnicity, or religion. And our First Amendment rights to free speech and free association are inhibited when agents at the border can target us for searches based on our exercise of those rights.”

From the beginning of May until late June, stock markets worldwide declined sharply, with losses surpassing 10%. The first weeks of July brought only marginal relief. Ominous voices began to warn that the weakness of stocks was a direct response to the stalling of an economic recovery that has lasted barely a year. Anxiety over debt-laden European countries  most notably Greece  combined with stubbornly high unemployment in the U.S. to create a toxic but fertile mix that allowed concern to blossom into full-bloom fear.
The most common refrain was that stocks are weak because global economic activity is sagging. A July 12 report by investment bank Credit Suisse was titled Are the Markets Forecasting Recession? With no more stimulus spending on the horizon in the U.S., Europeans on austerity budgets and consumer sentiment best characterized as surly, the sell-off in stocks was explained as a simple response to an economy on the ropes. (See pictures of TIME's Wall Street covers.)
It's a good story and a logical one. But it distorts reality. Stocks are no longer mirrors of national economies; they are not  as is so commonly said  magical forecasting mechanisms. They are small slices of ownership in specific companies, and today, those companies have less connection to any one national economy than ever before.
As a result, stocks are not proxies for the U.S. economy, or that of the European Union or China, and markets are deeply unreliable gauges of anything but the underlying strength of the companies they represent and the schizophrenic mind-set of the traders who buy and sell the shares. There has always been a question about just how much of a forecasting mechanism markets are. Hence the saying that stocks have correctly predicted 15 of the past nine recessions. At times, stocks soar as the economy sours (in 1975, for instance) or sour when the economy soars (as with China's stock market, the Shanghai stock exchange, in the past year).
At other times, stocks have tracked or even anticipated a nation's economic strength  but that happened in an era when a strong relationship existed between the companies that traded on a particular exchange (American companies on the New York Stock Exchange, British companies in London) and the country in which they traded. For many years, American companies did most of their business in the U.S., so their results could be expected to parallel the larger economy.
But since the turn of the millennium, business and capital have gone truly global. The companies of the S&P 500 now make about half of their sales outside the U.S., and if you remove geography-bound utilities and railroads, regional banks and a fair number of retailers, the percentage is higher. Tech and industrial firms such as 3M, Hewlett-Packard and Intel derive two-thirds or more of their sales beyond the U.S. That means that even if the U.S. economy is a total wash, they can access other markets to maintain their growth. The same might be said of a German conglomerate like Siemens, a Dutch powerhouse like Philips or a Korean company like Samsung. (See pictures of the global financial crisis.)
This is known within companies, though CEOs are often susceptible to the false story  which makes some sense, given that most CEOs are older than 50 and once operated in a world where what was good for GM was indeed good for America. But look at the actual balance sheets of thousands of global companies, large and small, and you'll find that their fortunes have diverged from those of their national economies.
Over the past two years, as unemployment in the U.S. has soared and GDP has stumbled, companies have been minting money. Tons of it. The Shaw Group, an engineering firm that makes things like nuclear power plants in Saudi Arabia, trades at about $32 a share and has $19 per share in cash. It would be as if you owned outright a $500,000 home and had $300,000 in the bank. That is the case for most companies. Their position is almost the opposite of governments' and consumers': lots of growth, little debt and mounds of money.
They have amassed that hoard of cash, and are now growing on average 20% a year, at a time when the economies of Europe, the U.S. and Japan are flat. But you'd never know that from the continued drumbeat about how markets reflect economies. Every time Apple unveils a new product and millions rush to buy it, we should pause for a moment and wonder which jobs report  the one released by the U.S. government every month or the Steve Jobs report on Apple's health  tells us more about the world.
As companies report their earnings for the second quarter of 2010, it will be harder than ever to escape the fact that corporations now inhabit their own thriving economy, unencumbered by many of the ills of nation-states. That may be exhilarating (if you're an investor) or troubling (if you're a citizen), but either way, it's time to let go of the false belief that as goes the economy, so go companies and their stocks.

Melbourne, Florida (CNN) Donald Trump declared himself the unquestionable winner of his first debate against Hillary Clinton during a rally Tuesday night, then relived the entire debate before a Florida crowd of supporters, this time with the help of a teleprompter -- and without Clinton baiting him.
The Republican presidential nominee ticked down a list of issues he failed to sufficiently hammer Clinton on during their 90-minute bout -- from her foreign policy failures to her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. He also insisted on defending two factually incorrect statements he made the previous night.
Trump touted unscientific, online post-debate polls as "things of beauty."
He also again claimed to be "holding back" during the faceoff because he "didn't want to do anything to embarrass" Clinton. That comment came after blaming debate moderator Lester Holt of NBC News for being tough on him earlier in the day,
"For 90 minutes I watched her very carefully and I was also holding back. I didn't want to do anything that embarrassed her," Trump said Tuesday. "For 90 minutes, she argued against change, while I called for dramatic change. We have to have dramatic change."

A MAN is recovering after surviving nearly three days stuck in his pickup truck in an Alaskan snowdrift by eating frozen cans of light beer.
Clifton Vial was unable to dig out his Toyota Tacoma after it plunged into the snowdrift some 70km north of the town of Nome, in western Alaska, last night, the Anchorage Daily News reported.
He had no food and no water - and was out of cell phone coverage.
"I felt really pissed at myself," Vial said. "I shouldn't have been out there by myself unprepared for what I knew was possible."
After getting into a sleeping bag and wrapping a bath towel around his feet, he could only occasionally start the truck to run the heater - and wait for rescuers to arrive.
The operator mechanic's employer reported him missing to police Wednesday and it wasn't until Thursday afternoon that authorities managed to locate the vehicle.
Vial said he found the freezing temperatures worse than the hunger during his 60-hour ordeal but got desperate enough to "eat" a few cans of Coors Light that had frozen solid.
"I cut the lids off and dug it out with a knife," he said.
The 52-year-old said he had no visible signs of frostbite but had lost about 7kg.
Cathy Samford used to be a science teacher at Heritage Christian Academy in Rockwall, Texas. But no longer. The Christian school fired Samford upon learning that she had become pregnant by her fiancé. That's right. A Christian school in Texas fired a teacher for getting pregnant without being married first.
It's an action that has ‘wrongful termination lawsuit' written all over it. And Samford certainly intends to take the school to court and may even sue.
“I'm not just some teacher that went out to a bar and got pregnant and went back to school saying it's okay,” Samford said. “I was in a committed relationship the whole time and probably would have been married if things had gone differently and this would be a non-situation. I didn't think I would lose my job. I was in shock and devastated and that's when I said, ‘If this is the problem, I'm willing, and so is my fiancé, to go ahead and get married.' That wasn't the issue. We were going to get married regardless. I'm very worried about money. I'm just hoping to make it through this month. I've had lots of medical bills. My insurance was dropped so everything I've had to pay is out of pocket. I'm using my tax return just to live on. It's a big concern. I don't know what next month holds for me.”
?So Samford offered to get married as a way to satisfy the school, but that didn't change their mind. They still fired her. Remember when conservative Christians like Rick Santorum claimed that pregnancy was a gift from God that should be cherished? This Christian school apparently doesn't feel the same way. Instead of treating Samford as a Christian woman who committed to a loving relationship and chose to have a baby, they treated her like an outcast. The school's headmaster, Dr. Ron Taylor, says that Samford was fired for practicing values that are un-Christian and that even if she got married, it wouldn't change a thing.
“It doesn't change that her behavior was out of wedlock. It's not that she's pregnant. The issue here is being an unmarried mother. Everything that we stand for says that we want our teachers, who we consider to be in the ministry, to model what a Christian man or woman should be.”
Here's the video via ABC:
video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player
So in Taylor's warped mind, a model Christian is one who openly discriminates against a woman for getting pregnant with the man she's going to marry and choosing to keep the baby. And apparently, a model Christian is one who fires a pregnant woman and denies her insurance coverage that would take care of not only the mother, but the needs of the child she is carrying. But that's not all. Samford also has two other children from a previous marriage to take care of. By firing Samford, the school is punishing her children as well.
Taylor insists that because the school is private, they can fire her and hide behind religion to skirt anti-discrimination laws designed to protect women and women who are pregnant from being terminated because of gender and condition. He, like many evangelical Christians, is wrong. Being a private institution doesn't give the school the right to ignore federal law. Federal law applies to everyone. There are no special privileges for religious people. If that were the case, any Christian employer could break the law and hide behind their Bible. America doesn't work that way. Everyone is equal under the law. Being a Christian doesn't entitle you to immunity from federal law. But that's what Dr. Ron Taylor, supposed “Christian,” thinks.
This is yet another shot being fired in the Republican war on women. As you may already know, Republicans are pushing laws that would allow ANY employer to question what women do in their private sex lives. Because conservative Christians feel they should be allowed to discriminate against and even FIRE women who engage in what they consider un-Christian values, Republicans are trying to give employers the power to regulate what women do with their reproductive health. That is exactly what this “Christian” school did in this case. They object to the timing of Samford's pregnancy, so they fired her, effectively sending a message to female employees that if they make reproductive decisions not condoned by the mostly male senior level administrators, they will be fired. The top two administrators at the school are both men. Coincidence? You be judged. Here's the school's website, which just so happens to have contact info as well.
The's and Oakland Raiders reached a two-year agreement to remain at the O.co Coliseum. (Photo11: Thearon W. Henderson, Getty Images) Story Highlights The's reached a two-year agreement to remain at the O.co Coliseum
The's have their sights set on relocating to San Jose
Any games the Oakland Athletics play at AT&T Park next season will continue to be as the visiting team.
The's and Oakland Raiders reached a Monday on short lease extensions at the O.co Coliseum, preventing the possibility of the A's moving to San Francisco for the 2014 season. That option had been floated as leverage, with the backing of Major League Baseball, during the club's negotiations with the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority, which manages the facility.
The's lease is through the 2015 season. The club has their sights set on relocating to a new ballpark that would be built in San Jose, but the San Francisco Giants have territorial rights to the area and have opposed the move. A committee appointed by Commissioner Bud Selig more than 4½ years ago has studied the A's ballpark options but has yet to issue a report.
The Raiders, who returned to Oakland in 1995 after a 13-year stint in Los Angeles, are also seeking a new facility, preferably in the Coliseum's current location. Their new deal only extends through the next NFL season.
The Joint Powers Authority said in a statement that it will continue discussing future leases and stadium projects on the site with the clubs.
One possibility is turning the Coliseum complex – which includes Oracle Arena, home of the Golden State Warriors – into a sports and entertainment hub, a project dubbed Coliseum City.
"There are numerous paths forward, and one may be the Coliseum City project, to retain these teams as part of our local economy,'' said Alameda County Supervisor Nate Miley, chairman of the authority's board. "We will use these lease terms to continue to work on a long-term solution that works for all parties.''
While the A's lease calls for a yearly fee of $1.75 million, more than four times the $400,000 the Raiders pay, the San Francisco Chronicle reports the team will now have control of concession revenues and the right to choose the vendor. The issue had been a source of contention during lease negotiations.
The JPA initially pursued a longer deal, while the A's wanted to keep it to five years or less.
"I am prepared to do either two or five years,'' A's co-owner Lew Wolff told the Chronicle. "The JPA preferred two years. We can discuss a longer term later.''
Rep. Dennis Kucinich hasn't said whether he will run for president in 2012, but the liberal Ohio Democrat seems to be acting like a candidate with his recent crusade against President Barack Obama on Libya.
Today, Kucinich will take to the House floor to offer his rebuttal to Obama's Monday night speech outlining reasons for international attacks on Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi's military. Kucinich has long been an anti-war advocate, but this time, he's challenging the policies of a president from his own party.
“I am making a principled challenge to the actions of the administration, and I can't tell you that I'm doing it with any enthusiasm because it's not easy to challenge individuals who you otherwise have an affection for,” Kucinich said in an interview this week. “This goes beyond friendship, it goes beyond party; it goes to principles involved in finding this nation.”
Kucinich, who twice ran for the presidency on an anti-war platform, said he “hasn't really been thinking about” waging a primary challenge to Obama in 2012. But he nevertheless said the president violated the Constitution by committing U.S. troops to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya without first getting Congress' approval. And he has vowed to push an amendment into the next continuing resolution to block funding for the effort.
Democratic aides note that Kucinich's anti-war rhetoric is nothing new, and they say most Members are relatively unfazed by his latest offensive on Libya. But Kucinich has been attracting the attention of media outlets and has found some uncommon Republican bedfellows in the process.
“I don't know if he's a renewed leader as much as the subject he's most vocal about is again in the news,” one House Democratic aide said.
Even Kucinich admits that a moment has met opportunity when it comes to challenging Obama's position on Libya.
“When a platform presents itself ... I've not hesitated to speak out on these issues,” Kucinich said. “I was active in challenging what I felt was an abuse of war powers by the Clinton administration, the Bush administration. It's not as though I've taken a partisan approach to this.”
Kucinich sought the presidency in 2004 and again in 2008, largely because of his opposition to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Kucinich attempted to bring articles of impeachment against then-Vice President Dick Cheney in 2007 and later against President George W. Bush in 2008, primarily over the war in Iraq. And for years, Kucinich has advocated for the establishment of a Department of Peace.
On Libya, Kucinich has teamed up with Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas), who ran for the White House in 2008, and Rep. Walter Jones Jr. (R-N.C.) on the amendment to CR. The alliance is a familiar one for Kucinich, who worked with Jones earlier this month on a resolution calling for a withdrawal of troops in Afghanistan. That resolution won 93 votes.
So far Democratic leaders have not tried to quiet Kucinich's stance on Libya, even as it opens Obama up to criticism from within his own ranks. In fact, House Democratic Caucus Chairman John Larson (Conn.), who like Kucinich said that Congress should have been called back from recess last week to consider a declaration of war, credited his colleague for his outspoken position on the issue.
“I think Dennis is not only a voice in the Caucus, he's a national voice,” Larson said. “It's not that all of the members of our Caucus will agree with his position, and he may take a harder, more edgy point of view. But even if they don't support him, they'll nod their heads and say he had the nerve to say something that was difficult.”
Asked this week whether he thought Kucinich might run for president in 2012, Ohio Republican Rep. Steven LaTourette said: “Never say never.”
Kucinich said he plans to challenge Democratic leaders for deciding to back Obama on Libya before rank-and-file Members had been consulted. And while Kucinich demurred on whether he will make a third White House bid next year, he said he did plan seek a ninth term to the House in 2012. Ohio will lose two seats in redistricting next year and Kucinich's Cleveland-based district stands to be vastly changed or even done away with. Accustomed to fighting uphill battles, the former Cleveland mayor said he would press on.
Kucinich ended up dropping out of the presidential primary contest in January 2008 in part because he was facing a primary challenge for his House seat.
“It's already been widely established that my district will either be altered or abolished, but that's a year and a half from now,” Kucinich said of redistricting. “Sometimes you have to take a stand without regard to what the political consequences are going to be. I'm not seeking to curry favor with what I'm doing. If you don't take a stand, what are you here for? This isn't ‘Dancing with the Stars.'”
Led by biomedical engineer Justin Zook of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a team of scientists from Harvard University and the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute of Virginia Tech has presented new methods to integrate data from different sequencing platforms, thus producing a reliable set of genotypes to serve as a benchmark for human genome sequencing.
“Understanding the human genome is an immensely complex task and we need great methods to guide this research,” Zook says. “By establishing reference materials and gold standard data sets, scientists are one step closer to bringing genome sequencing into clinical practice.”
The methods put forth by the researchers make it increasingly possible to use an individual's genetic profile to guide medical decisions to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases — a priority of the National Institutes of Health. Their work was published in the Feb. 16 issue of Nature Biotechnology.
“We minimize biases toward any sequencing platform or data set by comparing and integrating 11 whole human genomes and three exome data sets from five sequencing platforms,” says Zook.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology organized the Genome in a Bottle Consortium to make well-characterized, whole-genome reference materials available to research, commercial, and clinical laboratories.
The team addressed the challenge with the expertise of David Mittelman, an associate professor of biological sciences at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute, who creates tools that analyze vast amounts of genomic information.
The researchers created a metric to determine the accuracy of gene variations and understand biases and sources of error in sequencing and bioinformatics methods.
Their findings are available to the public on the Genome Comparison and Analytic Testing website, known as GCAT, to enable real-time benchmarking of any DNA-sequencing method. The collaborative, free online resource compares multiple analysis tools across a variety of crowd-sourced metrics and data sets.
GCAT was built with the help of Virginia Tech Intellectual Properties and a faculty-owned, start-up company called Arpeggi, which Mittelman cofounded. Arpeggi has since been acquired by Gene Ltd, a company that offers clinical and direct-to-consumer genetic testing. Mittelman is a partner and equity holder in Gene by Gene Ltd.
The Family Friendly Programming Forum is a coalition of over 40 advertisers, all of whom belong to the Association of National Advertisers. They seek to increase the amount of "family-friendly" programming on U.S. television.
They define family-friendly programming as:
It is relevant to today's TV viewer, has generational appeal, depicts real life and is appropriate in theme, content and language for a broad family audience. Family friendly programs also embody a responsible resolution. Family friendly programs may include movies, dramas, situation comedies and informational programs.[1]
The FFPF supports various programs and initiatives:

Beware the first semester
When I ask my students about their biggest college regret, it is almost universally, "my first semester."
Graduates often lament that they spent their entire college career trying to recover from the damage inflicted to their GPA in the first semester.
The change in class structure and freedom catches students off guard.
Professors don't coddle like high school teachers.
Most won't even force students to attend class.
For students in dorms, parents can't act like a check on bad habits.
Students without a strong sense of discipline find themselves sleeping through 8 AM classes, failing to study for exams and unable to complete assignments.
Most of these students sober up and gain discipline when they see their grades for the first semester, and live with a sense of regret thereafter.
Those that don't drop out at the end of freshman year.
Here are some tips specific to the first semester:
Don't get a TV. It's too easy to sit in a dorm room and watch TV, or to leave it on in the background, distracting you while studying. Once you've confirmed (or established) your discipline, you can handle a TV.
Don't play any games. If you're a gamer, try giving it up (or restricting it to weekends) for just the first semester. It's not necessarily common, but I've known students that failed out from spending too much time on games. World of Warcraft is the usual culprit these days.
Don't party too much. College is going to take 4-5 years. There is plenty of time for parties later. For socializing in your freshman year, consider joining mutual interest clubs.
Professors are not teachers
Teachers in high school were trained and certified to educate.
Professors spent the best years of their lives extending the boundary of human knowledge, and then won a professorship on their prowess in research.
After that, someone threw them into a classroom and asked them to teach.
But, they're also trying to conduct research, publish papers, write grant proposals, advise students, perform service and manage a lab.
Teaching is rarely, if ever, the top concern for a professor.
To the extent that professors teach well, it's because the subject matter is aligned with their academic interests, and that tends to generate passion and enthusiasm in the classroom.
When professors teach out of their specialty, some regard it as a chore whose effort is to be minimized--to the detriment of students. [To be fair, there are many professors that rise to the challenge and seek excellence in teaching.]
The key to interacting with professors is to realize that they're not teachers.
As researchers, professors have access to the cutting edge.
Few students exploit that access, but it's not hard:
Ask professors about their research. Even the crankiest professor is going to brighten when talking about their own research. If it sounds interesting, ask if they need help in their lab. Professors in fields like science and engineering may even be able to pay you!
Go to office hours. Few students take advantage of office hours. It's a chance to get one-on-one mentoring from an expert. Plus, when you ask for a letter of recommendation, the professor will know you. Professors use office hours to measure the quality of their lecture material. If several students come by with the same confusion, it's a signal to clear up that material.
Sit in the front row. A good professor is going to tune the lecture by reading the facial expressions of students. Unfortunately, it's hard to see all the way in the back, so we're really crafting the lecture to those that sit up front, whose faces we can see.
Get ahead
College classes cover material much faster than high school classes.
When students slip behind in understanding, they get battered.
I've seen panic turn to depression and then incapacitation in weeks.
The best defense against falling behind is to start off ahead.
When possible, buy textbooks in advance, and work through the first couple chapters for each before the semester begins.
Look at web sites and syllabi for the last offering of the course to see which material is relevant.
Try to stay two weeks ahead of the course throughout the semester.
Eat into the cushion for a class when pressure spikes in another class.
If you find yourself slipping behind, it's critical to contact your professor as soon as possible.
If you're a week or two behind on the material, you can probably catch up in office hours very quickly.
Fight procrastination
Procrastination slays GPAs of bright students.
Modern life floods us with avenues for procrastination.
Coupled with the high degree of freedom afforded to students to craft their own schedule, students may find themselves in a procrastinative rut several times throughout their college career.
[If you find yourself unable to break out of a rut, you may be depressed, and you should go to the student counseling service on campus.]
The best defense against procrastination is to acknowledge it and install safeguards to prevent it.
Mold your environment so that the path of the least resistance is the path of maximum productivity:
If you're prone to wasting time online, block your time-wasting sites with tools like LeechBlock, WasteNoTime and StayFocusd.
Cripple your technology.
Go to the library to study or work. (If you need a little more ambient activity, try a coffee shop.)
Ditch TV.
Never study in bed.
For computer science majors, I advocate spending your first semester entirely under linux.
In particular, spend as much time as possible at the console, the most distraction-free environment that you will ever find.
Learn to do as much as you can without a GUI, and you will reap the productivity benefits for years.
Pay attention
Pay attention in lecture.
Don't have your phone, laptop or tablet out where it can distract you.
If you want to take notes on your laptop, disable wi-fi.
Watch your health
It's easy to neglect both physical and mental health in college.
An irregular diet of ramen, pizza, coffee and beer for four years is not ideal.
All-nighters and late nights take their toll.
Cloistering oneself for days on end with little fresh air and activity steadily chips away at well-being.
The brain is an organ: a healthy body supports a healthy mind.
To stay balanced, eat well, sleep well and exercise in moderation.
Sleep
If you find yourself consistently staying up late, set an alarm for when to go to bed.
I had a friend in grad school that took this to the extreme: she ditched her alarm clock entirely, which forced her to be in bed early enough to wake up on time.
Eat
At some point, every college student hits a phase where they subsist mostly on coffee, ramen and free pizza.
Don't stay in that phase for long.
Many college students also find themselves packing on weight for the first time in their lives.
If you find yourself gaining weight, survey your caloric input and expenditure for a week.
If necessary, adjust to lose weight.
Exercise
Exercise is a stimulant for the creative thinking critical to success in college.
By exercise, I refer to anything other than sedentary inactivity.
Moreover, the years between 18 and 22 are a prime time to exercise.
Your body will never produce the same results for so little effort ever again.
Your high metabolism makes it easy to manipulate your weight.
Your elevated hormones allow you to build muscle and cut fat with ease.
Your ability to rapidly (and fully) recover from minor injury allows you to exercise with an intensity that will not be possible even a decade later.
The (usually free) gym on campus gives you access to lots of equipment, but you can also make your dorm room into a mini-gym for day-round intermittent exercise:
Install a pull-up bar in your dorm room door: or, get a removable bar : Do a pull-up each time you enter or leave.
in your dorm room door: or, get a removable bar : Do a pull-up each time you enter or leave. Keep a set of compact, adjustable dummbells next to your desk:
next to your desk: Keep a pair of comfortable running shoes by the door. [You will be surprised by how many building on campus have showers. Bring a change of clothes and try jogging to class a couple days a week!]
Save time; save money
The pricing structure for credit hours is not linear.
At the University of Utah, where I teach, taking one class (3 credit hours) would cost an in-state freshman $1,377.
But, that same freshman would pay only $694 per class if they took seven classes in a semester!
When I was an undergrad, the price for more than 12 credit hours in a semester was exactly the same as 12 credit hours: every class I took past 12 credit hours had no additional cost.
By taking the maximum allowable 21 credit hours (about 7 classes) per semester, each semester, I cut my total tuition bill by 42%!
Your university almost certainly has a similar non-linear pricing structure.
Warning: A reader wrote to warn against attempting this approach until one has sufficiently adapted to the rigors of collegiate instruction. Attempting to take a heavy courseload before one is adequately prepared may lead to burnout, and should be attempted only with caution. It is certainly not advised to take this approach in the first semester.
Get residency
Most state schools also have steep discounts for residents, and every state has a set of guidelines for establishing residency.
Some states, like Utah, make it easy for non-resident students to establish residency during their freshman year.
(Some states make it almost impossible to gain residency as a student.)
Check the requirements for your school: residency may be easier than you think.
Go TuThu (or MWF)
If possible, schedule all of your classes for Tuesday-Thursday.
(Failing that, aim for all Monday-Wednesday-Friday classes.)
A schedule that concentrates all classes on a few days makes it possible to devote entire days to either lecture or to study/work.
Eliminating context-switching between these modes improves efficiency.
(And, a four-day break between classes every week lets you refresh.)
Register early
Precious slots in some courses fill up quickly.
Get access to priority registration if at all possible.
Some schools offer early registration as a perk for participating in certain programs on campus, or for having "honors" standing.
If you're an incoming freshman, you may be able to register using your student ID and password during other summer orientation sessions: try to register online during the first orientation session.
Regardless of priority, register for classes on the earliest possible date.
If a class you want is full, check for drops weekly until the first week. In the first week itself, check several times each day. Most classes will churn 5-10% of their enrollment in the first week, and you can usually sneak in.
Take courses from the best teachers
Don't take your major classes from the "easy" professors.
Take your major classes from the good professors.
Professor rating sites may grant a relative sense of quality between two professors. They are not necessarily indicators of absolute quality.
Ask around among fellow students to figure out the best professors to take.
Avoid professors that are difficult out of cruelty.
If a professor teaches a difficult course as a byproduct of a sincere desire to impart deep knowledge, take that class!
Don't pay full price for textbooks
Textbook pricing is morally bankrupt.
Never pay full price for a textbook.
Check online for cheap prices on used textbooks.
Sometimes, a professor orders a textbook for only a couple of its chapters.
In this case, borrowing the book from the school library is the best option.
If you become a teaching assistant, you will probably gain access to a TA library, which will have several copies of every textbook used within the department.
Don't take courses you don't have to
If you acquired a significant body of knowledge in a subject in high school but couldn't get credit for it at your university, check on the policies for challenge by exam.
Some departments have a policy of granting credit (or a prerequisite waiver) if you can pass the final exam of a class.
For popular introductory courses, there are often prescheduled sessions for attempting these exams before the start of the semester.
Get a surplus computer
Many universities have a "surplus and salvage" department.
For less than $100, you can walk out with 3-4 year-old desktop computer that was once "high-end," yet missing only a hard drive.
Because clockspeeds haven't increased recently, the computer will likely have comparable sequential performance to a high-end machine.
Stay safe
Most colleges have a campus police number to call to request an escort.
Label the emergency, dispatch and escort numbers (if different) in your phone, and keep them in favorites/speed dial.
If you're out on campus late, don't even hesitate to call for an escort back to your room.
Technical majors: Learn LaTeX
LaTeX is a free, commonly used program for writing technical documents in mathematics, engineering and science.
(There's a good chance some of your textbooks are written in LaTeX too.)
LaTeX allows you to quickly create elegantly rendered technical documents with equations like this:
LaTeX documents render directly to PDF (among other formats).
LaTeX documents have crisp, distinctive feel.
Your professors will recognize it.
As a bonus, LaTeX will automatically generate your bibliography in any required format.
Make excellent dorm room coffee
You can make excellent dorm room coffee (quickly).
To do this, you'll want an AeroPress :
And, a quick-boiling electric kettle with temperature control :
I use a brewing techinque adapted from The 4-Hour Chef :
Tim Ferriss illustrates the peculiar (but excellent) technique here:
To make the perfect cup of coffee, adjust the following variables to taste:
Bean type;
Grind size;
Water temperature;
Stirring time; and
Pressing time.
Confront your weaknesses
The material you learn in class matters.
The character you develop outside of class matters a lot more.
College is a chance to systematically confront your personal weaknesses in the safety of a four-year sandbox.
When you start college, make a list of the axes along which you want to see personal growth over the next four years.
Find the environments that foster that growth.
Join the organizations that support it.
Make the friends that reflect it.

1 Get your materials. Most can be found in craft stores, except for the main part: tubular crin. These are the stretchy tubes that work like finger traps. They can be found online. Most can be found in craft stores, except for the main part: tubular crin. These are the stretchy tubes that work like finger traps. They can be found online. I Kick Shins is a great place to buy them. There are many kinds to choose from: metallic, UV reactive, mini, full size, etc. You will need about 10 yards (9.1 m). You will also need scissors, elastic, a needle, and thread. Ribbons, rexlace, craft foam are optional.
2 Cut your crin. Be careful as they stretch easily and you'll end up with something much shorter than you wanted, so try not to pull too hard. Cut them in half first, then divide them depending on how long and full you want them. Remember to keep them twice as long as you want your falls.
3 Seal the ends to prevent fraying. The simplest and best looking way involves folding the end inside itself.
4 Cut the elastic into two pieces, long enough to be tied around your hair in a bun. Also, thread your needle at this point to make it easier later. Another way you can do it is fold the cut crin in half (to the length you want). Then do the same to a second one. Then make an X with the two pieces at the middle and tied them together. Then tie it around a hair elastic. Then just keep on doing it. This one may be an easier method. Also, thread your needle at this point to make it easier later.
5 Take several pieces of crin and pinch them in the middle, laying them on top of each other. The more you use in a single section makes them more full, but you will need more sections for better coverage.
6 Take your needle and sew the crin to the elastic. Make sure you go through all the crin, then over them. Repeat until you used half your crin.
7 Do this again with the remaining half.
8 Accent your falls, if you would like. For foam, cut it in strips, and punch a hole in one end. Eyelets keep them from tearing. Paint or draw on them, put stickers on them, punch out shapes, do whatever you like. Attach them with yarn through the eyelets.

Police have decided not to issue traffic tickets to a 92-year-old Horicon man whose mishap in a parking lot ended with 10 dinged vehicles but no one hurt.
The incident occurred Friday afternoon at Mountain's Piggly Wiggly in Mayville, a small city in Dodge County about 50 miles northwest of Milwaukee.
The man apparently panicked while trying to back a 2007 Chrysler Pacifica out of a parking space and his car began striking other vehicles, some of which struck others, in turn.
WISN-TV in Milwaukee reported the decision not to issue tickets.
Debt
Thomas Jefferson bore the burden of substantial monetary debt throughout his life. Except for a brief period at the beginning of the nineteenth century,[1] it was not possible to declare bankruptcy and it was his reputation in large part that kept creditors at bay. While debt was not unusual for Virginia planters of his time, his eventually grew so ponderous that his family were forced to sell much of his property, including Monticello, after Jefferson's death. His grandson and executor of his estate, Thomas Jefferson Randolph, posted an advertisement for his estate sale, indicating that Jefferson's debts at his death amounted to $107,000. Converting this figure into a modern estimate is an inexact process at best, but it would probably be somewhere between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000.
Many factors contributed to Jefferson's indebtedness, many of them beyond his control. These are only a few reasons behind the accumulation of his debt:
Jefferson inherited a great deal of debt from his father-in-law, John Wayles, when Wayles died in 1774. Although Jefferson was wealthy in land and slaves, farming proved to be an unreliable and inadequate source of income. Also, although Jefferson himself was a major creditor, payments owed to him were unreliable and inadequate as well. Jefferson lived perpetually beyond his means, spending large amounts of money on building projects, furnishings, wine, etc. The financial panic that occurred in 1819 added a substantial burden onto his already-substantial debt. Also, he acquired debt from a friend in particular late in life. In 1818, Jefferson endorsed a $20,000 note for Wilson Cary Nicholas. Nicholas died in 1820, and Jefferson was forced to take on his unpaid debt.
Footnotes
↑ The United States Congress did pass a bankruptcy law in 1800 because of "unsettled economic conditions from widespread speculation in new companies dealing in land and in government scrip." However, it was repealed in 1803 after a return to prosperity and generally low public approval. (Concise Dictionary of American History. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1983.)

Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman delivered his second State of the City Address on Thursday, reaffirming his support to demolish the Public Safety Building and Civic Parkade.
Speaking at the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce luncheon at the RBC Convention Centre, Bowman said future development on Princess Street should be on land currently occupied by the two 1960s-era structures.
The Civic Centre Parkade has sat vacant since 2012 when it was deemed unsafe due to structural concerns. The Winnipeg police will soon completely move out of the PSB to their new headquarters on Smith Street.
“Last year, I painted a vision of what Winnipeg could be in 2045,” Bowman said. “Today, we are taking the actions and steps necessary to put us even more on track toward the Winnipeg we want in the future, and the vision I presented a year ago.”
Bowman also reiterated support for tearing down the concrete barriers at Portage and Main and opening up the intersection to pedestrian traffic. Proponents of the plan highlighted Wednesday's announcement of True North Square as another reason the barricades should come down, highlighting the need for more public accessibility and pedestrian friendly corridors in the city's downtown.
Partial proceeds from Thursday's event will be donated to the Firefighters Burn Fund.

Hi Folks! Just got two articles on school-wide bans and the coincidence compelled me to share them. Here's a piece about a middle school in New Jersey banning hugs, because some “unsuitable” ones had been witnessed and, said the superintendent, the schools must teach “appropriate” behavior.( Of course, the school isn't doing that at all, since it seems to be damning appropriate hugs right along with the “unsuitable” ones.) Here's another piece on the story.
And then there' this piece from England about the small trend of schools banning best friends, so kids don't get hurt if-or-when they get dumped. The comments are really wonderful there, including this one:
So, is the government also encouraging Polygamy? Because if you live in a group marriage then you won't feel as hurt when one of your spice dumps you??
I not only love the logic, I love the idea of calling spouses spice! Appropriate hugs to you all — L.

Every detail of this story is amazing. Thank you, James Bagarozzo.
The middle-aged Buffalo parking meter mechanic was just sentenced to 30 months in prison for swiping what amounted to 10,000 pounds worth of quarters out of city meters over a period of eight years. Here is how the FBI tells the story (bold emphasis theirs):
James Bagarozzo, who had been employed by the city for more than three decades, became a parking meter mechanic in 2003—but instead of repairing the meters, he and an accomplice rigged more than 75 of them so he could steal quarters. Over time, his small-change crime added up.
Old-school mechanical parking meters actually aren't that easy for city employees to raid. The people who repair these things don't normally have access to the coin canisters. But Bagarozzo and an accomplice tampered with a fraction of the city's 1,200 older meters so that the coins never dropped into the canisters and they could collect the loot themselves.
Bagarozzo then brought the quarters home, rolled them, and eventually took them to a local bank under the guise of a guy connected to a vending machine business. The local bank tellers never had a clue. When Bagarozzo was finally caught in December of 2011, he had more than $40,000 in cash and coins hiding in his home, much of it stashed in his bedroom ceiling.

MY LATEST VIDEOS MY LATEST VIDEOS
Cutout cookies, gingerbread cookies, no-bakes, peanut butter balls, candy-ish cookies…ugh, I love them all. And when they're all warm from the oven – that's the best! A little hot cocoa, some cookies, the tree all lit up – it's just perfect.
Clearly I will need to exercise some self-control though. As a food blogger, there tends to be an overload of sweets in my house during December. Thankfully we have some nice neighbors and my vegan brother and sister-in-law who are more than happy to take them off our hands. :)
I thought I'd do a big roundup of some super scrumptious vegan Christmas cookie recipes to help you get into the Christmas spirit!

The School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) student union at the University of London is demanding that philosophers Plato, Descartes, and Kant should be — mostly — supplanted by those from Asia and Africa.
According to The Independent, part of the union's new year priorities is to “address the structural and epistemological legacy of colonialism within our university.”
“If white philosophers were required,” one of the union's goals reads, “their work should be taught from a ‘critical standpoint', to acknowledge the colonial context in which many of their works were written.”
The group Black British Academics' Deborah Gabriel said “Teaching is often based on very narrow criteria and often tends to be eurocentric. These students are calling on scholars to meet the criteria of their role to teach from different cultural contexts, it's something we all should be doing more of.”
From the article:
However, [Gabriel] also said decolonising doesn't necessarily equate to removing the problematic. “I don't believe that necessitates removing white scholars because not all white scholars espouse ideas that are narrow in context, a lot of them do engage in anti-racist teaching. Academia often draws on series that are decades old, which is what people often find problematic,” she said. “If you remove that kind of content from the curriculum, how are you going to critique it? That is what changes attitudes and thinking by looking at past theories and how they have evolved, and looking at what is considered progressive and acceptable now.” The SOAS “educational priorities” came amid growing calls from students across the UK to rid British universities of associations with colonialism.
The Daily Mail notes the student responsible for the “Decolonising SOAS” statement in the union's Educational Priorities, Ali Habib, is an admirer of Marxist philosopher Frantz Fanon, author of the “seminal work of revolutionary anti-colonialism” The Wretched Of The Earth.
On Friday, philosopher Sir Roger Scruton responded to the union's demands saying “This suggests ignorance and a determination not to overcome that ignorance. You can't rule out a whole area of intellectual endeavour without having investigated it and clearly they haven't investigated what they mean by white philosophy.”
Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of Buckingham University added ‘There is a real danger political correctness is getting out of control. We need to understand the world as it was and not to rewrite history as some might like it to have been.”
The SOAS is Europe's largest institution dedicated to African, Asian, and Middle East studies.

Dell U2713HM Design, OSD, and Specs
The U2713HM is an LED-backlit display that offers the sRGB colorspace and a resolution of 2560x1440. It uses an IPS panel that is 8-bit, but unlike the U2711 doesn't support AFRC for simulated 10-bit color. Like all Dell monitors I have seen so far, it has a base that supports height, tilt, pivot, and swivel adjustments. Installation is a snap with Dell's standard mounting system where you just slip the monitor onto the stand and it clicks into place. The front is nice and clean, lacking any stickers or text aside from the Dell logo, and all the OSD controls are handled by a set of unlabeled buttons on the right-hand side.
I have to complement Dell on the packaging for this monitor as well. Totally forgoing Styrofoam and only using a simple cardboard design, similar to recent Sony Blu-ray players, it both keeps the display safe and doesn't fall apart, making it easy to reuse the packaging later. If you aren't keeping the packaging, it also makes recycling the included materials much easier. I appreciate both the eco-friendliness and the ease of removing the monitor from the box. Dell thankfully puts a page detailing the monitor setup at the very top of the box, something other vendors would be wise to start doing.
Dell's U2713HM also offers 2x USB 3.0 ports on the side, and two more on panel with the video connections. The panel offers DisplayPort 1.2, VGA, DVI, and HDMI inputs, as well as a connection for Dell's soundbar speaker. The PSU is integrated into the display so there is a standard 3-prong IEC socket rounding out the connections. Nothing on the U2713HM is flashy or groundbreaking; it's just very utilitarian. It's not going to stand out in a way that makes you remember it at first glance, but after using so many other displays I also find there isn't anything poorly designed that stands out either. Overall the design of the Dell U2713HM is clean and well done.
I have always given Dell high marks for their OSD and I will continue to do so here. With four buttons to control it, none of which are labeled, you would think it might be tricky but it is not. With clear on-screen labels and descriptions of the controls, as well as avoiding the common mistake of having keys labeled with arrows control menus that move the other direction, Dell does a good job here of making it easy to navigate and control. The menu options are clear, with your standard preset modes, brightness and contrast, input selection, and more display settings. One missing item is an option for an overdrive or gaming mode to improve pixel response, though in practice we haven't seen major improvements from such modes on other displays. Another missing feature is the ability to automatically select an input, which makes using it with multiple devices a little harder. The OSD remains essentially unchanged from previous Dell displays, but they have no reason to go back and reinvent it either.
Viewing angles are good for an IPS as we expect them to be. There is a light coating of anti-glare, but nothing that I find to be objectionable or that caused issues with the image for me. Unless you're trying to look at the U2713HM from a 170-degree angle or so, you shouldn't have any issues viewing it and seeing color or contrast shifts in normal use.
Dell U2713HM Video Inputs DisplayPort 1.2, DL-DVI, HDMI, Dsub Panel Type IPS Pixel Pitch 0.23mm Colors 16.7 Million Brightness 350 Nits Contrast Ratio 1000:1 Response Time 8ms GTG Viewable Size 27" Resolution 2560x1440 Viewing Angle 178/178 Horizontal/Vertical Backlight LED Power Consumption (operation) 42W Typical Power Consumption (standby) 0.5W Screen Treatment Light Anti-Glare coating Height-Adjustable Yes, 4.5" of range Tilt Yes Pivot Swivel Yes VESA Wall Mounting Yes, 100mm Dimensions w/ Base (WxHxD) 25.17" x 7.89" x 16.70" Weight 12.44 lbs. without stand Additional Features USB 3.0 hub (4 port), Dell Soundbar Power Connector Limited Warranty 3 years Accessories DVI Cable, VGA Cable, USB Cable Price $799
The design and user interface of the Dell U2713HM seem to be up to the task, but how does it perform relative to other 27" models that have recently come through for testing?
We are regularly collecting useful JavaScript and jQuery snippets, libraries, articles, tools and resources and present them in compact round-ups here, on Noupe. This time we are again covering some useful JavaScript and jQuery techniques, plugins and tools that may help you improve the user experience for your site.
Useful JavaScript and jQuery Techniques
Colorful Sliders With jQuery & CSS3
In this tutorial we are using jQuery and the new transformation features brought by CSS3 to create a three dimensional dynamic slider effect. The techniques presented here – for creating sliders, and CSS dynamic resizable bars, can be used together or in part for powering all sorts of jQuery goodness.
Sponsor Flip Wall With jQuery & CSS
Designing and coding a sponsors page is part of the developer's life (at least the lucky developer's life, if it is about a personal site of theirs). It, however, follows different rules than those for the other pages of the site. You have to find a way to fit a lot of information and organize it clearly, so that the emphasis is put on your sponsors, and not on other elements of your design.
TipTip jQuery Plugin
TipTip detects the edges of the browser window and will make sure the tooltip stays within the current window size. As a result the tooltip will adjust itself to be displayed above, below, to the left or to the right of the element with TipTip applied to it, depending on what is necessary to stay within the browser window.
TipTip is a very lightweight and intelligent custom tooltip jQuery plugin. It uses ZERO images and is completely customizable via CSS.

A Fresh Bottom Slide Out Menu with jQuery
In this tutorial we will create a unique bottom slide out menu. This large menu will contain some title and a description of the menu item. It will slide out from the bottom revealing the description text and some icon. We will use some CSS3 properties for some nice shadow effects and jQuery for the interaction.
Making a Mosaic Slideshow With jQuery & CSS
Today we are making a jQuery & CSS mosaic gallery. Mosaic, because it will feature an interesting tile transition effect when moving from one slide to another.

Getting Buggy CSS Selectors to Work Cross-Browser via jQuery
Below I've prepared a simple table that describes a number of CSS selectors that are not cross-browser compatible, along with the jQuery syntax for each. The syntaxes are exactly the same as they would be in CSS, save for the jQuery wrapper (just remove $() and the quotes to get the CSS syntax), so using these selectors in jQuery will provide somewhat of a practice ground to prepare you for when they're fully supported by all commonly-used browsers.

How to show/hide a hidden input form field using jQuery
This past week I was working on a project at work which included building a request form with multiple fields. It was a rather large form that included a dropdown list with an ‘other' option. I wanted to allow users to select the ‘other' option which then would show an input field so they can enter a specific description of what that ‘other' item is. I didn't want to clutter the form by displaying that additional field by default so I used a little jQuery, thus displaying it dynamically and only when needed.
A Better jQuery In-Field Label Plugin
This is a pretty nice effect, and it can really help to save space on forms. There are a billion different ways to implement this, and I don't suggest you use the example from above because that was just a quick way to show the effect. So let's walk through a couple of different implementation approaches and figure out the best way to implement this feature.

On 17 October 2016, Maria Daly, the wife of a Millbury, Massachusetts police officer, reported a break-in at the family home, claiming that valuables had been taken. When police arrived, they found the letters “BLM,” which stands for “Black Lives Matter,” spray-painted on the home.
According to Millbury police Chief Donald Desorcy, there was no intruder, nor was there a burglary:
Something wasn't quite right. I think that was pretty obvious and as a result of that investigation, the officers did their due diligence and followed through with the investigation that we had. Basically we came to the conclusion that it was all fabricated. There was no intruder, there was no burglary.
CBS Boston reports the couple was having financial problems, and Daly told police burglars took money and jewelry. She posted to social media:
We woke up to not only our house being robbed while we were sleeping but to see this hatred for no reason. If you had asked me yesterday about this blue lives and black lives matter issue my response would of been very positive. Today on the other hand I have so much anger and hate that I don't like myself.
Her husband, Millbury police Officer Daniel Daly, has been cleared of wrongdoing in the incident. She has been charged with filing a false police report and misleading a police investigation.

Sebastian Vettel says he recognised the potential in 2017 title rival Lewis Hamilton the first time their paths crossed as youngsters in karting.
Despite winning seven of the last nine world championships between them, this year is the first time Vettel and Hamilton have properly faced off for a title. The pair is easily the most successful drivers of the modern era and have enjoyed dominant spells either side of the current V6 turbo era.
Both men were highly rated when coming through the junior categories but took different routes into F1 -- Hamilton won the 2006 GP2 feeder series before stepping up to McLaren, while Vettel was leading the 2007 Formula Renault 3.5 championship when he stepped up to F1 with BMW and Toro Rosso for the second half of that season. They had crossed paths before F1 -- notably in the 2005 Formula 3 championship won by Hamilton.

In an interview with former Red Bull teammate and rival Mark Webber on Channel 4, Vettel was asked when he first thought Hamilton would reach the top of F1, saying: "I remember him in 1999, he finished third in the European Championship in karting. And the team I was racing with was saying 'this guy, he will go all the way'.
"On-on-one was more Formula 3, I was in my first year, he was in the second year and blowing everyone away. I didn't get much chance, I joined him on the podium a couple of times.
"That was when you saw no matter what -- yes, [you can say] great year, second year so more experience, great car, whatever -- but whatever the conditions, he was always there and delivering. In the end when someone is always there, always delivering -- you might get lucky for a day, or whatever, but not for a year."

Vettel leads the Mercedes driver by 14 points at the summer break, with nine races to follow in the second half of the season, and is convinced he can still be ahead when the chequered flags drop in Abu Dhabi in late November.
"He's extremely quick, extremely gifted at what he does. I don't think it's a huge challenge for him to drive quickly or to adapt with different conditions and so on. He's always there. But he's not unbeatable."
However, the major theme I pulled out of this game after re-watching is how much Doug Pederson and Frank Reich utilized familiar spread concepts to help Wentz settle into his first career start. The gameplan implemented simple concepts and RPOs to maximize a number of Wentz's first read opportunities. We know that the one area where Wentz will require some development is going through progressions. The coaching staff did a fantastic job with quick step drops and packaged plays to ensure that more often than not, Wentz's first read was open Let's have a look.
Well that was fun, huh? I must admit, I didn't think Carson Wentz's debut was going to be as bad as many of the national media were suggesting, but I wasn't expecting anything like that. Carson Wentz had a terrific debut on Sunday showing amazing poise and confidence throughout the day and making numerous WOW throws along with some fascinating changes at the line of scrimmage. Much will be dissected of the all the things Wentz did great on Sunday along with areas of improvement but what I was really fascinated to see was how Doug Pederson would structure and scheme the offense around him. What was very encouraging on Sunday was that this was not a basic attack. I don't think Pederson really held back too much of the playbook from Wentz and as we saw particularly in the second half, Pederson was happy to let Wentz push the ball down the field.
The major theme was the implementation of some packaged plays or Run-Pass Options (RPO) which incorporated a run option out of the shotgun spread with a built-in bubble screen on the outside. We ran this concept over and over again on Sunday which is something Wentz was used to running at NDSU. The run option is a sweep to the bottom of the screen. On the top Wentz has a built-in bubble screen option to Darren Sproles:
Here, Wentz will read the outside LB. If he jumps to protect the bubble screen to the top of the screen this takes away an additional run defender. Wentz makes the correct decision to hand off on the sweep:
This really boils down to a numbers game and you can see where spreading the field really benefits the running game. The Browns have 6 defenders in the box. The key defender is #5 whom Wentz will read:
Post snap you can see that LB cuts off the bubble screen. As a result, the Eagles have 5 blockers for 5 box defenders and the middle linebacker is hesitant as he is guarding against both the bubble and the hand off to the left:
That MIKE ends up taking a terrible angle and the Eagles have good blocking up front thanks to winning the numbers game for a nice run from Barner:
Here is the same concept below. This time the OLB cheats in to defend the run:
Wentz likely makes the wrong decision here as you can see the numbers favor the bubble screen on top:
The other refreshing piece here to point out, is despite the RPO, Wentz should always have the option to keep the ball and run himself should the opportunity present itself. And of course unlike Sam Bradford, defenses have to respect Carson Wentz on that QB keeper. Here's that same sweep/bubble concept in the red zone that illustrates how much having a mobile QB here is a game-changer:
At the mesh point, you can see Jason Peters immediately releases to the second level and leaves the backside edge defender unblocked. Wentz will freeze that unblocked defender with his threat to run. Also note how many defenders both Wentz and the threat of the bubble screen on the backside take up in Cleveland's defense (5!!):
Brandon Brooks gets a terrific block on his pull, Peters overruns his defender in the middle of the field and Kelce has his defender lined up well:
Kelce doesn't get his man cleanly, if he does, this is likely a touchdown:
One more time, a packaged play with a sweep to the bottom of the screen and a bubble option at the top.
Once again, Peters leaves the edge defender unblocked and immediately releases with Kelce to the second-level. Brandon Brooks will again come this time on a pull. Wentz freezes that unblocked defender on the edge:
Kelce once again whiffs on his block but Barner is able to work around it and gets a terrific block from Brooks on the pull which springs the explosive gain:
Pivoting off the packaged play concepts Doug Pederson and Frank Reich did a really nice job of dressing up similar concepts in different ways. One related to the bubble screen above was the flat slant combo that the Eagles ran out of the Shotgun spread with a built-in run fake.
This next play on the surface looks like a simple run play, but if you watch the receivers closely you can see that this is another RPO as the receivers are running routes as opposed to looking to block defenders. Specifically, Huff is running the bubble to the flat and Jordan Matthews is running a slant off the line of scrimmage:
I wanted to highlight the positioning of the slot corner below as it will become relevant on the next play I highlight:
To highlight the RPO nature of this, the Eagles go back to the same concept a little later. It's a bubble to the flat for Huff and Matthews will run a slant underneath. Except, this time, Wentz does not hand off:
The slot corner reacts aggressively to the bubble when Wentz keeps thus Wentz has a nice throwing window to Matthews on the slant:
Here the Eagles take a mirrored flat-slant concept and dress it up differently with different personnel and some added motion from the tight end. On both the top and bottom of the screen the tight ends will run the flats. Ertz goes in motion to run a flat to the outside. The outside WRs will run a quick slant inside:
Note at the top of the screen as the defender chases Ertz in motion. This combination route has an additional asset as the WR running the slant runs a natural pick to free up Ertz in the flat:
Easy pitch and catch for the first down.
Carson Wentz will get all the credit this week (and deservedly so) but a major hat tip should go to Doug Pederson and Frank Reich for putting together an excellent game plan to allow Carson Wentz to ease into his debut in the NFL.
It's known that Romney stands against rights for LGBT people. In August 2011 he signed the National Organization for Marriage's (NOM) pledge to stand against marriage equality, appoint Supreme Court justices who would also oppose marriage equality, and support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would block the federal government from ever recognizing marriages between gays and lesbians. It should also be noted that Romney won the endorsement of the virulently anti-gay NOM after signing the pledge. It was later revealed that Romney also happens to be a major contributor to NOM. And all this despite a 1994 interview in which he said he would be "better than Ted [Kennedy]" on gay rights.
This week Romney apparently believes that it should be up to the states to decide whether or not a spouse or child of gay and lesbian men and women should have the right to visit their loved ones in the hospital. He believes that being able to visit a dying spouse in the hospital is a "privilege," not a right. Following mixed messages from Romney regarding his pledged support for the federal anti-gay-marriage amendment, Romney campaign adviser Bay Buchanan told Buzzfeed's Chris Geidner, "Governor Romney also believes, consistent with the 10th Amendment, that it should be left to states to decide whether to grant same-sex couples certain benefits, such as hospital visitation rights and the ability to adopt children."
In April 2010, recognizing the extraordinary miscarriage of justice and horrifying stories of families being split apart when fathers, mothers, husbands and wives were barred from visiting one another in the hospital, Barack Obama signed an executive order mandating that any hospital that receives government funding (including Medicare and Medicaid) recognize the relationships between gays and lesbians. One of the inspirations for the signing of this bill was the story of Janice Langbehn, who, along with their adopted children, was barred from visiting her wife as she lay dying in a Florida hospital.

Kannur: A priest has been taken into custody for raping a plus-one student who gave birth to a child at a private hospital here 20 days ago.
The vicar, Fr Robin Vadakkumchery of Neendunokki, Kottiyoor, was held from Chalakkudy, Thrissur, late on Monday night after the girl gave a statement against him.
Earlier, her father had confessed to raping her reportedly after being bribed with a huge amount. But the truth came out when the Childline authorities received an anonymous call and the police conducted an investigation.
However, the police did not confirm his arrest. Fr Robin Vadakkumchery is a vicar of St Sebastian's church and the girl aged 16 is a student of IJM Higher Secondary School, Kottiyoor, where the priest is the manager.
Fr Vadakkumchery faces rape charges as well as those under the POCSO Act, since the girl is a minor. The newborn, who was admitted to a private orphanage at Vythiri, was shifted to a government home at Pattuvam on Monday morning, said Peravoor CI N. Sunil Kumar, who is investigating the case.
I'm 90% sure that this is just a strange coincidence, but I've been researching Pizzagate and posting about it a lot for the past few weeks, and nothing would surprise me anymore...
Today, I left my house to go to the store, and when I came back ten minutes later, there were three men in my alley in plain clothes, one on each end and one right in the middle. They were not there earlier. I walked past two to get to my house, one guy ignored me strangely and one watched as I walked by. The guy on the other end just stood there facing the end of the alley till I got to my house. Weird thing that's literally never happened at my house before, definitely made me lock my doors when I got in. Have not seen them since.
Anyone else seeing guys standing awkwardly near their house lately? Are some of us being watched? I've been tweeting about the CIA a lot, and posting here. But they can't watch all of us, and I'm probably just crazy anyway, right?
Unless you're a die-hard 3DS collector, you probably haven't heard of Ubisoft's obscure 2011 platform release Cubic Ninja. Plenty of people are talking about, and seeking out, the title today, though, after a hacking group announced it's the key to the first exploit allowing 3DS hardware to run unsigned, homebrew code.
It all started early Monday, when the hacking community at GBATemp (known for publicizing many previous Nintendo console exploits) announced that a hacker going by the handle smealum got homebrew code running on a 3DS after months of work. The initial post noted that the exploit requires a specific 3DS game to work, but the group said they'd be keeping the identity of that title secret until the exploit was officially "released" to the public on November 22.
Since then, however, GBATemp says that "plans are accelerated," and smealum revealed on Twitter Monday night that the exploitable game was Cubic Ninja, a tilt-controlled action adventure that got abysmal reviews just after the 3DS' launch in early 2011. While the game is available for download through the Nintendo eShop, only the Japanese edition of the download can be used for the homebrew exploit, according to smealum. To get homebrew working on North American or European hardware, you need to track down an actual retail copy of the game card.
What happened next was eminently predictable: Cubic Ninja went from a bargain basement clearance item to an in-demand find literally overnight. Over on eBay, copies of the game were generally selling in the $3 to $7 range as recently as yesterday, with one copy finishing its auction as low as $1.04 last month. In the 15 or so hours since the exploit was announced, eBay sale prices have shot up as high as $40, with even the "cheap" North American Buy It Now auctions going for a minimum of $25 or so. Right now, one eBay profiteer is asking $300 for a new sealed copy, noting in the auction title that "This is the game you need for the Homebrew Project. These games are becoming difficult to find due to game developers hoarding these games."
It's the same situation elsewhere around the Web. A few weeks ago, Amazon sellers were offering copies of Cubic Ninja for as low $2.07, with plenty of listings for new copies well under $10. Right now, the cheapest copy available from an Amazon seller is going for over $24, with one seller asking as high as $500. New or used copies of Cubic Ninja were available for as low as $5 with immediate shipping at the websites for Gamestop, Wal-mart, and Best Buy just last week. Now all three retailers are sold out online, and copies are hard or impossible to find in stores, according to online inventory checkers.
In a final bit of irony, the game's original developers at AQ Interactive won't even be able to really enjoy the game's sudden unexpected surge in popularity; the Japanese company was absorbed into Harvest Moon maker Marvelous Entertainment shortly after Cubic Ninja's release in 2011. Ubisoft, which published the game outside of Japan, could theoretically cash in by re-releasing the title to retailers and eager consumers, but Nintendo probably wouldn't allow such a move unless the homebrew exploit was already patched out.
Once the exploit is fully publicized this weekend, players with a copy of Cubic Ninja will reportedly be able to launch a modified boot file on the SD card through Cubic Ninja, which will in turn install a "homebrew channel" on the system that can then run arbitrary code on the hardware. While Nintendo can and likely will update the 3DS firmware to stop this exploit, Smealum notes on Twitter that it currently works with all firmware versions on every edition of the 2DS/3DS hardware, and also stresses that the exploit can't be used to run "backups" of legitimate 3DS games, and it's only useful for running homebrew code, such as a version of Minecraft shown as a proof of concept in online photos.
Console hacking fans may remember that the Wii had a similar homebrew hack that required a copy of launch title The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. When that hack was patched out in a later version of the Wii firmware, a number of other Wii hacks were developed, some of which required copies of less popular game discs.
Even if other exploits are eventually found and developed for the 3DS, at least Cubic Ninja has already been rescued from a lifetime of ignominy to become a footnote in the history of the 3DS.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. - It is almost impossible to believe that Andy Dalton did what he did to the Jets on Sunday, after what the Jets did to him. The Jets' defense hammered him, sacking him seven times, hitting him every chance they got.
And still Dalton threw for 366 yards and his Cincinnati Bengals escaped the Meadowlands with a 23-22 win.
Why? Because too many of the Jets veterans made too many key mistakes, or disappeared when it mattered most.
And because Darrelle Revis looked like an old Revis, instead of the Revis of old.
There were a lot of people the Jets could point to for this ugly, painful opening-day loss. They could point to Nick Folk's first career missed extra point or the chip-shot, 22-yard field goal attempt that was blocked. They could point to the disappearance of Brandon Marshall (three catches, 32 yards on eight targets) and his big final-drive drop. And they could point to the two trips they made down to the Bengals' goal-line in the fourth quarter - once getting as far as the 1 - only to come up with a field goal instead of a touchdown thanks to what Marshall called "the poorest execution I've ever seen."
But Revis, 31, playing almost exclusively on Bengals receiver A.J. Green, had the ugliest day of all. Green caught 12 passes for 180 yards and one 54-yard touchdown, and only a replay review overturned the one ball he dropped. He beat Revis short, deep, and running side to side, and made him miss seemingly easy tackles.
In a season when Revis seemed intent on proving his doubters wrong after a subpar season, it couldn't have been a worse start.
"It probably wasn't one of my better games," Revis said. "But you've got to tip your hat off to the Cincinnati Bengals. Those guys played well. They spread us out a lot. Threw a lot of screens. They had a good game plan on us."
"We knew the Jets would bring a lot of pressure and we would get one on one coverage," said Bengals receiver Brandon LaFell. "We knew Darrelle Revis would follow A.J. Green around so whenever we got one-on-one coverage we took our shots and we made plays."
Yes they did, and Green made a ton on Revis. Jets defensive coordinator Kacy Rodgers had talked about using a group approach on Green, especially since the Bengals lost their second- and third-best receivers - Mohammad Sanu and Marvin Jones - to free agency this offseason. But Revis was matched up on Green almost the entire game. If help was supposed to come, it never did.
That was painfully obvious on Green's 54-yard touchdown when he ran deep down the middle, right by Revis and right by Jets safety Marcus Gilchrist who was as stationary as a traffic cone. As Gilchrist pointed one direction, Revis looked at him as if he was wondering why he wasn't moving. Green was able to get far enough away that he had time to wait for a slightly underthrown ball the come down.
Gilchrist called that "a miscommunication - that's what happens when you don't have everyone on the same page." Revis called it "a busted coverage" as did Bowles. But it wasn't the only one. The Bengals had two 54-yard pass plays, one that went for 49 and another that went for 34.
In between, the Jets' front line - which was missing the suspended Sheldon Richardson -- was hammering Dalton. They got 2½ sacks for Leonard Williams, two for Steve McLendon and 1½ for Mo Wilkerson. But the secondary kept undoing everything they had done.
"Our defensive line played exceptionally well today," Revis said. "They played awesome. In the back end it was just a little bit of miscommunication."
If that was it, then maybe they can get over it. But it seemed like much more than miscommunication. It seemed like poor game-planning and poor play, especially from a man who is supposed to be their best player. Even though Bengals tight end Tyler Eifert was out and the Bengals really had no other dangerous options, the combination of Green and Brandon LaFell caught 16 passes for 271 yards.
And of course most of that damage was done by Green, with Revis standing right nearby. "He had a great game," Revis said. "I can take a punch on the chin. He had a great game today. They game planned a lot. They said they were watching film of me the whole offseason."
If they did, then they obviously saw some holes and possibly even a player in decline. The Jets gave Revis a five-year, $70 million contract before last season with $39 million guaranteed because they believe he's still a shut-down corner. There were bad signs last season. And on Sunday, he didn't shut down anybody at all.
And that's a problem, because the Jets' defense is built like this: They've got one of the best front lines in football and a potentially great front seven and they have the ability to put all kinds of pressure on the quarterback. And in the secondary they need Revis to be Revis to cover for the lack of talent elsewhere. If he's not, it can all fall apart.
On Sunday, it did. Dalton took a beating in the pocket, yet somehow didn't miss a beat thanks to a series of big plays that never shoulld have happened. They wouldn't have if Revis was still Revis. And with what seems like a never-ending series of top-tier receivers headed the Jets' direction, they desperately need Revis to find his old form again.
Local movie buffs may soon be losing one of their prime venues if a redevelopment plan comes to fruition.
The owner of the Westchester Saw Mill Multiplex Cinemas in Hawthorne has proposed to tear down the 10-screen theater at 151 Saw Mill River Rd. and replace it with an Audi car dealership.
The dealership would be more than 67,000 square feet and include service facilities for the vehicles.
Theater owner National Amusements, Inc. is seeking site plan approval from the Mount Pleasant Planning Board. National Amusements, based in Dedham, Mass., operates more than 1,500 movie screens throughout the United States and abroad.
The planning board has declared itself lead agency for the project and is requiring National Amusements to complete a full state Environmental Quality Review (SEQRA), Mount Pleasant Building and Fire Inspector Sal Pennelle said.
The property is sited in a CR-B zone, which is intended for commercial retail. As a result, National Amusements would not require a zoning change from the town board, Pennelle said.
Supervisor Carl Fulgenzi said Monday the dealership would likely be an advantage to the town compared to the theater because it would generate less traffic.
“As much as I hate to see (a movie theater close) I'm not against a car dealership,” Fulgenzi said.
He added that since the site would be redeveloped it would continue to generate both property and sales taxes. If the dealership was built, a new assessment of the site would be needed to determine its property tax obligations, he said.
Repeated messages left for National Amusements during the past week at its corporate headquarters were not returned.
The city of Chattanooga has apparently found a buyer for the Chattanoogan hotel on Broad Street.
A city board will meet next Monday to consider several resolutions.
One item before the Chattanooga Downtown Redevelopment Corporation is approving the hiring of the Husch Blackwell law firm "as special counsel in connection with the preparation of a sale and purchase agreement for the sale of the Chattanoogan hotel."
The CDRC, which approved the start of the process for selling the hotel in July of last year, will also be asked to approve a resolution "approving the purchase price for the sale of the Chattanoogan hotel and authorizing the president to execute the purchase and sale agreement and any and all closing documents necessary to consummate said sale."
The city earlier sent out a Request For Qualifications for a consultant to assist in the evaluations and proposals for the sale.
Daisy Madison, city finance director who heads the CDRC, at the time said converting public conference centers to private ownership is a specialized area and a professional was needed so that the city can maximize the sale proceeds.
Benchmark Hospitality, which last year merged with Gemstone Hotels & Resorts, has long operated the hotel and conference center for the city.
The city built the hotel at 12th and Broad with a focus on it being a conference center, though there was some opposition to local government getting into the hospitality business and competing with private hotels downtown.
The Chattanoogan initially had some financial difficulties, but has been profitable in recent years as the debt for constructing it has been reduced.
It features 199 guest rooms and suites, a day spa and 25,000 square feet of conference space.
It also features three restaurants.

On another site, I got a little obsessed with this question I came across: How can I get sorted, human-readable output from du? It doesn't have a sort option, so you have to pass it to another program, like sort:But if you want human-readable output, you can't do that, because sort can't sort it numerically. Others were offering shell solutions that invoked du on each item twice, once before being passed through sort, and once after for the human-readable verison. Wasteful! After finding solution in Awk, I wrote this "one-liner":But then I realized it'd probably be better to use Perl for the sorting, and got this shorter result:Both of them return human-readable disk usage output, sorted largest item first:I almost posted this to the 'Obfuscation' area, but I thought this would be more appropriate.

We used to have police officers with radar guns giving out tickets for going too fast. Then photo radar was discretely mounted to parked cars on the side of the road. Next up, red light cameras. Now, since the boxes were already up on the poles, we may as well have the red light cameras give out speeding tickets, too. Pretty soon, every vehicle's GPS will be tracked, and drivers will be fined for every single infraction:
“Let's see, Mr Piedlourde, you exceeded the speed limit four times, failed to stop at one stop sign, and didn't signal while changing lanes. Total cost for your trip to the store: $813.00. Have a great day.”
So much for the open road, and the skies haven't fared any better.
Thorough pat downs… sure. Take off our shoes… okay. No liquids… fine. X-ray our luggage? Hell… why not just x-ray our bodies to see us naked. Whatever you need to do, oh great and all-seeing security guard, we'll just switch into sheeple-mode and allow ourselves to be corralled and prodded in order to reach our destinations.
And it's not just on the streets and in the air… these escalating levels of security and authoritarian control are happening everywhere. While some of these steps may make us feel safer, few, if any, of the new regulations and precautions are actually making us significantly safer. Most of these security measures serve as security theatre, where the price of admission is nothing less than our freedom and civil liberties.
Then, if and when the shit hits the fan (as it inevitably will) and another traffic accident happens or terrorists strike, what do we do? Do we recognize the futility in attempting to eliminate all risk from life? No, we mindlessly allow our civil liberties to be eroded as we cave to what are predominantly irrational fears.
Well, the time has come to say “Enough!”. We need to define a balance between freedom and security. No more additional precautions. To hell with more police powers. Let's draw a line in the sand- and it needs to be behind where we are now because we've already let it go too far!
If we don't stand up to authoritarianism, if we keep succumbing to fear and continue to enable a system that holds an ever tightening grip over our lives, soon enough the biggest threat will no longer be speeders or airplane bombers. If this keeps up, the greatest risk to our lives will be the very system we've created to protect us.

“I think it's probably better if you don't hold hands. You know how your father gets.”
That's what my mum told me last year when I arrived in Australia for Christmas with my boyfriend for the first time. My mum's statement felt like a slap in the face: After spending so many years struggling with myself, I was finally happy and totally in love.
My mum, who is Australian, was alluding to the more conservative background of my dad, who is Mexican. Like him, I was born and raised in Mexico, and like him, I experienced the conservative Catholic values and machismo that are the national norm there. It was for this reason that I‘d also had concerns when coming out to him. But the truth is, he couldn't have been more accepting, of both me and Joseph. When we left, my dad said, “Well done. He's a great man.”
In recent months, I've found myself reflecting on these events more and more. And last week, the contradiction came to a head: A few months after legalizing same-sex marriage, Mexico's Supreme Court legalized gay adoption. Just one day earlier, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott had banned members of his party from voting in favor of a new marriage equality bill, effectively killing it.
Like many in Australia and around the world, I was shocked, hurt, and appalled. How could this happen? In one of the world's most advanced democracies; in the country that hosts Mardi Gras and gave us Kylie Minogue and Priscilla, Queen of the Desert; in a country that prides itself on giving everyone a “fair go” and coined the term no worries. How could this happen?
It would be easy to blame the failure of marriage equality on Australia's conservative government and to further demonize Abbott as head homophobe. But the truth is, marriage equality has been up for debate in Australia for a decade. It's been there through two terms of a left-wing Labor government, and it still didn't make it through Parliament and into law. And while most Aussies now support gay marriage, we still elected a government that is totally opposed to equal rights.
The question remains: Why have Mexico's socio-cultural norms helped to advance legal recognition of same-sex relationships there, while Australia's values have impeded progress on equality?
Let's start with the church. Religion is a big deal in Mexico: 82 percent of the population identify as Catholic, compared with just 25 percent in Australia. If you've ever read Catholic doctrine or heard anything coming out of the Vatican, you'd think this would make for a very homophobic society. But when you consider that Catholic bastions like Ireland, Spain, France, Argentina, Uruguay, and Mexico have all legalized same-sex marriage, it's clear that's not quite right.
Catholic social values have changed dramatically. A recent Pew Research survey found that 60 percent of U.S. Catholics supported same-sex marriage, while a 2013 survey of Mexican Catholics also revealed majority support. Meanwhile, the referendum results in Ireland, where 84 percent identify as Catholic, speak for themselves.
The reasons for this shift in Catholic attitudes to homosexuality are vast and merit a more detailed discussion (for a great overview, check out Peter Weber's discussion in the Week). For me, though, the most important factor is the Catholic emphasis on family. As Mo Moulton writes in the Atlantic, Catholic doctrine, with its “emphasis on family ties and community cohesion,” was a key element in Ireland's same-sex marriage win.
Whenever I go back to Mexico, the dozens of cousins and second cousins and third cousins I have there—many of whom I haven't seen in years—are quick to embrace me as primo, inviting me into their homes and telling me all the family gossip. By contrast, in Australia, I didn't even know I had family outside of my first cousins until my grandmother passed away a few years ago and other relatives sent their condolences.
In a country where family is the basis for society, it's harder to exclude members of the population from legal recognition. It's harder to kick out your gay son or hate your lesbian sister. When the sacrament of marriage is the cornerstone of the family, it's only natural that this should be a right for everyone—as in Mexico. To see the contrast in Australia, one need only look at Tony Abbott's constant refusal to recognize the legal rights of his own lesbian sister.
That's not to say that there aren't homophobic Mexican families, or that Aussie families love their kids any less because they're not Catholic, but it is undeniable that family values have played a role in moving gay rights forward in Latin America. For us Latinos, blood is always thicker than water.
Another key factor is la revolución. Unlike Australia's calm progression to nationhood, Mexico's history has been marked by constant upheaval. From the bloody War of Independence in 1810 to the revolution a century later all the way to the current drug war, Mexico's development has been a fraught one. While this has certainly resulted in a more dysfunctional and often unstable political climate, one positive by-product is a greater willingness to challenge the status quo, what Octavio Paz describes as the Mexican desire to chingar. Australia has never experienced the kind of upheavals that lead to profound self-reflection and dramatic cultural change.
Revolution and the end of dictatorial rule has given rise to powerful social changes across Latin America, often framed in a human rights context. It's what Elisabeth Jay Friedman, director of Latin American studies at the University of San Francisco, calls “savvy social mobilization.” As I wrote in a piece for Newsweek last year, activists have been able to harness the new social movements that emerge after dictators are toppled, using tactics that have advanced human rights generally to advance LGBTQ rights specifically. This was particularly important in countries like Argentina and Brazil.
In Mexico, the spirit of revolution is embodied in its great capital, el Distrito Federal, which has been the epicenter of both conflict and change. The sprawling metropolis, home to 22 million, houses more galleries and museums than any other city in the world. It is here where the greatest Mexican writers, thinkers, and artists, from Carlos Fuentes to Diego Rivera, created their masterworks. Its magnetism stretches far beyond Mexico's borders, attracting everyone from Gabriel García Márquez to Leon Trotsky.
It's little wonder, then, that Mexico City was the first place in Latin America to legalize same-sex marriage, a decision that has had a dramatic impact in advancing gay rights around the country and across the region.
Contrast this with Canberra, Australia's small, provincial capital, and it's a little less surprising that its politicians are unwilling to embrace innovation. A city of countless roundabouts, everything in Canberra, including its politics, seems to go around in circles.
I'm being a bit unfair: Six dull years in Canberra gave me a poor view of the capital, where same-sex marriage was briefly recognized back in 2013. But still, Australia has been remarkably slow to evolve on social issues. Just 60 years ago, Aboriginal children were still being forcibly taken from their families; indeed, indigenous Australians weren't given full legal recognition until the 1960s. Up until the 1970s, the country upheld the “White Australia Policy,” which, in historian Charles Bean's words, was created explicitly for the “exclusion of Oriental peoples.”
We've come a long way since then, and Australia is beautiful place to live (especially if you're a straight, white male). Nevertheless, it's worth remembering that there is a strict, conservative streak stretching back for more than a hundred years; a long snake that has reared its ugly head in the form of Tony Abbott.
Abbott has explicitly refused to acknowledge any influence from international developments on gay rights, saying recently that “what happens in the United States is obviously a matter for the United States, just as what happened in Ireland [in its marriage referendum] was a matter for the Irish.”
Australia's political leaders have once again revealed Australia to be an isolated island nation. It gave the world Kylie and Priscilla, but it also gave us the xenophobic One Nation party and Abbott's appalling refugee policy. This kind of xenophobia also leads to a refusal to engage with the international dialogue of progress.
By contrast, Mexico often acts as a bridge between its powerful northern neighbor and its developing cultural cousins to the south. Unlike Australia, Mexico (like most of Latin America) has explicitly allowed itself to be influenced by landmark decisions in other countries. As Omar Encarnación wrote in the New York Times last year, “Latin American high courts have in recent years indulged in ‘trans-national legalism' to advance gay rights, by borrowing legal precedents from other countries, including the United States.”
I don't think Australia is particularly anti-gay. I don't think my mum, who now emails Joseph more than me, is at all homophobic. But I do think that behind Australia's sunny shores and cheery disposition lie dark roots of xenophobia, isolation, and a resistance to change that are worth acknowledging. And while I'm sure marriage equality will eventually find its way to Australia, maybe it's time the sunburnt country took a look at the wild land south of the U.S. border for a little advice on how to fully recognize love.
Iranian drones may soon be flying over Mexican airspace.
At least that's according to Alaeddin Boroujerdi, the influential chairman of the Foreign Policy and National Security Committee in Iran's parliament, who recently led a delegation of Iranian lawmakers on a 4-day trip to Mexico. The trip, which reportedly was the first of its kind since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, came at the invitation of Gabriela Cuevas Barrón, head of the Foreign Relations Committee in the Mexican Senate, who herself visited Iran on a couple of occasions this year.
The most concrete result of the trip was the signing of a memorandum of understanding promoting stronger economic, cultural and political ties between Iran and Mexico. The two sides also reportedly agreed to expand their cooperation in the oil sector.
Upon returning, however, Boroujerdi also said that Mexican officials had expressed interest in purchasing drones from Iran to use in its war against drug cartels.
“During my recent visit to Mexico they announced that [they] want Iranian drones,” Boroujerdi was quoted as saying by Fars News Agency, a media outlet close to the Revolutionary Guards, according to BBC Monitoring and Trend News Agency , an Azerbaijani-based private news outlet that regularly reports on Farsi-language Iranian news reports.
The English-language Iranian news reports on the visit did not mention drones. A review of some Spanish-language news found some articles referring to drones, but these too cited the Fars News Agency article as their source.
Without confirmation from Mexico, it's important to view Boroujerdi's claim skeptically, especially given that the parliamentarian also said that the “two sides stressed that the Americans have played the biggest role in the creation of Takfiri groups [Sunni extremist terrorist groups like ISIL].”
Still, the claim that some Mexican official-- particularly a potential member of the Senate-- expressed interest in Iranian drones, isn't as outlandish as it might seem at first. Mexico has long struggled to root out the powerful drug cartels in the country, and drones have become an increasingly integral part of its counternarcotics strategy. In fact, according to some sources , “the Mexican market for drones jumped seven times from 2013 to 2014.”
Mexico's interest in using drones to fight the drug cartels long predates 2013, however. Long before then Mexico secretly agreed to allow the U.S. to operate unarmed surveillance drones over Mexican airspace to collect intelligence on the cartels, as long as the intelligence was then passed on to Mexican officials. This agreement eventually became public setting off some outrage in Mexico where there are persistent concerns about U.S. violations of its sovereignty.
Although this practice continues, Mexico has also sought to build up its own UAV capabilities in recent years. In 2009, for instance, the Mexican Air Force secretly purchased Israeli-made Hermes 450 surveillance drones to use to spot narcotic smugglers in hard to reach parts of Mexico. Hermes, which are a popular UAV among Latin American countries, have a maximum altitude of 18,000 feet and can loiter for up to 20 hours. Mexican police also operate Israeli-made Skystar 300 surveillance aerostats and small Orbiter UAVs.
Besides Israeli-made drones, there i s a nascent indigenous UAV market in Mexico. The Mexican Navy was the first institution in the country to premier a UAV, but others-- including companies like Hydra Technologies and SOS Global -- have done so in more recent years. Still, the capabilities of Mexico's indigenous drones remain limited.
Bordering on the opium capital of the world, and strategically located to drug consuming markets, Iran-- like Mexico-- has also long struggled with narcotics smuggling.
Unlike Mexico, however, Iran has a fairly robust indigenous drone program. In fact, the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College has noted , “Iran has one of the oldest drone development programs in the world.” Iran's interest and deployment of UAVs actually dates back to its war with Iraq during the 1980s, but it has become much more pronounced more recently. In April 2013 alone, it rolled out four new drones : the Azem-2, Mohajer B, Hazem 3 and Sarir H110. The next month it unveiled the Hamaseh High Altitude Long Endurance drone. The Shahed 129 UAV Iran first unveiled in 2012 is a larger version of the Hermes 450 (It is widely believed that Iran has stolen UAV technology from Israeli firms on numerous occasions) with an alleged range of 2,000 km and an endurance of 24 hours.
Nor is Iran bashful about sharing its UAVs with other countries. There have been reports that Iran has sold or helped develop drones for numerous other countries and groups, including Hezbollah, Hamas, Syria and Sudan, among others. Of particular note with regards to Mexico, Iran helped Venezuela develop a UAV.
Thus, it's certainly plausible that some Mexican lawmaker or policymaker expressed interest in purchasing an Iranian UAV. And, Iran would undoubtedly sell Mexico UAVs were the latter interested as this would allow Tehran to relish in the fact that its drones were flying along the Mexican border. That being said, don't expect Iranian drones to be flying over Mexico anytime soon, at least if Washington has anything to say about it.

I am the proud owner of a 2006 Toyota Tacoma. This truck owes me nothing. But a couple of months ago my back starting getting sore after sitting in the truck for long periods of time. See, I have 170K miles on my five years young pickup, and I am in the seat for hours at a time. I removed the seat to find that the seat springs had broken on the upper part of the seat. I made new springs and hoped that would fix the problem — well it did not. So, I added some foam to the bottom part of the seat — that also did nothing to help my back. I decided to get a new seat.
Toyota wanted $2,200.00 for a new driver's seat and you have to put it together, you cannot get an assembled seat. So, I searched the web and forums to find a seat to buy. I found good feedback on Corbeau. They not only make seats, but also make custom seat brackets for your specific vehicle. I bought a set of brackets and seats. I chose the TRS wide in black cloth. The installation was a bit involved, but that is another post. While reading Corbeau's site I noticed they make office chairs out of some of the seats they sell for cars and trucks. I thought to myself — I could build that from my passenger seat! Since no one ever really sat in that seat it was in like new condition.
After the removal of my old seats and installation of the new seats I began work on the “Toyota Tacoma Desk Chair.” First, I removed the sensors for the airbag controls and the sub frame that attaches the seat to the floor. There are only four bolts that hold the seat to the sub frame, but you have to remove other hardware and brackets to get to them. Once that was completed I had to find a way to simply bolt a plate to the four seat mounting holes, so I could install the wheeled chair base to my Tacoma seat.
I used the following parts because they were free from my shop, but I am sure other parts would work. I used two angles 1/8'' thick by 4'' x 2'' I think they were about 15'' long. Then, I placed them inside the seat frame and marked the holes with a silver Sharpie. After drilling four 7/16'' holes to match the seat frame holes I used 3/8'' x 1 ½'' grade five bolts to make the attachment. Then I used a metal plate which is 3/8'' thick by 14'' by 15''. Again, I had this laying around at work. I centered the plate on the brackets I made. I then marked and drilled four 7/16'' holes in the four corners of the plate. I marked their locations on the installed angles and then removed the angles from the seat and drilled the mounting plate holes in them. Now I had to locate and drill four holes to mount the wheeled base from a old office chair, the base was in good shape, but the chair was beat. I used the position of the base on the old chair as a guide for my new chair — don't want to sit down and then flip over because the base was too far forward on the chair.
Now that all the heavy drilling was done it was now time to assemble the chair. I installed the angles and bolted them in, and then attached the wheeled base to the mounting plate. It would be almost impossible to mount the wheeled base after mounting the plate since there is very little space between the plate and the seat in the middle of the chair. Then I bolted the wheeled base and the mounting plate to the four holes in the angles already attached to the seat. Now I had a seat that rolled, tilted, swiveled, and reclined.
The fun part — getting the seat trim back onto the seat to hide the reclining release and the seat hinge. The seat hinge on the left (console side) was easy, I just had to drill a hole in the mounting angle so the plastic xmas tree would insert all the way in. The recliner release on the right side was interesting. I ended up using the trim from the console side of the driver's seat to make a cover for the passenger seat. That way both trim pieces would look the same. You will have to modify it to make it work, since the left side does not have an adjustment arm, just a pivot. After some cutting filing and sanding smooth I got the look I was going for. They are not exactly the same but very close.
I have to say, it is the BEST office chair I have ever used! Plus, no other common office chair reclines or has an adjustable head rest. Now all I need is a 4X4, 4.0L desk.
ALTERED: The Advertising Standards Authority is likely to continue its probe into a Napier billboard that claimed "Jesus heals cancer", despite its removal.
The Advertising Standards Authority is likely to continue its probe into a Napier billboard that claimed "Jesus heals cancer", despite its removal.
Last week, the Equippers Church in Tamatea unveiled the sign and added the number 6 in reference to the number of people it claims to have been healed.
The sign drew a heated response from several residents, including mother-of-two Jody Condin, whose 3-year-old son Toby is having treatment for leukaemia.
Yesterday, the church removed the words from the billboard, despite still defending the claim, replacing them with the Bible quote: "Jesus heals every sickness and every disease – Matthew 4:23".
Ms Condin said she was happy that the word cancer had been removed, as that was what had hurt her the most, but still disagreed with the latest message.
"I understand that the church plays an important role in giving people faith and giving support during an illness, but they can't cure all ... There are so many things they could say without picking on the vulnerable and sick."
An advertising authority spokeswoman was not aware of the new sign, but confirmed 28 complaints had been received about the original one.
Usually, when a sign that had been the subject of complaints was removed, the case was considered settled.
But because the Equippers Church had erected a different sign and still supported the notion of the original, the authority chairman would rule whether to present the case to the board, she said.
Pastor Lyle Penisula said that, although the cancer billboard had been changed so as not to "divide the community", the church still wanted the authority to rule on the original.
"Jesus heals cancer" was a message of hope and life and he had seen six people healed of cancer while at the church, he said.
One was a 4-year old boy in a similar situation as Toby, who had leukaemia and developed a hole in his heart that miraculously closed.
"Religious advertising and freedom of speech are vital components of a free and democratic society," Mr Penisula said.
Introduction
Health insurers have been telling us for years that their Medicare Advantage plans, which are federally funded but privately run alternatives to traditional fee-for-service Medicare, can provide better care—at lower cost—than the government.
One of my priorities when I worked in the industry was to perpetuate that notion. And I believed the PR, so much so that I encouraged my own parents to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan. But is the PR true? The answer is, we don't know, and we may never know.
That's because, as health economist and researcher Austin Frakt pointed out in a commentary last week in The Incidental Economist, neither the federal government nor the insurers that operate Medicare Advantage plans will make the data available to enable apples to apples comparisons.
The lack of data hasn't stopped the insurance industry from continuing the PR campaign. Whenever the Medicare Advantage program is threatened with a funding cut, the industry makes sure thousands of enrollees in the plans contact their Congressional representatives, and industry executives request opportunities to testify before friendly lawmakers about the superiority of Medicare Advantage plans.
In September 2012, for example, Karen Ignagni, then-CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans, read a long list of Medicare Advantage's supposed advantages to members of the House Ways and Means Committee. Many of them were indisputably true. Medicare Advantage plans are able to offer enrollees richer benefits because the federal government has for years overpaid insurers to encourage them to participate in the Medicare Advantage program.
Ignagni told the committee that 78 percent Medicare Advantage plan enrollees are in plans that cap their annual out-of-pocket maximums at $5,000. People enrolled in traditional Medicare often have to pay more, sometimes much more, if they need expensive care.
Ignagni also ticked off a number of additional services and benefits that only Medicare Advantage enrollees receive, such as vision, hearing and dental benefits, case management services, disease management programs and nurse help hotlines.
And she indicated that the care provided through Medicare Advantage plans produces better outcomes because of the ability of the insurers to coordinate care better than traditional Medicare. Medicare Advantage plans' coordinated care programs “provide for the seamless delivery of health care services across the continuum of care,” she said.
Ignagni's information was based on various studies that have been conducted over the past several years, some of which have been commissioned (and paid for) by the industry. At the 2012 House committee hearing, for example, Ignagni cited a study concluding that the Medicare Advantage hospital readmission rate was about 13 percent to 20 percent lower than in the Medicare fee-for-service program. She didn't mention in her testimony that the study was conducted by MedAssurant, Inc. (now known as Inovalon), a company that did data analysis for her trade group.
Columnist Wendell Potter Robin Holland
Frakt has written about studies involving Medicare Advantage plans and cautioned that, while the results can seem compelling, we can't be certain that enough data was made available to the researchers to give us confidence their findings are reliable.
Last Thursday, Frakt wrote about the most recent study to conclude that Medicare Advantage plans have an edge over traditional Medicare in both quality and efficiency. After analyzing the findings, Frakt found it as lacking in some of the same respects as previous studies.
“Most studies fail to convince one way or the other because researchers are not permitted the same degree of access to MA (Medicare Advantage) data as that for TM (traditional Medicare),” Frakt wrote. “For the latter, full claims over many years are available…For the former, some aggregate measures of utilization provided by plans are usually all we get, and when we get them, they're not over many years.”
As a consequence, Frakt added, “Comparing MA to TM is like trying to compare two houses, one of which you can live in, the other of which you can only observe through a few keyholes.”
Why only a view through a few keyholes? Because private insurers consider their data proprietary. They refuse to provide enough of it to make the apples to apples comparisons that would settle the ‘which is better' question once and for all.
As Frakt noted, one would assume that Medicare Advantage plans would do better on quality measures, if not efficiency measures, when you consider they get more money per enrollee from the government than traditional Medicare. Frakt also noted that manipulation of risk scores could be a factor in studies showing MA plans to have an advantage.
One notable finding from the recent study was that MA plans operated on a nonprofit basis do better than those that are operated on a for-profit basis.
Frakt wrote that, “The best way to decide (whether MA plans are better than tradition Medicare) is to do more research with more complete data. But, he added, “Until we're offered more than selected glimpses through keyholes at MA, we may never get the chance to do that.”
In a former Soviet car factory in the southeast of Moscow, the scene is like one out of a science fiction movie.
Tall shelves are stacked with computer processors jutting out into the middle of the space, spewing gusts of hot air. If you've ever observed your laptop fan kick in, multiply that by about a thousand.
The 9,000 square meter warehouses is where boxy Soviet cars used to roll off the production line. Now, it hosts the work of Dmitry Marinichev, President Putin's internet ombudsman who heads his own IT solutions company RadiusGroup.
In 2014, Dmitry Marinichev was appointed to the role designed to act as a liaison between internet companies and the government. He was also recently named one of four potential presidential candidates from Russia's "Party of Growth," a more Kremlin-friendly opposition party campaigning on a pro-business platform.
Marinichev is currently building what's called the Russian Mining Center, a project he hopes will put Russia on the cryptocurrency map.
Cryptocurrencies are virtual "coins" that are "mined" by computers completing complex algorithms. The most famous and widely used cryptocurrency is bitcoin. It exists on a shared data network called a "blockchain" and has no central bank or central authority, meaning transactions can be done between people and entities directly, without the need for banks or governments to be involved.
So far, Marinichev and his partners have invested $10 million dollars into the project. They've also raised the equivalent of $43 million in an Initial Coin Offering -- the cryptocurrency equivalent of an IPO -- and plan to add around five times as many "mining computers" to their facility by the end of the year.
The team manufactures the computers themselves. Playing host, Marinichev shows off a high-tech assembly line where 3D-modelled motherboards are stitched and soldered into life. Some will be used in this facility, others will be sold to other mining operations.
"First of all, it's business," Marinichev told CNN. "But this is a new milestone in the development of mankind."
Playing catch up
Russia is still a laggard when it comes to the official acceptance of cryptocurrencies.
Unlike the U.S. and much of Europe, it is currently illegal to pay for anything with cryptocurrencies in Russia or convert them into rubles.
And the central bank is not budging. In September, it issued a warning that the anonymity of cryptocurrencies could lead to citizens being drawn into "illegal activities including laundering illegal funds, and the financing of terrorism."
The central bank said it was "premature" to consider legalizing cryptocurrencies as a financial instrument. In October, the deputy governor of the Bank of Russia said the bank was considering restrictions on websites that sell cryptocurrencies.
Marinichev is hoping his project will prove to Russian authorities that cryptocurrencies, and the blockchain technology that powers them are a critical part of the country's future.
He's already seeing signs of progress. In June, President Putin met with Vitalik Buterin, the Russian-Canadian inventor of Ethereum, the closest competitor to Bitcoin. The meeting sent a flutter of excitement through the cryptocurrency community in Russia.
The Kremlin read-out of the meeting stated the following: "The President supported the idea of establishing ties with possible Russian partners."
Putin recently held a high-level meeting with his finance minister and central bank chief on cryptocurrencies warning of "serious risks," and could be used by criminals.
At the same time, however, he insisted Russia needs to come up with a way of regulating them.
That job has fallen to a special working group in the Russian State Duma, the lower house of parliament. And it's far from easy. Elina Sidorenko, a criminal law professor who heads up that group, said her biggest concern was initially the anonymity of transactions and the difficulty of applying anti-money laundering standards to cryptocurrency payments.
But she told CNN new challenges keep appearing. Her group had been set to publish new legislation in October, but it had to delay it for a few months to try to factor in some new issues: the implications of China's crackdown on crytocurrency exchanges, as well as how to regulate ICO's and tokens.
Still, Sidorenko is convinced Russia can't afford to ignore the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies to "advance the Russian economy."
"In addition to oil and natural resources, we have IT specialists, technologists, developers and computer geniuses conquering the world, so we should make use of this resource," she said.
Russia's 'Crypterati'
Russian cryptocurrency entrepreneurs are already making an impact. Alexander Ivanov is a former physicist, who now runs Waves, a blockchain platform that allows users to create tokens for things like loyalty programs and vouchers, trade in cryptocurrencies, and make payments.
The company claims to have a market cap of around $400 million and says 80% of its business is actually done outside of Russia. Waves was recently behind a blockchain loyalty program from Burger King in Russia called "Whoppercoin," where customers could accumulate digital tokens to redeem in store.
Ivanov said the attraction for him is the stability of the blockchain technology, and the fact that its decentralized so no one central authority can switch it off.
He said there's still a "barrier of understanding" for some people but that won't be forever.
"I think blockchain will repeat the history of internet and probably even be bigger than the internet itself," he said.
Ivanov and I visited a Moscow restaurant called Lavkalavka, which is part of a farming collective that uses local, organically grown products. It started accepting bitcoin in August. The meal cost about 0.02BTC ($100).
The restaurant carried out a mirror transaction in rubles to avoid falling foul of the Russian legal system. Owner Boris Akimov said accepting bitcoin is a marketing initiative at the moment, and a way to help the company better understand cryptocurrencies.
His business also set up its own cryptocurrency called Biocoin, which is used by farmers in their cooperative to trade in goods and equipment. Biocoins are also used as a loyalty system in Lavkalavka and other participating and restaurants. People are given a certain amount when they buy something, and can exchange them for future purchases.
In from the cold
There are many reasons Russia is drawn to cryptocurrencies. Akimov said the idea of a financial system not dominated by the U.S. dollar is part of the appeal.
"Cryptocurrency is a way to change the whole financial system in the world," Akimov said.
The banking system is currently under the stranglehold of U.S. and EU sanctions, and unable to access to Western capital.
"I can't say that bitcoin will allow for dodging sanctions [because] that wouldn't be true," Marinichev said. "Bitcoin can help the world change; it'll allow it to cleanse itself from the madness of some individuals, governments, parliaments."
So far, experts say Russia only has about 3% of all bitcoin "nodes" -- or computers -- on the bitcoin network.
Another advantage to growing Russia's share is the cold weather, according to Marinichev. This means the expense of cooling the mining equipment is dramatically reduced. Electricity is also cheap, and there's a lot of it available.
For Sidorenko, cryptocurrencies are a bit like the Russian winter: difficult to manage but inevitable.
"We must live with this reality, and we must regulate this thing," she said. "But we must minimize the risks involved in using it."
The following tutorial will teach any computer user how to install the Arch Linux operating system on their personal computer or laptop.
Arch Linux, the ultimate frontier! Well, the funny thing is that Arch Linux has become some sort of scarecrow for many Linux beginners, especially for those who were “trained” into Ubuntu or other “Linux distribution for the average Joe or Jane.” And that's because of the kind of painful installation process, which we'll try to simplify in this tutorial.
However, the truth is that once you install Arch Linux, you'll get a lightweight and flexible (do-it-yourself) Linux distribution, designed as a Rolling Release, which means that you won't have to upgrade every 6 months to a different release like some popular Linux OSes do these days. You install once and you update you system on a regular basis.
Arch Linux follows the KISS principle: Keep it simple, stupid! It will keep your system up-to-date and on the bleeding edge, so you won't have to wait six months for a new kernel.
What do I need to get started? The wonderful people behind the Arch Linux operating system provide a monthly updated ISO image, just in case any new Linux user wants to try the distribution. Get the latest version right now from Softpedia.
But, before anything else, you need to partition your hard drive for Arch Linux, so you won't have to do it manually from within the Live CD. For this, we will use the Parted Magic Live CD.
At this moment, you should write both ISO images on two different USB flash drives by following our very popular and useful “How to Run Linux from an USB Flash Drive” tutorial. In case you don't have two USB sticks, write the Parted Magic ISO first and overwrite it with the Arch Linux ISO image when you're done partitioning the hard drive.
So, insert the Parted Magic USB stick in a USB port, and reboot the computer in order to boot from the flash drive. Hit the F8, F11 or F12 key (depending on your BIOS) until the boot menu appears, in order to select the USB flash drive as the boot device.
Partition your hard drive:
Once the Parted Magic CD was loaded into memory, start the Partition Editor tool from the desktop...
Go to Device -> Create Partition Table and click the "Apply" button on the warning dialog...
Right click again on the unallocated entry and in the new window, type the size of your root partition in the "New size (MiB)" field (we recommend around 20 GB) and select the "ext4" option from the "Filesystem" drop down list. Type / in the Label field. Click the OK button and, in a few seconds, you'll notice a "/" line with the specified size.
Now, right-click on the unallocated entry and choose "New" to create the partitions. In the new window, type 2048 in the "New size (MiB)" field and select the "swap area" option from the "Filesystem" drop down list. Click the OK button and, in a few seconds, you'll notice a "swap" line with the specified size.
Once again, right-click on the unallocated entry, type the size of your home partition in the "New size (MiB)" field (usually the rest of the hard drive) and select the "ext4" option from the "Filesystem" drop down list. Type /home in the Label field. Click the OK button and, in a few seconds, you'll notice a "/home" line with the specified size.
Click the "Apply" button to make the changes. Click Apply again on the warning dialog and wait for the partitioning process to finish. Close the dialog.
Now that your hard drive has been partitioned, reboot your computer and eject the USB drive. As we said before, use the second USB stick or overwrite this one with the Arch Linux ISO image. Do the same as above in order to boot from the flash drive.
Wait for the image to load...
...and select the right architecture for you (64-bit for newer systems or 32-bit for old ones). Wait for the system to load, it will take a few seconds, and all you'll see now is this...
Editor's note: For those of you who don't know yet, /dev/sda is your first hard drive, in case you have two or more. To see on which drive you want to install, use the fdisk -l command, which will list all your drives, including the USB disk with Arch Linux. Therefore, if you have a single hard drive in your machine, which is recommended for most computers, use “sda” from now on during the entire installation process. If not, use “sdb” or “sdc,” depending on your configuration.
Before we start, let's execute a simple command, which will tell us if the hard drive has been partitioned correctly or not and if it is the correct one:
lsblk /dev/sda
...and the output is:
Now, let's activate the swap partition with the following command:
swapon /dev/sda2
Let's mount the partitions:
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
mkdir /mnt/home
mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/home
Run the following command to install the base system for your future Arch Linux installation:
pacstrap /mnt base base-devel
Hit Enter and wait for the download/installation process to finish, as it will take a few minutes, depending on your Internet speed. What will happen now? Some packages will be downloaded and installed. You can see the progress in real time. When everything is done, run the following command to configure system configuration file, named fstab, which lists all your partitions:
genfstab -U -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
And now, it's time to configure your Arch Linux system. Let's get in, shall we? Use the following command:
arch-chroot /mnt
So, we're in, let's set up the local language with the following command:
nano /etc/locale.gen
Scroll the file until you find your language and uncomment the # in front of it. For us it was en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8, which means English United States, Unicode encoding. Save the file using the CTRL+O keyboard shortcut. Exit it using the CTRL+X keyboard shortcut.
Run the following three commands, one by one, hitting enter after each one:
locale-gen
echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
WARNING: Replace en_US.UTF-8 from the above commands with your selected locale!
Now we need to specify the timezone, so run the following command:
ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Zone/SubZone /etc/localtime
Note: Replace Zone and SubZone with your country and city. Example: ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Romania/Bucharest /etc/localtime. Now let's set the clock depending on the country and city selected above: hwclock --systohc --utc ONLY for 64-bit systems: You need to activate the “multilib” repository. Execute the following command: nano /etc/pacman.conf ...and delete the # in front of the following lines: [multilib] Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist You know the drill, save the file using the CTRL+O keyboard shortcut. Exit it using the CTRL+X keyboard shortcut. Let's update the software repositories: pacman -Sy Editor's note: Please meet pacman, your best friend from now on. pacman will help you install or remove packages from your system, as well as keep your entire machine up to date. Let's create a password for the Administrator (also known as root): passwd Type the password and hit Enter, twice. Let's add a user now: useradd -m -g users -G wheel,storage,power -s /bin/bash softpedia ...and set a password for it: passwd softpedia Type the password and hit Enter, twice. Let's install the gatekeeper... just kidding, only sudo, with the following command: pacman -S sudo And now, let's give some rights to your newly created user. Execute the following command: EDITOR=nano visudo Scroll down until you find the %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL line. Delete the # in front of it. Save the file using the CTRL+O keyboard shortcut. Exit it using the CTRL+X keyboard shortcut. Let's install some more useful packages... pacman -S bash-completion grub-bios os-prober ...and setup the boot loader... grub-install --target=i386-pc --recheck /dev/sda cp /usr/share/locale/en\@quot/LC_MESSAGES/grub.mo /boot/grub/locale/en.mo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg Note: Remember to use /dev/sda or /dev/sdb in the above command, depending on your hard drive! That's it, let's exit the system and eject the mounted partitions: exit umount /mnt/home umount /mnt reboot When you get back, enter your username and password created during the installation. Now we need to configure the Internet, so run the following command: ip link Just like in the screenshot above, you'll see the name of your Ethernet connection, so use it in the following commands: sudo systemctl enable dhcpcd@<interface>.service sudo systemctl start dhcpcd@<interface>.service Note: Replace <interface> in the above commands with the name of your interface. For example: sudo systemctl enable dhcpcd@enp2s0.service / sudo systemctl start dhcpcd@enp2s0.service Let's install the X11 packages and the video drivers: sudo pacman -S xorg-server xorg-xinit xorg-server-utils mesa xf86-input-synaptics Nvidia users should use the following command: sudo pacman -S nvidia (for 32-bit users) sudo pacman -S nvidia lib32-nvidia-utils (for 64-bit users) ATI users should use the following command: sudo pacman -S catalyst-dkms (for 32-bit users) sudo pacman -S catalyst-dkms lib32-catalyst-utils (for 64-bit users) Intel users should use the following command: sudo pacman -S xf86-video-intel And now, it's time to install a desktop environment. Use the following command for GNOME: sudo pacman -S gnome ...or the following command for KDE: sudo pacman -S kde This will download a lot of packages and it will take some time. When everything is done, run the following commands to start the desktop environment: FOR GNOME USERS: sudo systemctl enable gdm.service sudo systemctl start gdm.service FOR KDE USERS:
sudo systemctl enable kdm.service
sudo systemctl start kdm.service
That's it! You should now see your favorite desktop environment. Have fun using Arch Linux, and don't forget to comment below in case you run into trouble with the installation.

The views expressed in our content reflect individual perspectives and do not represent the official views of the Baha'i Faith.
I grew up hunting and fishing in Washington State. My parents had five children, and not a lot of money, so during my childhood we caught or shot much of our food.
My father, a World War II Marine infantry officer, taught me to shoot. He had trained Marines on the firing range as an expert marksman and cared deeply about gun safety. He raised me, the oldest of his children, to know and understand the power of weapons, to use them extremely carefully and to respect the grave danger they represented.
When I came home from school my mother would often ask me to go get dinner. I didn't go to the store. Instead, I took my 16-gauge shotgun and my hunting dog Jinx and tromped into the nearby farm fields looking for a pheasant or a duck or a goose we could eat that night.
We didn't go hungry. My brothers and sisters and I even played a game at the dinner table – while eating the birds my father or I had shot we would see who could bite down on and then retrieve the largest number of lead pellets from the shotgun shell. We lined them up on our plates and counted them. Whoever had the most got dessert first.
When I turned 12, the time came for a standard rite of passage in the life of a young boy in rural America – hunting my first deer. My father, who brought enough venison home every year to feed us through the winter, took me hunting. After a cold day in the forest we spotted a big buck. I took aim. Then I suddenly realized, looking at that beautiful animal through the scope on my father's Winchester, that I couldn't pull the trigger. I knew the buck represented food for my family — but for some unknown reason I made the decision not to shoot. I felt terrible, but my father, to his credit, understood. Looking back on it now I believe that moment represented the dawning of something spiritual in me.
That day I put down guns forever.
Six years later, at 18, I made two important decisions. I became a Baha'i, and I registered for the military draft as a conscientious objector. The Baha'i teachings clearly taught me that I should forfeit my own life rather than take another's:
Let none contend with another, and let no soul slay another; this, verily, is that which was forbidden you…. What! Would ye kill him whom God hath quickened, whom He hath endowed with spirit through a breath from Him? Grievous then would be your trespass before His throne! – Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 45.
When I read that passage from Baha'u'llah's Most Holy Book, I knew immediately that I could not kill another human being. So with the support of the Baha'is and my new Faith I applied for and finally received my C.O. status, which allowed me to be drafted into the Army, but meant I would carry no weapon or be trained to kill.
In July of the following year the Army sent me to Vietnam, and for a year I saw what guns do to human beings. Yes, they kill people, but not only with bullets. They kill the spirit of the killer, too. The carnage and death all around me made me understand the wisdom of Baha'u'llah's command.
Forty years later, sadly, our repeated wars have helped turn America into a gun culture. We have more deadly weapons in our country than we have people. Guns have become easy to get and easy to use, and in the U.S. more people die from gun deaths than in any other industrialized nation.
So what do the Baha'is believed about guns? First, since Baha'u'llah said it is better to be killed than to kill, Baha'is do not take the lives of others. Also, Baha'u'llah called for disarmament of every type of weapon, not only by nations but by individuals. Accordingly, Baha'i law only sanctions owning and carrying weapons if absolutely necessary:
Baha'u'llah confirms an injunction which makes it unlawful to carry arms, unless it is necessary to do so. With regard to circumstances under which the bearing of arms might be “essential” for an individual, Abdu'l-Baha gives permission to a believer for self-protection in a dangerous environment. There are a number of other situations in which weapons are needed and can be legitimately used; for instance, in countries where people hunt for their food and clothing, and in such sports as archery, marksmanship, and fencing. – The Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 240.
Baha'u'llah said, describing the Baha'is:
• ‘I'm very proud of my performance for England' says former centre • Rob Andrew criticised Sam Burgess's inclusion in squad in new book
Sam Burgess has hit back at claims that his selection for the 2015 Rugby Union World Cup by the then coach Stuart Lancaster was an “almighty blunder”.
Burgess, who had never played union before joining Bath in October 2014, was controversially fast-tracked into the England squad less than a year after switching codes. When England failed to reach the quarter-finals in their home World Cup, Burgess, playing at centre, was made one of the primary scapegoats. His selection was bitterly criticised in a new book by the former Rugby Football Union director of professional rugby Rob Andrew who said: “Stuart Lancaster and Andy Farrell have always defended their position on this, but as far as I'm concerned they can say what they like: Burgess was a rogue ingredient in the mix, both before the tournament and during it, and his inclusion had a negative effect.”
Rob Andrew: ‘I'm not being alarmist … the game is getting worse, not better' Read more
Burgess, however, who returned to rugby league in Australia swiftly after the World Cup debacle, told BBC Radio 5 Live: “Rob wasn't really around the camp, Rob didn't see the work I put in, Rob didn't see how I contributed to the squad. Rob's sitting from – in my opinion – an outsider's view.
“I do disagree with him and I'm sure there are people out there who do know what happened, who understand what went down, how hard the training was, how hard I worked to get in that squad.
“I'm very proud of my performance for England and what I contributed to the team. Unfortunately results didn't go as we planned at that team but Rob's entitled to his opinion. He's trying to sell his book.”
In the book, Andrew had stressed that he did not want to single out Burgess but said: “I would not even begin to pin the blame for our embarrassing World Cup misfire on a single player, but the kerfuffle around the introduction of Burgess was undeniably the tipping point. To this day, I simply do not understand the thinking behind the fast-tracking of a player from international rugby league to international rugby union when so many of the things that had made him wildly successful in the 13-man game were of questionable relevance in the 15-man version. It was an almighty risk to select him in a World Cup squad on such extremely limited and highly questionable evidence and it proved to be an almighty blunder.”
After returning to rugby league with a contract with South Sydney, Burgess told the Guardian that he had no regrets about his time in union. “I was given a task at my club [Bath] to crack it as a six and we got to a Premiership final. I probably played one of my best games in that final but we lost to Saracens. I then got given the challenge to play 12 [for England]. There were four centres to be selected out of nine. I made the four, which took a lot of dedication.
“People might forget I chased some serious goals. Fingers will always be pointed but deep down I wouldn't change anything. The bottom line is that my heart didn't lie there [in union] and I didn't want to spend four more years doing something I didn't quite love.”
The dual-code international is now gearing up for another World Cup, in rugby league, and believes Wayne Bennett's side can go one better than the semi-final showing of Steve McNamara's class of 2013.
Burgess was in the England team that lost to New Zealand in the semi-finals four years ago and was captain of the side that, despite having home advantage, failed to reach the final of the 2016 Four Nations Series.
Dylan Hartley among three forwards cited on damaging weekend for England Read more
However, the South Sydney forward says preparations are going well. “We're four years further down the track. I had a little look through the squad and I see what we've got now and, no disrespect to the squad we had then, but we've got a little bit more X-factor, a little bit more solidarity within the team.
“It's been together for 18 months and the similar 17, maybe 19 players have been used. The combinations are a bit tighter and the camaraderie is great.
“We've got a really good chance over the next six weeks. But it's down to how hard you work when it gets hard on the field. Games can be won in the last few seconds and that's what it takes at this level, to concentrate right up until the final whistle.
“The mood is great. We've had a great week and a half over in Perth and now we're in Melbourne. The boys are relaxed and trained extremely hard. We've prepared really well. We're looking forward to it. It's going to be a great start to the World Cup on Friday, it'll be a physical game. We're more than ready.”
Taipei, April 24 (CNA) Three hospital personnel have developed respiratory symptoms after coming into contact with Taiwan's first confirmed case of H7N9 avian flu, the Central Epidemic Command Center said Wednesday.
All three had taken proper protective measures when providing medical care for the patient, a 53-year-old man who fell ill three days after retuning from China's Jiangsu Province, one of the H7N9-affected areas, the center said.
A survey of the epidemic situation showed that 139 local people had come into contact with the man, a Taiwanese businessman based in Jiangsu's Suzhou area, the center said.
Three of them had close contact, 26 had contact more than seven days ago (putting them past the infectious period) and 110 are hospital personnel, the center said.
Four of the hospital personnel have also passed the infectious period and have not developed symptoms, the center said.
A further three of the hospital personnel did not take proper protective measures when treating or caring for the patient, but none of them have so far shown any symptoms, the center said, adding that they will be strictly monitored until April 27.
The epidemic control center said that all those who have had contact with the patient have been served notice urging them to engage in self-health management.
They will also be subject to close monitoring until their respective infectious periods expire, the center said, adding that public health officials will help people on the watch list to get medical treatment should they develop flu-like symptoms such as fever or coughing.
The quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation said Wednesday it has posted information about the imported H7N9 case in Taiwan on its website and urged the Taiwanese trade association in Suzhou to help push Taiwanese residents in the region to step up epidemic prevention measures and provide them with news updates.
China reported the world's first confirmed H7N9 human infections March 31, and as of April 23, 108 cases had been confirmed there, with 22 deaths.
Two of China's largest cities -- Shanghai and Beijing -- as well as five Chinese provinces -- Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan and Shandong -- have reported confirmed infections.
As of 8 a.m. Wednesday, Taiwan had reported 129 suspected H7N9 cases, 128 of which have been ruled out as H7N9 infections, said Chou Jih-haw, deputy director-general of the Centers for Disease Control under the Department of Health.
The center said it had informed the World Health Organization and China of Taiwan's first H7N9 case earlier in the day, Chou said.
It was also the first H7N9 case outside China.

Earlier this month, a 28 year old Muslim from Skåne was awarded just over 6,000 euros by a Swedish judge because he had refused to shake hands with a woman. One can wonder whether the woman maybe should praise herself lucky. After all, she wasn't convicted for racism for the simple fact that she thought she could shake hands with a Muslim man.
More than four years ago, Alen Malik Crnalic entered a course with the Swedish Public Employment Centre (Arbetsförmedlingen, AF ) in order to find a job. In May 2006, he was on an interview in Älmhult for a trainee job as a welder, and during that interview, he refused to shake hands with the CEO of the company. The CEO happened to be a woman, and as an active Muslim, Alen Malik Crnalic says he's not allowed to touch women outside his own family. Apparently, he also avoided eye-contact with the CEO during the interview, and rather stared to the ground.
It should probably not come as a surprise that Alen Malik Crnalic didn't get the job. According to the company and the Public Employment Centre, he wasn't qualified for the job. Later he also lost his employment benefits. Alen Malik Crnalic didn't agree with that, and instead appealed the decision to the National Labour Market Board (Arbetsmarknadsstyrelsen, AMS ). The Board rejected his appeal, but then it was picked up by the Ombudsman for Discrimination (Diskrimineringsombudsmannen, DO ), and brought to court. There, the judge overruled the National Labour Market Board's decision, and awarded the man a 6,000 euro compensation. According to the judge, the claim by the man that he cannot shake hands with a woman because of religious reasons is valid. He should therefore have gotten the job even though he refused to greet the company's CEO , and the Public Employment Centre should not have canceled his unemployment benefits either.
Interviewed by the Swedish public broadcaster SVT , the CEO of the company repeated that the man didn't get the job because he simply wasn't qualified for it. She also added that she felt insulted by the man's behavior, since he shaked hands with everybody else during the interview except her.
The Ombudsman for Discrimination Katri Linna on her side welcomed the court's decision. In a comment, she said that it is unreasonable to cancel somebody's unemployment benefits simply because he refuses to shake hands with a woman in accordance to his religion and beliefs. According to her, Sweden is a multicultural country now, and has to accept that people have different ways to greet other people. One could wonder though what would have happened if the CEO had refused to shake hands with a Muslim job seeker because of her religion or beliefs, or where the discrimination would have been if the CEO had been Muslim and the job seeker a woman. To be honest, I'm not sure whether I should shake hands with Katri Linna if I would ever meet her, because you never know whether maybe it could be insulting to Muslim job seekers in Älmhult…
NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — Halliburton Co. shares slumped nearly 15% Thursday after the presidential commission investigating BP PLC's blowout in the Gulf of Mexico said the oil-services company may share some of the blame for the disaster.
A letter from the commission's lead lawyer said the investigation found that Halliburton HAL, -0.66% may have known the cement mix used to seal the Macondo was inadequate for the task.
The well ruptured April 20 as it was being plugged, killing 11 workers, destroying the Deepwater Horizon rig and triggering the worst oil spill in U.S. history.
The commission also pointed out that tests of the sealing job were either misinterpreted or not made by well owner BP BP, +0.02% or the drilling rig's operator, Transocean Ltd. RIG, -2.04%
Halliburton HAL, -0.66% shares briefly slumped to $28.86. They clawed their way back to end the session with an 8% decline at $31.68.
BP shares rose 50 cents, or 1.3%, to $40.60; Transocean fell 34 cents, or 0.5%, at $64.16.
Halliburton responded in a statement late Thursday saying that it “does not believe that the foam cement design used on the Macondo well was the cause of the incident.”
Halliburton said it is reviewing the government's report but also raised questions about some of the findings related to tests conducted on the cement before the disaster.
Emails to a BP representative seeking comment were not immediately returned.
The explosion on April 20 came after natural gas seeped out of the Macondo well a mile below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico and into the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig floating on the surface.
At the time, the well had been sealed with drilling mud, cement and other materials in preparation to convert it from exploration to production.
Halliburton and BP both had results in March “showing that a very similar foam-slurry design to the one actually pumped at the Macondo well would be unstable, but neither acted upon that data,” according to a letter to the full commission from Fred Bartlit, the commission's chief counsel.
The letter, which highlights the panel's preliminary findings, also said that Halliburton and perhaps BP “should have considered redesigning the foam slurry before pumping it at the Macondo well.”
The letter comes ahead of a two-day public hearing on Nov. 8 and 9 to be held by Bartlit and the commission, with includes Bob Graham and William Reilly as co-chairmen, as well as Frances Beinecke, Donald Boesch, Terry Garcia, Cherry Murray and Fran Ulmer on the roster.
The panel had asked Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.27% to test a similar cement-slurry mixture used on the Macondo well, with Halliburton agreeing that the company's lab was qualified for the work, Bartlit's letter said.
“Finally, we want to emphasize that even if our concerns regarding the foam-slurry design at Macondo are well founded, the story of the blowout does not turn solely on the quality of the Macondo cement job,” the letter stated. “Cementing wells is a complex endeavor and industry experts inform us that cementing failures are not uncommon even in the best of circumstances.”
The letter continued to say: “Because it may be anticipated that a particular cement job may be faulty, the oil industry has developed tests, such as the negative-pressure test and cement-evaluation logs, to identify cementing failures. It has also developed methods to remedy deficient cement jobs.
“BP and/or Transocean personnel misinterpreted or chose not to conduct such tests at the Macondo well,” it added.
In its own internal investigation, BP said a number of factors were to blame, including work by rig operator Transocean, cementing firm Halliburton and Cameron International CAM, +3.70% the manufacturer of the blowout preventer. See earlier story about BP's study of the Deepwater Horizon accident.
A young girl looks on as Donald Trump signs autographs for supporters at a rally on Feb. 27 in Millington, Tennesse. | Getty Simon Says Nader: Is Trump our father figure? Simon says: Trump has gotten where he is by embracing racism and bigotry.
"The press does not know how to corner Donald Trump,” Ralph Nader is telling me.
“He connects with those people who are sick of politics and those who have never been interested in politics. But these people know they are being shafted and they are impatient with politicians.
Story Continued Below
“Trump understands that. And he always exceeds expectations.”
Ever hear of the Ku Klux Klan? The KKK? Guys in white sheets? Burns crosses on lawns?
Sure you've heard of them. Everybody had heard of them. Except Trump.
Sunday, when CNN's Jake Tapper asks Trump about the Klan and how former Klan grand wizard David Duke has endorsed Trump, Trump is like, huh? Whuh? The Klan? Never heard of them.
“I have to look at the group. I mean, I don't know what group you're talking about,” Trump says. “You wouldn't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about.”
Trump is the front-runner for the Republican nomination for president, and he knows “nothing about” the Klan. Trump, as he tells us endlessly, went to these really, really great schools. But he doesn't know the difference between David Duke and Daisy Duke from “The Dukes of Hazzard.”
Tapper finds this a little odd. “I'm just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here, but … ”
“Honestly, I don't know David Duke,” Trump says. “I just don't know anything about him.”
Funny thing is, when Trump was initially asked at a news conference Friday about Duke's endorsement, he disavowed it. But by Sunday, under Tapper's questioning, he pleaded ignorance.
The media go crazy about this. Once again, some say Trump is “through.” He is damaged goods heading into Super Tuesday.
But why? If you were a Trump voter before, or even leaning toward Trump, why would Trump's feigned ignorance about the Klan upset you?
Trump has gotten where he is by embracing racism and bigotry. He got to the top of the Republican polls after he said Mexicans are rapists and Muslims should not be allowed into the United States. So why should an endorsement by a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan hurt him? It will probably gain him 2 or 3 percentage points.
“People are looking for a strong man,” Nader, who knows a thing or two about running for president, is saying. “That's the sign of the decay of our society. Trump says: ‘Anyone who attacks us, I will blow them out of water.' People want this reassurance, this father figure.”
Monday, in a speech in Radford, Virginia, Trump laid it out in very simple terms. “We are looking for security. We are looking for safety. We are looking for good homes. We are looking for good health care. We are looking for a strong military that can protect us from evil.”
In eight years, we have gone from a candidate who won the presidency through inspiration and eloquence to one who uses language an eighth-grader could understand.
Don't knock it.
“His appeal is clarity,” says Nader. “His sentences are very brief: ‘We are being screwed. I will build a wall.' Put that together with his bluster and his image as a brawler and he gets the attention of those who could never watch debates without falling asleep.
“Wordplay is Trump's genius.”
And who will stop him? Nobody will stop him. He understands the Republican Party of 2016 because he is the Republican Party of 2016.
“Trump is like climate change,” Bill Maher has said. “We knew it was coming, and now it's too late.”
Marco Rubio is giving it a college try. Almost literally: Over the weekend, at a university in Virginia, he sounded like a frat boy at his first kegger.
“You know what they say about guys with small hands!” Rubio said about Trump as the crowd roared.
And Trump “doesn't sweat because his pores are clogged from the spray tan.”
“Donald Trump isn't gonna make America great,” Rubio said. “He's gonna make America orange!”
Nader did not find this encouraging. “How demeaning this is to our posterity,” Nader said.
But somebody is going to be the next president. Whom does Nader want?
“I don't want to choose between cancer and drug-resistant tuberculosis,” Nader said.
The Republican Party may shatter over Trump. Historians will make Trump's rise to the top look obvious, but it was not. I don't recall anybody predicting it.

GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Vince Biegel won't be on the field for Green Bay Packers minicamp this week, and he might not even be ready for the first training camp practice on July 27.
The rookie fourth-round pick should be good to go for the Sept. 10 season opener, though.
That was the sense coach Mike McCarthy gave on the eve of the mandatory minicamp, which runs Tuesday through Thursday. Biegel underwent foot surgery last month after a problem was discovered during rookie camp. It was the same foot that sent Biegel to surgery during his senior season at Wisconsin last fall.
"He'll be ready to go hopefully in training camp," McCarthy said.
Note that McCarthy said “in training camp” and not “by training camp,” which means Biegel might have to start out on the physically unable to perform list. A player who doesn't pass his physical to start training camp goes on PUP but can be activated any time during the preseason.
Biegel already has missed critical reps at a position that lacks depth after Julius Peppers and Datone Jones departed in free agency. The Packers don't have a lot of experience behind starting outside linebackers Clay Matthews and Nick Perry. With veterans excused from this week's minicamp, this would have been a productive set of practices for Biegel, who was the only outside linebacker the Packers drafted. Instead, he'll likely watch Kyler Fackrell and Jayrone Elliott line up as the starters with what's left of the No. 1 defense.
The Wisconsin Rapids native was a popular pick among Packers fans, some of whom hoped the team would draft Biegel's Badgers teammate T.J. Watt. Biegel was the feel-good story of the Packers' draft, but that story took a hit when problems with his foot returned. He underwent surgery last fall to have a screw implanted into his right foot. It's unclear if his quick return -- he missed only two games -- prevented the injury from fully healing, but the Packers felt by undergoing a second surgery in the offseason, it would prevent problems down the road.
"He's getting better," McCarthy said. "He's there every day [at Lambeau Field]. He's diligent."
Good news for FIOS customers: Verizon's fiber network is now officially the fastest way to access Netflix in the U.S., at least if you discount regional ISPs with smaller footprints like Google Fiber. Verizon customers streamed their movies and TV shows with 3.17 Mbps of bandwidth on average, according to Netflix's latest ISP speed index.
That's a huge improvement over previous months: In July, the average FIOS stream was at just 1.61 Mbps. [company]Netflix[/company] and [company]Verizon[/company] improved the experience for FIOS customers dramatically with a commercial peering agreement that lets Netflix directly interconnect with Verizon in exchange for some hard cold cash. Netflix has struck similar agreements with [company]Comcast[/company], [company]AT&T[/company] and [company]Time Warner Cable[/company], but at the same time publicly insisted that it shouldn't have to pay ISPs for peering.

And even with these agreements, U.S. ISPs are still performing significantly worse than their European counterparts. Across all of Netflix's markets, U.S. ISPs currently rank 14th, and fall behind not only Canada, but also every single European country that Netflix is operating in.
Netflix's fastest average speeds were in Switzerland with 3.81 Mbps, with Belgium coming in second with 3.77 Mbps and streams in Austria average 3.66 Mbps. The average U.S. Netflix stream on the other hand was 2.72 Mbps in September.
As always, it's worth pointing out that these averages are not only influenced by the type of content viewers access, but also the devices they are using, with SD streams consuming less data than HD streams, and streaming to mobile devices typically being less consuming than streaming to 1080p TV sets.
But it looks like Netflix has prepared itself for its recent European expansion to avoid any slow-downs similar to those that affected customers of many U.S. ISPs earlier this year. The company has struck broad agreements with European ISPs, which often include putting Netflix's app on their set-top boxes, and a source within the French ISP community told me that Netflix is directly peering with Orange with a capacity of approximately 50 Gbps.
Shopping in VR is one of those things that sounds incredibly obvious: all the convenience of Amazon, without the slightly impersonal feeling of looking at pictures on a screen. But no one seems sure what makes in-store shopping special. Is it looking at real versions of the items you're going to buy? Is it little extras like fashion show clips? Or is it the literal feeling of being inside the building?
Retale, the deal-finding service that raised $12 million earlier this year, could help us figure out the answer. The company has announced that it's launching an Oculus Rift-based counterpart to its mobile app, set for release when the Rift goes on sale in early 2016. It could also theoretically come to other platforms; Retale says the company is starting with the Rift and will "determine where to go next" once it's launched. While a number of prototypes and concept designs have shown us what VR shopping could look like, this may be the most concrete plan yet for an actual app.
It may also be one of the weirdest, because Retale isn't exactly a shopping tool. It's a digital version of the weekly promotional circulars that stores like Walmart or Target hand out, using location data to find nearby stores and display sales from them. Based on the screenshots and video we've seen so far, Retale VR directly transplants that deal-browsing experience into the Oculus Rift, then lets users enter what it calls a "virtual showroom" to look more closely at a store's offerings. The showrooms are officially branded, and Retale says all its major partners will be signed on to the VR app, though it's only revealed three for now: Target, JCPenney, and Macy's.
But you're apparently not making purchases there. Instead, Retale directs you to a nearby retail outlet, sending a phone push notification with directions and your shopping list. Which means that you're going to a virtual store in order to prepare for going to a real store. It's not totally clear that this makes any sense at all, unless the showrooms are exciting in their own right or the app adds features that someone couldn't get in the real world — like the ability to see products in different rooms or situations.
Retale president Pat Dermody tells The Verge that the virtual experience will let you "encounter the products more deeply without ever leaving the comfort of your sofa" — it's supposed to be an improvement over seeing pictures, but not the same as seeing it in a store. Again, it's not clear that we need that extra step if you'll be going to the store anyways, but it's hardly the only VR app to throw features at the wall until something sticks.
A few months out from the Oculus Rift's release, most of the VR apps we know about are built around gaming or video, although it's also possible to do things like browse the web and make collaborative art. On one hand, apps like Retale are a signal that companies are taking the system seriously, looking for ways that people might use it in everyday life. On the other, it's not difficult to build a basic 3D environment and interface. Virtual reality is a powerful promotional tool, and simply having a presence on a much-hyped new platform might matter more than the actual content.
Either way, though, this is a step past something like a Google Cardboard app or a 360-degree YouTube video. And while Retale doesn't yet have much competition in the Rift-based shopping world, that's likely to change in the coming months. QVC VR? The Etsy Virtual Showroom? Oh yes, they're coming.
Update and correction December 16th, 1:45PM ET: Added statement from Retale president. A previous version said that all major partners had signed up, but Retale clarifies that all major partners will be signed up for the launch.
After more than 15 years of US troops presence in Afghanistan, President Donald Trump unveiled on Monday a new strategy for the country and cleared the way to send thousands more US troops there.
Currently, 8,400 American soldiers are taking part in NATO's operation in Afghanistan, which comprises a total of 13,000 troops in all. Most of them are charged with overseeing and training Afghan forces.
Below are developments in the US military presence in the country.
2001: ' War on terror '
On October 7, 2001, less than a month after the September 11 attacks, US President George W Bush launches operation "Enduring Freedom" in Afghanistan, after the Taliban refuses to hand over al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
In a matter of weeks, the US-led forces overthrow the Taliban, in power since 1996.
Apart from air raids, the US backs the Afghan Northern Alliance, which is fighting the Taliban, contributing paramilitary teams from the CIA and special forces.
Some 1,000 American soldiers are deployed on the ground in November, rising to 10,000 the year after.
2003-2008: Taliban regroups, Bush sends more troops
Attention is diverted from Afghanistan as US forces in 2003 mount an invasion of Iraq, which becomes the main US concern.
The Taliban and other armed groups regroup in their strongholds in the south and east of Afghanistan, from where they can easily travel to and from Pakistani tribal areas.
In 2008, the American command on the ground calls for manpower to carry out an effective strategy against the Taliban. Bush agrees to send additional soldiers and by mid-2008 there are 48,500 US troops there.
2009: Number of soldiers peaks under Obama
In 2009, in the first months of the presidency of Barack Obama - elected on campaign promises to end the two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan - there is a surge in the number of American soldiers in Afghanistan to around 68,000.
In December, Obama raises the strength of US forces in Afghanistan to around 100,000. The objective, the US says, is to put brakes on the Taliban and to strengthen Afghan institutions.
2011: Bin Laden killed in Pakistan
Al-Qaeda leader Bin Laden, alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks that started the war, is killed on May 2, 2011 during an operation by US special forces in Pakistan, where he is in hiding.
2014: End of combat operations
In September 2014, Afghanistan signs a bilateral security accord with the US and a similar text with NATO: 12,500 foreign soldiers, of which 9,800 are Americans, will remain in the country in 2015, after the end of the NATO combat mission at the end of 2014.
From the beginning of 2015, American troops will be charged with two missions: "anti-terrorist" operations against al-Qaeda and training Afghan forces.
In late December, the NATO combat mission ends, and is replaced by an assistance mission baptised "Resolute Support".
However, the security situation degenerates.
Amid a resurgent Taliban, on July 6, 2016, Obama again slows down the pace of withdrawal, saying that 8,400 US troops will remain in Afghanistan into 2017.
2015: US bombs MSF clinic
On October 3, 2015, at the height of combat between armed groups and the Afghan army, backed by NATO special forces, a US air raid bombs a hospital run by Medecins Sans Frontiers (Doctors Without Borders) in northern Kunduz province, killing 42, including 24 patients and 14 members of the NGO.
April, 2017: 'MOAB' - Mega bomb against ISIL
On April 13, 2017, the US military drops the largest non-nuclear bomb it has ever used in combat, hitting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group positions in a network of tunnels and caves in the east, killing 96 fighters.
In July, the American army kills the ISIL's new leader in Afghanistan, the third such chief slain by Washington and Kabul.
Feb - August, 2017: New strategy
On February 1, 2017, a US government report says that losses of Afghan security forces have climbed by 35 percent in 2016 compared with the previous year.
On February 9, the US general in command of the NATO force, General John Nicholson, warns that he needs thousands more troops, telling Congress: "I believe we're in a stalemate."
On August 21, Trump cleared the way for the deployment of thousands more US troops to Afghanistan in his first formal address to the nation as commander-in-chief.
Following the president's speech, US Defense Secretary James Mattis announced that America and several allies have committed to boosting their troop numbers in Afghanistan.
Senior White House officials say Trump has already authorised Mattis to deploy up to 3,900 more troops to Afghanistan.
Paul Doherty was awaiting an MRI last year when his gurney was sucked into the machine.
The MRI scan had gone smoothly, the huge machine searching for clues to Paul Doherty's excruciating back pain. But the technician who then moved Doherty onto a gurney in the hallway inadvertently wheeled him back into the MRI room, doing what should never be done: bringing a metal object into a space radiating with magnetic power.
The MRI's magnet began to drag the bed toward it — with Doherty still on it. The employee shouted for help and two colleagues rushed in. They immediately realized that even the three of them were not strong enough to combat an MRI. They helped Doherty off and let the bed go.
Out in the hallway, they heard a crunching metallic noise something like a car crash. The gurney had mashed into the magnetic resonance imaging machine, where it would stay for the next three days.

No one was injured in this accident in February 2016 at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. But the incident highlights the hazards of a technology with risks that are becoming more widely appreciated. MRIs have always been considered to be safer and require less regulation than X-rays or CT scans, which emit ionizing radiation that can cause cancer.

But MRIs can turn common metal objects like hammers, oxygen tanks, and floor polishers into projectiles.
More typically, they can cause burns and hearing damage — injuries that some safety specialists fear are increasing in frequency, given the growing power and speed of the machines. MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields and radio waves to generate images of the organs inside the body.
And while the Brigham employs the latest safety measures — measures that were refined after last year's accident — the industry overall needs more rigorous standards and oversight, said Dr. Emanuel Kanal, MRI director at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and a well-known safety expert.
Moreover, it's hard to know how often accidents occur or if they are increasing, because no national organization or agency collects reliable data on MRI injuries and near-accidents.

Even Massachusetts, which requires hospitals and surgery centers to report deaths and serious injuries caused by metal objects in MRIs, does not track near-misses. Between 2012, when the rules went into effect, and 2015, hospitals reported four injuries.
Safety experts applauded the Brigham for openly discussing last year's accident in a recent hospital newsletter, an education forum with employees, and subsequently with the Globe. These types of incidents are often kept private, due to embarrassment, making it difficult for health care providers to learn from one another's mistakes, said Frank Shellock, a longtime MRI safety specialist affiliated with the University of Southern California.
“This absolutely happens elsewhere, but people won't talk about it,'' Shellock said. “There is no good source of information'' about the frequency of accidents, he added.
The worst accidents often make headlines.
The most horrifying occurred in 2001, when 6-year-old Michael Colombini was undergoing an MRI at Westchester Medical Center in New York. The machine turned an oxygen canister into a missile, which struck and killed the boy.

After his death, the American College of Radiology created an expert panel that developed safety guidelines for MRIs, which are 1,000 times stronger than a refrigerator magnet. But the college did not start inspecting the centers it accredits until more recently, said Kanal, who led the effort to write the guidelines. Accreditation is voluntary, he added.
And in many states, Kanal said, there is no required training or certification for technicians who run the machines.
Most projectile accidents occur because hospital staff did not realize that MRI magnets are always on, even when the electricity is off.
In 2014, two hospital workers in New Delhi were pinned to an MRI for four hours by a massive oxygen tank. Both were injured and fell unconscious as workers struggled to free them, according to media reports at the time.
In Boston, Children's Hospital, Tufts Medical Center, and Massachusetts General Hospital said they have had projectile accidents in past years.
At Children's in 2015, two metal rods in a plastic waste container lid were pulled onto an MRI. An employee suffered shoulder and neck strain trying to dislodge them — one of the injuries reported to state regulators since 2012.
Also in 2015, a metal pole used to transport intravenous medicine flew into a magnet at Tufts Medical Center; nine years ago, a maintenance worker there walked in with a hammer that was sucked into an MRI. No one was injured. An anesthesia cart flew into an MRI at MGH almost two decades ago.
All those accidents prompted new safety measures, as did the accident at the Brigham last year.
Doherty, 52, arrived in the Brigham emergency room in February 2016 in great pain.
The next morning an anesthesiologist gave him strong pain killers to keep him comfortable during the MRI test, he said. Before entering the MRI room, he was transferred to a special nonmetal bed. After the scan, the technician transferred Doherty back to the regular gurney in the hallway — but then mistakenly backed up into the room, rather than into the corridor.
Doherty said his gurney began to spin around and the technician yelled for help.
Tuan Luu, another technician working nearby, hurried in. “I was pretty amazed by what was going on,'' he said.
He grabbed the bed but quickly realized they would not be able to free it from the magnet's pull. He and a cardiologist lifted Doherty off the bed and out of the room. “My colleague was still holding onto the stretcher for dear life,'' Luu said. “I said we best just let it go.''
A magnet drew in a gurney that was wheeled into an MRI room at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Doherty, the patient on the gurney, was not hurt.
Doherty watched through a window as it was slowly and inexorably sucked in. “It was making the most awful noise,'' he said. “I didn't realize at that point how lucky I was.''
The hospital applied a review system called “just culture'' when it examined the incident. That meant it looked for gaps in its policies and procedures, rather than blaming the technician who wheeled the bed into the room. He had been working 10 hours straight to keep up with the workload, leading to a discussion with technicians about taking breaks.
The Brigham, which expects to do 71,000 MRIs this year, installed safety straps across the doors of its MRI rooms. They have to be unhooked before a person can enter, helping stop someone from entering absent-mindedly if the door is open.
The hospital believes “alarm fatigue,'' which occurs when health care workers are desensitized to constant alarms, also played a role in the accident. Before the incident, an alarm would sound whenever a ferromagnetic object was nearby; now they go off only when the object crosses the threshold, significantly reducing the number of alarms.
The near-accident also prompted discussion at the Brigham about an extreme measure called quenching.
Punching the red quench button for an MRI powers down the magnet in less than a minute. But this action carries risks of its own — potentially causing a breathing hazard if very cold helium escapes from the magnet into the room — and can permanently damage the machine.
Many technicians and radiologists have been trained that quenching should occur only very rarely and only in life-threatening situations.
Gradually powering down the magnet over several days is generally considered safer — this is what happened after the Brigham gurney slammed into the machine. But after discussions with the manufacturer, GE Healthcare, the hospital decided it was in line for a culture shift.
“We want employees to know they are empowered to quench,'' said Dr. Srini Mukundan, medical director for MRI.
The Brigham reported two incidents to public health officials in prior years. They involved patients with metal implants, which the MRI magnet can dislodge or damage.
One patient did not disclose a metal device implanted under the skin. The patient required follow-up monitoring. Another patient had a cochlear implant that was not properly removed before the MRI. The patient experienced initial pain and the implant required repair.
Dr. Jerry Froelich, chairman of the American College of Radiology's MRI safety commission, said he is more concerned about burns and hearing damage that sometimes result from MRIs, than about projectiles.
“Those incidents are probably 10 times higher than what we hear about,'' he said.
Burns can occur when the machine heats up tattoos that contain iron, or metal implants like pacemakers. Many people with implants cannot have MRI scans.
The stronger and faster the magnet, the louder it is, making it necessary for MRI facilities to give patients headphones or earplugs.
“It's a horsepower race,” he said. “People continue to push the boundaries of the field. It takes a lot more oversight because the risk is so much higher.''

BEIRUT – A retired high-ranking Syrian intelligence official has been killed outside Latakia in a grisly murder blamed on militiamen loyal to the government, the latest instance of wanton criminality to rock the regime's coastal bastion.
“Unknown perpetrators committed a dreadful murder Tuesday morning after entering the villa of retired Colonel Adnan Mahmoud in the Sheikh Hasamo area outside [Latakia's] Al-Haffa, killing him and one of his wives in addition to the estate's caretaker,” a journalist in the regime's Al-Baath newspaper reported.
The reporter added that Mahmoud formerly served as the “head of the investigative branch,” without specifying in which of the Syrian regime's numerous security apparatuses.
However, a pro-rebel Facebook outlet went into details on Mahmoud's career, claiming that he headed the office of then Political Security Directorate chief Adnan Badr Hassan—who held the position from 1987 to 2012—before becoming the director of the intelligence agency's investigative branch.
Meanwhile, the popular Latakia News Network—which supports the regime—identified the murdered colonel as the former “head of the political investigative branch,” an implicit reference to the department in the Political Security Directorate, which is tasked with suppressing internal dissent in the country.

Another local Facebook news page, Tartous Khabr, noted that Mahmoud was married to three wives, one of them, Wafa al-Aasad, a presenter on Syrian television.
The pro-regime news outlets in the coastal region all provided similar accounts of Mahmoud's murder in the small mountain village overlooking Latakia, only disagreeing on whether either Mahmoud's son or son of his nephew was also killed.
All of these pages called the crime “murky” and hesitated to speculate on the perpetrators, however one, the Al-Bahluliyah News Network, complained that the murder took place 25 meters away from a security checkpoint.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights blamed the crime, which it dubbed an “assassination,” on militiamen, citing local sources in the area as saying gunmen loyal to the regime “robbed the house and murdered the retired colonel and his wife and son.”
A pro-rebel outlet also pointed fingers at regime loyalists, saying that residents in Sheikh Hasamo saw a “tinted four-wheel drive vehicle without license plates” stop in front of Mahmoud's villa Tuesday at dawn, around the time of his murder.
The vehicle's presence did not raise suspicions though, because the victim's neighbors were used to the retired intelligence official hosting militiamen in his villa “day and night,” including at loud parties that lasted until the early hours, Zaman al-Wasl reported.
Coastal unaccountability
Mahmoud's murder comes amid mounting lawlessness in Syria's coastal region as pro-regime gunmen take the law into their own hands.
Criminals in Tartous and Latakia have acted with growing impunity, kidnapping residents and stealing cars as complaints over lack of security continue to rise.
In March 16, 2016, Captain Shadi Abib Abbas—a pilot in the Syrian Air Force—was stabbed to death in Tartous in mysterious circumstances, with some blaming local militiamen.
Earlier that the week, a young man was kidnapped in downtown Latakia, sparking anger among residents of the city, which witnessed protests last year after a cousin of President Bashar al-Assad gunned down a Syrian army officer.
Armed militias have even gone as far as fighting security forces around Tartous. In September 2015, members of National Defense Force chief Ahmad al-Houry's militia killed two policemen in a clash in the nearby Alawite town of Dreikish.
The Dreikish incident came weeks after NDF gunmen opened fire on residents of the Tartous town of Safita, which is populated by a nearly equal mix of Greek Orthodox and Alawites approximately 20 kilometers southeast of Tartous.
A pro-regime Facebook page covering news in the town roundly condemned the incident and called for a government crackdown.
“We call on the competent authorities to put an end to this chaos which is increasing day after day,” a post on the pro-regime Safita News Network read.
The outlet demanded that the government “restrict [weapons] to the army and the armed forces alone.”
Only a week before the Saifta shooting, four Christian men were kidnapped from the nearby town Khreibat by unknown gunmen, sparking tension among the town's residents.

Earlier this week, I shot a video on grilling for a new digital magazine being created by Sideways. I did a spatchcocked chicken, grilled asparagus and also sausage, because, after the infrenal boneless skinless chicken breast, it's the most overcooked meat in America, and yet it's rightly beloved here.
In my experience people err because they're afraid of not cooking it enough. So they either cook it over really high heat, overcooking the outside, busting open the sausage, or they kill it with too much moderate heat.
As we move into grilling season, and there's no better way to cook a sausage than over the smoky heat of live coals, I encourage you to grill sausages often. All carnivores around you will be happier.
There are two stages to grilling a sausage to perfection. Start it over moderate direct heat to give it flavor and color. Finish it in a covered grill over indirect heat till it's reached the appropriate internal temperature. Pork sausages should be grilled to 150 degrees F./65 degrees C. Poultry sausage should be cooked to 160 degrees F./70 degrees C. The above sausage is my favorite all-time sausage, chicken with basil tomato and garlic, from Charcuterie, bien sur. As you can see I went a little over on this one! (A few degrees are ok if the sausage is any good.)
So, stop overcooking your sausages! The casing should crack! when you bite down and juices should explode in the mouth.
[About thermometers: I used this Maverick thermometer, available at Open Sky (the company sent it to me to test when Open Sky couldn't source the comparable Thermopen; it's very good, can be used for candy and deep-frying; it tested well for both speed and accuracy; when I told Mike at Open Sky I was posting on sausages, he created a coupon so that we could sell this for less than Amazon does—use the code “Maverick15” at checkout for a 15% discount). You can also use this inexpensive Taylor instant read, works perfectly fine for sausages. Want to grill them tonight? Most hardware stores carry decent instant read thermometers. The point is, own a thermometer, and use it to know exactly when your sausage is done.]

State House Speaker Tom Leonard has called for MSU President Lou Anna Simon to resign, saying state legislators should consider withholding funding to the university during the budgeting process if questions remain about who at MSU knew what and when about Larry Nassar's admitted crimes.
"In light of your failing, it is time for the U.S. Department of Justice, the F.B.I., the Michigan State Police, and the Attorney General to put witnesses under oath, find out who knew what and when, and get to the bottom of what happened," the DeWitt Township Republican wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday aimed at Michigan State University.
"At best, you have clearly proven yourself grossly incompetent. At worst, you are covering something up and shielding bad actors from the justice these victims deserve. It is well past time for all of us to find out the truth."
Leonard said he decided to call for an independent investigation of MSU when he read on Friday that, while MSU has hired law firms to assist with internal reviews, those law firms don't plan on putting together reports on their findings.
"It made my skin crawl," he said on Monday. "It's absolutely reprehensible."
On Monday, Leonard called on Simon to resign amid growing criticism of the university. In an interview with the State Journal, he cited the lack of reports from MSU's outside counsel and the university's handling of a 2014 Title IX investigation into Nassar.
Leonard has been state House Speaker for one year and is running for Michigan Attorney General.
His calls for Simon's resignation and an independent investigation represent his own views and not those of all House Republicans, he said.
Leonard said he's looked into what he could do from his position to address questions about who knew what and when about Nassar. He came to the conclusion that, at this time, due to the separation of powers and the autonomy universities have in the state, it's best handled by an agency that can handle criminal matters.
However, Leonard said, if no independent investigation of MSU is underway when the state budgeting process begins early next year, state legislators should consider withholding some funding as a means of getting questions answered.

MSU spokesman Jason Cody declined to comment but referred to an editorial by the MSU Board of Trustees in response to the State Journal Editorial Board's call for Simon to resign.
"Our full confidence in President Lou Anna K. Simon has not wavered," trustees wrote. "We firmly believe she is the right leader for this university."

In an opinion piece in the State Journal last week, Pat Miles, a former U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Michigan, called for the Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette to investigate MSU.
"Schuette must immediately launch a broad investigation to determine whether anyone else is responsible for the crimes committed against these children and their families," Miles wrote. "Schuette's so-far refusal to investigate is itself cause for concern."
Miles, a Democrat, was the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Michigan when Nassar was indicted on three child pornography charges. He resigned in January and is running for Michigan Attorney General.
Nassar, 54, of Holt, was sentenced last week to 60 years in federal prison for three child pornography charges, which he pleaded guilty to in July.
Last month, Nassar pleaded guilty to 10 first-degree criminal sexual conduct charges split between Ingham and Eaton counties. He faces at decades in prison and will be sentenced in January.
Nassar worked for MSU for decades. Between 1997 and 2015, at least seven women or girls say they raised concerns about his actions to coaches, trainers, police or university officials. He was investigated twice by police but never charged.
In 2014, the university cleared him of sexual assault allegations after a Title IX investigation. Ingham County prosecutors declined to issue charges after an MSU police investigation.
Calls for an independent investigation about who at MSU knew what and when have been ongoing for nearly a year. In February, more than 100 university faculty members called for an outside investigation of Nassar. The university has been paying attorneys, some charging $990 an hour, to represent it in the civil lawsuits related to Nassar or handle internal reviews.
For full coverage of the Larry Nassar cases, go here.
Those calls were renewed as Nassar began to plead guilty in state courts and have now been joined by calls for Simon to resign.
Last month, Cody said the FBI, in conjunction with MSU's own police department, conducted a joint investigation this year focused on "whether any university employee other than Nassar engaged in criminal conduct." He added that the results of that investigation were sent to the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Michigan, and "We have no reason to believe that any criminal conduct was found."

For the past year, Nassar has been in federal custody and held at the Newaygo County Jail pending the resolution of his child pornography charges, which happened last week.
Nassar is now being held at the Ingham Count Jail as he awaits his sentencing on seven first-degree criminal sexual conduct charges. The sentencing starts Jan. 12 and could last more than a day. He'll then be sentenced in Eaton County starting Jan. 31.

More voters would like to see Labour or the Conservatives go into coalition with Ukip than with the Liberal Democrats if there is a hung parliament at the general election, a poll has found.
If neither party wins an overall majority, 29% said the Tories should share power with Nigel Farage's party against 25% who said they should renew their partnership with the Lib Dems.
While 26% of those asked thought Labour should also seek a pact with Ukip rather than Nick Clegg's party (23%), according to the TNS poll.
TNS director Jamie Willard said: "This latest TNS poll shows we are witnessing the edge of politics joining the mainstream; with 57% of those surveyed saying the growth of minority parties is a good thing.
"Indeed, with Ukip now seen as the favoured coalition partner for both Labour and the Conservatives, it suggests that Ukip are drawing support from across the political spectrum."
The survey found more than half of those questioned (53%) would prefer a single-party government than another coalition.
The TNS poll recorded a slump in support for Conservatives, down four points since a similar poll a fortnight ago to 27% - their lowest rating from a mainstream pollster since November.
Labour are up two to lead on 33%, Ukip up two on 18%, Greens up one point on 8% and Liberal Democrats down two on 6%.

example:
Chris Liebing - 7-Eleven
1. Kik Drum Channel
2. Snare Drum Channel
3. Bassline Channel (1)
4. Bassline Channel (2)
5. Synth Line Channel
6. Fx Channel
and so on...
so in essence the complete tune is stripped down to it's single tracks.
on later tracks have the individual hits... kik, snare, crash etc.
also have wet and dry versions.
The point being that you could then excentuate the mix, lengthen it. edit it, remix it, etc
and use the parts in ableton / traktor / final scratch
This could be made viable in a "selling records" way, by selling the cd / dvd at say 10 to 20 times the price.
Serious developers of "Live" mixing / editing would I'm sure pay the money, considering most people Dj and Produce.
Also the piracy would be somewhat less, like the dub culture because the people that bought the cd / dvd would be less inclined to share it... I mean you get what u pay for and it would lead to far more inspiring, far more un cluttered and tuneful sets...
Before you flame... just pause and think about the extent of the possibilities with ableton and VST's... using meloydyne / anaters autotune to switch tune / key of basslines... and on and on... true DJ creativity...
then think back to Grandmaster flash and what he did with 2 record players instead of 1 which helped lead to the last 20 years of Dj'ing...
let's move things forward...
These quotes by Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood, reveal the wicked roots of the abortion movement and expose the twisted mindset behind the present-day Culture of Death. In her own words, Sanger peddles racism, eugenics, contraception, abortion, while demonstrating a visceral hatred for children, parenthood, marriage and the Catholic Church.
If you want to open more eyes to the truth, please share these quotes far and wide. Only when the abortion agenda is fully rejected in our culture will America be ready to turn back to God.

Congressman Hal Rogers (R.-Ky.) represents the whitest Congressional district in the nation. (Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post)
Writing in the Brookings Institution's FixGov blog last week, political scientist Christopher Parker pondered House Republicans' stubborn refusal to back immigration reform, despite support in the Senate and across wide swaths of the conservative commentariat. He surmises that House Republicans are balking because they "represent constituencies haunted by anxiety associated with the perception that they're 'losing their country' to immigrants from south of the border."
Recent polling backs this up. Significant numbers of conservatives, and white Americans in general, admit to feeling discomfort at the prospect of a non-majority white America. These views are even stronger among Tea Party-aligned conservatives. According to Parker's polling, nearly two-thirds of Tea Party conservatives want to eliminate birthright citizenship, and 82 percent of Tea Partiers say they feel "anxious or fearful" about undocumented immigrants.
Another factor behind Republican recalcitrance on immigration and similar issues is the simple racial math underlying many House congressional districts. According to U.S. Census data, only 13 out of 234 Republican-held districts are majority-minority (that is, districts where white non-Hispanics make up less than 50 percent of the population). That's about 5 percent of all Republican districts. In contrast, fully 49 percent of Democrat-held districts are majority-minority.
You can see how this looks in the chart below, which plots one thin bar for every congressional district in the U.S., sorted by the white non-Hispanic share of the district population, and colored according to whether a Democrat or Republican holds the seat.
On the left side of the chart are districts with the lowest white non-Hispanic population share. These districts are overwhelmingly Democratic. The least-white district in the United States is New York's 15th, which lies within the Bronx and is held by Democrat Jose Serrano. In terms of ranking by non-white population share a Republican district doesn't show up until number 21 on the list - that would be Florida's 27th, a majority Hispanic district with a large Cuban population, held by Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.

Republicans, on the other hand, are better represented on the right side of the chart. The whitest district in the nation (at 96.2%) is Kentucky's 5th, represented by Republican Hal Rogers. There are a fair number of Democrat-held districts over here too - seats in highly liberal but overwhelmingly white New England states like Maine and Vermont, as well as some seats in West Virginia and the Northern Great Lakes region.

Separately charting the distribution of Democratic and Republican seats yields an even clearer picture of the racial divide between the parties. The charts below show the number of seats by each district's white population at 10 percent intervals.
The Republican distribution is highly skewed toward seats with strong white majorities. About two-thirds of Republican House seats are in districts where the population is more than 70 percent white. The Democratic seats, on the other hand, are surprisingly balanced, with similar numbers seen on both sides of the distribution. Less than three-in-ten Democratic seats are in districts where whites make up more than 70 percent of the population.
These numbers neatly illustrate why House Republicans can afford to balk on immigration reform, and to talk about things like a "war on whites:" in general, there's very little disincentive for doing so. A sizeable majority of the House Republican caucus simply doesn't need to worry about appealing to minority voters, period.
Things are different in the Senate, where statewide races force politicians to appeal to more heterogeneous audiences, both in terms of ideology and race. For a sense of this, we can zoom out to the national level and look at racial breakdown of all constituents represented by Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate.
Whites make up a little more than 50 percent of the total population of all House districts represented by Democrats. But whites represent 75 percent of all Republican House constituents. Party constituent populations in the Senate, on the other hand, are considerably more balanced. Whites make up 63 percent of all Democratic constituents, and 65 percent of all Republican constituents.
In the House in particular, Democrats and Republicans represent populations that are racially quite different. They are quite literally playing to two very different audiences when it comes to race.
Moreover, House Republicans' constituents are considerably whiter than even Senate Republicans' constituents. Conversely, House Democrats represent a less white coalition of voters than their counterparts in the Senate. These differences partly explain not only the vast ideological gulf between House Democrats and Republicans, but also the frequently fractious relationship between Republicans in the House and Senate.
CHIHUAHUA, CHIHUAHUA
Un total de 26 estadunidenses integrantes de una secta religiosa que abusaba de menores de edad, fueron arrestados en el municipio de Cuauhtémoc, Chihuahua, donde se ocultaban en un campo menonita.
El arresto se dio mediante un operativo binacional, con agentes de Estados Unidos y México, en un rancho ubicado en el Campo 8 de la colonia Manitoba, en el municipio de Cuauhtémoc.
Entre los detenidos, se encuentra Orson William Black Jr, líder de la secta, el cual era buscado por el FBI como presunto responsable del delito de pedofilia, junto con otras 25 personas, todas estadunidenses.
Black Jr, era líder fundamentalista mormón, de la Iglesia de los Santos de los últimos días, y se declaraba profeta por tener contacto directo con Dios, con lo cual atraía a adolescentes y menores de edad para abusar sexualmente de ellas
El operativo fue confirmado por autoridades locales del estado de Chihuahua, quienes no dieron más detalles sobre el número de agentes y de que agencias policiacas estadounidenses participaron en el operativo, pero por parte de Chihuahua, fueron cerca de un centenar de agentes estatales quienes apoyaron en las labores de arresto binacional.
La secta se reunía en el rancho El Negro, donde el pasado 10 de septiembre tres ciudadanos estadunidenses, entre ellos un menor de 15 años, fueron asesinados a balazos.
De acuerdo con fichas del FBI, Black Jr, era líder fundamentalista mormón, de la Iglesia de los Santos de los últimos días, y se declaraba profeta por tener contacto directo con Dios, con lo cual atraía a adolescentes y menores de edad para abusar sexualmente de ellas y posteriormente convertirlas en sus esposas.
LA ficha del FBI señala que el grupo vivía en México, específicamente en Chihuahua, y que Black era un fugitivo en los Estados Unidos, buscado por la policía por conspiración y conductas sexuales inapropiadas con menores de edad.
Extraoficialmente se indicó que en el operativo participaron agentes del Buró Federal de Investigaciones (FBI, por sus siglas en inglés), apoyados por agentes mexicanos del estado de Chihuahua.
Durante la acción policial, se aseguraron trece camionetas, motocicletas, vehículos "razor", animales disecados, entre otros no revelados hasta el momento.
No se indicó si en el operativo se aseguró a menores de edad.
Imagine being stuck in a Kafkaesque nightmare like the one my pal Eric Ward faces:
I'm African-American and my family moved to California almost a hundred years ago after a lynching took place outside their hometown in Kentucky. I'm also undocumented, or in the current anti-immigrant vernacular, “illegal.” I don't have the necessary documents to prove my identity. Therefore, within four years, I won't be able to vote, have access to social services, or receive state identification to travel.
How did this happen? Well, it all began when Ward — who has a visual disability, so he does not carry a driver's license — lost his passport and Social Security card in an airport mishap. To replace them, he found he needed a copy of his birth certificate. After much wrangling, he finally obtained it. But that was just the beginning:
A few days later I headed to the Social Security Administration to obtain a replacement social security card. But when I got there, the Social Security Administration said I needed more than just a copy of my birth certificate. They said I also needed a passport, driver's license, or state identification card to prove my identity. But since I went to the Social Security Administration to obtain a new copy of my social security card so I could get a new passport, the Social Security Administration didn't know what to do with me. So, they told me to head across town to the Illinois Secretary of State's office to get my social security card. But when I arrived, the Illinois Secretary of State's office said I needed my social security card to obtain any official document to prove my identity. Now I'm stuck in a Catch-22 and I'm not alone in this predicament. Almost nine percent of African Americans (18 or older) are unable to document their citizenship. * Roughly 2 million African Americans, eleven million native born citizens, and nearly twice as many low income Americans than citizens with higher incomes don't have a social security card, driver's licenses, passport, birth certificate or proof of naturalization. *
As Swati Pandi at the LA Times blog observes, this all boils down to a simple formula: "Want to prove who you are? Get a birth certificate. Want to get a birth certificate? Prove who you are."
It's not just African Americans who are being swept up in this hysteria, and it isn't just this misbegotten measure that is victimizing ordinary American citizens. You can also include Native Americans and senior citizens among those whose status as voting citizens is now considered dubious:
Bernice Todd's Choctaw family roots are sunk deep in the soil of Oklahoma, a state whose very name is Choctaw for "red people." But in the middle of a debilitating battle with cancer, Todd, a 39-year-old who cleans homes at a trailer park and baby-sits for a living, lost her state Medicaid health care coverage because, although she's a Native American, she could not prove she is a U.S. citizen. While Todd's case is rich in irony, she is one of tens of thousands of Americans who are falling victim to a new federal rule—aimed at keeping illegal immigrants off the Medicaid rolls—requiring that recipients prove their citizenship and identity with documents many don't have.
… States have always been required to check a Medicaid applicant's eligibility, which includes citizenship. But a July 2006 rule, enforced by the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), now demands specific documents as proof, such as a passport or a birth certificate, driver's license or military record. States face fines if they don't comply.
The rule, which neither CMS nor the Bush administration requested, was adopted by the Republican-dominated Congress in 2005 despite the fact that there was no evidence that undocumented immigrants were falsely claiming U.S. citizenship to get Medicaid. "This rule was the answer to a problem that really doesn't exist," says Donna Cohen Ross, an analyst with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, a nonpartisan research organization.
That pretty much describes the nativist approach to immigration in general. And in the process of fixing something by making it worse, they're conveniently disenfranchising thousands, perhaps millions, of American citizens, stripping them of their rights as citizens.
I happen to be one of those old-fashioned curmudgeons who believes that citizenship is a sacred part of how a democratic republic functions, and that taking away those rights is not what government should be in the business of doing. But maybe that's just me.
Understanding & Predicting Length of Stay (LOS) using Machine Learning
Length of Stay (LOS) is perhaps one of the most closely watched metrics in inpatient Hospital settings. From Wikipedia on what LOS means:
A common statistic associated with length of stay is the average length of stay (ALOS), a mean calculated by dividing the sum of inpatient days by the number of patients admissions with the same diagnosis-related group classification. Length of stay (LOS) is a term to describe the duration of a single episode of hospitalization. Inpatient days are calculated by subtracting day of admission from day of discharge.
LOS is a big focus area for Insurance companies & hospitals. For example, Medicare, through its Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPCI) Initiative, aims to pay a flat fee for a single type of surgery such as Knee Replacement. In that scenario, Hospitals are extremely motivated to reduce the LOS for a single surgery since that reduces the costs of the Hospital while keeping the same fee payment. Given that context, predictive capabilities around LOS are an extremely important area for innovation.
Dexur analyzes large scale medical claims data sets to identify LOS by discharge & diagnoses area for all hospitals. We have created a large and enriched LOS data set based on claims for all hospitals to aid in the development of machine learning models. If you are a healthcare researcher & want access to these data sets, please contact us & we can collaborate on a project. A simple chart based on the data set showing the top Discharge Groups by LoS at Mayo Clinic at Rochester is given below & the details can be seen here.
In addition, we have also shared 5 Machine Learning studies that try to predict & understand LOS in Hospitals:

The world's commercial shipping fleet, already struggling with the cost of meeting environmental regulations, may be sitting on an even bigger time bomb. Analysis of hull anti-fouling coatings suggests they could be shedding a hitherto unsuspected one million tons of biocides into the oceans every year.
Anti-fouling coatings are intended to prevent the growth of slime, weeds and crustaceans on ship hulls. By nature they have to be toxic to marine life. However the coatings only last for a few years before becoming depleted through water abrasion, underwater cleaning and intentional ablative wear (termed “self-polishing” by the manufacturers). The biocidal constituents of the anti-fouling coatings are often long-lasting, and have nowhere to go but into the sea-bed where they accumulate in sediment and then marine flora and fauna.
Clean hulls travel more quickly through the water and need less fuel, so anti-fouling coatings are popular with ship operators. The biocides they contain have to be strong if they are to kill the notoriously tenacious marine growths, and operators generally want paint manufacturers to use the strongest biocides the law allows. The volume of biocides entering the oceans as a result has so far escaped broad attention.
The practice of underwater cleaning of ship hulls, in particular, releases point concentrations of an estimated two tons of toxic coating per cleaning. Such cleaning is banned by most ports, which has the effect of concentrating it in areas that are less scrupulous about environmental protection. Gibraltar and Algeciras, Piraeus, Singapore and some Turkish and Middle Eastern ports are known to have a laissez-faire attitude to cleaning operations, but there are also reports of cleaning being allowed in Britain's Torbay, a popular holiday destination.
Underwater cleaning operations, to be effective, involve aggressive brushing by diver-controlled carts. In practice, they remove not just biofouling, but layers of anti-fouling chemicals and the epoxy paints beneath them. Because the material removed by cleaning is immediately lost to the water, the volume of biocides entering the marine environment is effectively impossible to measure. But information from industry sources at a recent event in Rotterdam gives an indication that the volume is far higher than previously thought.
Maersk Line, the giant of the commercial shipping world, are notoriously reticent about their operational and environmental practices. However, a former executive revealed at the Rotterdam event that it was accepted within the company that a single underwater cleaning operation will remove around one third of the thickness of anti-fouling paint on a ship hull. The cost of frequent repainting, he said, was considered to be a small price to pay for the fuel savings resulting from cleaner hulls. The company's ships have frequently been observed undergoing underwater cleaning in the bay of Algeciras/Gibraltar and elsewhere.
But given that an average sized cargo vessel might be carrying as much as 10 tons of anti-fouling paint, the scale of biocidal pollution into the oceans becomes alarming. On these figures, around 3 tons of anti-fouling paint would be removed at each cleaning. Depending on their trading patterns, ships owned by operators who favour frequent cleaning might undertake the operation between once and four times a year.
Maersk Line's practices tend to influence decisions by other operators who are trying to remain competitive with the Danish giant. By itself it operates some 750 container ships worldwide and favours anti-fouling paints over more environmentally friendly alternatives. If cleaned once a year, that number of ships might be releasing more than 2,000 tons of biocides into the oceans a year. For the world commercial fleet of 58,000 ships the figure becomes well over one million tons per year. Navies and yachts take the volume even higher.
According to the former Maersk staffer, the company's anti-fouling policy had been set by the now deceased owner Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller, who is reputed to have maintained a patriarchal hold over the family business until his death in 2012. The policy, according to the staffer, was to use the strongest anti-fouling possible and reapply it often. Maersk certainly sent shock waves through the industry five years ago when it became known they were paying shipyards to remove coatings considered more environmentally friendly and replace them with older-style biocides.
Heavy metals
Today's anti-fouling coatings generally rely on copper compounds for their effectiveness, but ‘booster' biocides are added, some of which are banned or heavily restricted for use on land. The copper content of anti-fouling paint is generally between 50 and 70%. Even so, copper anti-foulings are thought of as a second-best option by operators, since they are less effective and wear out more quickly than the now-banned Tributyl tin coatings. Tin was banned on ships in 2008 following the discovery of its effects on key species of marine flora and fauna.
Copper anti-fouling is often defended by paint manufacturers on the basis that the metal occurs naturally in the marine environment. However the quantities of copper which can accumulate around busy shipping lanes through ablation, and as a result of cleaning operations, is far beyond naturally occurring levels. A 2008 study reported in the China Science Bulletin determined there were serious effects from the copper and zinc (also used in anti-fouling) accumulating on the sea bed:
“Some samples of seashell animals stuck and multiplied on the bottom (beneath the seawater) coated with antifouling paints were collected at some domestic maritime spaces, and the content of heavy metals was detected through Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectroscopy. Meanwhile, comparison with seashell animals was made on market for edible use. It shows that the content of heavy metals in internal organs of these marine animals is very high due to the large amount of copper and zinc contained in the antifouling paints, and this also does severely harm to sea environment and ecology. To study and develop the novel antifouling paints without copper(I) oxide is an imperative task which brooks no delay.”

A diving unit with the Nova Scotia RCMP is searching a pond in Lower Truro in connection with the death of Dalhousie University student Taylor Samson.
Halifax Regional Police say they've found evidence connected to Samson's murder at the property they've been searching since Tuesday. Police won't say what the items are, or how they're connected to the case.

"Last night we had a development in that searchers in the area found several items of potential interest to our investigation," said Theresa Rath, a spokesperson for the Halifax Regional Police.
"Based on their preliminary analysis, they do believe that the items may be connected to the Taylor Samson homicide."
Forensic identification officers are at the scene and took the items for analysis.
Police continue to search the site. Rath said there were eight search teams at the site on Thursday and more are expected today. An RCMP underwater recovery team has joined them to search a nearby pond.
Rath said police expect to be on the property — which includes a marsh, rolling hills and a corn field — for another several days and throughout the weekend at least.
According to a neighbour, part of the area being searched belongs to the family of the man accused of killing Samson.
Samson's body has not been found.

William Michael Sandeson, a 22-year-old fellow Dalhousie University kinesiology student and track athlete from Lower Truro, is charged with first-degree murder in Samson's death. Sandeson was about to start his first year of medical school.
Police suspect victim was involved in drug deal
According to a warrant filed in Halifax provincial court, police had "reasonable grounds" to believe there was marijuana in Samson's apartment.
Samson, who was from Amherst, was last seen on Aug. 15 at the Sigma Chi fraternity house to which he belonged, on South Street in Halifax.
Samson's girlfriend told police he left the apartment the night he disappeared with a black duffel bag, containing what she believed was marijuana.
She told police when he left, he only took his phone and left behind his wallet and keys, as well as medication for a liver disorder. He told her he would "only be gone for 15 minutes," according to court documents.
Further investigation led police to search a home in the 1200 block of Henry Street in Halifax. Court documents list Sandeson's address as 1210 Henry St. and police say they believe that's where Samson was murdered. It's around the corner from the fraternity house.
The court documents do not say how police linked Samson's disappearance to the suspected murder scene on Henry Street.
BARRE, Vt. (AP) — The woman charged in the slaying of a Vermont social worker is also "the alleged perpetrator" of the deaths of three relatives whose bodies were found Saturday, Gov. Peter Shumlin said.
The three women found dead at a Berlin home Saturday morning were an aunt and two cousins of 40-year-old Jody Herring, the governor said at a news conference Saturday night after returning from vacation in Nova Scotia upon hearing of the deaths. Herring was arrested on a murder charge in the death of Lara Sobel.
Sobel was gunned down after work Friday outside a state office building in Barre. She handled a case for the state Department for Children and Families in which Herring lost custody of her 9-year-old daughter, authorities said.
Herring was in custody, pending an arraignment Monday. It wasn't clear if she had a lawyer who could comment on her behalf.
"I think all Vermonters are as shocked, dismayed, horrified and grief-stricken as all of us are," Shumlin said. "I cannot remember, in my lifetime, four people being murdered by the same alleged perpetrator."
Shumlin tentatively identified the three victims found Saturday as Rhonda Herring and Regina Herring, the suspect's cousins; and Julianne Falzarano, an aunt. Autopsies will be conducted. The cousins were in their 40s, and the aunt in her 70s, he said.
Shumlin said the three were killed before Sobel's life was taken. Police received a 911 call to the Berlin home Saturday, he said.
The governor said the investigation into the deaths of Herring's relatives was ongoing and he declined to release any additional information. Police said at least two of the women appeared to have been shot.
Authorities said Friday night that Sobel had just left a DCF office on Friday afternoon when she was shot twice. The child remains in state custody, officials said.
Sobel's family released a statement on Saturday thanking the community for its kindness during their ordeal and asked others to respect their privacy.
The family said that it hopes that the tragedy "can create awareness of the dedicated professionals who devote so much of their energy to ensuring the welfare of children."
Lt. Gov. Phil Scott said he knew several members of the extended Herring family.
"It's my understanding after speaking with some of her (Jody Herring's) relatives that her father was one of 16 brothers and sisters. It's a large, extended family throughout central Vermont," Scott said.
Ken Schatz, the commissioner for the Department for Children and Families, called Sobel's shooting "a heartbreaking tragedy." He called Sobel "an experienced social worker. She had been providing public service for children and families for more than 14 years."
Vermont's child protection agency, like those in many other states, frequently comes under criticism from parents for being too quick to remove children from homes in cases of alleged abuse and neglect; and from the public when children are left in the home and end up dying at the hands of family members.
A special legislative committee was set up to investigate the department system after the deaths last year of two toddlers who had been involved with DCF. Following the investigation, Vermont passed a new law designed to improve communications between the department, law enforcement and the courts.

An antenna is a simple device, an assembly of metal rods that turns electromagnetic waves into electrical currents. They come in various sizes and styles because the length of the rods are designed to catch particular frequencies.
“The bigger the antenna, the more bars, the better at receiving a weaker signal,” said Dave Wilson, director of technology and standards for the Consumer Electronics Association. “The main reason for most of the different shapes is that many times you want the antenna to not just convert the electrical field, but to amplify a weak signal, or ignore an interfering signal.”
For a simple device, the antenna has generated a lot of misinformation. For example, you may hear about digital antenna or HDTV antenna. But you do not need an HDTV antenna to get digital high-definition signals. Digital HD is broadcast on the same UHF and VHF frequencies as analog TV. The antennas need not be different. A special antenna is not required to receive the new channels from a station. If your antenna gets the local PBS channel, for example, it will get all the digital subchannels.
For those locations suffering the cliff effect, a new antenna is needed to pull the signals in. For TV reception on UHF and VHF frequencies, an indoor antenna like rabbit ears may work if the signal is very strong. A weaker signal may require a disc-shaped outdoor antenna that receives signals from all directions. An even weaker signal will require a V-shaped outdoor antenna, perhaps with a motor to point it directly at each broadcast signal tower.
Before buying an antenna, buy the converter box and attach it to your old antenna and to your TV. You may get all of the stations you want. (The boxes are available at electronics stores. You can get a coupon for a $40 discount at dtv2009.gov, but don't wait too long; there is a limited supply of them.)

As Mr. Duffy found, picking the right antenna can require some experimentation. After the rabbit ears, he tried different receivers and antennas in different locations. He graduated from a $25 indoor antenna that didn't solve the problem to a $30 outdoor antenna with a 40-inch boom mounted on the garage.
Reception is now good, he said, but not perfect, which has him thinking about a rotating antenna or a signal amplifier. The Consumer Electronics Association and the National Association of Broadcasters sponsor a Web site to help people through the process, antennaweb.org. The site uses software that determines which aerial you need based on your location relative to station antennas. It also advises you where to point it.

The site organizes types of antenna by a color code, from yellow for low-strength multidirectional antennas to violet for large directional antennas that may also need an amplifier to pull in weak signals. The electronics association is encouraging antenna makers to use the color code as a guide on their packaging.
It is easier finding the right spot for an antenna. “The best placement is outside on a mast as high up as possible,” said Mr. Wilson. Make sure the antenna is properly grounded. (Another suggestion: make the switch before the February changeover; it is not good to walk on an icy roof.)
Not a do-it-yourselfer? Antennaweb links to techhome.com, which can locate an installer in your area. But buyer beware, though the installers are on the association Web site, they aren't required to be certified, bonded or experienced to get on the list.
If the available antenna placement is less than perfect, sometimes a signal amplifier can boost a signal sufficiently to make up the difference. An amplifier, which sells for about $60, is also useful if the cable connecting the TV and the antenna is longer than 20 feet, or if more than one TV is using the same antenna through a splitter, which weakens the signal.
But you can get too much of a good thing. “More signal is not always helpful. It is possible to overload the receiver with signal so it won't work,” Mr. Wilson said. Also make sure the amplifier boosts the specific frequency range you want amplified, he said.
Some homeowner associations may have restrictions against rooftop antennas, but if the neighbors object you can quote Section 207 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The act broadly says that no one can keep an owner or renter from the “installation, maintenance or use” of an antenna. In rare cases, the kind of antenna and where it is placed may be restricted.
If the neighbors never talk to you again, be content that at least you'll have your TV with its bright and clear digital signal — whether you stay in your chair or not.

A stock photo that police put out of the type of vehicle that a Washington homicide suspect was last seen driving: a gold four-door 2001 Ford Focus.
(Portland Police Bureau)
Portland police were involved in a high-speed chase of a Washington murder suspect early Wednesday, but pulled back after the suspect started swerving into traffic on Southwest Barbur Boulevard, they said.
About 1:15 a.m., Central Precinct officers spotted the suspect's car, a gold 2001 four-door Ford Focus, at Southeast Ninth Avenue and Powell Boulevard.
David Kalac, wanted on a murder allegation in Kitsap County
Police had received information that the car was tied to David Kalac, 33, who is wanted in connection with a homicide Tuesday in Washington's Kitsap County.
The car belonged to Kalac's alleged victim, Amber Lynn Schraw, 30, who was found dead in her Port Orchard, Wash., home after Kalac allegedly posted photos of her strangled body on the imageboard 4chan.
Portland officers tried to do a traffic stop of the car but the driver sped off.
Police chased it across the Ross Island Bridge and south on Barbur Boulevard until a sergeant stopped the pursuit about Southwest 30th Avenue because the car was swerving into oncoming traffic.
The car was last seen speeding south on Barbur Boulevard passing Taylors Ferry Road.
"Based on the available information, officers believe the homicide suspect was driving the vehicle,'' bureau spokesman Sgt. Pete Simpson said in a news release.
Kalac is described as a 6-feet-2-inches tall, 220 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes. Kitsap County has a warrant for his arrest on an allegation of second-degree murder.
The suspect vehicle is a gold 2001 Ford Focus 4-door, with Washington plates 495-YLY.
Kalac is believed to be armed and dangerous, police said.
Police say anyone who sees the car or Kalac shouldn't approach him, but to immediately call 911.

Forge World Preview: Varagyr Terminators
The Space Wolves in the 31st Millennium are about to receive reinforcements in the form of the Varagyr Terminators – elite guard of the Primarch Leman Russ. If you've got your copy of The Horus Heresy VII: Inferno, you'll already have your rules for these guys, and soon, you'll be able to represent them on the tabletop with some awesome models.
Clad in heavy Cataphractii-pattern Terminator armour, the Varagyr Wolf Guard are styled after the rest of their Legion with runes and furs embellishing their war-plate. In addition to being great for battles in the 31st Millennium, we think these models would look right at home in the 41st Millennium as squad leaders and characters in a Space Wolves army.
You'll be able to get your hands on the Varagyr soon; in the meantime, you can browse the range of Forge World's Horus Heresy kits here.
Flickering torches lit the path up to the villa. The guests were led through a modernistic gate, past a glass-covered swimming pool and on to a series of minimalist bungalows, the facades of which were freshly clad in Siberian larch. Champagne was served out of Magnum bottles. A Flamenco band had been brought in from Spain. Wolfgang Beltracchi, the owner of the property, stood in front of his studio welcoming the guests as they arrived, long blond hair hanging down to his shoulders.
Beltracchi's villa is situated in the hills above Freiburg among the city's high society: professors, lawyers and managing directors. Beltracchi and his wife Helene paid 1.1 million for their property and are said to have invested another 4 million remodeling it. The Beltracchis appeared in Freiburg seemingly out of nowhere, without a past or a present. But the money had to have come from somewhere -- and there was gossip. Some said Beltracchi was an artist who only painted for millionaires who regularly commissioned his services. Some thought he was a successful art dealer or the owner of a valuable collection. Others, like a relatively famous plastic surgeon in Freiburg, insisted Beltracchi toured flea markets, where he had found a number of undiscovered masterpieces.
Such was the mood at the party held at the Beltracchis' new house on September 22, 2007.
Just three years later, at 7:35 p.m. on Aug. 27, 2010, police officers detained the Beltracchis not far from their villa as the couple was going out to dinner. The officers had been sent by the district attorney's office in Cologne, which also had a theory about how Wolfgang and Helene Beltracchi had amassed their fortune. It can be found in file number 117 Js 407/10, and if they are confirmed in a court of law, the Beltracchis will officially become the main characters in one of Germany's greatest ever art-forgery scandals.
Alleged Forgeries of 35 Paintings
Since their arrest, the couple has been held in pre-trial detention. They stand accused of organized professional fraud. Prosecutors are also investigating Jeanette S., the sister of Helene Beltracchi, who is also currently in pre-trial detention, as well as the two women's mother and an art dealer from Krefeld identified only as Otto. Lawyers representing the defendants are refusing to comment on the allegations.
The case centers on the alleged forgery of at least 35 paintings dating back to the first decades of the 20th century. The defendants are accused of systematically supplying the art market with paintings they claimed were undiscovered works by famous painters, and this over a period of more than 14 years. These pictures were sold not only through auction houses in Germany, but also ended up in the art world via traders in London and Paris. The investigators estimate the total damage at more than 15 million. Gallery owners, auctioneers and art historians alike now worry the case could become what the fake so-called "Hitler diaries" were for Stern magazine: A fiasco.
The market for 20th century classics is booming at the moment. In May a second painting was sold for more than $100 million at auction. An anonymous bidder paid the equivalent of 81 million for a Picasso nude at Christie's in New York. There's plenty of money to be earned on art, and the competition to find new goods in a limited market is extremely tough. It could be that auction houses are asking too few questions out of fear the would-be seller will take his business elsewhere. Likewise, experts naturally prefer to attest that a picture is genuine rather than voicing suspicions of forgery and thereby potentially ruining their clients' business. Added to this, the art market has always been a somewhat shady operation in which money is passed under the table and art-loving rich people often seek to keep their identities hidden. All this plays into the forgers' hands.
Two Mysterious Art Collections
In the present case, only one of the paintings has been confirmed beyond a doubt by two analyses as being fake. But the investigators are also considering at least 34 others, all of which have a number of similarities: They are all in similar frames and have yellowed stickers from famous galleries on their backs. No photographs exist of any of them. Many had been considered lost. And all allegedly come from two mysterious art collections.
One of these collections is said to have belonged to a businessman from Cologne called Werner Jägers, the grandfather of the two sisters awaiting trial. According to a letter Helene Beltracchi sent to an art historian, Jägers had acquired a number of paintings in the "late 1920s and early 1930s," particularly works by Rhenish expressionists artists "like Campendonk, Pechstein, Nauen, Mense, Ernst" as well as French painters "like Braque, Derain, Dufy, Marcoussis." She claimed several "important works in his collection" had been bought from the Jewish art dealer Alfred Flechtheim, "who owned display rooms near one of her grandfather's business premises" and had been a "good friend" of Werner Jägers. When the Nazis came to power, Jägers was allegedly loath to give up his precious artworks -- officially derided as "degenerate" during the Third Reich -- so he hid the pictures at a property in the Eiffel region of Germany. "A few years before his death," Beltracchi claims, he had passed on "a part of his collection" to her and her sister.
One aspect of her story is certainly correct: Her grandfather really existed.
Werner Jägers was born in Belgium in 1912. He married four times and lived mainly in Cologne, where he subsequently died in 1992. But the entrepreneur who made most of his money with industrial construction had relatively little interest in art. Both a close business associate and Jägers' last wife have confirmed he did no more than paint in his spare time -- and only originals like small calendar pictures and fruit baskets.
Hardly a Collection
Neither the man's widow nor his business partner have any memory of an art collection. Although Jägers purchased a few paintings, these were definitely not valuable and certainly did not constitute a collection. Nor are there any records that suggest Jägers, a member of the German Nazi Party, ever knew the Jewish art dealer Alfred Flechtheim.
There is, however, ample evidence that the key to the mystery of the artworks lies with his granddaughter from his first marriage. When Jägers died, in 1992, Helene Beltracchi was 34 years old and had recently started dealing in antiques. The young, attractive blonde ran an antiques store in Cologne. As the daughter of a Belgian trucker, she and her four sisters grew up in a public housing apartment in Bergisch Gladbach. Helene studied business before diving into the world of junkshop owners, collectors and antique-lovers.
It was probably here that Helene Beltracchi's world intersected with that of her future husband, Wolfgang. At the time, his surname was still Fischer, and he was trying his hand as an artist. In 1978, the Haus der Kunst museum in Munich exhibited three of his acrylic-on-canvas works. They were entitled "Zu Hause" (At Home), "Durchdringung bei Geilenkirchen" (Penetration Near Geilenkirchen) and "Durchdringung, Melatenerstr. Nr. 4" (Penetration, Melatener Street, No. 4). Perhaps the young artist had already realized how difficult it was to earn his keep with conventional art.
In 1997 Mel Waters called into Coast2Coast AM to talk about a giant hole he found on his property. And this page is going to discuss Mel's gaping hole, but first....
===Did you know it rains frogs in some places? Just right out of the sky! I'm telling you, it's the damnedest thing. But getting back to what we're all here for, Mel's Hole. This hole has mystical properties that can bring dogs back to life and even burn ice!===
But not only that, Brazil nuts sometimes also rain from the sky. These nuts are quiet as they fall, unlike the screaming sounds a cat would make if you threw a live one down Mel's Hole. Mel's hole is deep. He's tossed dead cows and refrigerators down there
I saw a hole on the TV once, on the Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, I think it was. This was back in olden times when fellas rode horses. Mel lowered thousands of miles of fishing line into his hole and dogs won't go near it.
Eventually the military seizes Mel's hole and pays him 8 million dollars to abandon his hole and raise wombats in the Australian outback. The wombats sucked Mel dry of the 8 million and he ended up on a bus where he got in a fight and lost his teeth.
Mel got new teeth and met some Native Americans who had their own weird hole. Their hole had a beam of darkness shooting out of it, so naturally they beat a sheep unconscious and lowered it 1500 feet into the hole. Mel is not a sheep guy, but Mel can pick up a sheep.
When they got the sheep back out of the hole, it had been cooked and a kind-eyed seal creature emerged from a tumor inside the sheep. The creature looked compassionately at Mel for about 2 solid hours before nodding and leaping back into the Native American hole.
But did I say it was Brazil nuts? I'm not sure if it makes a difference.
Lord Hill has come under fire from a former Conservative Cabinet colleague after he said there was an “extraordinarily strong case” for Britain to remain part of the European Union.
Owen Paterson, the former Environment Secretary, said Lord Hill had to be “careful not to mislead the British people” when he argued that Britain gained economically from its membership.
The peer, who was appointed by David Cameron in 2014 as the UK's European Commissioner, said yesterday Britain's strategic interests could suffer if it decided to leave the EU in the upcoming referendum, which has been promised before the end of 2017.

He told The World This Weekend: “It's true in politics, as in life, that you can't have your cake and eat it. You can't have easy access to the single market, you can't be part of free trade negotiations, you can't be part of an effective European diplomacy without being a full member of it.”
But Mr Paterson, who served in the same Cabinet team as Lord Hill during the last parliament, said the commissioner was “wrong” and that Britain could still enjoy the economic benefits without being a full member.
“All members of the establishment have got to be careful not to mislead the British people and we are seeing increasingly a misleading narrative going out that it's the EU that delivers the three million jobs which have been talked about, delivers prosperity,” Mr Paterson told BBC Radio 4's World at One.
“The EU is not synonymous with the market... it's the market that delivers the jobs and prosperity. And there is this caricature being put about that should we leave the current political and judicial arrangements we leap into some crazy economic black abyss.”
Leaving the EU, the Tory MP added, would help Britain to “regalvanise” the single market and cooperation with the Anglosphere.
The row comes ahead of David Cameron kicking off a diplomatic push to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the European Union.

Cate Blanchett was invited to speak at Gough Whitlam's memorial service at Sydney Town Hall earlier today. If the thinking was that she'd be a harmless, crowd-pleasing celebrity guest, old m8 Cate didn't get the memo; she came out swinging but good. Right off the bat, she highlighted free education and healthcare as two of the things she wouldn't have succeeded without, which most of the crowd loved and made for some pretty fantastic shots of various government ministers looking deeply unimpressed.
Here are some highlights from her intro:
“When I heard that Gough Whitlam had died, I was filled with an inordinate sadness, a great sorrow.
“The loss I felt came down to something very deep and very simple: I am the beneficiary of free tertiary education.
“When I went to university, I could explore different courses and engage with the student union in extra-curricular activities. It was through that that I discovered acting.
“I am the beneficiary of good, free healthcare that meant that the little I earned after tax and rent could go towards seeing shows, bands, and living inside my generation's expression.
“I am the product of an Australia that engages with the globe, and engages honestly with its history and its Indigenous peoples.
“I am a small part of Australia's coming of age, and so many of those initiatives were enacted when I was three.
Tony Abbott's whole row just kind of sat awkwardly during that bit while everyone else clapped. It was great.
Here's how George Brandis looked during that bit about little healthcare bit, incidentally. He's next to Bill Shorten, for some bizarre reason:
Here are some other highlights from Blanchett's speech, which was pretty killer all round:
“Speaking of exhausting, I am a working mother of three, and when I took on the role in Little Fish [in 2004] I had just my second child. no one batted an eyelid. No one passed judgment and no one deemed me incapable because the culture around women, and the right of women to work as equals in Australia had also been addressed significantly by Gough Whitlam.
“Before 1973, only widows were entitled to pensions, and thus the new benefit created choice for single mothers in how they raised their children, and began combating some of the stigmas surrounding single motherhood itself.
“He established the Family Court, a cornerstone reform, and in the Family Law Act of 1975, he made the space for fault-free divorce, which allowed women to exit from abusive relationships and re-engage with society with dignity and with equality.
“But there is so much to say, even from my own, small, tiny, irrelevant experience, that what I would actually love to do at this memorial is pretend to be Gough Whitlam for a minute. Don't worry, I'm not going to imitate him. No-one could.
“He said of his government: ‘In any civilised community the arts and associated amenities must occupy a central place. Their enjoyment should not be seen as remote from everyday life. Of all the objectives of my government, none had a higher priority than the encouragement of the arts; the preservation and enrichment of our cultural and intellectual heritage. Indeed, I would argue that all other objectives of a Labor government — social reform, justice and equity in the provision of welfare services and educational opportunities — have as their goal the creation of a society in which the arts and the appreciation of spiritual and intellectual values can flourish.
“‘Our other objectives are all means to an end. The enjoyment of the arts is an end in itself.'
“I was but three when he passed by, but I shall be grateful 'til the day I die.”

EA is turning all of its brands into what it calls "online universes".
At EA's UK showcase this week, EA's Northern Europe boss Keith Ramsdale said all of EA's game franchises, including FIFA, Battlefield, Medal of Honor, Star Wars, The Sims and Need for Speed, were being transformed in this way.
This means more than simple online play, Ramsdale explained. It involves being able to play a "brand" across multiple devices, each one contributing to a singular goal - and profile.
Ramsdale used FIFA by way of an example. "Imagine a player gets up in the morning, plays an online match on his 360 before going to work," he said. "On the bus, on his way to work, he practices his free kicks on his tablet. At lunch he looks at the transfer window on his PC. On the way home he chooses his kit on his smartphone.
On the bus, on his way to work, he practices his free kicks on his tablet. At lunch he looks at the transfer window on his PC. On the way home he chooses his kit on his smartphone.
"Here's the thing: when he gets home to play again on his 360 that evening, all those achievements and upgrades will be alive in his game."
Ramsdale said online universes allow the consumer to play "how he wants, when he wants and on the device he wants".
"We're very focused on transforming all of our brands into these online universes. That gives the consumer full control of how and when they play in a rich world of content."
We've already seen some of this with the BioWare developed Mass Effect 3. Players are able to contribute to their Galactic Readiness in the main game by playing the Mass Effect Datapad companion app on their smartphones.

Tanakh, the Hebrew Bible, is remarkable for the extreme realism with which it portrays human character. Its heroes are not superhuman. Its non-heroes are not archetypal villains. The best have failings; the worst often have saving virtues. I know of no other religious literature quite like it.
This makes it very difficult to use biblical narrative to teach a simple, black-and-white approach to ethics. And that – argued R. Zvi Hirsch Chajes (Mevo ha-Aggadot) – is why rabbinic midrash often systematically re-interprets the narrative so that the good become all-good and the bad all-bad. For sound educational reasons, Midrash paints the moral life in terms of black and white.
Yet the plain sense remains (“A biblical passage never loses its plain interpretation”, Shabbat 63a), and it is important that we do not lose sight of it. It is as if monotheism brought into being at the same time a profound humanism. God in the Hebrew Bible is nothing like the gods of myth. They were half-human, half-divine. The result was that in the epic literature of pagan cultures, human heroes were seen as almost as gods: semi-divine.
In stark contrast, monotheism creates a total distinction between God and humanity. If God is wholly God, then human beings can be seen as wholly human – subtle, complex mixtures of strength and weakness. We identify with the heroes of the Bible because, despite their greatness, they never cease to be human, nor do they aspire to be anything else. Hence the phenomenon of which the sedra of Beha'alotecha provides a shattering example: the vulnerability of some of the greatest religious leaders of all time, to depression and despair.
The context is familiar enough. The Israelites are complaining about their food: “The rabble among them began to crave other food, and again the Israelites started wailing and said, ‘If only we had meat to eat! We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost—also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic. But now we have lost our appetite; we never see anything but this manna!'”(Num 11: 4-6)
This is not a new story. We have heard it before (see for example Exodus 16). Yet on this occasion, Moses experiences what one can only call a breakdown:
He asked the Lord, “Why have you brought this trouble on your servant? What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me? Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth? . . . I cannot carry all these people by myself; the burden is too heavy for me. If this is how You are going to treat me, put me to death right now—if I have found favour in your eyes—and do not let me face my own ruin.” (Num. 11: 11-15)
Moses prays for death! Nor is he the only person in Tanakh to do so. There are at least three others. There is Elijah, when after his successful confrontation with the prophets of Baal at Mount Carmel, Queen Jezebel issues a warrant that he be killed:
Elijah was afraid and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there, while he himself went a day's journey into the desert. He came to a broom tree, sat down under it and prayed that he might die. “I have had enough, Lord,” he said. “Take my life; I am no better than my ancestors.” (I Kings 19: 3-4)
There is Jonah, after God had forgiven the inhabitants of Nineveh:
Jonah was greatly displeased and became angry. He prayed to the Lord, “O Lord, is this not what I said when I was still at home? That is why I was so quick to flee to Tarshish. I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love, a God who relents from sending calamity. Now, O Lord, take away my life, for it is better for me to die than to live.” (Jonah 4: 1-3)
And there is Jeremiah, after the people fail to heed his message and publicly humiliate him:
“O Lord, You enticed me, and I was enticed; You overpowered me and prevailed. I am ridiculed all day long; everyone mocks me . . . The word of the Lord has brought me insult and reproach all day long . . . Cursed be the day I was born! May the day my mother bore me not be blessed! Cursed be the man who brought my father the news, made him very glad, saying, “A child is born to you—a son!” . . . Why did I ever come out of the womb to see trouble and sorrow and to end my days in shame?” (Jeremiah 20: 7-18)
Lehavdil elef havdalot: no comparison is intended between the religious heroes of Tanakh and political heroes of the modern world. They are different types, living in different ages, functioning in different spheres. Yet we find a similar phenomenon in one of the great figures of the twentieth century, Winston Churchill.
Throughout much of his life he was prone to periods of acute depression. He called it “the black dog”. He told his daughter, “I have achieved a great deal to achieve nothing in the end”. He told a friend that “he prays every day for death”. In 1944 he told his doctor, Lord Moran, that he kept himself from standing close to a train platform or overlooking the side of a ship because he might be tempted to commit suicide: “A second's desperation would end everything” (these quotes are taken from Anthony Storr, Churchill's Black Dog).
Why are the greatest so often haunted by a sense of failure? Storr, in the book mentioned above, offers some compelling psychological insights. But at the simplest level we see certain common features, at least among the biblical prophets: a passionate drive to change the world, combined with a deep sense of personal inadequacy. Moses says, “Who am I . . . that I should lead the Israelites out of Egypt?” (Ex. 3: 11). Jeremiah says: “I cannot speak: I am only a child” (Jer. 1: 6). Jonah tries to flee from his mission.
The very sense of responsibility that leads a prophet to heed the call of God can lead him to blame himself when the people around him do not heed the same call.
Yet it is that same inner voice that ultimately holds the cure. The prophet does not believe in himself: he believes in God. He does not undertake to lead because he sees himself as a leader, but because he sees a task to be done and no one else willing to do it. His greatness lies not within himself but beyond himself: in his sense of being summoned to a task that must be done however inadequate he knows himself to be.
Despair can be part of leadership itself. For when the prophet sees himself reviled, rebuked, criticized; when his words fall on stony ground; when he sees people listening to what they want to hear, not what they need to hear – that is when the last layers of self are burned away, leaving only the task, the mission, the call. When that happens, a new greatness is born. It now no longer matters that the prophet is unpopular and unheeded. All that matters is the work and the One who has summoned him to it. That is when the prophet arrives at the truth stated by Rabbi Tarfon: “It is not for you to complete the task, but neither are you free to stand aside from it” (Avot 2: 16).
Again without seeking to equate the sacred and the secular, I end with some words spoken by Theodore Roosevelt (in a speech to students at the Sorbonne, Paris, 23 April 1910), which sum up both the challenge and the consolation of leadership in cadences of timeless eloquence:
It is not the critic who counts, Not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, Or where the doer of deeds could actually have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, Whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, Who strives valiantly, Who errs and comes short again and again – Because there is no effort without error and shortcomings – But who does actually strive to do the deed, Who knows great enthusiasm, great devotion, Who spends himself in a worthy cause,
Who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement.
And who, at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.
Leadership in a noble cause can bring despair. But it also is the cure.
With a year to go before Canadians return to the polls, the federal Liberals and New Democrats are building enormous voter-tracking databases in an attempt to cut into the Conservatives' longstanding electoral advantage identifying and getting out their vote.
In the last six months, both opposition parties have hired data analytics experts to co-ordinate what is expected to be a key tactical approach in the 2015 election campaign. And both have turned to U.S. political consulting firms with links to Barack Obama's presidential campaigns for their expertise in electronically tracking and targeting voters.
If Canada's 2011 campaign, played out daily on social media, was the “Twitter election,” then the October 2015 vote promises to be the “Big Data Election” – in which the sophisticated analysis of electronic records to identify supporters and get them to the ballot box could prove decisive.
Aping techniques pioneered by businesses to identify and track consumers, the parties are combining the voters' list with more general demographic data and applying the lessons of behavioural economics to “microtarget” narrow niches of the electorate whose votes they need.
Just as the “Moneyball” application of rigorous statistical analysis to player performance changed professional baseball, the use of Big Data to leverage votes is transforming the way political campaigns are run.
Where once elections were won and lost with stump speeches, leadership debates and TV ads, social scientific methods are now being applied to get out the vote and shake money from supporters.
Most importantly, these “predictive analytics” tell campaigns where to best allocate their scarce resources – online ads? direct mail? live calls to voters? – providing a particularly valuable edge in Canada, with its tight election-spending restrictions.
Over the past three election cycles, the Conservatives held a sharp edge in the big data race by harnessing their own data – gathered in what's called the Constituent Information Management System (CIMS) – to a muscular telephone contact capacity through a company called the Responsive Marketing Group.
In 2011, RMG's phone banks made millions of live telephone calls on behalf of Conservative candidates and the national campaign, with data from each logged and fed back into CIMS to help the campaign target its get-out-the-vote and fundraising resources. Records of past candidate support, likelihood of voting, donations, even whether the voter requested a lawn sign – and other information gleaned from calls to voters – are all captured by CIMS.
To keep pace, the New Democrats are overhauling their own data strategy, turning to 270 Strategies Inc., a Washington, D.C. and Chicago-based company staffed by alumni of past Obama campaigns.
With 270's help, the NDP is rebuilding its core voter-tracking and fundraising database, modernizing the NDP Vote system used in 2011.
The Broadbent Institute, which helps left-wing campaigns, is sending a small group of “progressive organizers” on five-week placements working on the U.S. midterm elections, through 270 Strategies.
For the NDP, the development of a data strategy focused on individual voters is a natural evolution from the grassroots campaigning that the party has historically relied on, says national director Anne McGrath.
The party's approach to canvassing still has its roots in the “Riverdale Model,” based on a Toronto provincial byelection the party won in 1964 by sending volunteers to every door in the riding three times and following up with a concerted get-out-the-vote drive.
“In some ways, it combines our traditional strengths with 21st-century technology,” McGrath said. “The NDP's traditional strength has been voter contact and getting out the vote.”
The party expects to fill its database with information culled from daily tracking polls, door-to-door canvassing, live calls, email outreach and Twitter polls.
The party in September hired a national data director, Andrew Brewin, a technology consultant. In May, the Liberals also hired a data expert, Sean Wiltshire, to run their party's in-house analytics operation.
Brewin and Wiltshire are part of a growing class of political strategists, with backgrounds steeped in statistics and computer modelling, that is squeezing out the old-school campaign advisers who ran elections based on instinct, experience and Scotch.
While Brewin has a family history in politics – his father and grandfather were both NDP MPs and his mother was an NDP MLA in British Columbia – Wiltshire comes from a science background. He's a PhD in microbiology, not political science, and his doctoral work concerned “genetics of host response to viral infection.”
In the U.S., with its two-party system, the effective use of data to target voters is thought to give a ballot-box boost of up to four percentage points to candidates – often more than the margin of victory in close races. More than 43 ridings in the 2011 Canadian federal election were decided by a smaller margin, and that number could be even higher with 30 new ridings in play for 2015.
While a centralized data structure can help a national campaign, it is only effective if campaign workers are feeding new information into it based on canvassing and telephone contacts. That takes training and buy-in from the local campaigns.
Since 2009, the Liberals have been using a database called Liberalist that was developed by NGP VAN, another Washington firm that has worked closely with the Democrats.
Heading into 2015, the Liberals hope to have better uptake on Liberalist from campaign staff and volunteers in all 338 ridings.
“The big difference is that it's not something that we're launching at election campaign time,” said national director Jeremy Broadhurst.
“You can collect all the data you want but do you have people on the ground who trained up or know how to use it?”
Candidates in last year's Liberal leadership race were encouraged to use the list, helping add data as they sold memberships, as are those now seeking party nominations.
“You have to convince people it can make you more efficient, it can make better decisions about how to deploy volunteers and where to be targeting those door-knockers and phone callers in a way that maximizes your chances of identifying the vote and getting the vote pulled on election day,” Broadhurst said.
The Conservatives, meanwhile, have scrapped their attempts to build a new voter-tracking system, but the party is renovating CIMS to add new capabilities for the 2015 election.
The dark side of election data is its potential for misuse. The CIMS database became notorious during the robocalls affair, when it was revealed that its records on identified non-Conservative supporters were used to make misleading calls to voters in Guelph on the 2011 election day. Michael Sona, a Conservative campaign worker, was convicted in August for his involvement in the “Pierre Poutine” calls, though the judge said it was likely others were involved. Unclear from his trial was who, exactly, downloaded the voter data from CIMS.
Whether the Tories can hold their data advantage in the next election will depend on how well they adapt to the new techniques pioneered by the Obama campaigns and now being used by their opponents, says Mike Martens, director of the School of Practical Politics at the Manning Centre.
“It all depends on whether the party has a strategy to do it this way,” Martens said.
“They need to train their volunteers to ask the right questions. It's probably a question other than ‘can we count on your support for candidate X?' Are you trying to collect as much data as possible or are you asking one question and moving on?”
The Conservatives declined to comment on their data-readiness.
“Election strategy is an internal matter,” said spokesman Cory Hann in an email.

The Indian Space Research Organisation has launched the first test flight of its newest rocket – the GSLV Mk.III – on Thursday, conducting a suborbital flight that also demonstrated a prototype crew capsule (CARE) for India's proposed manned missions. Liftoff from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre occurred at 09:30 local time (04:00 UTC).
ISRO Launch:
India's new rocket, which the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) refers to by the names GSLV Mk.III and LVM3, is a completely new vehicle marking the third generation for India's orbital launch systems.
The two-stage rocket is designed to place around 10 tonnes (9.8 Imperial tons, 11 US tons) of payload into low earth orbit or four tonnes (3.9 Imperial tons, 4.4 US tons) to a geosynchronous transfer orbit.
For Thursday's mission only the first stage and boosters were live, while the inert second stage was loaded with liquid nitrogen to simulate propellant.
India made its first attempt to launch a satellite on 10 August 1979, with its Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV) carrying the Rohini Technology Payload, or RTP, in a launch from the Sriharikota Range (now known as the Satish Dhawan Space Centre).
Control of the rocket was lost following a valve failure in the second stage thrust vectoring system, with the rocket falling into the bay of Bengal.
India's first successful launch came on 18 July in the following year, with the second Satellite Launch Vehicle orbiting the Rohini or RS-1 satellite.
In all, four Satellite Launch Vehicles were flown, with the third flight a failure and the fourth, in April 1983, a success.
With a capacity of only around 40 kilograms (90 lb) the SLV was unable to carry any significant payloads so an upgraded version, the Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV) was introduced.
Based around the SLV, the ASLV added two more solid motors, burning together as the rocket's first stage, to the sides of the vehicle. A modified version of the four stage SLV served as the second, third, fourth and fifth stages of the ASLV.
The ASLV made its first flight from a new complex at Sriharikota, located close to the SLV pad, on 24 March 1987. The first two launches failed to achieve orbit, while the third left ISRO's SROSS-C satellite in a lower-than-planned orbit.
Funding for the ASLV was cut in favour of the more capable Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle which by then under development, with the final ASLV launch on 4 May 1994 successfully carrying SROSS-C2 into orbit.
The PSLV began a new generation for India's rockets; the only significant commonality PSLV and its predecessors was the use of S-9 motors – which had made up the first stage of the SLV and the first and second stages of the ASLV – as boosters attached to its first stage.
Far larger than its predecessors, the PSLV introduced a large solid first stage, with liquid second and fourth stages and another solid for the third stage. In its standard configuration it can place up to 3,700 kilograms (8,200 lb) of payload into low Earth orbit.
Having made 28 launches since September 1993, the PSLV has been used for two thirds of India's orbital launches to date. In addition to being India's most-flown rocket it is also the country's most reliable, having suffered only one failure – during its maiden flight – and one partial failure in two decades of service.
Two additional configurations, the PSLV-CA (or Core Alone) and PSLV-XL have been developed to accommodate smaller and larger payloads respectively. The Core Alone configuration eliminates the boosters from the first stage, while the PSLV-XL replaces them with larger S-12 motors.
The most recently-developed orbital launch system in India's fleet is the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle, or GSLV. This vehicle was introduced in 2001 with the aim of enabling India to deploy its own communications satellites without relying on foreign rockets – providing a payload capacity of up to 2,200 kilograms (4,900 lb) to geosynchronous transfer orbit.
Based on the PSLV, it replaces the solid rocket boosters with larger liquid boosters and introduces a cryogenically-fuelled third stage. Early flights of the GSLV Mk.I used a Russian KVD-1M engine on the third stage, however the Mk.II configuration, first flown in April 2010, has an Indian-built engine in its place.
Despite ISRO's hopes for the vehicle, the GSLV has proven unreliable with a success rate of only 37.5 percent. Only three of its eight launches to date have reached their planned orbits, with one additional launch reaching a usable, though lower-than-planned, orbit. January's successful deployment of GSAT-14 was the GSLV's first flawless mission in almost ten years.
The LVM-3 or GSLV Mk.III is completely new development, a two stage rocket with twin solid boosters augmenting an all-liquid core vehicle.
The first stage, or L110, is powered by two Vikas engines, derived from France's Viking series used on Ariane rockets between 1979 and 2004. Burning Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) propellant oxidised by dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4), the L110 will be air-lit almost two minutes after the rocket lifts off under the power of its two booster rockets.
Each of the two S200 boosters will burn 207 tonnes (204 Imperial tons, 228 US tons) of solid propellant – a mixture of ammonium perchlorate, aluminium and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB).
The rocket's second stage, which was not tested on Thursday's mission, is designated the C25. It was powered by a CE20 engine burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen; however for the maiden flight the second stage was inert, loaded with liquid nitrogen to simulate propellant.
The name of the new rocket remains unclear, with ISRO continuing to refer to the rocket as both the LVM3 and GSLV Mk.III.
The payload for Thursday's maiden launch was the Crew Module Atmospheric Reentry Experiment (CARE), which demonstrated the crew capsule which ISRO has been developing for its manned programme. The primary objective of CARE's mission wa to validate the reentry and recovery of the prototype spacecraft.
The 3,735-kilogram (8,234 lb) spacecraft flew without the service module that will eventually accompany it on manned missions; instead it was attached to the second stage of its carrier rocket upside-down, inside the payload fairing.
By launching upside-down, ISRO aim was to simplify the CARE mission and increase the chances of success; eliminating the risk of having to modify the capsule's heat shield to interface with the rocket and removing the need for the spacecraft to manoeuvre to reentry attitude following launch.
With the CARE mission, ISRO's manned vehicle became the second such spacecraft to undergo a flight test this month; on 5 December NASA launched its Exploration Flight Test 1 mission to demonstrate its Orion spacecraft.
Although a more sophisticated flight than CARE, with the Orion spacecraft making two orbits of the Earth and entering at greater velocity from a higher apogee, EFT-1 had similar objectives to India's mission – testing the spacecraft's performance during reentry and validating recovery procedures.
The GSLV Mk.III launched from the Second Launch Pad (SLP) at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, a complex constructed in the early 2000s for the PSLV and GSLV Mk.I. Thursday's was the thirteenth launch from the pad, which was first used for the May 2005 launch of CartoSat-1 on a PSLV.
The second pad has been used for all GSLV launches since its completion, along with a handful of PSLV launches. The majority of PSLV missions are conducted from the nearby First Launch Pad.
For launches from the second pad, rockets are assembled vertically atop a mobile platform in an integration building about a kilometre southwest of the launch pad. The GSLV Mk.III prototype was rolled out a week ahead of launch to allow testing and rehearsals to be conducted in advance of liftoff.
Despite its name, the Second Launch Pad was not the second pad to be constructed at the centre; the numbering system does not take into account the two disused complexes which once hosted the Satellite Launch Vehicle and Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle, nor does it include several sounding rocket pads.
The Satish Dhawan Space Centre, which was formerly known as the Sriharikota Range, is named after former ISRO chairman Satish Dhawan. The facility was renamed in 2002 following the death of Dhawan in January of that year. It has been the site for all of India's orbital launches. A third launch pad is currently under construction at the site to accommodate future missions, particularly for India's manned space programme.
The rocket that flew Thursday's mission has been designated GSLV Mk.III X1, or LVM3-X1. It flew in what ISRO consider a typical GSLV Mk.III flight profile up to the end of first stage flight, after which a series of simulated flight events occurred and the CARE spacecraft was deployed for its reentry experiment.
The launch began when the countdown reached zero, with ignition of the two S200 solid rocket motors. The rocket climbed away from its launch pad, flying on an azimuth of 120 degrees.
The first stage engines ignited 114.71 seconds after liftoff, at an altitude of 43.43 kilometres (26.99 miles, 23.45 nautical miles). The boosters burned together with the first stage until the 148.98 second mark in the launch, at which point they separated from the vehicle. Each booster was fitted with six separation motors which fired to take it clear of the core vehicle.
Three minutes and 52.7 seconds after liftoff the payload fairing separated from around the CARE spacecraft. The GSLV Mk.III used a fairing with a diameter of five metres (16 feet) designed to encapsulate the payload and protect it from atmospheric friction during its ascent to space.
First stage flight ended with the Vikas engines shutting down five minutes and 17.62 seconds after liftoff. The spent first stage separated from the second stage mockup 2.8 seconds later. Eleven tenths of a second after staging, the second stage simulated its own shutdown and spacecraft separation occurred four seconds later.
The GSLV accelerated CARE to a velocity of around 5.3 kilometres per second (3.3 miles per second, 12,000 mph) and a projected apogee of 126 kilometres (78 miles, 68 nautical miles), plus or minus one kilometre, which was achieved around the time of stage separation.
Immediately after separating from the rocket, CARE activated its control systems, consisting of six reaction control system thrusters each capable of delivering 100 newtons of thrust. The RCS was used to provide three-axis control, guiding the spacecraft for the first two minutes and eleven seconds of free flight, before being deactivated around the time of entry interface as the spacecraft performed an unguided ballistic descent.
Following entry interface, deployment of CARE's drogue parachutes occurred nine minutes and 40 seconds into the mission, at an altitude of 15.4 kilometres. The drogue chutes slowed the capsule as it continued its descent, until the main parachutes were deployed around 202 seconds later with the spacecraft three kilometres above the Indian Ocean.
Splashdown occurred around 180 kilometres south of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where CARE will be recovered by the Indian Coast Guard. In all the mission lasted nineteen minutes from liftoff to splashdown.
Thursday's mission concluded ISRO's launch activities for 2014, following four successful orbital launches earlier in the year. The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle began the year on 5 January with the deployment of GSAT-14 – the first successful launch of the GSLV Mk.II and the first for any GSLV configuration since 2004, ending a string of four consecutive launch failures.
PSLV launches in April and October deployed IRNSS navigation satellites, while a further PSLV launch in June orbited France's SPOT-7 imaging satellite along with several miniature satellites.
India's first launch next year will be of a PSLV-XL with another IRNSS spacecraft. This will be the first of several IRNSS launches in 2015, with missions to deploy a trio of British imaging satellites and ISRO's AstroSat astronomy spacecraft also tentatively planned.
A development flight of the GSLV Mk.II is scheduled for around the end of the first quarter, carrying the GSAT-6 military communications satellite.
The GSLV Mk.III is not expected to fly again until 2016 or early 2017, when the rocket will make its first orbital flight – designated D1 – with the GSAT-19E spacecraft.
Ever wanted to be locked in a shopping mall when you were a kid? Well, now you can LIVE in one if you're based in Rhode Island. The Arcade providence, America's first indoor shopping mall that was build in 1828, has been repurposed into a residential structure with 48 low-cost micro-lofts since it fell into decline in the late 20th century. The mall was transformed at a cost of $7 million by Northeast Collaborative Architects
Starting at $550 a month, residents can rent a one-bedroom unit from 225-800 sq. ft. Each apartment contains a kitchen, full bath with shower, built-in beds, seating and storage. There are no stoves in the units as they are designed for the people who lead busy lifestyles but the tenants can eat at freshly designed restaurants on the ground floor and enjoy vibrant evenings in a shared lounge. There's also a shared laundry facility and a bike storage room as well as parking garage across the street. Would you live in such an apartment?

I'll look into War Cry. Haven't ever overcapped it before, and truth be told, I have no idea what scales and what doesn't and how. If I do take points out of it, they'll be going into Scars of Battle for the Stun Resistance.
I always take Squad Tactics to 8/12. Any levels beyond that provide very miniscule bonuses. I think, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, but over the course of the next four points you get a total of 5% Attack Speed and 10% Total Damage? Not terribly great efficiency/point, if you ask me.
I had actual rings at one time! Two very strong double-affixed Cronley rings. Check out the "Other Details" section for why I swapped. That variant of the build hit tremendously harder, but from a min/max point of view, there's no point; you oneshot more or less every white-mob with this version, so the extra damage in the other version is just overkill that you can't even lifesteal from.
Regarding Blade Arc/War Cry vs. Troll Rage/War Cry: Markovian's Advantage is very strong for bosskilling, and Zolhan's Technique gives me a whopping 1% more Weapon Damage than Blade Arc does, so single-target aspect of the build comes from the Mistborn relic. Blade Arc will certainly clear groups faster, but when I'm at 160% attack speed, getting Troll Rage to 5 stacks doesn't take a lot of time at all. After that, the process is Blade Arc -> Blitz to next mob pack -> Blade Arc two times, walk to next mob pack, keeping War Cry up as needed. It's all very efficient, in my opinion. Not to mention that I simply don't have the energy support to use sustained Blade Arcs; I'll burn myself out during the cooldown of an energy pot and be left with nothing, which isn't safe.
Finally, just using one attack gets boring pretty fast. This build is legitimately fun to play because you're not just holding one button all day! The gameplay is riveting and entertaining. And that's what counts.

Quote: Falacer Originally Posted by Very nice Ceno! Excellent 2H build!! Yup, you're right. I have one point in it. I think that point came from Military Conditioning, so that its leveled at 12/12 rather than 13/12. Good catch.Because MW is more or less godlike once you get it high enough. Also, without something like Pneumatic Burst or Vindictive Flame, the sustainability of this build is pretty bad (48 health regen, 10% lifesteal) imo, so I needed some form of healing. I'm planning on adapting this build's weapon swap to use a 1H-Mace + Shield, in which case MW will still work too.Specifically, as to why I pumped it so high, I'm a point away (19/16 as opposed to 20/16) to getting its cooldown to only 22 seconds, which more or less means I can heal to full health fairly often, relying on the brunt defensiveness of the build during the skill's ever-decreasing cooldown. I don't know, seems really strong to me.Shaman is the plan, assuming it looks like it does now (which both Zantai and jiaco insist it won't). Basically, like this:The Zeal proc is really bad, which kind of steered me away from it. I have one sitting around, not impressed. I suspect it'll just gather dust until it gets buffed (though it was just nerfed). Somewhere down the line, maybe, or I'll use Juggernaut or a Legendary Relic depending on the timeframe/how lucky I get. Not sure.I'll look into War Cry. Haven't ever overcapped it before, and truth be told, I have no idea what scales and what doesn't and how.If I do take points out of it, they'll be going into Scars of Battle for the Stun Resistance.I always take Squad Tactics to 8/12. Any levels beyond that provide very miniscule bonuses. I think, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, but over the course of the next four points you get a total of 5% Attack Speed and 10% Total Damage? Not terribly great efficiency/point, if you ask me.I had actual rings at one time!Two very strong double-affixed Cronley rings. Check out the "Other Details" section for why I swapped. That variant of the build hit tremendously harder, but from a min/max point of view, there's no point; you oneshot more or less every white-mob with this version, so the extra damage in the other version is just overkill that you can't even lifesteal from.Regarding Blade Arc/War Cry vs. Troll Rage/War Cry: Markovian's Advantage is very strong for bosskilling, and Zolhan's Technique gives me a whopping 1% more Weapon Damage than Blade Arc does, so single-target aspect of the build comes from the Mistborn relic. Blade Arc will certainly clear groups faster, but when I'm at 160% attack speed, getting Troll Rage to 5 stacks doesn't take a lot of time at all. After that, the process is Blade Arc -> Blitz to next mob pack -> Blade Arc two times, walk to next mob pack, keeping War Cry up as needed. It's all very efficient, in my opinion. Not to mention that I simply don't have the energy support to use sustained Blade Arcs; I'll burn myself out during the cooldown of an energy pot and be left with nothing, which isn't safe.Finally, just using one attack gets boring pretty fast. This build is legitimately fun to play because you're not just holding one button all day! The gameplay is riveting and entertaining. And that's what counts.Please do.See my reply to ex cathedra. I think they're worth it, personally. MA is really strong for bosskilling, especially when combined with the War Cry/Break Morale debuff. ZT is basically a higher-hitting fewer-target version of Blade Arc. I like them both, but I guess it's personal preference.D: I'll get a +skills picture up tonight! For reference, its +2 Soldiers and +1 All (or +3 Soldiers if you use a Warmaster's Pride).Thank you! It was a ton of fun to make and its even more fun to play!

Syracuse, N.Y. — John Gillon, a graduate transfer from Colorado State University, has committed to Syracuse, he confirmed on Sunday.
Gillon, a 6-foot point guard, talked to syracuse.com while making a connection in Chicago after visiting the Syracuse University this weekend.
The Houston, Texas, native chose Syracuse over offers from Oklahoma and Texas A&M. Gillon said he had a good visit, but made the decision after a talk with Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim.
"He looked me in the eye and told me all the things he expected of me,'' Gillon said. "He needed a solid player at the point guard position. He wanted someone who could make plays for people and score.''
Gillon broke the news on his Twitter page.
Gillon began his college career at Arkansas-Little Rock. He transferred to Colorado State after his freshman season. He sat out one year and then played for the Rams the past two seasons.
Gillon started 26 games for the Rams last season and averaged 13.2 points and 3.8 assists per game. He could have returned to Colorado State for his fifth year but, after earning his degree in economics, decided to transfer.
He said Syracuse's run to the 2016 Final Four in Houston had little impact on his decision.
"The fact that they made it just confirmed what I already knew,'' Gillon said. "Syracuse has a great program.''
Gillon had planned on visiting Oklahoma and Texas A&M, but he said he felt ready to commit to Syracuse after the weekend visit.
"I just wanted to go someplace where I'd play, where I could be successful, where we'd make the NCAA tournament and have chance to make a good NCAA run,'' Gillon said. "And, hopefully, I'll be able to play after college.''
Nintendo president outlines plans for 2016; NX details coming Nintendo's new president has outlined his plans for the company, which includes details on the Nintendo NX, the future of its smartphone apps, and more.
Nintendo president Tatsumi Kimishima has revealed the company's plans for 2016, which includes the Nintendo NX, film and TV, and more.
Kimishima-san published his outline of 2016 in Mainichi Shimbun and says Nintendo would like to surprise fans with new ideas this year, and not build on old ones. As a result, Nintendo plans on releasing details of its upcoming console, the Nintendo NX.
Beyond consoles, Kimishima-san reveals the first smartphone app from Nintendo will be rolled out in March 2016 and promises apps with well-known characters will launch in 2016. Outside of the smartphone business, Kimishima-san also plans on expanding Nintendo's reach to theme parks, movies, and TV animes.
As for Nintendo's financials, Kimishima-san plans to bring profits to 100 billion yen ($855 million) in “several years.”
A report was published in late 2015 that says the Nintendo NX will enter mass production at the end of Q1 2016. If that report turns out to be true, then we should hopefully hear more about the upcoming console sooner rather than later.
Police have charged a man with animal neglect after they found 62 ducks crowded in cages inside an abandoned van at an Iowa City Hy-Vee.
69 year old Francis Prohaska faces the charge after police found the ducks while responding to a call of a bad odor coming from a vehicle.
Once police arrived, they say 19 of the ducks were dead in their cages, while the remaining ducks were covered in feces and feathers and without food or water.
Police noted the poor condition of the remaining ducks saying they were obviously dehydrated, undernourished, and with poor plumage.
The ducks were taken and treated by Iowa City Animal Control, given food and water, and examined by a veterinarian.
The birds were deemed neglected after the conclusion of the veterinarian's examination.
Angular 1.0 Turns Five Years Old
A brief history lesson
Chris Brandrick Blocked Unblock Follow Jun 16, 2017
It's been five years since Angular hit its initial 1.0 release:
However, despite reaching 1.0 in 2012 the web application framework was originally conceived back in 2009.
In a post on his personal blog co-author Miško Hevery proclaimed “Hello World, <angular/> is here”, introducing the developer community to Angular's offer. At the time Angular was presented as an enterprise product.
Miško explained that Angular was very much an in-beta project looking for a “few brave souls” to start testing and offering feedback.
Here's how Angular was initially pitched:
“We would like to introduce to you a new way of building web applications! All you need is basic working of HTML & CSS and you can declaratively build a web-application in minutes. “
What began as something of a side-project turned enterprise venture soon changed focus, with the framework eventually being open-sourced, and maintained by Google, the following year.
AngularJS first appeared on GitHub with version 0.9.0 in October of 2010.
Version 1.0 launched on June 14th, 2012.
Miško detailed that the goal of AngularJS was “to eliminate the guesswork in creating web app structure and take the pain and the boilerplate out of web client apps”.
So, is it Angular or AngularJS?
The easy answer is this: Anything that's version 1.x tends to be known as AngularJS, and everything after version 2 and above is known simply as Angular.
AngularJS is still maintained and now lives at angularjs.org.
Straight up Angular (at angular.io) is where the focus now lies, with one single framework aiming to serve both mobile and desktop needs. Angular is a complete rewrite of what came before it, and represents a clean cut away from AngularJS 1.x.
Angular 2.0
Announced in September of 2014, Angular 2.0 caused something of an upset as it came to light that there would be no migration path from 1.x to 2.x. That, combined with a range of syntax changes made for a rocky debut. By this point in time AngularJS had become a highly popular JS framework, so any major changes were bound to cause some dismay.
However, it wasn't all bad, as pointed out here by Jesus Rodriguez — Angular 2.0 brought with it new features and welcome simplification.
Questions relating to Angular on Stack Overflow over the years
The final release version of Angular 2 finally arrived in September of 2016.
Version 4.0
Yup, no version three. Google decided to skip a 3.0 release and went straight to version 4. Google's Igor Minar explained that the jump from 2 to 4 was to avoid any confusion with Angular's then router version (which stood at 3.3.0).
Unlike the jump from 1.x to 2.x this time the team promised backwards compatibility between versions 2 and 4. Minar noted that they did not want to make “any breaking changes that will break the ecosystem”.
Today, Angular is one of the most starred projects on GitHub, with both AngularJS and Angular having over 75,000 combined stars.
Angular has had something of an interesting journey so far. Let's see where the next five years takes us! 😄
A Winnipeg school yard became the scene of a homicide investigation after a violent incident unfolded there Wednesday morning.
According to police, it happened at around 2:30 a.m. in the 100 block of Charles Walk near David Livingstone School.
Police said they responded to the report of an injured person after an incident started in the field of the school.
Officials said they arrived on scene to find two men with serious injuries. One man was unconscious and not breathing. An officer performed CPR until paramedics arrived. Another man suffered serious injuries.
Both men were transported to hospital in critical condition. One man later died, police said.
The Winnipeg School Division said staff directed students coming to school through another entrance away from the investigation.
It said access to the field will be restricted to students during the investigation, but classes will proceed as normal.
Raisel Iglesias entered this season as the ultimate unknown. The Reds signed the Cuban defector to a seven-year, $27 million contract in June of last year, with designs of using him as a starting pitcher in the long-term. The right-hander had been used primarily as a long reliever in the Cuban National Series, going two to three innings per game, but such usage patterns are more indicative of a league that favors tournament-style play than an indictment of a pitcher's stamina. The expectation was that Iglesias would start the season in the minors, adjusting to pro ball in his new country. He had seven crisp innings in the AFL that had scouts buzzing last November, and he pitched well over 14 2/3 innings this spring, but it was enough to convince the Cincinnati brass that the 25-year old was ready and he broke camp with the big club. Iglesias made his MLB debut on April 12 against the St. Louis Cardinals, and though he was understandably on a strict pitch count, the right-hander wasted no time in returning some value on the team's investment. Game Stats IP R H BB K PC 5.0 3 5 2 4 76 Iglesias blanked the Cardinals for four frames, not allowing a baserunner until Kolten Wong's bloop single with one out in the third inning. He struck out four batters and walked just one until the fifth, at which point things began to unravel. It started with a rocket down the thirdbase line for a double by Yadier Molina, followed by a walk to Wong on a 3-2 count and a sac bunt to the pitcher than put two runners in scoring position with one out. At this point, Tony Cingrani began warming up in the Reds bullpen, but he was kept on ice while the Cards knocked consecutive hits that plated three runs, the last of which was a deep drive by Jayson Heyward, who was thrown out trying to stretch it into a triple. Iglesias was allowed to finish the inning, after which point his day was done. Iglesias threw 76 total pitches on the day, and though his command wavered as he got deeper into the game, there was no indication of fatigue in his velocity numbers. He pumped 47 fastballs that averaged 92.3 mph and spiked 95, but velocity was actually the least impressive of the pitch's attributes. For the first few innings, Iglesias displayed excellent command with a particular knack for locating the pitch on the lower shelf of the strike zone, and he could manipulate the movement on his fastball at will in order to facilitate various locations around the zone. The movement was the most impressive trait of his heater, with late cut on his four-seamer and arm-side drift on the two-seam variety. Just take a look at the backwards K of Matt Holliday, a sinker that triggered 94.0 mph on the gun with enough movement to freeze a 12-year veteran like a deer in headlights.
The slider was inconsistent, with a tendency to pull the pitch far to the glove side, but the slide had sharp movement and flashed the potential to be a put-away offering, One has to wonder if his use of variable arm slots (which could be tied to specific pitch types) might eventually work as a tip-off to opposing batters, particularly once the advanced scouts have made their rounds on him, but for now his deception will be aided by the novelty. Iglesias tossed a few changeups in his debut, but the pitch was an afterthought; his performance was largely driven by the location and movement of his fastball variations.
He was sent down to the minors after the game, and the recent activation of Homer Bailey from the disabled list effectively pushes Iglesias down the depth chart of the Reds' rotation. He has the look of a pitcher who could earn his way back to the show in short order, so there is a very good chance that Iglesias resurfaces soon, that is unless the Reds can replicate the 2012 Cincinnati team that got 161 starts out of the core five (including current stalwarts Bailey, Johnny Cueto, and Mike Leake). Mechanics Report Card Balance 50 Momentum 60 Torque 50 Posture 65 Repetition 55 Overall B- Comparing a ballplayer to his countrymen is often a lazy overture, but in the case of pitchers that hail from Cuba, there is often a blatant template that has been borrowed from those who have left the island and found success in the States. For example, Ordisamer Despaigne borrows several aspects of his delivery from Orlando Hernandez, and one of those traits is a variable arm slot that constantly moves the batter's visual window. Iglesias has a leg kick that is more reminiscent of fellow Red Aroldis Chapman, but he incorporates the ever-changing arm slot to an extreme, drawing comparisons to former Red Bronson Arroyo. Iglesias will sometimes drop down into what amounts to a submarine delivery, such as in the above GIF of his slider, and any spine-tilt at release is veering toward the arm side. On other pitches he will lean the other direction, tilting slightly glove-side while raising his angle of shoulder abduction to manipulate a higher slot, such as in the following clip:
The tendency to tuck into leg lift and hunch over during stride harms his grade for balance, as does his tendency to drop out of the top of his delivery. He finishes very low, with a release height that falls between five and five-and-a-half feet depending on the arm slot (about two standard deviations below the mean). The lateral balance is otherwise strong and his Z-plane balance (rubber to plate) is nearly perfect, such that the net result is a league-average grade for his dynamic stability. He generally finishes with excellent posture, spiking a 70-grade at peak, and though his spine-tilt will engage differently based on the desired arm slot, he also relies much more on shoulder abduction to raise and lower his release point. His momentum is very efficient, carving a direct path to the plate that begins with a strong first move and continues to accelerate with a smooth transition through lift and stride. When at his best, Iglesias follows the baseball after release point as his momentum carries him forward during follow-through. He engages a slide step from the stretch, and the early returns suggest that he struggles to harness the quicker timing pattern. He also fell into a rush in the fourth and fifth innings of the game on the twelfth, speeding up his momentum from the windup as well as the stretch, and though an increase in speed is desirable in a vacuum, in many cases (such as this one) the quicker pace to the plate disrupts the pitcher's timing. His timing signature seemed best aligned with 60-grade momentum.
Iglesias has rather low torque for a pitcher who throws so hard. His trigger has some delay after foot strike, but rather than utilize the technique to generate plus hip-shoulder separation, the right-hander is merely compensating for late hip rotation and modest upper-body load. His repetition of timing was surprisingly strong for a young pitcher, that is until later in the ballgame when fatigue may have set in and his delivery was compromised. He presents a rather unique combination of mechanical strengths and weaknesses, but then again I'm growing accustomed to Cuban pitchers breaking the scale, as more than one report card is necessary to accurately describe the deliveries of El Duque, Despaigne, and Iglesias.

In February, I posed the question of whether CBS was pricing itself out of the play-for-cash fantasy sports market by offering fantasy baseball payout rates in the 50-70% range, while the market rate for fantasy baseball contest payouts was between 80% and 90%.
I noted that declining legal risk of these contests was leading to new market competitors, and that new market competition was leading to greater pricing pressures.
This week, CBS Sports released its prize structure for 2014 fantasy football. And once again, CBS's payout rate seems to be far lower than that of the marketplace overall.
According to CBS's fantasy football webpage, its 2014 contests will include games with entry fees ranging from $39.99 to $999.99 Each of these contests will consist 12 teams, and each league will pay prize money to either the first one or two finishers in the league depending on the league's price point.
Excluding discounts for repeat purchase, CBS league payouts for 2014 fantasy football range from a low of 41.7% for contests are the $39.99 price point ($200 payout of a $479.88 prize pool), to a high of 58.3% for contests at the $499.99 and $999.99 price points ($3500 payout of a $5999.88 prize pool, and $7000 payout of a $11999.88 prize pool).
Other fantasy football host sites that are newer to the market than CBS continue to offer far higher payout rates. For example, Yahoo ! offered fantasy football in 2013 at payout rates well above 80%.
Yahoo! has not announced its 2014 contest entry fees or payout rates yet; however, one would expect them to be made available soon.
Meanwhile, the Fantasy Football Players Championship, which is best known for hosting a huge live draft event each year in Las Vegas, is offering a 12-team Classic Draft Satellite Leagues at the $150 price point, which includes a payout rate of 83.3% for entrants into these satellite contests ($1500 payout of an $1800 prize pool).
At the same time, daily fantasy sports websites such as Fan Duel, DraftKings and others continue to offer contest payout rates of nearly 90%. This payout rate has remained robust with continued new entry into the daily fantasy sports marketplace.
As legal issues related to operating play-for-cash fantasy football contests continue to subside, CBS will continue to find itself facing new competition in hosting this sort of contests.
It will be interesting to see how long CBS is able to maintain its current payout rates and yet still avoid losing substantial market share to a growing number of other competitors.

The Gay U.S. Ambassador Who Moonlights as a TV Star
People often ask U.S. Ambassador to Denmark Rufus Gifford why he's so public about being gay. He explains to The Advocate why it matters to say 'gay,' especially when the cameras are rolling.
If you've never heard of Rufus Gifford, you're probably not in Denmark.
Gifford is the 41-year-old American ambassador to the Kingdom of Denmark, and he's hugely popular in the small Nordic country of 5.6 million people — for good reason. While Gifford's hard work and experience led President Obama to appoint him to the role in 2013, most Danes know him through his prime-time TV documentary series, Jeg er Ambassadøren fra Amerika (I Am the Ambassador From America). The show has been a national hit since it began in 2014, and in July earned Gifford the Danish equivalent of an Emmy Award.
In truth, Gifford has become something of a national celebrity. His eloquence, ever-present smile, straightforward manner, and striking good looks have many Danes talking and tweeting about the ambassador. When he is spotted on the streets of Copenhagen or in small towns across the country, people often shout out, “Rufus!” Wholly dispensing with the honorific of his office, citizens often ask Gifford to pose for a selfie. The TV show has allowed many Danes to feel that they've gotten to know the ambassador — and through him, that they've come to know the U.S. That's exactly how Gifford wants it.
“Ultimately, I think that there's too big a gap between people in power and [the population they serve],” Gifford tells The Advocate, which recently met with the ambassador as he went about a day of work in Copenhagen. “You see this in countries around the world, and we have to do a better job at communicating with people in an honest, human way. If people have a better understanding of each other, we can have more productive societies. That's why I've chosen to be as open as I have been.”
But his openness about his day-to-day life, including his recent marriage to longtime partner Dr. Stephen DeVincent in Copenhagen's stately City Hall, carries with it a certain amount of risk, especially for an international diplomat. Gifford has endured criticism in the Danish press that he isn't being serious enough, and indeed, the TV series can at times border on reality-show salaciousness, taking viewers into deeply personal territory and vulnerable situations. In one scene, cameras catch the ambassador in his Calvin Kleins as he changes into a SWAT uniform. Despite the critiques, Gifford clearly takes his role in Denmark seriously, working tirelessly to further his and the State Department's goal to strengthen the long-standing, already-positive relationship between the U.S. and Denmark.
Gifford is one of six LGBT individuals serving the United States as ambassadors in embassies around the globe. He's been consistently open about being gay, and often refers to his personal story of coming out in a time when doing so effectively ruled out roles in political leadership.
“Like for so many of us, the idea that this would have happened for me is such a dream; it's just not real,” says the ambassador, sitting in the official Embassy residence he shares with his husband north of Copenhagen. “I wish my 15-year-old self could have seen what my life is now, because that was a time when I had almost no hope.”
Back then, Gifford continues, “You just didn't believe that these were options for [LGBT people]. You realize that the possibilities you may not have thought were there 10 years ago are there now. Of course, working your butt off [is a big part of it].”
Gifford is keenly aware that along with success and the profile of his office comes the responsibility to be active, to be public.
“I get challenged on that here,” he says. “People ask, ‘Why are you so public? Why do you talk about this so much?' But it matters. It matters because you see the notes from 20-year-old LGBT people — and 70-year-olds — saying, ‘Thank you!' Those are the people I wish had been talking to me when I was younger.”
Admittedly, Gifford's position as an openly gay U.S. ambassador is not, on its own, headline-grabbing material in a hyper-progressive, gay-friendly Scandinavian nation that has long had a friendly relationship with the U.S. But advancing President Obama's mandate to promote global and human rights requires more than mere acceptance, Gifford contends.

“The role here is ultimately about visibility,” explains the ambassador. “It involves talking about [LGBT] issues in a way that is meaningful — and I don't mean just announcing the fact that I'm gay, although that is part of it. It's being out and talking about [being gay] in a way that isn't provocative. Sometimes it's as simple as saying Stephen's name in a sentence and having that not be provocative — the fact that I'm saying a man's name as my husband.”
In early October, Gifford and DeVincent married in the Københavns Rådhus (Copenhagen City Hall), where the world's first legal same-sex unions were performed in 1989. While their marriage in Copenhagen City Hall was a “tipping of the hat” to the groundbreaking legal rights granted to same-sex couples for the first time 26 years ago almost to the day, the driving factor in choosing to wed in Denmark was simply the men's life together.
“It just made sense when we put it all together,” says Gifford. The celebrated event was highly visible and attracted the attention of viewers and bloggers from around the world via social media, much of it thanks to Gifford's own Instagram postings and Twitter hashtags throughout the day. More recently, poignant scenes from the ceremony were aired on the concluding chapter of Jeg er Ambassadøren fra Amerika.
“We represent the USA in Denmark, but we're also just a couple,” adds DeVincent, a veterinary doctor who splits his time between two international wildlife agencies based in Denmark and overseeing the running of Rydhave, the 1885 mansion north of Copenhagen that functions as the official residence to the U.S. ambassador. “For us, [this is simply] our life. In 20 years, it's just going to be the way it is.”
Given their high profile, DeVincent says he appreciates that he and Gifford are asked about their relationship, because “gay youth or a grandmother or parent somewhere” can see them together and hear their responses. “We may just be here, but it's to everyone's advantage that we're trying to share with folks our life together.'”
The men are also aware of the uniquely privileged moment in history and place in the world that they occupy.
“In a country like Denmark it's easy to forget that these issues are still a big deal in several parts of the world — and in parts of the world that are not very far away from where we are right now,” says Gifford. Parts of the world like Eastern Europe and Russia.
But that only strengthens his resolve, says Gifford:
“Eastern Europe has enormous challenges, and the rise of the far right is very real [across] Europe. When you rest on your laurels and think that the journey is over, that you don't have to fight anymore, that's when you start losing again. “So part of the role is that — reminding people that in a global world, you cannot just be responsible to only one country, you cannot just stop. I like to live in a world where we look beyond just our own borders.”
In August, Gifford and DeVincent led the annual Pride Parade for the U.S. Embassy, the only embassy in Copenhagen to host such an event. British Ambassador Vivien Life marched with them.
It's a celebration that marks a striking shift in terms of the American position on the global scale of LGBT equality, Gifford notes. Suddenly “the Americans are leading the way on this,” he opines. “Five or 10 years ago, there would have been questioning of the U.S. on this issue — no longer. The U.S. has a terrible brand on certain issues, but, at this point [and on this issue], it's a little unfair. Look at how far we've come.”
The Ambassador isn't the only one to notice the rapid evolution in American support for equality. Gifford recounts a story of running into a Frenchman who lives in Copenhagen:
“The man had been at the parade and he said to me something like, ‘Who would have thought that the United States of America was going to be the only country marching in the Copenhagen Gay Pride Parade? I was so proud, and I'm not even an American; I'm French. And the French have been on the leading edge of human rights, but we weren't there.' And it was just really wonderful to hear.”
It's not the first time the ambassador has been proud of America's progressive stand on LGBT issues while living and working in Denmark. In June, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution required legal marriage equality in all 50 states, Ambassador Gifford learned of the news on a TV monitor glimpsed as he was leaving a meeting.
“It was just one of those things when you immediately get goose bumps; you get choked up,” Gifford says. “I called Stephen and said, ‘They did it!' And he knew exactly what I was talking about.” He tells The Advocate that he was emotional at first, but then experienced a deep sense of pride later that night when he realized that he was going to bed in an official American residence, beneath the American flag on such a pivotal day for the country.
“The interesting thing is that we used to be so far behind this part of the world [on same-sex marriage],” Gifford says. “This is where you can be really proud that we've made significant strides. When you think back 10 years to when Howard Dean was running for president and he was in favor of civil unions, and that was so risky. And now — it's remarkable. This is true social progress. This is where you can give credit to the movement, because they did such a good job in humanizing the issue, in making it real for people, making it real for families. And it wasn't just an activist issue. It was broader than that.”
As U.S. ambassador to Denmark, Gifford's role includes serving the Arctic-region country of Greenland, prompting the ambassador to maintain an intimate knowledge of the broad, intersectional perspective his office demands. Regardless of the topic, Gifford moves through conversations with ease and intelligence, effectively addressing the cultural and economic divisions that distinguish the varied people he meets, often working seven days a week and well into many evenings.
His time in Denmark has also helped the ambassador appreciate aspects of the nation's infastructure that he believes the U.S. would do well to adopt. While some of Denmark's hallmark policies like universal health care, state-funded higher education, and strict gun laws would require a massive overhaul of long-embedded American institutions, Gifford points to more immediate opportunities for investment in sustainable energy and public infrastructure.
Denmark is one of the world's leaders in green and wind energy, supplying on a good day (that is, a windy day,) about 60 percent of the country's electrical power needs with wind energy and other sustainable sources. The nation's average sustainable energy output meets about a third of the country's electrical needs. In contrast, U.S. energy needs are met almost exclusively by the use of fossil fuels, with an estimated 5 to 6 percent coming from sustainable sources.
“So when I look at real compatibility between the United States and Denmark, I look at green energy and offshore wind,” says Gifford. “[I'm] looking for creative solutions to what I think is one of the world's greatest problems: how to create enough clean energy for the world's population in a responsible way.” The benefits are not just clean energy, Gifford says, but a real growth opportunity for business. “If you create offshore wind industries in the U.S., it creates jobs there.”
Gifford also points to the ubiquity of bikes and bike lanes in Copenhagen. “Copenhagen is built on bikes,” he says. “A couple of months ago we hosted delegations from Los Angeles and Seattle that came to study the city's bike lanes, just to see how their cities might be able to get more cars off the streets.”
While Gifford knows that L.A. will never be Copenhagen, his own experience advocating for novel strategies within the American political machine makes him optimistic that some of the progress he's seen in Denmark can be emulated in the U.S.
Gifford began his long service stateside in 2004, at age 29, as an unpaid intern for John Kerry's presidential campaign. That early involvement eventually led to Gifford being named finance director for the Democratic National Committee in 2009, and he ultimately raised more than $1.2 billion for President Obama's reelection campaign in 2012.
From this past experience and his current vantage point as the sitting ambassador in Denmark, Gifford knows that governments need to evolve to meet the conditions of a world connected through mobile phone apps and social media. “This means [changing] communication, the way we interact with people,” Gifford says. “That's what we're trying to do. And governments are always the last to come around.”
But officials at the U.S. Department of State are working to disprove that generalization, as several embassy staffers tell The Advocate that Ambassador Gifford — or Ambo, as he's fondly abbreviated — has been held up as an example to be emulated by senior members of the State Department, including now-Secretary of State John Kerry.
Alistair Thomson, a 19-year veteran of the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen, has seen several ambassadors come and go over the years, each bringing their own style and method in connecting with the Danes. But “there's just something special about Rufus Gifford,” says Thomson. “He's one of our bests.”
Noting that everyone at the embassy has seen his TV documentary series, Gifford says that he's just “following Obama's lead on this stuff,” pointing to the president's February video on BuzzFeed promoting the latest health care sign-up deadline. “That was a fantastic, huge success,” Gifford smiles, acknowledging that the viral pitch did prompt some criticism from Republicans. “But [Obama's team on that video] had a much bigger budget than we do.”
Press release - 16 March, 2016
Brussels, 16 March 2016 - Data released today by the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows a stalling of global energy-related CO2 emissions in 2015, for the second year in a row.
“Greenpeace welcomes this as a sign that national climate and renewable energy policies are working. World leaders now need to double down on making sure global temperature increase remains within the limits agreed in last year's Paris Agreement,” said Li Shuo, Greenpeace East Asia senior climate adviser.
The IEA points to declining coal use in China and significant renewable energy uptake in that country and other parts of the world as responsible for the plateau in global emissions growth. This provides renewed hope for avoiding the worst impacts of climate change.
“China's efforts to tackle climate change and local air pollution are paying global dividends,” said Li. “China's emissions may have peaked and are now falling for the second year in a row. This puts the country on track to surpass its Paris climate commitments, which is great news.”
Despite the Paris Agreement, however, climate ambitions in some countries continue to lag. While aiming to become the world leader in renewable energy, for example, Europe is the only region in the world that saw investments in renewable energy, particularly wind and solar, decline in the last five years [1].
“It's very encouraging to see energy-related CO2 emissions growth stall, but few steps have been taken to accelerate clean energy deployment so emissions start to decline,” said Greenpeace International Global Energy Strategist Emily Rochon.
“As we are witnessing alarming temperature increases, this is no time to sit back and enjoy the ride. World leaders in Paris agreed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C, which requires unprecedented efforts today, not tomorrow, to scale up renewable energy and reduce energy consumption globally."
The upcoming Paris agreement signatory event in New York on 22 April is a good moment for the European Union and others to signal their commitment to avoiding catastrophic climate change and the 1.5 degree C warming limit. Ban Ki-moon is asking heads of state to come to the event with new commitments for accelerating climate action by 2020.

Kristof To Clinton: What Does It Say That A Man Who Bragged About Sexual Assault Won The Presidency?
Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic party nominee for president, said misogyny was part of why she lost in an interview with Nicholas Kristof at the 'Women In The World' summit.
Clinton was asked what it says about the challenges that women face when "a man who bragged about sexual assault won the election." Kristof was referring to the current commander-in-chief, President Donald Trump.
From the event on Thursday:
NICHOLAS KRISTOF, NEW YORK TIMES: This is a women's empowerment conference. I have to ask fundamentally, a man who bragged about sexual assault won the election and won 53% of the white women's vote. What does that say about the challenges that one faces in women's empowerment, that in effect misogyny won with a lot of women voters?
HILLARY CLINTON: I don't know that there is one answer. I think in any campaign there are so many cross currents and events and have some greater impact than others. But it is fair to say as you just did that certainly, misogyny played a role.That just has to be admitted. And why and what the underlying reasons why is what I'm trying to parse out myself.

Several times in Japanese history , the new ruler sought to ensure his position by calling a sword hunt (刀狩, katanagari ) . Armies would scour the entire country, confiscating the weapons [a] of the enemies of the new regime. In this manner, the new ruler sought to ensure that no one could take the country by force as he had just done. The most famous sword hunt was ordered by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1588.
Prior to the sword hunt called by Oda Nobunaga towards the end of the 16th century, civilians were free to carry swords for defense or simply for decoration. Nobunaga sought an end to this, and ordered the seizure of swords and a variety of other weapons from civilians, in particular the Ikkō-ikki peasant-monk leagues which sought to overthrow samurai rule.
In 1588, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, having become kampaku or "imperial regent", ordered a new sword hunt; Hideyoshi, like Nobunaga, sought to solidify separations in the class structure, denying commoners weapons while allowing them to the nobility, the samurai class. In addition, Toyotomi's sword hunt, like Nobunaga's, was intended to prevent peasant uprisings and to deny weapons to his adversaries. This hunt may have been inspired by a peasant uprising in Higo the year prior, but also served to disarm the sōhei of Mount Kōya and Tōnomine. Toyotomi claimed that the confiscated weapons would be melted down and used to create a giant image of the Buddha for the Asuka-dera monastery in Nara.
"Taikō's Sword Hunt", as it came to be called, was accompanied by a number of other edicts, including the Expulsion Edict of 1590, by which Toyotomi sought to establish a census and expel from villages any newcomers who arrived in or after 1590. The chief goal of this was to place a check on the threat posed by rōnin, masterless wandering samurai who had the potential not only for crime and violence in general, but for banding together to overthrow Toyotomi rule. Hideyoshi, like most of this period, believed in rule by edict, paying little or no attention to legal principles.
While the Sword Hunt ostensibly succeeded in denying weapons to potential rebels, it also created discontent throughout the nation, increasing the number and passion of potential rebels.
Bantamweight Ahmet Kayretli boasts more than 200 fights in his combat sports career and has trained alongside the likes of former UFC champ Dominick Cruz and current top flyweight contender Wilson Reis. Now he hopes to join them on the UFC roster.
“I feel I was born with this mission to represent and win this belt for my people, and I've already dreamed it many times,” Kayretli told MMAjunkie. “I'm getting closer, and I hope (UFC matchmaker) Sean Shelby and (UFC President) Dana White pick me soon because I think I am currently the only pro MMA fighter from Turkey that is close to signing with UFC.”
The 27-year-old Kayretli has been competing in MMA since 2013, amassing a record of 6-1 in his first seven pro fights. But that mark doesn't quite convey his fighting pedigree, which includes hundreds of amateur kickboxing bouts.
“Actually, I'm very happy that I didn't go pro too soon and too fast because I was always better than my record due to the fact that I had a lot of amateur fight experience,” Kayretli said. “Also, there are not a lot of pro shows in Turkey, and it was not worth it to go pro and fight only once a year when I could fight 10 to 20 amateur fights a year because in Turkey, kickboxing is regulated by the Turkish government, and just like wrestling in the U.S., our national championship is pretty big.
“You have to win between five and eight fights – after you win the regional and state championships – and ultimately fight for your national team, and normally there is a money prize for the champions of each division in the end, so it was not ‘free-free' either.”
Kayretli (6-1) was eventually exposed to MMA and decided he wanted to try his hand at a new art. It's been a successful transition so far, and on Saturday, he fights for the Cage Fury Fighting Championships bantamweight title against three-time UFC veteran Nick Pace (7-3) at CFFC 63, which takes place at Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa in Atlantic City, N.J.
Kayretli believes it might provide his breakout opportunity.
“When I was young, I wanted to be a K-1 champion, but then I started watching UFC,” Kayretli said. “I fell in love with MMA, and I decided to come to the U.S. because MMA is banned in Turkey and I could not pursue it there, so I packed to come to Northern Virginia and joined Kaizen MMA team. They put me on the right path and helped me be where I am now and fighting for the CFFC world title, which is one of the top 10 MMA promotions in the world.
“Needless to say, I still love kickboxing, and I fought a couple of times in the U.S., and I am actually a World Muaythai Council titleholder in the U.S. Also, GLORY kickboxing promotion was interested in having me in their show, but they kept dragging their feet, and since I didn't want to lose my focus, I told them that I would rather pursue my MMA career and I moved on.”
Due to his striking prowess, Kayretli has been invited to other fighters' camps to serve as a training partner, and he says the experience – including training alongside Cruz to help emulate T.J. Dillashaw – has proven invaluable.
“I've been around a lot of UFC, Bellator, ONE Championship and WEC veterans but what I gained from training with someone who has the title in my weight class was confidence,” Kayretli said. “It was a way to evaluate myself better, and now I know I can be the future UFC champion at 135 pounds.”
But up first is Pace, who boasts four submissions in seven career wins and could provide a stiff test for Kayretli's striking-based game. Kayretli welcomes the challenge and believes he'll prove up to the task.
“First of all, I'm happy to fight a guy that already been in the UFC because if I beat him, then there is no question that I'm the next tough generation of MMA that is coming to take over,” Kayretli said. “I know how it feels to fight in that level of competition, too.
“I have fought in Lumpinee Stadium in Thailand. I have fought many big fights in Holland. I've wrestled with Olympic-level wrestlers and many, many Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belts since day one. So I'm ready for this challenge, and I don't think people will be surprised by my standup skills, but my wrestling and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is where I like to shine, as well.”
Kayretli believes he just needs one shot to make an impression, and he's hoping he earns it at CFFC 63.
“Like I said, I have dreamed many times that I have the UFC belt around my waist, and I feel I have a mission to make the Turkish nation proud,” Kayretli said. “I'm not going to stop until I see my dream in reality.”
Image caption The "battle bus" is expected to fetch more than £10,000 at auction
An armour-plated "battle bus", believed to have been used by former prime minister Margaret Thatcher in Northern Ireland, is to go under the hammer.
The 28-tonne bus was thought to have been built in the 1980s for a visit by Mrs Thatcher, before being used to transport troops, auctioneers said.
It has a blast-proof floor, armour-plated glass and was thought to be chemical, biological and nuclear-proof.
It is expected to fetch £10,000 in Towcester, Northamptonshire, next week.
Auctioneer Jonathan Humbert said the bus, which can hold 35 passengers, has just 28,000km (17,398 miles) on the clock and it has its own auxiliary generator and air supply in case anyone attacked it.
It also has a Foden chassis, a body by Glover and Webb and is powered by a 12-litre Rolls-Royce engine, Mr Humbert of JP Humbert Auctioneers said.
The sale comes from a private vendor who bought it from a research and development company, which in turn had bought it from the government.
"This isn't a good-looking vehicle by any stretch of the imagination - but is of social and historical interest," said Mr Humbert.
"It is an irreplaceable one-off, an iron bus for the Iron Lady."
The bus will go under the hammer on 21 February.
Sen. Thom Tillis Thomas (Thom) Roland TillisGOP Sen. Tillis to vote for resolution blocking Trump's emergency declaration The Hill's Morning Report — Emergency declaration to test GOP loyalty to Trump Don't look for House GOP to defy Trump on border wall MORE (R-N.C.) on Tuesday broke ranks with some in his party over the fight over to replace Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, saying Republicans should not be so quick to rule out any potential nominee that President Obama might put forth.
ThinkProgress. "I think we fall into the trap, if we just simply say sight unseen — we fall into the trap of being obstructionist," Tillis said in an interview on "The Tyler Cralle Show," as first reported by

Tillis called on Obama to nominate someone as conservative as Scalia, adding that he would not support a liberal nominee.
"If he puts forth someone that we think is in the mold of President Obama's vision for America, then we will use every device available to block that nomination, wait for the American people to voice their vote in November, and then move forward with the nomination after the election," Tillis said.
"Our concern, based on the actions of this president, is that he's going to put forth someone who is ideologically aligned with him, and I think that's out of step with the American people," he added.
"The American people‎ should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice," McConnell said. "Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President.”
Recently, there's been much debate over whether or not everyone should learn to code. Software engineer Yevgeniy Brikman says that this is the wrong question: there's a huge difference between learning programming and learning computer science, which is the more valuable skill.

Learning to code, he says, does have valuable benefits. You'll learn how to build apps and troubleshoot technology, and it can open career doors.
However, programming is just a very small part of computer science, and there are other ways to apply the broader computer science concepts to life.
Programming, or writing code, is how you instruct a computer to perform some operation. If you've never written code before, you're probably used to interacting with a computer by clicking on things in an existing app. Under the hood, this app consists of code that tells the computer how to display the application, where to store or retrieve data, and how to react to your clicks.
All programming is based on the principles of computer science...[It's] an essential part of learning computer science by applying the new way of thinking. However, by itself, programming is not nearly as general purpose.

Computer science, on the other hand, teaches you critical thinking skills that are useful in areas outside of technology; it's teaching you to process and represent information.
Brinkman explains the fine difference between programming and computer science with this analogy:
Now, just because a technology is ubiquitous doesn't mean you have to study it in school. For example, we all fly in airplanes, but getting your pilot's license is not part of the K-12 curriculum.
However, the tools you need to understand how to think about flying are part of the curriculum:
Physics and math help you understand gravity, forces, pressure, velocity, friction, and lift.
Biology teaches you what happens to the human body at high altitudes, with limited oxygen, and extreme cold.
History explains how the airplane was developed, how it evolved, and its role in travel, commerce, and warfare. By the time you graduate high school, you have an idea of what a plane is, how it works, and how to use it safely. General purpose classes like physics, math, biology, and history teach you how to think about a wide variety of topics, including airplanes; this is in contrast to a class that teaches you how to use a tool, such as how to fly one specific type of airplane. For the same reason, we should focus on teaching computer science and not just coding: the former is a general purpose way of thinking, whereas the latter is a specific tool.

Bill Kintner.
On Wednesday, Republican Nebraska State Senator Bill Kintner stepped down following criticism from both the public and fellow lawmakers over an offensive tweet he sent out the day after the Women's March.
Kintner retweeted a now-deleted tweet by Larry Elder, a conservative radio host. In it, three women are pictured holding signs referencing Donald Trump's “grab them by the pussy” comments; Elder's comment was “Ladies, I think you're safe.”
The now-removed tweet.
Following backlash, Kintner released this statement:‘“By retweeting a message, I was not implying support for putting women in fear of their personal safety. I took down the retweet as soon as I became aware that it was being misconstrued.”
He is not the only state senator to come under fire for posting about the Women's March: Indiana State Senator Jack Sandlin faced criticism after sharing a meme with a march photo and the words “In one day, Trump got more fat women walking than Michelle Obama did in eight years.”
Per the Lincoln Journal Star, Kintner's resignation came shortly before his colleagues were set to meet and consider his expulsion.
This was not the first instance of Kintner coming under scrutiny for inappropriate behavior. In 2016, he was embroiled in a scandal after using a state laptop to trade explicit messages and videos with a stranger. After he masturbated into a webcam, the woman threatened to post the video if he didn't pay her $4,500. He was eventually fined $1,000 for his illegal use of a state computer, and was urged to resign at the time.
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Reorg Research, the leading provider of real-time news, commentary, and analysis on the distressed debt and leveraged finance markets, welcomed a unanimous 5-0 decision from the First Department Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court finding that Reorg Research's editorial team is protected by New York's Shield Law from being compelled to disclose the identities of its confidential sources.
Kent Collier, Founder and CEO of Reorg Research, said, “We are extremely pleased by the court's decision. In this evolving media landscape, it sends a powerful message that journalistic freedom is important and worth protecting. I could not be prouder of our entire team here at Reorg, and I look forward to continuing to provide our subscribers with the very best news and analysis in the industry.”
The ruling was in response to a pre-action petition filed by Murray Energy seeking to force Reorg to divulge the identities of confidential sources who contributed to stories on Murray's financial results and an agreement between the company and one of its labor unions. While Murray had argued that Reorg's limited subscriber base, restrictions on further dissemination of its stories and relatively high fees precluded it from being protected by the Shield Law, the court found that such features are “not uncommon” in today's media landscape. The court added that the result of ruling in Murray's favor “is not broader coverage but no coverage at all.”
Not only did the court find that Reorg was protected by the Shield Law, but it also noted that the holding “is consistent with New York's ‘long tradition...of providing the utmost protection of freedom of the press'” and “[t]o condition coverage on a fact-intensive inquiry analyzing a publication's number of subscribers, subscription fees, and the extent to which it allows further dissemination of information is unworkable and would create substantial prospective uncertainty, leading to a potential ‘chilling' effect.”
The full ruling can be found here.

As the first day of Jian Ghomeshi's sex assault trial wrapped up, his defence lawyer Marie Henein had already pointed out several discrepancies in the first witness' testimony to police, media, and the court.
Overall, they were relatively minor: was she wearing hair extensions when he allegedly yanked her hair? In which direction was her hair being pulled? Was she kissing Ghomeshi before he allegedly pulled her hair or during? On Tuesday, she introduced a new question about whether or not the witness was "pushed," "pulled," or "thrown" to the ground during the assault in Ghomeshi's house—the answers appeared to vary in different interviews.
Then came the big reveal. Henein produced a series of bombshell emails that suggested the witness had made incorrect statements under oath when she claimed she cut off all communication with Ghomeshi after allegedly being punched in the head in his home.
Henein started out by establishing that the witness, whose identity is protected under publication ban, originally chose not to report Ghomeshi to police but instead "stay away" from him. She replayed a part of a recent police interview in which the woman said, "I didn't have any more dealings with him after that."
Henein outlined how "at least six times under oath" the witness told cops and the media that she didn't reach out to Ghomeshi after being allegedly assaulted in 2003, to the point where she turned off the TV and radio when he was on because it forced her to "relive the violence."
Then Henein paused, dramatically, asking, "Do you now want to tell his honour and the court the truth?" The witness responded that she had done so.
READ MORE: Day One of Jian Ghomeshi Trial Shows the Difficulty Faced By Alleged Victims of Sex Assaults
Henein presented the court with an email, dated January, 16, 2004, a year after the alleged assault took place. It was from the witness to Ghomeshi.
"Can I explain?" the witness interjected. But Henein carried on, going line by line through the email, which was sent at around 3 AM.
The subject read "Play>Boy" and opened with "Good to see you again!" followed by "Your show is still great."
The witness had included a link in the email to some kind of music video featuring herself and a friend. The email closed with, "If you want to keep in touch this is my email!!!!" and listed a phone number. (Ghomeshi never replied, according to the witness.)
"Are you prepared to admit you have lied under oath?" Henein asked the witness, to which she said, "I refuse."
The second email, sent in June 2004, opened with, "I've been watching you on 'Screw the Vote.'"
At this, the witness claimed that that was a lie and she'd never watched Ghomeshi on that show.
"I thought I'd drop you a line and say hello," it reads. "Hope all is well." Attached was a photo of the witness in a bikini.
The witness told the court she sent the emails to "bait" Ghomeshi.
"I wanted Jian to call me so I could ask him why did he violently punch me in the head," she said. "If reaching out to him like this was the only way to get it, that's the only way to get it."
The witness said she remembered drafting angry emails but couldn't remember sending them. Henein responded, "That is not an angry photo. It's a photo showing your entire body in a string bikini."
Her questions ended there. The witness left, her credibility undeniably damaged.

The oddsmakers installed Ohio State as a 22.5-point favorite heading into Saturday night's showdown with the Nebraska Cornhuskers in Lincoln's Memorial Stadium. Interestingly, while typing this post, at least one outlet moved the line to -24.5.
This marks the fourth-straight week the Buckeyes will take the field as heavy favorites.
Sitting at 5-1 on the season, the Buckeyes are currently 3-3 against the spread including a perfect 2-0 against the spread away from home.
Conversely, Nebraska enters with a 3-3 overall record including 2-4 against the spread (0-4 at home).
The Cornhuskers are coming off a 38-17 home loss to Wisconsin as Badger running back Jonathan Taylor shredded Big Red for 249 rushing yards and a pair of scores.
Meanwhile, Nebraska signal-caller Tanner Lee continued his struggles completing only 16 of 32 passes with a touchdown and a pick, good for a 45.5 QBR.
The Huskers found themselves in a 17-17 game early in the third quarter but the Badgers reeled off 21 unanswered points to seal the deal.
Ohio State and Nebraska are set for a 7:30 p.m. kickoff broadcast on FS1.
Her mother may be happy to see her face peeping out of newspaper pages but Anushka Sharma feels actors should retain a certain amount of mystery and enigma for their audiences.
The 27-year-old actress, who has cemented her position as a bankable star with the success of "PK" and "NH10", has been in the headlines recently be it her movie projects or her relationship with cricketer Virat Kohli.
"Actors are overexposed today. Everytime I open the newspaper, I see my face, I see myself on hoardings. It is overbearing to see myself so much. My mother is happy though. Till date, she gets excited to see my face in the newspaper. But, I feel a certain amount of mystery should remain with actors, there should be some enigma. You should go and experience them onscreen." Anushka said in an interview.
The audience will get to experience Anushka's performance in two back-to-back movies --Anurag Kashyap's "Bombay Velvet" and Zoya Akhtar's "Dil Dhadakne Do" -- releasing this Friday and on June 5.
"Bombay Velvet", where she is paired opposite Ranbir Kapoor for the first time, will see Anushka in an "internalised" role, quite opposite to her chirpy image.
"Every actor has a certain energy which suits certain roles better. I was surprised when he offered me this in 2011. It was scary to control one's natural instinct and find another route to approach the part. It is a very internalised performance. Rosie does not say much in the movie. She expresses herself only through her songs," said Anushka.
It is the first time that Anushka is working with Ranbir and she is happy that their first film together is "Bombay Velvet".
"I would not want any other film to be our first film together because it is so different from everyone's perception. It is a very strong love story and I can't see anyone else doing Johnny's role because Ranbir is so good in it. We next have a quintessential love story in Karan Johar's 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil'."
Johar, meanwhile, is sharing screen space with the duo as an actor in the period drama. He plays the main antagonist Kaizad Khambatta in the movie to Anushka's Rosie Noronha and Ranbir's Balraj.
"I don't have many scenes with Karan but he has done great in the movie," she said.
The actress credits her instincts in selecting good projects.
"I follow my instincts in selecting roles. In the first few years, I would pick the best from what I was being offered. This is why I did fewer films. But now I am in a better position to make good choices. Luckily, my choices have turned out to be good," she said.
The actress, who starred and produced a gritty story like "NH10", said she was discouraged about it.
"More than the money, it is the faith that you put in a project against all odds. People are dissuading you for various reasons but you make it purely on a creative level without trying to make everyone happy, which happens a lot here. It was difficult but not walking the beaten path was a big kick."
Look Inside
Over the last week I've been trying to learn about HTML5 Drag and Drop (DnD) File Upload using Drag and Drop API combined with HTML5 File API. Drag and Drop API enables browsers to receive local files from user desktop just by ‘drag‘ and then ‘drop‘. While HTML5 File API enables JavaScript to interact with selected local files before upload to the server. With both of them, we can build a drag and drop file upload interface.
I've created an example of HTML5 drag and drop file upload with the capabilities to resize, crop or reformat/filter the uploaded image through HTML5 canvas before sending to the server. The techniques included are:
You could check out the working demo through the link up there. Have fun with this HTML5 drag and drop file upload with canvas!
[browser type=”cfs-x”]This working demo only works in browsers that support HTML5 File API as well as Drag and Drop API.[/browser]
The HTML Markup
The demo consists of two major parts, an area for drag and drop as well as the upload preview part. The idea is to capture the files uploaded by user whether through drag and drop area or browse button, and then display it in the preview section before upload to the server.
<!-- drop area --> <div id="droparea"> <div class="dropareainner"> <p class="dropfiletext">Drop files here</p> <p>or</p> <p><input id="uploadbtn" type="button" value="Select Files"/></p> <!-- extra feature --> <p id="err"><!-- error message --></p> </div> <input id="upload" type="file" multiple /> </div> <!-- result area --> <div id="result"></div>
Also, we will use jQuery Template to create image preview wrapper which contains preview of uploaded image, image name, original image size, and final size of image that will upload to the server.
<script id="imageTemplate" type="text/x-jquery-tmpl"> <div class="imageholder"> <figure> <img src="${filePath}" alt="${fileName}"/> <figcaption> ${fileName} <br/> <span>Original Size: ${fileOriSize} KB</span> <br/> <span>Upload Size: ${fileUploadSize} KB</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div> </script>
Events Binding
Now, let's get our hand dirty with some jQuery coding. The first thing that we are going to do is to bind the Drag and Drop events to our #droparea element. There are a number of drag events, but we will use only dragover , dragleave , and drop events.
var dropzone = $('#droparea'); dropzone.on('dragover', function() { //add hover class when drag over dropzone.addClass('hover'); return false; }); dropzone.on('dragleave', function() { //remove hover class when drag out dropzone.removeClass('hover'); return false; }); dropzone.on('drop', function(e) { //prevent browser from open the file when drop off e.stopPropagation(); e.preventDefault(); dropzone.removeClass('hover'); //retrieve uploaded files data var files = e.originalEvent.dataTransfer.files; processFiles(files); return false; });
dataTransfer.files will return a FileList of the files being dragged.
Not only drag and drop area, instead we will create a ‘browse' button as well. But we don't want to use native browser file upload button, so here is a little trick for this.
var uploadBtn = $('#uploadbtn'); var defaultUploadBtn = $('#upload'); uploadBtn.on('click', function(e) { e.stopPropagation(); e.preventDefault(); //trigger default file upload button defaultUploadBtn.click(); }); defaultUploadBtn.on('change', function() { //retrieve selected uploaded files data var files = $(this)[0].files; processFiles(files); return false; });
The best practice of using new HTML5 objects is to check for object availability before using it, else simply skips the function or show a fallback plan if any.
function processFiles(files) { //check for browser support if(files && typeof FileReader !== "undefined") { //extract FileList as File object for(var i=0; i<files.length; i++) { readFile(files[i]); } } else { //some message or fallback } }
Each File object contains properties like name , size , and type .
The FileReader Object
Next, we will read the content of uploaded file through FileReader object which allows browser asynchronously to read files from user desktop.
var readFile = function(file) { if( (/image/i).test(file.type) ) { //define FileReader object var reader = new FileReader(); //init reader onload event handlers reader.onload = function(e) { var image = $('<img/>') .load(function() { //get new image URL from canvas image var newimageurl = getCanvasImage(this); //create preview using jQuery Template createPreview(file, newimageurl); //upload the new image to server uploadToServer(newimage, imageObj); }) .attr('src', e.target.result); }; //begin reader read operation reader.readAsDataURL(file); } else { //some message for wrong file format } }
Once the reader is loaded, we can bind the uploaded image (in Base64-encoded) to <img> tag through e.target.result . After that, we will use it to draw a canvas image so that we can modify it with JavaScript before proceed to the server. This definitely will save the bandwidth compare to process it at server side.
Canvas Image
We can resize the image as well as apply different filters to our canvas image. However I won't cover them here, still, you can grab them from the source files. When the canvas image was drawn, convert it to file URL format through toDataURL method and attach it to jQuery Template.
var getCanvasImage = function(image) { var imgWidth = 180, imgHeight = 180; //define canvas image var canvas = document.createElement('canvas'); canvas.width = imgWidth; canvas.height = imgHeight; var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d'); ctx.drawImage(image, imgWidth, imgHeight); //convert canvas to jpeg URL return canvas.toDataURL("image/jpeg"); }
jQuery Template
When we have everything we need, simply bind them to jQuery Template and append to our #result element.
var createPreview = function(file, newURL) { //populate jQuery Template binding object var imageObj = {}; imageObj.filePath = newURL; imageObj.fileName = file.name.substr(0, file.name.lastIndexOf('.')); //subtract file extension imageObj.fileOriSize = convertToKBytes(file.size); imageObj.fileUploadSize = convertToKBytes(dataURItoBlob(newURL).size); //convert new image URL to blob to get file.size //append new image through jQuery Template var img = $("#imageTemplate").tmpl(imageObj).prependTo("#result"); }
There is a need of converting newURL (in DataURI format) to Blob so that we can access it's attributes like file size or file type whether from client side or server side.
For dataURItoBlob function, you might found them in script.js file inside source files.
Upload To Server
Last but not least, we can upload the new image to our server through jQuery AJAX .
var uploadToServer = function(oldFile, newFile) { // prepare FormData var formData = new FormData(); //we still have to use back some old file data //since new file doesn't contain original file data formData.append("filename", oldFile.name); formData.append("filetype", oldFile.type); formData.append("file", newFile); //submit formData using $.ajax $.ajax({ url: "upload.php", type: "POST", data: formData, processData: false, contentType: false, success: function(data) { //some success code here } }); }
The File Upload PHP Script
Though this is not a complete PHP upload script, but hope this will help you get to know how it works inside the back end code.
if(isset($_FILES['file'])) { if(move_uploaded_file($_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"], "upload/".$_POST["filename"])) { echo 'Upload Success'; } else { echo '#Fail'; } }

You learn something new every day. On RTÉ Radio's The John Murray Show on Wednesday, stand-in host Kathryn Thomas opened up to her listeners. “I love a long shower,” she said, during a segment on the forthcoming water charges.
Thomas's studio guest, ecologist Duncan Stewart, warned her: “I tell you, I'm going to shock you with showers.”
And he did, kind of.
Stewart explained that an ecological shower uses about nine litres of water in three minutes and costs a fairly reasonable 4.5 cent, given water will cost almost half a cent per litre under the new charging regime.
The teen factor
A less ecological power shower uses about 17 litres per minute and generally lasts about 10 minutes when a teenager is involved. Stewart said teens like their showers hot, at about 45 degrees, and the routine was likely to cost €2.50 a go, which works out at more than €900 per year for one teen.
When contacted, Stewart put flesh on the bones of his statistic. He said the required water would cost about 82.96 cent (170 litres x 0.488 cent), and most of the expense arises from heating enough water to keep the shower pumping at a rate of 17 litres of hot water for 10 minutes.
Using Electric Ireland's online appliance calculator, a large immersion heater (capacity 210 litres) would need to be emptied 5.67 times per week to meet the demand (170 litres x 7) and would cost €128.66 every two months or €2.14 per day – bringing the average cost of a 10-minute teen power shower to just under €2.97 or €1,084.05 per year.
A daily shower using 170 litres would account for 62,050 litres annually, which means showers for one person would use more than double the free allowance offered by Irish Water to cover a household for a year. The additional 21,000 litre allowance for under-18s would be a drop in the ocean.
Electric showers
There is, however, an important distinction to be made between a power shower and an electric shower.
Simon McFetridge, of Dublin shower installation and repair firm Aquashowers, said six in 10 properties he visited had an electric shower, with the Triton T90 the model he encountered most often.
On average, about two in 10 properties had a power shower, he said, but some households were moving away from them before the water charges come in.
The T90, McFetridge said, pumps at an average rate of some seven litres per minute, or 70 litres for a 10-minute shower, which would cost 34.16 cent.
Again using Electric Ireland's calculator, an electric shower at a power rating of 8.5kw (as is the case with the Triton T90) for 10 minutes a day costs €15.43 every two months, or about 26 cent a day – bringing the cost of your 10-minute shower to 60.16 cent, or €219.58 per year.
Teenagers aside, a study of the showering habits of 100 families over a 10-day period (or 2,600 showers) by multinational consumer goods firm Unilever found that the average shower lasted for eight minutes and used 62 litres of water – which would cost 50.2 cent.
Perhaps it's not just teenagers who are going to have to change their habits when the water bills start to arrive.
Australia's preparations for the ICC World T20 have been given a boost with Nathan Coulter-Nile making a successful return to action following a shoulder injury.
Coulter-Nile, who hasn't played since dislocating his shoulder on December 21, bowled 12 overs in WA Premier Cricket on Saturday, finishing with figures of 1-37 for club side Subiaco Floreat.
The 28-year-old bowled three four-over spells and reported "no issues" with his shoulder after play.
Scorecard: Coulter-Nile impresses in Premier Cricket
"It's the most overs I've bowled all year so it's fairly positive," Coulter-Nile told News Corp.
"Rhythm's a bit of an issue, but that will come with more bowling.
"I literally wasn't able to do anything (when I was injured).
"I haven't been able to work on bowling or fielding or even catching, I've literally been in the gym.
"My cricket skills are down a little bit but I picked it up pretty quick out there."
WATCH: Coulter-Nile injures shoulder in BBL clash
Coulter-Nile is now expected to play the opening two days of Western Australia's Sheffield Shield match against Queensland, starting on Thursday.
Should the 28-year-old come through the Shield match unscathed, he will head to South Africa with Australia's squad for a three-game series against the Proteas early next month.
National Selector Rod Marsh said earlier this month it was hoped that Coulter-Nile and fellow injured World T20 squad members Aaron Finch and James Faulkner would turn out for their Shield teams this week to prove their fitness before heading to South Africa. Tasmania host Victoria at Blundstone Arena, also starting on Thursday.
Quick Single: Good news for Australia's injured quartet
Coulter-Nile fielded at first slip on Saturday, taking one catch, and expects his fielding and bowling workload to increase over the coming weeks.
Plenty of surprises in Australia's World T20 squad
"I doubt there will be long spells, I never bowl long spells anyway so probably four or five over bursts," Coulter-Nile said of his expected workload in the Shield game.
"The shoulder feels all right, there were no issues.
"I'll have to start fielding with a bit more intensity before the Shield game, but I'm sure that will come."
Lionel Racing Announces Best-Selling Die-Cast of 2015
Earnhardt and Gordon dominate, while Elliott makes his debut
CONCORD, NC (December 16, 2015) – Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Jeff Gordon didn't just have the top two die-cast cars of the year, they dominated the list of best-selling cars which was unveiled today by Lionel Racing – The Official Die-Cast of NASCAR.
“Since we began publishing our top 10 list in 2011, we haven't seen such a dominant performance by two drivers as we have this year,” said Howard Hitchcock, President of Lionel Racing. “Their sales numbers are a testament to their impact on the sport and their ability to connect with the most passionate NASCAR fans – our collectors – in a big way.”
Earnhardt's new primary paint scheme drove sales of his No. 88 Nationwide Insurance die-cast to the top spot, while Gordon's wildly popular throwback, the No. 24 Axalta Rainbow Chevrolet, was the company's second biggest seller.
“We knew when the Axalta Rainbow car was first announced that this would be one of the most important die-cast of the year to longtime fans of the sport,” Hitchcock said. “I think we were just as thrilled as Gordon's fans were to see this iconic paint scheme on track in his final year of competition.”
The only driver to make the Lionel Racing list that wasn't named Earnhardt or Gordon was Chase Elliott. Elliott's No. 25 NAPA Chevrolet SS die-cast ranked a solid sixth.
“Elliott's popularity with NASCAR fans is incredibly impressive when you consider he has competed in the sport for just two years,” Hitchcock said. “That fan appeal is directly reflected in his sales numbers – his Cup debut car outsold several of our historically best-selling drivers.”
The 2015 Top 10 list is below. For more about this list, car images, and also the best-selling race win die-cast, special paint schemes, and overall driver performance, visit www.lioneltop10.com.

The Welcome Collection in central London is holding an exhibit and show of “Quacks and Cures” – exploring quaint quack remedies of the past. You can watch a slideshow presentation here.
I find discussions of curious cures from the past particularly interesting these days as it always strikes me how little has changed. This show is another example of how people can marvel at the naivete of the public a century or more ago in the face of obvious patent medicine scams or bizarre medical treatments – and yet they are really no different than much alternative medicine and supplement industry claims of today.
The only thing that has changed, slightly, is the particulars of the marketing – the slogans and catch-phrases that were common. The advertisement for Parker's Tonic asks, “Are you weary in brain and body?” and claims to work by “rejuvenating the blood.” This is actually less bizarre than therapeutic touch practitioners claiming to strengthen your human energy field.
Many remedies were sold through testimonials, especially from famous people or royalty. In the UK there is actually a continuous tradition of royalty lending their prestige to dubious remedies. Prince Charles is hawking his Duchy Original Detox Tincture – you can't get more of a vibe of old patent medicine than that.
And of course the use of testimonials is key – you can find testimonials to support any product or claim that you wish. They are useful only for marketing.
The slide show depicts, “Baldwin's Herbal Tonic Mixture, Nature's general restorer of the system and purifier of the blood.” That is just slightly off of modern herbal products claiming to naturally detoxify the body. And yet it is acceptable to call Baldwin's Tonic an example of a quack patent remedy, while modern hawkers of the same con have managed to convince much of the public that it is closed-minded and impolite to do so regarding it's contemporary equivalent.
We also see electrical and magnetic quack devices – another theme that seems to recur with regularity in the quack medical device industry. Harness' Electropathic Belts are “scientifically constructed,” and you can have a free consultation at the “Electropathic and Zander Institute” to treat your weakness. Wow – that can pass for an absolutely contemporary CAM clinic.
We also see a practitioner of “metallic tractors” which drew out “noxious substances” by “magnetic means.” This is a sort of combination of detox pads and magnetic bracelets. Very nice.
The exhibit will feature on this Friday, July 10th, not only shows (including a patent medicine show) but also lectures. Ben Goldacre will be lecturing on the placebo effect. This is awesome, and makes me wonder if the exhibiters get it – do they appreciate the fact that by showing quack remedies from the past and exposing how they were marketed, they are taking a swipe at their modern equivalent?
Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it – this is true enough in this case. There is much to learn from dubious remedies of the past. They teach us that millions can swear by treatments that we now know to be fraudulent and worthless, even harmful. We can see how such remedies are marketed with vague but pleasing slogans, how testimonials are used to deceive, and see that the themes which may seem new today (natural, detox, etc.) were old a century ago.
Does the building you live in have five or more residential units? Does your building not offer recycling? If you answered “yes” to both of these questions, your building is not complying with the Chicago High Density Residential and Commercial Source Reduction and Recycling Ordinance, a 1993 city ordinance that requires multi-residential building owners, governing associations, and/or condominium boards to provide their residents with an effective recycling program. The city gave these properties until 1995 to institute a recycling program or potentially face daily fines from $25 to $100.
The rationale behind Chicago's multi-unit recycling ordinance was that multi-residential buildings were already required to arrange garbage pickup. Yet in order to provide recycling services to tenants, landlords in multi-unit buildings must contract with a private recycling hauler, costing extra money on top of the solid waste disposal fees they already pay. Due to this expense, and the infrequency of the ordinance's enforcement, many multi-residential building owners opt not to provide recycling services to their tenants.
This led Claire Micklin, Ben Wilhelm and Alex Kahn to create MyBuildingDoesntRecycle.com, a website that allows Chicago's multi-unit renters to report their building as not offering recycling. Micklin, who lives in Edgewater, has been a Chicago resident since 2003 and says she has never had recycling in any of her multi-unit apartment buildings.
Micklin said her hope for the site is that it will move the city to enforce the ordinance. “After that I hope that the city will rewrite the ordinance with stronger language. In order for the city to enforce the recycling law, they need to hire staff that can inspect the buildings to be sure that buildings are in compliance. Cities with more successful recycling programs have staff dedicated to this function. The cities with the most successful recycling programs … are those that enforce their recycling laws,” Micklin said.
Other cities, such as Portland and San Francisco, offer composting and the recycling of clothing, while the lack of enforcement of Chicago's recycling ordinance leaves some residents unable to recycle even glass and newspaper. “The lack of recycling services to certain Chicago residents is a detriment to the environment for all Illinoisans,” said Jennifer Walling, executive director of the Illinois Environmental Council and Recycling co-chair at Edgewater Environmental Sustainability Project. “These services should be universally available and we should start thinking about diverting even more trash through composting services.”
Interestingly, even in buildings that do offer recycling, management may still be in non-compliance with the ordinance, which also requires that a written recycling plan be maintained and made available to residents for every residential building. According to recent coverage in The Chicago Tribune, the office of Mayor Rahm Emanuel has stated that the Department of Streets and Sanitation will begin sending letters to residential buildings “that do not appear to have a recycling plan.”
The letter will explain that the law requires them to offer recycling to their residents and will offer a phone number to call with questions.
In the end, Micklin said, “Chicago needs to make it easier for buildings to recycle … there needs to be a system in place that can educate buildings about compliance with the law, help make recycling attractive (perhaps work with private recycling haulers to make recycling cheaper than trash service), and help residents understand how to recycle correctly.”
Florida Governor Rick Scott. (Photo: Gage Skidmore / Flickr)On Thursday, the Justice Department demanded Florida Governor Rick Scott end his extensive purge of registered voters from the rolls because it was in violation of federal law. Scott still hasn't formally responded but his county election supervisors have already taken action.
The Palm Beach Post reports:
Florida elections supervisors said Friday they will discontinue a state-directed effort to remove names from county voter rolls because they believe the state data is flawed and because the U.S. Department of Justice has said the process violates federal voting laws...
The Justice Department letter and mistakes that the 67 county elections supervisors have found in the state list make the scrub undoable, said Martin County Elections Supervisor Vicki Davis, president of the Florida State Association of Supervisors of Elections…
Ron Labasky, the association's general counsel, sent a memo to the 67 supervisors Friday telling them to stop processing the list.
“I recommend that Supervisors of Elections cease any further action until the issues raised by the Department of Justice are resolved between the parties or by a Court,” Labasky wrote.
We knew it was bad, but not this bad.
Rents in New York City have skyrocketed over the past decade while New Yorkers' incomes have fallen, creating a dearth of affordable housing for the people that need it most. That's the takeaway from a disheartening report released by city Comptroller Scott Stringer this week. “Some of the data is obviously chilling,” Stringer told The New York Observer.
For example, while the median rent in New York City rose 75 percent between 2000 and 2012-- an increase 30 percent higher than in the rest of the country-- the median household income in the city fell about 5 percent. This has created a dire situation for those in the lower income brackets.
"Although most New Yorkers probably feel that housing in the city is too expensive, it is primarily those earning under $40,000 who literally may not be able to find an apartment they can afford," reads the report. In 2012, those making between $20,000 and $40,000 a year spent 44 percent of their income on rent. According to federal guidelines, "Families who pay more than 30 percent of their income for housing are considered cost burdened and may have difficulty affording necessities such as food, clothing, transportation and medical care."
Stringer called on Mayor Bill de Blasio to tackle this affordable housing crisis. The mayor pledged during his campaign to bring 200,000 new affordable housing units to the city. He's expected to announce his plan to do so in May.
Here are six terrifying charts that show precisely how unaffordable New York has become.
PRINEVILLE, OREGON, IS home to only about 10,000 people but to hundreds of thousands of servers. In January 2010 Facebook decided to build a huge data centre on a 124-acre plot in the high, juniper-pocked desert east of the Cascade mountains. The first building is as long as an aircraft carrier. A second, nearing completion, is slightly bigger.
Facebook is not alone. Bulldozers are chugging away on a 160-acre site nearby, digging for Apple. The iCloud will be housed here, in far-from-nebulous concrete and metal. The state boasts a growing collection of such centres (see map). Google landed farther north, in The Dalles. Amazon is in Boardman, on the Columbia river, which marks the border with Washington state. Rackspace, a fast-growing keeper of other companies' data, is planning a facility in the same town. A group of smaller centres is clustered around Portland.

The internet, as Andrew Blum vividly describes in his book, “Tubes”, published this year, is a physical entity. Mr Blum, a journalist with Wired, a technology magazine, traced his way through the internet, from the wire that goes out of the wall of his house, along the street and thence through fibre-optic cables, into exchanges where network operators' cables meet, through routers and switches, to data centres (including Facebook's and Google's in Oregon) and back home again.
All this equipment has to be kept somewhere. And as Mr Blum shows for several different types of kit, once one big company installs a load of equipment, for whatever reason, others are likely to be drawn to the same place.
The amount of data being generated is growing at an eye-popping pace: IBM estimates that 2.5 quintillion bytes are being created every day and that 90% of the world's stock of data is less than two years old. A growing share of these data is being kept not on desktops but in data centres—buildings containing rack after rack of computers.
Even in the age of superfast fibre-optic cables, companies do not like their data to travel too far. “Concern about latency [delay] used to be the privilege of big corporates, but it has started to matter again for a certain number of applications,” says Vivek Badrinath, chief executive of Orange Business Services, the enterprise arm of France Telecom-Orange. Companies with salesmen on the road, for instance, want orders to be entered and processed at once. His data centres are at most 150 milliseconds away from any big city. Distance is not dead; but it is measured in time not space.
Some data, such as financial and medical information, are more sensitive than others. There are regulations and strict certification of the conditions in which they can be kept. At BendBroadband, about 30 miles from Prineville, the main customers of a new centre that opened last year are health-care and financial institutions.
Awesome Oregon
Many companies rent space in shared (or “co-location”) centres belonging to companies such as Rackspace or BendBroadband. Some, such as Amazon or Google, are big enough to build their own. Facebook too has outgrown co-location. It had been renting space in California and Virginia, but needed sites of its own. It wanted one in the western states, to serve users on that side of the country and with good connections to Asia. It is also building centres in the east, in Forest City, North Carolina (a state that also plays host to Apple, Google and others), and in Europe, at Lulea, in northern Sweden. But why did it choose a little town in the Oregonian desert, miles from anywhere?
Jay Park, who runs the company's design, construction and operations teams for data centres, says Prineville is the “ideal location for the evaporative cooling system” that Facebook uses. Data centres are power-hungry beasts. Energy accounts for much of their operating cost, both to supply the servers and to cool them. Most contain a water-chiller which cools the air in the server rooms, consuming lots of energy.
Facebook, though, cools its centres with the dry (and often chilly) desert air, which enters a chamber on the roof of the building and is mixed with warm air recycled from the server room—a little in summer, a lot in winter. After passing through two sets of filters, the air is misted with high-pressure water sprays, then pulled through an array of fans. From there it drops into an aisle in the server hall where a perforated metal plate slows it down and helps distribute it around the server racks. Warm air is returned to the mixing chamber where the process began and used to heat offices if the weather is cold or expelled from the building if it is hot. The centre's design also contains other elements intended to keep energy costs down. All in all, Facebook gets a lot of cooling in Prineville for nothing.
But the weather was not the only reason for coming. The town is close to the main carriers' fibre routes, and connections to Asia, via Portland, are good too. When Facebook first arrived, the site was only about half a mile from high-voltage electricity lines running from Washington to California, although the company has since had to add a longer spur, adding to its costs. Labour was available both to build the centre and to run it.
Another big reason, perhaps as important as the climate, was tax. Oregon is one of only five states with no sales tax. “You replace a server every three years and a server costs a lot, so sales tax is a big deal,” says Mr Park. Electricity can be cheaper elsewhere, but Mr Park reckons that “the power rate is easier to change than the tax law.” In Washington state, which also has a cluster of data centres (Microsoft, among others, is at Quincy), legislators have been willing to make deals with inward investors, but in Oregon there is no need for special arrangements.
The other main incentive is a concession on property taxes. In rural enterprise zones, which include Boardman and The Dalles as well as Prineville, investments are exempt from these for up to 15 years provided that they create at least 35 jobs and wages are at least 50% above the local average.
In damper western Oregon, John Sheputis, chief executive of Fortune Data Centers, a co-location operator based in San Jose, has just opened a data centre at Hillsboro, near Portland. Hillsboro may not have a desert climate, but it has bags of infrastructure. Fortune's site is a stone's throw from a huge Intel semiconductor factory, which brought with it a plentiful, reliable (and pretty green) power supply. It also attracted contractors that specialise in building “mission-critical” facilities such as data centres, which need to operate around the clock without fail. The risk of lightning, the biggest cause of power cuts, is low. Hillsboro sits on top of the main domestic and transpacific fibre networks. And it is near Portland's busy airport, making it easy for Mr Sheputis's tenants to visit.
Again, the absence of sales tax counts for a lot; and in urban western Oregon, Mr Sheputis needed to create only one new job to be exempt from property tax. Without its tax system, he says, the state “wouldn't be as compelling”. With it? Given the same rents, even if power were free in California, he reckons he would still be better off in Oregon. “If you're west of the Mississippi and you're not in Oregon, you're paying too much,” he says.
In a new study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, researchers asked college students and police officers to estimate the ages of young children who they were told had committed a crime (both misdemeanors and felonies). In both groups, respondents were far more likely to overestimate the ages of young black boys than young white boys; they were also less likely to view black children as innocent.
"Children in most societies are considered to be in a distinct group with characteristics such as innocence and the need for protection," study author and professor of psychology at UCLA Phillip Atiba Goff said of the study. "Our research found that black boys can be seen as responsible for their actions at an age when white boys still benefit from the assumption that children are essentially innocent."

The goal of the study, according to researchers, was to determine the extent to which respondents dehumanized young black children, and how this racist dehumanization can lead to violence and unjust treatment. "[I]f human childhood affords protections against harsh, adult-like treatment, then in contexts where these children are dehumanized, they can be treated with adult severity" -- specifically in the criminal justice system, researchers wrote.
As Philip Bump at the Wire notes, college students tended to overestimate the ages of young boys who were presented as having committed a felony by 4.53 years, meaning that 13 and 14 year old children were determined by respondents to be legal adults. Police officers tended overestimate these boys' ages by 4.59 years. Overall, researchers note, participants viewed black children aged 10 and older than "significantly less innocent than other children of every age group."
There was also a correlation between the police officers' responses and their record of using force against people suspected of a crime, specifically young black boys, though Goff noted that "future research should try to clarify the relationship between dehumanization and racial disparities in police use of force."
The research is a disturbing snapshot of racism in America and its consequences for black children. "Most children are allowed to be innocent until adulthood," researchers wrote, "black children may be perceived as innocent only until deemed suspicious."
"The evidence shows that perceptions of the essential nature of children can be affected by race, and for black children, this can mean they lose the protection afforded by assumed childhood innocence well before they become adults," said co-author Matthew Jackson. "With the average age overestimation for black boys exceeding four-and-a-half years, in some cases, black children may be viewed as adults when they are just 13 years old."
SEATTLE – Police arrested a woman after they say she threw cat poop, frozen chicken parts and a green liquid at runners participating in the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure Sunday.
Officers working in the area of the run Sunday morning around 9:30 a.m. reported seeing a hail of garbage fall from a fifth story apartment in the 2100 block of 2nd Avenue in downtown Seattle.
Police said a runner in his 60s using a walker was hit with green liquid. A 13-year-old girl was hit with a frozen chicken breast, which left a welt on her skin.
Officers found a bag filled with refuse including 5 to 10 pounds of used kitty litter.
Police knocked on the door of the apartment where they believed the trash had been thrown and initially the woman inside refused to answer the door. Eventually however police said the woman told them she had worked a long shift and was angry at the runners who had woken her from sleep.
Police also asked what the green liquid covering the man in the walker was and the woman reportedly said it was “superfood”- a natural drink.
The unidentified woman was arrested and could face assault charges.
Going To College May Cost You, But So Will Skipping It

In America, total student loan debt tops $1 trillion and a four-year college degree can cost as much as a house — leaving many families wondering if college is really worth the cost.
Yes, a new study of young people finds. The study, released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center, looks at income and unemployment among young adults. Paul Taylor, executive vice president of special projects at Pew, says it's pretty much case closed when it comes to the benefits of going to college.
"In a modern, knowledge-based economy, the only thing more expensive than going to college is not going to college," he says.
College-educated young adults make more Notes "Full time" is defined as working at least 35 hours per week. Median annual earnings are based on earnings and work status during the year prior to interview (reflected in parentheses) and are limited to people who worked full time during the previous calendar year and reported positive earnings.
Here are the numbers: Those with a college degree now make $17,500 more per year than those without — a wage gap that's doubled in recent decades. Those without a degree are four times more likely to be unemployed.
One can imagine a college-educated barista, struggling with loan payments, having second thoughts about her college debt. But Pew surveyed young people, and "you ask them was it worth it, and boy, even those with debt — 8 out of 10 — say absolutely," Taylor says. "Either it's already worth it or it will be worth it."
Dakota Goforth, 19, is a freshman at the University of the District of Columbia. At first, he did not plan on college. After all, neither of his parents went and they make a fine living — his dad in special education, his mom as an accountant. But Goforth says the staff at his high school worked hard to drive home the income disparity that the Pew report chronicles.
"They would show you statistics of people who didn't go to college and people who did. And once I saw the numbers I'm like, yeah I'm going," Goforth says. "In this generation you have to go to college. Like, it isn't even optional."
But Pew also finds that it's not just going to college that matters — it's what you study while you're there. UDC student Michael Benton, 29, says he already has a master's degree. But like nearly one-third of those whom Pew surveyed, he says he regrets his major.
His study of political science, international relations and international development, he says, has offered "very little" in the way of job opportunities. So Benton is now working on a second bachelor's degree, taking out loans and dipping into savings to major in computer science.
"I want to be in a field where it's growing and I know what the future looks like, and I think the future's bright," he says with a laugh.
But how much more continues to increase The difference in median annual earnings of college and high school graduates when members of each generation were between 25 and 32, in 2012 dollars.
Compared with those without a degree, grads today are much better off. But how about compared with their parents? About one-third of millennials have college degrees — the most-educated generation ever. But as a group, they're not doing better, incomewise, than their parents' generation.
"There's no great sense of forward progress among this group, vis-a-vis college-educated young adults 10, 15, 20, 30 years ago," Pew's Taylor says. Pew finds the wage gap is widening at the lower end of education. Prospects for those with just a high school diploma have been collapsing since the late 1970s.
"The blue collar jobs of yesteryear, which built the American middle class — those jobs have simply disappeared," says Arne Kalleberg, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina and author of Good Jobs, Bad Jobs.
"The kinds of jobs that are being created are relatively low-wage, low-skill jobs, such as fast food and big-box stores," he says. "And so for most Americans, we've seen a stagnation in wages and a decline in purchasing powers."
So there's more incentive now than ever to go to college. Still, Kalleberg cautions that college alone does not guarantee a well-paying job. What you major in does matter, he says. And, of course, you have to be able to pay for it.

For decades, a soldier's lost limb meant a life confined to a wheelchair or crutches, and at the very least a discharge from active service. But an increasing number of injuries in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, while horrific, have led by necessity to advancements in prosthetics technology. In fact, some amputee service members have been able to remain on active duty, thanks to the experience earned by their doctors.
According to the Army, at least 167 soldiers who have had a major limb amputation (complete loss of an arm, leg, hand, or foot) have remained on active duty since the start of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, with some returning to battle. Many others have returned overseas to work in support roles behind the lines.
"When we have someone we know wants to return, their rehab is geared that way," says John Fergason, chief of prosthetics at the Army Center for the Intrepid at Fort Sam in Houston, Texas.
Kevin Carroll, vice president of Prosthetics at Hanger, a company that makes artificial limbs, says prosthetics have become more comfortable to wear and closer in range of motion to natural limbs.
"Unfortunately, when you have war, you have casualties, but with that comes innovation," he says. Artificial joints are getting better at approximating the knee, elbow, wrist, and ankle, and microprocessors embedded in prostheses are able to pick up and adjust for impacts from walking, running, jumping, and climbing.
"The person doesn't have to worry about the prosthetic device, they're worrying about the task in front of them," Carroll says. "If they want to go back to be with their troops, that's an option for many soldiers these days."
Fergason and his colleague, Ryan Blanck, say that each branch of the military has its own guidelines for allowing an amputated soldier to return to work, depending on his or her task. In many cases, it takes at least a year for a soldier to return to duty. The requirements for a fighter pilot, for instance, will be different than those for an infantryman or a behind-the-scenes supplies manager.
"It's the soldier's decision in the end," Blanck says. "Each case is unique to each person in some ways, just as each injury is unique—there's some fluidity behind it all."
But Fergason says that the soldiers who are going back into battle are able to perform just as well, if not better, than some of their fellow soldiers.
"If an individual is going back to full battle status, they need to perform at the same physical level as their colleagues," he says. "If they don't feel they can do exactly what they were doing before the injury, they can reclassify into a different position."
And for all the advances in technology, both Fergason and Blanck say it's the soldier's drive, not their prostheses, that allows them to return to work. In fact, many of the soldiers they work with use high-tech, battery-powered prostheses when they're behind the scenes, but in battle, they might want something more low-tech. The worst thing, Blanck says, would be for a soldier to be stranded in Kabul with a prosthetic leg that's run out of batteries.
"They have the opportunity to utilize technology that is very advanced, but when it comes down to it, they're most likely using something that's not subject to failure, something that's durable and reliable," he says. "They're using something a little more simplistic so they can strap and go. They don't want to have to worry about failure issues because of an electronic malfunction."
Those drawbacks, and the fact that prosthetics still have a ways to go before they're superior to natural limbs, mean America—or its enemies—won't be training an army of bionic super soldiers anytime soon.
Jonathan Moreno, a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania, talks about a future where prosthetics are "enhancers" that allow soldiers to be stronger, faster, and more durable than their peers. Carroll says there's a "very bright future" for powered prosthetics that allow soldiers to lift extremely heavy objects with little effort. He points to Oscar Pistorius, the South African, double-amputee sprinter who will likely participate at the Olympics this summer.
"There's a lot of controversy that his prosthetics might be so advanced that he has an advantage over a person's natural limbs," he says. But in a battlefield setting, there's still a long way to go, Fergason and Blanck say.
"I know the question is often, 'How close are we to true bionic or having artificial limbs that are more versatile than natural ones?'" Fergason says. "Frankly, we're not that close. You're not going to see anyone decide, 'Boy, I think I'd like to get a bionic leg because they're so fantastic.'
"We love to read about the super soldier, but that's not the case right now. Amputation is so complex in what it does to your body that it's a very long recovery," he adds. "I think the aspect of a super soldier is a long way off."
So for now, soldiers have to get by with existing prosthetics and try to perform as well as they did before the injury—which raises the question of whether it is fair to ask someone who has already given an arm or a leg for his or her country to keep fighting. Col. GI Wilson, a Marine Corps Iraq veteran, says that not only is it fair, it'd be unconscionable to keep these soldiers out of duty.
"Letting an amputee who can perform to standard serve makes more sense than asking them to be a victim and sent home," he says. "The amputees who want to serve want a paycheck, not a government disability check."

Donald Trump is poised to turn his hate-filled and bigoted campaign rhetoric about Muslims into policy. The man who despicably declared that “Islam hates us,” lied that “thousands” of Muslims cheered in New Jersey on 9/11 and claimed despite facts actually proving the opposite that American Muslims are hiding terrorists in our midst, per media reports will soon be banning people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States as well as barring Syrian and other refugees.
Given that during the campaign Trump released a statement—that to this day is still on his campaign's website—titled, “Donald J. Trump statement on preventing Muslim immigration,” it's fair to assume this is just step one on the path to a complete ban on Muslims.
To be honest, the idea of banning Muslims was nothing new. I had seen the same from numerous anti-Muslim bigots on social media in the past. What was stunning was that the front-runner for the GOP nomination would regurgitate it and a large percent of GOP primary voters would support it.
Perhaps I had naively believed (or hoped) that Trump would not try to turn this red meat for his bigoted base into policy. But I was wrong. And any Trump supporter who tells you this is not specifically a Muslim ban is either an apologist for Trump's hate or a liar. (There's no need to be PC to people who disdain political correctness.)
So what's the message of Trump's ban? Simple. Muslims are so inherently dangerous that we need to keep them out of this country. This is profiling on steroids. It's not that Trump is saying a specific Muslim person is a threat. Rather, he is saying millions are a danger because of bad acts of a few. It's truly no different than the police racially profiling African Americans.
And Trump's expected total ban on Syrian refugees is not based on evidence that Syrian refugees have committed acts of terror—because they have not. In fact Syrian refugees go through an extensive 18-24 month extreme vetting process —long before Trump ever suggested that concept.
So will Trump's “Muslim ban” prevent terrorism in America? No, in fact it will possibly cause even more violence if recent history is any indicator. And no I'm not talking ISIS-related, although counterterrorism experts have made it clear that demonization of Muslims by Trump will help ISIS recruit because their message “the West hates you” will resonate more strongly.
But I mean violence from some of Trump's anti-Muslim supporters who will be emboldened to lash out, or worse, at Muslim Americans. Trump makes these people believe their fear of all Muslims is valid. And look at what we have seen in the last few months even before this ban. In September, one self-professed Trump supporter burned down a mosque in Florida. In New Jersey the words “Donald Trump” were painted on Bayonne a mosque along with vile comments about Muslims. And the list of Trump supporters causing hate crimes continues.
Now if Trump truly wanted to keep us safe from terrorism he would also address domestic terrorism concerns, especially the right-wingers who want to kill Muslims. For example, Glendon Scott Crawford who was sentenced just last month to 30 years in prison for trying to use a weapon of mass destruction to slaughter Muslim Americans in New York state. Just a few moths ago, three Kansas men who called themselves “The Crusaders” (as in Christian crusaders) were arrested for plotting a terror attack to kill Somali Muslim immigrants because they wanted to “wake people up” to threat of Muslim immigrants. And then there is Robert Doggart, a Christian minister who is facing federal charges for plotting to kill Muslim Americans with an array of weapons from explosives to a machete. What is Trump doing to prevent more of these types of terrorists?
But Trump is not about solving America's problems—this is a man who trafficked in lies and hate for personal gain. In fact personal gain may actually explain why Trump has reportedly only wanted to ban Muslims from these seven Muslim countries: Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
Why wouldn't Trump want to ban Muslims from Turkey given there have been over 15 terror attacks there in the past year, many caused by ISIS? Could it be because Trump has business investments there with his twinned Trump Towers?
What about the United Arab Emirates, home of Dubai—which has seen its fair share of people joining ISIS and where contributions to the terrorist group Hamas are legal. Did Trump not ban Muslims from there because of his massive golf course and luxury home project in that country?
Then there's Indonesia, a place where the authorities killed three men on New Year's Eve plotting an ISIS inspired attack on civilians. Could it be he hasn't extended the ban there since Trump is currently developing a luxurious Trump resort in Indonesia? Maybe all Somalia and Sudan need to do to get off Trump's list is let him build a huge Trump hotel.
America under Trump is clearly changing. The promise that the United States is a welcoming place to those “yearning to breathe free” is being replaced by the vision of a man who ran a white supremacist, xenophobic themed campaign. And it appears that his reign as President will mirror that. Thankfully many groups—from Latinos to Muslims to Native Americans—are prepared to file lawsuits to thwart Trump's agenda, where possible. As long as the judiciary remains independent of Trump, we can rely on the court system to be fair.
The battle lines are clearly drawn in our nation. There are those who support Trump and those who stand on the side of American values of tolerance and pluralism that makes our nation exceptional. Which side are you on?
The New York Giants made their stance on the national anthem very clear Saturday afternoon against the New York Jets.
Tara Sullivan of The Record tweeted out a photo of the players before the game perfectly lined up during the national anthem.

The national anthem before football games became a major issue after after San Fransisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for it because he believes minorities are oppressed. (RELATED: Millionaire NFL Quarterback Has Mind-Boggling Reason For Refusal To Stand For National Anthem)
New York Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz also had some words of advice for Kaepernick.
“I think, personally, the flag is the flag. Regardless of how you feel about the things that are going on in America today and the things that are going on across the world with gun violence and things like that. You've got to respect the flag and stand up with your teammates. It's bigger than just you, in my opinion. I think you go up there. You're with your team, and you pledge your allegiance to the flag and the national anthem as a team, and then you go about your business, whatever your beliefs are,” Cruz stated in part.
Kaepernick might not like the national anthem, but there's clearly no doubt that the Giants players and staff support it.

Whip the heavy cream until it is thick and frothy (you don't need an electric whisk, handheld will do fine. Just beat vigorously for about 5 minutes). Set aside.
Whisk together the eggs, egg yolk, honey and vanilla extract in a large bowl til it is a slick, yellow liquid.
Fold the egg yolks into the whipped cream. Add the pecans.
Pour the liquid into four individual ramekins (or one big bowl if it's all for you, which is totally acceptable – I don't know what kind of day you've had). Put in the freezer overnight. I'm talking a good 12 hour stretch because this bad boy takes a while to freeze. Gravity being what it is, those pecans are going to want to settle at the bottom so, a few hours into the freezing, you might want to remove it from the freezer and stir it up before returning and letting it solidify further.
To serve cut into chunks and drizzle with cocoa powder, more honey or toasted pecans. Go crazy and make a whole damn sundae!

Hey all, hope you're well. Updates from various departments in zombie land this fair Mondoid.
BUILD 37 IWBUMS BETA
We released a bugfix update last week to Build 37's Muld/Rosewood etc lootable maps, and also their marking and annotation system. There's another ‘fix build' on the brew, and any and all feedback is welcome. Specifically, the new ‘oven dial' UI has been built for multiple uses across the game's many devices – so feedback on its general usability would be greatly appreciated.
Next up, although we'll give full details once it's in the can, RJ is going to work on expanding this system so that it benefits MP safehouses with annotated maps that can be put on public display, and a plan we have about pre-annotated maps discovered on zed bodies that'll be useful/fun in SP and co-op.
Details on how to access the IWBUMS beta – here. [We've removed password from the beta, as everyone's quite used to unstable branches these days.]
ANIMS
One element that's been a part of the perils of getting the animation build playable and into testing, is that the closer you get – the more issues in general gameplay become clear, and the more evident it is that they need fixing. The ‘not fun' factor looms large. Primarily, in this instance, was cludgy indoor movement with a side salad of ‘rotate on-the-spot' zeds and survivors looking pretty crap.
As such, while pulling everything together, there's been a side-thread of work going on with Martin the Animator to see how we can improve things. It's all to do with ‘root motion' – in the new PZ anims the movement of characters has always been directly taken from the animation data itself, instead of being pumped into the character in the game logic.
Thing is, there was one important part of the system that it became increasingly clear that we needed: we only had support for movement in a straight line, and no support for characters to rotate within animations and for this rotation to translate into the rotation of characters in-game.
Up until now we still had to rotate characters/zeds in the game code and completely divorced from the animation. The most obvious consequence of this was that despite characters making realistic steps when walking, sneaking and so on (and in videos as you've seen, if the character is rotated while sneaking it works pretty well) rotating on the spot would still produce ‘slidey on the spot rotating'. This works okay in the current game, but looks a bit silly when the animations around it are much more realistic.
Without going into lots of technical details this was a much more complicated and confusing problem to solve than the positional root motion system [Mondoid writer aside, direct to camera: seriously there's been all this chat about Quarteronions that's pretty much incomprehensible to me], but after a meet-up with Martin last week we finally worked out the best way of how to approach it.
Now (well, almost now, there's still one more bug to sort out that would have resulted in an in-game video today) we have support for rotations, it allows us to improve in various areas, as well as fix the issues mentioned above.
In Summary:
a) Rotating on the spot. When the player rotates on the spot, we'll be able to have them actually make steps to turn themselves without the aforementioned sliding in a circle with feet stationary.
b) A big issue with movement that we found it difficult to solve was that with deferred movement it's important that the character's movement mirrors the animation, and that characters don't rotate super-fast to change direction. In-game this lead to a kind of inertia effect, with characters speeding up from stationary and having a finite turning speed, meant that indoor navigation got a lot more difficult.
Now, however, we'll be able to have the character turn and step in any direction as part of their ‘starting to walk/run' animation. Zeds and survivors, for example, can twist their torso while immediately stepping to the right, left, or making a turn through 180 degrees.
This should make movement a lot more responsive and immediate, and though this is clearly nothing to do with our game specifically this should give you an idea of the kind of rotational character locomotion we're talking about.
c) There are a fair few animations, particularly in the ‘wall hugging' advanced cover traversal system, that require this rotational movement to be able to function. This is a system that isn't currently planned to be implemented in the anims test build release, but was a major technical barrier to it – and it feels good to have a system in-place that bypasses it.
d) In future a lot of stuff like zombie walks could now have rotational movement encoded into the animations, to make their movement much more realistic and non-linear. The same could apply to an injured character's movement, drunken stumbles and other things. It opens up a lot of doors.
ITEMZED RELEASE
Turbo has just released the full version of ItemZed. This is a development and modding tool that's used to edit the contents of script modules (foodstuff items, weapons, recipes etc) and the distribution table that dictates where different in-game items can be found and looted on the map.
On top of the tool's previous test release, there's now options for the batch refactoring of large numbers of items and in-game objects and lua integration that allows the entire data set to be programmatically modified, and output to any sort of format – meaning that changes and new items can quickly and easily become part of user mods, and a part of the main game.
Here's a vid Turbo's made to explain it all a bit, turn on English subtitles for written descriptions.
OTHER STUFF
General Arcade continue their work on getting map-streaming, physics and MP sync ready for EP's vehicles. New recruit Eugene is also getting used to the codebase by mixing in Discord compatibility with game chat as an extension of our old IRC plugin, given our increasing love for the service.
The inestimable RingoD has updated his comprehensive guide to creating user maps in WorldZed and TileZed, with an updated Section 3 detailing exactly how to make individual buildings. The Steam version can found here. We're delighted to see that there's a bunch of people already using these, and creating cool stuff.
