Three glaciers holding back a vast ice stream in northeast Greenland, a region thought to be the last bastion of stability in that rapidly warming region, are now thinning and moving more rapidly into the sea, a new study found.
The study overturns longstanding assumptions that the northeastern corner of Greenland, which is one of the coldest and driest parts of the world's largest island, is stable, and instead suggests that sea level rise projections based on this assumption will need to be reevaluated.
The study, by an international group of researchers from Denmark, the Netherlands, the U.S. and China, found that regional warming has likely caused three outlet glaciers bordering Fram Strait and the Nordic Sea in far northeast Greenland, to lose mass in recent years, matching similar observed trends in the southwest, west and northwest of Greenland. One of the outlet glaciers, in fact, has receded 12.4 miles in just the past 10 years.
Study coauthor Shfaqat A. Khan of the Technical University of Denmark told Mashable he was surprised to find such significant ice loss in northeast Greenland, considering how cold and dry that region is. Previous studies of sea level rise had not included the prospect of melting there, he said.

“Nature is changing faster than expected and seems to respond much stronger than expected to small fluctuations,” he said. “This also means that predictions of future sea level rise need to be revised.”
More worrisome, Khan and his coauthors said, is that these glaciers help hold back a nearly 370-mile long ice stream that extends deep into Greenland's interior. This ice stream accounts for about 16% of the total ice sheet, and if it destabilizes, it could have severe consequences for low-lying coastal cities worldwide.
Greenland is the world's largest island, extending more than 1,200 miles from its southern to northernmost points, and if all of its ice were to melt — which would likely take many centuries, if not thousands of years — the oceans would rise by more than 20 feet. Already, the melting of the Greenland ice sheet is one of the largest contributors to global sea level rise, accounting for about .02 inches of the .13 inches per year global average sea level rise (local rates of sea level rise vary significantly).
Scientists trying to predict how much sea level rise the world will see in the next several decades have had to grapple with uncertainties about the stability of Greenland as well as portions of Antarctica, and this new study adds to the evidence showing that sea level rise may be more likely to be on the higher end of the scale rather than the lower end.
The most recent report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that global average sea level is likely to increase by 10.2 to 32 inches by the year 2100, with the highest emissions scenario showing a sea level rise of between 21 and 38 inches by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise unabated.

The new study, published Sunday in the journal Nature Climate Change, found that the northeast Greenland ice stream has been “relatively stable" since at least the mid-to-late 1970s, with a period of rapid dynamic thinning beginning sometime between 2003 and 2006, and continuing through 2013. The researchers traced this to a change in the movement of the ice stream's three main outlet glaciers: one known as "79 North," as well as the Zachariae Isstrom Glacier, and the Storstrommen Glacier.
These glaciers had been restrained by pack ice that stayed close to shore year-round, but regional warming in recent years has reduced this ice cover.
This has had the effect of removing the parking brake on these glaciers, allowing them to start sliding faster toward the sea. In addition, the intrusion of relatively warm ocean waters may have also played a role, since when they come in contact with the bases of outlet glaciers, they can erode the ice from below, causing increased melting.
Jonathan Bamber, a professor at the University of Bristol who is a coauthor of the study, told Mashable that the researchers aren't entirely sure what caused the outlet glaciers in northeast Greenland to speed up their melt rate, but they suspect that a warm period between 2003 and 2006 played a role. However, even with a return to lower temperatures since, the ice has continued melting at an increased rate of more than 10 gigatons per year, which suggests this trend is likely to continue, he said. (One gigaton is equal to 1 billion tons.)

One concern scientists have is that if the outlet glaciers along the coastline, which make contact with the ocean waters, lose more ice, they may allow the far larger mass of land-based ice behind them to make a push toward the sea.
“This is the first time anyone has ever observed a sudden acceleration of ice loss in the downhill (outlet) portions of a really long ice stream. So, we are in terra incognita,” said study coauthor Michael Bevis of Ohio State University, in an interview with Mashable.
Khan told Mashable that the northeast Greenland ice stream may be destined for the same fate as the more famous Jakobshavn glacier in southwest Greenland, which has been thinning and retreating for more than a decade, at an increasing rate of about 30 gigatons per year.
Additionally, Khan said northeast Greenland has a similar downward-sloping topography to Jakobshavn where the ice meets the bedrock and sea floor, and, since the ice stream extends so far inland, the northeast ice stream constitutes a bigger risk than Jakobshavn does for contributing to sea level rise.
“Ice loss will continue and likely increase like Jakobshavn. Furthermore, the northeast drainage area is twice that of Jakobshavn. Thus, here we have a giant which could be Greenland's largest contributor to sea level rise in [a] few years,” Khan said in an email conversation.
To gain insight into the ice mass trends of northeastern Greenland, the researchers combined multiple readings of elevation data from aircraft overflights, several satellite sensors and even digital photographs of the area taken beginning in 1976. They also used GPS devices mounted on the bedrock of Greenland to measure any changes in the weight of the ice sheet. This data all showed a clear acceleration in ice loss in the northeast Greenland ice stream.
According to the study, the loss rate of the northeast Greenland ice stream is more than 10 gigatons per year as measured between April 2006 and April 2012. This is similar to the loss rate seen at the Jakobshavn Isbrae glacier.
However, melting of the northeast Greenland ice stream is a more recent development compared to the mass loss of the Jakobshavn Isbrae glacier, Bevin says, and there is a chance that the northeast Greenland ice stream will temporarily slow down or pause its melting altogether for a time due to natural climate variability.
“The pace of change is not even,” he said. “It's certainly possible it will go down for a while, but chances are [that] it will go up again.”
Even with natural variability, though, Bevin says the long-term trend is clear. “We have no reason to believe that either the air warming or the ocean warming is going to stop, so it would be kind of irrational to assume that the rate of melt in Greenland is going to stop too,” he said.
The Greenland ice sheet as a whole has been melting at an increasing rate during the past decade as warming has increased. Bevis, who worked on the GPS data network that helped confirm the northeast Greenland ice loss trends, says Greenland's mass loss nearly tripled since 2002.
“The instability of Greenland is growing," says Bevis.
As Greenland has warmed by an average of about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit since the 1980s, the average ice-sheet-wide mass loss increased from about 172.4 gigatons per year from April 2003 through 2006, to 359.8 gigatons per year from April 2009 through 2012, the study found. This increase in melting has raised concerns regarding the potential acceleration in global sea level rise.
The Greenland ice sheet marked a melting milestone in 2012 when surface melting was observed across 97 percent of the ice sheet, including normally frigid high elevation areas in central Greenland.

The Intel Compute Stick is a tiny computer with an HDMI connector on one end. Plug the device into the HDMI port on your TV or monitor, and you've basically got an all-in-one desktop that can run Windows or Linux.
Intel introduced the Compute Stick at CES in January, and it's expected to hit the streets later this month. Now a couple of retailers are taking pre-orders.
Update: Check our our Intel Compute Stick review for more details!
Newegg is selling the Compute Stick with Windows 8.1 software, 2GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage for $150. Adorama is selling the same model for $140.
A Linux model with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage costs $110.
Intel isn't the first company to produce a PC-on-a-stick. Models with ARM processors and Android software have been available for a few years, and in the past few months we've seen Chinese device makers introduce a handful of other models with Intel Atom processors and Windows 8.1 software.
But the Compute Stick comes with Intel name and official support from the chipmaker, which could help make it a more attractive option for some customers, even though it costs a little more than some other mini PCs.
Update: It looks like the Linux version of the Compute Stick may ship with Ubuntu 14.04, and you can find the latest BIOS and driver downloads for the Windows and Linux models at Intel's website.
thanks riddick and Linuxium!
Is Mike Hearn really a Bitcoin Core dev?
Bitso Blocked Unblock Follow Jan 19, 2016
Today in the morning I got a bit curious about exactly what had Mike Hearn contributed to the Bitcoin project. So I downloaded the project history to take a look.
Up to this moment (January 19th, 2016 @ 2:04PM Mexico City Time), Bitcoin's GitHub project had registered 9,945 commits. Of those, 1,100 were by Gavin Andresen (who is leading the Bitcoin Classic initiative). And only 11 commits had Mike Hearn as an Author, who the media has acclaimed as one of the masterminds behind Bitcoin.
Bitcoin's top 5 contributors are:
Wladimir J. van der Laan (3,297 commits)
Gavin Andresen (1,100 commits)

“Potala Palace”
By Tashi
Red prince of my heart
That quenches my thirst for the history of a thousand years, In your presence sprouts the life force of knowledge
In the garden of my consciousness.
The eternal flame of the butter lamp that flickers in my eyes Is stoked by my sweat and blood.
The land of snows has entrusted everything to you, And you too
Fearlessly speak the word of truth
For the sake of our hopes and prayers.
Potala Palace!
The consciousness of my forefathers rests On your high throne.
I forever
Will decorate your pillars with golden rings.
But the fierce wind from the East
Has many times racked with tongues of flame Your tender form.
O great yogi, in whose heart swirls unadulterated compassion, You forever
Like the blood moving in my body
Will rise to face the challenge of history.
Embodying the integrity of a nation,
Even though you are hurt you lick your wounds And stand proud in all circumstances.
While the sharp fangs of a dark beast
A tailless dog pretending to be a lion
Utters empty threats from its cave.
Potala Palace!
The solitary hero, never changing. I forever
Will serve under your blessing.
Potala Palace!
From the first time I welcomed the sun and the moon Until when the circulation of my blood stops,
My loyalty to you in body, speech, and mind
Shall remain eternal.

The 2013 Bowie exhibition is among a number of successes for Martin Roth at the V&A CHRISTIAN MARQUARDT
The director of the Victoria and Albert Museum is expected to quit this week to return to his native Germany, after be­coming disillusioned by the prospect of an increasingly insular Britain post-Brexit.
Martin Roth, 61, who is seen as the London museum's most successful director since Roy Strong in the 1970s, will tell staff tomorrow morning and announce it publicly when he unveils the V&A's latest exhibition, Revolution, exploring the culture of the late 1960s and early 1970s.
Before the referendum he spoke of his concerns that a Brexit vote “could ruin everything our parents' generation achieved — a policy of peace, reconciliation and common thought”.
Roth, who worked in France, the US and Germany before London, said that “in the long term, Brexit would…
Minneapolis embraced a new wave of tech-driven transportation companies Tuesday by giving initial approval to legalizing Lyft and UberX services, while simultaneously loosening regulations on the city's taxi industry.
The unanimous City Council committee vote follows months of haggling between the smartphone-based companies, the taxi industry and city regulators. The full council must still weigh in on the proposal next week.
Lyft and UberX essentially allow people to act as chauffeurs of their own vehicles, and customers contract with them through their GPS-enabled smartphones. Their arrival several months ago ignited a debate at City Hall over how to regulate these unlicensed businesses, which often compete with heavily regulated taxicabs.
Despite a push for one ordinance to cover both industries, the final language sets out clear differences. Only taxis can pick up passengers who hail them on the street, for example, but services such as Lyft aren't bound to charge rates set by the city.
“I'm here to thank you for … welcoming Lyft into the Minneapolis market,” Candace Taylor, manager of government relations at Lyft, told the committee. “We intend to expand our service … [and] are committed to making sure there is accessibility for everyone in this jurisdiction.”
Critics said that Uber, the owner of UberX, and Lyft, now known as “transportation network companies,” will raise prices without government oversight and discriminate against certain passengers.
“People who don't live in very nice neighborhoods, they don't have to pick up or drive home,” testified Martha Hague at Tuesday's hearing.
The proposal's sponsor, Council Member Jacob Frey, countered that the city will audit where the companies have been accepting and denying rides. Plus, he noted, taxis are already discriminating, referencing a recent Star Tribune article documenting an incident in which cabdrivers refused rides to two black women. “Will there be problems with Lyft and Uber? There may very well be. We live in a society that is at times discriminatory. Now as government, it's our job to guard against that,” Frey said.
While transportation network companies can sometimes be cheaper than cabs, the UberX service charges three times its normal rate during peak hours — with a $20 minimum. On Tuesday afternoon, Lyft was charging $1.71 per mile and $0.22 a minute, plus nearly $1.68 in fees. Taxis can charge $2.75 a mile under the meter rate, after a first mile of $4.70 and a $2.50 initial fee.
“As a cabdriver, I cannot raise my rates,” said driver Fred Anderson. “And I'm obligated to take all customers unlike [transportation network companies].This is not a level playing field.”
But the taxi industry scored major victories with an effort led by Council Member Abdi Warsame to change some ordinances in place since the 1980s.
Vehicles can be inspected at non-city facilities, for example, and cabs can be in use five years longer than they can now. A requirement to have a certain number of wheelchair-accessible cabs was replaced with an incentive program for both taxis and the transportation network companies.
Drivers would also be able to use cabs as private vehicles, with more parking privileges, and owners could charge drivers more than $85 a shift.
The city will impose a license fee of $35,000 a year on transportation network companies, and another $10,000 as a surcharge if they do not have wheelchair-accessible vehicles. The license fee will help pay for a new inspector, while the wheelchair charge will help fund a to-be-determined fleet of accessible vehicles.
Insurance proved to be one of the trickiest parts of regulating transportation network companies. UberX, for example, uses a hybrid commercial policy that “supplements a driver's personal auto insurance.” The state's insurance commissioner said that this raised the possibility of “unacceptable” insurance gaps, recommending that UberX obtain traditional commercial insurance.
The current proposal requires drivers to have their personal insurance policies acknowledge their roles as occasional commercial drivers. Transportation network companies then must cover drivers when they are logged into the system.
“This is an innovative business model,” Frey said of the taxi alternatives. “This is thinking outside of the box. This is what progress looks like. And any time you have progress, there will be pushback.”
Warsame said the proposal is intended to take some burden off taxicabs, which despite heavy regulation in Minneapolis, have grown in numbers from 373 in 2007 to 854 today because the city lifted a cap on the number of licenses.
“I believe that taxicab drivers are ambassadors to the city of Minneapolis,” War­same said. “But they have not been treated that way in a long time. I also believe that they are an integral part of our public transportation network.”

File photo of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley
With many Indians worrying about the threat of tough measures in their new government's first budget next week, a Facebook post suggesting the Finance Minister might be pondering less earthly matters quickly roused anger on Wednesday.
Arun Jaitley, a key confidante of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, published a message celebrating "World UFO Day" on his Facebook page, which is one of the main forums in which he publishes official information.
"This day is celebrated to raise awareness about the existence of UFO's (sic) and with that intelligent beings from outer space," said the post, which was followed by Mr Jaitley's name and included a depiction of a flying saucer in a wheat field.
World UFO Day is a day dedicated to spotting and proving the existence of unidentified flying objects. It was first celebrated in 2001, according to the website worldofuday.com.
A member of Mr Jaitley's personal staff, who declined to be named, confirmed that their team had posted the message about World UFO Day and said the account had not been hacked. The post was deleted half an hour after Reuters contacted the team.
The post sparked a storm of criticism among his followers and was deleted after a few hours.
"Sir FM, today we the people of India are celebrating the price hike day instead of UFO day," a Facebook user said in a comment on Mr Jaitley's post, referring to India's recent moves to raise rail fares and fuel prices.
Mr Modi swept to power in May with a vow to revive India's economy after the longest spell of growth below 5 per cent in a quarter of a century, and he has since warned that the turnaround will involve some "bitter medicine".
On July 10, Mr Jaitley is expected to unveil a budget that will try to rein in a wide fiscal deficit partly by curbing the government's high subsidy bill in a country where 70 per cent of people live on less than $2 a day. He said on Tuesday that "bold steps" were needed to ensure fiscal discipline."Sir instead of talking on outer space, please confine your discussion on the hardship faced by common men," another user said in a comment."People are confused and scared about the undefined miseries which are going to be heaped upon them in the names of restoring fiscal health of the country."Officials in the Finance Ministry said they had seen the Facebook post and advised the minister's personal media team to be more careful about what is published on his Facebook account.Investors have been impressed by Mr Jaitley's hawkish tone. The benchmark BSE index rose as much as 1.1 per cent to an all-time high of 25,810 on Wednesday, surpassing its previous record of 25,735.87 hit on June 11. Copyright @ Thomson Reuters 2014
Living in Costa Rica gives you the freedom to spend almost as little or much as you choose; while many things are inexpensive, North American-style luxuries can add up. Despite this fact, life in Costa Rica is generally less expensive than an equivalent lifestyle in the United States, Canada or Europe, as many expatriates will happily attest.
Monthly Budget
Those expats interested in simple living should budget $1500 or less monthly. Generally, this budget allows for bus rides and the occasional taxi, big trips to the farmers' market and a few restaurant meals each month. Others choose to retire or live in relative luxury, employing full-time housekeepers, commuting by car, enjoying exquisite homes and consuming imported goods. In the Central Valley, such lifestyles can easily amount to $3000 or more monthly.
Housing
Rents in rural areas and select urban areas hover around $300-$600 for a well-furnished apartment or small home. At this price, renters can expect Costa Rican-style amenities, which may include line-drying laundry and bathrooms equipped with electric shower heads. A lavish three-bedroom home near San Jose complete with granite countertops, Jacuzzi bathtubs and hot water heater starts at approximately $1500 monthly, and can cost much more.
Food & Dining
Food costs in Costa Rica largely depend on personal preferences. At a moderately-priced sit-down restaurant, a salad, main course and glass of wine will cost $15-20 per person. At sodas, the Costa Rican version of the neighborhood mom-and-pop, a full meal plus natural fruit drink will only run you $2-4. For those who enjoy cooking at home, groceries run the price gamut, and depend heavily on whether you consume imported or local goods. For example, an exhaustive trip to your local farmers' market will cost $20-40, and can provide a small family with the fruits, vegetables, meats and fish necessary for a week's worth of meals. On the other hand, purchasing expensive meats, imported wines and other premium goods at Auto Mercado, a grocery chain that specializes in high-end foodstuffs, could cost more than $200 per week for a small family.
Goods & Services
Remember that as a general rule, services and labor are inexpensive, but many goods are more expensive than back home. In other words, A housekeeper may charge $2 per hour, but a new car can cost almost twice as much as in the United States. (Used cars can be bought for only slightly more than their North American equivalents.) Gas and diesel are expensive here, usually costing $1-$2 more per gallon than in the U.S.
Entertainment
The extra money spent on transportation is easily recouped in entertainment costs – trips to museums, outdoor concerts and street fairs generally run less than $5 per person. Most concerts and traveling shows cost the same as in other countries. For outdoor entertainment, Costa Rica's extensive park system, wildlife adventures and gardens will satisfy any nature enthusiast. Be aware that tourists (anyone not legally classified as a resident or citizen) pay entrance fees (usually $10-$20), though proceeds help support the country's national parks and private reserves.
Health Care
Medical care in Costa Rica is of high quality and very inexpensive. Currently, residents have three options: private insurance, subscription to the CCSS (Costa Rican Social Security) or a combination of the two. Through INS (the National Insurance Institute), private medical insurance costs about $60-$130/month per person. Through the Caja's public service, insurance for a family (two adults and their under-18 dependents) will cost $30-$50/month. Note that all legal residents are required to pay membership in the Caja. For those under age 55, Caja payments include a mandatory pension payment, which will be paid out beginning at age 65.

Scottish National Party politicians have clashed on inclusive sex education, after a gay MEP called for inclusive education to be mandatory in all schools.
Alyn Smith, currently a Member of the European Parliament for Scotland, is one of four candidates bidding to become the party's Depute Leader.
In an op-ed for Scottish newspaper The National this week, he expressed his support for the Time for Inclusive Education campaign.
He wrote: “Schools are a key part of the experience young people have, and I entirely agree that we do need to bring LGBTI issues into the classroom.
“I would have thought that the establishment of teacher training to enable teachers to provide education which is inclusive of the broad spectrum of sexual orientations and identities is surely not a controversial point. But it is.
“There are, sadly, still people subjected to the ideology that says certain sexual orientations or gender identities are inherent moral defects.
“This just needs to stop, and while freedom of religion is important, if any organisation is providing a publicly funded service then that freedom is surpassed by a duty to equality and the law.
“We have curriculum for excellence, we're more than capable of setting what our schools need to do, we need to set the bar a bit higher on LGBTI issues. In all schools, no exceptions.”
Speaking to the Scottish Catholic Observer, Mr Smith said that Catholic schools should not be afforded an “exception” from the law.
But speaking to the same outlet, Depute leadership rival Chris McEleny attacked the comments, insisting “it should be up to [parents] what they want for the future of their children's education”.
Mr McEleny said: “Catholic schools are protected by an act of Parliament. As far as I see it that for as long as the Catholic community and Catholic families want to keep Catholic schools I will wholeheartedly support them.
“Catholic schools came to be in Scotland due to historic discrimination and sectarianism our community faced. Without which Catholics wouldn't have had an education.
“Therefore there is a clear and unique legacy of how they came to be. Over the years we have made great strides in fighting sectarianism however Catholic schools have evolved into a whole lot more than just a school that allows Catholics to be educated.
“My Catholic education I received made me the person I am today. In an age that practicing your faith is increasingly difficult, I'm not ashamed of my faith; it defines me.
“My faith, my family and my community are the driving forces in why I'm involved in politics, to improve the world as I see it for the better.
“We must always reject and educate the argument that Catholic schools cause sectarianism in Scotland; study after study has proven this to be completely false.”
Before he died last year, Uzbekistan president Islam Karimov was a killer. Accused critics and dissidents were tortured and died in prisons under his quarter-century rule. On a state visit to neighboring Turkmenistan during the 1990s, Karimov walked up to me, his finger wagging. “We hope that one day you will understand our country,” he said, pointing in my face. Somehow, it sounds a lot less menacing in writing. I lasted two years as a Tashkent-based correspondent for Newsweek before being expelled.
The Russians gave me the bad news at Vnukovo Airport in Moscow, on arrival from Georgia, less than a year later. I was expelled from there, too—persona non grata (the Russians use the more insulting term, “undesirable face.”) Boris Yeltsin was president at the time, but I never learned who the miffed party behind my departure was in this case.
There are a ton of such stories in the authoritarian and autocratic countries of the world—of presidents and systems who regard independent voices as something to rant about, demonize, banish, and, often, snuff out. My Wall Street Journal reporting partner in Pakistan, Daniel Pearl, was killed when he ended up in the wrong hands while doing his job. He is among 1,230 journalists to be killed over the last quarter century around the world, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
So while it's surprising to see a form of this style of leadership in the United States, and to see it cheered by supporters and defended by aides, it's not unfamiliar. I am speaking of US president Donald Trump's denunciation on Friday of five news organizations as “the enemy of the American people!”
Reporters around the world know this drill—a leader who feels a need for an enemy in order to rule effectively. And so he creates one. As for the wild praise of his followers, I and colleagues have seen that, too—the president who plays to the galleries. Trump does not hate the media—for him, it is theater. His followers are forever baffled that reporters take the bait, and don't get that you have to understand the spirit of Trump, and ignore his precise words.
The reason that reporters are not quick to ha-ha it up with Trump's followers is that the US presidency is not a show, and his words not entertainment. Trump seems to think that the truth is just another expendable commodity. Few other democratically elected leaders agree. Saying what you mean and meaning what you say matter, as Wall Street Journal columnist Bret Stephens said so well in delivering the annual Daniel Pearl memorial lecture in California this week.
Many people in Russia and Uzbekistan, too, have felt energized and legitimized when their leader vilifies the “other.” But it is not a joke to use the power of the ultimate bully pulpit to attack every alternate democratic voice—the so-called judges, the Fed, NATO, “lightweight” Democratic opponents, and so on.
Trump forces us therefore to up our game. And, having seen it before, we don't fear it. Global history shows that, while some institutions will crumble, important pillars will remain—in the case of the US, Congress may be going along with the president, but there still are the courts, independent political figures, and the media.
Trump—you keep doing your job as you see fit. And we will keep doing ours.
Apple in a recent filing with Australia's antitrust watchdog slammed a request from the country's three top banks for collective negotiations over third-party access to Apple Pay NFC technology, saying a threatened boycott would not only harm consumers, but hinder mobile wallet adoption and innovation.
Apple's submission to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission comes as the body decides whether to allow banks in the region power to negotiate terms for access to iPhone's mobile wallet hardware. The response was made public on Monday and follows an initial letter to the ACCC filed earlier this month Australia's "big-three" banks, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank and Westpac Banking Corp, along with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, initially lodged their application to negotiate in July. Among the numerous contingencies afforded as part of the request are terms for offering third-party mobile wallet services on Apple devices, the ability to charge consumers fees for using Apple Pay and a narrow set of security guidelines drafted by the banks."Apple expects that, if the boycott and collective negotiation conduct were permitted to occur, the banks involved will advance in lockstep with the slowest, the least willing member of their cartel," Apple said. "This delay is likely to harm consumers and slow the pace of innovation for mobile wallets in Australia."The banks are looking to stall consumer adoption of Apple Pay and other mobile wallet solutions with onerous authorization stipulations, a process that stifles competition, Apple says. Further, the banks are asking the ACCC for three years to negotiate amicable terms, a period Apple suggests was designed to create yet another artificial barrier to adoption.Attached to —and cited frequently —in the lengthy response is a report from Dr. Christopher Pleatsikas, an economist based in San Diego, Calif., who provides an almost point-by-point rebuttal of the banks' request.For its part, the banks say Australians have been moving to contactless payments systems long before Apple broke onto the scene, a spokesman for the banks told AppleInsider in an emailed statement. The banks claim they, along with Australia's merchants and payments processors, have played an integral role in the rollout of touchless solutions."Apple's submission to the ACCC makes it clear that Apple does not want to give iPhone users the ability to choose an integrated third party wallet of their own preference," the spokesman said. "Unlike users of Samsung and Android, Apple is blocking access to the NFC function and wants to leave iPhone users with no choice but to use Apple Pay. Their submission to the ACCC claims this lack of choice is in the best interest of Australian consumers. The applicants disagree. Instead, they want to negotiate with Apple so there is an opportunity to offer other integrated wallets alongside Apple Pay."Retailers and payments associations have, in fact, filed in support of joint negotiations, citing market stimulation, security and payments fees transparency, among other consumer issues.The ACCC is expected to arrive at a decision by October. In the meantime, the watchdog denied banks interim authorization to negotiate with Apple citing complexities of the issue at hand.
In an interview with Jim Rome, DeRozan talked about a multitude of things including his All-Star selection, being labelled as a dunker, finally winning in Toronto, and even Drake. Something that stuck out was him giving a shout out to the fans and talking about how the name in front of the jersey is serious business for him and the team:
The city embraced me, made me feel at home. The only difference [between Compton and Toronto] for me is the cold.
I worked so hard this summer just to bring back the city of Toronto the joyfulness that they always want. We have one of the best fans in the NBA, they come out and support us every night. Everybody on this team fights, not just for us, but for this city because they support us so much. We lay everything on the line every time we step out there on that court.
It seems like every time you open the morning paper, more powerful men are being accused of groping, raping and generally treating their female colleagues in inappropriate and degrading ways.
But it's not just the political, corporate and entertainment titans of today who are being called out; many sins of the past are being re-examined in the context of our new sensitivities regarding gender relations.
You don't have to look any farther than the pages of the New York Times or the airwaves of MSNBC to hear liberal voices openly opining that they blew it in the 1990s by not calling on former President Bill Clinton to step down after he admitted to an ongoing sexual relationship with a much younger intern.
Not to mention the rape allegations brought up by Juanita Broderick.

The selective court of mob justice Some on the left are even suggesting that we reexamine the way we look at former President John F. Kennedy, in light of new information regarding how he treated female employees in the White House.
However, one prominent name has managed to stay off of our radar, and I don't know why. I am, of course, speaking of former Vice President Al Gore.
Back in October of 2006, a Portland, Ore. masseuse accused the former vice president of “unwanted sexual contact” while performing a massage on him in a hotel room.
While speaking to detectives in January of 2009 the woman said she had been doing requested abdominal work on Mr. Gore when he demanded she go lower.
The New York Times reported that she told police, “I was shocked and I did not massage beyond what is considered a safe, nonsexual area of the abdomen,” she said. “He further insisted and acted angry, becoming verbally sharp and loud.”
“I went into much deeper shock as I realized it appeared he was demanding sexual favors or sexual behaviors.”
She alleged he later tried to have sex with her.
“I did not immediately call the police as I feared being made into a public spectacle and my reputation being destroyed,” she said. “I was not sure what to tell them and was concerned my story would not be believed since there was no DNA evidence from a completed act of rape.”
No charges were ever filed due to a “lack of evidence.”
A second incident allegedly took place at a luxury Beverly Hills hotel in 2007 when Gore was in town for the Oscars.
According to the National Enquirer, a Beverly Hills hotel source told them, “The therapist claimed that when they were alone, Gore shrugged off a towel and stood naked in front of her.
The Enquirer also alleges Gore's fruit came out of the loom a third time, a year later at a hotel in Tokyo.
I'm sure his defenders will attack the journalistic integrity of the Enquirer, but I would note that they were the ones who broke the John Edwards, Bill Cosby and Charlie Sheen stories before the mainstream media would touch them with a 10 foot pole.
It's also worth noting that Radar magazine, a subsidiary of the National Enquirer, featured Charlie Rose in a cover story about “Toxic Bachelors” in 2007, and refused to run a retraction when David Boies — Al Gore's attorney in the 2000 Florida recount — threatened to sue them. Others on the list: Jeremy Piven, Jeffrey Epstein, Colin Farrell, Joe Francis and Kevin Spacey.
Like the vast majority of the #MeToo accusers I've seen on television of late, I believe the women who say that Al Gore assaulted them.
Any conversation about powerful men behaving badly should include Al Gore's name. Even if it is “an inconvenient truth.”

One of Donald Trump's former top aides says he plans to use money donated to the Committee to Restore America's Greatness super PAC to "finance a hard-hitting television and radio campaign" that will accuse Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) of striking a "secret deal" with one of his rivals to weaken Trump's candidacy for the White House.
Roger Stone, a conservative operative who left Trump's campaign in August, appears to have posted a letter on the super PAC's website on Thursday that accuses Rubio of forging a "secret alliance" with Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) to destroy Trump. Stone alleges that Rubio's "well-heeled backers will funnel millions to Kasich," who will then mount a "massive multi-million dollar paid television attack on Donald Trump in the early primary states." In exchange for attacking Trump, Stone claims that Rubio has promised to make Kasich his vice president.
"We are calling on average Americans and everyday citizens to help us finance a hard-hitting television and radio campaign exposing the real Marco Rubio, and his secret deal with would-be vice-president John Kasich," Stone writes in the letter, encouraging Trump's supporters to contribute "$20, $30, $50, $100, or more" through the super PAC's website, snail mail or over the phone by calling a California phone number and leaving a voice message.
When asked to respond to the accusation, a spokesman for Kasich said in a statement that this PAC "only seeks to enrich someone Trump fired."
"He hopes that saying outrageous things gets attention to raise some money," said Rob Nichols, the spokesman. "It's pathetic but completely characteristic of who's doing it."
Stone, who says he left the campaign on his own and was not fired, has yet to respond to requests for comment. Rubio's campaign has yet to respond to Stone's accusations.
Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, called the super PAC a "big-league scam deal" and accused Stone of trying to profit off Trump's candidacy. Lewandowski said he has not talked to Stone since he fired him this summer and does not understand why Stone continues to promote the super PAC after repeated requests to stop.
The super PAC was first registered as Americans for Trump PAC on Oct. 17 and changed its name to Committee to Restore America's Greatness three days later. Stone is not identified in the super PAC's Federal Election Commission paperwork and the treasurer is listed as a Tom Fay of Laguna Beach, Calif.
On Oct. 23, Trump's campaign filed a letter with the FEC stating that the Committee to Restore America's Greatness and seven other super PACs were using Trump's name, image or slogan without authorization, which could confuse Trump's supporters. These actions came after The Washington Post reported that an operative running a pro-Trump super PAC called Make America Great Again had close ties to Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. In response, Make America Great Again shut down and Trump called on all super PACs raising money in his name to refund their contributions. Since then, the campaign has taken similar action against other super PACs.
"I am self-funding my campaign and therefore I will not be controlled by the donors, special interests and lobbyists who have corrupted our politics and politicians for far too long," Trump said at the time. "I have disavowed all Super PAC's, requested the return of all donations made to said PAC's, and I am calling on all presidential candidates to do the same."
Lewandowski said the campaign sent another letter to the Committee to Restore America's Greatness on Thursday and plans to file another complaint with the Federal Election Commission.
Stone writes on the super PAC's website -- as was first noted by the Wall Street Journal -- that while Trump needs to "run a campaign of ideas" and use his campaign funds to explain his vision for the country, there's a need to match the attack ads against Trump and educate voters on "the real Marco Rubio, his liberal voting record and limited experience." Stone writes that the super PAC "will not accept any corporate contributions from those trying to buy influence," and Stone told the Wall Street Journal the super PAC will be funded by "small contributions from average people." A contribution page on the group's website suggests donations ranging from $20 to $500, along with this option: "Or you can enter any amount!"
Stone is frequently on cable news and is prolific on Twitter, sometimes offering fashion tips amid streams of speculation. Stone's personal web page features a 6-minute reel of his 2015 television appearances that begins with several James-Bond-style photos of himself, including one in which he wears a white suit with a black bow tie and red carnation while holding a small handgun. Stone has written several books detailing some of his more elaborate conspiracy theories, including that Lyndon B. Johnson was a driving force in the murder of President John F. Kennedy. Stone published a book about the Clintons in October that alleges, among other things, that Chelsea Clinton is not Bill Clinton's daughter.
Stone has passionately supported and defended Trump, while skewering many of his rivals. Earlier this week, Stone tweeted: "That voice ! If @CarlyFiorina was my wife- i'd kill myself #screechy #shrill #ugh #CNNDebate."
The super PAC's website is highly simplistic and riddled with typos. Its homepage features photos of Trump and Rubio beneath this headline: "THE WASHINGTON DC INSIDERS, SPECIAL INTERESTS, LOBBYISTS AND A HANDFUL OF SELF INTERESTED BILLIONAIRES PLAN AN ALL-OUT PAID MEDIA ASSAULT TO DESTROY THE CANDIDACY OF DONALD TRUMP. WILL YOU HELP US STOP THEM?"
The site states that the "Republican establishment, the billionaires, the hedge fund managers, and the Wall Street interests" have abandoned former Florida governor Jeb Bush as their chosen nominee in favor of Rubio, who is described as "a wheel-dealer, who has played ball with the Obama administration on numerous issues such as immigration and trade." The site also features a "full letter" from Stone that details his background working on presidential campaigns and 37-year friendship with Trump.
"My knowledge of the presidential nominating process and my sources within the Republican Party are second to none," Stone writes.
Stone writes that the "Republican establishment is desperate to stop Trump" and will strike soon, warning in bold italics: "There is even talk of a Brokered Convention in which Party bosses would rig the rules to deny Donald Trump the Presidential nomination even if he arrives at the convention with more committed delegates than any other candidate."
The letter then details Rubio's record in the U.S. Senate, criticizes his campaign slogan, spreads a rumor that Mitt Romney might endorse Rubio and asks if the senator will "simply be a boy-toy for the billionaires." Stone then details what Trump would do as president, often in bold text, and notes that "Trump's call to make America great again has had enormous resonance with the voters." Stone asks for donations to fight attacks on Trump by Kasich and others, vowing to "begin contacting cable TV and radio stations in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina and making reservations for hard hitting ads exposing the myth of Marco Rubio within days."
The letter is signed by Stone -- who then adds a "P.S." that reiterates the need to act to overcome the "secret deal" and a "PPS" noting that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) might soon be a threat, accusing the governor of having a "pro-Islamic Extremist record."
"That's why it (sic.) so critical that you send your maximum contribution today!" the final line of the PPS says. "We will be ready to flood the radio and TV airways with the truth about Christie and Rubio!"

1. Revealing: A reputable Swiss weekly presented Koran verses that incite to violence against unbelievers –which means you, the world and me. The intent: show that violence in the name of God is not an error of confused followers.
The response of Islam experts: to read the Book, you need to be an expert. That confers power because you must believe what they say and not what you see.
The expert excuse for the inexcusable: The Prophet advocated and practiced what has been normal in his time in backward places. Also, Mohammed was under the pressure of enemies, which influenced his pronouncements. Does this mean that not God –who was hardly pressured- but a man, is the Book's source? Considering the factors of limited time and plenty of enemies, one wonders how violent Christ's should have been by that standard.
2. Muslim intolerance might not be of concern without its expanding communities in prosperous countries. The growth comes from the influx of persons who ask for refugee status. The self-imposed rules of the game mean that nearly everyone that demands refuge gets it. Those refused receive a “temporary” permit.
Some of these economic migrants command attention. While they demand tolerance, they show little of it for the false religion and sinful ways of their hosts. The high rate of criminality reflects this contempt. Another problem arises where communities are responsible for their finances and for welfare. Some refugees assigned to such places undermine the local budget. A report before the writer (10th December) tells the case of a small town in trouble. 70% of the settled refugees live off welfare –and 95% or the Eritreans depend on public support.
Are these people lazy? No, as a problem is that, being unwilling to adapt to their freely chosen milieu, they flaunt their “difference” demonstratively. Also, the newcomers lack skills. Post-industrial societies have limited needs for the unskilled.
3. One day Moscow will announce that new “color revolutions” in its “sphere of interest” will be considered as threats. Therefore, restorative intervention will be deemed legitimate. This is a significant impairment of sovereignty. Any success in the pursuit of that ambition will not satiate but create new appetites.
4. Statistics like to present the defense spending of countries expressed in dollars or as the percentage of GDPs. In these, thanks to its external guarantor of security, Europe is ranked low. The USA owes the top and entities such as Russia and China follow far behind. Doubting qualifications are needed. Budgets –the source of the data- can be manipulated by attributing military expenditures to other ministries. Mainly, however, the personnel costs of conscript armies are low. (When the People's Army drafted the writer, the sold was about a dollar on the black market.) Soldiers are, as in the case of America, expensive. That inflates the budget while the cheap draftees of other armies deflate the seeming costs of their armed forces.
5. “No school or kindergarten, no welfare money” is the policy of Hungary's PM, Victor Orbán. That reassures some that the man is a racist dictator. Indeed, there is a correlation between the measure and “race”. 10% of the country's population is Gypsies and, frequently, that community resists the schooling of its children. The result is a collective lack of skills and unemployment. That condition has one major advantage. A minority's joblessness can serve as proof of “racism”. This charge is a problem, but not a decisive one. Yet, unemployment siphons money out of the economy, which, if invested, could create additional “business” and prosperity.
There was a time when the privileged classes used their power to keep the disadvantaged from acquiring the skills needed for their rise. Today, some at the bottom need to be forced to qualify themselves for mobility. Who has an interest in a caste-like underclass? It is their pro leaders that can mobilize the dependent.
6. Observed: The poorer a society, the more it will hate the successful that it sees as undeservedly rich. Or is it possible that the equation should be reversed? The more achievement is met with suspicion –as in “property is theft”- the more likely that historical poverty will be projected into modern times.
7. Another misconception pertains to the nexus between poverty and the belief that success comes from hurting others. Nations that believe them to have been unjustly treated can proceed from there to a dangerous conclusion. It is that their victimhood mutated into moral superiority. Absolution “in reserve” can, in turn, justify any action taken to the detriment of others. The movements that gave us mass murder operated on this basis. Nazism exploited the abuse of a weak Germany by foreign powers and taught that “wage and interest slavery” came from a Jewish conspiracy. An ideological postulate of Communism is the exploitation of the working class that results in a struggle in which the victor exterminates the defeated. Once you accept such tales, the GULAG and “Auschwitz” appear as morally justified.
Thus: once victims acquire power, they will not necessarily be benign rulers.
8. Venezuela's Maduro has produced a quotable. He called sanctions “stupid” and told that they will not undo his government. Actually, if sanctions are stupid, then Caracas should welcome them. The wasted effort will weaken the Yankee imperialists and accelerate capitalism's collapse and the triumph of Socialism. The suspicion that logic is not Maduro's forte is supported by the fact that, regardless of the pretended irrelevance of sanctions, they are resented. The “no harm to us” claim weakens when the dysfunction of the economy is blamed on American sanctions.
9. Attorneys needed. The mass of Islamist fighters returning to Western states grows. So will their attempt to violently undermine their hosts. Thus, two concepts clash.
One is that rights include the right to citizenship and residence. Guilt is when laws are violated and sanctions may only follow deeds. This protects returning terrorists who claim to have studied the culture of the Near East. If the evidence contradicts that, one is recast as an inquisitive youth exploited by propagandists.
The other concept is that society's survival overrides individual interest. Obligatory military service restricts those that hate to get up in the morning. However, the need to defend the public justifies it. The prevention of terrorism by returnees demands that residency rights and especially irrevocable acquired citizenship be reconsidered. Furthermore, the concepts of guilt, criminality, and responsibility for membership in criminal organizations, must be re-thought.
Community rights and the government's duty to protect its people rates higher than shielding hostiles from the inconvenience of jail or deportation.
10. We heard that 140+ lives were lost when the Taliban attacked a school. A commentator asked, “Why have they done that?” The answer is simple: “Because they like to kill”.
Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas said on Tuesday that he will maintain the current freeze on any coordination with Israel, despite the removal of controversial metal detectors at the highly sensitive Jerusalem holy site.
"Unless all measures go back to what they were before July 14, there will not be any changes," Abbas said in a speech ahead of a meeting with the Palestinian leadership of the date Israel temporarily closed the site after an attack that killed two policemen.
The statement comes just after US special envoy to the Middle East Jason Greenblatt met with the Palestinian president in an effort to mediate the escalation of violence and tension in recent weeks.
Abbas froze contacts with Israel last week over the dispute, including security coordination, and said Tuesday it would continue "unless all measures go back to what they were before July 14".
Israel's security cabinet announced the decision to remove the detectors early on Tuesday.
The government said it would introduce subtler measures to secure the compound housing the revered Al-Aqsa mosque and Dome of the Rock following a July 14 deadly attack on Israeli police nearby.
Crews removed the metal detectors early Tuesday, and cameras installed in recent days were also gone.
But suspicions over what the new measures would entail resulted in the boycott continuing.
They decided "to change the inspection with metal detectors to a security inspection based on advanced technologies and other means," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said.
Details of the advanced technologies envisaged were not immediately clear.
At this time last year, we were on RadioShack Bankruptcy Watch, waiting for the venerable electronics retailer to file for Chapter 11 protection. Would it mean the end of RadioShack stores nationwide, or would the brand survive? One of the company's major creditors purchased around half of the chain's stores, creating a new company that would buy the RadioShack name in the bankruptcy auction, and the new RadioShack hired a former Dell executive as CEO in April. Now CEO Ron Garriques is taking off.
The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports that he is leaving, along with the company's Chief Revenue Officer, Marty Amschler. The duties of that job are going to two other executives, a vice president of stores and a vice president of store operations.
While the company searches for a new CEO, the chief financial officer, Gordon Briscoe, will step in. RadioShack told the Star-Telegram that Garriques stepped down “to pursue other interests in a role that will put him back closer to his family.” That could be in Austin, where Dell is based, or it could just be a classic reason given now that his work slimming down the Shack is done.

“I can't stand art actually. I've never, ever liked art.” So the artist David Hammons told the art historian Kellie Jones in a 1986 interview. Then why do you make it? Ms. Jones asked. Because, Mr. Hammons offered, art is about symbols and “outrageously magical things happen when you mess around with a symbol.” Precisely such things are happening in the exhibition “David Hammons: Five Decades” at Mnuchin Gallery.
At the time of the interview Mr. Hammons was already a star, known for his formal and conceptual brilliance and his unpredictable ways. At various points in the 1980s, he sold snowballs on a sidewalk near the Bowery, erected three-story-high basketball hoops in Brooklyn, and made sculptures from hair swept from Harlem barber shop floors. He was creating — in public places with found materials for non-art-world audiences — odd, witty, barely graspable objects that were also emblems of wealth, class and race. And after making them, he'd change course, and location, or disappear, following a career GPS of his own.
Click here for some of the early offers made on the offensive side of the football!
Keisean Lucier-South, Orange (Ca.) Lutheran defensive end: Oregon will have some ground to make up to battle with the traditional powers. Notre Dame, Texas, USC and UCLA are some of the best schools.
Arden Key, Atlanta (Ga.) Hapeville Charter defensive end: SEC schools will probably have the inside track on Key.
Byron Cowart, Seffner (Fl.) Armwood defensive end: Oregon will try to pry Cowart out of the South, particularly against a school like Florida. The Ducks are in the mix .
Daylon Mack, Gladewater (Tx.) defensive tackle: Mack is already committed to Texas A&M, so the Ducks are probably going to have trouble here.
Jacob Daniel, Clovis (Ca.) North defensive tackle: Daniel was a Tosh Lupoi target, but that ship has sailed.
Cecil Cherry, Frostproof (Fl.) linebacker: Cherry is currently committed to Tennessee.
Jeffrey Holland, Jacksonville (Fl.) Trinity Christian Academy linebacker: There are a lot of SEC and ACC schools in the mix.
Montrell Curtis, Hampton (Ga.) Lovejoy cornerback: Curtis is currently committed to Kentucky.
Maurice Smitherman, Adamsville (Al.) Minor cornerback: Oregon has extended plenty of offers to Southern schools, which means they have a lot of competition for all these players. There will be far more offers coming down the road.

Got fresh peaches, right off the tree? If you do, then it's probably prime grilling season too. How about whipping up this sassy sauce, then using it to baste your favorite grilled meats?
Vegetarian or vegan? This recipe is perfect for you too. Grilled Tempeh with Peach Chipotle BBQ Sauce? Mmmm. (If you're gluten-intolerant, I've read that both San Marcos and La Costena-brand chipotles are gluten-free.)
In this recipe I created one of my favorite flavor profiles: Sweet & Spicy. I started to say "this is a fun project" but then I realized I say that a lot...but it's true. It's pretty darn easy to make Peach Chipotle BBQ Sauce if you have the ingredients on hand, of course. Do yourself a favor and keep a can of chipotle chiles in your pantry. After tasting this, I have a hunch you'll find other ways to use them.
2 lbs fresh peaches (about 5 medium peaches)
(about 5 medium peaches) 2 chipotle chiles with adobo sauce (from a can)
(from a can) 1 lime , juiced
, juiced 1/4 cup bottled lemon juice
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
2 TBS agave nectar or honey
1 TBS ground cumin
1 TBS smoked paprika
1 tsp (or more) sea salt
Note: Prepare canning jars before starting your preserving project.
1.) Blanch & peel peaches, then cut peaches in half and remove pits.
2.) Chop into chunks; put peach chunks in a blender or food processor.
3.) Remove chipotle chiles from can, slice in half, then remove the seeds and discard them. (Chiles will be in adobo sauce. Don't remove the flavorful sauce that clings to them; instead try to keep as much of it as possible and add it to the peach mixture.) Add the halved chiles - with their sauce - to the blender (or food processor).
4.) Add lime juice, lemon juice and all other remaining ingredients, then process until the mixture is smooth.
5.) Pour peach mixture into a heavy-bottomed nonreactive pan, cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Lift lid and stir occasionally to be sure it isn't sticking to the bottom of the pan. The main reason for covering the peach mixture is to prevent burns & stains from the simmering sauce, which has a tendency to splatter.
6.) Taste sauce and add more salt, if needed.
7.) Ladle into jars, and process for 10 minutes in a Boiling Water Bath.
Alternately you can store the sauce tightly covered in your refrigerator for up to 3 months or in your freezer for 6 months.

An employee works in the Yelp Inc. offices in Chicago, Illinois, March 5, 2015. REUTERS/Jim Young Yelp shares tanked 28% on Wednesday after the company slashed its outlook for full-year earnings.
In second-quarter results released Tuesday, Yelp said it expected net revenues to be between $544 million and $550 million, which would be 54% higher year-over-year. Adjusted earnings are expected to be between $72 million and $78 million.
The business ratings and reviews platform lowered its outlook "based on slower sales headcount growth and the elimination of its brand advertising product."
Deutsche Bank analysts slashed their price target on the stock to $26 from $33, with a "hold" rating, in a note Wednesday. They mentioned that there was growing competition for Yelp's sales force and that the company had slowed down hiring.
As for its most recent performance, the company posted revenues of $133.9 million, ahead of the consensus estimate for $133.5 million according to Bloomberg. Yelp posted a loss of 2 cents, worse than the estimate for 1 cent. Adjusted Q2 earnings per share came in at $0.12, versus the forecast for $0.16.
Mobile unique visitors to the site exceeded desktop uniques for the first time, up 22% year-over-year and averaging 83 million per month, Yelp said.
"Consumers are increasingly turning to apps when using their mobile phones, and we are excited about the growth we've seen in app usage, which accelerated to 51% year-over-year," CEO Jeremy Stoppelman said in the statement.
Yelp announced during the conference call that chairman Max Levchin would be stepping down to go after other interests.
Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that Yelp was not looking to sell itself after being approached by several companies.
Yelp shares are down 54% year-to-date and 64% over the past 12 months.
Here's a 12-month look at the stock:
A senior Hamas official called for dialogue with Syria to restore ties severed by the Palestinian Islamist movement's alleged support for rebels fighting to overthrow President Bashar Assad's regime. Raafat Murra, Hamas' political representative in Beirut, also vehemently denied reports of a break in the movement's relations with Hezbollah, stressing that the two groups are united over the Palestinian cause and resistance against Israeli occupation.
Damascus had hosted Khaled Meshaal, chief of Hamas' political bureau, along with senior Hamas officials, for more than a decade until the outbreak of the anti-regime uprising in March 2011 .
Hamas has been accused of fighting Assad's forces in Palestinian refugee camps in Syria, particularly the Yarmouk camp, a charge the group has denied.
Similarly, Hamas' relations with its traditional backer Iran have been soured by the Syrian conflict.
Hamas has for months trumpeted an upcoming visit to Tehran by Meshaal for talks with Iranian leaders on mending ties.
Murra strongly denied reports that Hamas had fought alongside anti-regime rebels in Syria.
Murra called for dialogue between Hamas and Damascus to mend fences, saying his group recognized Syria's geographical importance to Palestine.

I remember the first time I ever saw a $100 bill.
It was back in the early 80s, I must have only been 5 or 6 years old. My parents took my sister and I to a fancy restaurant, and I distinctly remember a man dressed in a dark business suit a few tables over paying his bill with a crisp $100 note. He pulled it out of his wallet, slid it onto the table, and walked away.
I was dumbfounded. It was more money than I had ever seen in my young life.
None of my friends had ever seen a $100 bill, and I was the big news at school the next day, regaling the whole class with stories of my proximity to such vast wealth. Of course, back then, a $100 bill truly was a rare sighting because prices were so much lower. A can of Campbell's soup was 25 cents. Today it costs 4x as much. A movie ticket ran about $3.50, according to the National Association of Theater Owners. Today it's almost to $9. Gasoline was 86 cents per gallon. Now it's $2.20, and that's after a major price collapse. $100 could practically pay the rent in a lot of places back in the 80s.
That's obviously no longer the case. Even a mundane trip to the grocery store can easily blow through $100 without feeling unusual. $100 simply isn't the awe-inspiring symbol of wealth that it used to be. And that's because of inflation. One measure of this trend is the average lifespan of the $100 bill.
As money changes hands during routine transactions, the constant wear and tear eventually starts to break down the paper. You probably have a few bills in your wallet that look like they're about to disintegrate. The more frequently a bill is used, the faster that breakdown occurs. According to the Federal Reserve, for example, a typical $1 bill lasts for about 5.8 years before becoming so fragile that it gets withdrawn from circulation and destroyed.
A $100 bill, on the other hand, lasts for 15.0 years. This makes sense given that a $1 bill is used so much more frequently. But what's interesting is that, even as late as 2011, the average $100 bill lasted 21.6 years before becoming worn out. So according to Federal Reserve data, the average lifespan of a $100 bill has fallen by more than 30% over the last several years.
This is primarily due to a significant increase in use, i.e. $100 bills are used more frequently in day-to-day transactions… at the gas station, grocery store, and even coffee shop.
Naturally, this increased use of the $100 bill is because prices are higher than they've ever been– you can't pay the grocery bill anymore with a twenty. Wages and salaries have also increased over time. But not as fast as living costs. According to the US Department of Labor, most people are still earning less than they were 17-years ago when adjusted for inflation. And that's precisely the point: inflation is a very deliberate and sustained form of theft. When prices rise faster than income levels, they're ultimately stealing from your standard of living. But not just once.
Inflation steals from you month after month, year after year. It never stops. This has long been a common tactic for financially desperate governments throughout history. Think about it– if they sent gun-toting police to your house demanding 2% of your wealth, there would be rioting in the streets. But if the government and central bank engineer 2% inflation, no one cares. And that's the really amazing thing about inflation: governments and academia have managed to convince people that a little bit of inflation is totally normal. They start early, even teaching students this garbage in high school economics classes.
Of course, they always forget to teach the part about how destructive inflation is over time.
2% inflation compounded year after year can have an explosive effect, doubling, tripling, and quadrupling prices. The thing is, though, because inflation occurs so gradually, it feels ‘normal'.Only when we look back to the past can we see how dramatically inflation has changed people's lives.
The US Labor Department reports, for example, that in the late 1960s, fewer than half of households with children were dual income. In other words, one parent supported the family on a single income. Today in nearly 70% of households with children, BOTH parents have to work in order to make ends meet. Just like the dramatic decline in the purchasing power of a $100 bill, this trend is a prime example of how inflation steals from people over time.
Policymakers will always downplay inflation.
Back in 2011 Federal Reserve official Bill Dudley infamously responded to soaring food prices by citing the fact that an iPad 2 was cheaper than an iPad 1. (Prompting one reporter to say, “I can't eat an iPad!”) They may even reinvent the way they calculate inflation. But despite the speeches and statistics, most of which focus on monthly or quarterly changes, the long-term effects of inflation are very much with us.
And they aren't going away.
It would be foolish to assume that the people who are causing this problem will suddenly fix it. If anything, they'll make it worse. In fact, central bankers around the world have been concerned that inflation isn't high enough… as if a brief period of price stability is somehow a bad thing. We should absolutely expect higher inflation.
Central bankers want inflation. Governments want inflation. And they're the ones who have the power to make it happen.
Real assets, like precious metals, productive real estate, profitable businesses, etc. offer safety from inflation, especially if your savings is denominated in an overvalued paper currency. More on that later in the week.
The Barcelona Provincial High Court in Spain rejected an appeal filed by the lawyers of Barcelona forward Lionel Messi to drop tax fraud charges against him, reports El País.
Messi could face a fine of up to €24 million ($31.274 million) and up to five years in prison if found guilty of the charges.
The court said they believed there is evidence to support claims that Messi knowingly benefited from the creation of companies by his father in several countries which allowed him to skip out on payments of €4.1 million ($5.5 million) to the Spanish Tax Agency between 2007 and 2009.
The court ruled that they will decide during a hearing whether Messi had knowledge of the fraud scheme, meaning that he and his father will remain under investigation for three counts of tax fraud.
Messi has denied any wrongdoing, saying in June 2013 when the charges were announced, “We have always fulfilled all our tax obligations, following the advices of our tax consultants who will take care of clarifying this situation.”
Messi's father did pay $6.6 million to cover unpaid taxes plus interest last August, but the charges were not dropped despite two subsequent appeals.
His lawyers have attempted to have Messi removed from the case, but one judge responded by saying that for this type of crime, it wasn't necessary for someone to have knowledge of all business practices, but “it is sufficient to be aware of the designs to commit fraud and consent to them.”

Filipino hospitality went on overdrive the other night at the Asean Summit gala dinner and surely impressed the visiting heads of state who spent most of their time indoors, shielded from the traffic, noise and humidity that Filipinos endure daily. Justin Trudeau stole the show simply by being easy on the eyes in contrast to Donald Trump struggling to maintain a smile on a disagreeable face, if only to distract Pinoys from noticing his ill-fitting barong Tagalog with sleeves a tad too long. If we are to gloss over Lapu-Lapu killing our first tourist, and Humabon slaughtering the remainder of the stragglers from Mactan during a postbattle dinner, we can begin a brief history of Filipino hospitality from 1521 to Asean 2017.
Pompas, solemnidades, exposiciones, ferias, festejos, festividades and celebraciones are but some of the keywords that indicate the content of bundles in the National Archives of the Philippines that a historian should mine to recreate the various feasts that make for Filipino hospitality in the Spanish colonial period. The document bundles I have gone through cover the 19th century, mostly requests for religious fiestas and some on private parties, as well as information on appropriate music for funerals! Permits provided local government with fiesta revenue and relieved paranoid officials that a large group of people gathering was not a rebellion.

Documentation on three royal visits to Manila are available, namely: the Duque de Hedimburgo in 1869, and the Duque de Genova and the Grand Duke Alexis of Russia in the 1880s. Manila played host to only one king, Norodom I of Cambodia, who visited in 1872, months after the execution of the priests Gomez, Burgos and Zamora. Archival material is so detailed with individual receipts for all the expenses for the visit: materials for triumphal arches, cloth for festoons and banderitas, food and drink, so a good time could be had by all. Norodom was so impressed with Filipino hospitality he ordered one of his ministers to ask the Spanish governor general for a complete list of everyone who had contributed to the success of the visit. Norodom later rained on all these individuals various medals and ribbons of the kingdom's state decorations.
Spanish kings and queens in Madrid were so remote to their subjects half a world away. Laws and proclamations were made in their name, their birthdays celebrated and funerals mourned with appropriate pomp in Spanish Manila but they were all but imaginary because no Spanish king had set foot in the colony from 1565, when Miguel Lopez de Legazpi took possession of the islands, until Intramuros was surrendered to the Americans in August 1898. In the library of the Royal Palace in Madrid is a document that narrates one of the strangest events in our shared history.
Textbook history records that our founding fathers established the First Republic in Malolos, the first in Southeast Asia, but glosses over the fact that we were practically the last of the Spanish colonies to declare independence unlike those in Latin America that freed themselves by 1825. Ferdinand VII wanted to reward the Philippines for its loyalty to the crown, after all, Philip II on June 21, 1574, conferred on Manila the title “Insigne y siempre leal” marking it as an “illustrious and ever-loyal” city. Since Ferdinand VII could not thank his loyal subjects in person, he commissioned a full-length portrait from the court painter Vicente Lopez and sent it to Manila. The royal portrait arrived in October 1825, in a box draped with heavy black cloth together with the effects of Mariano Ricafort, newly minted governor general. In December, Ricafort arranged for the king's portrait that had been installed in the salon of the Administracion de la Rentas del Vino in Binondo to be transferred and solemnly installed at the Ayuntamiento.
Ferdinand VII was not in Manila in person, but his portrait was the next best thing, greeted along the way by a cheering crowd estimated in the thousands. Ricafort declared a general amnesty first to military and later to civil prisoners declogging prisons and putting them in the king's debt. This document in Madrid, complete with watercolors of the various floats and decorations, saw the hospitality unfurled not for a real person but a picture.

BRASILIA, Brazil, April 15 (UPI) -- Leaders of Brazil, India, Russia and China gathered in the Brazilian capital Thursday to advance talks for what the four nations see as a multipolar world -- interdependent but largely away from a Western umbrella.
The leaders of the four major economies grouped under the BRIC banner will be talking about alternatives to the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency, their own respective roles in the world economy and greater say in whatever evolves as a new economic order on the ruins of the 2008 economic meltdown.
Brazil and India also want their economic presence reflected in permanent membership of the U.N. Security Council, where China and Russia already have permanent seats.
BRIC nations represent about 40 percent of the world's population and 20 percent of global economic output but, as a group, they are just beginning to flex their muscle, after the first summit of the four in Russia last year.
Other major emerging economies, such as South Korea and South Africa, are watching the group's rise with interest, as are oil-producing countries that include some of the world's biggest spenders with the least political leverage.
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is playing host to Chinese President Hu Jintao, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. South African President Jacob Zuma is also attending.
At the first BRIC summit in 2009 in Russia, BRIC leaders advanced their own recipes for a global economic overhaul that included finding alternatives to the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency.
The Obama administration's attention is focused on Chinese moves on the yuan, which is pegged to the dollar and is crucial to keeping China's exports attractive for the rest of the world.
Economists attending a BRIC seminar in Brasilia said trade between the four countries helped to stabilize their economies amid a continuing global economic downturn.
The speakers cited figures to show that trade among the four nations continued to grow as global trade shrank in volume, the Xinhua Chinese news agency reported.
Biswat Dhar of the Indian Research and Investigation Center said the "BRIC countries have put the crisis behind them." The need now, he added, was to find more "export synergies to increase trade engagement."
During the nine years ending 2008, trade within the four-nation group grew nine-fold, while global trade only doubled, said Zhang Yuyang, professor of international economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
"Even so, trade between the BRICs has substantial room to develop," Zhang said.

Recent outbreaks of a sickness known as the Zika virus have sparked hysteria across the globe, and many reports have actually indicated that this is likely a man-made disaster, as the origin of Zika itself is somewhat strange.
The virus was “discovered” in 1947, however, it was not discovered in the wild nor did it spontaneously arise. In fact, it was discovered by Rockefeller Foundation scientists in a monkey that they had in captivity, leading many to believe that this was the result of some type of experiment. Since then, cases of Zika have been extremely rare, but in the past few years, outbreaks of Zika have been on the rise, especially in South America and specifically Brazil.
Oddly, the recent outbreak in Brazil coincides with the release of genetically modified mosquitoes in 2012, by the British biotech company Oxitec. Not only did the new outbreak occur just after the release, but it also occurred in the same area.
Zika Outbreak Epicenter in Same Area Where GM Mosquitoes Were Released in 2015 https://t.co/PqLZQtgik2pic.twitter.com/lUd6kEjXeI — Anti-Media (@AntiMedia) January 31, 2016
Ironically enough, the GM mosquitos were actually proposed as a solution to infectious disease, but many experts warned that there was not enough research and that a release of such an organism into the wild could have disastrous consequences.
As news of Zika spread this week, rumors also reached the internet that the virus was available for purchase online. Sure enough, there is actually a sale listing for Zika online through a website called atcc.org, where a number of different viruses and biological agents are sold to research teams. For the sake of investigation, the Free Thought Project tried to go through the application process that was required to buy the virus, just to see if anyone with $516 to spend would be able to get their hands on it.
In case there are people out there who think this may be a ‘conspiracy theory,' you can plainly see that the source for the Zika virus is, in fact, from J. Casals, Rockefeller Foundation, and sourced from Blood from experimental forest sentinel rhesus monkey, Uganda, 1947.
After initially trying to buy the virus, we were prompted to create a user account on the website. After that, we were led through a dozen pages of forms, where we were asked information about our organization, tax ID # and the biosafety level of our lab. While this seems to be tight security, we were able to input false information and fudge the requirements to complete the application process. We are still waiting for our application to be approved, but we did not have to upload any type of proof that we are a legitimate facility.
It seems that while the virus is available online, it is not extremely easy to get, and would likely require some extremely creative fraud in order to make it happen. However, it definitely does seem that it would be possible for a group or individual that is determined enough to make their way through the website's security measures.

Step aside tech startups: The Belmont Goats have turned to crowdsourcing to help with the move to their new home.
The Belmont Goats
The herd's caretakers are asking for the public's help on Indiegogo to cover $7,500 in moving expenses. The 60-day campaign has raised about $600 since its launch Sunday night.
The money will cover insurance, a use permit and construction on the goats' future plot in Lents neighborhood — a move that was approved by Portland Development Commission.
Contributors to the cause are promised perks like a bumper sticker or a photo of “your fave goat.” A $250-contribution will get you an in-home visit if you live in Portland, but keep in mind that goats will eat anything and everything.
The goats must move from the Belmont site because landowner and developer Killian Pacific wants to break ground on a long-anticipated retail and apartment project and there isn't any space for the animals.
There are 14 goats among the herd and caretakers want to keep them together and accessible to the public. The urban herd has been living on a vacant lot on SE 10th and Belmont in Portland since October 2012.
Before they moved in, rented herds were brought in the vacant lot to clear the grass starting in 2010. A business owner across the street got approval from the landowner for a permanent herd. He then bought his own goats and recruited caretakers — the rest is history.

Mayo Clinic, one of the country's top hospitals, is in the midst of controversy after its CEO said that the elite medical facility would prioritize the care of patients with private health insurance over those with Medicare and Medicaid.
The prioritization by the Rochester, MN-headquartered medical practice was recently revealed by the Minneapolis Star Tribune. And it has quickly drawn out some sharp critics—as well as sympathizers.
In a statement to the Minnesota Post Bulletin, Dr. Gerard Anderson, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Hospital Finance and Management, compared the prioritization to policies seen in developing countries. "This is what happens in many low-income countries. The health system is organized to give the most affluent preference in receiving health care,” he wrote.
Likewise, Minnesota Department of Human Services Commissioner Emily Piper, expressed surprise and concern by the statements of Mayo's CEO, Dr. John Noseworthy. "Fundamentally, it's our expectation at DHS that Mayo Clinic will serve our enrollees in public programs on an equal standing with any other Minnesotan that walks in their door," she said. "We have a lot of questions for Mayo Clinic about how and if and through what process this directive from Dr. Noseworthy is being implemented across their health system."
Specifically, Noseworthy said in a video to Mayo employees late last year:
We're asking… if the patient has commercial insurance, or they're Medicaid or Medicare patients and they're equal, that we prioritize the commercial insured patients enough so… we can be financially strong at the end of the year.
In statements, Mayo has confirmed Noseworthy's prioritization and added that about 50 percent of its patients are beneficiaries of government programs. "Balancing payer mix is complex and isn't unique to Mayo Clinic. It affects much of the industry, but it's often not talked about. That's why we feel it is important to talk transparently about these complex issues with our staff."
Mayo can use its standing as a prestigious institution to negotiate higher prices with commercial insurance companies, but it can't do the same with the government. As such, those with private insurance can bring more money to the hospital than patients with the same treatments on government programs. Under the ACA, the number of people covered by Medicare and Medicaid has expanded. However, the law also decreased the number of uninsured, which can be costly to hospitals.
In his speech, Noseworthy said that Mayo had reached a “tipping point” with a recent 3.7 percent surge in Medicaid patients. “If we don't grow the commercially insured patients, we won't have income at the end of the year to pay our staff, pay the pensions, and so on,” he said. “So we're looking for a really mild or modest change of a couple percentage points to shift that balance.”
Nevertheless, the nonprofit still generated substantial profits in 2016: $475 million.
Other experts expressed sympathy with the hospital's perspective. Daniel Polsky, a health economist at the University of Pennsylvania, told STAT that Mayo shouldn't be chided for the blunt revelation. “I don't think they should be shamed for saying it,” he said. “I think there should be some public discussion about whether elite systems such as Mayo should provide equal access to all payer types. I don't know the answer to that, but it's a reasonable debate.”
This past week the College of Arts & Sciences Student Council received a plan to increase the A&S Course Fee to $60 per credit hour. They are standing to make $3.1 million from this increase, but at what cost to the students? This change would have impacted more than 9,000 students who would have to pay anywhere from $500-$1000 more in fees each semester. This fee is also recurring from year to year. Each year the fee will increase due to another decision by UMKC administrators. They haven't informed any of their students of this proposal either, not even so much as a courtesy email or letter in the mail. PYO-KC as an organization flyered and posted information surrounding the town hall and imploring students to be involved to oppose administration and the CSA student council's proposal.
The financial strain that this proposal puts on students is immense. A large amount of students who go to UMKC already rely on scholarships with many having to take out thousands of dollars in loans on top of those inadequate scholarships. UMKC students are forced to work long hours at local businesses, rely on their family, and sacrifice study time to pay for rising tuition costs. Nevertheless, we have won a concrete victory last night in regards to the proposed tuition hike on behalf of working class and oppressed nationality students. Last night at the University of Missouri-Kansas-City town hall meeting about the recent proposal to increase tuition we mustered up our forces. What we found was the scheduled town hall was to be held in a pathetically small room in the Administration building that could have fit no more than 30 people, our organization composed more than half of those in attendance nevertheless. We voiced our opposition in many ways, which the administration and College of Arts and Sciences student council was ill-prepared for.
First and foremost we were there to stand up for the working class and oppressed nationality student body of UMKC. The College of Arts and Sciences is the largest college in UMKC and the proposal would increase tuition by nearly $1,000 per semester for over 9,000 students, close to 60% of students. Many of whom already have to take out thousands in subsidized and unsubsidized loans. When asked about this issue the President of the Student Council for the College of Arts and Sciences said “There have not. Umm, I think we are basing it on the current tuition model and the, the, need based scholarships and what not.” This is not a response and is indicative of how little research and time went into putting this proposal together. To add further insult to injury a position that was supposed to filled by a graduate student to promote diversity on campus was sacked after it was stated that “racism doesn't exist at UMKC”. This in a city that is 1/3 Black, and in a University that sits on the Troost Avenue line separating Black and White Kansas City, but that has only 12% Black students enrolled. Already in the state of Missouri undocumented students are being denied in-state tuition for Missouri Universities and college campuses through legal manipulation in the appropriations education bill HB 2003. To say no racism exists when such racist “coincidences” are occurring is nothing short of a joke.
When pressed further about the impact this proposal would have on low income communities and especially students of color. Associate Dean Kruger said “We expect this to be an additional burden to all students, there's not doubt, but this is for you to decide.” This only reinforces our fact based arguments about the negative impact this proposal would have on working class and poor students. Floundered and flabbergasted that they have received such poignant resistance to this hike the administration and CSA student council postponed the proposal indefinitely.
There are a few lessons and successes we learned from this town hall.
First, UMKC students have shown that they are not going to submit to an administration that wants to increase the burden of paying for college. This is important as our resolve must be stronger than our opponents if we are to lead and participate protracted struggles that cannot be won overnight. Until the fulfillment of our platform is met we are at constant threat and at the mercy of the ruling class to strangle us by the neck as they continue to profit off of our desire and right to higher education. Until we win not only free tuition but an open university we will continue to struggle.
Second, Our collective opposition to the proposal has forced the deadline back INDEFINITELY. This in real terms is the most substantial victory that PYO-KC has had in it's existence, one that only seeks to solidify our resolve to advance the struggle. It is also a confirmation that our method of combining political-ideological theory with practice and not mere activism has raised the qualitative and quantitative abilities of our organization. In order to serve the people and to take up their struggles it is imperative that we are able to show some material benefits to taking up struggle. We wholeheartedly embrace our slogan “Dare to Struggle, Dare to Win” and the dreams of a better world and constructing it as the motivation for organizing young people.
Third, the student population of UMKC is becoming more aware of the power that collective action holds in relation to fighting for our rights. It is clear that administration officials were not capable of dealing with this as it has not been a problem to them before. However, just as we are able to learn, so can they. Last night was a resounding success, but the fight does not stop here. Next week there is going to be another town hall that will be open to anyone coming its is to be scheduled on Thursday September 22 . We need as many people there as possible to really hit home our opposition and kill this proposal once and for all. We will be sending out more information on the event before hand so keep a look out!
We urge all students to share this statement, to tell their friends and fellow students that we must fight this hike!

Red Hat's Ceph is a popular software-defined object and file cloud storage stack. Now Red Hat is moving forward with its latest release: Red Hat Ceph Storage 2,
This product is based on the Ceph Jewel release. This edition comes with several new capabilities to enhance object storage workloads storage and promote greater ease of use. These include support for CephFS. This is a POSIX-compliant file-system that uses a Ceph Storage Cluster to store data,
In Red Hat Ceph Storage 2, CephFS is a tech preview. It can also be used with the OpenStack infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud Manila shared file system service.
Ceph is important because it enables you to run software-defined storage to a petabyte and beyond on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware. With Ceph, you don't need to rely on a specific storage solution technology. Indeed you can mix and match storage from multiple vendors.
Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 also brings enhanced capabilities for enterprise object storage customers who are demanding scale, increased security, and strong compatibility with industry-standard Application Programming Interfaces (API)s.
New Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 object storage features include:
New global object storage clusters, which provide a single namespace and data synchronization between clusters operating in multiple regions.
Improved security via integration with authentication systems, including Active Directory, LDAP, and OpenStack Identity (Keystone) v3.
Enhanced Amazon S3 and OpenStack Object Storage (Swift) compatibility, including support for AWS v4 Client Signatures, object versioning, bulk deletes, and more.
To make all this easier to manage, Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 also debuts Red Hat Storage Console 2. This is a storage management and monitoring system with a redesigned, streamlined user interface.
Red Hat claims that the new Red Hat Storage Console 2 simplifies both Ceph deployment and operational management. This means that you can reduce deployment time from days to hours. This works because the Storage Console uses the Ansible DevOps tools as its foundation.
Red Hat's storage partners are lining up behind this release.

Gary Lyng, Western Digital's senior director of DCS Marketing, claims that:
Sandisk has performed an expansive amount of performance characterization testing with Red Hat targeted for Red Hat Ceph Storage deployments that need higher IOPS. The latest testing of InfiniFlash System IF150 by Sandisk with Red Hat Ceph Storage has shown it can provide more than one million random read IOPS - opening up a whole new set of potential workloads for private cloud and scale out storage.
Jyeh Gan, Director of Dell Extreme Scale Infrastructure Product Management & Strategy, wrote:
Next week at Red Hat Summit in San Francisco, we'll be taking the wraps off our latest open-source storage solution featuring the DSS 7000 storage server and Red Hat Ceph Storage 2. We built the DSS 7000 to deliver maximum density and performance by packing ninety 3.5" drives into a single 4U chassis, available as either 1 or 2 addressable servers, delivering up to 720 TB of storage capacity using today's 8 TB drives. Coupled with Red Hat's latest release of Ceph, the DSS 7000 truly shines for high-capacity object and archival storage. Customers looking to enable scale-out clouds in their own datacenters can simplify the management of their Ceph environment via the new Ansible-based Red Hat Storage Console 2.
Sounds like the storage you need for your enterprise and cloud? Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 is scheduled for availability this summer.

Trump has used his Twitter as his weapon of choice in a war of words with Kim in recent months, often tweeting threats and warnings to North Korea after a missile test. The most recent missile test took place on Thursday when the North Koreans shot a ballistic missile more than 2,000 miles into the Pacific Ocean.
The White House later released a readout of the call, saying in a statement the two leaders talked about the launch.
"The two leaders noted that North Korea continues to defy the international community, even after the United Nations strongly condemned North Korea's repeated provocations twice in the past week," the statement read.
"President Trump and President Moon committed to continuing to take steps to strengthen deterrence and defense capabilities and to maximize economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea."
Trump also spent some of Sunday morning retweeting praise and memes from his supporters.
He later touted his schedule for the day.
"Important meetings and calls scheduled for today. Military and economy are getting stronger by the day, and our enemies know it. #MAGA," Trump tweeted.
I n yesterday's Ask Wizards question, Magic Creative Director Brady Dommermuth explained the flavor relationship between a player, his hand, and his library of spells. It's not the first time that someone has undertaken the challenge of explaining the flavor of such abstract game concepts and mechanics, however.
Below is a document written by Daneen McDermott, formerly of the Magic Continuity Team, on July 27, 2000 (during the design of the "graveyard matters" Odyssey block). It attempts to explain, in analogical terms, what it means for a card to be in your library, for you to play a spell, for a card to end up in your graveyard, and other, more exotic variations possible in Magic.
While this should not be considered the authoritative canon on the subject, it is one interesting way of looking at the flavor of these real-world game mechanics.
Without further adieu, we present: Magic spellcasting as cake-baking.

The Ultimate Cake Example
(Wherein, the "Bake a Cake" Card has the Flashback ability, which is used after it is Milled...)
I know how to bake a cake (The "Bake A Cake" card in your library)
I remember baking the cake, but there's no cake?!? (Someone mills the "Bake A Cake" card into your Graveyard)
I really, really remember baking that cake, and I can do it again from memory (Paying the Flashback cost and playing the card again)
Cake? What Cake? (The "Bake A Cake" Card is purged after it has been played through Flashback)
It may not answer all flavor questions about basic Magic mechanics, but it's an interesting analogy using the relatively familiar concepts of knowledge (cards in your library), memory (cards in your graveyard), and physical results (the effects of spells you've previously cast). When you sit down to reason out the flavor of a Golgari mage dredging back a Life from the Loam dumped into his graveyard by his Dimir opponent by Glimpse the Unthinkable, however, remember that cake might not explain all of Magic's intricacies!
What does the trailer to Inception, a re-mastered Rolling Stones record and the podcast Serial all have in common?
They're all awesome. Their creators also all used iZotope products in the background to make them shine.
iZotope, started by a group of MIT undergrads in 2001, hustled their way onto the competitive music scene by first releasing a free plug-in of a record simulator. Development went into overdrive in 2013 when the company closed its first $12 million round of venture capital. Today the company is announcing another $7.5 million in financing, with $2.5 million in venture funding from ABS Capital and individuals and a $5 million debt facility from Comerica.
“We are like Photoshop but for sound,” said Mark Ethier, CEO of iZotope.
Like Adobe, iZotope won an Emmy in 2013 for its contributions to television recording. The company produces software and hardware for creating, mastering, mixing and repairing sound.
If I know anything about the truly audio-obsessed (cough cough, dad), it's that they will do nearly anything to experience a new sound. I'm not talking about the mere audiophiles. I'm talking about people for whom the Native Instruments Komplete 10 library of 12,000 sounds is not enough. For those people, iZotope offers at least a temporary escape.
A central focus of iZotope is on producing software to repair audio tracks. Let's say that you are filming the season finale of Mr.Robot and everything is perfect. White Rose is sitting next to the perfectly crackling fire, the expressions, the harp, the watch beep, it's all perfect down to the haunting delivery of the story of Emperor Nero.
Unfortunately, let's say an extra in the background drops a tray of hors d'oeuvres. In the past, the scene would have to be reshot, potentially losing out on ideal chemistry. iZotope algorithms produce a sort of spectrogram, enabling musicians to see sound like a picture. Audio engineers can simply draw around the sounds they want to process and hit the delete key to remove them.
The company has doubled since 2013 and now employs more than 100 people. The team plans to continue to expand product lines and work toward serving a broader customer base.
iZotope works with a lot of big, names but the company also sells to hobbyists and people who have home studios and produce home videos.
“The tools used to make sound effects in Star Wars are the same tools used by musicians to alter their drums,” added Ethier.
Other products in the space emphasize simplicity and one-tap mobile solutions. While iZotope cares about user experience, it also prioritizes customization, control and cutting-edge processing.
“We have a dedicated team of people researching new technology in the deep learning and machine learning realm,” noted Ethier.

The Public Religion Research Institute is out with its annual values poll. There are many fascinating nuggets, some of which we'll look at later Tuesday. For now, however, let's focus on the composition of the GOP.
Among those who identify as Republican or lean Republican, the pollsters find:
18 percent are Never Trump, neither supporting him in the 2016 GOP primary nor for 2020;
23 percent are leaning away from Trump, having supported him in the 2016 GOP primary but not for 2020;
19 percent are leaning toward Trump, not having supported him in the 2016 GOP primary but now supporting him for 2020; and
40 percent are Always Trump, supporting him both in the 2016 GOP primary and for 2020.
So nearly 20 percent have checked out of the Trump GOP and 23 percent are leaning that way, for a total of 41 percent. This, of course, does not account for the loss of many voters who won't even identify as Republican because of the Trump phenomenon.
However, the truly committed Trump voters (Always Trump) are also the “most strongly committed to the Republican Party. A majority (55%) of those who are Always Trump identifies as strong Republicans, compared to only 38% of those leaning towards Trump, 22% of those leaning away from Trump, and 22% of those in the Never Trump group.”
The party regulars are all-in with him. (“Strong Republicans express greater satisfaction and excitement about Trump's presidency than other Republicans,” the pollsters find. “More than eight in ten strong Republicans say they are satisfied (54%) or excited (30%). Far fewer weak Republicans report being satisfied (43%) or excited (14%) about the Trump presidency so far.” The Trumpification of the GOP is rather complete.
Could the Always Trump or leaning toward Trump camps reverse course if, say, the special prosecutor concludes that the president obstructed justice or colluded with the Russians? I wouldn't hold out hope for the 40 percent of the Always Trump; they've learned to ignore or rationalize away all facts, so they seem to be there for the long haul. The 19 percent, however, might be susceptible to new evidence — or a better choice for 2020.
So does this suggest the Never Trump or leaning away from Trump groups will have to leave the party to the Always Trump contingent, or is it possible to put together a majority of the non-Kool Aid drinkers (60 percent are not Always Trump)?
That, if Trump is still around in 2020, will be the big question. On one hand, the possibility that every voter who isn't Always Trump could unify behind a single alternative is slight but not nonexistent. Moreover, those who oppose Trump might well drift off into the Democratic primary, depleting the reservoir of available primary voters for a challenger.
What if instead the 41 percent of Republicans who are leaning away from Trump or are Never Trump — plus even a few re-converted voters now leaning Trump — were to break off and stand behind an independent or third-party candidate? If the Democrats went over the cliff with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), they might even lure some Democrats into their camp. It's not impossible to imagine that a break-off faction of Republicans behind a well-funded candidate with high name-I.D. could get into the top two finishers in the general election. (Then it would go to the House, which might be far more Democratic in composition than the current House.)
Well, we've got a long way to go, and the collapse of the Trump presidency, if it comes, might either shatter the party or help unify it around Vice President Pence (although his proximity to Michael Flynn, Jared Kusher and, of course, Trump might be disqualifying for lots of voters). In any case, Trump enablers may dominate the GOP, but the rest of the party may choose to cripple the Trump GOP by leaving for greener pastures. The more the GOP regulars and Trump sycophants rail against the Never Trump contingent, the more likely the latter is to leave. And if Democrats play their cards right, they might even win some of these voters over.

Trump can't keep his story straight
The Bechdel Test, originally inspired by a 1985 installment of Alison Bechdel's comic Dykes to Watch Out For, features a character with three basic requirements for a movie: it has to have at least two women in it, they have to talk to each other, and they have to discuss something besides a man. Although the rule is no guarantee of quality — or well-developed female characters — it's long been considered a useful tool for assessing how often entertainment excludes women, and whether they are portrayed as three-dimensional characters whose lives do not revolve entirely around men. In 2016, a third of the top 50 films at the box office still did not feature female characters talking to each other in any meaningful way.
While the Bechdel Test is one useful metric for looking at Hollywood's blind spots around representation, however, it doesn't touch on many important aspects of cinema — about how central those roles are, about people of color, about who's working behind the camera, as well as in front of it. With that in mind, FiveThirtyEight asked 13 people in the entertainment industry to come up with personal standards for representation in cinema. The site has presented these highly individualized rules as alternatives to the Bechdel test, and its writers examined 2016's top 50 box office performers to see how they measure up.
There's no one-size-fits-all test for cinematic feminism, so it's useful to consider a variety of metrics and individual rule sets for diversity — especially since so many of the films still failed, regardless of the requirements for inclusion. No one film passed every single test the FiveThirtyEight poll recipients suggested, but Bad Moms, starring Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell, came the closest. Some of the tests require films to meet a single criterion. Rory Uphold, writer and actress on the comedy series This Is Why We're Single, said that for her, a film passes if “the on-set crew is 50 percent women.” But although The Uphold Rule sounds simple in design, all 50 films of the examined films failed the test. The Conjuring 2 was notably one of the worst offenders, with a crew that was 90 percent male.
Lena Waite, who won an Emmy for writing the episode “Thanksgiving” on Master of None, says a film passes for her if there's a black woman in a position of power and in a healthy relationship. Only five films passed her test: Bad Moms, Hidden Figures, Independence Day: Resurgence, Boo! A Madea Halloween, and Central Intelligence.
No one film passed every single test, but Bad Moms came the closest
Ligiah Villalobos, a producer and the head writer for Go, Diego, Go, proposed her own rule for Latina representation: “The film has a Latina lead and the lead or another Latina character is shown as professional or college educated, speaks in unaccented English, and is not sexualized.” As with The Uphold Test, none of the films passed.
Other tests were concerned with how central female characters are, or whether they're well-developed. Do they exist just to get pregnant, create problems for the male protagonist, or die to make a male protagonist experience emotion? Are supporting characters mostly men? The Hagen Test, proposed by Kate Hagen, director of community at the scriptwriter group The Black List, asks a film to give half of one-scene roles to women, and have the first crowd scene be 50 percent women. Five films passed this test: Bad Moms, Finding Dory, Passengers, 10 Cloverfield Lane, and Lights Out.
It's weird and a bit sad that Bad Moms, in spite of its cheesy premise and less-than-stellar reviews, does the best job representing women of any of 2016's top 50 earners. But if a film brought to us by the bros who made The Hangover can do it, there's surely hope for the future. Tests like this will always offer an incomplete picture of a film, and the number can't necessarily tell us whether it's a compelling story. But they can help us challenge Hollywood to do more than settle for the status quo, and to question the systematic absences of many different kinds of people from the movie-making process — ones who could enrich our entertainment in countless ways, both on the screen and behind the lens.
It was mostly coincidence that drew Khaled Fahmy into the fight over the Ministry of Culture. It was early June, less than a month before a mass protest movement, and then a military coup, would force the Muslim Brotherhood and its President, Mohamed Morsi, out of power in Egypt. Over the previous week, the Brotherhood had undertaken what would be its final project of “Brotherhoodization”—the process of stacking major government posts with friendly or Brotherhood-aligned officials. This time, the target had been the Ministry of Culture and several of its constituent bodies: the opera, the ballet, the national archives and library. Ahmed Megahed, the director of Egypt's government publishing agency, found out that he'd lost his job when he read a form letter that had been left on his desk on a Sunday. Iman Ezzeldin, who runs the National Library, learned the news when she received a phone call at her home, at 11 P.M., from a secretarial assistant. “I'm sorry to tell you this,” the nervous voice on the other line said, “but you are no longer the director of the library.” The next day, there was a wax seal on the door to her office.
“I started getting all of these phone calls,” Fahmy said the other day from his home in New York, where he is teaching a course at New York University. Fahmy is a professor of history at the American University in Cairo, and in June he was conducting research at the National Archives on the historical use of Islamic law. By chance, the man that the Brotherhood chose to take over the administration of the archives and library was also named Khaled Fahmy. “Some of them were calling to congratulate me, some of them were confused and calling to ask did I really accept this job?” he recalled. “But those who understood what was going on started to phone me in alarm: ‘We have to do something about this. They appointed a Brotherhood person who will try to destroy the cultural heritage of Egypt.'”
Fahmy wasn't quite so sure, but he watched over the ensuing days as a protest movement swiftly gathered momentum, especially among the class of Egyptians generally classified as intellectuals. Several artists and novelists penned a letter to the armed forces and the public, urging them to protect the Archives from the Brotherhood's “systematic plot.” Dozens more lay siege to the Ministry of Culture, on the island of Zamalek, barring the Brotherhood-appointed minister from taking up his post. They hosted street performances of popular Egyptian ballets and operas. It was an exciting time. The new culture minister never made it into his office; after the coup, he stepped down.
The episode at the Ministry of Culture was in many ways a synopsis of a year of convoluted political struggle that led to the end of the Brotherhood's rule, and the fall of Egypt's first democratically elected government. It captured the overreach of the Muslim Brotherhood, and the clumsy, authoritarian nature of its year in power. But it also captured something else: the fear that entranced many Egyptians, who saw in the Brotherhood a threat not just to constitutional freedoms but to the very identity of Egypt. It was this fear— sometimes well-founded, sometimes bordering on hysteria—that helped drive Egyptians back into the reassuring embrace of the military, and to the familiar confines of security and bureaucracy that, in places like the National Library and Archives, had never really gone away.
The National Library of Egypt is housed in an ornate nineteenth-century building that is attached to the back of the Museum of Islamic Art, in central Cairo. When I visited the other week, Iman Ezzeldin had just returned from a week-long conference in Singapore, and seemed energized. After the coup, Ezzeldin, like most of the other administrators, had gotten her job back. But the feeling of embattlement had not quite faded.
“The Brotherhood has a grudge against culture,” said Ezzeldin, who in addition to her role at the Library is also a professor of drama at Ain Shams University. She wore a green blouse and pearl earrings that dangled from her ears like elongated teardrops. A secular Muslim, she proclaims her right to keep her hair uncovered if she wants, and have a drink every now and then should she choose to; she saw the Brotherhood as a threat to her very way of life. “The whole country was suffocating under them.”
“Some people said the Brotherhood was going to protect the archives, but ‘protection' is not in the vocabulary of the Muslim Brotherhood,” Ezzeldin said. In fact, as she saw it—in a view shared by many of her peers—the Brotherhood wanted to control the Library and Archives in order to gain access to sensitive national-security documents, and to censor or alter records and artifacts. “In the Archives, you have some very important material, if you believe the rumors, and I do,” she said. “There's information about land ownership disputed by Turkey, and the border with Sudan, and other things. They also wanted all of the archives about the Brotherhood itself.”
Ezzeldin wanted to show me some of the rare manuscripts that she had worried the Brotherhood might have sought to destroy. “Most of our manuscripts are Persian, and many have depictions of the Prophet or of women or of histories from before Islam,” she said. We passed through a set of sliding glass doors and entered a cool room where the rare manuscripts were on display in specially designed cases, with carefully controlled lighting and levels of humidity—the result of a 2007 renovation and funds from a United Nations national-heritage project.
“This is one of the ones I was most worried about,” she said, as we approached a colorful Persian astrology book. It was open to a page depicting the Zodiac goddess Virgo, dressed in a bright, purple flowing robe. “They don't believe in this, so who knows what they would do.” We moved on to some hand-drawn history books with knights riding on gold-painted horses, and a book of early fables that had been translated from Sanskrit. One told the story of a group of white rabbits who teamed up to “seek revenge on a herd of elephants who had thoughtlessly trampled upon them.” In another room, there was a giant, Mamluk-era edition of the Koran, from the fourteenth century. “I wasn't really worried about this one,” Ezzeldin said with a wink. Then she added, “Although, I didn't want them to give it away to their friends in Qatar.”
Neither Ezzeldin nor any of the other people I spoke to were able to cite any specific evidence that the Brotherhood had plans to dismantle or interfere with Egypt's historical artifacts—just vague warning signs, and a personal sense of certainty. “If you are traveling to an area that you know is full of thieves, you have to take precautions,” Ezzeldin said when I asked. “You don't have to wait until you are robbed.”
Khaled Fahmy told me that he believed that much of the fear and controversy of the time was psychological, and self-reinforcing. It was also, he adds, predicated on a misunderstanding: The Archives do not contain many of the national-security documents that the Brotherhood, and the intellectuals, believed were there; almost all of them are held in the Ministry of Interior. “I know this will sound a bit odd, but from my experience, I think the Brotherhood didn't even know that the National Library is the national library, rather than a publishing house. There is a big conflation in Egypt, even among intellectuals, about what the National Library is about, let alone the Archives. I don't think the Brotherhood really had a clear policy.”
Fahmy believes that it is the Ministry of Interior, and its various security branches, that pose the true threat to cultural institutions like archives and museums. To access documents, researchers must first apply with the facility's director, and then must submit a second application with state security. The security-application process can take weeks or months, and many people are rejected without explanation. After the revolution in 2011, none of these procedures changed at all, Fahmy and another researcher told me. The same secret-police officer, who oversaw clearances from an office inside the Archives, continued to perform his duties, from the same room.
At the height of the crisis, Fahmy went down to the Ministry of Culture sit-in. He wanted to “show solidarity,” he said. The protesters had commandeered a large conference room, and Fahmy sat in the corner with two of the more ardent activists: the recently fired Megahed, and Ibrahim Abdel Meguid, a novelist. The three men argued about the potential danger posed by calling in the military—Fahmy was wary—until one of the protesters offered Fahmy an analogy: “When you are in the middle of being mugged, held up against the wall, you have to ask the police to come and help you up.”
“I refuse this metaphor,” Fahmy replied. “If we are in a confrontation, it is with two fronts: we have the Brotherhood on one side, and the police and Army on the other.” At this, he told me, the two men “went nuts.”
“The great enemy was the Brotherhood, and Khaled Fahmy wanted us to make battle against the military forces too?” Abdel Meguid said to me in disbelief, when we met recently in a back room at Cafe Riche, a prominent intellectual hangout in downtown Cairo, around the corner from Tahrir Square. On the wall behind us was a giant portrait of the great Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz.
The previous few weeks had been a crushing test of the military's role as savior, and it wasn't looking good. Since taking over the government from the Brotherhood—and saving the Ministry of Culture in the process — the military had undertaken a massive campaign of purification. Brotherhood leaders were being rounded up for arrest, and hundreds of anti-military protesters were killed in a series of violent crackdowns. Even some secular opposition figures, popular youth leaders from the original revolution, were beginning to face prosecution for an array of vaguely worded offenses. Still, Abdel Meguid felt that the Army's takeover of the country had been worthwhile.
“I know the military forces are an enemy to the revolution, I know that,” he said. “But our experience tells us that the bigger danger lies with the Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafis.” He went on, “The revolution cannot be fought in one or two years. It happens in stages. And at every stage we acquire something. This time, we discovered the truth about the Muslim Brotherhood: that they were not Egyptian, that they had a foreign agenda, and that they were a failure.”
This was the calculation made by so many Egyptians in the final months of the Brotherhood era—at the Ministry of Culture and beyond. But not everybody is so optimistic about the outcome—or convinced that the threat posed by the Brotherhood was ever so dire.
Late in the Ministry of Culture crisis, Khaled Fahmy found himself at a public event with his namesake, the new director of the Archives. The professor delivered a stern address, aimed at the new director, about the wrong-headedness of the Brotherhood's approach to the Archives and Library. When he was done, the other Fahmy stood up without saying a word, and excused himself from the room.
“This is what the Muslim Brotherhood boils down to,” Fahmy told me. “They don't have a project—it's empty, flaky, vacuous.” The Brotherhood could have been defeated with time, Fahmy felt; calling in the military was a premature, and ultimately more reckless, choice. “I still believe that the Army takeover was the wrong thing to do,” he said. “We didn't need the Army to do this for us. We could have defeated the Brotherhood on our own.”

T-Mobile Pushes The Samsung Vibrant Launch Date To July 15
Just recently there was a rumor regarding the Samsung Vibrant claiming T-Mobile is going to move the launch date ahead from July 21 to July 15. Such a move would make T-Mobile the first American carrier to launch a Galaxy S smartphone and it would put the Samsung Vibrant on par with the Motorola Droid X in terms of launch. While it seemed like a fairly certain rumor, T-Mobile officially confirmed it today by responding to a tweet. The tweet , that can be viewed above, is short and sweet:
The Samsung Vibrant launch is scheduled for July 15. 🙂
The debate now becomes whether moving the launch date up was a good move by T-Mobile. For Android, it is a great move because of all the hype they will receive on July 15 between the Motorola Droid X and the Samsung Vibrant – two big named Android devices. Everything else, such as pricing and availability, remains the same about the Samsung Vibrant. However, I'm not sure how Radio Shack will fare in pre-orders because customers can simply order a phone on launch day and receive it much earlier than taking a pre-order. Is anyone stuck between the Motorola Droid X on Verizon and the Samsung Vibrant on T-Mobile now that they launch on the same day?
The question is simple: What's the best way to play retro games on a portable device? The answer is slightly more complicated.
Everyone has holes in their gaming history. I've never beaten a Zelda game, for instance. I know, I know. If only there were time. As it turns out, situations like airplane rides where you're stuck in one place are perfect for chipping away at one's towering pile of shame. But you can't have all your games with you all the time… CAN YOU?
Reminder: it is illegal to use ROMs that are not your own!
The 3DS offers a number of old games on Virtual Console, but that's a pretty small library in the grand scheme. There are handheld emulation devices, but they can be underpowered, limited to certain platforms, difficult to tweak, and pricey for something that may not work very well. Laptops, while flexible, are bulky, expensive, and frankly overkill for what we want to do.
So what's the solution? What provides maximum flexibility, portability, and is reasonably priced? My pick: a Windows tablet, specifically the Dell Venue 8 Pro.
The Tablet
With adoring fans, rabid critics and very few in between, why does Atlas Shrugged evoke such impassioned responses? Because it grapples with the fundamental problems of human existence — and presents radically new answers.
Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand's last novel, is a dramatization of her unique vision of existence and of man's highest potential. Twelve years in the writing, it is her masterwork.
Is the pursuit of profit a noble enterprise or the root of all evil? Is sexual passion an exalted spiritual virtue or a dirty, animalistic vice? Is reason an absolute or is faith an alternative source of truth? Is self-esteem possible or are we consigned to a life of self-doubt and guilt? In what kind of society can an individual prosper, and in what kind of society is he doomed to the opposite fate?
Rand's worldview emerges in the compelling plot turns of a mystery story, centered on the question “Who is John Galt?”
(Corrects name of aid group in para 15 to International SOS from SOS International)
By Ed Cropley
BANGKOK, May 12 (Reuters) - A furious rescue worker accused Myanmar's military junta on Monday of crimes against humanity for refusing to give visas to aid officials desperate to enter the country to help the 1.5 million survivors of Cyclone Nargis.
"They say they will call, but it's always waited, wait, wait," Pierre Fouillant of the Comite de Secours Internationaux, a French disaster rescue agency, told Reuters after being turned away from the former Burma's embassy in the Thai capital.
"I've never seen delays like this, never," said Fouillant, a veteran of 10 humanitarian disasters. "It's a crime against humanity. It should be against the law. It's like they are taking a gun and shooting their own people."
Like dozens of others, Fouillant applied on Thursday for a business visa, his only option since the military-ruled and isolated southeast Asian nation has no such thing as an "emergency aid worker" visa.
The embassy was closed on Friday for a Thai holiday, and on Saturday and Sunday. It opened as normal on Monday morning.
At least 100,000 people are thought to have died in the May 2 cyclone and storm surge in the Irrawaddy delta, a death toll that could rise dramatically if survivors do not get access to food, clean water and medicine in the next few days, experts say.
Reuters witnesses on the edges of the disaster zone say towns and villages are being swamped by huge numbers of cyclone refugees and cannot cope.
There is virtually no government assistance and food is running out. Some residents say they are afraid the desperate evacuees will be forced to turn to looting.
FRUSTRATION
Against this backdrop, small groups of rescue workers are having to wait outside the iron-spiked, grey walls of the embassy compound in Bangkok while their leaders and local visa agents try to see if their applications have got anywhere.
"It is very frustrating," said Australian firefighter Craig Allan, who dropped everything at home to get to Bangkok and apply for a visa on Thursday.
His agency, part of Baptist World Aid, is called "Rescue 24" as it is meant to be able to put a team on the ground within 24 hours of any disaster anywhere in the world. In this case, it might be 24 days, he joked bleakly.
The U.N. said its top representative in Myanmar had flown to Naypyidaw, the generals' new capital, on Monday to hand over in person a list of 60 "critical" U.N. and relief agency staff.
Despite this, U.N. officials said none of its staff in Bangkok had received any visas on Monday. They also said foreign staff inside the country were prevented from leaving Yangon.
"There are limits, if not bans, on staff going to the delta," Terje Skavdal of the U.N.'s humanitarian arm told reporters.
Patrick Michaudel, a French employee of medical services firm International SOS, with clinics in Yangon, was almost in tears as he left the embassy after a fruitless week-long visa wait.
When he got to the front of the queue, Michaudel was elated to see his passport open on the desk with a visa inside.
He could only watch in horror as a female official then carefully peeled the visa sticker out of his passport and crudely covered up the partial stamp on the passport page with liquid paper.
"No reason, no reason. She just peeled it out," he said, with a shrug of the shoulders. "I've had enough of this. I'm going home."

When the Jets paused to honor soldiers of the New Jersey Army National Guard at home games during the past four years, it was more than a heartfelt salute to the military — it was also worth a good stack of taxpayer money, records show.
The Department of Defense and the Jersey Guard paid the Jets a total of $377,000 from 2011 to 2014 for the salutes and other advertising, according to federal contracts. Overall, the Defense Department has paid 14 NFL teams $5.4 million during that time, of which $5.3 million was paid by the National Guard to 11 teams under similar contracts.
The agreement includes the Hometown Hero segment, in which the Jets feature a soldier or two on the big screen, announce their names and ask the crowd to thank them for their service. The soldiers and three friends also get seats in the Coaches Club for the game.
– From the New Jersey Star Ledger article: Jets' Salutes Honor N.J. National Guard but Cost Taxpayer
Like everything else in America, faux patriotism is also for sale.
I've written previously about how uncomfortable the superficial “honor the troops” displays at sporting events makes me feel. In the post, “Stop Thanking Me for My Service” – Former U.S. Army Ranger Blasts American Foreign Policy and The Corporate State, I noted:
I have to admit, whenever I find myself in the midst of a large public gathering (which fortunately isn't that often), and the token veteran or two is called out in front of the masses to “honor” I immediately begin to cringe as a result of a massive internal conflict. On the one hand, I recognize that the veteran(s) being honored is most likely a decent human being. Either poor or extraordinarily brainwashed, the man or woman paraded in front of the crowd is nothing more than a pawn. Even if their spouse hasn't left them; even if whatever conflict they were involved in didn't result in a permanent disability or post traumatic stress disorder, this person has been used and abused, and thirty seconds of cheering in between ravenous bites out of a footlong hotdog from a drunk and apathetic crowd isn't going to change that. I don't harbor negative sentiments toward the veteran. On the other hand, the entire spectacle makes me sick. I refuse to participate in the superficial charade for many reasons, but the primary one is that I don't want to play any part in the crowd's insatiable imbecility. It's the stupidity and ignorance of the masses that the corporate-state preys upon, and that's precisely what's on full display at these tired and phony imperialist celebrations.
Of course, it's not just me that finds these scenes hard to stomach. Many troops have come forward and expressed the exact same sentiment. For example, as Rory Fanning, who served in Afghanistan with the 2nd Army Ranger Battalion noted:
These two ceremonies seemed to catch a particular mood (reflected in so many similar, if more up-to-date versions of the same). They might have benefited from a little “awareness raising” when it came to what the American military has actually been doing these last years, not to say decades, beyond our borders. They certainly summed up much of the frustration I was feeling with the Concert for Valor. Plenty of thank yous, for sure, but no history when it came to what the thanks were being offered for in, say, Iraq or Afghanistan, no statistics on taxpayer dollars spent or where they went, or on innocent lives lost and why. Will the “Concert for Valor” mention the trillions of dollars rung up terrorizing Muslim countries for oil, the ratcheting up of the police and surveillance state in this country since 9/11, the hundreds of thousands of lives lost thanks to the wars of George W. Bush and Barack Obama? Is anyone going to dedicate a song to Chelsea Manning, or John Kiriakou, or Edward Snowden – two of them languishing in prison and one in exile — for their service to the American people? Will the Concert for Valor raise anyone's awareness when it comes to the fact that, to this day, veterans lack proper medical attention, particularly for mental health issues, or that there is a veteran suicide every 80 minutes in this country? Let's hope they find time in between drum solos, but myself, I'm not counting on it. We use the term hero in part because it makes us feel good and in part because it shuts soldiers up (which, believe me, makes the rest of us feel better). Labeled as a hero, it's also hard to think twice about putting your weapons down. Thank yous to heroes discourage dissent, which is one reason military bureaucrats feed off the term.
Very well said, and now we learn that these spectacles are often even more phony than originally suspected. NFL teams are being paid millions of dollars to host them. From the New Jersey Star Ledger:
TRENTON — When the Jets paused to honor soldiers of the New Jersey Army National Guard at home games during the past four years, it was more than a heartfelt salute to the military — it was also worth a good stack of taxpayer money, records show. The Department of Defense and the Jersey Guard paid the Jets a total of $377,000 from 2011 to 2014 for the salutes and other advertising, according to federal contracts. Overall, the Defense Department has paid 14 NFL teams $5.4 million during that time, of which $5.3 million was paid by the National Guard to 11 teams under similar contracts. The agreement includes the Hometown Hero segment, in which the Jets feature a soldier or two on the big screen, announce their names and ask the crowd to thank them for their service. The soldiers and three friends also get seats in the Coaches Club for the game. Aside from the Hometown Heroes segment, the agreements also included advertising and marketing services, including a kickoff video message from the Guard, digital advertising on stadium screens, online advertising and meeting space for a meeting or events. Flake said there was nothing wrong with the Guard using football games to recruit soldiers. The problem, he said, was spending taxpayer money on a program that, on its face, appeared to be a generous gesture by a football team.
The Daily News also covered this story, with a choice line from one of the most authoritarian members of Congress, Peter King. A man so completely insane, he makes neocons blush. He defended the spending of taxpayer money on superficial, faux patriotism:
Rep. Pete King (R-L.I.) also said “it's money well spent.” “People watching the NFL are generally inclined to be pro-military,” King told The News. “As far as the Jets, in addition to whatever money they've gotten from the (Department of Defense), I do know they are very actively engaged with veterans. The Jets do far more on balance than they get paid for.”
Football and fake patriotism. The new American Dream.

NEW DELHI: With the collegium system of judges' appointment under fire, the government proposes to end Supreme Court 's monopoly by amending Articles 124(2) and 217(1) of the Constitution to broad-base the process for selection of judges to the SC and high courts.The Centre is of the view that a law enacted to annul the judge-appointing-judge system, devised by the SC through two judgments in 1993 and 1998, will run the risk of getting struck down by the apex court.It feels that since there is an ambiguity in the constitutional provisions about the process and mechanism for appointment of judges to the SC and HCs and the present practice, it would be better to adopt the constitutional amendment route to specify the procedure for selection and appointment of judges to constitutional courts.Article 124(2) says, "Every judge of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with such of the judges of the Supreme Court and the high courts in the states as the President may deem necessary for the purpose and shall hold office until he attains the age of 65 years."It also provides that "in the case of appointment of a judge other than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of India shall always be consulted". For appointment of a high court judge, Article 217(1) mandates the President to consult the CJI, governor of the state and chief justice of the HC.These two articles provide that the executive, through the President, would have primacy in appointment of judges. This is how it was till 1993, when a constitution bench of the Supreme Court held that the Chief Justice of India would have primacy in appointment of judges.READ ALSO: Katju revelation — Row could hasten end of collegium system Five years later, through another constitution bench judgment, the Supreme Court stripped the executive of any significant say in the appointment of judges to constitutional courts by devising the CJI-headed collegium system. The scheme, which has been called judicial usurpation by others but justified by judges by invoking judicial independence, has lately been under the scanner for opaqueness. So much so that former CJI J S Verma, author of one of the judgments by which the judiciary conferred upon itself the right to appoint judges, sought a review.Efforts of the executive to do away with the collegium system began under UPA but failed to fructify. While in opposition, BJP supported the move but demanded that the Judicial Appointments Commission, which is proposed to select judges, should be fortified with a constitutional amendment in view of a likely challenge in judiciary.It reiterated its support for JAC after coming to power, and the disclosure made by retired SC judge Markandey Katju about a former CJI acquiescing into political pressure to extend the tenure of a "corrupt" judge is likely to provide fresh justification for its plans.The Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, 2013 proposes replacing the collegium with a six-member panel headed by the CJI and comprising two SC judges, the law minister and two eminent citizens as its members. The bill provides for selection of eminent citizens through another high-level committee comprising the prime minister, the CJI and the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha.A parliamentary standing committee examined the bill and recommended that the JAC panel, headed by the CJI, should be a seven-member committee instead of six as proposed. It had suggested for three eminent persons instead of two proposed in the bill, with one of them either a woman or from the minority community or from SC/ST community.
Just two years after Brave New Films released Koch Brothers Exposed, the company returns with a 2014 edition of the documentary. While the Kochs' political spending habits haven't changed much since then, they're all the more emboldened by the Supreme Court's historic McCutcheon v. FEC ruling.
With individual donors no longer facing a cap on political contributions, the dark money floodgates are entirely open. That puts a new spin on Brave New Films' hour-long examination of Charles and Dave Koch, who coincidentally happen to be tied fourth place on the Forbes 400 list.
"Koch Brothers Exposed: 2014 Edition delves even deeper into where their money is going, who their money is hurting and how much they are making during this whole process leading up to the 2014 elections," Brave New Films writes on its website.
Robert Greenwald and Brave New Films will premiere the film tonight in conjunction with a Congressional press briefing featuring U.S. House of Representatives Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. The event is set for 6:15 p.m. and can be live streamed by clicking here.
As the above trailer points out, the Koch's wealth and clout aren't the issue. It's how they use those tools. The Kochs have long supported many of the legislators who introduce and push through legislation that keeps fossil fuels alive despite their damaging effects on the environment. Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia have been seen at Koch-sponsored events. Attorney Ted Olson, who represented Citizens United in the 2010 spending decision that helped the GOP claim the House majority, is now the Kochs' legal representation.
"The Kochs use the law they helped to write to spend millions more in their efforts to buy the public policies they want," says a narrator in another trailer for the documentary.
The end of that trailer ends with Reid asking a question that should make any environmental advocate pause.
"Looks like the Koch Brothers already bought the House. They should buy the Senate," the Nevada senator said. "And what's next? They gonna buy a president?"

Zionist Union MK Shelly Yachimovich criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Saturday for taking gifts from a “sugar daddy,” after police questioned the Israeli leader for allegedly accepting expensive cigars for years from Hollywood producer and businessman Arnon Milchan, as well as more goods from a second businessman.
“The prime minister had a sugar daddy for expensive products; that is the definition of corruption,” Yachimovich, a former leader of the Labor party, said at an event in Tel Aviv, according to Israel Radio.
At a different event Saturday in Modi'in, fellow Zionist Union MK Tzipi Livni lashed out at Netanyahu as well, saying bitterly that an Israeli prime minister must decide “whether he wants to be a prime minister or an oligarch.”

Instead of concentrating on what he can give to the public, Netanyahu evidently focuses on what the public can give to him, she charged. Netanyahu “has lost the moral right to be prime minister,” Livni said.
Meretz head MK Zehava Galon joined in, asserting that the initial details of the investigation should cause serious concern for Israelis.
“Getting a monthly allowance amounting to hundreds of thousands of shekels over the years from Arnon Milchan is not a gift among friends, it's a disturbing package deal,” Galon said.
Netanyahu was questioned by police under caution on Thursday evening for five hours — the second such session in four days — as the corruption investigation against him gathered pace. Among the issues reportedly discussed was his alleged acceptance of cigars worth hundreds of thousands of shekels from Milchan, and his wife Sara's acceptance of pink champagne worth hundreds of shekels a bottle.
Police were also investigating a second case involving Netanyahu, though details surrounding the probe have not yet been released to the public. A source told Channel 2 news that this case, reportedly known as Case 2,000, would cause “a public storm” and “public anger” but would not necessarily lead to an indictment. It involved an Israeli businessman, the source said, who had sought to provide benefits to the Israeli leader in return for receiving certain perks.
Channel 10 reported a similar sentiment from investigative officials, with the broadcaster's reporters being told the case was “juicy” and publicly harmful, but was complex and not straightforward as far as the law was concerned.
Channel 10 said the businessman was a “central” Israeli figure who wanted Netanyahu to “take a certain decision,” and would reward him in turn, and that it was not clear whether Netanyahu had taken the decision.
TV reports Friday night said that more witnesses will be questioned in the next few days, and then a decision will be made on whether to question Netanyahu a third time.
Netanyahu's lawyer on Friday dismissed the seriousness of the Milchan probe. Yaakov Weinroth rejected the notion that there was anything criminal in the prime minister's actions and said he had nothing to fear from the second case either. Weinroth, who consulted with his client at the end of Thursday's questioning, said “there is nothing to the allegations” as regards Milchan's gifts. “Any reasonable person knows that there is nothing remotely criminal involved when a close friend gives his friend a gift of cigars.”
As for the second case, Weinroth said that he has heard Netanyahu's answers and “I was and I remain calm… We're not talking about money, we're not talking about loans, we're not talking about anything that constitutes a crime.” It will become clear to all, he added, that there is “no suspicion, no trace, of a criminal offense in all of this.”
Police have said a second, unnamed suspect has also been interrogated in recent days. Some reports indicated this second individual was Milchan.
Police said they could not provide further details on the second corruption case due to concerns about possible obstructions of justice. They did not elaborate. Haaretz said police investigators warned Netanyahu on Thursday not to discuss the case with other suspects, because this could constitute obstruction of justice.
Netanyahu's office made no official comment on Thursday night, but the prime minister has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. In a three-hour interview with police on Monday, Netanyahu acknowledged that he had received gifts from businessmen, but insisted they were entirely legal, Weinroth said Tuesday.
Channel 2 news reported that Netanyahu received the cigars from Milchan over the last 7-8 years. Sara received bottles of Dom Perignon pink champagne worth hundreds of shekels apiece during that period, the TV report said. It specified that the cigars included Cohiba Sigla V, Trinidad and Montecristo, and said each such cigar cost some 250 shekels (about $65).
Netanyahu is known as a connoisseur of fine cigars, and Channel 2 asserted the prime minister smokes 15,000-20,000 shekels' worth of them each month.
Some 50 people are said to have testified to date in the probe.
Sources close to Netanyahu have pointed out that Milchan — whose films include “Fight Club” and “Pretty Woman” — sits on the board of Channel 10, which the prime minister has previously tried to shutter.
Channel 10 is also partially owned by US billionaire and World Jewish Congress President Ronald Lauder, who has also been questioned by police in connection with the case. Lauder, whose family founded the Estee Lauder cosmetics giant, has long been seen as an ally of Netanyahu.
Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who is overseeing the investigation against Netanyahu, has said the prime minister is suspected of “receiving improper benefits from businessmen.” He has provided few other details.
Netanyahu has also acknowledged receiving money from French tycoon Arnaud Mimran, who was sentenced to eight years in prison in France over a scam involving the trade of carbon emissions permits and taxes on them.
The Prime Minister's Office said Netanyahu received $40,000 in contributions from Mimran in 2001, when he was not in office, as part of a fund for public activities, including appearances abroad to promote Israel.

No sooner had information come out that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was undergoing surgery in Cuba than the international media was full of speculation and rumours regarding his imminent demise.
Projecting their hopes that an illness could succeed in removing Chavez where military coups and assassination attempts had failed, the right-wing Venezuelan opposition went into overdrive.
They demanded the president step down and hand over power to the vice president.
Meanwhile, millions of Venezuelans awaited anxiously, overcome with feelings of confusion and uncertainty about the future of their president.
With Chavez absent from Venezuela for almost a month in June, the much discussed question of what would happen in Venezuela if Chavez was to go almost became more a question of “when” rather than “if”.
Some opposition columnists even joked that with Chavez out of the picture, life had become boring, with nothing much to write about.
Given his overwhelming presence in public life since first being elected in 1998, Venezuela without Chavez just did not seem like Venezuela.
Since coming to power in a landslide election on the back of a platform to do away with neoliberalism and poverty, the Chavez government has overseen a period of dramatic improvement in the lives of ordinary Venezuelans.
As part of this “Bolivarian revolution” to do away with the traditional elite-ruled political system, Chavez has constantly encouraged the people to actively involve themselves in building a new “participatory and protagonist democracy”.
This has included the creation of community and worker councils with the aim of allowing direct participation by the poor majority in the running of public affairs.
The Chavez government policies to redistribute Venezuela's oil wealth have led to dramatic drops in poverty and the extension of free health care and education to millions of people.
Finally, after much debate and conjecture, Chavez emerged on June 30 from his bed in Cuba to read out a public statement.
He spelled out the details of the operations he had undergone, first to remove a pelvic abscess and then a cancerous tumour that had until then gone undetected.
“This made a second surgery necessary which allowed us to fully remove the tumor,” said Chavez.
“It was a major surgery without complications. After that, I have continued evolving satisfactorily… towards my full recovery.
“In the meantime, I have kept up and continue to be informed and in command of the actions of the Bolivarian government, in direct contact with the vice-president, comrade Elias Jaua, and all my government staff.”
Thanking people for the many expressions of solidarity he had received, Chavez stated his conviction “that all that love, all that solidarity, are the most lofty energy which drive and will drive my willingness to vanquish in this new battle that life has put in front of me”.
“I tell you that wanting to speak to you today, as I prepare once again to return, has nothing to do with myself but with you, patriotic people, good people … I urge you to continue together, climbing up to new summits.”
In the early hours of July 4, Chavez arrived backed in Caracas.
With people spontaneously gathered in front of the presidential palace to see their leader, Chavez came out, as he has so often done, to address his supporters.
Reporting on the mood in the crowd, Venezuelan blogger Reinaldo Iturriza said he could not remember a sense of popular fervour like that which he saw that day.
“Passions overflowing. All crammed in. A truly human sea …
“The expectation. The impatience. We want to see Chavez!
“When he finally appears, it is like the man who has risen from the dead. There is much celebration, but also something akin to contained surprise.
“Some, although very few, begin to leave once he has appeared. They have seen him and that is enough.”
Others began to chant “He's back! He's back! He's back!”, as they did on April 13, 2002, when a popular uprising returned Chavez to the palace less than 48 hours after he was overthrown in a military coup
Unlike other rallies, where Chavez's words “are not listened to but rather celebrated” as if one was at a party, today the crowd was silent. “The people listen intently, they don't want to miss a word,” Isturiz said.
“Chavez's voice breaks a couple of times … the second time, the bloke in front of me breaks down, drops his head and confesses in a murmur: ‘I have never seen Chavez like this.'
“He is hurting from a pain that is not foreign, but rather fraternal. We are hurting for Chavez, the kind of hurt one feels when the love is real.
“The same people who were desperate to see him, which had clamoured for his words, for his presence, now scream, demand, order: Rest! Rest! Rest! Further back we can hear: Have a break, have a break!”
“He has only been going for half an hour, but it is enough. Chavez resists, but obeys … He obeyed in a disciplined manner the popular will.”
It was a demonstration of the dynamic relationship between Chavez and the masses that has been the motor force driving Venezuela's process of change.
This is a process that many on the left has criticised as “top-down”. But the forces of imperialism has noted this dynamic relationship is vital to break if it is to halt the revolution.
This is what lies behinds media attempts to demonise Chavez. A recent example was the effort to distort comments made by internationally renowned left-wing US academic Noam Chomsky.
The corporate media sought to turn a letter from Chomsky, that appealed to Chavez to carry out a “humanitarian gesture” to end the detention of a Venezuelan judge, into an outright attack on Chavez.
Chomsky quickly denounced the British Guardian's reporting of his comments as “extreme dishonesty”. The Guardian's report was reprinted in numerous media outlets.
The Guardian headline claimed Chomsky criticised Chavez's “assault” on democracy. Chomsky described the headline as a “complete deception”.
Among the statements that Chomsky gave the Guardian that were omitted from its article was the comment that “Venezuela has come under vicious, unremitting attack by the United States and the west generally -- in the media and even in policy”.
Also omitted was Chomsky's observation that human rights in neighbouring Colombia, a US ally, were “incomparably worse” than in Venezuela.
Chomsky also told the Guardian, in comments left out of the article: “There are steps towards a better world in Venezuela ... There have been some significant steps – the sharp poverty reduction, probably the greatest in the Americas, the [social programme] missions, and the self-governing communities look like promising initiatives.
“It's hard to judge how successful they are but if they are successful they would be seeds of a better world.”
Despite this, many, including some on the left, were quick to jump on the story as further “proof” of Chavez's undemocratic nature.
Chavez's role in the Venezuelan revolution must be placed within its historic context.
The scale of the popular explosion against neoliberalism in Venezuela during the 1990s was inversely proportional to the strength and organisation of a mass movement for change.
There was huge anger, but organised forces based on and capable of leading the angry masses were very weak.
It was in this context that Chavez emerged as a figure capable of expressing and leading the wide-spread opposition to the status quo.
Since then, Chavez's ability to read the political situation and expose the obstacles faced by the revolutionary process (including those due to internal weaknesses such as corruption and bureaucratism) has been critical to the survival and advance of the Bolivarian revolution.
At each step Chavez, has launched initiatives, such as the social missions, to encourage the self-organisation of the people to tackle their most pressing needs.
In doing so, the Venezuelan people have increasingly taken the destiny of their country into their own hands.
Chavez's absence showed that his government could continue to function without much problem. Nonetheless it is true that his role as the key figure trusted by the poor majority is, for now, irreplaceable.
The future of the process will depend on increasing the self-organisation of the masses and the building of a revolutionary party that can develop a collective leadership that can supplant Chavez's singular role.
Both these objectives face important enemies in the form of imperialism and its local allies who want to destroy the powerful symbol of defiance that Venezuela represents.
There are also those within the revolutionary movement who would prefer to maintain the status quo, and the power and privileges they have accrued, rather than deepen the process.
But for now, the Venezuelan people have demanded the creation of a new mission – Mission Rest – so that together with their president, fully recovered, they can continue to determine their own destiny.
But stark problems remain. A recent report by the Education Research Alliance confirmed that principals engage in widespread “creaming” — selecting, or counseling out, students based on their expected performance on standardized tests. In a forthcoming study, the alliance expects to show that lowest-scoring students are less likely to move to higher-performing schools.
The rhetoric of reform often fails to match the reality. For example, Paul G. Vallas, the superintendent of the Recovery School District from 2007 to 2011, boasted recently that only 7 percent of the city's students attend failing schools today, down from 62 percent before Katrina, a feat accomplished “with no displacement of children.” This was simply false.
Consider Joseph S. Clark Preparatory High School, one of the city's last traditional public schools to be “taken over.” Most of its 366 students declined to re-enroll when it reopened under new management in the fall of 2011. During its first year under FirstLine, a charter management organization, Clark had only 117 “persisters,” or returning students, according to a study by Stanford University's Center for Research on Education Outcomes, known as Credo. FirstLine could not account for where the students went after they left Clark. However, Jay Altman, its chief executive, told me in an email that before FirstLine took over, a similarly low proportion of students, about 35 percent, were returning. (The school district did not respond to my queries about Clark.)
One problem is that in the decentralized charter system, no agency is responsible for keeping track of all kids. Two years ago the Recovery School District, acknowledging that it was “worried” about high school attrition, began assigning counselors to help relocate students from schools it was closing. Louisiana's official dropout rates are unreliable, but a new report by Measure of America, a project of the Social Science Research Council, using Census Bureau survey data from 2013, found that over 26,000 people in the metropolitan area between the ages of 16 and 24 are counted as “disconnected,” because they are neither working nor in school.
Ironically, schools like Clark actually feed the New Orleans success narrative because when bad schools are taken over their “F” grades automatically convert to a “T” — for a turnaround. Thus, in the 2013-14 school year, the four schools with “T” grades wouldn't be counted as “failing” schools, nor would the 16 schools that received a “D” grade. About 40 percent of Recovery School District schools were graded “D,” “T” or “F” that year.
Adding to the difficulty of assessing the New Orleans experiment is the fact that Louisiana education data has been doled out selectively, mostly to pro-charter researchers, and much of the research has been flawed. Last fall, the Cowen Institute for Public Education Initiatives was forced to retract a study that concluded that most New Orleans schools were posting higher-than-expected graduation rates and test scores.
Last spring, Credo produced a study of 41 urban charter districts, including New Orleans, that purported to show that charters outperformed urban public schools on standardized test scores; but this study was also highly flawed. The methodology was based on comparing each charter student to a virtual “twin,” a composite of as many as seven public-school kids who attend “feeder” schools and who match the charter students on demographics and test scores. The problem in New Orleans was that there are virtually no local feeders left from which to draw comparisons.

It comes as the section just up from the north end of the bridge is becoming real-estate central
1 of 1 2 of 1
After what seems like an interminably long wait, one of Vancouver's major entry points into the downtown is fully functional today.
Mayor Gregor Robertson, engineering head honcho Jerry Dobrovolny, and heritage consultant Donald Luxton will talk to the media at the northeast end of the Burrard Bridge at 2:30 p.m. today about the "reopening" of the 85-year-old structure.
The rehabilitated bridge has restored lamp posts, concrete handrails, sidewalks, and no more concrete barriers restricting motor-vehicle traffic to one lane southbound.
It's all part of a $35-million plan approved more than two years ago.
Starting today, there are four lanes for traffic on the six-lane art deco masterpiece. The two outside lanes are reserved for cyclists.
The extensive upgrade frees up the eastern sidewalk for pedestrians, who sometimes used it anyway even when it was set aside exclusive for cyclists.
There are also new suicide-prevention barriers on the bridge.
The bridge improvements come just as the Burrard Street section north of the bridge has turned into Vancouver's next big real-estate play.
Province Health Care is developing a new hospital at False Creek Flats and downgrading St. Paul's Hospital. This will mean fewer sirens and fewer sick people in this part of town, and more appealing prospects for developers.
The Jim Pattison Group and Reliance Properties are developing Burrard Place on 27 lots around Pattison's former Toyota dealership. The $500-million mixed-used development includes 54-storey and 35-storey residential towers, as well as a 13-storey office building.
Meanwhile, Westbank has won council's approval for two buildings, including a 57-storey tower, at the First Baptist Church site across the street from the Wall Centre.
And at Davie and Burrard streets, the Esso station has been closed permanently to make way for a new real-estate development. Collier has marketed the property as "a high profile mixed-use development site".
On the south side of the bridge, Concord Pacific has bought the Molson brewery, which is on land zoned for industrial purposes.
It remains to be seen what's going to happen at that side when the beer maker moves out.
But we shouldn't be surprised if a vastly improved bridge with cycling lanes going in both directions makes its way into some of the real-estate agents' sales pitches. That's because publicly financed projects like this invariably have a way of fattening the bottom lines of savvy billionaires in the private sector.
NATHANIEL CLYNE reckons Liverpool are ready to challenge for the Premier League title this season.
The Reds' summer signing is confident they can go all the way in every competition they are in this year. Brendan Rodgers will be aiming to get back into the top four and return to the Champions League after finishing sixth last term. But former Southampton defender Clyne is ready for more than that. He said: “With the squad that we have, I would like to think that we'll look to win every competition that we're in.
GETTY AMBITIOUS: Clyne says Liverpool must challenge for the title
“With the squad that we have, I would like to think that we'll look to win every competition that we're in” Nathaniel Clyne “Our aim has to be a title challenge and trying to make the final of one of the cup competitions, while doing as well as we can in the Europa League.” Clyne, 24, arrived at Anfield this summer after the Reds agreed a £12.5m deal with Southampton. The England international is hoping he can hit the ground running at his new club as he eyes a starting spot in Roy Hodgson's national squad at next summer's European Championship. He said: “My main objective for this season is to establish myself as a Liverpool player.
“If I can do that, hopefully I can be part of the England squad at next summer's Euros. “I know that's not going to be easy as there are a lot of quality players fighting for positions in that squad at the end of the season. “But that's for down the line. First and foremost, I've got a job to do this season and I can't wait to get started.” Rodgers was keen to get Clyne in as early as possible this summer and the right-back is glad the transfer did not drag on through the summer.
In previous thread, Chinese trade surplus too reliant on US - Part 1 available at http://www.econotimes.com/Chinese-trade-surplus-too-reliant-on-US--Part-1-70096 we have shown how China's annual trade balance (goods) roared from $ 83 billion in 2000 to $343 billion in 2014 and China is too reliant on US for its growth, forex and trade surplus.
In this follow-up piece, the above chart shows the point of view from US side.
As it is quite clear from the chart as per the latest data that US trade deficit is too concentrated and most of the deficit almost 50%, actually due to China.
According to our view, US lawmakers are likely to address this issue over the coming years and would frame up policies to tackle the problem.
US will try to diversify its importing countries and geo-politics would be one of the key driver behind it. US lawmakers will work to reduce the influence of China and Russia over Globe.
Statistics -
US recorded $62.26 billion in trade deficit for May, 2015 and almost 50% of this deficit came from China. US deficit with China in fact rose by $3.1 billion to $30.6 billion.
US policymakers are likely to pursue policies to discourage such huge deficit with China going ahead.
I absolutely love pulled pork. It is the perfect way to take cheap cuts of meat and turn them into something delicious and that will keep you filled up and warm for a long time.
Here in Wisconsin, it is currently in the negative digits outside, so I thought that I would throw together some pulled pork in my crockpot. I could have bought some at the store, but that is almost always packed full of sugar which will kick you right out of ketosis and you may be stuck going through keto flu to re-adapt and no one wants that. So instead, we make it at home with only a few key ingredients.
The most important thing you will need is a crockpot or slow cooker. When eating a keto diet, I have found nothing more helpful because there are just so many recipes you can make in one, and especially in bulk, which makes eating even easier since your meals are prepared already.
Now before we get into the ingredient list, you should know that you can make this pulled pork with almost any cut of pork you would like. My favorite to use is the pork shoulder because I can get one for close to $1 a pound.
What You Will Need (12 Servings)
3 Pounds Boneless Pork Shoulder
2 tsp Onion Powder
2 tsp Garlic Powder
2 tsp Salt
1 tsp Black Pepper
1 tsp Paprika
1 tsp Ground Allspice
1 tsp Celery Salt
1 tsp Mustard Powder
1/2 cup Water
Optional BBQ Sauce
1/2 tsp ground allspice
1/4 cup yellow mustard
2 tsp hot sauce (whichever hot sauce you like)
3 Tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar
3 Tbsp Ketchup (low sugar)
4 Tbsp Sugar Substitute
1/2 tsp Xanthan gum
Buy all ingredients to get started here!
Directions
Step 1: Cut all the pork shoulder off of the bone and put it in your slow cooker.
Step 2: Take a small bowl and combine the garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, paprika, allspice, celery salt, and mustard powder. Mix it up completely.
Step 3: Rub this spice mixture all over the pork (make sure to get both sides!)
Step 4: Add the water to the pork. Cook for 6 hours on high, or 8-10 hours on low.
Step 5: Shred the pork apart with a fork. It should be falling apart by this point. Enjoy!
Step 6: If making the BBQ Sauce, remove the pork from the crockpot. Add all the Sauce ingredients and mix till smooth. Let cook on high for 10 minutes until the sauce is thickening and then add back the meat!

The age-old tradition of school kids choosing to play pickup soccer or football over their lunch hour and during recess will come to an abrupt end at an east-end school.
Citing safety concerns officials at Earl Beatty Jr. and Sr. Public School have banned the use of "hard balls" such as soccer balls, footballs, volleyballs or tennis balls.
The school issued a letter to parents Monday explaining the new regulation.
"These past few weeks, we have had a few serious incidents of parents, staff and students being hit by a hard ball or nearly being hit by a hard ball in our schoolyard," the letter reads. "Despite attempts to control the use of soccer balls, footballs, volleyballs and tennis balls, and several requests to our students to be careful and mindful of bystanders, we have not been able to ensure the safety of all students and adults."
The letter goes on to state that "hard balls" will be confiscated from students who bring them onto school property.
Softer balls, like Nerf balls or sponge balls, will still be allowed.
Alicia Fernandez, principal of Earl Beatty Jr. and Sr. Public School, told CP24 the ban is a temporary one.
She said she decided action was required when a parent was seriously injured by an errant ball on Nov. 2.
"I know students are not happy about it, but we do have to find a way to make it safe for all," she said. "This is temporary. We really want to consult with community, staff and of course students on what we can do."
Fernandez added that the relatively small size of the school playground makes safety a paramount concern.
"This is a very, very small playground compared to other schools," she said.
Could the writing have already been on the wall for webOS when former VP of worldwide developer relations Richard Kerris left HP for Nokia this week? While nothing is yet confirmed, The Guardian is now reporting that HP will indeed finally shut down its webOS division, which could affect up to 500 jobs (either through reassignment or layoffs -- we've previously heard that some layoffs had already begun ). That word comes from some unnamed internal HP sources, who reportedly expect an "imminent closure," with one employee adding that "there's a 95% chance we all get laid off between now and November." For its part, HP remained noticeably mum on any news about webOS when it announced that it would hang onto its PC business this week, and its decision to use Windows 8 on tablets certainly didn't do much to inspire the webOS faithful.
× Police: Man With Firearms Arrested On U Of A Campus
A man was arrested on the University of Arkansas campus with two firearms, according to an arrest report.
Christopher Hart, 21, was arrested by the University of Arkansas Police Department on Tuesday (April 29), at 3:49 a.m.
The officer was working a special assignment at the David W. Mullins Library when they were approached by a person who said that there was a jeep parked in Lot 7 on campus, and it had been running since 12 a.m., according to the report.
The officer met Hart, who had passed out behind the wheel with the engine running. Hart had bloodshot eyes, according to the report. The officer noted in the report that several cans of alcohol were visible in the rear floorboard.
The officer asked if Hart had been drinking, and he said no, he had just been taking a form of Adderall. Hart did have a prescription for those pills, according to the report.
After checking with a dispatcher, the officer discovered Hart had a concealed carry permit. The officer questioned him about it after seeing several small caliber bullets in the vehicle, and without saying anything, Hart reached his hand into his front left pocket. The officer stopped him, according to the report.
Hart admitted he had a loaded handgun in his front pocket. The officer had Hart get out of the vehicle and asked if he had any more firearms with him. Hart stated he had one more handgun, but it was not loaded, according to the report.
The officer found another loaded handgun in the middle console after searching, according to the report.
Hart was then placed under arrest, and he faces charges of carrying a weapon in a prohibited place and possession of a handgun on school property.
The feeling of normalcy that could be achieved by something routine like returning to work each day is impossible for many. The charter boats they worked on sank. The hotels they worked in are unable to open because they were too severely damaged. My friends are waiting for power to be restored to the shopping center where their restaurant is located so they can start selling food again and make a living.
The Caribbean is supposed to offer isolation, but not like this.
On three separate occasions, locals asked me plaintively, “Are you FEMA?” Seeing my notebook and pen, they assumed I was someone official in a position to expedite the relief they had been waiting for — a tarp for their sheared-off roof, a personal hygiene kit, an answer to a question like when trash pickup would resume.
Jeff Miller, who lives in one of the most far-removed sections of St. John, Coral Bay, described what it's like after dark. “There's no sound,” he said to me. “There's no CNN. There's no Weather Channel. There won't be for months. I have no idea who won the football game last night. I don't even know if Donald Trump is still the president.”
Then there is the sense of political powerlessness that residents feel. I always observed that Virgin Islanders resentfully saw their status as American-in-name-only. The only elected representation in Washington for these 103,000 citizens is a nonvoting delegate to Congress. They cannot vote for president. The same is true for Puerto Ricans. And as is also the case with Puerto Rico, the island is overwhelmingly nonwhite — nearly 80 percent of Virgin Islanders are black.
“They're not really on the radar,” Sally Jewell, the Interior secretary under Barack Obama, told me. When she would try to get members of Congress to take notice of local issues in the Virgin Islands, she recalled, she would be met with incredulity: “They would say, ‘We're here to focus on the United States.' And I'd say, ‘They are the United States.' ”
The Virgin Islands was relatively lucky in the sense that it suffered only a handful of deaths from the storms. But doctors I spoke with who are assisting the islands' overburdened health care system said the aftereffects are starting to show in people who are hurting themselves while cleaning out what remains of their houses or letting wounds go untreated because they cannot get to a clinic. Their driveway might still be blocked, or their car smashed.
Then there are the psychological scars a storm can leave.
I met Kirk Martin of St. John one morning on the ferry that runs people back and forth to St. Thomas. He was hoping to get to a working ATM on St. Thomas to withdraw some money. He is a contractor and said that many of the homes he worked on over the years were now in ruins. He snapped a few pictures of a boat that had washed up on the beach in the Cruz Bay section of St. John. Its hull was ripped open and its mast rested on the roof of a popular beach bar.
His eyes welled up as he told me, “Every time I go to a different part of the island I want to cry.”
Maryland's House of Delegates on Tuesday overrode Gov. Larry Hogan's veto of legislation that would push the state to get more of its energy from renewable sources.
The 88 to 51 vote split along party lines, with Democratic lawmakers providing more than enough votes for the three-fifths majority needed to override the Republican governor's veto.
The vote was not unexpected, as the bill had passed both chambers by large majorities last year. It would require that renewable sources such as wind and solar provide 25 percent of the state's energy by 2020, an increase over the current goal of 20 percent by 2022. The “Clean Energy Jobs Act of 2016,” as it was titled, also specifies that 2.5 percent of the state's power must come from solar, up from 2 percent in current law.
"With the House override, Maryland's legislature has voted for progress,” said Del. Bill Frick, the majority leader and top sponsor of the House bill. The Montgomery County lawmaker said the vote was a stand for “cleaner air, for good jobs, and for leadership in an emerging industry,” and a rejection of what he called “disingenuous and inaccurate posturing of Hogan's politically motivated veto message.”
When he vetoed the bill, Hogan had said that while its goal was laudable, he considered it the wrong approach to increasing renewable energy. Under the current renewable energy law, he said, Maryland ratepayers paid $104 million in higher utility bills in 2014 because renewable energy cost more than power from fossil fuels. If the new bill became law, he predicted, ratepayers would be forced to pay $49 million to $196 million more by 2020.
In Tuesday's debate, Republican delegates backed the governor, likening the bill to a de facto tax increase that they contended would be a burden to many households and businesses.
Fiscal analysts with the General Assembly's Department of Legislative Services projected that meeting the bills' higher renewable energy goals could increase the average residential customer's monthly bill by anywhere from 77 cents to $3.06 in 2020, depending on a variety of factors.
Supporters, though, contended the measure would spur net economic growth of up to $600 million per year because of new solar construction and of Marylanders' improved health from breathing cleaner air. They said the bill would create incentives for development of roughly 1,300 megawatts of new clean energy in the state, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by more than 2.7 million metric tons per year and supporting more than 1,000 jobs annually in the growing renewable energy industry.
Environmentalists hailed the House's action and called on the Senate to follow suit. That chamber had delayed a vote last week and is scheduled to take it up on Thursday.
“This is one of the first state legislative votes nationwide to show that states WILL fight back when leaders like Hogan and the climate deniers in Washington attempt to thwart progress on clean-energy jobs and global warming pollution,'' said Mike Tidwell, director of Chesapeake Climate Action Network.
Clive Allen
Rangers 2 Arsenal 0
Ibrox, Scotland
Clive Allen made his debut on 1 August 1980, only played in 3 friendlies in the space of a week but was big back page news!
Purchased in June from QPR for £1.25million at the age of 19, which was the first seven-figure transfer involving a teenager, he was then shortly afterwards swapped with Kenny Sansom in a deal with Crystal Palace without playing a competitive game for the Gunners.
This was Arsenal's first game since the awful end to the previous season when they had fought so hard but ended with nothing to show for their efforts, and had also lost their talisman Liam Brady to Juventus.
Rangers dominated the game from start to finish with their own starlet John MacDonald outshining Allen, as MacDonald scored twice in this 2-0 stroll. The first came in 30 minutes and the second in 65 minutes.
Allen hardly got a kick in the 90 minutes, and goalkeeper Pat Jennings chose this game to make a string of mistakes and was at fault for both goals. For the first he was positioned poorly and for the second he dropped a backpass at the feet of MacDonald who could not miss with an open goal.
We were asked by Andy Exley to write in last season's Emirates Cup programme about 10 big Gunners who made their first team debut for the club during the pre-season. This was a tie in with Petr Cech who made his debut a week before the Emirates mini tournament at the 2015 Barclays Asia Trophy final

The House passed a bill Friday that requires the federal government to notify consumers within two days if their personal data has been breached on online-based insurance markets tied to the new health care law.
Roughly one third of voting Democrats joined the Republican majority in passing the Health Exchange Security and Transparency Act, 291 votes to 122, even though the Obama administration said legislation is unnecessary because notification rules are in place.
Republicans said the measure is common sense.
“All it says is the administration has to let victims of identity theft or information theft to be notified. That's it,” House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Virginia Republican, said.
The Democrat-run Senate is unlikely to take up the bill after it ignored dozens of other GOP-led measures that attempted to dismantle or change the Affordable Care Act, even though 67 House Democrats voted for the legislation.
No Republicans voted against the measure, and the office of the House majority whip said it was the highest Democratic vote tally so far on any Obamacare-related bill sponsored by the law's opponents.
The vote marked the GOP's first legislative strike against Obamacare in the new year. House leaders plan to hold a vote next week on a bill that would require the Obama administration to publish enrollment data each week — and not monthly as it does now — in a sign that GOP leaders are shifting their anti-Obamacare agenda toward stricter oversight of the law in place of votes to repeal it.
Republican leaders said the administration cannot be trusted to secure Obamacare's Web system after the disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov, the federal portal set up to connect residents of 36 states with health coverage. They also cited an administration official's concerns that the system had not been fully tested prior to its Oct. 1 launch.
Americans are particularly sensitive to data breaches in an increasingly cyber-based world, they added, citing the millions of Target stores customers who had to monitor their bank accounts after their credit card numbers were swept up by hackers.
“What if Target had not bothered to tell anyone? … The damage would certainly be worse,” said Rep. Joe Pitts, Pennsylvania Republican and the bill's sponsor.
The White House said Thursday it opposes the bill, because it imposes “unrealistic” and “costly” burdens on the administration. However, it did not issue an explicit veto threat against the measure.
The federal government has information-technology standards in place that require it to notify people as quickly as possible if their personally-identifiable information has been compromised, according to the administration's Office of Management and Budget.
Democrats said it would be difficult for the Department of Health and Human Services to notify consumers of breaches on the 15 health exchanges run by the states without the federal government's help.
Plus, they said, no one has been able to hack HealthCare.gov, so Republicans appear to be using the bill to scare people away from Mr. Obama's law.
“They're addressing a reality that's not there,” said Rep. Frank Pallone, New Jersey Democrat.
Democrats said the GOP majority needs to focus on pressing issues of the day, rather than shut things down.
“Heck, they're even shutting down bridges in New Jersey,” Rep. Joe Crowley, New York Democrat, said, a dig at revelations that staff members for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, closed lanes to the George Washington Bridge in an act of political retaliation.

A local coffee shop has closed its doors, this time possibly for good.
A local coffee shop has closed its doors, this time possibly for good.
Lorry's Coffee moved to its new location on West Street in 2014, but the coffee shop has now closed for business.
The business, co-owned by Lorry Ver Steeg and Matthew Goodman, first opened in October 2011 and was formerly located across from Lake Laverne at 2320 Lincoln Way. The shop was forced to relocate in March 2014 when the building was purchased for the Campustown redevelopment by the Providence, R.I.-based Gilbane Development company, along with the former First National Bank property.
Shortly after, the shop re-opened in the same building as Mother's Pub, located at 2900 West Street. Goodman said the "transition location was a challenge for the business."
Goodman said there is currently no set plan for the future of the coffee shop, and any new building or potential coffee truck "is a long way away."
Have politicians always sold dreams knowing they couldn't be achieved? In a system with institutions meant to temper the political whims of its constituents, progress is gradual and arduous. So why do politicians promise they can do the impossible, like, I don't know, drafting a bill that would lower taxes and healthcare costs while improving coverage in a matter of weeks for example? Wouldn't this hurt them and their credibility in the long-run? Not if they didn't win.
I don't think the GOP thought Trump was going to win. I don't think Trump thought he was going to win. I'm not even sure Trump wanted to win. So they did what they have for the last eight years — claim they could govern better than Democrats, in totally implausible ways, if we just gave them a chance!
Trump promised his followers the world: lower taxes, lower healthcare costs, a revival of their dying industrial jobs, a swift and decisive victory over ISIS (and refugees?), a border wall with the bill footed by Mexico, a drained swamp, etc. But he never thought he'd have to follow through. Just the way the GOP never thought they'd really have to follow through and draft a replacement healthcare bill.
This irresponsible behavior is reminiscent of an overzealous kid running for student government, unfamiliar with the bureaucracy of school administrations, promising “longer recess!” or “pizza everyday!” It's a baseless attempt to attract as many voters as possible, but if you think you're going to lose anyway, it's easy to get carried away with these promises without risking much.
But Trump is the dog that caught the car, and now his followers are looking to him to make several sweeping and immediate changes, because he said he could. This is simply not how policy works. To be fair, Trump is most likely not very familiar with our institutional processes, so maybe he didn't realize he was making promises he couldn't keep. But it's not going so well, is it?
Author of “The Art of the Deal”, Donald J. Trump couldn't unite his own party behind their long-awaited and overly touted healthcare rebuttal. This genius, smooth-talking businessman has pissed off multiple close allies in the first two months of his presidency. Despite being an outsider, he's not above the political process; he's in the thick of it and way over his head.
It's been a tough few months for our president, I'm sure, realizing he couldn't follow through on his absurd promises or blatantly lie without being scrupulously fact-checked. His ego must have taken a hit when his press secretary had to tell a room of journalists not to take him too literally, but how else can they recover from a campaign built on lies and fantasy?
The lesson to be learned from this nationwide ordeal is that we like politicians who level with us. Trump's persona as a man of the people garnered a fervent base, because they felt like he spoke to them on their level. Going forward, another way to appeal to voters as a relatable candidate, other than speaking like a middle schooler, is being honest about the obstacles that policies face in American institutions.
I want to be clear and say that Republicans are undeniably not the only politicians that build and abandon platforms around the hopes of the vulnerable. But perhaps the exposure of the blatant lies of this particular President and party, as well as their spectacular failure, will teach us to be more cautious about taking the words of any politician at face value.
The memorandum was signed on Thursday in the framework of the Eurasian Economic Forum in China's north-western city of Xian by Cambodia's Foreign Minister and SCO Secretary General.
Cambodia has officially become a dialogue partner in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). The memorandum was signed on Thursday in the framework of the Eurasian Economic Forum in China's north-western city of Xian by Cambodia's Foreign Minister Hor Namhong and SCO Secretary General Dmitry Mezentsev.
"Cambodia will actively participate in the work of SCO and cooperate with the organization," Hor Namhong said. The country hopes to become an observer in SCO in the future and later join the organization as a full-fledged member, he added.
The political decision to grant Cambodia the status of dialogue partner in SCO was made during a summit in Ufa in July 2015.
The Shanghai Cooperation Organization is a permanent regional international association, whose establishment was announced on June 15, 2001, in Shanghai. During the SCO summit in Ufa on July 9 and July 10 the beginning of the admission procedure for India and Pakistan was announced. The leaders of the SCO member-countries also decided to grant Belarus observer status, while Azerbaijan, Armenia, Cambodia and Nepal became dialogue partners.

Obey is the latest to head from the Capitol Hill to K Street. David Obey heading to K Street
Former House Appropriations Chairman David Obey is walking the well-worn path between Capitol Hill and K Street, POLITICO has learned.
Obey will join former House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt's lobbying shop on Monday, bringing a master of the federal funding process on board at a time of renewed economic austerity on Capitol Hill.
Story Continued Below
The Wisconsin Democrat, who served for more than four decades in the House, sat at the helm of the committee that decides where and how taxpayer money would be spent, giving him unique insights into how to win federal money for clients, especially in an age of earmark bans and spending cuts. He'll also work on health, education, energy, transportation, trade and defense issues.
“Obey was a great legislator in the truest sense of the word. There isn't an issue that hasn't crossed his path nor is there an economic sector that he hasn't had to work with,” Tom O'Donnell, managing partner of Gephardt Government Affairs, said in an email to POLITICO. “And over time, he's worked with different political configurations in the House, Senate and the White House. We are very fortunate to have him on board.”
In a statement to POLITICO, Gephardt said, “I could not be more thrilled to welcome Dave to the firm. He's been a longtime friend and, as former chairman of the Appropriations Committee, no one knows the federal government's funding process better than he does. I've long admired his ability to negotiate, problem-solve and develop legislative strategy: he will be an incredible asset to our team.”
Former lawmakers who understand the appropriations process are highly valued, especially someone as wired and influential as Obey. Insiders understand that money that used to be tagged for earmarks isn't going away; it's just moving. Instead of lawmakers designating it for hometown projects, government agencies and departments will dole it out through contracts and grants.
Other former appropriators have been in demand on K Street recently.
Arent Fox hired former Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) and Bob Bennett (R-Utah) just days after they left Congress and Thompson Coburn hired newly retired Sen. Kit Bond (R-Mo.). Both Bond and Dorgan have said they don't plan to lobby once the two-year ban expires.
It's unclear if Obey will lobby after the cooling-off period expires. He was unavailable for comment Friday.
Scott Amey of the government watchdog group the Project On Government Oversight has said “former appropriators are huge gets for lobbying firms.”
“They have the knowledge necessary to maneuver clients through the Senate as well as the appropriate federal agencies,” he said earlier this year. “They can easily provide a boost to clients looking for federal funds.”

Washington (CNN) – Half of young Christians have bucked the opinion of their older brethren and said they favor legalizing marijuana for recreational use, according to a recent poll.
Thirty-two percent of Christian's aged 18-29 said they “strongly favor” legalization, while 18% said they “favor” the move, according to a Public Religion Research Institute survey released Thursday. Among Christian's 65 and older, only 9% said they strongly favor legalization and 47% say they strongly oppose it.
Though the younger generations favor legalization, all Christians still lean toward keeping the drug illegal. While 39% of Christians say they favor or strongly favor legalization, 54% say they support keeping the drug illegal, according to the poll.
According to the poll, 45% of young Christians have “tried marijuana,” compared to 13% of Christian seniors who say they have.
“Nearly two-thirds (65%) of Americans who report they have ever tried marijuana support legalizing marijuana,” the report says. “While an identical number (65%) of Americans who report that they have not tried marijuana oppose its legalization.”
“Marijuana legalization connects to a broader generational story that we are seeing in religious culture,” said Robert P. Jones, CEO of the polling firm. “The younger, religious Americans are taking a lot of their cues from their generational cohorts. To be sure, they are colored by their religious affiliation.”
Jones continued: “The generational sea change on this issue is also shifting the ground inside churches.”
Marijuana, while a longtime political question, was thrust to the forefront of debate in 2012, when two states – Washington and Colorado – legalized use of the drug for recreational use. That same year, Oregon voted to keep marijuana illegal.
In Washington, legalization was a way to raise tax revenue. The Washington referendum called for a 25% tax rate imposed on the product three times: when the grower sells it to the processor, when the processor sells it to the retailer, and when the retailer sells it to the customer.
Marijuana use, according to the poll, is not seen as a sin by a majority of Americans.
Seventy percent of Americans said that recreational use of marijuana is not a sin, compared to 23% who said they believe using the drug is sinning. While most religious groups follow this trend, according to the poll, white evangelical Protestants are the most divided group, with 40% indicating using marijuana is a sin and 48% saying it is not.
These results have led poll organizers to believe marijuana use will continue to gain more acceptance in the coming years.
“Much like same-sex marriage, what we are seeing here is generational replacement,” Jones said. “As more young Christians come to adulthood, they bring with them different experience and views.”
After electoral victories in November, the good news for those in favor of marijuana legalization keeps on coming. In early April, the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press released a poll that found 52% of Americans favored legalization, compared to 45% who favored keeping marijuana illegal.
This was the first time in the history of the Pew poll that legalization has been in the majority.
The PRRI poll results are based on telephone conversations with a random sample of 1,000 adults. The conversations took place between April 17 and April 21.

Trump this week tweeted attacks on the federal judges that ruled against his travel ban, and has frequently targeted the New York Times and CNN.
Earlier Saturday, Trump again hit courts in defense of his travel ban.
“Our legal system is broken! "77% of refugees allowed into U.S. since travel reprieve hail from seven suspect countries." (WT) SO DANGEROUS!” he tweeted, quoting a Washington Times article published Thursday.
It was from a rental car company in Edmonton where I rented a vehicle on the Sharks last road trip to the Alberta capital. It seems that I was caught speeding, by a traffic camera. As you can see, the notice doesn't indicate how fast I was traveling.I don't dispute that I was probably over the limit. As I recall "the great" Drew Remenda was in the car with me and we were almost certainly distracted breaking down the Sharks power play breakout. But when I took a closer look at the ticket, I was floored.I was speeding on Wayne Gretzky Drive and my ticket was for 99 dollars. Either that's a planned thing so people don't feel so bad about paying the fine or its one of the greatest coincidences ever! Either way, for the first time in my life, I'm framing my speeding ticket.

Story highlights Trump's support in the Republican Party has eroded in the past few days
Earlier Monday, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said he would no longer defend Trump
Washington (CNN) Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus reiterated his support Monday for embattled Republican nominee Donald Trump -- telling members of the RNC that the operation stands fully behind his campaign.
"Nothing has changed in regard with our relationship," Priebus said in a call with RNC committee members, according to sources on the call. "We are in full coordination with the Trump campaign. We have a great relationship with them. And we are going to continue to work together to make sure he wins in November."
The move to present a united front with the Trump campaign comes after earlier Monday, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan told Republican members of the House he would no longer defend Trump, but did not formally rescind his endorsement.
Priebus convened the call with members on short notice over the weekend, and did not take any questions. His remarks lasted less than 14 minutes.
Trump's support in the Republican Party has eroded in the past few days after a 2005 recording surfaced of him making lewd and sexually aggressive comments toward women. Several prominent members of the party have pulled support for Trump, and the vast majority have publicly condemned his comments.

Like America's Founders, I like constitutional constraints on government and dislike untrammeled majoritarianism.
So my gut instinct is to reject Swiss-style direct democracy as a governing system.
Yet I have to give credit to the Swiss people for being very sensible when asked to vote in national referendums. Here are some recent results.
In 2010, nearly 60 percent of the electorate rejected a class-warfare income tax proposal.
In 2014, Swiss voters overwhelmingly killed a minimum-wage mandate.
Also in 2014, the voters of Switzerland rejected single-payer healthcare by a landslide margin.
And in 2015, more than 70 percent of voters rejected a federal death tax.
And don't forget they voted by a landslide margin in favor of a spending cap back in 2001.
Now they've done it again.
Voters were asked today to decide whether every adult should automatically receive more than $2,500 per month as part of a guaranteed basic income.
Sounds like a nice free lunch, right? That offer might be very attractive in a place like France, but Swiss voters apparently understand that government can't give all that money to people without first taking that amount of money from people. They rejected Bernie-nomics by an overwhelming margin.
In Switzerland, there don't appear to be left-wing blue states and right-wing red states. Instead, the entire nation favors limited government. Even the French-speaking parts of the country voted against the scheme.
I'd like to take credit for these results. I was in Switzerland early last month to discuss and debate this plan. Here's what I said (click here to watch the entire panel discussion).
In reality, I'm sure my remarks didn't have any impact on the outcome. Nonetheless, it's nice to be on the winning side.
Though you may have noticed that I said some nice things about a guaranteed basic income in my presentation. That's because, as I wrote back in 2013, these plans also would get rid of the current dysfunctional welfare state.
Writing in the Wall Street Journal a couple of days ago, Charles Murray of the American Enterprise Institute makes the best possible case for an automatic government-provided income.
The UBI has brought together odd bedfellows. Its advocates on the left see it as a move toward social justice; its libertarian supporters (like Friedman) see it as the least damaging way for the government to transfer wealth from some citizens to others. Either way, the UBI is an idea whose time has finally come… First, my big caveat: A UBI will do the good things I claim only if it replaces all other transfer payments and the bureaucracies that oversee them. If the guaranteed income is an add-on to the existing system, it will be as destructive as its critics fear.
Here are the highlights of Murray's plan.
…the system has to be designed with certain key features. In my version, every American citizen age 21 and older would get a $13,000 annual grant deposited electronically into a bank account in monthly installments. …The UBI is to be financed by getting rid of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, housing subsidies, welfare for single women and every other kind of welfare and social-services program, as well as agricultural subsidies and corporate welfare. As of 2014, the annual cost of a UBI would have been about $200 billion cheaper than the current system. By 2020, it would be nearly a trillion dollars cheaper. …Under my UBI plan, the entire bureaucratic apparatus of government social workers would disappear.
And while he acknowledges that some people will stop working and live off their handouts, he makes a reasonably persuasive argument that some people will be encouraged to enter the labor force.
Under the current system, taking a job makes you ineligible for many welfare benefits or makes them subject to extremely high marginal tax rates. Under my version of the UBI, taking a job is pure profit with no downside until you reach $30,000—at which point you're bringing home way too much ($40,000 net) to be deterred from work by the imposition of a surtax. Some people who would otherwise work will surely drop out of the labor force under the UBI, but others who are now on welfare or disability will enter the labor force.
Sounds good, but then consider all the leftists who support a basic income scheme and imagine how such a system would work if they were in charge.
That's what worries me. If Charles Murray was a economic czar and there was never a risk of his plan being modified, I'd be sorely tempted to say yes.
But that's not a plausible scenario. In the real world, a guaranteed basic income might start small and the current welfare state might be curtailed as part of the original deal, but I would be very worried about subsequent reforms that would expand the size of the handout (much as the EITC has been expanded in America) and reinstate misguided redistribution programs.
Perhaps this is why, in a column for the Financial Times, John Kay is not very sanguine about the numbers.
Bernie Sanders, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, has expressed sympathy for basic income while stopping short of endorsement. Yanis Varoufakis, the former finance minister of Greece, is a proponent. …Yet simple arithmetic shows why these schemes cannot work. Decide what proportion of average income per head would be appropriate for basic income. Thirty per cent seems mean; perhaps 50 per cent is more reasonable? The figure you write down is the share of national income that would be absorbed by public expenditure on basic income. The Swiss government reckoned spending on social welfare would approximately double. To see the average tax rate implied, add the share of national income taken by other public sector activities — education, health, defence and transport. Either the basic income is impossibly low, or the expenditure on it is impossibly high.
Exactly.
P.S. On a separate topic, the death of Mohamed Ali, the larger-than-life superstar boxer, has generated a lot of reminiscing.
Well, courtesy of Mike Flynn, here's my favorite Ali historical flashback.
P.P.S. Speaking of athletic superstars (at least in our fantasies), the Beltway Bandits finally prevailed in a 2016 softball tournament. Here's our team photo after winning the Crabtown Classic.
P.P.S. Returning to the main topic of today's column, here's an amusing cartoon strip on the notion of a basic income.
It's from the same person who put together the “magic boats” cartoon strip about the minimum wage.
New Delhi, Aug 31: Jasleen Kaur, who hogged the limelight after her alleged eve-teasing incident in Delhi, seems to fall in her own trap. Days after story sent the social media on fire, the truth as it turns out now is just the opposite. Jasleen Kaur portrayed herself as the victim and world sided with her. However, the new pictures, videos and eye-witnesses statement busted Jasleen Kaur's claims that she was humiliated and abused by a man. The accused Sarvjeet Singh has a different narrative about the incident. (ALSO READ: Delhi Eve teasing case: Eyewitness claims Jasleen Kaur, AAP supporter lied to frame Sarvjeet Singh!)
We bring to you the three versions of the story:
Jasleen Kaur's story:
Jasleen Kaur shared a picture of Sarvjeet Singh on her Facebook account alleging that he made obscene comments at her. The picture went viral and Jasleen turned a ‘braveheart' who took on molester.
Sarvjeet Kaur's story:
Sarvjeet Singh claimed that Jasleen pulled up a publicity stunt by playing the victim card and also used her political influence to frame him. “She (Jasleen) is an AAP supporter and doing it for political mileage, just wants to be famous,” said Sarvjeet.
Witness' story:
After the incident came to light, a witness named Vishwajeet Singh came forward and denied all the charges framed by Jasleen Kaur. Vishwajeet in his narrative of the incident said that it was Jasleen who used abusive remarks and made obscene actions at Sarvjeet.
Here are some proof against Jalseen Kaur:
Jasleen told in her statement said that she was going from the spot where the incident took place, while according to Sarvjeet she was controlling the traffic. Below is the picture showing Jasleen while controlling the traffic on the road.
The witness Vishwajeet also said that Jasleen was controlling the traffic. A twitterati also shared a screenshot of a WhatsApp group that says that Jasleen was going to take part in the traffic management on the street where the incident took place.
The above two pictures prove that Jasleen lied! It will be wrong to judge either Jasleen or Sarvjeet. We leave that up-to you to decide who is right and who is wrong.

Six years ago, Georgia promised sweeping changes to its psychiatric-care system, a dark, dangerous place where dozens of patients died under suspicious circumstances.
On Wednesday, state officials acknowledged their efforts have fallen short. They agreed to at least two more years of federal oversight, pledging new spending if necessary to find appropriate, safe homes for patients institutionalized in state mental hospitals, some of them for decades.
Gov. Nathan Deal signed documents committing to remove developmentally disabled adults from the state hospitals by June 30, 2018, three years later than a deadline set in 2010.
As of January, 266 people with developmental disabilities remained in the hospitals.
In addition, the state said it would increase its monitoring of people it already transferred to group homes and other community settings – where more than six dozen former hospital patients died during the past six years. Officials also will conduct thorough investigations when residents of those facilities die.
The new promises came five days before the U.S. Justice Department was scheduled to present evidence in court that Georgia had failed to deliver on its promises in a 2010 agreement that settled a lengthy federal investigation. Justice Department lawyers were prepared to ask U.S. District Judge Charles Pannell to hold state officials in contempt of court. Now, they are joining with the state in asking Pannell to approve a new agreement.
The state's lawyers had complained earlier this year that federal authorities were trying to make Georgia meet conditions not contained in the 2010 agreement. For example, they argued in court documents that the original agreement didn't define how good facilities had to be before former hospital patients were placed in them.
In a statement Wednesday, however, Deal described the new agreement as “a significant accomplishment for the state of Georgia.”
“Over the last six years,” Deal said, “Georgia has invested tremendous resources in improving services for people with behavioral health and intellectual and developmental disability needs. I am proud of the work we are doing, and I look forward to our continued progress in this area.”
Deal inherited the challenge of overhauling the state's mental health system from Gov. Sonny Perdue, who signed the original settlement agreement in 2010. Under the new agreement, the state will remain under federal supervision for most of the time left in Deal's term, but it could reclaim control of the mental health system by the time a new governor takes office in January 2019.
The Justice Department opened its investigation in 2007 following articles in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution documenting more than 100 suspicious, preventable deaths during the previous five years. The newspaper revealed substandard medical care, neglect and abuse of patients, and a lack of oversight that contributed to dozens of deaths and injuries.
Advocates for people with disabilities praised the new agreement, saying it indicates the state will try much harder to ensure quality care for patients transferred into community facilities.
“It's a really serious commitment from the state to make sure the community system can support all people with developmental disabilities,” said Alison Barkoff, the director of advocacy at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law in Washington. She represents advocacy groups that pushed for strict enforcement of the 2010 agreement.
The state's new efforts will specifically focus on former hospital patients with particularly complex medical issues, such as those who rely on feeding tubes or who cannot eat solid food without choking. Many facilities don't have the ability to care for such patients.
Of the first 503 people transferred out of state hospitals, 79 died within a few months, according to reports by a court-appointed monitor.
The state Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities suspended the transfers at least twice, citing a lack of suitable facilities.
Advocates hope the new agreement will finally bring the matter to an end.
“We think this is a very strong agreement,” Barkoff said. “It lays out a very good road map.”
Parker* is a 21-year old man who grew up in Utah in the Church of Latter Day Saints, and after having some medical issues that required treatment in California, he found that medical cannabis was a useful tool for managing his symptoms. Now Parker's back in Utah and has to medicate in secret due to the stigma associated with cannabis use, which he feels is especially taboo due to his Mormon upbringing.
He started dating a young woman and hasn't “come out” to her about his cannabis consumption. He asked me, “How do you bring up cannabis in a relationship where they might have a very different, if not extreme, point of view? Furthermore, how do you bring up stuff like this with close friends without accidentally destroying the pre-built relationship?”
These questions are complicated and multi-faceted. I reached out to a few people, including a writer, a budtender, and a friend who grew up in a conservative family, for their insight. First, you might want to check out Leafly's suggestions on how to disclose your cannabis consumption to a family member, as many of the strategies are applicable in this scenario.
Shape Your Approach
The second step comes from H.D. Roslin, writer and communication ninja. She suggests beginning with a personal inventory by asking yourself the following:
What motivates the desire to share this aspect of your life with this person? In what ways do you envision it serving you?
If they respond in ways that are not charitable, are you prepared for that and have supports in place?
Could their rejection harm you in any way?
After answering Roslin's questions for yourself, you may find that cannabis is not actually a subject you want to broach with this person, which is an entirely valid choice.
Listen to Your Partner
If the answers to these questions positively reinforce your decision to broach the subject, Roslin advises, “[The listening phase] is crucial. What do you need or want from them? Open with that, explicitly. Be prepared for either response (positive or negative), and accept their response as certain the first time–in other words, don't keep revisiting the subject on multiple occasions hoping they'll change their mind. Allow them to express their needs and preferences regarding your private use if they have any (e.g., “Please don't come to dates with me high,” or “Don't bring substances into our sex life”). Honor those preferences, or if you are unwilling to do so, terminate the relationship or your cannabis use.”
For more on creating relationship agreements with a non-cannabis using partner, check out my article on navigating discordant cannabis use in intimate relationships.
Honesty is the Best Policy
I also spoke with Andrew Mieure from Top Shelf Budtending, who suggests being as honest as possible. “Make sure to tell them that you are medicating and that it isn't just to be ‘high.' Talk about your accomplishments and how cannabis has helped you achieve them. Perhaps show data supporting cannabis use as a positive thing, share a story, or put them in contact with other patients who can explain it better than you could. Sometimes a support network can go a long way.”
Mieure brings up a great point here–social proof is a powerful convincer, so being able to cite studies, articles about public figures, or even just a mutual friend who is a cannabis consumer can go a long way toward normalizing it. You could even use some of the tenants of Christianity (or the applicable religion) to support your position. Mieure shared his insights gleaned from coming out to his Christian family members, noting, “Having a Christian upbringing, you could argue the fact of ‘every seed' being used for humanity from the Book of Genesis. Once I was able to get that off of my chest and stopped hiding it, it started to become normal, even around them.”
Don't Be Afraid to Be Picky
The final option, and the one I choose to employ in my own dating life, is to select partners based at least in part on their willingness to accept the part that cannabis plays in my life. I have a “potential dealbreakers” conversation on my first date with a prospective partner. Some may suggest waiting longer, but the first date has always worked best for me. Getting things out on the table up front saves time and reduces the chances that Person A starts to develop feelings, only to find out that the Person B has made lifestyle choices that the Person A cannot abide.
Have you ever come out to a partner about your cannabis use? How did you approach the conversation?

“Where man is not, nature is barren”
- William Blake, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell
One of the first things that amazed me about the Amazon—and just always continues to enthrall—is the sheer abundance of super delicious and highly nutritious foods here. In fact, in the rainforest metropolis of Iquitos, Peru where I currently live, superfoods including the highest natural sources of vitamins C, E and A in the world are sold on every street corner for dirt cheap—check out the photo guide to them I wrote for Paste's Health section a couple months back.
But while most people know that the Amazon Rainforest is the most biodiverse place on the planet and that is a natural pharmacy beyond compare, it still conjures up the textbook image of a savage wilderness for most, the opposite of “civilization.” Nothing could be farther from the truth.
“Some of the tree species that are abundant in Amazonian forests today, like cacao, açaí and Brazil nut, are probably common because they were planted by people who lived there long before the arrival of European colonists,” says Nigel Pitman, the Mellon Senior Conservation Ecologist at Chicago's Field Museum, in a brand-new, first-of-its-kind, Amazon-wide study on how the rainforest's edible biodiversity was shaped by human hands just published at Science Daily.
Cacao is chocolate, ya know, and acai is deli as hell too, meaning that the ancient Amazonians created a chocolate and berry superfood forest that would have made even Willy Wonka jealous.
For those of us who love the Amazon and have been paying attention, however, this is a just the latest news in a slowly breaking discovery that the largest tropical forest in the world is really a garden designed for maximum food production. The first time I read about it was a decade or so ago in Charles Mann's NYT bestseller 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus.
“Planting their orchards, the first Amazonians transformed large swaths of the river basin into something more pleasing to human beings,” writes Mann in a feature for The Atlantic back in 2002 that is well worth the read.
Since then, more and research has surfaced showing that not only was the Amazon intensely cultivated but that the inhabitants, far from being the pristine hunter-gatherers that most people imagine, were actually highly civilized and created complex structures including hundreds of Stonehenge-like earthwork complexes.
Of course, this is all in line with the accounts of the first European explorers of the Amazon River as well, like Dominican Friar Gaspar de Carvajal, who accompanied explorer Francisco de Orellana on the first exploration down tributary rivers in the Andes to the mighty Amazon itself and then all the way to its mouth in 1541. Carjaval reports large “gleaming white” city complexes along the banks of the river with “fine highways” that lead deeper into the jungle to even larger cities and “very fruitful land.”
“There was one town that stretched for 15 miles without any space from house to house, which was a marvelous thing to behold,” Carvajal wrote.
Carajaval's book however, called The Discovery of the Amazon, wasn't published until the late 19th century—by which time several centuries of biologists and anthropologists had already decided that the Amazon was a wild pristine forest that was almost unsuitable for human habitation. Most of us grew up with some form of this myth, which now needs to be completely smashed if we are to really understand what the Amazon rainforest is and why it is a model for future human-nature relationships.
Dismissed as fantasy at the time, which was why his book was shelved, Carjaval's accounts have now been validated by modern discoveries. In 2008, Michael Heckenbergern, an anthropologist at the University of Florida, published a study showing that the Amazon Rainforest was crisscrossed by a vast network of “garden cities” that were densely packed and arranged in an orderly pattern far more complex than anything that was happening in Europe at the time.

“The whole landscape is almost like a latticework, the way it is gridded off,” Heckenberger told National Geographic. “The individual centers themselves are much less constructed. It is more patterned at the regional level.”
“These are far more planned at the regional level than your average medieval town,” He continued.
Beyond the superior overall urban planning, the Amazon was a super garden of delicious delights. While the Europeans were facing off against an oppressive monarchy that was famously shouting “let them eat cake,” the ancient Amazonians were scarfing down chocolate berry goodness fit for a bestselling Ben & Jerry's flavor.
In fact, when I recently visited the Ethnographic Museum in Leticia, Colombia—a charming small city on the banks of the mightiest river in the world—I saw early European maps depicting the Amazon as the “garden of eden” or the “wordly paradise” on display. After centuries of being displaced from the commons through restrictive acts like the Forest Laws, Europeans were shocked to see such an abundant permaculture agroforestry project in full glory.
With tens of thousands of acres of Amazon Rainforest being lost every single day of the year it's important that we realize we are losing more than just the living lungs of the plant, we are destroying an ancient food production system that is more advanced and sustainable than anything taking place in the modern world today.
Take the Brazil nut, for example. One of the most nutritious and largest nuts in the world—it grows in a softball-sized seed case that holds around 20 fat nuts—the Brazil Nut was planted extensively by ancient Amazonians and is now something that anthropologists look for as a marker for signs of pre-colonial human habitation in the jungle.
One of the largest and tallest trees in the Amazon and with a lifespan exceeding 1,000 years, each Brazil nut tree could feed thousands over many generations. And that's just one of the dozens of superfoods that were cultivated and widely spread across this amazing tropical food forest.
Back in the USA, where not only fruit and food bearing street trees but even front yard food gardens are mostly illegal, we have to start waking up to the fact that we live in an artificially created system of scarcity that is in stark contrast to the systems of natural abundance that indigenous societies in the Amazon developed.
As our system reaches the point where it becomes obvious to all that a change is needed, let's look a bit deeper at our definition of nature, and ourselves. What would happen if we started planting fruit and nut trees throughout our urban areas? What would happen if we started master planning our civilizations for the benefit of all? Even more, what would happen if we re-indigenized ourselves and the land and got rid of private property completely, taking back the commons for common use? Where my Robin Hoods at?
With the current movement towards urban food forests and even urban “agri-hoods” underway, the future looks green to me. But let's step it up folks, and let's put the Amazon rainforest and its inhabitants back in their rightful place as examples of how to do it right—even if we have to smash some longstanding myths in the process.

EarthRx columnist Ocean Malandra is a widely published writer that divides his time between the redwood forests of Northern California and the Amazon jungle of South America.
A FORMER board member of Norwegian oil and gas company Statoil has advised that the appointment of a new ombudsman trusted by “all stakeholders” may be the only route to resolution of the Corrib gas dispute in north Mayo.
However, the Government should never have permitted construction of the gas infrastructure in the current location, Stein Bredal, a former trade union representative on Statoil's board, said in Galway at the weekend. Statoil is a partner with Shell and Vermilion Energy in the Corrib gas project.
Mr Bredal also said that Minister of State for Natural Resources Conor Lenihan was “naive” to state that a BP Gulf of Mexico-type incident could not happen in Irish waters.
Mr Bredal spent 25 years working on offshore rigs. He took a keen interest in health and safety following to capsize of the Alexander L Kielland semi-submersible drilling rig on the Norwegian Ekofisk oilfield in March 1980, killing 123 people. He had been due to fly out to start a shift on the rig when to capsize occurred.
“Accidents do happen, even in Norway with our experience and tight regulation,” he said.
Mr Bredal was elected to Statoil's board as representative of the Federation of Offshore Workers' Trade Unions in 2000 and served until 2006.
He also unsuccessfully opposed the semi-privatisation of Statoil, as he believed semi-privatisation would dilute the emphasis on social responsibility. “Statoil's approach in Norway was to ask the community first what it wanted from a project, and to listen,” Mr Bredal said. “It was only when it joined with BP to work in other countries that it moved away from this model.”
“The Norwegian authorities were naive about this partnership” he said. “BP had the contacts but no money, and Statoil had the money but no contacts.” Mr Bredal said that one could not be “totally against” oil and gas exploitation if it brought wealth to countries, but the history of resource exploitation was not always happy.
“The reality is that good economics is often seen as more important than good relations with communities,” he said.
When oil was first found in the North Sea, Norway was “very lucky to have had some strong politicians who planned for the future”, and ensured that the Norwegian state built up expertise in the oil and gas industry, took a 78 per cent tax stake, and ran a state company, he said.
Oil and gas companies tended to act totally on behalf of shareholders, he said, and were in a position to hire the best legal expertise, and were also able to hire journalists to work for them. A common public relations strategy was to present critics of projects or project methodology as “crazies or fundamentalists”, he said.
Mr Bredal said the Norwegian public was generally “not aware” of Statoil's role in the controversial Corrib gas project in north Mayo, although there had been media coverage of several visits by delegations from Mayo, including one led by Labour Party president Michael D Higgins in 2008.
Mr Bredal was in Galway to attend Risteard Ó Dómhnaill's documentary, The Pipe, about the Corrib gas controversy, which was screened during the Galway Film Fleadh

The campaign of Green Party candidate Jill Stein made good on its promise Wednesday, filing a request for a recount of nearly 4.8 million ballots cast for president in Michigan.
Mark Brewer, the Michigan-based attorney representing Stein, arrived at the Board of Elections office in Lansing with several other attorneys representing the campaign. He brought along a check for $973,250, which represents the $125 per precinct Stein must pay for the recount.
"I and the undersigned members of my slate of electors are aggrieved on account of fraud or mistake in the canvass of the votes by the inspectors of election, and/or the returns made by the inspectors and/or by the Board of County Canvassers and/or by the Board of State Canvassers," Stein said in her request. "I request that all of the precincts and absent voter counting board precincts within the state of Michigan be recounted by hand count."

A recount could begin as soon as Friday in the state's largest 19 counties, followed by the smaller counties, with a goal of finishing the statewide recount by Dec. 10.

Lou Novak, a member of the Green Party and Detroit resident, said during a news conference after the recount request was filed: "This recount is about millions of ordinary Americans across the nation who are raising up to say enough is enough. ... Today is a turning point to fix our democracy."
J. Alex Halderman, a cybersecurity expert and computer science professor at the University of Michigan, said researchers have shown that Michigan's optical scan machines can be hacked, although he said there is no evidence that they have been hacked in previous elections.
"America's voting technology unfortunately suffers from severe cybersecurity vulnerabilities," he said. "We have one surefire defense against cyberattack and that's voting machines in which voters can fill out a paper ballot. But the paper doesn't do any good unless someone looks at it."
John Pirich, a Lansing-based attorney with Honigman Miller and one of the attorneys hired by the Trump campaign, also was on hand for the filing, but said he still has to review the recount request before determining what, if any, action will be taken. The State Board of Canvassers has scheduled a 9:30 a.m. meeting Friday to deal with any challenges to the recount, if any are filed.

The board certified the Nov. 8 election results on Monday, showing that Republican Donald Trump won the state with a total of 2,279,543 votes, which was 10,704 more than Democrat Hillary Clinton received. Stein finished fourth in the presidential race with 51,463 votes.
Brewer has acknowledged that he doesn't expect a recount — which Secretary of State Ruth Johnson has estimated could cost as much as $2 million, less the $973,250 coming from Stein, and the rest paid by the state's 83 counties — to change the outcome of the election. But the purpose is to investigate whether there is any evidence of mistakes or fraud happening during the counting of the ballots.
Johnson said it is unusual for a candidate who received only 1.07% of the presidential vote in Michigan to request a recount, "especially when there is no evidence of hacking or fraud, or even a credible allegation of any tampering."
“Nevertheless, county clerks have been gearing up to complete this recount under a very challenging deadline. They'll be working nights and weekends. I know they will do a great job because we have some of the best clerks in the country here in Michigan.”
Even though the outcome is unlikely to change, Johnson said the state and county clerks are gearing up for an unprecedented statewide recount.
Stein has said she has no evidence of fraud going into a recount of ballots in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, but wants to ensure the integrity of the election. She has raised $6.7 million to pay for the recounts in the three states.
Ronna Romney McDaniel, chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party, said the recount is a waste of taxpayer dollars.
“The filing by Jill Stein is a reckless attempt to undermine the will of Michigan voters. Jill Stein made her 1% temper tantrum official and will waste millions of Michigan taxpayers' dollars, and has acknowledged that the recount will not change anything regarding the Presidential election,” she said.

Python 3 Porting#
The 3 in 2013 is for Python 3
I tend to like projects that everyone else hates, e.g.:
Removing persistent Python objects associated with missing classes in ZODB.
Making new releases for old software that is still useful but unmaintained.

Jonathan Pitre has been on a medical roller-coaster in the week since blood tests revealed that his stem cell transplant has taken root in his bone marrow.
While his white blood cell count has soared — it's now well within the normal range — he has also suffered a series of complications that have severely tested his physical endurance.
“It has been a long few days,” said his mother, Tina Boileau. “He's been through hell.”
Pitre, 16, is battling liver, kidney and gastrointestinal problems.
He has been diagnosed with typhlitis, a serious inflammation in part of his large intestine, that brings with it risk of a bowel perforation. He has undergone a series of x-rays and ultrasounds to check for perforations, all of which have come back negative.
At the same time, Pitre is fighting a liver infection that has caused his fever to spike, and his skin to yellow. His blood pressure has fluctuated, and his kidneys are struggling to process all of the fluids and medications that have been been pumped into his body. He hasn't been allowed to eat or drink for days to protect his damaged gastrointestinal system.
Pitre will undergo surgery Wednesday to have another central line installed so that he can be fed intravenously rather than through his existing g-tube, which sends nutrition directly to his stomach.
All of the complications have made it difficult to deliver enough medication to control Pitre's pain levels, his mother said.
“It's got to get better,” she said.
Boileau is placing her faith in her son's new immune system, which has been rebuilt with the help of her donated stem cells. “His white blood cell count is at 6.7 which is amazing,” she said. “And hopefully, that helps him fight everything he's going through.”
A normal white blood cell count ranges from 4.0 to 11.
Pitre found out last Tuesday that the white blood cells in his system were all donor cells, which signalled that his transplant had successfully engrafted in his bone marrow. Bone marrow stem cells produce most of the body's blood, including the white blood cells that are responsible for fighting bacteria, viruses and other pathogens.
Pitre's lead physician, Dr. Jakub Tolar, said last week that the Russell teenager remains “extremely fragile and susceptible to all kinds of complications.” But Tolar also said the success of the transplant has established the pre-condition for his recovery.
It has now been 40 days since Pitre was infused with stem cells drawn from his mother's hip bone at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital.
In the next three months, doctors will be on the lookout for signs of acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), a complication in which the donor's white blood cells turn on the patient's tissues and attack them as “foreign.” Last week, Pitre showed signs of a rash which can sometimes be a telltale sign of the disease, but a skin biopsy showed that the problem was not related to GVHD.
Anyone who receives stem cells from another person is at risk of developing the condition, which can range from mild to life-threatening. It commonly affects the skin, liver or gastrointestinal tract.
Pitre suffers from a severe form of epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a painful and progressive skin disease that has inflicted deep, open wounds on his body.
After a season marred by struggles with knee pain which resulted in two stints on the disabled list, there is one lingering question – is there a feasible surgical remedy and if so, is it worth it?
One of Dustin Pedroia's hallmark characteristics has always been his toughness – his willingness, sometimes insistence, on playing through injuries is one of the things that has endeared him to Sox fans and allowed him to be a productive player throughout his career. This is a player, after all, who once took ground balls on his knees while recovering from a foot injury and played an entire season with a torn ligament in his thumb. His left knee, however, may prove to be a problem that even Pedroia can't out-tough. Last offseason he had an arthroscopic “cleanout” of his painful knee – despite that he still spent time on the disabled list twice and by the end of the season he was clearly not moving well on the leg and seemed to lack the ability to drive the ball at the plate. At the end of the season he alluded to the possibility of additional surgery on the knee but seemed unsure of the best plan of action, referring to the “long recovery” surgery would entail.
Given what we know about Pedroia's knee (his previous surgery, his persistent issues with the knee this year) and what we can read between the lines from his comments about the potential for an extended recovery from any additional surgery, what can we infer as to the status of his knee? My best estimate is that he has some early arthritic changes of the knee – rough spots of cartilage that were the target of his arthroscopic cleanout last year, likely in the patellofemoral part of the knee (under the kneecap). The goal of this type of procedure, a chondroplasty, is to remove any loose edges of cartilage which might be causing symptoms. However, it does not replace any lost or worn cartilage, it merely smooths the edges of whatever is damaged. The advantage of a procedure such as this is that it is a quick recovery- typically only a couple days on crutches with no running for a month or so. Pedroia could have easily had a procedure such as this in the offseason and been back in plenty of time for spring training.

The downside of a chondroplasty is that it doesn't address the root of the problem, the loss/wear of the surface cartilage, so while it frequently gives at least temporary relief, the symptoms will usually return sooner or later. If Pedroia was older or less active, he might be a candidate for some sort of knee replacement, either partial or total. Knee replacement surgery is an excellent procedure for relieving pain, but it's not compatible with high-level athletic activity. What, then, are the surgical options for a young, active patient like Pedroia?
Younger patients with cartilage injuries may be candidates for cartilage restoration procedures such as microfracture (poking holes in the bone to stimulate new cartilage growth), OATS (osteochondral allograft transfer surgery, where bone and cartilage is taken from one part of the knee or a cadaver knee and transferred to the abnormal area of cartilage) or ACI (autologous chondrocyte implantation, where a small amount of normal cartilage from the knee is harvested surgically, grown in a lab, and reimplanted in the knee at a later date).

The obvious advantage of these procedures over a chondroplasty, or “cleanout”, is that the root of the problem is being addressed- new cartilage is being grown or transferred to the area of cartilage loss. The downsides, especially when it comes to an athlete like Pedroia, are the extended rehabilitation (4-6 weeks on crutches, no running for 3-6 months, no sports activity for 6-12 months depending on the specific procedure) and the lack of guaranteed success. While the odds are good, there are certainly patients who don't do well or get back to their previous level of activity- one recent example from baseball was Grady Sizemore, who had microfracture on his knees prior to signing with the Red Sox and while he did make it back to MLB, was never quite the same player.
So where does this leave the protagonist of this tale, the Red Sox diminutive second baseman? As a 34-year-old with four years left on a contract that will pay him an average of 14 million dollars a year, the Red Sox would certainly hope for more productivity and less time on the DL from him moving forward. Having a cartilage restoration procedure might extend his career longevity, but would certainly require him to miss a significant amount of time in the near future. Even if Pedroia were to have surgery in the next few weeks, he would almost definitely miss a significant portion of next season, if not the whole year. Pedroia may decide that the potential upside of having the surgery does not outweigh the definitive downside of missing a substantial chunk of one his last seasons of professional baseball. That would leave him in his current situation, with a less-than-perfect knee which might be manageable but is likely to flare up at times over the next few seasons. At the end of the day, there is certainly no perfect solution for Pedroia and the Sox – how they handle it will certainly bear watching in the off-season and in upcoming years.
Police in Slidell, Louisiana say they've caught a man who helped scam people out of money by using one of the oldest scams online: the "Nigerian Prince" scam.
Investigators say 67-year-old Michael Neu was involved in hundreds of financial transactions that were the result of spam emails like the one below.
[DISCUSS THIS STORY ON FACEBOOK]
The emails claim to be sent by an important foreign figure or dignitary reaching out to you for help. Despite the name, the emails come from many parts of the world and scammers are based in many countries, not just Nigeria. The dignitary offers the recipient a great sum of money in exchange for a little financial help. (They are commonly called "Nigerian Prince" email scams because that was the type of dignitary frequently used by scammers during the scam's rise to prominence in in the mid-2000's.)
Similar emails have been sent to inboxes across the country for nearly two decades. While most people immediately recognize the scam email for what for it is, some of the less tech-savvy amongst us have lost millions of dollars to the scams over the years.
Neu is facing 269 counts of Wire Fraud and Money Laundering. And yes, police say Neu did send some of that money to Nigeria in this case. Meanwhile, the investigation continues, but police say finding scammers outside the country will be difficult.

"Nigerian Prince" Scam Example Email
"Dear Sir:
I have been requested by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company has recently concluded a large number of contracts for oil exploration in the sub-Sahara region. The contracts have immediately produced moneys equaling US$40,000,000. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company is desirous of oil exploration in other parts of the world, however, because of certain regulations of the Nigerian Government, it is unable to move these funds to another region.
You assistance is requested as a non-Nigerian citizen to assist the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, and also the Central Bank of Nigeria, in moving these funds out of Nigeria. If the funds can be transferred to your name, in your United States account, then you can forward the funds as directed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company. In exchange for your accommodating services, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company would agree to allow you to retain 10%, or US$4 million of this amount.
However, to be a legitimate transferee of these moneys according to Nigerian law, you must presently be a depositor of at least US$100,000 in a Nigerian bank which is regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria.
If it will be possible for you to assist us, we would be most grateful. We suggest that you meet with us in person in Lagos, and that during your visit I introduce you to the representatives of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, as well as with certain officials of the Central Bank of Nigeria.
Please call me at your earliest convenience at 18-467-4975. Time is of the essence in this matter; very quickly the Nigerian Government will realize that the Central Bank is maintaining this amount on deposit, and attempt to levy certain depository taxes on it.
Yours truly,
Prince Alyusi Islassis"

Facility personnel attempt to revive a detainee who swallowed detergent.
Screen shot/Guardian
A series of reports in The Guardian and other outlets describe a grim scene at an Australian immigration detention center, as detainees seeking asylum have protested their treatment by reportedly refusing food, sewing their lips together, swallowing razor blades, and drinking detergent.
The crisis is taking place at Australia's Manus Island facility for asylum seekers, which is actually located in Papua New Guinea. Some individuals who have traveled by boat to Australia seeking asylum—the BBC says most are from Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Iraq, and Iran—are sent to the facility. Under Australian law, those who qualify as refugees will be resettled in Papua New Guinea or Cambodia, not in Australia. Manus Island's detainees are upset by the length of time they have been held in official limbo—some have allegedly been in detention for 450 days—and because they believe they will be subject to violent attacks by Papua New Guinea residents if they are resettled locally.
Detainees began hunger strikes on Jan. 13, and more severe acts of self-harm followed. A number of “ringleaders” in the protests have reportedly been arrested and moved to a local jail, and the Guardian says individuals have also been arrested for using communication devices—which are, according to the Australian government, not prohibited at the facility. The hunger strikes continue.
India's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, in its thirty ninth flight (PSLV-C37), launches the 714 kg Cartosat-2 series satellite for earth observation and 103 co-passenger satellites together weighing about 663 kg at lift-off into a 505 km polar Sun Synchronous Orbit (SSO). PSLV-C37 was launched from the First Launch Pad (FLP) of Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) SHAR, Sriharikota. This was the sixteenth flight of PSLV in 'XL' configuration (with the use of solid strap-on motors).
The co-passenger satellites comprised of 101 nano satellites, one each from Kazakhstan, Israel, The Netherlands, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and 96 from the United States of America (USA), as well as two Nano satellites from India. The total weight of all these satellites carried on-board PSLV-C37 was about 1377 kg.
PSLV-C37 also carried two ISRO Nano satellites (INS-1A and INS-1B), as co-passenger satellites. These two satellites carry a total of four different payloads from Space Applications Centre (SAC) and Laboratory for Electro Optics Systems (LEOS) of ISRO for conducting various experiments.
The 101 International customer Nano satellites were launched as part of the commercial arrangements between Antrix Corporation Limited (Antrix), a Government of India company under Department of Space (DOS), the commercial arm of ISRO and the International customers.
PSLV-C37/Cartosat-2 Series Satellite was successfully launched on Wednesday, February 15, 2017 at 9:28 Hrs IST from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota.
For the 1933 cartoon featuring Krazy Kat, see Russian Dressing (film)
Russian dressing is a piquant American salad dressing consisting of mayonnaise with ketchup and other ingredients. Russian dressing is a key ingredient in a Reuben sandwich.
History [ edit ]
Russian dressing is mentioned as early as 1900 in American sources.[1] It is also documented in a 1910 catering book as an alternative to vinaigrette for dressing tomatoes or asparagus.[2] A 1913 cookbook has a recipe which is a vinaigrette with paprika and mustard.[3] A mayonnaise-based recipe is documented in 1914.[4]
Local historians claim that the mayonnaise-based version was invented in Nashua, New Hampshire, by James E. Colburn in the 1910s.[5] A 1927 biographical article calls him "the originator and first producer of that delectable condiment known as Russian salad dressing".[6] Colburn had been selling "Colburn's Mayonnaise salad dressing" at his store since at least 1910.[7]
“ To have conferred upon the epicurean tastes of a great body of people a delicacy at once as refined as it is permanent in its popularity is not to have lived in vain; rather it is to have added to the joy of living. ... [Colburn] hit upon an assembly of ingredients, which he named Russian salad dressing, ... [and earned] wealth on which he was enabled to retire. ... As he rests on his laurels, he is conscious of having done his part well in conferring a blessing upon the people who have learned the art of eating well. ” — Hobart Pillsbury, New Hampshire Resources ... [6]
Certainly by 1914, Colburn's company was manufacturing it,[8] and distributing it to retailers and hotels. He earned enough from its sale that he retired in 1924.[6]
It is unknown in traditional Russian cuisine, but Russians call it "ketchunnaise" (кетчунез).
Preparation [ edit ]
Typically piquant, it is today characteristically made of a blend of mayonnaise and ketchup complemented with such additional ingredients as horseradish, pimentos, chives, and spices.[9][10]
Uses [ edit ]
Besides being used as a salad dressing, Russian dressing is also used as a sandwich spread for Reuben sandwiches.
Related sauces [ edit ]
Russian dressing has largely been supplanted by Thousand Island dressing, which is sweeter and less spicy than Russian.[6]
Other combinations of mayonnaise and ketchup, but without the spicy ingredients, are known as fry sauce or other names, and typically served with french fries or tostones.
Tartar sauce has the piquant ingredients of Russian dressing, without the ketchup. It is typically served with fried fish.
Marie Rose sauce is similar to Russian dressing, but with different piquant ingredients. It is typically served with seafood.
A variant known as red Russian dressing is very much like Catalina or French dressing.[11]
In Germany, a similar salad dressing is called "American dressing".[12][13]
An unusual, exciting, or dangerous experience. Most of the time these blog posts fade away quickly and it's hard to know if they've been read much, but very occasionally one gains a bit of momentum and gets shared around. A few weeks ago ‘An Open Letter To Self-Proclaimed Adventurers' caught a little pace and it was surprising to see a few reactions. In hindsight the cloudiness of that post is a bit cringeworthy.
One reaction was “That's an idiotic piece. Getting kidnapped is not an adventure, going over Niagara is a gamble not an adventure. The only one of the 3 stories that is an adventure is ‘No Picnic on Mount Kenya'.” It was tempting to write back with ‘ur an idiotic piece' but this is the internet and adding fuel to the fire never works well. Another reaction was “I don't get it. Does it mean we should all just stay at home because everything's been done already?”. This was saddening as that conclusion is the opposite of how it was supposed to come across. Oops, sorry!
Adventure, going off the dictionary definition, is: an unusual and exciting or dangerous experience. Seeking those experiences is totally worthwhile, for everyone. Doing the thing you've wanted to do for ages helps you grow. Ticking off that trip or that thing which frightens you but calls out to you anyway. Has everything been done? No, that's impossible because it's subjective. From getting over your stage-fright and walking onto a standup comedy stage for the first time, to riding a bike a long way. It is infinite, it is for everyone, it is worthy, it is real, and simply embracing adventurous experiences has a positive impact.
The intended meaning was: If you want to go and have an adventure, go and do it. Don't be put off by titles, or inexperience, or lack of ‘the best gear'. Do the thing that calls out to you. If you're a receptionist – you can have an epic adventure. If you're a teacher – you can too. If you work in insurance – you can as well. And you should! I really hope that anyone reading this will at some point pursue their big adventure (whatever that means) that is close to their heart.
Finally, one person said: “so are you saying that people shouldn't write about their adventures?”. No, who is anyone to say that? Crumbs, this blog does just that! Quite the opposite – if you like sharing stories, that is awesome! And reading about people seeking out new experiences is brilliant. From people who frequently go on trips as a career, cool, but everyone else too. Say a caretaker who just ran a fell-race, a student who launched a satellite, a fisherman who plucked up the courage to take part in a rap battle. (Basically, the original post was an ill-thought-out vent about seeing a small few acts like they owned something that can't be owned.)
Moving on to the cool stuff!
If you were asked to choose, can a single moment rise to the top of many? I asked some peeps who've chased experiences that called out to them, one thing. To describe their most adventurous moment. Their responses are fun and insightful and sometimes unexpected – enjoy, then get planning!

Leon McCarron:
“I've had my fair share of pretty ‘adventurous' (or downright stupid) moments – listening to bears sniff at the flysheet of my tent in California, teetering over precipitous cliffs in Chinese mountains, capsizing a packraft in a remote Iranian gorge… when it comes to doing silly things in exciting places, I'm a pro. But I also know that without a doubt my most adventurous moment of all was very different from those higher adrenalin escapades.
The bravest and more daring thing I've ever done was cross the George Washington Bridge out of New York City on my first big trip. Physically there was nothing hard about it, nor logistically – there was even a bike path all the way across. Mentally, however… man, mentally it was a war zone. Every fibre of my being was terrified at the prospect of leaving behind all that I knew; swapping the familiar and the comfortable for a heavy bike, a cheap tent and an endless white line heading west. I would have found it so easy to give up right there, to turn around and make plans to fly home to the UK. Somehow – through stubbornness, stupidity and a small but growing realisation that things don't always have to be fun to be worthwhile – I pushed on over the bridge, into New Jersey, and into the adventure of a lifetime. Since then, I've never looked back.”

“I suppose people would think that racing mountain bikes down mountains at speeds of 60mph every weekend all around the world for a living was adventure enough but I disagree!
You get so used to whatever you do day to day, no matter how adventurous it may seem, so adventures to me are things that I don't get to experience, days out on the sea in boats, inflatable kayaks through quaint towns, but my most brilliant adventure that I still love thinking of was taking myself to Europe when I was injured and having a year off, I must've been 19, I camped for weeks in my tent with my bike, at lakesides and up mountains, the thunderstorms from the tent were amazing, I rode every day exploring the mountains, collecting wild strawberries and bilberries to go with breakfast, washing in the lakes and waterfalls, stealing vegetables from gardens (!!) and making friends with locals who plied me with homemade alcohol.
It was one of the most exhilarating, free, happy times I've ever had. A real adventure because I was away from the normal, away from technology, away from comfort, it was real living, being as close to mother nature as I could be, to me that is what an adventure should be.”

Tom Allen:
“I was dragging my bike through a thousand kilometres of sand towards Dongola in northern Sudan. The Nile lay to my right, shimmering, tempting, as I sweated in the midday Saharan heat. I wondered what was on the other side of the longest river in the world. (Nothing, according to Google Maps.) The idea took hold, and when I arrived at the next Nubian village I tracked down the owner of a small boat and convinced him to give me a ride. And so it was about halfway across the world's longest river, outboard motor sputtering, cool water spray on my sunburnt face, that I realised that not only did I have absolutely no idea where I was going, but that this leap into the unknown was precisely what made me feel so damn alive. This, right now, was my most adventurous moment to date.”

Sarah Thomson (photo: Kate Czuczman):
“To me an adventure means taking a risk. Sometimes you run into trouble, and sometimes it turns out to be the most epic moment of a lifetime. One of my most adventurous moments was whist backpacking with a friend of mine in Indonesia. We awoke early, packed our rucksacks and headed off with no idea of direction. We passed peaceful lagoons, chilled out cafes and tiptoed through local farmlands, attempting to climb coconut trees for refreshment on the way. We walked for hour upon hour until we reached what we believed to be the end of the world! A huge of bank of black sand saw the end of the ever growing palm trees and we both stopped in awe. We laughed and told stories the whole way and yet when we reached this bay of black we had nothing to say, but just sat and soaked in the love of a wonderful adventure.”

Charley and Sophie Radcliffe:
Charley: “I am constantly challenging the title of most adventurous moment but they keep having one thing in common: being somewhere I didn't know I could get – whether I'm leading a hard (for me!) rock route, or running London to Brighton across fields and country paths. The moments that get your heart rate up, make you worry, and then break through the other side.”
Sophie: “For me adventure is all about trying something new, embracing the unknown and having the faith in myself that I'll get there but also knowing that failure is part of the journey. It's about sharing the highs and lows with friends, making new bonds, strengthening existing friendships, feeling like you've shared something you'll never forget. It's about the rewards and how well deserved they feel! The accomplishment, feeling of confidence, the beer and eating of cake. It's about living and feeling alive.”

George Foster:
“I used to think I was adventurous but the furthest I've been from civilisation in the form of say a phone or a car or whatever would be a few days camping in Scotland or a couple of days on a mountain in the Indian Himalayas. Not exactly Ernest Shackleton. I guess I may have done adventurous things to those uninitiated with fell running or those whose definition of adventure is markedly different to mine. It's all a matter of perspective.
If it's what you're into, then all my adventures in running have been adventures of the mind. Many hundreds of people have run further or faster. Maybe not so many have done so at night, over hills, in the wind and the sweeping rain. Then again, maybe you have, in which case skip to the next guy!
This is the closest I've come to a real adventure. Something where the outcome is far from certain. Running towards the mountains without a headtorch to see what it's like. The feeling when you float up the steepness and come face to face with the moon. Uncertain starlight giving way to a flood of brilliant radiance and you are able to pick out instantly a boulder here, or there, a puddle left from the evening downpour. All that was invisible moments before, now open for your private viewing.
That doesn't have much to do with the mind at first glance. I'd argue that it's experiences like that which remind you why you race on the fells. I need reminding sometimes when I'm racing. Legs melting into screaming lungs. The challenge in a lot of these isn't to win but often just to finish. That's the mental side. The not knowing is the adventure. The not letting your body give in when you do know. I think it takes a lot of courage to run up a hill into a gathering blizzard. Courage… and stupidity.
Anyone can have an adventure, though. As I said it's a matter of perspective. When I'm 94 I'm gonna relish the not knowing if I'll be able to make it to the toilet without pissing myself. How adventurous is that?!”

BEIJING — Fang Binxing is known here as the “Father of the Wall,” that is, the Great Firewall — the sprawling system of technological controls in China that has created a parallel online world, or “Chinternet,” where global favorites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook are blocked.
In fact, it's fair to say that Mr. Fang is unpopular among quite a few of China's hundreds of millions of netizens, though he does have his admirers, including among those who support the government's large-scale efforts to “weiwen,” or maintain stability.
Just how unpopular he is been demonstrated again over the weekend when his New Year's microblog greeting was promptly bombarded with messages telling him to “go to hell,” according to netizens (it wasn't possible to read each message, but Mr. Fang's post had been forwarded over 23,000 times at the time of writing).
Pithily, in one word repeated again and again, the critics said: “gun,” or “滚.” (The word literally means “roll,” or, in an officially accepted slang variation, “beat it.”)

“Fang Binxing sends everyone New Year's greetings! May all be joyful and successful in the Year of the Snake!” he posted on his Sina Weibo, or microblog, account, on Saturday, continuing with salutations to his university (he is the president of the University of Posts and Telecommunications in Beijing) and a poem.
“Yesterday, a university president wished everyone Happy New Year on his microblog account and the result was he got over 10,000 forwards saying ‘go to hell,' ” He Bing, deputy director of the School of Law at the China University of Political Science and Law, posted to his nearly 395,000 followers on Sina Weibo.
“As long as people like this continue to be the presidents of universities there's no hope for China,” Mr. He's post continued. By Tuesday afternoon it had been forwarded about 3,700 times.
Mr. Fang acknowledged in an interview in 2011 that he had designed major parts of the Great Firewall. He is a lightning rod for protest among the Internet-savvy who want broader freedom of speech.
He's had eggs and a shoe thrown at him, and in 2011 had to close his newly opened microblog after thousands of users left comments within hours — almost all of them critical, the populist newspaper Global Times noted.
“I regard the dirty abuse as a sacrifice for my country,” the newspaper quoted Mr. Fang as saying.
Attention is growing around the world on how the Chinese state uses the Internet, with The Washington Post reporting today on a new intelligence assessment in the United States. The newspaper writes that according to a National Intelligence Estimate, the United States is the target of “a massive, sustained cyber-espionage campaign” and that China is “the country most aggressively seeking to penetrate the computer systems of American businesses and institutions to gain access to data that could be used for economic gain.”
The Post is one of a number of U.S. news organizations, including The New York Times, that recently reported having been subjected to cyberattacks believed to have Chinese origins. (The Times has been blocked in China since running a story last year about wealth accumulated by the family of the outgoing prime minister, Wen Jiabao.)
Back in Beijing, Mr. Fang hasn't posted anything since his New Year greeting, so it isn't clear how he feels about the reaction to it. Meanwhile, word continues to circulate that more “upgrades,” or tightening, of the Great Firewall lie ahead.
In December, several overseas-based companies that provide VPNs to both non-Chinese and Chinese users in the country (a VPN, or virtual private network, enables users to get around the Chinternet, or “cross the Wall” as it's known here, by logging on via overseas servers) said their services had been interrupted.
In what some read as a warning, Mr. Fang appeared to tell Global Times that overseas-based companies offering VPNs to people in China must register with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
“I haven't heard that any foreign companies have registered,” he said. Unregistered VPN service providers are not protected by Chinese law and any company running a VPN business should realize it has a responsibility to register, he said, according to Global Times.
The British prime minister has become more prime ministerial and less like a president
The July issue of Parliamentary Affairs is now online and this issue's Editor's Choice is The Prime Ministerialisation of the British Prime Minister by Keith Dowding. The full article is free to download from the Oxford Journals website.
For forty years or more commentators have suggested that the British prime minister is becoming presidential. Whilst the recent coalition government has given some pause to that claim it shows little sign of permanently abating.
There are two issues here. One is the claim that the British prime minister is becoming increasingly pre-eminent in relation to his or her cabinet colleagues. The other is that the prime minister is becoming more like a president, with the US President as the paradigm. The first claim might have some truth in it – though one can look back to dominant prime ministers such as Churchill or Gladstone – related to enhanced prime ministerial resources, deriving from the growth of the cabinet office and the prime minister's own office, the growth of political advisers, the increasing use of cabinet committees and one-to-one meetings with ministers rather than decisions taken in full cabinet. Meanwhile, the line-by-line budget oversight that the Treasury now enjoys means that the centre is increasingly involved in policy formation through budgetary detail. A case can be made that growing resources are making the prime minister more powerful vis-à-vis ministers.
However, some of this resource growth is the result of the increasingly complex reach of government. Prime ministers have always felt that they can barely keep up with what government is doing; and as departments extend the scope of their activity, the centre needs to expand to keep up. Besides, cabinet government has never really been about 22 people sitting around a single table. It has always involved meetings between departmental servants and ministers of various sorts as policy is hammered out. Greater budgetary oversight enhances Treasury more than prime ministerial powers – as Brown demonstrated under Blair. Nevertheless, whilst the claim of increasing prime ministerial power might be overplayed at times, it has some merit. However, it does not add up to presidentialisation: if prime ministers do increase their powers to such an extent that true cabinet government is threatened, that would mean a prime ministerialisation, not a presidentialisation of government. The nature of parliamentary systems makes prime ministers more powerful than presidents. Strengthening prime ministers takes them further away from being presidents.
Presidentialisation theorists suggest the increasing resources of prime ministers are making them more presidential. The prime minister's office is compared to the presidential office, but the role of each is entirely different. For the prime minister's strengthening control mechanisms are directed at the executive, to dominate ministers and their departments, whilst the executive offices of the US president are directed at lobbying and persuading the legislature. In the UK virtually all legislation emanates from the executive; in the US it comes from the legislature. One mark of that is that we tend to talk of parliaments – talking shops – in parliamentary systems; but of legislatures – where the real business of making laws is done – in presidential systems. In fact the US President often signs off on legislation that he does not really agree with. The Congressional Quarterly's Presidential Support Score is a well-established measure of the frequency with which lawmakers vote in accord with the president's position; over the last fifty years the CQ score has varied from 80 to around 98. Can you imagine a prime minister signing off around 1/5 of legislation not in accord with his wishes, as did Kennedy in 1962 or Bush in 2001?
Some claim the growing personalisation of politics is making prime ministers more presidential. The media concentrate their attention upon prime ministers more than they once did, whilst the centre increasingly exercises controls over the media appearances and statements of ministers (something that Cameron relaxed at first but then tightened as he realized the damage that could be caused without control). The advent of the Downing Street Press Conference has certainly bestowed a more presidential air on prime ministers, but these effects are all superficial.
The personalisation of politics plays out differently in parliamentary than presidential systems. In parliamentary systems increasingly, it seems, the fate of MPs rests with the popularity of their party leaders; hence the threat to Brown prior to the 2010 general election, while the Australian Labor Party dumped first Rudd leading up to one election, then Gillard in the run-up to another. In the USA personalisation enables congressmen to distance themselves from unpopular leaders. In parliamentary systems candidates are tied closely to the policies of the party and its leader. In August 2012 the US Republican party's official anti-abortion position (adopted by the platform committee) was that abortion should be illegal in all circumstances; but the party chairman Reince Pribus admitted, ‘This is the platform of the Republican party. It's not the platform of Mitt Romney'. In the US the ‘party leader' does not lead, or even follow, the party on policy.
The key fact is that British prime ministers are agenda-setters, presidents are veto-players. The media, parliament and, of course, ‘events', can seize the agenda. Presidents, by and large, are veto players who can only set the agenda through their power of persuasion. Obama started with a domestic programme of which healthcare reform was a central plank, but the final bill was a compromise between the two houses of Congress without Obama's preferred public option. Obama, like most presidents, ends up concentrating upon foreign affairs where he can set the agenda more.
The British system has not become more presidential; if anything it has become more prime ministerial. Coalition government has done little to change that – though if the Liberals had played coalition politics properly, as the game is played in the rest of Europe, any such prime ministerialisation might at least have been paused. Parliamentary and presidential systems are institutionally distinct, which means that universal forces such as personalisation play out differently and are as likely to drive them further apart as bring them closer together.

Wearing a charcoal suit as disordered as the white hair encircling his head, and flanked by just two aides as he walked to the podium, Vermont independent Bernie Sanders laid out his motivation for seeking the Democratic Party's nomination Thursday before an audience of about 100 reporters, camera operators, aides, and onlookers (including one man who wore a hemp ballcap).
Workers are toiling more hours for low wages, while 99 percent of new income goes to the top 1 percent, he said.
"That type of economy is not only immoral, it is not only wrong," Sanders said, speaking without notes. "It is unsustainable."
He sounded passionate, progressive, and populist. He also sounded a lot like Hillary Clinton. And therein lies the rub for the long shot of all long shots: a senator who takes his business in Washington seriously but is unwilling to wear the label of a party he hopes to represent in the 2016 general election.
I'm an independent, he insisted when asked whether he was a Democrat.
That's why Sanders is the only politician who could get away with announcing an outsider's campaign for president from the shadow of the Capitol Dome on a grassy plain called the "Senate swamp."
His fans hope that he can pull off the unlikeliest of upsets. And Sanders said he's undaunted by the odds, having won 71 percent of the vote in his last reelection after once losing a statewide race with 1 percent of the vote.
But Clinton's move to the left has the effect of crowding out longtime liberal stalwarts who occupy space similar to Sanders's on the political spectrum. Most, like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have passed on running against her, knowing they can hold her feet to the fire from the sidelines and that they stand little chance of defeating her juggernaut.
To the left, to the left
The issues Sanders identified as his causes in this campaign — economic justice, climate change, and reining in the influence of big spenders in politics and government — are all now standard fare for the much better funded, much better known, and much more big-D "Democratic" Clinton.
She noted as much on Twitter Thursday, and Sanders responded in kind:
Thanks @HillaryClinton. Looking forward to debating the big issues: income inequality, climate change & getting big money out of politics. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 30, 2015
Clinton spoke of cycles of poverty and inequality just yesterday in a speech on criminal justice reform at Columbia University.
"Our goal must truly be inclusive and lasting prosperity that's measured by how many families get ahead and stay ahead, how many children climb out of poverty and stay out of prison, how many young people can go to college without breaking the bank, how many new immigrants can start small businesses, how many parents can get good jobs that allow them to balance the demands of work and family," she said.
Like Sanders, Clinton has mocked climate-science deniers and has made campaign finance reform a pillar of her agenda in this campaign — even as she solicits money from megadonors such as Ambassador Elizabeth Frawley Bagley, a longtime ally who was scheduled to host one of three fundraisers for Clinton in Washington on Thursday.
That's not to say there's less than a dime's worth of difference between Clinton and Sanders. They have had substantive differences in the past, and no amount of shading will ever make her the instinctive populist that he has been for decades.
The differences
Many years ago, Clinton was a middle-class kid in the Chicago suburbs. She has since become a jet-set multimillionaire former first lady and presidential nomination frontrunner. There has been a bubble around her for a long time, which is why her comments about leaving the White House "dead broke" were mercilessly ridiculed. Her home in Washington is on Embassy Row and would probably sell for more than $4 million.
Unlike Clinton and the vast majority of his Senate colleagues, Sanders has parlayed his career in public service into a lifestyle that is less than lavish. He makes $174,000, a salary frozen since 2009. He lives in a narrow, two-floor, one-bedroom townhouse on Capitol Hill that he bought (from me) for less than $500,000. There's a window air-conditioning unit on the second floor because the 125-year-old home doesn't have central air. It's worth the price of a mansion in Iowa or New Hampshire or Vermont, but it's modest for a walk-to-work crash pad a few blocks from the Senate.
His net worth, based on disclosed ranges, is somewhere between $110,000 and $551,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. He has debts of up to $65,000 or so. If he gave three or four Clinton speeches, he could retire. Not that he would do either. Sanders said Thursday that he grew up poor, that his father dropped out of high school, and that his brother introduced him to books, of which there were not a lot around the Sanders household.
Their personal finances and economic backgrounds will matter in some Democratic circles. Clinton's shift toward populism doesn't feel authentic to party progressives who have watched her and her husband buck-rake from billionaires to boost their campaigns, their foundation, and their own personal fortune.
Sanders is proud that he's never run a negative ad; Clinton made her 2008 campaign about tearing down Barack Obama as unprepared for the presidency. It's unimaginable that Sanders could beat Clinton without hammering the differences between them on substance. And he said Thursday that it is important to define those differences.
"I voted against the war in Iraq"
At first, Sanders seemed uneasy about taking on Clinton directly.
"It's too early," he started to say when asked where he differed from Clinton on policy. "We don't know what Hillary's stances are."
Then, he acceded.
"I voted against the war in Iraq," he said of the 2002 roll call that helped sink Clinton's 2008 candidacy. He spoke of his leadership against the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which Clinton's State Department team worked on and which she has tried to give herself wiggle room on in recent weeks. And he talked about his fervent opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline, about which Clinton has always been studiously quiet — because of or despite — the lead role the State Department played in reviewing the project when she was in the State Department.
It's not at all clear that any of those issues will be dispositive in a Democratic primary. While Clinton's comfort with the use of military force is a mismatch for a Democratic Party base that abhorred both Vietnam and Iraq, the latter war is less of a political issue now than it was when a full complement of American soldiers were in the Middle East.
Democrats worry about a return to Clinton-style trade deals such as NAFTA that they believe rob American workers to the benefit of multinational corporations. But Clinton hasn't come down firmly on TPP, and NAFTA, despite hurting many other Democrats, did little damage to Bill Clinton in his 1996 run to reelection. And the most prominent opponent of the Keystone pipeline, billionaire Tom Steyer, is a longtime Clinton ally, contributor, and fundraiser.
Running to win
Before Sanders's 10-minute press conference, reporters milled around the Senate swamp and joked about how it would be the biggest crowd of journalists Sanders had ever attracted to an event. When Sanders walked up, with a rolled up piece of paper in his hand, he had to navigate around the cameras to take his place at the podium. He seemed a little surprised by the attention.
"Thank you," he said into a microphone, recoiling a bit from the electric sound of his own voice and issuing a quick "Whoa!"
Save for the unusually large audience for him, Sanders's announcement was understated as presidential kickoffs go. He might well have been announcing the introduction of a dairy amendment to the farm bill from a location so close to the Senate floor that he closed the press conference by saying he had to get back to work and then walking a couple of hundred feet to the Capitol.
There are some who believe Sanders is running to make a point, to elevate the issues he cares about. Others debate whether his entry will force Clinton to move to the left on issues in a way that hurts her in a general election or will give her a point against which to triangulate and present herself as more moderate in November 2016.
But Sanders's entry isn't likely to have much effect on Clinton because they already sound so much alike.
When she launched her 2008 campaign, Clinton famously said, "I'm in, and I'm in to win."
Asked Thursday whether he was running for the sake of the issues he cares about, rather than as a serious candidate for the nomination, Sanders, sounding a lot like Clinton, rejected that construct.
"We're in this race to win," he said.
The numbers from the statistics bureau told Streets the total amount of mercury that might be emitted, but he also needed to know how much actually made it into the air. To obtain that information, he turned to pollution detectives—a group of professional contacts he had met at conferences, along with graduate students who spent time in his lab. Most of the time, Chinese factories turned these “spies” away. “Factory owners had nothing to gain and a lot to lose,” Streets says. “They were nervous that the results would get leaked to the government.”
Yet some of Streets's moles got through by guaranteeing that the data would stay anonymous. Once inside, they took samples of raw materials—zinc ore in a smelting facility, for example—and installed chemical detectors in smokestacks. After a few days of data collection, they passed the information to Streets.
The statistics Streets collected were hardly airtight. Factory foremen and provincial officials were not above providing inflated data to make themselves look more productive, and the managers who were willing to let his inspectors take measurements were often the very ones with nothing to hide. “There's still a lot of uncertainty,” Streets concedes, “but we know more than we did before.”
In 2005 Streets and his team reported their first tally of human-generated mercury emissions in China, for the year 1999. The scientists estimated the amount at 590 tons (the United States emitted 117 tons). Almost half resulted from the smelting of metals—especially zinc, because its ores contain a high concentration of mercury. Coal-burning power plants accounted for another 38 percent of Chinese mercury emissions, and that percentage may be going up. As recently as 2007, China was building two new power plants a week, according to John Ashton, a climate official in the United Kingdom.
Streets's team published a subsequent inventory estimating that China's mercury emissions had jumped to 767 tons in 2003. “Mercury emissions in China have grown at about 5 to 6 percent a year,” he says. “It's pretty much undeniable.”
Streets had shown that China was churning out mercury, but he was left with a big uncertainty: What happened to it on its journey aloft? Finding the answer fell to Hans Friedli, a chemist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) who had spent 33 years working for Dow Chemical. Friedli had found his own path into the esoteric world of pollution forensics. Back in the early 1990s, a conversation with his neighbor, an NCAR scientist, sparked an interest in wildfires, a major source of mercury emissions. By 1998 he had a full-time job tracking the toxin for NCAR.
With its copious mercury emissions (not only from industry but also from volcanoes, wildfires, and dust storms), Asia drew Friedli's interest. China would never allow him to do aerial studies in its airspace, but in 2001 he heard about research flights off the coasts of Japan, Korea, and China designed to track dust particles emanating from the mainland. Friedli convinced the research team to take him along to measure mercury concentrations in the atmosphere. Throughout April 2001, 19 researchers, professors, and grad students took 16 flights aboard a cavernous retired Navy C-130 plane custom fit with 19 instruments for measuring pollutants like carbon monoxide, sulfur, and ozone.
During each flight, Friedli sat at his station awaiting readouts from his mercury sensor: an intake valve that sucked in air and guided it over a gold cartridge within the plane. Any mercury in the air would be absorbed by the gold. Every five minutes the instrument rapidly heated the gold, releasing any trapped mercury.
Plumes of mercury-laced air near the earth's surface are mixed with other pollutants, but at 20,000 feet Friedli discovered concentrated mercury plumes soaring eastward toward North America. He concluded those plumes must have circled the entire globe at least once, releasing more ephemeral pollutants like carbon monoxide so that the mercury stood out even more.
Eager to follow the trail of Asian mercury plumes, Friedli set his sights across the Pacific, off the West Coast of the United States. In a series of 11 research flights in 2002, he identified a plume that looked very much like the ones he'd found near China the year before. Specifically, the plume had a carbon monoxide-to-mercury ratio that served as a fingerprint for gases from the same source.
What Friedli detected was just one detail of a much larger picture. Mercury plumes can wobble in latitude and altitude or park themselves in one spot for days on end. Emissions from China—and from the United States, and indeed from every industrial country—feed a network of air currents that, as equal-opportunity polluters, serve up toxic mercury around the world.
Drawing insights from research by Friedli and Streets, Jaffe looked at his data anew. If mercury were arriving from China, he should be able to detect it, yet his operation on Cheeka Peak showed no such signal. Conducting reconnaissance from a plane, he realized why. The peak, at 1,500 feet, hovered below the mercury plume line. Seeking a higher perch, he chose Mount Bachelor, a ski resort in central Oregon with an altitude of 9,000 feet.
In late winter 2004, Jaffe and his students huddled deep in their down jackets, bracing against a bitter gale that buffeted the chairlift ferrying them and their costly equipment to the summit. Inside the mountaintop lodge they installed a small computer lab and extended tubes outside to vacuum up the air. Later that year they conducted a similar experiment in Okinawa, Japan.

There was one game in the NHL playoffs last night. The Tampa Bay Lightning inched a step closer to a Stanley Cup Final return, sinking the Penguins in overtime by a final score of 4-3.
Despite the frequent punishment he's absorbed, the OT winner was off of Tyler Johnson's back as he battled in front of the net:
It's going to be a happy flight back to Tampa for Game 6 thanks to this goal. #StanleyCup #PITvsTBL pic.twitter.com/gOBh03J7hb — #StanleyCup Playoffs (@NHL) May 23, 2016
The Pens returned to Marc-Andre Fleury as starter in this one. Fleury looked sharp early but finished with only 21 saves on the night. Expect the goalie carousel in Pittsburgh to spin full speed until game six.
The Penguins are now one win away from elimination and the Lightning are poised to compete for the Cup without their biggest star and their number one goaltender.
Incredible.
Before the game chart, the usual preamble on how to read the graph:
A couple of notes on reading the charts:
the Corsi differential is based on 5v5 play and is score-adjusted, as per war-on-ice.
players at the top (with bars extending to the right) posted positive differentials (good)
players at the bottom (and to the left) posted negative differentials (bad)
the colour of each bar represents the player's time on ice (see legend at the bottom)
each players individual Corsi For attempts are included in parentheses a player with a strong C +/- but a (0) for iCF didn't directly contribute to his strong showing. a player with a weak C +/- but a strong iCF score (i.e. greater than 5) may have been hindered by linemates. Maybe.
like any reasonable person, I don't believe that Corsi is everything. But it's a very important part of the.
On to the game chart…
The all-situations Corsi battle was almost dead-even in this one. The Lightning managed 56 shot attempts and Pittsburgh managed 54. At 5v5, the Penguins had the edge.
Maatta, Lovejoy, and Kunitz led the way. Malkin, Rust, and Bonino were at the top as well. Only Koekkoek, Drouin, Carle, Paquette, and Palat registered a positive Corsi differential for the Lightning.
Though neither exceeded -10, Letang and Crosby were the worst two on the game chart. That's extremely odd. Even crazier is that Letang posted 8 iCF, the game-high, while finishing at the bottom. Callahan had 7 iCF and finished as a negative as well.
In the end, the Penguins face elimination as the extremely resilient Lightning are poised to return to the Cup Final. This will make for a must-see game six.
Lightning lead series 3-2.

Two passengers travelling on a Central Railway train lost their lives on Monday evening after falling off the train due to overcrowding. According to the General Railway Police (GRP) officials, one was around 25 years old and the other was 30. Both were found unconscious and were taken to Sion Hospital by GRP.Spokesperson of GRP, Ritesh Ahire, said, “Both were taken to the hospital, but were declared dead on arrival. We are in the process of indentifying the deceased.”The rise in number of deaths due to overcrowding has been a cause of concern for the railway department. “In 2015, 806 commuters died after they fell down from overcrowded trains and 1,697 were injured,” said a GRP official.Last year, the death of 21-year-old Bhavesh Nakate between Kopar and Diva had raised questions about safety concerns of commuters using transport system that is a operating way beyond its capacity. Nakate's fall, which was recorded by a fellow commuter, had shocked the conscience of the city. In the clip, he could be seen slowly losing grip of the grab rod, pleading for help.The incident had prompted Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu to set up a high-level committee to identify the problems faced by rail commuters in Mumbai - about 70 lakh people use the city's local train network daily but nothing has significantly changed since then. "The trains at Dadar, Sion, and Kurla during the evening rush hours are always overcrowded. If you want to check your fitness just go to these stations and board a local in evening,” said Samir Zaveri, a railway activist.Zonal Railway Users' Consultative Committee member, Subhash Gupta, said the suburban railway network was on the verge of collapse. "A local train's capacity is around 1,700 people. But during rush hours, it carries around 5,000 people. You can imagine the plight of the commuters. It's a miracle that people don't die of suffocation inside the compartments,” he added.
Pro-West leaders may have been behind Kiev snipers: leaked audio
(TALLINN) - Estonia's top diplomat told EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton in an audio leaked Wednesday about allegations that Ukraine's pro-Western leaders may have had a hand in the February 20-21 bloodbath in Kiev.
"There is now a stronger and stronger understanding (in Kiev) that behind the snipers, it was not (ousted president Viktor) Yanukovych, but it was somebody from the new coalition," Urmas Paet tells Ashton in the audio leaked on YouTube.
Dozens of protesters and around 15 police officers were killed, and parliament impeached Yanukovych the next day.
In the audio of the February 26 call, whose authenticity was confirmed by Estonia, Paet told Ashton he was informed in Kiev that "they were the same snipers killing people from both sides."
Paet, who had had talks with Ukraine's new leaders on February 25, added: "It's really disturbing that now the new coalition, they don't want to investigate what exactly happened."
She responds: "I think we do want to investigate. I mean I didn't know. I didn't pick that up. Gosh."
Paet's spokeswoman Minna-Liina Lind confirmed the audio's authenticity, telling AFP that the minister "regrets very much" that the conversation was leaked.
"We reject the claim that Paet was giving an assessment of the opposition's involvement in the violence," she added.
May 11 project update: Bertha fully beyond Alaskan Way Viaduct
Posted on May 11 2016 3:33 PM
Bertha's passage beneath the Alaskan Way Viaduct has officially come to an end, but Seattle Tunnel Partners has decided to continue mining a bit farther before taking a short break.
By early Wednesday morning, crews had tunneled 385 feet since the underground maintenance stop near Yesler Way. That put them clear of the fourth and final viaduct column the machine had to pass to complete its journey under the elevated structure. STP decided to mine beyond 385 feet in order to reach a better location for the machine to stop while crews take a few days to rest after mining around the clock since April 29.
SR 99 was closed for 10 days while Bertha tunneled beneath the viaduct. WSDOT reopened the highway on Sunday evening based on STP's tunneling progress and the continued stability of the ground and viaduct. Monitoring of the structure and ground will continue throughout the remainder of the tunnel drive.
Look for another progress update next week.

In honor of Survivor, and more importantly Survivor's first season's 14th Anniversary, I'm going to tell you why I think Borneo is some of the best TV ever to exist.
Borneo is made in the realm where it isn't about strategy because strategy isn't existed. In that way, it isn't really Survivor as we know it because the intent of the game and the method it was done by wasn't established yet. Survivor is fascinating because the game rules and mechanics, while aided by production, are all created by the players. Idol splits were envisioned by Cao Boi, flip-flopping was mastered by Rob Cesternino, toppling a power alliance was kickstarted by Neleh, Paschal, Sean, Kathy, and Vecepia, and alliances were eventually created by the Tagi 4. And in this season, we watch as the show has to change upon itself as it runs.
Survivor starts off as a show about people and a show about nature. It's all about watching the people interact on a deserted island, and democratically taking out the weakest link so they can Survive. At 10, they all become one tribe, where the same process continues. We get to see a strong gay man on a tribe with a salty, homophobic old Navy SEAL legend. We have a showmance between two counterculture young adults. People of different races play cards together, and people from different social classes build shelters together. And we're getting a front row seat for perhaps the only time in Survivor of “what will it be like for these sixteen people to have to cooperate to survive on a deserted island, and when they have to remove weak links, who will stand as the strongest?”
Strongest. It's not a strategic mindset, or who can bat their eyelashes the most, or even who can lift the most weight. The Brains/Brawn/Beauty idea wasn't one that was even considered. It was a mindset of being a team player for physical survival or else you'll be voted out for lacking. It's fascinating to watch people like Gervase survive despite voting wrong every single time after B.B., making sexist comments, and being physically weak solely because he was fun and charming. Likewise, it was expected to see Gretchen survive week by week because she was a great team leader who treated everyone with respect and did the most work.
However, it's far more fascinating to see the people react to the Survivor as we know it only halfway through the season. If the show had continued being judged by pre-merge standards throughout the rest of the show, it'd have been great, but not unforgettable. Instead, though, we get to the Final 10, and you have 6 people who are deciding they'll vote however they feel like according to personal terms deciding the most deserving to stay, and you have four people who are deciding to vote together for selfish reasons completely. And just like that, the six others vote for six different people and the other four pile all their votes onto one person: Gretchen Cordy. Out of nowhere, the best ever player of old Survivor was voted out brutally for no reason other than “she was too good at Survivor.”
Then, we see the other contestants react to the new world they've been suddenly thrust into. Kelly of the Tagis has to deal with the guilt of systematically voting good people out, Greg watches with amusement as everything falls apart, Jenna tries too late to scramble a strategy together, Colleen can't believe the game took such an immoral turn, Gervase finally finds himself in an element fit for him all too late, and Sean tries to sneak into the alliance by cheating the system, but doing it so obviously that no one respects him.
Meanwhile, you have Kelly trying to appeal to the personal aspects of the people she's sending to death, Rudy not caring as long as he gets ahead, Sue, who is happy to deceive others to get ahead, and Richard, who just wants to constantly be in control. These four elements embody four bold strategies that are used in Survivor.
Survivor: Borneo is a documentary on how Survivor was created. We saw the world before Survivor, the moment Survivor was created, and how people adapted to Survivor as a new ruler rose into power. You get a sense of every single one of these unique characters and how they're going to live in a shifting world. I believe every single one of the ten who make the merge are top 100 characters of all time in Survivor, and I believe the story, as simple as it seems, is told with so much depth that it is well worth watching. If you haven't watched it, I highly recommend it. It's good TV no matter who you are.

Lawmakers have approved a significant change to driver's license registrations.
If Christie signs the law, approved the Assembly and Senate, New Jersey driver's licenses will now expire every four years, on the driver's birthday, rather than the last day of the month it was issued.
Under current law, a person's driver's license expires on the last day of the 48th month after the license was issued.
Republican Assemblyman Anthony Bucco said that when deadlines are spread across the month, agency offices will more efficiently move people through the system. "This will improve efficiency and increase customer satisfaction," he said
"We can solve the frustrating lines and delays that damage MVC's reputation by eliminating the flood of drivers desperate to get things done before the end of the month," said Bucco, R-Morris

The mere mention of Tumblr leads to exasperated groans from anyone of sound mind. The microblogging site, now owned by Yahoo!, has played host to a myriad of rabid social justice warriors and third-wave feminists for years.
Straight white males are usually the target for the vicious denizens of Tumblr. But one lesser-known Tumblr clique hunts down not men… but expensive free clothes. That's right: Tumblr is also a haven for exhibitionist shoplifters, who have colonised the site.
Many of these self-described “lifters” claim that they're “fighting against capitalism.” They repeat the same, stale idea perpetuated by hippies in the sixties; their lives are made miserable by the great, overwhelming force of “the man.”
Capitalism, they screech, is keeping them down. This corrupt, awful system, which is of course all the fault of “straight white males,” must be destroyed. How? By nicking fancy bras and not paying for lipsticks. I'm not making this up, I promise.
Often, the political systems that Tumblr lifters idolise are based on communism or some variant of anarchism. If you're not sure what anarcho-communism is, just take a look at Russell Brand; he's pretty much the personification of it.
But even communism would be no friend to “lifters.” In a communist society, people are expected to put in the same amount of work as every other citizen and would only be allowed the same amount of goods as others.
Stealing bread in the USSR wasn't tolerated, as thieves were stealing from their comrades. Simply put, if you don't pull your weight, you're not a productive member of society and would probably be sent to the gulags for re-education. If the anarchist section of the left took over, the lifters would be the bitches and lackeys of those with strength and guns.
Moreover, lifters only end up screwing over decent people. Lifters claim that they can steal from multi-million dollar businesses with no consequence – that it's a “victimless crime” – because what's $30 worth of makeup to a billionaire?
Except there are victims here. Two, in fact: the store employee and the honest customer.
Firstly, employees are almost always held accountable for loss of inventory. If the thief isn't caught, the employee responsible in that department is blamed, possibly losing their job as a result. Secondly, the honest customer experiences price hikes by the store that are deployed to cover the cost of stolen items, anti-shoplifting measures, and legal fees.
It's ironic that instead of changing the system like some sort of thieving Nelson Mandela, all lifters do is hurt the little guy, keeping wages down, prices up and the mercantile classes in power. Good job, guys!
Another excuse favoured by lifters is that they're only stealing to survive. Capitalism has made them poor, so it's morally right to keep themselves alive by stealing. If you're a starving child in Africa who needs to steal a bite of bread in order to not die of starvation, that's one thing, but unless lifters are a new sub-species of human that only eat designer clothes and expensive lipstick, that's not what's happening here.
The fact that they have either a smartphone or a computer with which to post their “hauls,” as they call them on Tumblr, only compounds the evidence against them. They aren't poor kids living on skid row. In fact, lifters are usually middle-class, suburban white girls.
When they get caught, lifters often post angry rants on Tumblr about why they shouldn't be punished. Some try and pass it off as “roleplay” or say they were “just joking.” Others claim that because they're underage that they can't be held accountable for their actions.
Bear in mind that these are the same people who whine that just because they're only 15 that doesn't mean that they're not mature enough to make their own life decisions and demand to be treated like an adult. My favourite excuse is this one, where the girl in question claims that she has to shoplift because it helps her beat her cocaine addiction:
When the wider Tumblr ecosystem discovered the lifter community, many called for it to be shut down. Tumblr user tenaflyviper compiled a masterpost of around 400 lifting blogs, which many other users then proceeded to report. Given that the Tumblr community rules clearly state that “illegal behaviour” is banned on the site, lifting blogs are at least skirting on the edge of terms of service violations.
But this is Tumblr: a site which hosts blog dedicated to calling for the death of men and white people.
Tumblr staff have refused to delete or reprimand any lifters, citing their freedom of expression. There are two problems with this. Firstly, lifting blogs often swap tips back and forth as to how to improve their thieving skills. Under the First Amendment, incitement to commit a crime is not protected speech.
Secondly, any blog that goes against the grain of the SJW mentality is shadowbanned by Tumblr Staff. This means that their blogs don't show up in public searches and they cannot answer messages privately, among other punishments, with CommunismKills being a notable example.
Tumblr's “freedom of expression” excuse is paper-thin. Does Yahoo! place a higher priority on protecting the feelings of these misguided young social justice warriors than on protecting the property of innocent business owners?
The UFC's return to Brazil now is official for May, along with a pair of newly booked fights.
“UFC on FX: Belfort vs. Rockhold” is set for May 18 at Arena Jaragua, which is located in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. UFC officials on Tuesday made a formal announcement of the card and its current lineup of fights.
The main card of UFC on FX 8, featuring a middleweight bout between Brazilian favorite Vitor Belfort (22-10 MMA, 11-6 UFC) and final Strikeforce 185-pound champ Luke Rockhold (10-1 MMA, 0-0 UFC), airs on FX following prelims on FUEL TV and Facebook.
In addition to a slate of previously reported bouts for the card, the UFC announced bouts between lightweights Mike Rio (9-1 MMA, 1-0 UFC) and Francisco Trinaldo (12-2 MMA, 2-1 UFC) and light heavyweights Roger Hollett (13-4 MMA, 0-1 UFC) and Fabio Maldonado (18-6 MMA, 1-3 UFC).
Rio, a cast member on “The Ultimate Fighter Live” a year ago, returns for his second official UFC fights after a submission win over John Cofer at the TUF 16 Finale in December. That win gave him three straight, not counting his unofficial fights on “TUF.” He was injured on the show and couldn't compete on Season 15's live finale, delaying his official debut with the promotion to December.
Trinaldo, a cast member of the first international “TUF” season in Brazil, looks for his second straight. All three of his UFC fights have been in his home country of Brazil, including a second-round submission of C.J. Keith in January at UFC on FX 7, giving him six wins in his past seven fights.
Hollett will try to get back on track after dropping his UFC debut this past September in Toronto to Matt Hamill at UFC 152. Hamill was returning from retirement and picked up a unanimous decision, snapping the Canadian's five-fight win streak.
Maldonado is likely in a must-win situation. With three straight losses, the Brazilian will get one more shot. But a loss is likely to send him packing, especially with UFC President Dana White's recent revelation that the promotion still needed to trim its roster by roughly 100 fighters this year. Maldonado won his UFC debut in October 2010, but since has dropped unanimous decisions to Kyle Kingsbury and Igor Pokrajac, then a doctor's stoppage TKO loss to Glover Teixeira at UFC 153 in October. He was praised in that fight, however, for his ability to withstand what was a fairly brutal beating for 10 minutes before the stoppage.
The latest UFC on FX 8 card includes:
Vitor Belfort vs. Luke Rockhold
Constantinos Philippou vs. Ronaldo Souza
Rafael dos Anjos vs. Evan Dunham
CB Dollaway vs. Cezar Ferreira
Lance Benoist vs. Paulo Thiago
Azamat Gashimov vs. John Lineker
Mike Rio vs. Francisco Trinaldo
Roger Hollett vs. Fabio Maldonado

Iowa Cubs
The Iowa Cubs lost to the Sacramento River Cats (Athletics), 6-4.
Kyle Hendricks's second Iowa start was not quite as good as his first one, but there were some positives. Hendricks allowed four runs on eight hits over five innings. The positive was that he struck out seven, but he also walked an uncharacteristically high three batters.
Alberto Cabrera allowed two runs in the top of the eighth to take the loss. Cabrera threw two innings total, allowing four hits. He struck out three and walked three, one intentionally.
Second baseman Edgar Gonzalez was 2 for 5 with an RBI. DH Dave Sappelt was 2 for 4 and scored once. Catcher Chad Noble went 2 for 4 with one run scored and one batted in.
First baseman Josh Vitters was 1 for 3 with a double, but he exited for a pinch-runner after going to third after the double.
Tennessee Smokies
The Tennessee Smokies blinded the Chattanooga Lookouts (Dodgers), 4-1.
Eduardo Figueroa was sharp in getting his second win and first with the Smokies. Figuera tossed five scoreless innings, allowing six hits. He walked one and struck out one.
The Smokies put this game away with three runs in the seventh inning on an RBI single by second baseman Arismendy Alcantara and a two-run single by right fielder Rubi Silva. Both hitters were 1 for 4 and Alcantara scored on Silva's single.
Third baseman Christian Villanueva was 2 for 3 with a double and a walk. He scored one run. Center fielder Matthew Szczur went 2 for 3 with a walk and a run scored.
The win extends Tennessee's lead over second-place Birmingham to 4.5 games. However, since Birmingham won the first half title, their lead for the second playoff spot is actually 6 games over Jackson. If Birmingham wins both halves, the second playoff spot goes to the team with the second-best overall record. In that case, Tennessee has a 9.5 game lead over Jackson.
Daytona Cubs
The Daytona Cubs split a doubleheader with the Clearwater Threshers (Phillies), winning game one 5-0 and dropping the second one 3-2.
In the first game, starter Pierce Johnson improved his record in Daytona to 5-1 after he threw 5.2 scoreless innings, He allowed four hits and issued three walks. He struck out seven Threshers.
Armando Rivero got his first Daytona save and second overall save by pitching the rest of the way. Over his 1.1 innings, Rivera allowed one hit. He struck out one and did not walk anyone.
In his second at-bat for Daytona, DH Daniel Vogelbach crushed a two-run home run to center field. It was Vogelbach's 18th home run overall. Vogelbach was 2 for 3 and scored twice.
Left fielder Anthony Giansanti was 2 for 3 with one run batted in.
In the second game, starter Yao-Lin Wang pitched really well, but was the victim of non-support and his record fell to 3-4. Wang allowed two runs on four hits, including one solo home run, over 5.1 innings. What was impressive was that he struck out eight and didn't walk anyone.
In his second at-bat for Daytona, third baseman Kris Bryant hit a solo home run to center field. Yes, both Vogelbach and Bryant homered in their second at bats for the D-Cubs. (Bryant didn't arrive in time to play game one.) Bryant was 1 for 3.
Second baseman Wes Darvill was 2 for 3 and scored Daytona's other run in the second game.
Second-place Lakeland was swept in a double-header by Dunedin, so Daytona's lead in the North division was extended to 4.5 games.
Kane County Cougars
Off-day. Traveling to Burlington for a game tomorrow night. Trevor Gretzky was promoted to Kane County from Boise.
Boise Hawks
The Boise Hawks shattered the Eugene Emeralds (Padres), 12-1.
Starter Duane Underwood allowed a run in the top of the first inning, but everything after that was all Hawks. Underwood allowed one run on three hits over three innings. He walked one and did not have a strikeout.
Paul Blackburn piggybacked Underwood and got the win because Underwood didn't go five innings. Blackburn tossed three scoreless innings, allowing four hits. He walked one and struck out one.
Trey Masek had two scoreless innings of relief and Eddie Orozco pitched a scoreless ninth.
Right fielder Yasiel Balaguert put Boise on top for good in the bottom of the first inning with a three-run home run, his seventh this season. Balaguert also doubled in a 2 for 3 night. He also walked twice and scored three times.
Left fielder David Bote was 3 for 4 with two doubles and a walk. Bote had four total RBIs and scored twice. He also stole a base.
Second baseman Danny Lockhart was 2 for 5 and scored once. First baseman Jacob Rogers went 2 for 2 with three walks. Rogers scored twice.
Third baseman Jordan Hankins made sure the Hawks didn't miss Kris Bryant tonight by going 3 for 5 with a double. He scored once and had one RBI.
AZL Cubs
Off-day
Melbourne managed to turn a 19 point half time deficit in to a six point lead in their second round AFLW match against Collingwood at Princes Park tonight.
The player that did the most damage, Cat Phillips, is an ultimate frisbee champion who first picked up a footy at the age of 24.
Before that, she'd captained the first non-North American team to ever win the ultimate frisbee US Open, taking the Melbourne Ellipsis to a win over Seattle Mixtape.
Despite her lack of experience, Phillips looked an absolute natural when she picked up her first goal from the impossible angle on the boundary — an early front runner for goal of the season:
Karen Paxman then kicked a goal 30 seconds later:
Before Phillips' athleticism and running skills saw her level scores within a couple of minutes:
Goals to Alyssa Mifsud and Shelley Scott have put Melbourne 12 points up with 10 minutes to play, with the Dees eyeing off a remarkable come from behind win.
For fans of the Halloween franchise the likelihood of ever seeing a complete series box set in the United States seemed like a pipe dream until Scream Factory and Anchor Bay joined forces. What they've managed to produce is one of the most comprehensive sets the Blu-ray format has ever seen.
Each title in the set merits its own review, and continuing the series, today we're looking at the series' return to its roots with Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers.
Part one of the series can be found here, part two here, and part three.
The Movie Itself (3.5/5)
After a single film hiatus, Michael Myers and Doctor Loomis have returned for the fourth installment of the Halloween franchise with some quick hand waving about how they both survived the explosion at the end of Halloween II. It's now 1988, and a scarred Loomis wards over a comatose Michael to ensure he doesn't wreak havoc again, until the order comes to have Michael transferred to a new facility. Of course, Michael escapes and makes a beeline back to Haddonfield, the town finally healing after his rampage a decade earlier.
Loomis, ever the Captain Ahab to Michael Myers' Moby Dick, is soon after him and the chase continues. Laurie Strode isn't with us in this timeline anymore, having been killed in a car accident, but she left behind a daughter, young Jamie, who becomes Michael's new target. I have to stop at this point and ask what Michael's endgame would be had he actually killed Laurie OR Jamie in any of the films? Would he stop? Is he just content to try and end his own bloodline? We'll never really know…anyway, I digress.
For all intents and purposes we're watching a remake of the first film, which after having to endure the third installment is a welcome blessing. The series has again evolved from its original, opting for more gore and violent kills akin to Halloween II instead of the suspenseful torment John Carpenter's Halloween had to offer. Halloween 4 works on all the levels it's supposed to, but never tries to be anything it isn't. Donald Pleasence again nails Sam Loomis, a man who's given his entire life to try and stop Myers' rampages, and constantly fails. He brings a sense of powerlessness to the role this time, partially from being disfigured and partially from actually knowing every attempt at stopping Myers he makes is futile. It's probably best summed up in an early scene where Loomis stops for gas and finds the grisly aftermath of a visit from Michael. Gun drawn, Loomis walks into the diner portion casually, until he sees his target in the kitchen and attempts to offer himself as a victim in exchange for the citizens of Haddonfield before painfully decreeing “God damn you!” while shooting at him.
Halloween 4 can't be discussed without mentioning Danielle Harris' Jamie, who quickly becomes the series fourth iconic character. It's rare that a child actor in a horror film can be empathized with because they're usually so poorly portrayed that you hope the killer gets them, but Harris gives a vulnerable charm to Jamie that makes you want to hug and protect her from the Boogeyman.
Visuals/Picture Quality (3/5)
Sans the first installment, it seems like none of the subsequent films have had any restoration work on the transfers. That being said, Halloween 4 is watchable, and the presentation on the Blu-ray is obviously superior to the DVD, however it lacks the “pop” the format is truly capable of. The image is a little washed out, but no compression artifacts or aliasing was present. It won't win any awards and the transfer is about as mid-range as you can get.
Score/Audio Quality (3/5)
The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 is a little loud at times, drowning out dialogue and punishing my subwoofer a bit unnecessarily. Keep the remote handy, because you're going to keep having to adjust the volume on this release. We do get our iconic John Carpenter piano them back this time around, however, so there's still much to be happy about.
Special Features (3/5)
Surprisingly, Halloween 4 is lacking in the special features department. We've got two commentary tracks, one with Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris that discusses the film, the franchise, and production insight. It's an enjoyable commentary and one I'll probably listen to again. The second commentary is with director Dwight Little and author Justin Beahm and it's a little more technically, going into casting and solid behind the scenes anecdotes.
Aside from the trailer, that's it. I feel like Scream! Factory missed an opportunity with this release, given the vast amount of supplemental material from the previous entries in the boxed set.
Packaging (3/5)
Standard single disc eco case, black.
Since this is part of a larger boxed set, images of the film being reviewed will be provided, and the final installment will give an overall packaging review.

Overall (3/5)
What we've got here is almost a total reversal of what Halloween III: Season of the Witch had to offer; a poor film with a nice supplemental package. Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers is a solid film with hardly any attention paid to it on the back end. For a comprehensive boxed set it does weaken the package a bit, but some extras are better than none I suppose. As per usual, you can find this in the 10 Disc Complete Collection or the Limited Deluxe Edition, which appears to have gone out of print as of this writing, but can still be acquired reasonably.
Earlier last week, I had the privilege of attending Disney Infinity's Toybox Summit at Disneyland Resort! While the experience overall was excellent, I'll refrain from making this a “trip recap” post and instead focus on the information in one of the great panels that took place at the Summit: some new Toybox features for Disney Infinity 3.0
Disney Infinity 3.0's New Toys
The Path Creator
The talk of the town among the Toybox Artists and mentors was the brand new Path Creator Creativitoy. This tool allows you to place down a path in your Toybox, then connect it to anything from a townsperson to a vehicle to a camera. This results in the connected toy following along the path automatically once it's set, which opens up some very rich possibilities with Toybox building. With this toy, you can now set vehicles and characters to move around your worlds, making the environment seem much more alive. Additionally, if you like creating amusement parks in your game, you can now build rollercoasters and rotating blocks! It's no wonder this was many of the artists' favorite new tool.
Other New Toys
The Lock and Key toys look promising; you can now make it so that you need a literal key to unlock the next part of your game. This key is hefty, though. In order for the characters to carry it they'll need to use two hands!
Dynamic Trigger
Trigger Areas have always been one of the most useful Creativitoys in the game, but in 2.0 they were static: they could only be placed in one place. The new Dynamic Trigger allows you to create a triggered area around a Locator, a Townsperson, or another character. The Dynamic Trigger will stay linked to them indefinitely, so even if they wander around the world your connections will not be lost. This opens up immeasurable possibilities, as you can now create “moving targets;” you can now create games of tag and hide and seek in the Toybox!
Other New Creativitoys
You can now add Boss Battles to your Toyboxes! This Creativitoy will come loaded with preset bosses, however, which includes the usual roster of baddies: Darth Maul, Vader, and General Grievous. Perhaps more have been unannounced, but this remains an exciting addition to the game.
Calendar Configurator
If you're a big fan of real-life games that offer unique experiences depending on the time, the day, or the month, then you'll love this next new toy. The Calendar Configurator allows you to make Toyboxes that change with the passing of time. With this new toy, you can set it so that the Skydome is bright during the day hours, but dark during the night. You can set it so that if you play the Toybox during the real-life month of December there is snow everywhere! You can set it so that if you play in this Toybox consistently for a week, something different will happen each new day! This toy adds some replay value to Toyboxes that didn't exist in any previous versions. Brilliant.
Improvements
In addition to all the wonderful new toys being added, many of the best toys from the previous games received some much-needed upgrades.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Seven militants who killed 20 people at a Dhaka restaurant made no demands and a person taken alive by police was only a suspect admitted in hospital, Bangladesh's home minister said on Sunday, rejecting Islamic State's claims of responsibility.
The gunmen stormed the upmarket restaurant in the diplomatic zone late on Friday and killed their mostly non-Muslim hostages, including nine Italians, seven Japanese and a citizen each from the United States and India.
Three of the six gunmen killed were under 22 years of age and had been missing for six months, Asaduzzaman Khan told Reuters in an interview at his Dhaka home.
Police and government officials have said the attackers were from well-off Bangladeshi families, a rarity and an indication that religious radicalisation was widening its scope.
Claiming responsibility, Islamic State warned citizens of “crusader countries” - that is, traditionally Christian western states - in a statement that they would not be safe “as long as their aircraft are killing Muslims”.
It also posted pictures of five grinning fighters in front of a black flag who it said were involved in the attack, according to the SITE monitoring website.
But Khan said Islamic State was not involved, reiterating the government's position that home-grown militants were responsible for a spate of killings in the country over the past 18 months, including the latest one.
Asked about the photos, the minister pointed to a wall behind him and said: “If I fix a poster of IS here and stand with a machine gun, will it establish that IS is here?”
The minister has blamed Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh, which claims to represent Islamic State in Bangladesh but has no proven links to it.
Security experts believe the suspect, who was hospitalised with serious injuries, would be crucial to the investigation into the attack. Khan said it was not clear if he was involved.
Islamic State also claimed responsibility for two bombings overnight in Baghdad that killed nearly 120 people and wounded 200, most of them in a busy shopping area while residents celebrated the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
Reacting to the two attacks over the past three days, Pope Francis asked people attending noon prayer at the Vatican in Rome to pray for the victims and their families.
Late on Sunday in Bangladesh, hundreds of men, women and children held a candlelight vigil near Dhaka's Shaheed Minar (Martyr's Monument) to pay respect to those who lost their lives.
“We don't want this,” Nasima, a textile industry worker, told Reuters Television. “Please stop this, stop this, stop this from our society, from our country, I want to live in peace.”
As Dhaka limped back to normal life, experts questioned the delay in launching the offensive against the militants. More than 100 commandos stormed the restaurant nearly 10 hours after the siege began, under an operation code-named ‘Thunderbolt'.
Analysts say that as Islamic State loses territory in Iraq and Syria and its finances get drained, it may be trying to build affiliates in countries such as Bangladesh for jihadists to launch attacks locally and cheaply.
RICH FAMILIES
Deputy Inspector General of Police Shahidur Rahman said on Sunday that authorities were investigating any connection between the attackers and transnational groups such as Islamic State or al Qaeda.
He said the militants were mostly educated and from well-off families, but declined to give any more details. On Saturday police released pictures of five dead militants, most of them wearing grey T-shirts.
National police chief Shahidul Hoque said all the gunmen were Bangladeshis. “Five of them were listed as militants and law enforcers made several drives to arrest them,” he said.
Whoever was responsible, the attack marked a major escalation in violence by militants demanding Islamic rule in Bangladesh, whose 160 million people are mostly Muslim.
Previous attacks have mostly singled out individuals advocating a secular or liberal lifestyle, or religious minorities.
RECITING KORAN VERSE
Friday night's attack, during the final days of Ramadan, was more coordinated than the previous assaults.
Gunmen singled out foreigners as soon as they stormed through the doors of the restaurant popular with expatriates. They ordered all Bangladeshis to stand up before the killing began, a source briefed on the investigation said.
The Bangladeshis were later told to close their eyes and recite verses from the Koran. One militant cursed a Bangladeshi for eating with non-Muslims during Ramadan, the source said.

The Islamic State-affiliated Amaq news agency claimed in a report on Saturday that the militants identified and released Muslim patrons from the Dhaka restaurant, SITE said.
The victims also included at least three Bangladeshis or people of Bangladeshi descent.
The militants hacked most of their victims with machetes, leaving their bleeding bodies on the floor.
A standoff of nearly 12 hours with security forces ended when the commandos stormed the building, killing six of the militants and capturing a seventh after attempts at negotiations proved fruitless, authorities said. They recovered explosives and sharp weapons from the scene.
HOME-GROWN GROUPS
Up until Friday's attack, authorities had maintained no operational links existed between Bangladeshi militants and international jihadi networks. Bangladesh has blamed JMB and another home-grown outfit for the wave of grisly killings over the past year and a half.
One line of inquiry being pursued was whether the restaurant attackers received any guidance from Islamic State or al Qaeda, an official in Bangladesh's counter-terrorism wing said.
“Pictures (uploaded on Twitter) indicate they might have been encouraged by ISIS (Islamic State) activities abroad,” said Muhammad Zamir, a former senior foreign ministry official.
“But this does not show a direct link to ISIS. This is exactly what was done and disputed later in the case of the Orlando attack,” he said, referring to the killing of 49 people last month by a man who pledged allegiance to Islamic State.
Friday's attack in Dhaka was the worst since 2005, when JMB set off a series of bombs throughout Bangladesh in the space of an hour that killed at least 25 people, mostly judges, police and journalists.
The authorities executed six top JMB leaders in March 2007 and police have continued to hunt for group members, often detaining suspected militants following intelligence tips.
In February, Bangladesh police arrested three JMB members suspected of killing a Hindu priest.
Islamic state has claimed responsibility for a series of other attacks in Bangladesh in recent months since first taking credit for a killing in September last year.
An Italian missionary was shot and wounded in the neck last November. Another Italian and a Japanese citizen were killed in attacks at the end of September and early October last year.
“Why will IS come here ... they are now in Iraq, Syria and sometimes in their neighbouring country they enter,” minister Khan said. “We have no border with them. Why they will come here and how they will come here?”
“SAVE ME, SAVE ME”
In a run-down government hospital in Dhaka, two police officers who were on patrol duty on Friday night were treated for gunshot wounds, with bandages and plasters on their cheeks and legs. Behind their beds, a sheet of paper carried details of their wounds.
Struggling to speak, 30-year-old officer Pradip, who gave just one name, recalled rushing to the spot after receiving a message that night. A blood-smeared man lay in front of the restaurant, shouting “save me, save me”.
The police officers called for backup after they were shot at from inside the restaurant.
“At some point, I felt blood was rolling down my cheek,” Pradip said. “We did respond with fire and the attackers stopped. We then rescued the man, who was the driver of some of the Japanese citizens who were inside.”
After meeting the officers in the hospital, police chief Hoque told Reuters they had gleaned some preliminary details on the identities of the attackers, but gave no details.
GARMENT INDUSTRY
The seven Japanese killed were working on projects for the Japan International Cooperation Agency, an overseas aid agency, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Saturday.
Six of them were in Dhaka to work on a metro rail project, said Bangladesh's communication minister Obaidul Quader.
Italian media said several of the Italians victims worked in Bangladesh's $26 billion garment sector, which accounts for 80 percent of the country's exports.
Minister Khan said he did not believe the attack would have any impact on the garment industry or the country's economy.

But some disagree. A Bangladeshi garment exporter who supplies six European countries said his customers generally visit every two months but will now rethink that.
“I feel they will be afraid,” he said, declining to be identified. “Even I am afraid.”
We both got to check out End of Nations earlier today. It's being billed as a massively multiplayer online real-time strategy game. First off: Did you come away thinking that developer Petroglyph can really make that work?Well, yes and no. I mean, the game looks great, and from the PR spiel we heard, it seems like everything should be a lot of fun. But we didn't actually play it at all, so, yeah. That said, it seems like the Petroglyph guys have really done their homework; the fact that they dropped names like World in Conflict and Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II throughout the demo tells me that they at least have the right ideas in mind. Just how and with what tools they're going to convert this RTS experience into an MMO remains to be seen -- but, again, from what we saw, I'd say things look pretty promising for this title.What did you think about the team aspect of the game? Each player is hardcapped to 20 unit slots, with some units taking up multiple slots. That's some serious quality-over-quantity design going on. And the lack of dirt-farming (i.e., securing resources from captured control points instead of gold/farm/wood/whatever nodes) should make for a more action-packed game, a la the aforementioned World in Conflict and Dawn of War II. Anyway, I'm babbling... I think I had a question in here somewhere.Yeah, I thought the whole "bigger units take up more slots" thing was a really cool idea -- and it forces you to be very careful about what loadout you decide to take into combat. But that's sort of similar to any major MMO, right? You choose what gear and powers to equip for a given instance, and you make that decision in light of what your teammates are also doing. I really liked how they described the "rock, paper, scissors" element of End of Nations' combat: Some guys will try to build a balanced squad, but others will go tank-heavy or air-heavy, and rely on their teammates to pick up the slack.And yes, the control-point resource gathering is vastly superior for this kind of game -- especially because the game also allows you to earn and deploy defensive structures. The game's got no real base-building aspect per se, but you can use deployable turrets (of which you're allotted a limited number) to help hold critical control structures, and that gives End of Nations at least a hint of the more traditional RTS model, without needing to resort to that whole base-building/upgrading/research malarkey.I'm a little bit leery of the MMO stuff; they talked about 26-on-26 maps, which just sounds absolutely insane. And a level-differentiated matchmaking system is always going to be broken on some level. Do you think they can really pull off a true persistent RTS that values individual player skill over "you're level 10 and I'm level 5, so therefore I win" nonsense?I remember balking at the 26-on-26 thing too -- is that really possible, just to render on a local computer, for instance? The developer told us that they'd been "doing a lot of work on the backend" to make the graphics all slick and fast, but I can't believe a 52-player game would be smooth unless everyone was using a Cray supercomputer and connected via some kind of Bat-computer-speed Internet connection. The leveling thing, I guess, is going to be balanced in the matchmaking system and via team-building. If you have 10 guys on a team, as long as they're more-or-less the same aggregate level as the 10 other guys, I guess you're good. Again, though, I'm not sure how they're going to integrate the MMO aspect; they talked about clans and customization, and earnable upgrades and loot, but with an RTS, the absolute key is unit balance across factions and sides. If one guy is just a better player and able to tech up faster and get better units, that's one thing. But if he comes into the game with a vastly better arsenal from the get-go -- how is that going to work in a traditional RTS regime? I gotta confess: I don't know... but the dev seemed to know what he was talking about, so I'm hopeful.Well, what are we gonna call our awesome ass-kicking guild or clan or whatever when it comes out? I was thinking "Fat Smelly Jort-Wearing Woman-Deficient Manbabies." Because hey, that's us.Hey, great question there Ryan, that's definitely going to get me to tell people more about the experience. Here, how about I just finish this article on my own? Hey Eric? Yes, Eric? Hey man, so, does End of Nations only have player-versus-player combat, or does it have a co-op mode as well? Why yes, Eric, ithave a co-op mode, where you and up to 50 friends (yes, 50, according to the developers) can face off against an equal number of CPUs and wreak all sorts of virtual havoc. Cool, Eric, that's cool -- say, what about the setting, when is the game set? Well, good question, Eric. The game is set approximately 50 years in the future, so you get some realistic units, but upgraded with what the designers think are equally realistic sci-fi weaponry, such as hover-tanks and rail guns.In all, End of Nations is nothing if not ambitious -- trying to blend two of the PC's staple genres together makes sense on paper. Whether or not it can actually fly once it's on the runway, though, is the real question.
Note to Thor: My friend sent you a photo of my passport three times to your gmail. If you did not receive, provide another email because China has been at war with Google for 5 years already.
PART 1: Please do not ask me questions, since I cannot provide details that would cause serious problems for Julian. I will tell you the following which are all facts that can be confirmed through public court records. Even though my family and I have been threatened, I was moved to comment here because of the situation of Kurt Soonefeld brought up in another Reddit thread. My ex wife is from Guayaquil, Ecuador Her name is MP and my daughter's name is Nicki. My current wife of 16 years is a Canadian citizen. I tell you this only so people will know I am the real Bruce_Gorcyca. In the past other people trying to smear me have posted crap on the internet using my name and even my photo as an avatar!
I am forcibly exiled in China due to a possible double cross in which a Canadian government official told me too much heat was being exerted on them by Uncle Sam when I returned to Canada after Senior Federal Judge Weinstein dismissed my phony stock fraud charges on December 17th, 2007 in a Brooklyn federal court hearing where I defended myself that lasted 2 hours. At that hearing the prosecutor told me that "If you plead guilty to something, you can go home tomorrow". The last time I plead guilty to a crime I did not commit, I got fucked. So I said "No thank you and explained my situation and my 20 year whistle blowing history to Judge Weinstein. After he dismissed my charges he told me I was free to rejoin my family in Canada and I did so.
But Uncle Sam was not happy with me being out of their control and pressured Canada to lean on me. The Canadian official I trusted admitted that the pressure was intense to deport me for any reason. But there was no legal reason to deport me since my wife and kids are Canadian citizens and I entered Canada legally. Still I was told that even if the deportation was illegal it would take me years to fight it in court, and If I wanted to stay in Canada he suggested a solution that my immigration lawyer Marshal Drukarsh said would work... They said that if I made a "voluntary departure" I could return after 3 or 6 months "when the heat was off" and everything would be fine. I believed Marshal's judgement on this which was also confirmed by MP Omar Alghabra who wrote me a letter to this effect. At the time MP Alghabra was the Head of Immigration Commission Committee in Parliament, so I had no reason to doubt him.
However, after I arrived to Beijing and worked for a few months I waited 90 days and went to buy a plane ticket home to Toronto. At this point I git the shock of my life when a manager at Air Canada told me they were not allowed to sellme a ticket. When I asked "why" they hesitated and then told me that I was on the "no fly list". Uncles Sam arranged for this ruse no doubt. I tried again after another 3 months and got the same result. I have not seen my wife and kids since they visited me in China in 2011. My youngest son is six years old and autistic. My eldest son is 16 and a musical prodigy with staright As in school. My entire situation is explained at hhtp://whyunclesamhatesbruce.blogspot.ca. I have have concluded that the government criminals I have knowledge about in North America (Jeb Bush, Dick Cheney, Hillary Clinton, Hugh Rodham, Stephen Harper, and almost 80 U.S. officials with Panama bank accounts, are determined to keep me in China until I die so I cannot testify in any North American court or before Congress about massive money laundering on Wall Street, Enron insider trading, the murders of FBI informant Al Chalem, Cliff Baxter, Ken Lay, John Wheeler, 911 insider trading, etc.
When I was jailed in 2007 (pre-trial detention they call it) in Brooklyn awaiting a trial on the phony stock fraud charges, I met a young Indian man who became friends with me. We played chess together everyday and after two weeks he confided that he worked for the City of New York as did his girlfriend. He swore to me that three weeks before 911, Rudy Guiliani personally told him to find an arrangement ships to haul away roughly 500,000 tons of steal for recycling in India and the ships would only be allowed 10 days in port. The ship would have to arrive on or about September 10 and leave as soon as possible. He was not given more details but he made the arrangements not only for the ships but for the recycler in India. In the process he realized there were recycling companies right next door in New Jersey that would pay a higher price per ton, and by eliminating the transportation cost the city would make a bigger profit by alsmost 40%. He said when he told this to Guiliani, the Mayor was angry instead of pleased, and told this Indian "Just do as you are told". So he did. About a week after 911 some reporter from Nightline got a hold of the Indian and wasasking details about the shipping arrangements. Two days later the Indian guy and his girlfreind were both arrested by the FBI on fake "accounting fraud" charges!!! They made him a deal that if he pleads guilty he would get a 10 year sentence and charges against his girlfreind would be dropped. If he did not take the deal he and his grilfriend would both get 15 year sentences. I told him about my IRS episode and urged him to fight it with a good lawyer and go tell that Nightline reporter the full story. I never saw him again because the next day, Judge Weinstein released me from custody. I kept this guys name along with other sensitive material back in Canada buried in a PCV pipe in a very large wooded area.
Now about Julian... I never thought about going to Julian based only with what I knew because there were two many loose ends. What I had alone could connect about 80% but not 100% of the dots, except in the Jeb Bush/Terry Nelson drug smuggling ring where 99% of the jigsaw puzzle fit perfectly. Yes I was an executive at American Financial Group, and yes I was an FBI informant at AFG. (my handler MB is identified in many court documents and in the famous PDC letter found at this link: Now about Julian... I never thought about going to Julian based only with what I knew because there were two many loose ends. What I had alone could connect about 80% but not 100% of the dots, except in the Jeb Bush/Terry Nelson drug smuggling ring where 99% of the jigsaw puzzle fit perfectly. Yes I was an executive at American Financial Group, and yes I was an FBI informant at AFG. (my handler MB is identified in many court documents and in the famous PDC letter found at this link: http://www.opnlttr.com/letter/dear-congressional-oversight-committee-stop-ignoring-elephant-room-911-saudis-hillary-clinton . Yes, I still have the AFG phone records with calls made to 202-456-33445, Kennebunkport, Silver Springs and Falls Church (personal residences of government officials) and client files, and over 3 dozen recordings of my calls with government officials. I started taping them after I realized all of their verbal promises were never put into writing, not in a proffer, not in a plea agreement, not even a email. My lawyers even mention this on the court record in Canada (Case no. C-37836 in Ontario Court of Appeals). I even submitted some of the recordings to the court as "fresh evidence" but they were ordered removed by Justice Goudge without any explanation.
But after I had a lucky meeting with a Vietnam war buddy of John Wheeler on The Great Wall of China, I discovered that Wheeler also knew a great deal about Enron, 911, Wall Street frauds, and even about a missing nuclear warhead. At first I though this guy was whacko but he offered to put me in touch with Wheeler. We arranged the call to be received by Wheeler at a hotel room at prearanged time and date. Since my mobile phone and email in China has been blocked from international calls (compliments of NSA) we had to get creative. Our first call was awkward but enlightening and I knew immediately John was the real deal after I confirmed he worked for the SEC for 8 years as their top gun investigator for insider trading and he even knew about the bank accounts at Morgan & Morgan. In total we talked on several calls for maybe 6-8 hours and John agreed to come visit me in China the first half of January for a few days and bring me an encrypted satellite phone and a reporter friend of his named "MH" who he had been cinfiding in about 911 and the missing warhead, the latter of which I know absolutely nothing about.
When John did not show up for the Beijing meeting and I could not reach our mutual friend. I grew alarmed and realized something was wrong. When I learned of his grizzly murder and recalled the threats that both John and I had received. I decided to lie low and watch my back. Not long after someone burglarized my Beijing apartment and stole only my laptop, no cash or jewelry. Since my book manuscripts were seized by the FBI frommy mother's house, I learned to keep everything backed up on USBs secreted far away from my residence and work loactions, and safeguarded with multiple friends in different countries.
One of these friends in Italy had his Skype mysteriously blocked (as is my own to North America) and when we could not communicate he freaked out assumed I met the same fate as Wheeler and he started leaking chapters of my old book on a website called worldlawdirect.com under the user name of "Nico" When I realized he was doing this a few weeks later I sent him a PM to stop and assured him I was okay, but he did not believe I was the real Bruce Gorcyca and leaked the three chapters about the Clintons (I had brief dealings with both Hillary and Bill in 2001 and 1997 respectively). That is when hackers were turned loose on the website, and as quick as the posts were corrupted or deleted, Nico would replace them! Finally a fake lawsuit was filed against the worldlawdirect.com website and a judge ordered that the web site be shut down in August of 2016. But some hackers from Anonymous restored the site sometime in the first half of October but by the end of the month it was down again. They reopened the site with a .eu domain but they removed the forum where Nico had posted the chapters of my book.
Washington DC – -(Ammoland.com)- When former Gov. and current Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) changed positions on the assault weapons ban post-Connecticut school shooting, he justified the change by saying, “I don't know anyone that needs 30 rounds in a clip to go hunting.”
He also said that he doesn't know “anyone in the sporting or hunting arena that goes out with an assault rifle.”
Shortly after these statements, pictures of then-Gov. Manchin shooting an AR-15 with a 15 to 20 round clips, red dot sight, flashlight, and a collapsible stock were sent to Breitbart News.
They're good pictures. The problem is, they're pictures of hypocrite — pictures of yet another politician who's rule appears to be “do as I say, not as I do.”
Here are some other quick points:
Firstly, Manchin makes a massive error in judging guns and gun-accessories based on their relation to hunting. Our Founding Fathers did not seek to protect the right to keep and bear arms so we could hunt. Rather, they put the 2nd Amendment in place to shield our right to have and use firearms so we could defend our lives and our property, and so we could repel a tyranny. To reduce 2nd Amendment rights to hunting purposes is as dangerous as it is baseless.
Secondly, as I said during a guest spot on America's Radio News Network on Monday, a 30 round clip is actually a very viable clip for home defense. To understand this, just imagine three armed men kicking in the front door of your house while you're eating dinner with your family. All three are armed with guns that hold 7 to 10 rounds apiece, so you're up against 21 to 30 rounds. At that point, which clip do you want in your AR-15? A 10 round, a 20, or a 30?
This isn't rocket science, it's freedom.

Hi there! I am Wouter, a game designer from The Netherlands. Last year I talked about my pirate game Wacky Pirates on Analog Games. Since I received quite a good response on that story, I would now like to show you how my third game came about: Sunflower Valley .
Doodle City, published by 999 Games.
When I heard about the dice game ‘Doodle City' somewhere in 2015, I immediately became excited because of its title. Just imagine: a game in which you draw your own city! But frankly, I was a little disappointed when I actually played the game. In this pen-and-paper game you draw lines through city streets to score points. On a grid, players try to cleverly link their roads by making use of the dice. Don't get me wrong; the game is pure fun. But I missed the game element of ‘doodling' your own world, which I had hoped for because of the title… This sparked my idea of creating a world-builder in which you truly doodle your own little world.
The Dice Card in Sunflower Valley.
One thing I love in Doodle City is the dice-drafting mechanism in which players compete over a pool of dice—everyone gets to choose just one die. I really wanted to implement this element in my game, because it works so well in building up tension during the game. Something I wanted to change, however, was the blue die that determines in which column you have to draw a line. I wanted to increase player options for determining where to draw. This led me to the idea of a Die Card on which you choose a region you will draw in. On the Dice Card, you use your chosen die to occupy an unoccupied color. Then, you draw an icon in a region matching that color. Other than taking dice other people might want, Doodle City felt like a solitary game. The introduction of the Dice Card made the game a bit more interactive, since you can temporarily block a certain colored region for the other players as a strategy.
Early prototype of a doodle world-building dice game.
One of the first versions had a grid-like map as seen in Doodle City. In the different colored regions you could doodle icons matching the die value on your chosen die. You could build villages with chickens in wooded regions. By making the right combos of placement and amount, you could score points at the end of the game. At one point I came up with the idea of adding a puzzle-element. I developed a new rule giving bonus points for connecting your villages using roads. Remembering the rule from Catan where you have to build at least 2 streets between villages, I played with this new element, ending up with a combination of straight and curved roads. It worked well, and the link with Catan also inspired me to change the grid to hexagon tiles, opening up much more freedom to make combos with the icons.
More prototypes with drawings by playtesters.
I was looking for icons that anyone could easily draw. This led me to the idea of using a mountain landscape as a game world. In this mountain valley, you draw villages and sheep, and try to connect villages using railway tracks. In addition, you can cheer up the valley and earn bonus points by drawing sunflowers around the preprinted mountains. Because I wanted to use regular 6-sided dice, the game uses 6 dice in total, so potentially every die value can be available during a round. Since the game features 5 colored regions, the last player can always choose between at least 2 dice.
Lots of scoring opportunities in Sunflower Valley. Photo by Saya Lee.
I wanted to give the game depth by offering several scoring opportunities. After many iterations, in the final version you can score points in the following ways: by providing your villages with sheep; having the most sunflowers of all players in a colored region (interaction element); surrounding your mountains with sunflowers; attracting the most villagers to your valley; and connecting your villages with at least 2 railway tracks.
Box art by Weberson Santiago from Brazil!
I'm a big fan of artwork by Weberson Santiago. He did games like The Bloody Inn , Coup and World Championship Russian Roulette . When he agreed to work on my project I was on the moon!
For a long time, my game with villages and sunflowers in a valley didn't have a name—I always find game titles hard to come up with. Then, someone asked me: “hey, how is your Sunflower Valley game going,” and I knew that this was the perfect title for my game!
Lovely doodle by one of the playtesters.
I'm really happy about how the game turned out. It is always fun to watch how people start with the same empty valley but then come up with a completely unique one. In the rules I encourage players to draw the icons in their Sunflower Valley in any recognizable form they like. I hope that this way people can freely use their creativity and that they have the feeling that they're “doodling” their own little world.
If you're interested in Sunflower Valley, I've produced the game in a very limited print-run, there are still some copies for sale over here . And don't forget to take a picture when you play Sunflower Valley and mail them to me 🙂 Thanks for reading my story and happy gaming!
FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. -- It started as added protection for an unspecified thumb injury. It turned into somewhat of a fashion statement.
Atlanta Falcons MVP candidate Matt Ryan started wearing a glove on his left non-throwing hand after banging his thumb during a 45-32 Week 3 win in New Orleans. It gave him a better grip on the football. He stuck with it the rest of the regular season and will wear a black glove in Saturday's home playoff matchup against Seattle.
Ryan could have ditched the glove a while ago.

"I don't know specifically which week, but probably six or seven weeks after," Ryan said without sharing details about the thumb injury. "Probably Week 10 or 11, I could have."
But he didn't. And maybe it's become a lucky glove, in a sense.
"No, no, not at all, because that glove has changed a lot," Ryan said with a laugh. "I probably change it once a week. I've just gotten used to wearing one. That's it. Every day in practice, you get used to it. You start doing the same thing over and over again."
Because the Falcons obviously change uniforms, Ryan has changed glove colors. Not that any of it really correlates, but Ryan is 6-4 when he wears a black glove and 4-0 in all other colors: 2-0 in white, 1-0 in red, and 1-0 in gray. He wore a black glove with a red jersey when he threw for a franchise-record 503 yards in a 48-33 home win against Carolina. He wore a white glove with a white jersey when he posted a season-best 144.7 passing rating in a 43-28 road win against Tampa Bay. And he wore a black glove with a white jersey when he posted a season-low 78.7 passing rating in a 24-15 loss in Philadelphia.
Wide receiver Julio Jones, doubling as a fashion consultant, assessed which glove color suits Ryan best.
"The black one looks better, because it goes with the uniform," Jones said. "The white, it's just too much. It kind of sticks out. He sticks out a lot more than the black one."
Which one does Ryan prefer?
"Whatever they give me," Ryan said. "You've gone talk to those [equipment] guys. It's their deal. It's whatever they give me that week."
Ryan certainly has gotten a good grip on Kyle Shanahan's offense in Year 2. He established new franchise single-season records with 4,944 passing yards and 38 touchdowns while completing 69.9 percent of his passes and averaging 9.3 yards per attempt. Ryan led the league with a 117.1 passer rating. His body of work in guiding the Falcons to an 11-5 finish and NFC South title led to All-Pro honors ahead of New England's Tom Brady, thought to be his toughest competitor for the league MVP honor.
Roger Ailes. Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images
As Rupert Murdoch seeks to stabilize Fox News in the wake of Roger Ailes's ouster, a crucial question remains unanswered: How was Ailes able to spend millions of dollars to settle sexual-harassment claims without setting off alarm bells?
According to three highly placed sources, part of the answer is that there were few checks on Ailes when it came to the Fox News budget. “It was the culture,” one Fox executive said. “You didn't ask questions, and Roger wouldn't entertain questions.” One former News Corp executive explained that because Fox made more than $1 billion in annual profits, the funds that were used for settlements amounted to little more than “a rounding error.”
But with Ailes gone, Fox executives are now looking closely at how Ailes spent Fox money. And what they are discovering is that, beyond the sexual-harassment claims, Ailes was also able to use portions of the Fox budget to hire consultants, political operatives, and private detectives who reported only to him, according to a senior Fox source. Last week, according to the source, Fox News dismissed five consultants whom Ailes had hired to do work that was more about advancing his own agenda than Fox's. One of the consultants, Bert Solivan, ran negative PR campaigns against Ailes's personal and political enemies out of Fox News headquarters, a source said. A Fox News spokesperson confirmed, “Solivan was recently informed that his services were no longer needed.” Solivan, who had previously worked for Fox News as a general manager of the channel's website, did not respond to requests for comment.
According to one highly placed source, Solivan worked out of what Fox insiders called “the Black Room,” an operation Ailes established around 2011 to conduct PR and surveillance campaigns against people he targeted, both inside and outside the company. The “Black Room” was located on the 14th floor of the News Corp building at 1211 Avenue of the Americas, a quiet part of the office that housed Fox News Latino and some marketing and promotions employees. Fox employees Ken LaCorte and Jim Pinkerton — veteran political operatives who've worked with Ailes since the 1980s — also worked with Solivan, the source said, adding that Ailes's personal lawyer and Fox contributor Peter Johnson Jr. advised the team. (In an email, Johnson denied any involvement in “Black Room” campaigns, saying, “The only online campaign I'm aware of is yours, attempting to create a truth from a fiction with this account.”)
Related Stories Former Fox News Booker Says She Was Sexually Harassed by Roger Ailes for More Than 20 Years
Targets of the campaigns included journalists John Cook and Hamilton Nolan, who have aggressively covered Ailes for Gawker. According to one source, private detectives followed Cook around his Brooklyn neighborhood, and Fox operatives prepared a report on him with information they intended to leak to blogs. (According to the source, one proposed line of attack claimed that Cook — whose wife, Slate news director Allison Benedikt, is Jewish — was anti-Semitic.) “I'm honored to be among Roger Ailes's enemies,” Cook said.
Fox operatives also targeted Joe Lindsley, the former editor of Ailes's local newspaper, the Putnam County News and Recorder. In April 2011, Lindsley had a falling-out with Ailes and quit the paper, along with two co-workers. Ailes assigned private investigators to follow Lindsley around Putnam County. He also asked Fox host Andrea Tantaros, whom Ailes had once seated next to Lindsley at a dinner party at Ailes's home, to contact Lindsley and report back on his whereabouts, two sources said. Meanwhile, Solivan posted negative comments about Lindsley on blogs, a source said.
I was also the target of an operation, a source told me: In 2012, while I was researching a biography of Ailes, Fox operatives set up webpages to attack my reputation, and Fox funds paid for Google search ads against my name that linked to the sites. One source also said private investigators employed by Fox contributor Bo Dietl were instructed to follow me and my wife.* (Dietl's firm was used to track Andrea Mackris, the producer who accused Bill O'Reilly of sexual harassment in 2004, the source said.) When reached by phone, Dietl said, “I have no real comments. I love Roger Ailes. He built one of the great news channels out of nothing. He's a very successful guy.”
The allegations about Ailes's questionable use of Fox resources raise the issue of how much other high-ranking officials knew about his activities. Fox News CFO Mark Kranz, for instance, approved budget expenditures throughout this period, and general counsel Dianne Brandi approved contracts. Through a spokesperson, both Kranz and Brandi said they had no knowledge of expenditures for surveillance and online attacks.
Ailes, through his attorney Susan Estrich, said, “These allegations are totally false.”
Meanwhile, Fox executives continue to analyze the list of consultants on Fox's payroll to determine who is doing legitimate work for the network and who was hired by Ailes to do his personal bidding. The senior source said that more people will likely be let go in the days ahead.
* Update: On August 12, Bo Deitl issued a statement in response to the reporting in this story. It reads, in part:
Bo Dietl spoke with Gabriel Sherman yesterday and stated the [sic] he “unequivocally NEVER followed Mr. Sherman or his wife”. Mr. Dietl also stated that his company was never hired By Roger Ailes, or anyone else for that matter, to perform any work in connection with Mr. Sherman.
DETROIT - The preseason watch lists for NHL awards are void of Detroit Red Wings, as are most publications' rankings of the top 40 or 50 players in the league.
This team has some good players, but lacks superstars, one of the reasons it is widely projected to finish near the bottom of the Eastern Conference and miss the playoffs for the second year in a row.
"The league is separated by superstars," Red Wings coach Jeff Blashill said. "Generally, the best teams have a couple elite players that can separate you."
The Red Wings' best player, Henrik Zetterberg, turns 37 on Sunday. Health-permitting, he should still flourish at both ends of the ice, lead the team in points and be its top defensive forward.
But this team needs a boost from its youth to return to the postseason. They have three young forwards with star potential. One, Andreas Athanasiou, remains unsigned. The other two, Dylan Larkin and Anthony Mantha, will start the season on the same line, with Martin Frk, a young player with a booming right-handed shot.
"Ultimately, we need some young guys to become elite, and elite is a hard thing," Blashill said. "It's every single night, going against other teams' best, it's not just producing points, it's playing winning hockey and producing points. It's answering (media) every night when it doesn't go great, not just when it goes good. Those are all the types of things a guy like Zetterberg has had to shoulder for a long time.
"We need Larkin to have a great year, we need Mantha to have a great year, because they're going to garner lots of ice time. And when you get lots of ice time there's a lot of responsibility that comes with that. They'll have a big say in how our season goes."
After an impressive rookie season, Larkin took a step back, like most of his teammates. He tallied six fewer goals (17) and 13 fewer points (32), took 43 fewer shots while his plus-minus rating dipped to minus-28 from plus-11.
Mantha will try to avoid a similar fate in his second season after a strong rookie showing with 17 goals and 36 points in 60 games.
Athanasiou, whose contract stalemate apparently will extend into the season, was second on the team with 18 goals, in 64 games, and was often electrifying with his speed with ability to finish in highlight-reel fashion. He also drew Blashill's wrath for lapses in competitiveness.
"We're all kind of at a point in our careers where we're in our second or third (NHL) years, fourth or fifth years as pros, we don't want to be looked at as kids, we want to play like men and produce, so it's time," Larkin said. "We need to step up for the team and win some games."
Lines change frequently, but Mantha-Larkin-Frk was an impressive, energetic combination in the preseason. The trio will take the ice together, even strength and on the power play, in Thursday's season opener against the Minnesota Wild at Little Caesars Arena (7:30 p.m., Fox Sports Detroit).
"They both have such good shots that when you see them, when you get the puck, you're immediately trying to look for them instead of thinking shot yourself," Larkin said.
The Red Wings hope Larkin locks down the second-line center spot. That's where he played the final 20 or so games last season and at the World Championship for Team USA.
"This year I've been trying to change my mindset to find my teammates more, make my linemates better," Larkin said. "As a centerman, that's your goal. You want to have players that want to play with you and you want to have the puck a ton.
"Look at all the elite first-line centers that make players on their line better. I got a big chance playing with those guys and I think both of them, with their skill-set alone, could be 20-30 goal scorers. If they're not producing, it's on me and I've got to get them the puck and take care of our own zone and as a line, create offense on our own."
Mantha overcame adversity early in his pro career to become a building block for the organization. His rookie season wasn't without some bumps; he was scratched for two games (March 10-12) for lack of hustle. Mantha said he needs to keep his feet moving.
"(Larkin) is going to be wheeling around," Mantha said. "Frkie is going to be there every time for that one-timer. That's not a hard guy to play with. We just need to move our feet, control the puck a little bit more and maybe be in closer support to each other, and then things should go well."
Red Wings' Dylan Larkin better prepared for center role Young forward focused on improving on faceoffs, defensive game and give-and-go techniques.
Frk, the club's top pick in 2012 (49th overall), will make his Red Wings debut Thursday after being reacquired by the club off waivers early last season. He is not assured of being on the roster throughout the season. He's appeared in only two NHL games (with Carolina) and has much to prove.
"Mo is a big boy, he can stay in front of the net and do the dirty work," Frk said. "Larks has got really good speed and a very good shot. I've got to find an open spot in the zone and try to score every time I get the chance."
When Frk was debating between the Red Wings and Europe in the off-season, assistant general manager Ryan Martin asked Blashill if he would give him a "real look."
"I said I'll give him a real look for sure," Blashill said. "A real look is going to play with real players in training camp and try to get him matched up against some NHL lines. He did a good job.
"What Frkie brings to that line is real forecheck pressure. He's not always noted for that. It's an element that line needs. I think it can be a real good line but let's keep watching."
Blashill watched Frk in Grand Rapids last season and briefly wondered if the Red Wings could use his shot exclusively on the power play before deciding that's not feasible.
"He's done a good job of calming his game down and putting himself in a position where he can be an effective five-on-five player," Blashill said.
Franco-Burkinabe illustrator and artist Marto has been wryly watching from the sidelines over the past year as Burkina Faso was rocked by a popular uprising, failed coup attempt and landmark elections. His street art has provided Ouagadougou residents with a humorous commentary on historic developments and on the eve of election results he wants to send a simple message.
“I don't want to be with a political party,” Marto told RFI during a visit to his workshop in the Kologh Naaba district of Ouagadougou. “I prefer to give a message of peace,” he says.
One of Marto's most striking pieces of street art in Ouagadougou adorns the walls of the pillaged house of Francois Compaore, the younger brother of former strongman Blaise who ruled the country for 27 years. It features a soldier making traditional Burkinabe food with the caption, ‘Make maize balls, not war'.
Marto has been living in Ouagadougou for the past six years and has been particularly influenced by recent events in Burkina. A series of his illustrations depict General Diendere, head of the presidential guard (RSP) and leader of the failed coup in September. In one sarcastic drawing Diendere is featured in a baby's cot holding a number of weapons, the caption reads, ‘The RSP refuses to disarm,' with a speech bubble saying, ‘They're mine!'
His recent work has featured several themes related to events in Burkina, but he also turns his attention to world events and apt observations of everyday modern life.
“So it's a fish watching a guy in a fishbowl,” Marto says, describing a painting on a wall near his workshop. “With this painting I want to inverse the sense of watching. I like when the people looking at my pictures smile, it's important for me.”
Street art and graffiti are present in Burkina's capital, but are certainly not prevalent. Marto says there are probably five or six other people he would describe as street or graffiti artists. However, there is tradition in Ouagadougou of using simple illustrations or paintings to decorate shops and sell services in a style that is not far removed from Marto's, minus the mocking commentary.
Despite describing himself as not interested in politics, Marto has been caught up in the changes Burkina has undergone since the ousting of Compaore in street protests last October. “I think the people in Burkina are really proud of their actions. They're together, united,” he says.
When asked about his hopes for the future following elections, he says, “if the president makes mistakes the people will go out in the street.”
La Paz, Bolivia (CNN) -- Bolivian leader Evo Morales says he's worried that U.S. authorities will plant something on his presidential plane to link him with drug trafficking when he attends Wednesday's United Nations General Assembly meeting.
"Do you know what? I think they have to be preparing something," he told a convention of female farmworkers over the weekend. "So much that I'm afraid to go with our airplane to the United States. Surely when we arrive, they can plant something and detain the presidential plane."
Morales said he was still planning to attend the meeting, but feared a U.S. plot.
"They are preparing something to discredit us with drug trafficking," he said.
The U.S. Embassy in La Paz declined to comment on Morales' assertions. But some opposition Bolivian lawmakers criticized the president's proclamation.
"The president has to understand that these types of messages are not good, because he who has not done anything wrong has nothing to be afraid of, and when the president shows these fears it makes the population worry and it harms his international image," Rep. Jaime Navarro said.
But Morales' supporters said political opponents have long used such strategies to bring down his government.
"They have always tried to harass the president, since he was a lawmaker they wanted to connect him with drug trafficking and they never could prove anything, and he has always faced the accusations," Rep. Edwin Tupa said. "And now that he's president, it isn't an accident that anyone, especially the U.S. government, would try to ruin his image."
Bolivia and the United States have had diminished relations since September 2008, when each country expelled the other's ambassador. Morales, a strong proponent of the cultivation of coca plants -- the source of cocaine -- expelled the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration a month later. He also delivered a strong verbal criticism of the U.S. government at the United Nations General Assembly that year.

Whole Foods founder and CEO John Mackey would like to revise a previous accusation that Obamacare is a form of socialism.
"It's more like fascism," Mackey recently told NPR. "In fascism, the government doesn't own the means of production, but they do control it -- and that's what's happening with our health care programs and these reforms."
Mackey, a libertarian, compared Obamacare to "socialism" in a Wall Street Journal op-ed he penned in 2009. Obamacare would "move us much closer to a government takeover of our health-care system," he proclaimed.
The op-ed infuriated Whole Foods' liberal customer base, Time reported at the time. Some customers boycotted the organic food chain in protest, according to ABC.
Whole Foods could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.
Other CEOs have criticized Obamacare for intervening in the health care market. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz told the Seattle Times last year that although more Americans should have health insurance, "the pressure on small businesses, because of the mandate, is too great."
Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini has said that health insurance premiums could double because of Obamacare. And Cheesecake Factory CEO David Overton said in December that Obamacare "will be very costly" and force most businesses to raise prices or "cheapen their product."
Some business executives plan to pass higher costs on to employees and customers.
David Cameron says he is giving unemployed Britons “new hope and responsibility” by cutting their benefit payments and claims his welfare reforms are part of a “moral mission” for the country.
In an article for the Telegraph, the Prime Minister issues a sharp rebuke to Britain's most senior Roman Catholic, the Most Rev Vincent Nichols, who said recent changes had left many in “hunger and destitution”.
Mr Cameron argues that the Archbishop of Westminster's criticism is “simply not true” and says the overhaul of the benefits system, led by Iain Duncan Smith, himself a practising Catholic, was about “doing what is right” and not simply “making the numbers add up”.
His comments came as Archbishop Nichols, who will be made a Cardinal later this week, stepped up his warnings over implementation of welfare reforms.
Speaking as he set off for Rome to receive the honour from Pope Francis, he said he had been “inundated” with messages from people who shared his concerns.
He also accused politicians of all parties of all parties of a “lack of leadership” over immigration – relying on “fear” rather than something more “noble”.
The Archbishop first issued the warning in a Telegraph interview last week, describing the benefits system as increasingly “punitive” and said the situation in which many people now found themselves was “a disgrace”.
Mr Cameron said that while it is important that the church speaks out on political questions, but added: “I respect his view but I also disagree with it deeply.”
“It is sometimes said that the church should not get involved in politics,” he wrote.
“I disagree.
“Many of the great political questions of our time are also moral questions – we should not be surprised and nor should we be dismissive when members of the clergy make their views known.
“But neither should political leaders be afraid to respond.”
He added: “Our long-term economic plan for Britain is not just about doing what we can afford, it is also about doing what is right.
“Nowhere is that more true than in welfare.
“For me the moral case for welfare reform is every bit as important as making the numbers add up.”
He said it was “wrong” that people are “trapped in a cycle of dependency” or to “reward” people who can work but do not.
Mr Cameron's comments will be seen as a show of support for Mr Duncan Smith who is said to be increasingly concerned by the general tone of political debate over welfare,
fearing that claimants are frequently denigrated or regarded with suspicion.
Colleagues say that Mr Duncan Smith, an early advocate of compassionate Conservatism, is increasingly concerned about Mr Osborne's hard line on benefits claimants.
In January, he clashed with George Osborne, the Chancellor, who called for £12 billion of further cuts to the welfare budget after the 2015 election.
Mr Cameron insisted that no one would be left destitute by the welfare reforms and said the claim that the basic safety net no longer exists was untrue.
“Let's get the facts straight,” he said.
“Yes, we made the difficult but correct decision that benefits shouldn't go up faster than wages, but the safety net remains in place.”
He added: “Of course, we are in the middle of a long and difficult journey turning our country around.
“That means difficult decisions to get our deficit down, making sure that the debts of this generation are not our children's to inherit.
“But our welfare reforms go beyond that alone – they are about giving new purpose, new opportunity, new hope – and yes, new responsibility to people who had previously been written off with no chance.
“Seeing these reforms through is at the heart of our long-term economic plan – and it is at the heart too of our social and moral mission in politics today.”
Archbishop Nichols insisted that he was not attacking the principle of welfare reform but giving a voice to the reality on the ground which is being reported to him by a network of clergy and charity groups in deprived parishes.
“I said … that the fact that people are left in destitution was a disgrace, I didn't say the Government's policies were a disgrace,” he said.
“I said the fact of people left for weeks on end without any support and therefore having to have recourse to foodbanks in a country as affluent as ours was a disgrace.”
He said that it was clear that welfare reform is “necessary” and “difficult” adding: “I [am] sure that these things were unintended consequences of this attempt to reform.
“What I notice in Government statements is that they are mostly cast in the future tense: 'these reforms will achieve this, will achieve that'.
“My concern is to echo the voices that come to me of the circumstances today in which people are left without any support for weeks on end, are hungry, are destitute.
“There must be something wrong with the administration of a system which has that effect on so many people's lives.”
Speaking about the tenor of recent debate on immigration he added: “I think the idea that immigrants are a net drain on resources is false.
“We should not have a discourse about immigration which is based on fear.
“I think it is quite frankly a lack of political leadership if we fashion a debate around fear. “I think leaders ought to appeal to something more noble and something more substantial than fear.”
IN WASHINGTON state this spring, a woman died of measles — the first confirmed death of the disease in the United States since 2003. And in April, Massachusetts had its first case of measles this year (a second one was a misdiagnosis ). While an outbreak of the once-rare disease here is unlikely, thanks to relatively high rates of student immunization in Massachusetts schools , legislators are considering a misguided bill that would allow more parents to refuse vaccinations for their children by adding a “personal beliefs” exemption to the state law requiring all children to be vaccinated before they can be admitted to school. Currently, parents can only cite a religious belief or a medical reason to avoid vaccines. But even with the current limited exemptions, some schools have exemption rates over 10 percent, as the graphic below shows. That's why expanding exemptions would be a step backward in preventing a major outbreak. Indeed, the rise in vaccine rejection — that rare phenomenon where the right meets the left — is a public health issue. Allowing personal beliefs to inform parents' immunizations decisions creates a slippery slope that will only endanger whole communities. That's why states like California are headed in the opposite direction, narrowing vaccine exemptions. The more people who are immunized, the more effective the vaccines. The Massachusetts proposal , filed by state Senator Joan Lovely, should be rejected.

The Korean name of the 1992 Los Angeles riots, sa-i-gu (사이구), means “four, two, nine” — or rather 4/29, the first of the six days they tore through streets after the the Rodney King verdict came out. Given Los Angeles' large Korean population, the highest of any city outside the Korean Peninsula itself, and the fact that its Korean-owned stores took so much of the damage, the Korean media granted this unrest on the other side of the Pacific the importance of a domestic disaster, flying at least 30 journalists straight over to interpret the chaos for the dismayed and bewildered audience back home. The very next year, Korean cinema, enjoying a 1990s resurgence after a couple decades spent losing out to foreign (and especially Hollywood) imports, came out with its first and still only statement on the riots: Western Avenue.
Directed by Chang Kil-soo, a filmmaker already known for telling stories of countrymen crushed in pursuit of the American Dream, the movie (which you can watch, albeit without subtitles, on Youtube) sees the riots through the eyes of a representative Korean immigrant family: Kim and his wife, who arrive in Los Angeles in the 1970s and work hard to save up for their own convenience store in which to work harder still, and their three Korean-American children, saddled with the “English names” of Frank, Bobby, and Marian. Just before the riots break out, the film carefully gathers the entire Kim family, along with the store's sole black employee and his grown son, into their blast radius with only a single handgun for defense. But its last-act depiction of Korean suffering at the hands of black rioters comes after much more time spent depicting Koreans suffering at the hands of unsympathetic whites.
Or rather, its first two acts focus on the suffering of Marian — real name Jee-soo — after she dares to change her college major from medicine to drama, getting temporarily disowned by the enraged Kim as a result. Graduating from Yale, she moves to New York with her fledgling filmmaker boyfriend Steve, a mulleted loudmouth who takes her idea of making a movie about her own immigrant experience and turns it into an psycho-erotic spectacle titled The Exotic. “This film is so sexual,” asks a ponytailed slickster at its debut Q&A. “Did you have a hard time to act, with the Oriental morals?” Chang presents this as the humiliating nadir of Marian's futile struggle for acceptance in the country she had since childhood regarded as her own. When she justified her disobedience of Kim's demand that she become a doctor, she'd described herself as not a Korean but an American — only to have Steve describe her as “my little wildflower from the Orient.”
Western Avenue played only in Korea, and American viewers will quickly sense that the film was never intended for international consumption anyway, not least because of the sometimes unintelligible English of Kang Soo-youn, the big-name Korean actress playing the supposedly Westernized Marian, as well as the Korean-born actors in most of the other “Korean-American” roles. “On set, she struggled a bit with the English, but she was really working hard,” Josh Stolberg, who played Steve before becoming a writer and director in Hollywood, wrote to me in an email. “I've seen her in Korean films where she was able to speak in Korean and I think she's AMAZING — but this was definitely tough.”
Though miscast, Kang nonetheless has several memorable turns of phrase throughout the movie, such as Marian's comeback to the (also heavily accented) insistence from her older brother that she shouldn't hang around actors and artists because “most of them are either homosexual or have some kind of mental problem.” “Yeah, I have mental problem,” she replies. “It's my life!” She also offers a brutal criticism of Steve's work: “Can I tell you frankly? Your script sucks. Of all the thing I read, yours is worst.” This even before their final falling-out, a scene culminating in Steve's bitter lament, “Why do you give up your Oriental ideals of submissiveness and male superiority?” Though Stolberg remembers Chang as “a lovely guy,” they did have their differences when it came to performance styles. “I remember shooting an intimate scene with [Kang], and I was playing it very subtle, and I remember the director really pushing for ‘more emotion.'”
“They didn't want anything ‘internal,'” wrote Stolberg. “It was far more melodramatic (in terms of performance) than I was used to” — but very much the kind of tone Korean cinema and television drama has always made work, and in which its best creators have somehow even excelled. “I knew going in that I was playing a complete asshole. I was always pissed off and pompous and a jerk. It was completely over-the-top. That said, I was fine to play the part, partially because, having grown up watching movies where Asian actors were forced to play stereotypes, I felt fine about it being our turn. I was also young, though,” as well as excited about the opportunity the role represented and “awed by playing opposite one of Korea's most well-known actresses.”
Realizing how Steve has used her, Marian plunges into a downward spiral, developing a drug habit (or rather, having white acquaintances foist it upon her), roaming the streets in a frizzy-haired daze, and blankly submitting to the advances of a Chinese artist-thug. Before long, her (also mulleted) younger brother turns up in the parody of American urban decadence into which she's fallen to bring her back home to Los Angeles, where she reconciles with and starts working for her dad back at Kim's Market on Western Avenue. The film places her homecoming around the same time as, and incorporates security-camera footage of, the real-life March 1991 shooting of black teenager Latasha Harlins by Korean convenience store proprietor Du Soon Ja. Her death would become not just a reference in many a subsequent Tupac song, but a factor often cited as precipitating the riots of the following month.
“I didn't kill no Latasha!” insists Kim to a throng of black protesters chanting outside his store, but to no avail. Norman, the prison-radicalized son of Kim's loyal black employee, has taken it upon himself to organize some of the protests. “We're boycotting Korean stores because most Koreans are arrogant, they're rude, they don't talk to black people, they don't laugh with black people, and they look down on us like we're a piece of shit,” he complains to Marian, his onetime childhood playmate. “Not all Koreans are like that!” she replies, a statement that would now come with a hashtag. She argues that conflicts between blacks and Koreans in Los Angeles erupt due to mere cultural misunderstandings, while Norman says that's all the more reason for Koreans to get with the American program, illustrating the city's ongoing clash of incompatible norms taken on more recently (and much more over-reachingly) in Paul Haggis' Crash.
“I did know, going in, that the film was supposed to be a statement on the riots from the Korean perspective,” wrote Stolberg. “And I was excited to be in the film because I was here in Los Angeles for the riots and it really affected all of us. So I wanted to help them tell their version of the story.” In their paper “How the L.A. Riots Was Remembered in Korean Cinema: Western Avenue and Shattered American Dreams,” Hallym University's Park Seung Hyun and Kyungpook University's Kim Yeonshik argue that, in telling that version of the story, the film “acknowledges the tension of the ‘black-Korean conflict' surrounding shops that Korean Americans manage in black ghettos, but refuses to name this inter-ethnic conflict as the main cause of the riots. The film instead complies with a popular perspective argued by Korean Americans during and after the riots: Korean Americans were set up as the scapegoat of African Americans' anger against deep-rooted racial discriminations in the United States.”
Park and Kim also clarify several aspects of the film's perspective on the riots that wouldn't necessarily be obvious to a non-Korean audience. “The upheaval in Los Angeles, the most favored city of Korean immigration in the land of new opportunity, was a watershed event for rethinking the life of Korean Americans in the United States,” they write. “This event eventually led Koreans to recognize that there was something deeply wrong with the American system,” specifically “an absence of social legislation and protection,” and this “shattered their faith in the American society and the American dream for which they had emigrated from their motherland.”
The film's Kim and other Korean immigrants to America of the 1970s still regarded the United States as “the colonial liberator and Korean War savior,” a “prosperous and freedom-loving country” as opposed to their underdeveloped homeland “where authoritarianism was deeply woven into the fabric of everyday life.” The aspirational vision of America as a blank socioeconomic slate, “a place where individual labor and effort determine success and failure,” thus blinded the Korean immigrants of that era to their new country's “long-standing racial problems,” even as they propagated various myths about the groups they'd never encountered in Korea. “My mom and dad tell me that your parents like black people!” says an aghast Korean-American classmate to a grade school-aged Marian in the film's prelude. “My mom told me that if you touch black people or stuff they touch, you'll turn black too!” (Implausible as it seems, Park and Kim call this “an undeniable stereotype that Koreans once held.”)
A quarter-century after the riots, America's reputation as a place of racial strife has only spread, joined by reputations for substandard infrastructure and political disorder, while the rapidly developed South Korea, for all its own problems, looks stable and advanced by comparison. (Just a few years ago, there was a bestselling book here by the name of 우리가 아는 미국은 없다, or The America We Know Doesn't Exist.) “Before she leaves, she asks me why I bring her to America,” a despondent Kim says after Marian flies the Korean coop to try leading an “American” life. “Now, I ask myself same question.”
Many Korean immigrants of Kim's generation find themselves in a promised land that inevitably falls short of their rigid expectations — with children raised there who often do the same — and unwilling or unable to return to their now-unrecognizable homeland. Still, few have had their pursuit of the American Dream turn out as badly as Kim's, which Western Avenue, true to melodramatic form, turns into a near-Greek tragedy amid the roaring flames, shattered glass, and smoky skies of sa-i-gu. The 25-year retrospectives now appearing on these most destructive riots in American history show the surprising extent to which most of the afflicted areas have recovered, even on the Western Avenue of the movie's title.
That nearly 30-mile-long street runs through, among other places, heavily damaged parts of what was then known as “South Central” and, further north, the west side of Koreatown, a neighborhood that also took its lumps but had a better defense in the form of Korean shopkeepers armed with much more than Kim's little-used revolver. I happened to live in Koreatown myself for all of my most recent years in Los Angeles. For half of those those years I lived just off Western Avenue, which I often walked just a few blocks up to catch a movie at the local branch of the Korean CGV theater chain, each piece of Korean cinema I saw there preparing me for my own eventual move across the ocean.

After Modding a buch of modern vehicles and not getting satisfaction, I decided to get something old school: I bought my first 1969 Datsun Roadster and did an S14 engine swap. It was my first old car and didn't know much about looking for "rust." After twisting the frame on that one, I choose to get another car and found My '68 in Baltimore. I stripped the whole car, Gusset and sandblasted and powder coat frame. Media blasted the whole body and install every bolt, nut and washer new. Also build a S15 SR20DET. To transfer power to wheels I'm using a custom made Mazda RX7 rear differential with 411 gears and LSD. Front brakes we borrow from 300ZX TT and made our own custom 2 piece rotors. SSR Longchamps 15x10.5 /15x7.5 wrapped on Toyos R888. Custom Bride Interior. Custom dash and gauges. SLS AMG matte paint job. the only one carbonfiber hardtop ever made! Carbonfiber fender flares.

The best way to begin a career is to set up an instant connection with the listener, and then do something else: create some sort of unique context for your music. Burial's South London Boroughs, released on Hyperdub in 2005, did that effortlessly. It was a sonic painting of south London at night, crafted with spray-cans of a dark two-step beat, wonky synths and his signature bass. It was like a Banksy had suddenly appeared. Next to nothing was known about Burial except for where he came from, and he marked his territory by inviting us to ride through the dark streets of south London's outer boroughs with beats alone.
When Burial released his self-titled LP a year later, it was hailed as one of the most complete dubstep albums ever created. Although much of the album was brooding and harsh, it contained Burial's first real ambient composition: Night Bus. It's the sound of hopping on a near-empty bus in the early hours of the morning, weighed down by an aching comedown. The sounds used are minimal, but the track is profound; drizzling rain and haunting synth pads interlock to create something as introspective as it is beautiful.
The strange case of Burial, Four Tet and the identity conspiracy Read more
If Night Bus was Burial's first slice of true ambience, Endorphin – from his second album, Untrue, is his greatest. It's the sound of being haunted, by people who themselves feel haunted; ghostly voices materialise from crevices of deep bass and warped horn sounds, and the whole track is cloaked in a film of crackle and fuzz. It's the epitome of Burial's ability to make everything sound stunningly nostalgic and emulate a state of saudade through a sense of pining and loss, without ever coming across as sentimental.
Archangel is sometimes overlooked in Burial's catalogue, perhaps because of its accessibility. The fact that it's his best known track shouldn't stop it making this list: it somehow makes Ray J – an ex of Kim Kardashian and maker of the Kardashian-referencing track I Hit It First – sound magical. It's driven by a simple two-step beat and echoes of warped vocals, and makes the perfect soundtrack for twilight walks through the city, played ultra-loud through a tinny set of earphones. It's Burial at his poppiest, while retaining the future garage flair that colours all his work.
The final track on this list from Untrue, Raver is perhaps the best example of Burial's wide-ranging but indefinable approach to music, with twisted snippets of vocals, rippling synths and a thumping two-step beat. It's the kind of track that gets all Burialheads feverishly trying to decide what genre he is working in. Future garage? Post dubstep? Post future? Burial is not someone genre labels can be attached to easily; it's probably just better to accept the music for what it is.
Following Untrue, Burial had been unmasked as William Bevan after a campaign by the Sun's Gordon Smart. Since then, he hasn't released another full LP, but instead has worked on EPs and singles that are longer, multilayered epics. Arguably his finest work of all, Burial's reworking of Paradise Circus turns it into something even more poignant and atmospheric. It's a breathy, perfect moment of disassociation. There are so many parts to it, but best are the heavenly pitched-up vocals and triumphant synths in the closing minutes.
School reunions can be dire congregations of people trying to out-impress each other and remembering each other as the dicks they were in their teens. That might not be the case with Elliott School in Putney, which produced members of So Solid Crew, the Maccabees, DragonForce, the xx and Hot Chip, as well as Burial and Four Tet (though the former would definitely be a no-show). The two producers worked together a few years back on Moth/Wolf Club, but also joined forces in 2012 for Nova. Mixing Burial's garage rhythms with Four Tet's ear for delicate melodies, it's a shuffling, delay-filled track. Rumour has it that Thom Yorke has joined forces with both to make some more tunes. They make for a fantastic duo, although conspiracy theorists will still argue they are one and the same.
Elusive dubstep star Burial gives a rare interview Read more
Fizzing with frenetic energy, Rough Sleeper signalled a move towards longer, more upbeat compositions. It's still got the same click beats and trapped voices, but feels somehow different. The highlight of the track is undoubtedly the electric-piano hook that dominates the middle section, winding its way through the vocals and fuzz. Although it is nearly 14 minutes long, it seems to finish in a flash – testament to how gripping it is.
Burial's most recent EP, Rival Dealer, was the closest thing so far to a third album. In a rare interview, Burial told BBC 6Music the release was centred around a motif of “anti-bullying tunes that could help someone to believe in themselves” and it features recurring samples from an interview with Nasa scientist Melissa Dawson Higgins. Come Down to Us is the pinnacle of the EP – Burial at his most experimental and positive. Cinematic, almost Christmas-sounding chimes make it a quasi-hymn, and it ends on a crackly, evocative recording of Lana Wachowski talking about the difficulty of coming out as transgender.
Sweetz is far and away the most divisive tune Burial has worked on, with the critical gauge of the YouTube likes/dislikes bar highlighting that (868 likes and 246 dislikes at the time of writing). But it's the fact that it is so deliciously polarising that contributes to it being the most interesting track Burial has released. Driven by a hyperactive “yeah, we fucked up” sample that constantly shifts in tone, stop-start bass rhythms and hypnotic synths that come and go as they damn well please, it's Burial gone avant garde. It's constantly threatening to shape-shift into something completely different, yet it somehow – just – sticks together as one piece. It's a playful side to Burial that's never been shown before and hints at a more off-the-wall approach to come in the future.
Every year, Ontario universities graduate over 2,000 new PhDs, but generate perhaps half that number of new jobs for professors. Academic reform advocates Ian Clark, David Trick and Richard Van Loon have looked at these numbers, and concluded Ontario has a problem: "the increase in supply of PhDs has vastly outstripped the increase in demand for new full-time professors."
Yet Canadian universities are part of a global academic marketplace, exporting graduates to other countries, and importing freshly minted PhDs from elsewhere. In my own research, I have studied just one segment of that market: the demand and supply for new economics PhDs.
It might appear that economics suffers from a serious over-supply of doctoral students. Ten Ontario universities have PhD programs in economics. While some of these programs are small, the largest, at the University of Toronto, has 71 PhD students in its program.

Most of these programs' graduates do not get academic jobs in Ontario. But they're not driving taxis either. Online listings, such as these from University of Toronto, McMaster, and Waterloo, describe recent graduates' employment outcomes. Other universities will provide the information when asked. [Pro tip: before starting a PhD program, ask for information on the number of students who start, the number who finish, and where recent graduates are currently employed. Think long and hard before enrolling in any program that will not provide that information.]
Graduates of Ontario's economics PhD programs can be found working in Asia, Europe, Australia, in government, or the financial sector. Recently, more have ended up working in the U.S. As Western University professor Igor Livshits puts it, "It is as if some barrier came down – U.S. employers seem much more willing to interview and hire Canadian, or at least Western, graduates."
There are many reasons why a new PhD might accept an offer from an Australian or Asian university – the weather, for example, or proximity to family. But some graduates have no choice but to leave the country. One of the paradoxes of the Canadian university system is that, despite an ample supply of Canadian-trained PhDs, universities are choosing to fill some academic positions with foreign workers. Using data collected together with Anindya Sen at University of Waterloo, I found that half of new assistant professor positions in Ontario economics departments were filled by graduates of U.S. PhD programs. Some of those are Canadian citizens or permanent residents; the majority has no discernible connection to Canada before arriving.
Canadian universities aspire to be globally competitive, so hire the best new PhD graduates, without regard to citizenship or country of origin. A cynic might suggest that a Canadian university would hire a Johns Hopkins graduate over a McMaster graduate because having professors with American PhDs impresses students, and raises the university's score on the Times Higher Education world university rankings. The reality, however, is that universities have very specialized teaching needs. In any given year, there may simply be no suitable Canadian job market candidates who are able to teach, say, a graduate course in behavioural economics.
Yet while universities' international hiring practices are understandable, they raise the question: If Canadian universities are recruiting professors from the United States and elsewhere, why do we need to have PhD programs in Canada?
One answer is that Canadian PhD programs may generate graduates who know something about Canadian policy issues, and who are more likely to carry out research using Canadian data.
Another answer is that doctoral candidates play a vital role in the university system. They assist professors with their research, working as teaching assistants and delivering courses. Having a doctoral program signals a university's quality, and makes it easier for the university to attract faculty members. Doctoral programs also represent a potential revenue stream for universities.

Blake Johnston, an entertainer from the firm Dwarf My Party, was reportedly set alight with a cigarette lighter during the St Kilda club's end-of-season party at a pub in Melbourne. His sweater and pants were significantly burnt and he was reportedly “not very good emotionally”.
A workmate of Mr Johnston's said he was physically unharmed but “very very shaken”.
"Blake was speaking to a player when another man, who he thinks was another player, set him on fire,” the workmate, who was not named, told the Herald Sun.
"There was a lighter being passed around. And because people were wearing costumes, including Blake, most of the outfits were flammable."
The incident caused an furore in Australia, particularly after the head of the Australian Rules competition, Andrew Demetriou, burst into laughter on television after being told of the incident. He later apologised and said he thought it was a joke.
“After I found out that it was true, it's just reprehensible,” he told 3AW radio. "I was flabbergasted… That would've been one thing I could have never predicted that we would deal with.
The traditional alcohol-fuelled end-of-season celebrations have led to numerous scandals in recent years, including a player photographed engaging in sex acts with a dog, a player dressing as Adolf Hitler and another parading through the centre of Melbourne while brandishing a sex toy and wearing a woman's nightie.
The Australian Football League said the burning of the dwarf was “bizarre” and unacceptable.
"The players have been playing pranks on each other by setting the shoelaces on fire and signing happy birthday and they've singed the clothing of a performer that they had there," said a manager at the league, Mark Evans.
"I think these practices of Mad Mondays and bizarre behaviours and all those sorts of things, I think they're well gone. It's certainly bizarre, but it's not conceivable that this is the way we should operate at celebrations for (the) end of the season.”
A Polish Brexit supporter has admitted stealing Eddie Izzard's pink beret during a pro-EU rally - but claimed he did not recognise the comedian.
David Czerwonko, 26, admitted snatching the pink hat off the comedian's head during the march down Whitehall on September 3.
Izzard was caught on camera giving chase in high heels after Czerwonko, a chef who has lived in the UK for two and a half years, seized the beret.
As officers pinned the man to the floor, Izzard retrieved the colourful headwear and replaced it on his head. It was later taken away by police as evidence.
Prosecutor Amanda McCabe said the pink beret, which had UK and EU badges pinned to it, was of unknown but personal value to Izzard.
She said: "The march was well-attended, there were thousands of other people taking part.
"Mr Izzard was at the head of the march. A group of four masked men stood in front of the march with a large banner supporting the Brexit campaign."
The banner halted the march, blocking their path as they approached the cenotaph in Whitehall, she added.
Referring to the four men, the prosecutor said Mr Izzard said: "This is the face of Brexit: masked and dangerous."
Speaking of Czerwonko, whose face was half-concealed by a bandanna, she continued. "He approached Mr Izzard, reached out to him and grabbed at the pink beret he was wearing at the time."
Wearing faded denim jeans, a black Puma T-shirt and a full beard, Czerwonko pleaded guilty to theft at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday.
Tobi Olu-Iyiola, defending, said the 26-year-old did not know that the man with the pink beret was Izzard, and did not attend the march with the intention of causing trouble.
She said: "He saw a gentleman who he did not know, he did not know who Eddie Izzard was, he just noticed a pink beret and grabbed it and ran off with it.
"He said it was an instinctive and silly reaction ... something he won't be repeating again."
The event was one of a series of 'March for Europe' rallies across the country on the anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War, demanding a pause in the Brexit process.
Chair of the bench Robin Westlake acknowledged that "there was not a great deal of planning, it was a fairly spontaneous reaction and the beret was recovered".
Czerwonko, of Clitheroe Road, Brentford, was fined £185, and ordered to pay a £30 victim surcharge and £85 court costs.
Tennis legend Billie Jean King, who is openly gay, was supposed to be part of the official U.S. delegation at Sochi, but she will miss at least the opening ceremonies. (Photo: Brad Barket, Getty Images for Women's Sports Foundation) Story Highlights Presidents from Germany, France say they won't attend
President Bush attended 2008 Games
U.S. delegation was led by Michelle Obama in 2012
The White House delivered a strong message of opposition to Russia's anti-gay laws Tuesday with the announcement of its delegation to the opening ceremony of the Sochi Olympics.
The White House delegation will include an openly gay athlete: tennis great Billie Jean King.
It will not include the president, first lady or the vice president, all who headed the previous four Olympic delegations, or a cabinet secretary, only a former one. This marks the first Olympics since the 2000 Sydney Summer Games that a U.S. president, vice president, first lady or former president has not been a member of the delegation for the opening ceremony, which will be Feb. 7 in Sochi.
BRENNAN: Obama selection of King 'genius'
A statement from the White House said President Obama's schedule doesn't allow him to travel to Sochi. "President Obama is extremely proud of our U.S. athletes and looks forward to cheering them on from Washington," the statement said. "He knows they will showcase to the world the best of America -- diversity, determination and teamwork."
The delegation "represents the diversity that is the United States," the statement said.
Gay rights groups viewed the announcement as a strong statement. Andre Banks, the executive director of All Out, said, "It's hard to look at this delegation without seeing it as a criticism of Putin's anti-gay laws. … What it's doing is showing the true power of the Olympics, the ability to move people, to change people's minds and open them up to new ways of thinking. The delegation is shining a light on the values of the Olympics."
Also absent will be French President Francois Hollande and German President Joachim Gauck, who announced earlier that they will not attend the Sochi Games.

In London in 2012, Michelle Obama led a delegation that included Olympians Dominique Dawes, Brandi Chastain and others. In 2008, President Bush attended the Beijing Olympics. In 2002, President Bush also attended the opening ceremony for the Salt Lake City Winter Games, as is the custom for a head of state to attend a home Olympics. And former president George H.W. Bush was part of delegations to the 2008 and 2004 Games.
The delegation to Sochi will attend events, meet with U.S. athletes and attend the opening ceremony. Janet Napolitano, the former Secretary of Homeland Security and current president of the University of California, will lead the team. It also includes figure skater Brian Boitano, the 1988 Olympic champion.
The delegation for the closing ceremony on Feb. 23 will include Caitlin Cahow, a two-time Olympic medalist in ice hockey, who is also openly gay. Bonnie Blair, five-time Olympic gold medalist in speedskating, and Eric Heiden, five-time Olympic gold medalist in speedskating, are also members of the delegation.
Cahow, a law school student at Boston College, was studying for her Constitutional Law exam (talk about irony) when the White House released the names of the delegation.
"It's obviously a statement that's being made, but I think it's an incredibly respectful one," Cahow told USA TODAY Sports. "Basically, the White House is highlighting Americans who know what it means to have freedoms and liberties under the constitution. That's really what we're representing in Sochi and it's not at all different from what's espoused in the spirit of Olympism.
"So I think it's just a great group of people. I can't believe I've been named one of them because it's a remarkable roster and I just think that we're going to represent what the best America can be. Hopefully, it will unify all of Team USA and send a message of love and acceptance to the world."
Human rights groups applauded Obama's decision after Russian parliament passed a law in June, barring "propaganda" about "nontraditional sexual relations" as a means of protecting children.
"It sets the right tone in terms of the inclusion of LGBT folks," said Shawn Gaylord of Human Rights First, an international advocacy group based in New York and Washington. "We also agreed that sending the president, vice president and members of that delegation who would be at that level, that was not the right level to be representing the United States. We appreciate that decision and we believe it's the right one."
"Having two prominent LBGT athletes in Billie Jean King and Caitlin Cahow guarantees that the U.S. will not shy away from supporting the LGBT community while in Sochi," said Hudson Taylor, the founder of Athlete Ally, which is focused on ending homophobia in sports. Athlete Ally and All Out recently launched a campaign focused on Principle 6 of the Olympic charter, which says sport does not discriminate on grounds of race, religion, politics, gender or otherwise.
The International Olympic Committee has said it has received assurances from the Russian government that athletes and spectators will not face discrimination based on sexual orientation.
The president of the Sochi organizing committee, Dmitry Chernyshenko, told USA TODAY Sports last month that there will be no repercussions at the Olympics for anyone who wears rainbow pins or makes other small gestures in response to the legislation. Russian president Vladimir Putin has banned rallies and demonstrations for the period around the Olympics and Paralympics, but IOC president Thomas Bach said last week there will be special protest zones during the Winter Games in Sochi.
The White House's move is the latest episode in a tense relationship between the two countries. President Obama canceled a September meeting with Putin in Moscow in response to Russia's decision to grant temporary asylum to National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden. The rare diplomatic snub was viewed as a response to other issues, including missile defense and human rights (the ban of U.S. adoptions of Russian children and anti-gay legislation).
Though the White House did not address the reasons behind the make-up of the Sochi delegation, Obama has been outspoken about what he's called Russia's retreat into a "Cold War mentality."

"I have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgender persons in ways that intimidate them or are harmful to them," he said.
As for any impact on the Olympics, Obama said, "I think Putin and Russia have a big stake in making sure the Olympics work, and I think they understand that for most of the countries that participate in the Olympics, we wouldn't tolerate gays and lesbians being treated differently. They're athletes, they're there to compete. And if Russia wants to uphold the Olympic spirit, then every judgment should be made on the track, or in the swimming pool, or on the balance beam, and people's sexual orientation shouldn't have anything to do with it."
The spotlight of the Sochi Olympics could provide a pivotal moment for the gay rights movement in Russia, U.S. human rights advocates believe. The Olympics are often remembered for iconic gestures, such as the black-gloved salute on the medal stand at the 1968 Mexico City Games. Whether it be rainbow-painted fingernails or a same-sex kiss on the medal stand, some gay rights activists believe Sochi might be remembered for such a gesture.
Others, such as King, believe increased public awareness comes through such gestures.
"Sometimes I think we need a John Carlos moment," King told USA TODAY Sports three months ago, referring to the U.S. track star who was expelled from the 1968 Games along with American sprinter Tommie Smith for protesting racial discrimination.
"I think there's watershed moments, benchmarks," King said then. "I would hope the majority of the athletes would speak out. It's a great platform."
Then she sighed. "I wish I was 21 again and in the Olympics."
The composition of the American delegation is a gesture of a different kind, a not-so-subtle thumb of the nose toward Russia.
Most aspiring U.S. Olympians have deftly avoided the issue, treating the topic as if it was an Olympic flame too hot to handle. The notable exceptions have been figure skater Ashley Wagner and ski racer Bode Miller.
"For me, I have gay family members and I have a lot of friends in the LBGT community," Wagner said in September at a Team USA media summit. "I have such a firm stance on this that we should all have equal rights."
Miller also addressed the issue without hesitation. "I think it's so embarrassing that there's countries and people who are that ignorant … as a human being I think it's embarrassing," he said.
Once the athletes arrive in Sochi, they are obligated to follow Rule 50 of the Olympic charter, which states "no kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted" at any Olympic site.
Miller also took aim at the premise of Rule 50. "Politics in sports and athletics are always intertwined even though people try to keep them separate," he said.
As the presidential delegation to the opening ceremony shows, sports and politics are often as connected as the Olympic rings.

Carlos Queiroz has told Manchester United to keep faith in beleaguered boss David Moyes, writes Simon Bird in Florianopolis, Brazil.
The former Man United coach says Moyes was eyed-up years ago by Sir Alex Ferguson to take over the Old Trafford giants, and there is no point scrapping their grand plan now.
Queiroz, now manager of World Cup qualifiers Iran, said: “The success of Manchester United was based on a couple of principles. The first thing was it had a good foundation of consistency, continuity, trust and confidence.
“The other thing I learned when I was at the club: The club always had a strong belief with the people that work inside it - they trust themselves.
“I want to believe that it is just a tough time at the moment and in a short period of time we will see the Manchester United everyone expects.
“I have been in that experience and the most important feeling is to trust each other, believe each other, and make the right decisions. If you are not able to win today, I am sure tomorrow things will be right. I think they need to be given time.”
Former Everton manager Moyes has seen the championship-winning squad he inherited go backwards, losing eight matches in the Premier League so they now trail leaders Chelsea by 15 points.
They are outsiders to qualify for the Champions League next season as they are 11 points behind fourth-placed Liverpool with 12 matches to play, and are out of both domestic cups.
Moyes' tactics are being questioned and he is losing key players, including long-time captain and defensive rock Nemanja Vidic, in a major summer rebuild.
Queiroz, who worked for five years at United alongside Ferguson over two separate spells, revealed he had a hunch Fergie fancied his fellow Scotsman as his successor.

The Portuguese said: “Moyes deserved the chance. It was not a decision which fell out of the sky. It was a decision that came from a lot of mature thoughts and reflections.
“In the near future, he will put things right, I am very much confident about that. He was a manager Sir Alex and I always respected when we worked together. He did a great job at Everton. I think he just needs time to adapt.
“Sir Alex is still there. I am sure David has been watching around and has a lot of great advisors in this moment.”
But Queiroz says it was inevitable that this transition season would be testing for the club.
He said: “It has been difficult for Manchester United this season, there is absolutely no doubt about that.
“I knew changing coach would not be easy. To cross this bridge after Sir Alex being with the team for so many years, in one way, I think we were always going to have to expect some difficult moments. It is natural.
“But I am very much confident the club has a lot of experience, it is strong, it has a persistent culture. I am sure David Moyes in a short period in time will do the right things at the club and the team will start to perform."

The police have registered a case against Mahatma Gandhi's great-grandson, Tushar Gandhi, for allegedly making offensive remark about freedom fighter Bhagat Singh."The case was registered against Gandhi under Section 295 (A) (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class) of the IPC after a complaint by chairman of an NGO Jan Jagriti Manch, Kishan Lal," Bimal Kant, Inspector at Jalandhar Police Commisionerate, said on Sunday.Mr Gandhi, speaking to media in Jaipur, had called Bhagat Singh "guilty of British rule, due to which Mahatma Gandhi had not asked for suspension of his sentence." Members of the NGO had submitted a memorandum to the Police Commissioner on Saturday demanding a case against the Mahatma's great-grandson.
Each week from now through the end of the 2016 season, Bucky Brooks will be checking in on the Coach of the Year race with a snapshot of his top five candidates. Here's how the leaders shape up after Week 15.
NOTE: The up/down arrows illustrate changes from last week's COY rankings.
RANK 1 Jason Garrett, Cowboys 1 Credit the Cowboys' ultra-cool coach for deftly handling a burgeoning quarterback controversy. Garrett not only supported his young signal caller, but he helped the offense craft a game plan that helped Dak Prescott regain his rhythm as a passer. With the 12-2 Cowboys sitting atop the NFC behind a pair of rookie offensive playmakers and an underrated defense, Garrett deserves top billing at this point of the season.
RANK 2 Jack Del Rio, Raiders 2 The ex-NFL linebacker helped the Raiders clinch their first playoff berth since 2002 through his aggressive game plan and calculated gambles. Whether it's going for it on fourth down or dialing up a critical two-point conversion, Del Rio has pushed all of the right buttons to get Oakland into prime position to earn the AFC West crown and a first-round bye. Moreover, he has molded a young, athletic squad into a legitimate Super Bowl contender.
RANK 3 Bill Belichick, Patriots 2 The Patriots have claimed the AFC East crown for the eighth straight season behind Belichick's tough-love approach. The wily head coach has not only unleashed a dynamic offense that torments opponents with a physical running game and dink-and-dunk aerial attack, but he has quietly put together a stingy defense that's only allowing 16.6 points per game ( tops in the league). Considering how the unsung unit has done it without star power, Belichick deserves every accolade for pulling rabbits out of the hat in Foxborough.
RANK 5 Mike Mularkey, Titans NR The Titans' surprising revival lands Mularkey on the list this week, with his squad tied with Houston atop the AFC South. Mularkey has ignited the surge by accelerating the development of his franchise quarterback, Marcus Mariota, with clever schemes and power-based complementary running game. With his trusted partner Dick LeBeau building a menacing defense, Tennessee suddenly looks like a legitimate playoff contender heading down the stretch.

The issue could present problems for Speaker Paul D. Ryan as he makes the case for a tax overhaul at a factory in Ohio on Wednesday. The House Ways and Means Committee will not hold hearings until later this month to turn Mr. Trump's tax-reform wish list into an actual bill, but Republicans have promised it will be made law by the end of the year.
The administration is still tinkering with how best to translate its sparse initial wording into legislative language. When the proposal was first presented, government officials were not yet ready to articulate, for instance, how a small business would be defined under the new tax plan.
The lack of answers on such fundamental issues leads only to more questions. Officials were also still debating the future of the so-called carried interest tax loophole, under which executives of private equity companies currently pay taxes on their compensation at a relatively low rate of about 24 percent.
The pass-through issue is another area of disagreement between the White House and House Republicans, who proposed a higher top pass-through tax rate of 25 percent in “A Better Way,” the legislative blueprint they issued last summer. Proponents of the higher rate argue that it could prove critical for helping Republicans pass tax legislation that does not cause deficits to balloon and that it would reduce incentives for individuals to try to game the system by incorporating themselves.
Stephen Moore, a Heritage Foundation economist who advised Mr. Trump during his campaign and talks frequently with administration officials, said Mr. Trump's economic team knew it was problematic to have employers paying lower tax rates than their workers because of low pass-through rates. He said the White House was inclined to tax income that is reinvested in businesses at a lower rate than money that is pulled out and used for personal reasons.
“We don't want the owners to just take the money out of the company and use it for personal consumption, even though they have every right to do that,” Mr. Moore said. “The goal is to get more businesses reinvesting in their companies.”
Robert Willens, an independent accounting consultant, suggested that having “parity” between the corporate tax rate and the pass-through rate might not be such a bad thing after all. For individual taxpayers, incorporating oneself is harder to do in practice than it is in theory, he said, and bigger businesses might be less inclined to turn themselves into partnerships to chase lower rates if all businesses were subject to the same relatively low tax level.
“Leaving a disparity will lead people to be spending all their time trying to become business entities,” Mr. Willens said.
True to form, the partisans at Fox seemed angrier at Hillary Clinton for speaking out in support of gun safety than they did at the man who murdered dozens of people.
Always finding a way to turn Hillary Clinton into the villain of any unfolding national story, Fox News and other conservative commentators turned their ire on her following one of the deadliest mass murders in U.S. history, displaying more scorn toward the former Secretary of State than toward the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas.
“Hillary Clinton slammed for ‘ignorant' statement on guns after Las Vegas shooting,” read the Fox News headline.
Clinton's supposed crime was calling out the gun lobby in the wake of the massacre. Specifically, she called attention to a law that congressional Republicans, with support from the NRA, are trying to pass that would make it easier for everyday Americans to purchase silencers, a radical and dangerous initiative for a country already drowning in firearms:
The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots. Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get. — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 2, 2017
And many other right-wing partisans piled on.
The Heritage Foundation's Ben Shapiro lashed out, calling Clinton's tweet “Ignorant, irrelevant and exploitative.”
And Dana Loesch, who narrates hysterical NRA videos for a living, tried to minimize the importance of the pending silencer bill:
Suppressors only reduce by a few decibels, still same decibel level as a jackhammer. https://t.co/aj0AvJMZwv — Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) October 2, 2017
Apparently, the argument from NRA apologists like Loesch, in the wake of one of the worst gun rampages in modern U.S. history, is that silencers won't make the gunshots completely silent, and thus are unnecessary.
It's a ridiculous argument to make at any time. But after a mass murder, when dozens have been killed and hundreds injured by a single madman with a stockpile of weapons, it is especially repugnant. Gun industry apologists are left with tacitly acknowledging the price for letting Americans arm themselves with hundreds of millions of guns is that lots and lots of people are going to die by gunfire.
But still Fox News obsessed. “We saw some rotten conduct today,” lamented Fox News politics editor Chris Stirewalt. Except he wasn't referring to the Las Vegas gunman. He was referring to Clinton.
“We knew her to be rapacious, but we did not know her rapacity would include exploiting this on Twitter in moments. She went to a gun control debate instantly,” he continued.
The latest gun massacre comes at a time when the Republican-led House has moved to loosen firearms laws, not tighten them.
All Clinton did was to point out the heartless cruelty in such moves. For that, she, and not the murderer, gets vitriol from Fox News.
Milan Sekiz has mixed up all the ingredients required for a perfect little bakery. This scene is packed with detail for such a tight footprint, and the color choices represent a refreshing change from a lot of City building.
Cakes are obviously the main reason to visit any bakery, and Milan's display counter doesn't disappoint. Check out the tempting selection on show (and don't miss the detail of the ventilation slits in the refrigeration units under the counter — nice).
And then through in the back-of-house, Milan has made great use of “brick bricks” and kitchen unit pieces to create a smart prep area. I particularly like the unbaked croissants sitting to the left. However, unless there's another oven lurking off-scene somewhere, I'm not convinced this store has quite the baking capacity it requires — the visible oven provision seems somewhat lacking. But kitchen efficiency concerns aside, this is a wonderful little model.

A student from the US has teamed up with a local band to play at mandals as part of his PhD thesis on festive sounds
New Jersey-based Julian Lynch rehearses popular tracks along with members of the orchestra band Tanay Beats
For the past two weeks, Julian Lynch, a PhD student from the US, has been listening to songs from the Marathi blockbuster, Sairat, on loop. Lynch's fascination for the movie's songs is evident when we meet him at a rehearsal hall in Prabhadevi.
"I've always been a fan of Bollywood music, but now I'm in love with Marathi songs as well," he says, before offering to strum Yad Lagla for us on his guitar. The moment Lynch starts strumming, the chatter in the room dies down. Almost on cue, the 32-year-old goes on to deliver a flawless unplugged version of the song, from start to finish. The performance is met with a thunderous applause, and some proud back slaps from the Maharashtrian boys assembled in the room. After all, the blue-eyed New Jersey lad appears to be ready for his first Navratri festival, where he will be playing along with Prabhadevi-based orchestra band, Tanay Beats.

"I'll be performing at a mandal in Walkeshwar and Kalachowkie," informs Lynch, who arrived in Mumbai on September 7. The anthropology student is here as part of his PhD thesis to study the importance of different sounds in society. "I chose India as a field site, and Mumbai specifically, because here, sound is a very big part of public life," he says, adding that the focus will be on the many sounds in Indian festivals. Lynch also plans to interact with environmentalists and activists to understand the impact of sound on social life.
Lynch got interested in the subject four years ago, when he visited Mumbai during a vacation which coincided with Ganesh Chaturthi. "When I was here, I happened to read news reports about activists protesting against noise pollution and the violation of decibel levels during festivals. This seemed interesting because I have always equated sound with music, which is not necessarily the case here," he says.
At the time, Lynch even attended the Marbat festival in Nagpur, which involves the construction, parading and burning of statues meant to represent the forces of evil. When he returned to the US and decided to do his PhD from the University of Wisconsin, finding a subject of study wasn't difficult. "The impact of sound during festivals piqued my interest to the extent that I wanted to visit Mumbai again. My research methodology is based on observation, which involves living here and examining it first -hand," says Lynch, who plans to be in Mumbai till February.
However, a big challenge for Lynch was to touch base with the right people who could provide insight into the subject. "I began looking for contacts of Ganesh mandals in Mumbai. Luckily, I found the email address of Neeraj Ghatge, the secretary of Ankur Mitra Mandal in Dadar. He wrote back saying that he knew Rohit Talekar, who helms a band named Tanay Beats, and could help me out."
Since then, Talekar and Lynch have been jamming together at a rehearsal hall in Ravindra Natya Mandir with 60 other boys. "While he plays the guitar, we play the banjo and drums," says Talekar, who also works as a steward on a cruiseliner in Venice and is currently on a three-month vacation.
Talekar feels it's Lynch's openness to experimenting that has helped him bond effortlessly with the rest. "We celebrated his birthday here and even gifted him a guitar," says 25-year-old Talekar. The camaraderie between the boys is visible when an amused Lynch tells us that he has been taught some rude words in Marathi, along with the customary, "Tu kasa aahes (how are you), ikde ye (come here) and tikde zaa (go there)". "I've been part of music bands back home, but the nature of our relationship is very professional there. Here, it's more like a family. I love the fact that these boys always have each other's backs," smiles Lynch.
• Who's on the move? Check out the status of 2015's free agents
GEELONG star Steven Motlop "definitely" wants to stay with the club and won't be lured away by a rival offer, Cats football manager Steve Hocking says.
Focus has quickly turned to a host of big-name Cats falling out of contract, after a flat 48-point loss to Collingwood on Friday night brought the curtain down on one of the great eras of sustained AFL success.
Geelong is out of contention for a ninth-consecutive finals berth, with speculation mounting about the futures of a host of champion veterans beyond this season.
But Motlop, 24, looms as the key re-signing from the current playing list, along with ever-improving ruckman Mark Blicavs.
Speaking to K-Rock radio station prior to the loss to the Magpies, Hocking said Blicavs was on the verge of putting pen to paper and was confident that Motlop would turn his back on a potentially bigger pay-day elsewhere.
"Blicavs, it's any week, probably any day (to sign a new deal). And Motlop definitely wants to stay at Geelong," Hocking said.
"It's just really his manager and the club just getting the right deal and agreeing to what I think is fair enough on his front, and … he's a restricted free agent in 12 months' time, so how do you contract through that?
"I think that's a very reasonable question to be asking."
Motlop told Nine News he was happy at Geelong and indicated he was most likely to sign soon.
"My manager and Steve Hocking are going through the work now, so I'm pretty happy at Geelong,” he said.
When asked if he would remain at the club, Motlop had this to say: “Yeah, definitely most likely, yep.”
Although Motlop had a relatively quiet night against the Magpies with 15 touches and a goal, his line-breaking speed and match-turning X-factor make him a rare commodity – and an attractive target for rival clubs.
"He may be a player that's got some interest from other clubs - it's not of interest to him," Hocking said of the 87-gamer.
"He wants to stay at Geelong and he's made that quite clear to us. I think it's more around the free agency part of it, that's a changing landscape for clubs and how do you see someone of that talent?
"He influences so many parts of the game and the way we play and he's a great finisher as well, as we saw last week. It's trying to reach and land on a point that is suitable to both parties."
Hocking said tall defender Jake Kolodjashnij was also "very keen" to stay with the Cats.
The 20-year-old has played eight of the past nine games after making his debut in round 12 against Melbourne.
"Someone like Kolodjashnij has just started out and is still finding his feet," Hocking said.
"We've been really impressed with what he's done to this point in time. He's a solid citizen, so he's certainly someone that you can build a future around at the back end."
NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- GoPro Inc. shares GPRO, -0.47% slid almost 7% in midday trade Monday, after a French journalist said Michael Schumacher's brain injury in a skiing accident last year was caused by the mounting of a camera on his helmet. "The problem for Michael was not the hit, but the mounting of the Go-Pro camera that he had on his helmet that injured his brain," Formula 1 commentator Jean-Louis Moncet told a French radio station. Moncet said the information had been given to him by Schumacher's son Mick. The son said the racing driver is waking up "very slowly" from a medically-induced coma. GoPro shares have more than tripled in value since their June IPO.

Bill Maher, in relaying his last "New Rule" on the Jan. 27 episode of "Real Time," returned to an argument about the GOP presidential race that he has advanced regularly:
"You know, Republicans have created this completely fictional president. His name is Barack X. And he's an Islamo-socialist revolutionary who is coming for your guns, raising your taxes, slashing the military, apologizing to other countries, and taking his cues from Europe, or worse yet, Saul Alinsky! And this is how politics has changed. You used to have to run against an actual candidate. But, now, you just recreate him inside the bubble and run against your new fictional candidate."
(You can watch the clip of the whole "New Rule" here or read the transcript here.)
Andrew Sullivan did a great job in January of laying out the Obama created by the GOP and then showing how the facts spoil the Republican fiction.
And, to be clear, we're not just talking about fringe right-wing attention-seekers making stuff up about Obama. The GOP presidential frontrunner (is he still?), Mitt Romney, accused Obama of "putting free enterprise on trial" and delusionally claimed:
"President Obama believes that government should create equal outcomes. In an entitlement society, everyone receives the same or similar rewards, regardless of education, effort, and willingness to take risk. That which is earned by some is redistributed to the others."
Apparently, extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy makes you an opponent of free enterprise, and continuing the bailout of the banks makes you a proponent of wealth redistribution.
But even as commentators start to note the GOP effort to create a fictional Barack Obama, it looks like Republicans have decided to double down on the stupid. That is, they have strayed from plausible lies (lies that, to the uninformed, could feel true) to absurd ones.
For example, on Tuesday, Sean Hannity made the ridiculous comment that Osama bin Laden's death "wouldn't have happened if he [Obama] had his way."
Really think about what he said for a second. When SEAL Team Six went into Pakistan to take out bin Laden, who gave the order? Here's a hint: He has an oval-shaped office in the White House. If Obama didn't want bin Laden killed, bin Laden would still be alive.
(Oh, and you'll notice the president didn't ask for Pakistan's permission to breach its borders, nor did he offer any apologies for doing so.)
By now, the story of the bin Laden mission is well known. Success was not assured. The president weighed all of the information at his disposal, which had been accumulated from years of bin Laden surveillance since his inauguration, and he took a calculated risk to approve the mission. According to Vice President Biden, when the president's senior advisers made their final recommendations, nobody (with the exception of CIA Director Leon Panetta) gave an unqualified yes. Most waffled. Biden offered a solid no. But the president opted to go forward.
If the mission had failed, Hannity would have surely placed the blame on Obama for making a reckless decision. But it worked. And now he's saying the president didn't want it to happen?
To throw a little more absurd syrup on top of the bat-s%#t-crazy sundae, remember that Obama didn't just succeed in getting bin Laden; he made it a priority, unlike his predecessor, who said,
"I really just don't spend that much time on him, to be honest with you."
In short, Hannity says the president who prioritized finding bin Laden and made the difficult and risky decision to take out the al-Qaida leader (something the previous president couldn't be bothered with) didn't really want to kill him.
This is the level of absurdity to which the right has sunk in creating a fake Barack Obama.
Maybe this is all a good sign. Maybe, despite gains in the 2010 midterms (when the Republicans successfully created a fake health care law: Death panels! Care for illegal immigrants! They're taking your Medicare!), the GOP doesn't think it can beat the real Obama in November. Or maybe Republicans are worried by the numerous instances of buyer's remorse since November 2010, with successful candidate and statute recalls in Wisconsin, Ohio and Maine, as well as recent polls showing the GOP in trouble in Ohio and Obama doing relatively well in the battleground states.
Whatever the reason, the American people may be easily fooled at times, but nobody outside of the right-wing echo chamber will believe that Barack Obama didn't want to kill bin Laden. (That's even less believable than the idea that the guy who opted to fight in Vietnam and was awarded three purple hearts was a coward, while the guy who pulled strings to get into the National Guard to avoid going to Vietnam was a courageous leader, right?)
The current Volkswagen CC, the long-wheelbase Passat with the "stylized sweeping roofline," is not the last word in car design. At some point, even Volkswagen had to realize how boring it was. Otherwise, they couldn't have come up with a successor launched in Turmeric Yellow. Also known as Curcuma, or gold, if you prefer not to beat around the bush. But call it what you will, the car under the paint is a more upscale proposition than the CC, with a price tag still kept in the $35,000 range. And for that kind of money, the Arteon has to be the prettiest four-door on the market.
Note: The Arteon is due on the U.S. market in mid-2018. The TDI model we drove is European-spec.

This is confirmed by the number of heads turned towards it on the road. Granted, the wild color helps, but VW's latest peek into entry-level Audi territory is definitely a conversation starter. This car stands out in a general parking lot, instantly triggering interest.
But being a sedan, perhaps the Arteon's most important upgrade is the 5.2-inch increase in wheelbase compared to the outgoing CC. The result is that, while the roofline may still compromise rear headroom, the extra space means you can sit two tall adults in the back with ease. And it will swallow their bags too. Lifting up the hatchback, we threw in a long weekend's worth of luggage for three, literally. The trunk is simply huge, and if you need more, the 60/40-split rear seats allow the car to carry 55 cubic feet of your stuff, including items as long as 80 inches.
Máté Petrány / Road&Track
Once in the driver's seat, the nodding continues. As tested, the Arteon came with a 9.2-inch center touchscreen with gesture controls. The system works well, and despite the fact that once it reaches America, the screen will shrink to eight inches with physical knobs, optioned with the 12.3-inch Digital Cockpit, the cabin shouldn't disappoint.
As long as you don't look too often at the dollar-store clock in the middle, of course. That piece of quartz magnificence looks even cheaper than what it must cost, but after all these years, I must assume this feature to be something expected from a V-Dub.
With its headlamps smoothly integrated into the grille, the Arteon looks wider than it is, further enhancing the sporty image. Fire up the 2.0 turbodiesel though, and the driving experience will be anything but GTI-threatening. Instead, with the smooth and well-programmed DSG automatic, the Arteon TDI is a proper all-wheel drive long-range cruiser.
That's clearly what it was designed to do in the first place: Rule the longer routes both on and off the highways as a quiet, neutral GT that likes to cross countries without using as much fuel as a gas-powered supermini would.
Máté Petrány / Road&Track
Sure enough, 240 horsepower and 369 lb.-ft. of torque can motivate it to move faster if you're in a hurry, but the TDI's real treat is the range it provides.
Throughout the week, our average was 43 miles per gallon, with three adults on board, climbing up and down mountains when not keeping pace on the highway. The Arteon did it all while looking the part, pleasing us with its clear navigation and decent sound system. There's really not much more one could want from a fairly base four-cylinder sedan.
Sadly, diesels are done in America, thanks to none other than Volkswagen itself. That means the 2019 Arteon will get the 2.0 gasoline engine instead, with 276 hp and 258 lb-ft., but certainly nowhere near the fuel economy.
Still, whatever engine is up front until the electric motors take over completely, the Arteon is a noticeable step up from its predecessor, and a car worth trying out if Audi prices seem unjustified for a moment. Just go for the R-Design package, and enjoy the extra legroom. It's only a matter of time before somebody does a Golf R swap anyway.
Progress on this implementation of “Distributed Liquid Democracy” is going well, Steadily progressing into something amazing – “Mesh Democracy”.
The underlying system is up and running. It works, kind of like a car without bodywork “runs”, but still should not be driven on the road.
To try and make it easier to see what is going on, I chucked some handwritten data at d3/Sankey to get the nice representation/vote graph below.
And then implemented it into the system.
The name “Mesh Democracy” is due to this being an implementation of “Liquid Democracy” designed to run on RS's F2F network, and hopefully at a lower level Mesh networks in general. Also because “Mesh Democracy” currently has no meaningful results on Google it is descriptive and “unique”.
There will probably not be an actual release of Mesh Democracy until RetroShare 0.6 is out in the wild – the source code can be found here https://github.com/chozabu/trunktesting/tree/meshdemoc
Tuesday July 18 - or hence forward known as ‘Fat Cat Tuesday' - as county councillors vote themselves massive pay rises
County council leader Steve Count Archant
Tory leader Steve Count blamed exclusion from last year of councillors from the local government pension scheme as one reason for proposing allowances much bigger than those recommended by an independent panel.
Share Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in.
The shock move by the Tory controlled council to agree an amendment – configured during secret sessions – was revealed by Cllr Count in a press release five minutes before today's full meeting of the council.
As council leader his pay will rise to £31,745 a year with the deputy leader being paid £20,627 a year.
Only one Tory refused to vote for the rise – Wisbech mayor Steve Tierney who abstained. One source tells me the Conservative group was subject to a three line whip and had Cllr Tierney voted against, rather than abstain, he could have been suspended from the group.
Cllr Count said the increase in allowances proposed by the independent panel would have meant each councillor getting an immediate increase of 8.4 per cent “rising to 21 per cent increase by the end of the four year term to make the scheme fairer”.
The panel had agreed that the current rate of basic allowance is too low and was not at a level that would allow councillors to make the time commitment required.
This was “particularly now there are fewer councillors, larger electoral divisions and rapidly increasing populations within many divisions.”
But the panel also said considered whether the current financial and economic climate should inform its recommendations and decided that this was an important factor, and the public would quite rightly expect it to form part of the panel's considerations.
Under the proposals they put forward councillors would have received £8.600 a year (from the current £7,933.32) and would have seen the annual allowances budget drop from £836,316 to £751,500.
That has now changed with Cllr Count costing the new scheme at £936,726 – he said the previous figure was in reality £859,840 to take account of pension contributions.
Had the county accepted their independent panel's view, the council leader would have seen his pay rise from £21,000 a year to £25,000. The panel concluded that the leader's extra responsibilities in terms of the portfolio post he also occupies in the new combined authority headed by the mayor. The authority pays no allowances to elected members.
Cllr Count said “We acknowledge the difficult task set for the Independent Remuneration Panel.
“Regrettably we feel unable to accept the recommendations which we feel do not meet the requirements of the guidance, particularly in relation to ensuring that councillors do not suffer significant financial loss as a result of undertaking the role. “In that regard it is the duty of the Panel to clearly recognise and base their decision on the time commitment that councillors make, week in week out, and we really feel that this just hasn't happened.”
He added: “Elected councillors spend an average of 20 to 30 hours per week carrying out their duties, for which they currently receive a basic allowance in Cambridgeshire of just over £7,933 per annum, the lowest in the country.”
The Carolina RailHawks, now re-branded as North Carolina F.C., announced plans Tuesday to pursue a Major League Soccer franchise in the Triangle and to build a new 24,000 seat stadia.
Local entrepreneur Stephen Malik, who bought the RailHawks 14 months ago, unveiled the new brand during a press conference at City Market, saying the goal is to get the club in the MLS in the next 12 to 18 months along with a new stadium that he believes will take two to three years to build.
“We love putting the ‘North' in front of ‘Carolina Football Club,' you know, none of our other professional sports franchisees do that,” Malik said, in reference to the Carolina Panthers and Carolina Hurricanes. “We do feel like we're a representative of the state.”
Malik, 51, said there are eight sites he's considering for a new seat stadium, which could cost $150 million, but didn't hint as to where. The club currently competes at WakeMed Soccer Park in Cary.

Malik said there is more than enough people to support another professional sports team in the area. The Hurricanes play at PNC Arena.
“All along I intended to bring us to the highest level,” he said. “One of the analyses the leagues do is on a per pro franchise basis. We rank extremely high in that basis ... there's room in our market. We love the ‘Canes, but there's room for another franchise.”
Malik said he and his investors are prepared to pay for the stadium out of pocket, but “at the same time, to win a bid … we need to have the best long-term stadium situation and I think that at the same time we'd need some public support on infrastructure and parking at the least.”
Raleigh spokesman John Boyette said he was unaware of discussions about building a stadium in the city. Cary Mayor Harold Weinbrecht said he had just seen the team's announcement and was awaiting more information, but was pleased to see efforts to add sports revenues after the loss of events due to the dispute over House Bill 2.
Malik said that he believes the stadium could have an economic benefit to whatever area were to get a new stadium.
“We have such a growing area with the development that's being put around it that the stadium could be a centerpiece,” Malik said. “The economic impact as a lot interest coming our way.”
Despite the two to three year timeline it would take to build a stadium, Malik mentioned the team could start MLS play before it's done.
“We have a unique situation … if you look at how some things have gone in the past, maybe we could play sooner rather than later,” Malik said. “It all depends on the (MLS) and what they're ready for.”
With public money needed to make a serious bid to earn a spot in the MLS – St. Louis and Cincinnati are among other cities competing to join the league – teamwork was a theme repeated by the speakers at the event.
“If we want to attain a franchise, we need to gain community support, governmental support and corporate support,” Malik said. “We need to show that we deserve a franchise.
MLS released a statement about North Carolina F.C.'s expansion bid on Tuesday.
“Major League Soccer appreciates North Carolina FC and Steve Malik's interest in bringing an MLS expansion club to the Triangle,” said MLS Executive Vice President Dan Courtemanche. “We recently met with Steve and he discussed his exciting vision for growing soccer in the area, including his ambition for an MLS expansion team. We look forward to learning more about his plans as they develop.”
MLS commissioner Don Garber, who is scheduled to give his “State of the League” address Friday in Toronto, has said he plans to cap the league at 28 teams, but Malik isn't worried about the competition.
“We're going to turn all our tumblers before (the other clubs do) and that's a big part of it, being ready first,” Malik said. “We have an owner, a local owner and a stadium plan.”
In the meantime, North Carolina F.C. will continue to compete at WakeMed Soccer Park. It's likely it'll join the United Soccer League for the time being due to the rumored end of the modern-day North American Soccer League.
The USL, which is the home to many of the MLS' developmental squads, is having been a launching pad for some of the the top-tier league's most successful clubs in terms of attendance, such as the Seattle Sounders and Portland Timbers.
“We feel good about the NASL, but as you know, there's a lot going on,” Malik said.
The club also announced intentions to bring a National Women's Soccer League to the area within the next six months.
It won't be the first time a women's soccer team has competed in the Triangle. The Carolina Courage competed from 2001 to 2003 and recorded attendance numbers that surpassed the RailHawks' average. The Courage folded due to its league's struggles.

S.F. scientist resigns after faking data S.F. RESEARCH

A scientist at San Francisco's Gladstone Institutes has resigned after admitting to making up data on grant applications submitted to the National Institutes of Health.
Paul Muchowski was an investigator at Gladstone studying a compound that has potential to protect the brains of people suffering from Alzheimer's or Huntington's disease.
The federal Office of Research Integrity announced last Friday that Muchowski had admitted to "falsifying and fabricating data" on several applications, including one that received funding from the National Institutes of Health.
Specifically, Muchowski admitted to reporting fake results from early experiments that had not been done at the time the grant applications were submitted. As a result of the findings, Muchowski has agreed to have his research supervised for two years.
The misconduct findings apply only to Muchowski's research applications, and not to scientific work that was published. In an interview Monday, Muchowski declined to comment in detail on the findings, but he noted that none of his published work will be retracted.
"The research isn't questioned, and the scientific field wasn't led astray by fake data," he said.
The case against Muchowski does not prevent him from keeping his current grant money or applying for future grants, although it could make such endeavors very difficult, said scientists not involved in the case.
The investigation started several months ago, when a colleague of Muchowski alleged instances of scientific misconduct. Muchowski resigned from Gladstone in November, before the federal sanctions against him were announced.
"As individuals and as an institution, we at Gladstone stand for, and insist upon, the highest standards of integrity in all that we do," said Dr. R. Sanders Williams, president of Gladstone, in a statement.
"But human beings are fallible, and examples of misconduct are an unfortunate possibility in any organization or community," Williams said. "We are saddened by this event, but heartened that our research culture encouraged a colleague of Dr. Muchowski to alert us to this matter."
Muchowski was featured in a profile in The Chronicle last February. The article discussed Muchowski's work with his father, Joseph Muchowski, and a third scientist from the University of Maryland. Neither the elder Muchowski nor the third scientist was included in the federal sanctions.
It's hardly a surprise to see a company like Samsung copy Apple. But Comcast? Well, that's certainly a new one for the record books.
In a comically bad attempt to mimic some of Apple's mojo, The Verge reports that Comcast recently slapped a “Designed by Comcast in Philadelphia” tagline onto the back of its Premium Backlit Remote.
Sound familiar?
It should.
On the back of every Apple mobile device, going all the way back to the first iterations of the iPod, there's that one familiar sentence: “Designed by Apple in California.” The slogan also appears on the company's packaging, with Apple even going so far as to create an entire ad campaign around the slogan a few years ago.
Call it psychological marketing if you will, but the phrasing arguably helps create a sense of comfort insofar as it helps make an otherwise cold tech product seem just a tad more inviting.
On this very point, Joel Spolsky wrote the following about the phrase all the way back in 2007:
You think of California, not the actual state, with its endless dismal boulevards full of muffler shops and donut stores, but the California of memory: the Beach Boys, the Summer of Love, and the beatniks, a utopian land of opportunity, an escape, where you go when you leave behind the cold winters and your conservative parents back in Cleveland. And “Apple” in California is, of course, on the literal level, a computer company, and not a very nice one, but put those words together and you think of apple orchards, and the Beatles, and you think of how Forrest Gump got rich off of Apple stock. And “designed in California…” It's not made. It's designed. In California. Like a surfboard. Or a Lockheed XP-80.
On the other side of the coin, it's hard to lay out the benefits of associating a remote control of all things with Philadelphia, a great city to be sure, but one that doesn't evoke the same type of imagery as California. Whereas California is synonymous with beaches, movie stars, and technological innovation, Philadelphia brings to mind Benjamin Franklin and the Liberty Bell, or perhaps Boyz II Men and Will Smith if you're looking for something more recent.
One can only hope that is, perhaps, a tongue-in-cheek-type of stunt from Comcast as opposed to a serious marketing effort.
Gov. Bobby Jindal said Mariner Energy officials told him this afternoon that all seven wells that were operating at Vermilion Block 380 at the time of the fire today have been shut in, which would mean no oil is leaking.
"If that's true it's a very important step," Jindal said, adding that state officials are still seeking independent verification of the company's claim.
He said it's too early to know what sparked the fire, which was first reported to the Coast Guard at 9:19 a.m. by workers at an adjacent rig. As of early this afternoon, he said the rig was still burning. He said Mariner Energy officials said the burn could be caused by oil that was stored on the rig.
At the time of the fire, the wells were producing 1,400 barrels per day of crude oil and 9.2 million cubic feet of natural gas, Jindal said.
The 13 workers who were on board the rig are currently on board a vessel, the "Candy Apple," and will be taken by helicopter to Terrebonne General Hospital for observation, Jindal said.
He said there have been unconfirmed reports of a "sheen" in the area near the fire, but that Coast Guard officials could not verify it during a flyover.
Indianapolis - Montee Ball ducked into the lobby and walked through a tunnel of cameras at Lucas Oil Stadium. What does this not-so-fast, not-so-strong, not-so. . . anything. . . running back expect to run in the 40?
"We'll see. Sunday will show what that will be," Ball said. "Fast. Fast. I don't know. 4.24?"
Ball laughed. He knows he won't touch Chris Johnson's record at the NFL scouting combine. But with a nod and an "of course," he also agreed that this 40-yard dash will be critical.
And with two more steps, Ball exited into the hallway. This isn't only an important week for Ball. It's a gut-check week and off-season for the running back position in Green Bay. Last season was a prolonged open audition in the Packers' backfield. Five players in all - including one person selling cars and another the team refused to re-sign for months - took turns as the lead back.
Here in Indianapolis, the Packers can talk to alternatives. Wisconsin's Ball and Alabama's Eddie Lacy are two players who could be available at the Packers' 26th pick. Both offer a different element.
About a half-hour after Ball spoke, Packers coach Mike McCarthy said in that same lobby that a "three-down back is what you want to play with." The Packers must figure out if that player is already on the roster, in free agency or at the scouting combine.
"No one likes to come out of the game," McCarthy said, "and I'd rather them stay in the game. Just looking back at my experiences, it's nicer when you have one guy and you're feeding him."
To recap, the baton was passed from Cedric Benson to Alex Green to James Starks to Green to Ryan Grant to DuJuan Harris. At times, backs split carries. Other times, one shouldered the load. By season's end, Harris finished as the Packers' No. 1 back. The 5-foot-9, 208-pounder carried the ball 42 times for 170 yards and two touchdowns in Green Bay's final three games.
With a full off-season and training camp, maybe Harris is more than Samkon Gado Lite. Still, his running style and body type may be better suited for a change-of-pace role. Elsewhere, hamstring, ankle, toe and knee injuries have gnawed at Starks' potential for three years. Green remains an unknown.
The Packers have not actively pursued running backs under Ted Thompson. In the general manager's eight drafts, he has selected only four running backs - Brandon Jackson (second round, 2007), DeShawn Wynn (seventh, 2007), Starks (sixth, 2010) and Green (third, 2011). One reason is that ironclad, weatherproof running backs aren't in high supply anymore.
"Today's game, there's not too many of those guys out there," McCarthy said. "The fact of the matter is that's a very demanding position."
So that's why Ball and the 231-pound Lacy could be particularly appealing to Green Bay. They're different than the specialized backs flooding the league. Ball already has met with the Packers. Lacy, who isn't working out due to a hamstring injury, said he did as well.
Last year, Ball knew it was a "huge gamble" to return to Wisconsin. He saw his odometer reaching dangerous heights. That second-guessing only intensified before the season when Ball was assaulted on his college campus.
Now, the dust has settled. He's no ankle-breaker. Nor is Ball a bruiser or a speed demon. But again, Ball proved to be remarkably reliable. With the Badgers, he finished with 924 carries for 5,140 yards and an NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision-record 77 touchdowns. Ball's position coach, Thomas Hammock, and fellow players have compared him to Hall of Famer Curtis Martin.
He grew up idolizing Terrell Davis, but he'll take it.
"Nothing really stands out - like speed or strength," Ball said, "but we're very balanced overall and very consistent."
Ball believes that's what teams today want, too. Musical chairs proved detrimental in Green Bay's backfield. The workhorse running back is not extinct after all.
"I take pride in being an every-down back," Ball said, "and I feel that's what a lot of teams are looking for right now because you can keep me in on first, second and third down. I can make the big-time block for a quarterback to make the big-time pass up field."
Lacy is another option. The man who is a te'o-ed Notre Dame's Manti Te'o in the national championship for 140 yards on 20 carries can see himself in Green Bay's offense.
"I feel as though (defenses) wouldn't just be able to spread the field out," Lacy said. "They'd have to actually have to defend the run as well. If Aaron Rodgers is the quarterback, you're not going to put nine guys in the box.
"I was able to show up in the big games on the big stages, and in the NFL every game is a big game no matter what. So if I was able to perform well in those games, you know it should be an indication that I can do the same thing in the NFL."
If either player bottoms out at the combine and/or their pro days, the Packers may grow weary. Neither can afford to plod through their 40s and maybe the answer to the Packers' problems is already on the roster.
Either way, Green Bay will be exploring three-down options this off-season. In 2012, that was one missing piece.
And after four years, the Packers can't ignore that running back three hours away.
"You can count on me when I have the ball in my hands - 924 carries, only two fumbles," Ball said. "So I do a great job of protecting the football and I score touchdowns. You can count on me to make the play and be there for you."
He also described a pre-Obamacare landscape, in which people like his son—those with pre-existing conditions—would have been denied health insurance. And for sick children, “if your parents didn't have medical insurance,” Kimmel said, “you might not live long enough to even get denied because of a pre-existing condition.”
Kimmel's speech was timely, given that the latest iteration of the Republican health-care bill would allow states to charge people with pre-existing conditions more for health insurance as long as they create high-risk pools. On Monday, President Trump told Bloomberg he wants the GOP's bill to be “every bit as good on pre-existing conditions as Obamacare,” and said the bill is not yet in its final form. About a quarter of Americans under 65 have pre-existing conditions that would have made them uninsurable before Obamacare's protections were implemented.
The monologue also underscores the importance of personal stories in keeping Obamacare—or at least its core principles—alive. The law's particulars are difficult to understand, even for experts, but personal tales of either woe or relief travel far and wide. Before the law was passed in 2010, individual horror stories of coverage denials for acne and the like helped stir up support for national health reform.
More recently, some Trump voters I meet tell me they oppose Obamacare, even if they themselves have not been affected by it. It's enough for a family member or neighbor to see their rates jacked for them to sour on it. Indeed, polls show most people don't feel the Affordable Care Act directly affected them, but they do feel it either directly hurt or harmed the “people of your state.”
That's just how health care is: You don't need it until you really need it. Now, viral stories, like Kimmel's, of people in dire need of health care might be the thing that saves the law from repeal. (Who can forget the town hall in which a lifelong Republican told House Speaker Paul Ryan, “I want to thank President Obama from the bottom of my heart because I would be dead if it weren't for him.”) To be sure, there is no shortage of stories of middle-class people who are financially strained by the law. But nothing quite captures attention like a needed operation just out of reach.
The debate over cost-sharing reduction subsidies might not resonate, in other words, but this quote of Kimmel's, uttered between sobs, just might: “If your baby is going to die, and it doesn't have to, it shouldn't matter how much money you make.”
We love ourselves a grandma who knows how to knit. But we have to say, even the most cozy of afghans can't quite compare to the fruits of grandmother Holly Stewart's labor. Because those fruits are giant, quilted penises.
Yes, a real life, Kansas City-based grandma has turned her passion for free love into an art endeavor that's certainly got our blood pumping. It's called "Local Grandmother Quilts Giant Penises" and it encapsulates so many of the things we cherish in this sweet, short life: sex positivity, fiber crafts and badass women of a certain age.
Stewart's exhibition is currently on view at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, a vision made reality thanks to a Kickstarter initiative with one of the greater names in Kickstarter history. Again, "Local Grandmother Quilts Giant Penises." In the video below, Stewart explains how her interest in decorative members sparked from her time working in a sex toy factory.
"I was looking on Craigslist for jobs and I saw an ad for a position that was sex positive and I had to know what that was," Stewart explains casually, standing before a giant multicolored phallus. "When I looked at it is was to be a de-molder in a dildo factory. I just knew I needed to be able to tell my grandchildren I had even applied to be a de-molder in a dildo factory. When I got the job it was even better."
Coolest. Grandma. Ever.
It wasn't long before Stewart's work began inching its way into her creative headspace. Yes, dildos were on the brain.
"One time while I was painting and it wasn't working out, I noticed I had some pins and foam core on my desk and added them in and brought it to my [art] professor for critique, and he immediately said 'That looks like a dildo,'" Stewart explained. "So I had to be honest about what I was doing because I was way more interested about putting the pins in the foam core than I was in painting."
And, voila, an art movement was born. Stewart's Kickstarter raised $308, surpassing its $250 goal, thus bringing those textured members to the gallery space for all to see. The pledge levels wonderfully ranged from "Schlittle" to "Chub" to "Schlong" to "Hard On" to "Throbber" for the big spenders, and featured rewards including "a small bag of sequin semen."
Now that the exhibition is up and running, we can officially report that the massive, quilted man parts are more wondrous than we ever imagined. The works are as feminist as they are hilarious, as affirmative as they are transgressive. Sparkly, colorful, big and small, hard and soft, the penises on display truly capture the manifold possibilities of a phallic shape when separated from the shackling confines of human flesh.
"I really like them," a former UMKC student told the school's independent newspaper. "I wish real penises looked like this." So do we, anonymous former student. So do we.

YANGON, Myanmar
A Rohingya advocacy group urged the government of Myanmar on Tuesday to cooperate with a UN fact-finding mission as it presents new evidence of attacks against Muslim civilians in western Rakhine state.
The London-based Burmese Rohingya Organization U.K. (BROUK) published a new report that contains evidence Rohingya have been targeted in an organized manner by state forces in northern Rakhine state during military operations since last October.
“What is new about the material contained in this report is that it documents, through photographs, testimony and forensic analysis, physical evidence of attacks against civilians,” BROUK said in its report.
The report was based on more than two dozen interviews with Rohingya refugees in the Cox's Bazar region of Bangladesh, who fled the Maungdaw area last year.
Evidence of gunshots and other weapon wounds were checked against information collected by international groups working in the refugee camps, according to the report.
BROUK urged the government to further investigate the physical evidence of abuses against civilians in the area.
“The government should cooperate with the UN fact finding mission into the violence that took place following October 9th,” it said.
It added that the need for full accountability and justice is essential not only for the Rohingya community but to the broader process of reconciliation in Rakhine state.
The UN Human Rights Council decided in March to send an international fact-finding mission to Myanmar to investigate atrocities against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine but the government rebuffed that decision, saying it does not reflect the situation on the ground.
The rate of progress toward full federal marriage equality has been nothing short of breathtaking, but for some organizers it's still not fast enough.
Case in point: Illinois. That state went from having no relationship recognition to civil unions to full marriage equality in a matter of just a few years, an absolutely phenomenal rate of change. But now one legislator is looking into ways to hasten things even more.
Currently, marriage equality is scheduled to start in Illinois in June 2014. But State Sen. Don Harmon has filed an amendment to a bill that could push up the date to as early as February. The legislature won't have an opportunity to vote on his proposal until Feb. 4, so we'll need to check back in then.
Meanwhile, Hawaii is racing alongside Illinois toward a governor's signature on a marriage bill. Same-sex couples in that state could begin having weddings as early as December.
And as usual, we have more good news from surveys and lawsuits in a variety of states. The surprising thing about last week's advances is that many of them happened in more conservative areas, so if you want to feel good about Arkansas, South Carolina, Kentucky and Montana, you're in luck.

Around the ‘Verse
– Ben is flying Solo this week.
– Vanduul are everywhere at CIG this week – we got looks at the Void heavy bomber (carries torpedoes and boarding ships) and there'll be more Vanduul ships to see in the coming weeks.
– Where is Star Marine? – Still no date. They're working very hard on it, and now additional resources from around the company, including the new programmers in Germany, are working to try to get the netcode up and running and out the door.
– Keep checking comm-links, hoping to go to PTU in the not too distant future.
– CR is still in the UK working on mo-cap and p-cap shoots.
– E3 week in LA. CIG has been walking the floor to see some cool titles.
– Chris couldn't make it to E3, but he sent along a video message for the PCGamer PCGaming panel (video airs)
– CitizenCon 2015 tickets went on sale, and already sold out. Events will be awesome, event will be October 10th in Manchester (INN will be there). The con will be shared with everyone else via livestream.
News from the Spectrum
6:00 – Santa Monica – Darian Vorlick and Travis Day
– Preparing for Alpha 1.2.0 release of SC. Preparations of that include a full balance pass on all the weapons, all the items, all the missiles. All the feedback they've collected, there will be a full top to bottom rebalance pass.
– Also adjustments to physically based damage.
– UI designer Zane Bien is working on the HUD for the Vanduul Scythe.
– GOST (Game Object State system) – working on how to integrate that into the lighting system. If you're in a Tali, once you get to a certain level of damage, warning lights will go off. If the damage gets critical, warning sirens and exit lights will turn on, pointing towards escape pods, etc…
– When you open a door or you power on a vehicle, certain lights will turn on.
– You walk into a room, and it sequentially turns on the lights as you walk through it, then turns them off again. All this sort of stuff is being integrated in with GOST.
– Little things that add extra realistic ambiance.
8:15 – Illfonic – David Langeliers.
– New grenades are being built. Can't go into details of the functionality, but they've started work on three new grenades, on the art-side. Building high-poly meshes and such. We'll find out about functionality in the coming weeks.
– Network optimization. Recently, with the item port system, there have been problems. Anything over 8 players was causing a lot of problems with players switching weapons and lagging out. Wormbyte helped out doing some profiling, found a cap in the default CryEngine network code that was throwing out packets once they were hitting the limit. After getting rid of that cap, they've been able to have some successful tests with more people online.
– Aiming down the sight on weapon – first and third person shared animations. One of the things that had to be done when fine tuning how all the guns aim down the sites, since everything is animation based, first they pulled out those animations and had them in just numbers, so designers could tweak how fast the gun comes up, how much recoil is on the gun, etc…
– Once they got those how they wanted, the animation team brought the animations back into the game and made them match up to the values the designers put in. That's a lot of the work that's going in now.
10:55 – Austin – Jake Ross and Emre Switzer
– Emre is joining from Milwaukee, finished his first week at CIG.
– He got involved with the CryEngine modding community in 2011, somewhere along the way he heard about Star Citizen. Got involved with it, started following the progress, noticed there was a position for a lighting artist, then he did some mod work, put it on reddit, it made it to the front page there, and some people saw it, liked it, got invited over to the studio, did an art test, and then got the job.
– First week he's been working on getting stuff set up. On Wednesday he started working on Gold Horizon, which will ship in 1.2. So his work will be visible very soon.
– He's doing an optimization run on all the lighting, doing a PBR run, making sure everything looks accurate.
14:10 – UK – Eddie Hilditch and Nicholas Etheridge
– World builders working on Shubin. They oversee levels, work with the design and levels, work with budgets and optimization etc… Asset builders build bricks, world builders build houses.
– They're working on Shubin, which is huge. 6 km long mining station, and you can fly down to meter scale FPS areas, lots of landing pads on Shubin, more than 9, around 20? There's the FPS level detail when you go down to the landing pads. There are vast areas on the interior as well, all seamless with no loading.
– Windows, stairs, lights, those things give a sense of scale to us, and give a sense of the massiveness of the Shubin station.
– Sounds like right now you can fly up to Shubin, land, and walk into the interior.

James Pugh with Gaige Hallman.
(Note: In the images shown in this segment, we see that there are 353,000 polygons in the Scythe)
JP – Thanks Ben, I'm here with Associate 3D artist, Gaige Hallman. Gaige, how are you doing man?
GH – I'm doing good.
JP – Thanks for coming on.
GH – Yup.
JP – So what exactly does an associate 3D artist do?
GH – We do a lot of things. We usually take over tasks from hired artists and kind of handle the overflow. So we're more of generalists for this company. In the past I've done some proxy rigs for the Vanduul, and then just handled cleanup and bugs, and now I'm handling internal damages.
JP – So it's kind of like you have your own work and then another artist has something they need help with and they come to you guys?
GH – They just dump it on us, and we take care of it.
JP – Didn't we see you on TNGS?
GH – Yeah, I was on team Shimapan.
JP – How was that experience?
GH – It was crazy. I was a full time student, and I was also graduating at the time it was going on, so it was just… a crazy time. But it was good.
JP – So the hectic nature of TNGS, has that helped you with the hectic nature of what goes on around here?
GH – I would say that, but at the same time I don't think I'll ever go through something like that again. Because I was just… no schedule should ever be like that.
JP – What was it like?
GH – Kind of like working two full time jobs.
JP – What's this job like?
GH – One and a half full time jobs.
JP – Perfect, knew you were going there. So what exactly are you working on right now?
GH – Like I said before I'm doing the Scythe, and I basically build out the internal structure for that ship. And then I've worked on doing and assisting with UV's, which shows what layers of the ship can be burned through and then the things underneath, and I'm basically doing the first pass on that.
JP – So who else aside from you is working on the Scythe?
GH – It's me and two other people mostly, Patrick Selerno, he's been doing most of the UV setup, and transferring those, and then Kirk Tomes has been doing the game setup.
JP – Does the Scythe present any interesting challenges other ships don't, particularly the human ships?
GH – I would say so, because it's a lot more organic in design, and chaotic. You'll see in the upcoming Vanduul ships, the internals and the design, the way the ship functions is basically nonsensical in a sense, but it still makes sense. It's kind of like an old 80's action movie where things are sort of kit-bashed together, whereas the human ships are way more planned and sort of clean, and the Vanduul gives you much more interesting stuff to work with.
JP – How long you working on the Vanduul Scythe?
GH – I think now it's been about two weeks?
JP – Two weeks? And did you get brought on by other people, did they kind of bring you together as a team?
GH – Yeah sort of, we'll kind of hop back and forth on things because we'll have multiple things in the pipeline, so, basically I'll be working on one thing and then somebody finishes up their thing for the Scythe, they can hand it off, I can take over that, and hand it off, and we just go back and forth till it works.
JP – So as you're gearing towards the end of the Scythe and as we're trying to finish that up, where do you see your little touches or if you do at all?
GH – Really it'd be in the design of the internal structure, which I would like to be proud of, but it's just the first pass, so concept has been going down the pipe for new internals, like a fleshed out structure, so that'll take over what I'm doing, but right now this'll lay the base for what's going in.
JP – Was it exciting to kind of get to set how the internals of a Vanduul ship would look?
GH – It was, it was fun to figure out, to try and figure out what would be different, but I was kind of limited because I had to use assets from the previous damages, which were human, so I had to sort of distort those in a way.
JP – So that's interesting. You had to take damages from the human ships and kind of adapt them?
GH – I had to work with all those old textures and materials and stuff like that, without creating new ones, to keep it efficient. So it was a challenge.
JP – I imagine that you change some of them a little bit because it's so organic like and it's a different ship, it has to break different right?
GH – And there was a lot of discussion about completely redoing the way Vanduul materials work, and the way they would build their structures, maybe a more cellular design, but we couldn't really do that in this early stage so… later it'll probably come.
JP – That'd be interesting, if instead of things breaking apart they just kind of dent in and it feels more like you're being bruised instead of broken, but…
GH – That would be totally possible but… not yet.
JP – Well, thanks so much for coming on thanks for taking the time to come talk to us, and we're all really excited to see the Scythe and the other Vanduul ships.
GH – I am too.
JP – Alright, back to you Ben!

Zane Bien
Hi my name is Zane, I'm a UI designer here at CIG, and today I want to take you through my design process in creating the Vanduul UI. It's a cool little project I did to make the Vanduul ships and while you're flying it feel very unique and alien, so lets dive into it.
The goal with this is I wanted to try to make the UI, the shape language of the UI, a very aggressive shape. WHen you look at it is feels very organic and you have these aggressive shapes. What I did here was to kind of make everything kind of flow into the center of the HUD, so you have all of these different pointy spiky crazy shapes all going into the center, as if it's targeting on to something and focusing on a specific point. So you try to get these kinds of nice, sharp, almost tribal shapes with the Vanduul, cause that's something that Chris likes with the Vanduul language at least is kind of the tribal look, the tribal feel to it.
With these elements up here you can see they're repeating, I tried to take some of the cues from some of the ships where you have a lot of repeating shape to them and tried to bring that into the UI somewhat. I think it compliments it pretty well.
So in this particular design here we have two components that I'm displaying simultaneously. One component is the visor, and this is kind of the elements on the outer edges, and the center here will be mapped to the physical fixed HUD in the cockpit.
What I considered when designing this is that this actually isn't going to be shown all the time. What's going to happen is that the UI will boot in when you get into the Vanduul ship, then it will glitch out to the Human UI, so you're not going to see this design all the time when you're flying.
I wanted to be a little more gratuitous with how much screen real estate that this UI takes up. I wasn't too worried about how cluttered, or how much it's going to impede on your vision, because it's only going to be there in specific events, like boot-up, as well as when you get hit. And when you get hit it's actually going to glitch out a bit.
So I wanted to get these ships, make it very obvious, so when you get hit you can actually sort of see it, you know, see some of the alien UI fighting through when your ship gets hit and your computer gets damaged.
So I think it's going to be cool.
I hope you guys enjoyed this short deep dive (extended video coming soon™ ) into the Vanduul UI. I'll be working on the Merlin next, and all the rest of the ship UI's and displays.
My name is Zane Bien, I'm a UI designer at CIG, signing off.

Last year in Los Angeles, a mysterious cult began recruiting people through emails, phone calls, and one-on-one consultations. For nine months individuals were drawn into the group's web of intrigue, discovering that a young woman from Ohio had been taken in and brainwashed. In September, the cult finally opened its doors, and people had the chance to walk its halls and try to find the young woman inside — or die trying.
The only thing was, none of it was real.
The Tension Experience represented a key moment in the evolution of immersive entertainment. Combining alternate reality gaming, haunted house techniques, and a two-hour immersive theater show, it created what essentially amounted to a mini-Westworld: a persistent, fictional universe where the participant's choices determined what happened next, and the line between reality and fantasy became so blurred it barely even existed at all.
At this year's SXSW conference, I moderated a panel with the show's creators: director Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw II-IV), writer Clint Sears, producer Gordon Bijelonic, and actress Sabrina Kern. During Horror's Immersive Future: The Tension Experience, we discussed the evolution of the show, the ramifications for experiential storytelling, and how mediums like immersive theater and virtual reality can impact audiences emotionally in ways that film and television simply can't.
It's exactly what you'd expect from a show that put hoods over people's heads, kidnapped them, and asked them to kill other characters on-screen.

"Since I am the guy that made the initial Cortana on Android/iOS comments, I thought it would be good to jump in. And for those who wondered, yes people at Microsoft read these forums and comments because we care what our customers are saying.
First, as many commenters have pointed out, we have a lot of work left to do to make Cortana awesome on Windows Phone. We are in Beta and we are in the US and we know before we do anything else we need to scale and get Cortana out to more customers. This is our absolute top priority. This means actually launching Windows Phone 8.1 to our broad consumer audience through new phones and official updates. And getting Cortana to more countries as quickly as we can. What is being left out of the recap from these talks is that before the questions about Cortana on Android/iOS, we spent time talking about how important it is to get to more countries. Half of our customers in the Developer Preview are from outside of the US. That is amazing and is a testament to the strength of our community and the fact that we built something interesting.
Our top priority and showcase device for Cortana is Windows Phone. Any discussion or commentary about us giving up or abandoning Windows Phone is crazy talk. Our top priority is to make Cortana so fantastic that it pulls customers to Windows Phone. Period. No debate, no controversy, no throwing in the towel on our current Windows Phone customers or potential future Windows Phone customers.
After we push crazy talk about abandoning Windows Phone to the side, we have started THINKING about what's next for Cortana. And again, this is about planning and thinking and wrestling with questions about what the future will bring AFTER we make Cortana awesome for Windows Phone customers around the world. Our product design and engineering resources are being applied to making Cortana awesome for Windows Phone. So what's next is about thinking and planning, not a statement of anything we are committing to do. And unfortunately none of us have a crystal ball so this is where we will be patient, see what is happening with our customers, talk to our community and do what we think will make the most sense for innovating through products that Microsoft customers use.
We are actively thinking about what it takes to expand Cortana to Windows devices. Nothing official to report but we want our Windows device customers to experience Cortana at some point in the future. And we want the experience to be fantastic which means you have to start thinking about how Cortana should work across multiple devices. Working fantastic and being the best end-to-end experience for customers that have all Microsoft devices will be the natural first step. Our ideal future state is going to be that a customer that has a Windows PC, Windows Tablet and Windows Phone has the absolute best Cortana experience. Period. Again no debate, no controversy.
As we THINK (again, this is about thinking, refer to the above about Windows Phone about what we have committed to DO where my team is spending design and engineering time) about the future, we want to figure out what we need to do so that a Microsoft customer who has a PC/tablet but a different phone can have a great Cortana experience. We THINK we will have lots of customers on PC/Tablet in this future state that haven't seen the light and come over to Windows Phone. And we want these customers to have a great experience because if they do and we show them an even better experience on Windows Phone, there is a better chance of having them to switch to Windows Phone. If they have a bad experience on a PC/Tablet, there is no chance they will consider Windows Phone. Like it or not (I have worked on Windows Mobile and Windows Phone for 10 years so I hate hate hate it...) we are a challenger in the mobile space. This means we need to consider ideas and alternatives to breakthrough and be flexible and adaptable based on what we learn as Cortana comes to Windows Phone customers. But to be 100% clear, this is only AFTER we build something so incredible that scales to more countries on Windows Phone (where we are spending our engineering/product time) AND we make it available to even more customers that have a set of Windows devices (which is where we are just beginning to figure out our approach.)
On behalf of my team, we love the passion of our Windows Phone community. You have done an amazing job of supporting us in the early days of Cortana and it gives us motivation to continue to build something great for you. There is no substitute for action so watch the next four months and you will see that we are dead serious about giving you the best personal assistant on any Smartphone, something so great that you will convince everyone you know to get a Windows Phone. And if that happens, then we can stop early future speculative talk about Android/iOS :)
Thanks again for engaging in a dialog.

Former LSU coach Les Miles and University of Houston are interested in getting together for the head coaching job vacated when Tom Herman left for Texas, according to a university official.
Houston Chronicle beat writer Joseph Duarte quoted Houston Board of Regent Tilman J. Fertitta in a tweet saying "we have interest in him and he has interest in us."
In another Duarte tweet, Fertitta is quoted as saying Miles "is on the list."
Fertitta said the school wants to make a hire as soon as possible and perhaps by next week.
Miles was fired by LSU on Sept. 25 after going 2-2 in the season's first month. His name has also popped up in relation to openings at Purdue and Baylor.
LSU is paying a buyout of $9.6 million to Miles in monthly installments over six years -- twice the amount of time remaining on the contract, which expires Dec. 31, 2019. That amount will be offset by whatever Miles is paid in his new job.
Russian officials say it is too soon to say when an oil-for-goods arrangement with Iran will start, despite earlier reports that Moscow had already begun delivering on the deal.
The deal could help Moscow, which faces Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis, by strengthening its foothold in Iran. But there is no agreement yet between Tehran and world powers on Iran's nuclear program that would relax sanctions on the Islamic republic.
Russia's food-safety regulator said on June 8 that grain sales to Iran had begun, RIA news agency reported, though the regulator later backed off that claim.
Iran's Fars news agency, moreover, quoted Iran's oil minister on June 6 as saying Russia would begin oil imports from Tehran this week.
But the Russian Energy Ministry later said it was too early to talk about starting the deal.
Russia hopes to act as an intermediary selling oil for Iran under the swap arrangement, which Iran's ambassador to Moscow estimated was worth $70 billion.
Based on reporting by Reuters and TASS
NORFOLK, Va. – Theresa Pusateri has been named the Director of Basketball Operations for the Old Dominion University women's basketball team, as announced by head coach Karen Barefoot on Friday.
Pusateri will oversee day to day operations for the women's basketball program which include team travel, marketing, fundraising, community service, player personnel and summer camps.
"Theresa will assist in all phases of the administrative responsibilities of our women's basketball program,” exclaimed Barefoot. “She will do a great job in this position because she has a high level of energy, an impressive skill set and an incredible work ethic. We are excited to have her join our Lady Monarch family."
Pusateri comes to ODU after serving the last three years as an Assistant to the Athletic Program and Coach (basketball, field hockey and softball) at Rye High/Middle School.
“I am extremely honored to join such a talented women's basketball staff at ODU,” said Pusateri. “Coach Barefoot is a proven winner and has elevated this program to another level in just three short years. I look forward to making a positive difference with the student athletes, the University, the fans and most importantly the community.”
Prior to moving to Rye, N.Y., Pusateri was an Executive Assistant for Nancy Lieberman Enterprises and Camp Director for Nancy Lieberman's Basketball Camps/Clinics from May 2007 to August 2011. From 2010-11, Head Coach Nancy Lieberman appointed Pusateri as the Executive Assistant of the Texas Legends, a National Basketball Association Development Team.
Nancy Lieberman discussed ODU's most recent hire, "Theresa was a Monarch long before she became a Monarch. When she worked with me, she knew about the history of our esteemed University. She's the right woman for the right job. I'm glad she's in the Lady Monarch family."
Before Pusateri's stint in the NBA D-League, she was a Graduate Assistant for the Michigan State University women's basketball team under head coach Joanne P. McCallie, where Pusateri obtained her Mater of Science Degree in Kinesiology with an emphasis in Sports Administration and Coaching in the May of 2007. Pusateri also attained her Bachelor of Arts Degree with a concentration in Communication in East Lansing, Mich. at MSU.
While at Michigan State, Pusateri was three-sport varsity athlete (field hockey, basketball and softball). She was a member of the field hockey team from 2000-2004, when the team compiled 67 wins, one Final Four run and two Big Ten Regular Season/Tournament titles. Pusateri played on the basketball team from 2002-2005, as the Spartans made it to the NCAA Tournament's First Round in 2002 and then Second Round in 2003. Pusateri was also a member of the MSU softball team for the 2000-01 season.
Joanne P. McCallie (who coached Pusateri at Michigan State and is currently the head coach at Duke University) talked about the Lady Monarch's newest addition, “I am thrilled for Theresa to become a part of the outstanding Old Dominion program. Theresa's enthusiasm, work ethic and overall positive spirit will bring even more energy to ODU women's basketball. Coach Barefoot is a phenomenal coach and role model for which Theresa will benefit greatly.”
The department's Force Review Board found the two officers used proper tactics and decision-making, followed their training and did not violate policies, according to sources.
The Seattle Police Department's Force Review Board has found the fatal shooting of Charleena Lyles by two officers in June to be reasonable, proportional and within policy, according to sources familiar with the decision.
The board's unanimous vote occurred during a meeting Tuesday that began at 9 a.m. and lasted until about 5 p.m., said one source with direct knowledge of the proceeding.
The findings are subject to final approval from Assistant Chief Lesley Cordner, who presided over the meeting and oversees the department's Compliance and Professional Standards Bureau, the source said.
Corey Guilmette, an attorney representing Lyles' family, issued a statement Wednesday night, saying, “We cannot accept that Charleena Lyles' killing was unavoidable. If her killing was within policy and training, we need changes in policy and training.”
Lyles, a 30-year-old African-American mother of four, was shot seven times by Officers Steven McNew and Jason Anderson on June 18 after she called 911 to report a burglary at her Northeast Seattle apartment. Police said Lyles suddenly threatened the officers inside the apartment with one or two knives before they opened fire.
The officers found no evidence of a burglary, according to police.
Lyles had struggled with mental-health issues, according to her family and court records, and the shooting came at a time her life was spinning out of control.
The shooting unleashed a storm of public protest, with many seeing it as another example of unnecessary deadly force being used by police against people of color. Lyles' family members have said they believe race was a factor. The officers who shot her are white.
The Force Review Board was created as part of a 2012 consent decree between the city and the U.S. Justice Department to address excessive force and biased policing in the Police Department. It replaced the Firearms Review Board, which had been criticized over the depth of its work.
In Tuesday's review, the board, consisting of about 15 members of the department, found the officers used proper tactics and decision-making, followed their training and did not violate policies regarding de-escalation and crisis-intervention training, according to the sources.
The findings will be documented in a written report, which will articulate the basis for the conclusions.
In reaching its conclusions, the board considered statements from the two officers taken shortly after the shooting. The statements, contained in 86 pages of transcripts of recorded interviews, were released by police days after the shooting.
Anderson told investigators Lyles was speaking calmly with the officers when she suddenly pulled a knife out of her pocket and was “coming right at my stomach.” He said he jumped back and sucked in his abdomen to avoid getting stabbed in the stomach with a knife 4 to 5 inches long.
Anderson said he drew his pistol, asked for fast backup on his radio and, along with McNew, told Lyles to “get back.”
Anderson said McNew asked him to use his Taser on Lyles, but he told McNew he didn't have a Taser. He acknowledged he failed to report to his superiors that he was no longer carrying a Taser — the lack of notification a possible violation of department policy.
Lyles then began quickly advancing on McNew, Anderson said, describing himself as in “fear that she was gonna try and kill my partner um 'cause she was going after him.”
As Lyles turned a corner to go after McNew, Anderson said, he fired from 4 to 5 feet away and saw Lyles fall to the floor.
McNew, who carried a baton but didn't have a Taser, said in his statement that he fired his handgun because he felt like he didn't have any other options
Anderson said he wasn't carrying a Taser because the battery had died two weeks earlier, but he told investigators he wouldn't have used it anyway because he was trained to use lethal force when attacked with a knife.
Anderson said he was the first officer called to the scene, and asked for a second officer after discovering there was an officer-safety caution on Lyles stemming from a June 5 domestic-disturbance incident. In that case, Lyles threatened the officers with a pair of long scissors before dropping them.
But Anderson said there was no need to frisk Lyles in the June 18 incident because it was a typical burglary call.
He said Lyles' demeanor had changed so quickly he did not have time to employ de-escalation techniques.
McNew said he considered running out of the apartment, but he couldn't because Lyles was visibly agitated, holding two knives, with her children at her feet.
The Police Department's Office of Police Accountability, which conducts internal investigations, is looking into whether Anderson's actions regarding his Taser violated department policy.
A separate inquest has been set for April 16, in which a jury will determine the causes and circumstances of the shooting, followed by King County Prosecutor Dan Satterberg's decision whether to file criminal charges against the officers.

Atul Kumar Babubhai Patel was detained at the airport by ICE officials for not possessing necessary immigration documents while entering US.
According to an ICE statement, Patel had entered US through Ecuador and was initially detained by US Customs and Border Protection and was shifted to the Atlanta City Detention Center where he received an initial medical screening and was identified to have high blood pressure and diabetes.

A Limerick man who attempted to travel to Iraq to fight the Islamic State (Isis) was detained by airport security in London before his flight was due to depart.
David Hayes was due to fly to Turkey last week and then on to an Assyrian base near Mosul, Iraq, where he intended on taking up arms in the fight against Islamic State.
The 39-year-old from Kileely – which is near Thomond Park – has been left “disheartened” after being detained by anti-terrorism police in Gatwick Airport, who said that, despite his “honourable intentions”, they could not permit him to travel.
He was detained for several hours at the airport, where he was questioned by plainclothes airport police.
“I've been observing what Isis are doing in Syria and Iraq and throughout the world,” said the Limerick man who intended to join the Assyrian militia Dwekh Nawsha – a Christian military group created two years ago to fight Isis.
Mr Hayes claimed he decided to take action after he saw a disturbing photograph of a child who had been killed by Islamic State. “When I saw that, something in my heart just said I have to do something. I felt morally obligated to not just be a casual observer and have an opinion on Facebook about it, but to actually volunteer.
Survival
A descendant of John Devoy – who took part in the Fenian rising in 1867, the 1916 Rising and the War of Independence – Mr Hayes likens his cause to that of the Irish rebels.
“The most vile organisation ever to spring up in mankind's history, in my opinion, is Isis. And the Assyrians are fighting for their survival. So I believe that I'm representing Ireland as well.
“I have to commit to four months, you're asked to commit to three months,” he said before he flew to London. “You can't just land as a volunteer and after two weeks decide you're out, that it's not for you. I'm a little bit scared, yes. I'm a little bit nervous, but I feel duty bound to go ahead and do it.”
Although stopped from travelling this time, he remains hopeful he will join the militia.
“I haven't given up in regards to Isis or any grouping that threatens our way of life and who oppress and murder others.”
Where's the shock and awe?
The ruble plunged 3.8% on Wednesday and another 2.8 on Thursday to a new all-time low of 83.85 to the dollar, at 5:30 PM Moscow time, blowing through the previous catastrophic panic low of December 2014. At the time, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank deployed desperate, and ultimately very costly shock-and-awe measures to stop the ruble from spiraling out of control. And it triggered all kinds of drama.
On December 16, 2014, the Central Bank announced that it increased its benchmark rate by a brutal 6.5 percentage points to a dizzying 17%, after having already jacked up rates in the prior week to 10.5%. And the Ministry of Finance announced it would begin selling Russia's crown jewels, its dwindling foreign currency reserves, and with the proceeds mop up rubles.
It seemed to put a floor under the ruble for a few blinks of an eye, but then the ruble crashed 20% in no time, hitting 80 rubles to the dollar for a few moments, and it was going to be the end of the world, but then the ruble reversed course and spiked higher.
Today, there's no such drama. The ruble is now lower than it had ever been. It has plunged 26% against the dollar in just three months. It's also down 25% against the euro, 27% against the yen, and 23% against the yuan. This is an all-out ruble crash, not a “strong dollar” problem.
And it's down 63% against the dollar since early 2013. Back then, it took 29 rubles to buy a dollar. It took 62 rubles three months ago. It takes nearly 84 rubles now:
But there were no big announcements and no shock-and-awe moments. Instead, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank sat on their hands and let it happen. But Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina did show up on TV in an interview to soothe her compatriots' rattled nerves. After all, it was their money that was getting destroyed, and she owed them a few mollifying words.
The ruble is close to its “fundamental levels,” she said. “We will intervene only if we see risks to financial stability. There aren't such risks now.”
The ruble doesn't matter, it seems. She's talking about the banks. Some of them already got bailed out. During the ruble crash in December 2014, it was National Bank Trust, which had been toppled by panic buying of foreign currency and a surge in deposit withdrawals. The state-owned Deposit Insurance Agency took over the bank with funds provided by the Central Bank.
No one wants to see another bank topple. But that bailout was likely a lot cheaper than propping up the ruble for months or years. It's easy to run down a currency. It's expensive to prop it up after it started crashing.
So they won't intervene. Let the ruble go where it wants. Russia has too many other problems. The foreign currency reserves could be used for more useful things than propping up the ruble for a little while. And hiking interest rates brutally, like last time, would be suicidal for the economy.
During the three months that the ruble plunged 26%, the price of Brent oil plunged 40%. This ongoing collapse of oil along with the decline of the price of natural gas in Russia's key markets has whacked the economy. The sanctions haven't exactly helped. The national budget, which relies to a large extent on oil and gas revenues, is on the chopping block. The economy shrank for five quarters straight, and more shrinkage is expected in Q4.
In its World Economic Outlook, released on Tuesday, the IMF estimates that Russia, “which continues to adjust to low oil prices and Western sanctions,” is going to remain in recession in 2016. It estimates that GDP fell 3.7% in 2015 year-over-year and is going to fall another 1% in 2016. That would be 2.5 years straight of recession!
But the IMF is always optimistic in its economic projections, and as reality gets closer it adjusts its views downward. For instance, in its World Economic Outlook released six months ago, the IMF estimated that the economy would shrink 3.4% in 2015 and grow 0.2% in 2016. So its current projection of a 1% GDP decline in 2016 may well be a rosy scenario.
Inflation was 12.9% in December. Russian consumers are groaning. But the swooning ruble means that imported consumer goods, and that's a lot of them, will get even more expensive for them. Hence, inflation will get worse. A deep, long recession even as inflation is raging is a toxic mix.
To repress inflation, the Central Bank would normally jack up rates at every meeting. And to prop up the ruble, it would normally raise rates unexpectedly. Shock and awe! But the Russian economy can hardly digest shock-and-awe measures.
The benchmark one-week repo rate has been at 11% since August. At the last meeting on December 11, the Central Bank indicated it might cut rates at the next meetings (one is coming up on January 29) if inflation softens in line with forecasts.
Those forecasts have been obviated by events. Now the ruble is plunging, and inflation might take a big jump. Given these risks, First Deputy Governor Yudaeva already said she couldn't “completely” rule out a rate increase.
But higher rates would be bad for the deeply troubled economy. So far they're sitting on their hands, mumbling under their breath that there can't be any shock-and-awe interest-rate hikes to prop up the ruble, and that the foreign exchange reserves are too valuable and scarce to blow on the ruble, and that the overall economy was more important than the currency or inflation, and so it seems, they're saying, to heck with the ruble. Let it go. And the market has gotten the message.
Perhaps it is this sort of scenario that is worrying the Bank of Canada. The fear of “currency instability” is now cropping up in Canada after the loonie has plunged 33% in two years against the US dollar. Read… Canada Rebels against the Destruction of the Loonie

Image copyright AP Image caption IS has lost much territory since its gains in 2014 sent shockwaves around the world
At least 50,000 militants from so-called Islamic State have been killed since the US-led coalition started fighting in Iraq and Syria two years ago, a US military official has said.
The senior official described the figure as a "conservative estimate".
The figure showed air power and a small number of US figures supporting local forces were having an impact, the official said.
The US has, however, repeatedly warned that IS can replace fighters rapidly.
The official on Thursday said that coalition air strikes could be intensified in places like Mosul, which Iraqi troops are now battling to recapture, but that had to be offset against the risk of civilian casualties.
The campaign was beginning to damage IS, the official said.
"I am not into morbid counts but that kind of volume matters, that kind of impact on the enemy."

The US has often been reluctant to provide figures on enemy casualties.
But in August, Lt Gen Sean MacFarland was quoted by the AP news agency as saying that about 45,000 enemy combatants had been killed.
In February, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said IS had about 25,000 fighters operating in Syria and Iraq, citing a US intelligence estimate.
IS has lost a lot of ground since it reached the high tide of its expansion in 2014, and is now under fire from Russian, Turkish, Iraqi, Syrian and Kurdish forces, as well as US and British air power.
It is now entrenched in Mosul and Raqqa and the Sunni Arab tribal heartland of the Euphrates river valley, which stretches from eastern Syria to western Iraq.
New security and surveillance measures brought in after the Charlie Hebdo attack have yet to make a significant impact
France's intelligence services are facing intense scrutiny over whether they could have prevented the Paris attacks, but their defenders argue the scale and complexity of the jihadi threat has simply overwhelmed the country's defences.
According to Yves Trotignon, a former counter-terrorism official in the French external service, DGSE, the security services had long feared such an event. They used the terrorist assault on Mumbai in November 2008 as their model, an invasion of a crowded public building by gunmen determined to kill as many people as possible in a short time.

Being prepared for such an attack scarcely makes it any easier to stop, however, given the vast number of potential targets.
“It is extremely difficult to defend against such an attack once it has begun to be executed,” Trotignon said. “We have seen that not only in Mumbai, but also in Nairobi and Peshawar.”
“It is hard to qualify yesterday evening's events as a success for the intelligence agencies,” said Trotignon, now an adviser at Risk & Co, an engineering and risk assessment consultancy. “But until we know more about the organisation of the attack and its authors it's impossible to blame this or that service.”
The Paris atrocity comes after a security services thwarted a series of attempted attacks by Islamic militants in France in recent months. They successfully uncovered at least six plots, but many senior French officials appear to have been deeply worried by the accelerating tempo of operations in their country and the growing involvement of French citizens in violent activities at home and abroad.
“We have now become the Islamic State's enemy number one,” Marc Trevidic, France's outgoing examining magistrate in counter-terrorism cases, said shortly before the Paris attacks. “France is the principal target for an army of terrorists of unlimited means. Furthermore it's also clear that we are particularly vulnerable because of our geographical position, for the ease of entrance on to our territory for jihadists of European origin.”
Paris attacks: Syrian who passed through Greece on refugee route one of Isis killers – live Read more
Trevidic told Paris Match: “Our darkest days are ahead of us. The real war that Isis intends to wage on our soil has not yet begun.”
The French president, François Hollande, speaking after the attempted shooting by a gunman on a Thalys train to Brussels in August, said the nation needed to prepare itself for further terrorist strikes.
Since the shootings at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in January – France's worst terrorist attack for decades – a range of measures have been brought in to reinforce the security services. French counter-terrorism units have been reorganised with a new joint headquarters under the minister of the interior and new powers of surveillance. The measures, however, have yet to make any significant impact. About 2,000 new posts created are still in the process of being filled.
The reinforcements are primarily aimed at allowing intelligence services to watch more individuals suspected of involvement in extremist activities, an acknowledgement that they were previously under-resourced. Surveillance on key figures involved in the Charlie Hebdo attacks ended shortly before they appear to have started planning their attacks, and redirected towards suspects involved with networks linked to Syria and Iraq. More than 1,500 French citizens are believed to have travelled to one of the two countries, and about 250 returned. A database of suspect individuals has more than 11,000 names on it. Le Monde described services as overrun by the demands placed upon them.
Paris terror attacks: Hollande says Isis atrocity was 'act of war' Read more
The new counter-terrorism measures in June were intended to increase surveillance capacity, but Trotignon questions the effectiveness of doing so without an organisational overhaul of the intelligence services so that the flow of information can be properly assessed and real threats identified. The perpetrators of several recent attacks in Europe have been known to the intelligence services, he said, but that had not enabled them to stop them.
The possibility that plots uncovered by security services in recent months may include at least one targeting concert halls will increase pressure on officials to explain how they failed to stop the latest attacks.
A man suspected of planning an attack on an entertainment venue was arrested in Paris in August. He had spent only six days in Syria before being wounded in the leg during fighting, L'Express Magazine reported.
A commander from Islamic State in the city of Raqqa had told him to conduct attacks in Europe, not only in France, and had indicated concert halls as possible targets, police sources said at the time.
One reason for the absence of attacks in France in the decade after 9/11was the efficacy of intelligence services that had been quicker than their counterparts elsewhere in developing an understanding of the real nature of the threat posed by Islamic militancy. The experience of the 1990s, and the nature of French policing more generally, also meant the country's security services already had legal powers of arrest and detention that were far greater than those of their counterparts in other European countries.
A further reason for the lack of violence in France was the success of its political class in distancing the country from the US-led war on terror and its almost universal opposition to the war in Iraq.
Those defensive advantages, however, have now evaporated. “We can't close our eyes to it,” Trevidic said. “We are now in the eye of the hurricane. The worst is yet to come.”
Facebook is testing a new feature called “Saved Replies,” which will allow business Page owners the ability to write, save and then re-use canned messages when communicating with their customers over Facebook. The addition will save businesses time when handling incoming customer service inquires and responding to other customer feedback via the site.
The feature, which is available now to a select group of business owners via the messaging interface on Facebook Pages, offers a simple tool that lets a Page admin create a new reply, save it for later use, and even search through their list of replies to find the one they need. This latter option is especially helpful for those who have a longer list of replies and don't want to scroll to find each one.
Businesses are initially offered a couple of sample replies they can use out-of-the-box or customize, we're told, or they can simply create their own. After set up is complete, to use a saved reply, you just click on it from the list and it automatically appears in the body of the email. You can also access the option from the messages reply box, where a new option lets you click a small icon to respond with a Saved Response.
Above: a Page owner's Saved Replies interface
Also handy is the fact that the replies themselves can be personalized using auto-populating placeholders similar to what you would use with form email messages, for example. There are personalization options that let you insert a person's first name or last name, the admin's first or last name as well as the website URL.
Saved Replies appears to be in limited testing right now, as one of the businesses with access to the option tells us that they were not informed by Facebook of the feature's launch. Instead, when they opened up an email to craft a reply to a custom, the option just appeared. Several other Page admins we spoke with report that they don't yet see this available on their Pages.
It's not unusual for Facebook to test a new feature with a smaller group of users before a larger, public rollout, of course.
[gallery ids="1166210,1166211,1166212,1166213"]
Saved Replies was first spotted by the blog MyTechSkool, as well as several others posting about it on social media, including Twitter. We've asked Facebook for additional details surrounding the feature set and rollout of Saved Replies, and will update if the company responds. Some Page admins say they don't yet see the option on mobile, but that could be due to how new it is, at present.
While larger businesses today may utilize professional helpdesk platforms like Zendesk or Freshdesk to handle customer service messages initiated via Facebook, the new Saved Replies feature will likely be of more use to smaller businesses, including startups, home businesses, and mom-and-pop shops, who today often keep a list of standard replies they copy-and-paste into messages.
Over the years, Facebook has been slowly ramping up its community management and Page management tools for business users, helping them save time by automating tasks that would have otherwise involved more manual efforts. For instance, years ago, Facebook introduced a keyword moderation blocklist feature for Page owners, which helped them reduce the time it took to fight spam as well as moderate and remove other unwanted (e.g. profane, offensive, etc.) comments.

When people ask me what I miss most as a vegan, my first answer is always "not being asked that question all the time."
My second answer isn't a specific food so much as it is the concept of convenience, the ability to grab something quickly while on the go in between bars in New York City when you just need a quick sustenance boost or just something to sponge up the alcohol. And pizza is, of course, the king of convenience food, especially in New York, where a hot slice is the perfect option: fast, cheap, portable, and, unequivocally, the best in the world.
Vegan pizza has long been relegated to dine-in options at the first wave of hippie-ish, more health-focused vegan restaurants—where it's hardly resembled pizza at all—or more recently has appeared in the frozen food aisle topped with a plasticky simulacrum of mock cheeses that best emulate low-end supermarket mozzarella. Until recently, it has never come close to replicating the greasy simplicity of the corner slice joint, but that has changed drastically in the past year.
The golden age of vegan pizza has arrived in New York City, and it both reflects a sea change in vegan cuisine's self-image and brings meat- and dairy-free eating further into the mainstream.

"Fifteen years ago, we all would think a vegan pizzeria would close because it wouldn't have enough business," said Mark Mebus, co-owner of Screamer's, the city's first all-vegan slice joint, which opened in Greenpoint in June. "You can't just do that without there being a rise in public demand."
The new wave of veganism in the NYC food scene seems to come with a resolute insistence that anything can be made from plants, from the creations of the the Cinnamon Snail at the Pennsy food hall, which offers "Nutella" stuffed poptarts, to the New York-style bagels with carrot "lox" and cashew cream cheese at Orchard Street Grocers. And these vegan versions of classics come with the sort of high-end flair, attention to ingredients, and ingenuity found in the more traditional echelons of New York dining, which has historically looked down on the city's vegan restaurants as niche—for punky bike messengers and health nuts only.
RECIPE: Vegan Cauliflower Crust Pizza
This attitude is also one that's stirred some controversy in New York's protective pizza parthenon: If a pizza isn't covered in mozzarella, is it even really a pizza?
In addition to Screamer's, in the past year alone, Double Zero, a plant-based sit-down restaurant from vegan celebrity chef Matthew Kenney, opened in the East Village; Sizzle Pie, a heavy metal-themed Portland chain that offers a vast selection of vegan slices and a homemade vegan ranch dipping sauce, opened two locations in Brooklyn; and Paulie Gee's, the popular Greenpoint pizza shop with perhaps the most creative vegan side menu in town, started plans to open a slice joint with vegan options, too.

The unifying factor in these offerings is culinary creativity; it's less health food, and more tasty junk food that happens to be suitable for herbivores (and guilt-free for environmentalists). Unlike the spread of gluten-free options, vegan pizza requires less substitution—it's the same dough, after all—and comes with an ethical pat-on-the-back, not just a food allergy scorecard.
"The motivation is: Pizza is the most loved food in america, pretty much bar none," said Mebus, who's been vegan for 18 years for ethical reasons. "I thought that making that vegan would be the best advertisement for veganism."
"It is a quintessential part of the New York slice experience, the greasiness."
Screamer's opened in June with the ambitious goal of making the platonic ideal of pizza—the classic New York slice—without any animal products. It's a collaboration between Champs, the all-vegan diner in East Williamsburg, and Blackbird, a Philadelphia spot offering vegan pizza, cheesesteaks, and wings.
To up his game for New York, Mebus made the pizzas bigger than in Philly—20 inches, versus 18—and tweaked the dough recipe, fermenting it for 48 hours and adding semolina flour to give it an extra crispiness. Perhaps the biggest achievement, which I have yet to find elsewhere in my (extensive) research: The slices drip with greasiness, which takes me right back to the Jersey boardwalk pizzerias of my youth, a wad of napkins in hand to dab the glistening cheese. Mebus said that was on purpose: He added extra oil to the sauce.

"It is a quintessential part of the New York slice experience, the greasiness," he said. The menu contains some modified pizzeria classics like (seitan) pepperoni, as well as more creative options like Buffalo cauliflower, and uses NUMU cheese, a Brooklyn-made non-dairy alternative specifically created for pizzas, along with almond ricotta and "Parmesan."
But many pizza traditionalists and dairy addicts still scoff at the idea that plant-based foods could ever replace the standards. "If this is 'plant-based,' I'm switching to boil-in-bag," the New York Post's notoriously tetchy food critic Steve Cuozzo wrote last March when reviewing Double Zero.

Where does pizza philosophically begin and end? Is a white pie still pizza, since it has no red sauce? Is a ricotta-topped pizza an oxymoron, since it doesn't have mozzarella? Why can Chicago call deep-dish "pizza" such a thing, when it's (in my opinion) basically a tomato sauce-filled dumpster?
"I was definitely conscious of the challenge we were facing with going into the East Village, which is ground zero for good pizza," Kenney said of Double Zero, which offers $17 pies with toppings like shiitake bacon and macadamia ricotta. "I think there's a psychological hurdle we have to get through. It took years of overcoming skeptics and naysayers. But it's finally coming to fruition."

In fact, cheese only relatively recently became a mainstay of pizza recipes, said Scott Weiner, pizza historian and owner of Scott's Pizza Tours, which runs occasional vegan pizza tours. He notes that the earliest versions of the dish made in 16th-century Naples, Italy were generally for peasants and were topped with leftovers or whatever was seasonal, like pig fat or basil leaves, which is also discussed in the book Pizza: A Global History by Carol Helstosky. Cheese was treated as a topping rather than a given, and the thick layer of mozzarella that we've come to know didn't become a staple until the 19th century. That's when, as legend has it, Queen Margherita of Italy, tired of her usual cuisine, asked for pizzas to be prepared for her and declared the one that resembled the colors of the Italian flag, with mozzarella cheese, basil, and tomato, as the best. Marinara pizzas, which have no cheese, have been a staple of many respectable pizza menus for ages, Weiner added.
"Cheese was an afterthought," he put it. "Cheese wasn't the main event."
Paulie Gee is surprised more pizzerias haven't gotten on the bandwagon. His vegan menu debuted in 2010 and has been a hit, with options like cashew ricotta, green jackfruit meatballs, and the aforementioned NUMU cheese.
"The most important thing about my pizza is my crust," he said. "It's not that much different. The only thing that's different is the cheese."
At some old-school New York pizza places, however, you still won't see vegan cheese popping up on the menu soon.

"We don't make it," a manager at L&B Spumoni Gardens in Gravesend, Brooklyn, told me rather brusquely over the phone, although he said the owner has been asked to make vegan pies before. "He doesn't want to do it. He's happy with what he's doing."
Frank De Stefano, a manager at Sam's, an 87-year-old pizza shop in the Italian enclave of Cobble HIll, Brooklyn, said he wouldn't even know where to start with making a vegan pie.
"I don't eat vegan, I eat normal," he said. "I don't make it, the store don't make it."
Mebus, Kenney and others predict that plant-based cheese will continue to improve, and that vegan options will only spread from here, which means they're on track to be considered more "normal." But there has definitely never been a better time in New York City to grab a slice of which no animals were harmed in the making.
"I've had many customers say, 'This place allowed me to be vegan,'" Mebus said. "It's really the best thing people can say to me. Pizza is, like, the best thing in the world."
Boehner took to the conservative airwaves, appearing with Sean Hannity on Fox News to dispel what he said was “inaccurate information” circulating about the legislation.
“These are real cuts,” Boehner said.
“I'm not jumping up and down thrilled to death with this deal, but it was the best we could get,” he said earlier in the interview.
Rank-and-file House Republicans appeared to be coalescing around the agreement, but party leaders had to fend off criticism from Republican presidential hopeful Tim Pawlenty, who said Thursday the deal “should be rejected.”
“The more we learn about the budget deal, the worse it looks,” the former Minnesota governor said in a statement. “When you consider that the federal deficit in February alone was over $222 billion, to have actual cuts less than the $38 billion originally advertised is just not serious.”
Pawlenty's critique drew a chilly response from the party leadership.
“I think Tim Pawlenty and others are entitled to their opinion,” Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) told The Hill. “This is a deal the Speaker struck. It was the best deal he could strike given the fact he was dealing with the White House and the Senate.”
Asked if Pawlenty could swing Republican votes against the deal, Cantor said he wasn't sure of the former governor's intent. “Perhaps he wants to try and do that,” Cantor said. “What I can say is our members understand that what we've done is begin taking a first bite of the apple of dealing with the spending and debt crisis.”
In an implicit warning to other Republican presidential contenders, a senior House GOP aide brushed Pawlenty aside, telling The Hill that the candidate “would be considered a Blue Dog Democrat” in the 112th Congress.
“A real profile in courage from Governor Pawlenty-- who has no responsibilities but rattling off sound bites to appease the base,” the aide said. “In this Congress, Pawlenty would be considered a Blue Dog Democrat … that is, until he pretended to be something else.”
A spokesman for Boehner, Michael Steel, said in response to Pawlenty's critique: “The Speaker has always honored President Reagan's ‘11th commandment.' ” Reagan famously said he never spoke ill of fellow Republicans.
Republican leaders were faring better on Capitol Hill. The freshman class president, Rep. Austin Scott (Ga.), told The Hill he would support the budget deal, as did Rep. Kristi Noem (S.D.), a freshman representative on the leadership team.
“It's not that I'm not worried about them. And I would like to be all things to all people, but if you try to do that, you're nothing to anybody. So I'm more inclined to just vote yes and move this in the right direction,” said Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), a freshman lawmaker who's a favorite of Tea Party activists back in his home district.
The conservative grassroots movement says opposition to the budget deal, which was negotiated late last week by congressional leaders and the White House, has increased in recent days. The proposal cuts $39.9 billion from current spending levels, but Tea Party activists were encouraging GOP leaders to shut down the government in order to get higher cuts.
...“As much of a fiscal conservative as I am, you do have to accept the small victory sometimes before you get to the bigger victory,” said freshman Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.), who has taken some heat from Tea Party activists back in his home district.
“It's not something I worry about,” Grimm said of the potential for a primary challenge. “My job is to lead and to govern. If I wanted to just sit back and not be a member of Congress and just be a member of a Tea Party, well, then I can espouse whatever I want because there are no consequences.”
Grimm praised Tea Party activists in his home base on Staten Island as “very reasonable and rational,” but he added he would rather make progress “a little at a time” than simply oppose a measure because conservative activists are railing against it.
Boehner's office is claiming he has the votes in the bag to pass the budget deal he and Obama made. Recall, when they voted last Friday just after midnight on a temporary Band-Aid to keep the government from shutting down, 28 teabaggers and 42 progressives voted NO. It passed 348-70 . Grassroots teabaggers, who the far right has been winding up with "shut down the government" rhetoric for month, is furious, screaming for Boehner's head on a pike and babbling incoherently about primaries With the budget itself coming up for a vote, it's up to Boehner and Cantor to get it passed-- and Hoyer claims they haven't asked for help from the Democrats. So far two top House Democratic Leaders, Xavier Becerra and John Larson have committed-- to voting NO . Although Hoyer, as always, is expected to fall in line behind whatever the Establishment position is, Pelosi isn't saying what she's going to do. This is inconvenient for Boehner-Cantor-Ryan, Inc because it comes just as revelations are sweeping the right-wing paranoia underground that the reported $38.5 billion dollar cut was all smoke and mirrors and there weren't anything like the substantive cuts they feel they were promised-- like maybe just a paltry $352 million And that brings us to McCarthy's whipcount. Even as Marco Rubio was joining the other teabaggy senators in opposition, McCarthy says he has the votes in the House. Republicans who have already announced they will vote no include some of the craziest and most extremist press-whores, like Michele Bachmann (R-MN), Paul Broun (John Bircher Society) , Steve King (R-IA), Jim Jordan (R-OH), Ron Paul (R-TX), Mike Pence (R-IN) and Scott Garrett (R-NJ). Several Republicans looking to jump into higher offices by appealing to teabaggers-- Jason Chaffetz (UT), Dean Heller (NV) and Pence will all vote NO as well. In the Senate, 7 teabagger types are joining Bernie Sanders in opposition-- DeMint (R-SC), Ron Johnson (R-China), Mike Lee (R-UT), Rand Paul (R-KY), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Jim Risch (R-ID) and Diapers (R-LA).Many Republican freshmen elected with heavy teabagger support are now confident enough to follow Boehner-- who has made sure they are all being well taken care of by special interests lobbyists. They say they don't fear tea party primaries . Mike Kelly (PA) and Mike Grimm (NY) are two examples.Update after the vote today.

The FCC has never definitively settled the regulatory status of VoIP. If regarded as a telecommunications service -- instead of a less heavily regulated information service -- it would be subject to strict state rules. In this case, MPUC wants Charter to collect fees from customers to contribute to state programs that help the poor and hearing-impaired access telephone services, and to allow their customers to appeal to MPUC in the event of any disputes. Charter, with the support of the FCC, is trying to stop this, and the case has been taken to the Federal Court of Appeals which could, finally, provide clarification on VoIP's regulatory status.
Charter has found support from a number of other telecom companies, including AT&T, Verizon and USTelecom, which claim that preventing the utility regulation of VoIP promotes continued competition and ultimately benefits customers. Consumer groups, however, argue that a Charter victory would mark the loss of protection that guarantees universal access to basic telephone services at fair prices, and that VoIP service provision shouldn't come with fewer protections simply because it's provided in a different way to traditional landlines. The outcome of the case will undoubtedly set a precedent for VoIP regulation in other states, and as MPUC says in its brief on the matter, "This case presents an important question of nationwide significance: whether the rule of law may be rendered obsolete by technological innovation."

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday agreed to provide two large-sized patrol ships and lend up to five used surveillance aircraft to the Philippines, a Japanese government spokesman said, with both countries locked in territorial disputes with China. Abe and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte agreed in Vientiane to strengthen cooperation to ensure a peaceful resolution of the South China Sea dispute, Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Koichi Hagiuda said.
China claims most of the South China Sea, through which more than $5 trillion of trade moves annually. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have rival claims.
An arbitration court in The Hague in July invalidated China's claims to the waterway after a case was brought by the Philippines, a ruling that Beijing refuses to recognise.
Donald Trump attacked Hillary Clinton as an anti-American globalist in a major speech in New York Wednesday.
"Our country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people really first," he said. "We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism – focusing on what's good for America's middle class – to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy."
"This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats," he said. "This is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs."
"They totally own her," he said about foreign nations' influence over the Democratic frontrunner. "And that will never change."
Transcript via Politico:
DONALD TRUMP: Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001.
They totally own her, and that will never change.
The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to the total and complete control of people like the Clintons.
Those are the stakes. Hillary Clinton wants to be President. But she doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgement, to be president. She does not have the judgment. She believes she is entitled to the office.
Her campaign slogan is "I'm with her."
You know what my response to that is?
I'm with you: the American people.
She thinks it's all about her. I know it's all about you – I know it's all about Making America Great Again for All Americans. For All Americans.
Our country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people really first. We have to go back to putting our American people first.
We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism – focusing on what's good for America's middle class – to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy.
We reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed. They get punished!
This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats. This is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs.
We need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again.
That's what we mean by America First.
Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores.
Our Founders understood this. One of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for “the encouragement and protection of manufactur[ing]” in America.
Our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying: “The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.”
I have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton's disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization.
We've lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed.
Our trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton's time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned.
Then she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property – China has taken it -- a crime which is continuing to this day. Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself.
In return, Hillary Clinton got rich!

The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously on Tuesday to ban e-cigarette use at bars, nightclubs, restaurants and other public areas.
The ordinance also prohibits e-cigarettes, also known as "vaping," at farmers' markets, parks, recreational areas, beaches, indoor workplaces, outdoor dining areas and other places where tobacco smoking is restricted.
Vaping lounges and stores will be exempted from the ban, similar to exceptions made for cigar and hookah lounges under tobacco smoking regulations.
Council members voted 14-0 to approve the ordinance, which still needs Mayor Eric Garcetti's signature. With the vote, Los Angeles joins other big cities like New York and Chicago in placing restrictions on where you can use e-cigarettes.
A three-hour debate on the matter preceded the vote, with county health officials speaking about the health hazards of "vaping."
"We don't need to risk e-cigarettes undermining a half-century of successful tobacco control and perpetuating the 500,000 deaths that occur each year due to traditional cigarettes," said Dr. Jonathan Fielding of L.A. County Public Health.
Opponents say there is not enough data to determine if e-cigarettes are bad for you.
"If you force former smokers to go outside and have their e-cigarette, with all due respect, you will be held accountable for them going back to smoking," said Dr. Jeff Stire of the National Center for Public Policy Research.
Councilman Joe Buscaino presented an amendment to the ordinance that would have allowed an exemption for bars, but it failed on a 8-6 vote.
Garcetti is currently in Mexico, but he is expected to sign the ordinance. After he signs it, the ordinance goes into effect in 30 days.
In December, the City Council approved an ordinance that imposed tougher restrictions on e-cigarette retailers, prohibiting sales from mobile kiosks. Retailers must have a permit from the city to sell them.
E-cigarettes were introduced in 2007, and they have been largely unregulated because they don't burn tobacco. They vaporize liquid instead. It looks like smoke, but people are exhaling vapor that's typically infused with nicotine. Still, Los Angeles County health officials insist the vapor is dangerous.

Prof Avril Henry found dead days after police broke into her house following a tip-off from Interpol about the purchase
A retired academic is believed to have taken her own life using an illegally imported “euthanasia kit” a few days after police raided her property following a tip-off from Interpol.
Prof Avril Henry, 81, a member of the pro-euthanasia group Exit International, is said to have surrendered some of the drugs in her kit after police forced their way into her home – but kept half without officers realising.
Police were called back to her cottage in the village of Brampford Speke in Devon on Wednesday after she was discovered dead.
The Australian euthanasia campaigner Prof Philip Nitschke, who founded Exit International, spoke to Henry after the police raid and said she was furious at the intervention by Devon and Cornwall police.
He accused the force of being heavy-handed and said Exit International was warning other members of what has happened. Police have confirmed they visited Henry on Friday because of concerns over her welfare but refused to comment in detail. They will prepare a file for the coroner.
Nitschke said Henry, who was a professor of English medieval culture at the University of Exeter until 2000, had a series of illnesses and conditions including chronic ear infections and tinnitus, high blood pressure that led to cardiac and renal problems, swollen feet, incontinence and urinary infections.
He said: “She described her life as becoming a complete misery. She could not lift anything and was living an impossible existence. It got to the point she did not have a life she wanted to live.”
She had friends and was a popular figure in her village but had no known close family.
Nitschke added: “She had a formidable reputation as an academic of many years standing, but her health had drastically deteriorated. She had no one terminal illness but had a myriad of problems. She was pretty much housebound.”
She approached Nitschke about the possibility of travelling to Switzerland for an assisted suicide, but became too ill to travel. She was also said to be keen to die in her own beloved home and be buried in her orchard.
An ambulance crew was called to her property when police attended. A call incident report seen by the Guardian described it as a “very difficult situation”. It continued: “This lady has ordered an online suicide medication. The police have tracked the package to her house. This medication is in the house but can't be found.”

The report also says the police visit took place after Interpol in Manchester intercepted information about chemicals coming from Mexico.
Henry gave Nitschke a copy of a note she intended to leave, which he said she was happy to be published. It is dated Saturday 16 September. It said she was about to take the drugs, adding that the decision was her own and taken with the support of her family.
She described the law on suicide in the UK as illogical and cruel.
After the police visit Henry postponed her suicide, but Nitschke said she died earlier this week. He said: “Police need to realise that in the UK suicide is not a crime, and mental health authorities need to recognise that not everyone who seeks to end their lives is in need of psychiatric intervention.
“Her death was a clear case of ‘rational suicide' and her decision to die at her own time and in her own place should have been respected. As it is the authorities did everything they could to make her last days on this earth a misery.”
Nitschke said that in light of events in Exeter, Exit International would be contacting its 1,000-plus UK members warning them what had happened.
He said he had heard of another Exit member – a woman in her 70s from a different part of the UK – who reported that police had entered her house on the basis of information from Interpol. Drugs had been confiscated and she was due in court later this month.
Exit International is a not-for-profit Australian company that says it has an online membership of 18,000 supporters around the world.
It says the average age of Exit members is 75 years. A significant minority, it adds, are seriously ill.
Nitschke burned his medical practising certificate in November after a long-running fight with the Medical Board of Australia but said he would continue to advise terminally ill patients about how to take their lives.
Devon and Cornwall police refused to say if they had taken any drugs from Henry and declined to address complaints about how their officers had acted.
A spokesman said: “Devon and Cornwall police attended an address in Brampford Speke on 15 April following concerns for the welfare of a person within the property, and therefore entrance was forced.
“No criminal issues were highlighted during this incident and the matter was left in the hands of medical and mental health professionals.
“Police were called to the same address in Brampford Speke on 20 April following reports of a body of a woman in her 80s being discovered. This death isn't currently being treated as suspicious and a file is being prepared for the coroner.”
Neighbours described Henry as a “lovely” lady. Former dentist Geoffrey Langley, 77, said: “I have known her for quite a long time. She was a woman of strong views. She was on the parish council for many years and could be quite controversial.
“Sadly, she had not been in good physical health for a long while. but she was brave and determined to keep mobile.”
In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

Tank Noodle Shut Down Temporarily for Health Code Violations View Full Caption DNAinfo/Jen Sabella
UPTOWN — The popular Vietnamese restaurant Tank Noodle has been temporarily shut down by the Department of Public Health for much health code violations.
An inspection report dated Oct. 28 listed three "critical" violations among six total violations that included a problem with fruit flies, improperly stored food and a sewage problem.
"Inadequate waste water disposal," wrote the inspector, who also observed standing water in the kitchen, bathroom and front service area. To fix the problem, the restaurant needed to repair, clean and sanitize all infected areas.
The inspector also observed more than "50 live fruit flies in the front prep area and customer bathroom," which resulted in a "serious" violation that needed to be dealt with by providing "additional pest control services."
According to the report, Tank Noodle also kept dairy and meat products — eggs, beef, shrimp, pork meatballs, chicken and some sliced vegetables — at improper temperatures, resulting in a critical violation.
The report stated that management voluntarily threw out the improperly stored food, which was worth $500.
Cristina Villarreal, of the Department of Public Health, said Tank Noodle can reopen once it has made all corrections to critical violations.
Representatives of Tank Noodle could not be reached for comment Friday morning, but a recorded voice message on the restaurant's line said, "We will reopen Friday, October 31, 2014. See you soon."
The management team also posted a sign on the door that said, "We will reopen when our main sewage pipeline is fix. Thank you."

Why You Shouldn't Pre-order The Division's PC Version
In the past we've expressed how it's illogical to pre-order video games in this current generation, given that many launch with bugs and other assorted problems that are often fixed in patches, yet sometimes plague a game long after it's been released. This issue is less prevalent now than it was shortly following the launch of the PS4 and Xbox One, but some games continue to suffer from teething issues, with pre-ordering remaining a risky proposition.
This is especially the case when it comes to pre-ordering PC versions of console games, with there having been multiple examples of PC ports of games failing to measure up to their console counterparts. Now PC owners are hoping that this fate won't befall The Division, with the game's closed beta on the platform being overrun by cheaters giving themselves super speed and unlimited ammo.
The game's PvP Dark Zone is currently overrun by players abusing these cheats, though a Ubisoft spokesperson stated on the publisher's official forum that players aren't hacking the game, but abusing glitches instead. The Ubisoft employee wrote: “Guys, so you're aware the things discussed here are not in fact hacks or cheats, but merely abuse of glitches that exist in the game currently. These glitches are currently being worked on by the team.”
However, players have claimed that this cannot be the case, suggesting that they are a result of users' statistics being stored on the client side, meaning that hackers can change them and they push them online. This has led to players being able to pretty much become invincible, taking to the Dark Zone and giving everyone else a major headache, as you can see in the video below:
What with this being a beta, it is hoped that Ubisoft can rectify this issue before the game receives its full release in March. However, I'd strongly suggest that if you had pre-ordered the game on PC, you reconsider doing so and instead wait it out until the game is released and it is safely determined whether or not these crippling issues still plague it.
Aside from the mostly frivolous pre-order bonuses attached to games these days, there really is no benefit to laying your money on the line before a game has been launched. This is especially the case when it comes to games reliant upon their online component in order to succeed, and with so many developers failing to rectify the problems that are faced by their PC ports (Batman: Arkham Knight and Mortal Kombat X are two particularly egregious examples of this), PC gamers should naturally be wary of console ports released on the platform.
Ubisoft previously made a commitment to improving the quality of their PC ports, though stumbled with the shoddy PC version of 2014's Assassin's Creed: Unity. They did manage to pull out a successful port of its sequel Assassin's Creed: Syndicate, but players being able to completely ruin The Division‘s PvP experience should set alarm bells ringing, even if the game is in its beta stages.
Considering that Rainbow Six: Siege, Ubisoft's latest online-focused shooter, suffered from a poor netcode that punished players when going toe-to-toe with online rivals with high ping, those who were looking to purchase The Division on day one should also take this into consideration when trusting Ubisoft with handling a project as focused upon multiplayer as The Division.
Hopefully Ubisoft will have ironed out the issues plaguing The Division PC before the game launches on March 8th, but until then it's a good idea for PC owners to hold onto their money.

Russian President Vladimir Putin signed legislation this week that severely restricts freedom of religion by prohibiting any religious speech or evangelization outside of places of worship.
“This new situation resembles the Soviet Union in 1929. At that time confession of faith was permitted only in church,” said Dr. Hannu Haukka, president of Great Commission Media Ministries, reports National Religious Broadcasters (NRB). “Practically speaking, we are back in the same situation. These anti-terrorist laws are some of the most restrictive laws in post-Soviet history.”
The new law, which goes into effect July 20, is actually an amendment to a package of laws against terrorism and extremism approved by the Russian Parliament's upper chamber. As a result of the legislation, faith sharing in homes, in the media, online, or any place other than a government recognized church is prohibited.
The measure is expected to especially affect evangelical groups and Jehovah's Witnesses who often share faith in homes rather than traditional churches.
In a column at the Daily Signal, U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) wrote the new law is “an affront to free people everywhere.”
“We need to begin telling the truth about an increasingly aggressive actor in global affairs,” he said. “This Russian law would be an affront to free people everywhere—at home and abroad—who believe that rights of conscience—the rights to free speech and to freedom of religion—are pre-political.”
New Russian legislation would make it illegal for Christians to share their faith outside of a church. That's wrong.https://t.co/IvcTCsEigK — Senator Ben Sasse (@SenSasse) June 30, 2016
In Russia, we're witnessing a rising authoritarianism in a declining state. Its thirst for power cannot be ignored.​ https://t.co/IvcTCsEigK — Senator Ben Sasse (@SenSasse) June 30, 2016
Religious freedom attorneys and human rights groups are already preparing an appeal to Russia's Constitutional Court, reports Forum 18. The legislation drew widespread protests and religious leaders are uncertain how they can fulfill the law's obligations.
“Today is indeed a black day on the calendar,” lawyer Vladimir Ryakhovsky of the Slavic Centre for Law and Justice posted on his Facebook page. “Hope was that Vladimir Putin would not in the end sign this law. A law which openly contradicts the gospel command ‘go and make disciples' and, in addition, violates the constitutional rights of citizens.”
Mikhail Fedotov, chairman of the Presidential Council on Civil Society Development and Human Rights, protested the new amendments directly to Putin, asserting that they “create unjustified and excessive restrictions on the freedom of conscience of believers of all religions, and encroach upon the fundamental constitutional principle of non-interference by the state in the internal arrangements of religious associations.”
Financial penalties for violating the law are reportedly up to 50,000 roubles for individuals and up to one million roubles for organizations.
“We are distressed by the law and see it as repressive for believers in our country, because the law contradicts the Bible,” said a spokeswoman for the Council of Churches – Baptists. “We must assume there will be repression and persecution.”
“The United States government and all other nations that profess a commitment to religious freedom should urge Russia to repeal this unjust law, NRB President Dr. Jerry A. Johnson said. “Let's pray this new iron curtain of Christian persecution in Russia will be lifted quickly and without harm to our brothers and sisters in Christ.”
Depression is an illness. It is not a sin.
Some well-meaning Christians who have never experienced depression might tell us otherwise. They might tell us we'll feel better if we just have more faith. They might even tell us that God has the power to heal our depression, so antidepressants aren't necessary.
That is a dangerous and shallow view of mental illness.
Prayer Alone Won't Cure Depression
While I believe prayer can result in miracles, many times it doesn't. Clinical depression often, if not always, needs to be treated by a medical professional.
To be sure, prayer can help relieve our symptoms. Sometimes prayer alone makes us feel better in the same way that talking to our therapist makes us feel better.
But it's dangerous to tell a mentally ill person that prayer alone is the answer to depression. With the exception of fringe fundamentalists who believe all illness is the will of God and we should just suffer without treatment, most people would agree that it is neither wise nor reasonable to rely on prayer alone for other medical conditions; be it diabetes, heart disease or cancer. So why should depression or any other mental illness be any different?
Don't misunderstand me. I am a spiritual person. My worst bout with major depression happened this summer—and that was the closest I have ever been to God. I was literally on my knees several times a day asking for strength to get through the day. And it helped. A little.
My wife, the most important person in my support group, even tapes scripture to my bathroom mirror to remind me that I am not alone when I suffer. She is a source of spiritual nourishment in the times I don't feel like praying. She intervenes on my behalf. Faith for me doesn't mean I won't suffer, it just means I will never suffer alone.
One of the most troubling aspects of the stigma of mental illness is that some people don't get that it really is all in our heads, only not in the way they mean. It's in our brains. Depression is not a sign of weakness or spiritual shortcomings. It is a disease of the brain that often, or at least in my case, needs medical treatment.
There is no question that a healthy spiritual life can help in the battle against depression. It might even cure illnesses for some. I do not doubt that.
The rest of us should not feel ashamed if our prayers go unanswered, though.
Faith alone is not a good strategy for major depression.

As many readers already know, last week I launched a campaign to pressure Paul Krugman into debating me. In just the first week, this sophomoric 7-minute YouTube video has generated $35,000 in pledges. At this point, I don't see how Krugman will ever live this down until he debates me on Austrian versus Keynesian business-cycle theory.
In the present article, I'll give a little background of how I came up with the idea. Then I'll point out the broader implications of this episode, which go well beyond my jousting with Krugman.

The first ingredient for our story is a website called ThePoint. A couple of months ago my wife explained to me how "Groupon" works. (A business will offer an amazing coupon, but only if a critical number of people opt for the deal. It is a coupon that only works if adopted by a group, hence the name.) Not only is Groupon a brilliant idea — made possible through the Internet — but it shows how real-world markets are far more adaptive than they are modeled to be in mainstream economics.
I decided to write up a Mises Daily article on all this. But while doing research, I discovered that Groupon was itself the byproduct of a more general website, ThePoint. After watching its short video tutorial, I realized that ThePoint offers libertarians a very effective way to coordinate their efforts.
At the time, I tried brainstorming, but the best I could come up with was a campaign to buy a Super Bowl ad related to liberty. This type of project would be perfect for ThePoint — there would be lots of people willing to chip in $5 or $10, but they wouldn't want to waste their money if not enough people joined the cause. ThePoint's conditional framework — where your credit card is not billed until the specified objective is met — avoids this stumbling block. But since the Superbowl ad idea was not particularly earth-shattering, I moved on.
The next piece of the puzzle was the website Xtranormal, which offers a very convenient platform for quickly generating animated movies. I was vaguely aware of this site because I saw a short clip mocking Christine O'Donnell, but I assumed it took a huge investment of time. Then when Jeffrey Tucker created this cute video promoting the Mises Academy, he told me it was actually a piece of cake.
"Aha!" I thought. "If anybody can put off productive work in order to generate videos with amusing dialog, then surely it is me!" But as with ThePoint, here too I couldn't think of anything really great. So I went back to my usual routine of writing articles and blog posts.
Unbeknownst to me, these two seemingly independent ideas must have been germinating in my subconscious. For, a short while later, I watched The Social Network, the film describing the founding of Facebook. Watching young guys pursue their passion and become obscenely wealthy galvanized my inner entrepreneur. I wanted to come up with a big idea. But what?
Literally on the drive home from the theater, I conceived of my debate challenge to Paul Krugman. By soliciting pledges through ThePoint, donors would be reassured that they weren't throwing away their money. And by choosing soup kitchens across the country as the main beneficiaries (this was my original version, until I realized ThePoint could only designate one recipient of the check), what could Krugman possibly say? If we offered to pay him half the prize money, he could "be above it all." But soup kitchens?
ThePoint offers libertarians a very effective way to coordinate their efforts."
Even though I could see the potential of the campaign, I knew the mere launch wouldn't be enough. I had to explain the strategy behind it, to make sure everyone understood just what an awkward position Krugman would be in if the numbers rose above $100,000. I also knew a lot of people wouldn't understand why I wanted Ezra Klein as the moderator. (If you're curious, I settled on Klein because he had recently emailed Krugman, asking for an explanation of the various schools of thought and their prescriptions for a recession.)
At first, I thought I would have to write up an article explaining the overall strategy and answering objections. But no, that wasn't going to cut it. Nobody wants to read through a long commercial, especially a commercial with several different clauses. That's when I realized I could have two people hash it out in an Xtranormal video. It would be a much easier way to raise objections and answer them.
The rest, as they say, is history. I did some checking to make sure that ThePoint had actually handled big campaigns — unless they are complete frauds, they apparently sent a check for $10,000 to the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America after this guy started a campaign and sailed across the Atlantic. I also checked with the director of philanthropy at FoodBankNYC to make sure they had no objections to my plans.
Instant Success
To be honest, I didn't know if the campaign would catch on or not. It's so hard to tell which YouTube videos will "go viral" and which will fade into obscurity.
Needless to say, the success of the campaign exceeded my wildest expectations. Within the first 24 hours, it raised some $3,000, which totally shocked me. Within the first 37 hours, it had broken the $5,000 mark. Then because of this Tom Woods plug, the thing really took off, smashing through $10,000 a few hours later. The campaign broke outside standard Austrolibertarian circles, into the financial blogs, through Robert Wenzel, then Jeff Harding at Zerohedge (which also was reprinted at LRC), and most recently (as of this writing) John Carney at CNBC.
As I wrote on my blog to the readers who were excitedly watching the pledges roll in, "This isn't going to my head. I understand full well that the $5,000 raised in 37 hours is not a reflection of your love for me, but your hatred for Krugman."
Hundreds of fans of the Austrian School were joining the campaign, because they realized the wonderful corner into which Krugman would be painted. He would either have to debate someone well-versed in Austrian business-cycle theory or explain why a New York City food bank would miss out on $100,000+ in "right-wing" money. I wonder if Krugman is surprised at the intensity of the animosity? I was, so I'm betting he is too.
Broader Lessons
Besides the fun of the campaign — and the great teaching opportunity that should arise if and when Krugman breaks down and debates — there are broader lessons from this experience.
First, I want to stress the brilliant business plan of ThePoint and Xtranormal. I didn't have to pay anything to set up the campaign or to create my promotional video. These services were provided free, because their creators understand full well the importance of network effects.
Consider ThePoint. They don't really have too much overhead, except the server(s) to host the various campaigns. I didn't have to talk or even email with anyone in order to launch the campaign; the process was automated and took about 20 minutes.
As far as I can tell, ThePoint doesn't have advertisements yet. It has "Featured Campaigns," which may be a source of revenue. But as far as the Krugman debate is concerned, the only fees ThePoint will earn are the 5 percent of the pot once the money is collected. This sounds like a tidy sum, until you realize that credit cards (especially American Express) charge servicing fees that may very well average 3 percent to 4 percent, depending on the size of the individual donation. So I will be curious to see if ThePoint — like Facebook — tries to become the dominant website of its genre, and then implement "tasteful" ads.
Xtranormal's business model is even more clever. It is quite simple to get a video up and running; as their slogan says, "If you can type, you can make movies." They came up with a very user-friendly interface to control the characters' behavior. (For example, the male office worker in my video throws his hands up when he says, "It's in Alabama, for crying out loud!")
Now, one component of Xtranormal's strategy is obvious enough: they insert a commercial at the end of each freebie movie, pointing people to their site. But how do they actually make money? What pays for the computing power necessary to process the user instructions and generate animated movies?
As it turns out, Xtranormal sells "xtra-points" that can be used in the movie-making process. A moviemaker can use these points to access "sets" that are unavailable to the nonpaying customers, to choose from a wider variety of costumed characters, and to have greater flexibility in the movements of the characters.
Xtranormal's overall strategy is to attract large numbers of users by making the initial process free. Then, once people are hooked and everybody has already seen various videos using the freebie material, moviemakers will be inclined to actually start paying.
Intellectual Property and Funding Ideas
The most relevant lesson for Austrian economists is that we are seeing the transformation of funding mechanisms for those in the business of creating ideas. Before the rise of modern capitalism, artists and writers needed the support of wealthy patrons. But with capitalism and its "mass production for the needs of the masses," this dependence on the philanthropy of the rich receded.
The innovators of today are taking advantage of the new frontier of the Internet. Recognizing the obsolescence of "intellectual-property" laws, they are dreaming up new ways to earn a living from the production of ideas.
Yes, if the state suddenly stopped enforcing ownership claims on intangible, nonscarce things, we can imagine all sorts of potential problems. But surely these budding entrepreneurs — and thousands more rising from the ranks — are just the people to solve them.
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are relatively healthy, but they came out of Sunday's game against the New Orleans Saints with two injuries to starters. Center Evan Smith suffered an ankle injury and missed half the game, while Lovie Smith said today that Austin Seferian-Jenkins suffered a shoulder injury during the game.
That injury mostly went unnoticed in the heat of the game, but it seemed he suffered it late in the third quarter on a goal-line play where Jameis Winston overthrew him, and he got hit hard landing awkwardly on his shoulder. Quickly scanning through the rest of the game, I didn't see him get back on the field. He was listed as questionable to return at the time.
If Seferian-Jenkins can't go, that'll be a pretty big blow to the Bucs' passing game. While his performance as a run-blocker has been up-and-down at best, he's been Jameis Winston's primary receiving target this season, catching seven of ten targets for 139 yards and two touchdowns. Though he had a high-profile miscue yesterday when he failed to secure a deep ball while being tackled, he's been a constant threat as a receiver over the middle of the field. The Bucs have no one on the roster who could approximate his impact on the passing game -- not after they traded Tim Wright to the Detroit Lions.
The Bucs had a few other players leave the game with injuries, including D.J. Swearinger and Gerald McCoy, but they're fine and should be good to go for Sunday's game against the Houston Texans.
We should hear more about the severity of both Smith and Seferian-Jenkins' injuries on Wednesday, when the Bucs practice and will have to turn in an official injury report.
In a nod to the highly experimental nature of its Pittsburgh plan, Uber intends to have an actual human being behind the wheel — just in case. But while Ford is looking five years out, Uber is moving aggressively toward driverless fleets, despite the regulatory uncertainties.
“There's an urgency to our mission about being part of the future,” Travis Kalanick, Uber's chief executive, said on Thursday in an interview. “This is not a side project. This is existential for us.”
That explains Uber's other announcement on Thursday — its deal to buy Otto for undisclosed terms, to beef up its own in-house expertise in self-driving technology.
The acquisition of Otto follows Uber's recent opening of an advanced technology center in Pittsburgh, in conjunction with Carnegie Mellon University. The company has also hired engineers directly away from Google, which has been immersed in developing autonomous cars for a decade.
Like Uber, Google is intent on developing self-driving cars for urban taxi use — reasoning that the slow speeds and relatively predictable environment of city streets that can be thoroughly, digitally mapped is the best and safest near-term purpose of autonomous vehicles. But for Uber, such cars are not a side bet but a way to be more fully in control of its business by eliminating the need for drivers who expect to be paid.
“Uber arguably has more at stake in creating self-driving cars than any other automotive entity,” Mr. Brauer said.
Although the market for big sales of fully self-driving cars is still years away, the investment and research activities are on a fast track.
Bruno Senna believes the conditions in the Malaysian Grand Prix allowed him to prove he deserves his place in Formula One.
Having replaced Rubens Barrichello at Williams questions were asked whether the decision by Williams was based more on money than skill. However, after retiring from the season-opening Australian Grand Prix Senna bounced back with an impressive drive through the field at Sepang to score the team's first points of the season and he feels that the result proves that he is worth his place in the team on merit after displaying his talent in tricky conditions.
"I am really excited about the result today. I'm so happy that I have scored points for the team after a very tough race. It's on days like today that you can show what you can do in difficult conditions. I knew we had to attack after the restart, so it was very satisfying to push hard, not make any mistakes and to make my way up through the field."
Senna said that being able to climb back through the field after the red flag period was "really awesome".
"It was a good race. When you're on the move and slicing through the field in wet and dry conditions it's really awesome and we had a lot of close racing, sometimes being overtaken and sometimes overtaking and the guys did a great job in the team. They gave me a great car so I'm really happy that I managed to bring the car home. Even though at the restart we were dead last we still got home in the points so I'm happy for them and hopefully we can continue to be competitive."
While pleased with the result Senna added that he hoped the team could continue to move forward and better it later in the season.
"For sure the team has made a good step forward. We have a great bunch of guys in the team, we have a good engine, we have a good package and they develop the car. It's hopefully going to continue developing and getting quicker and maybe, hopefully, one day challenge the guys in front."

Now that the Santa Blanca Cartel has been dismantled, it is time to fight off Special Operations units from around the world as they try to take advantage of the situation and gain a foothold in Bolivia. Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands Ghost War will provide an immersive tactical player versus player experience. Communication, teamwork, and planning will be key in taking down your enemies.
Part of effective planning will be in choosing the best class for your team's needs. Ghost War will offer twelve different classes divided into three categories: Assault, Marksman, and Support. Each class will have its own perks and bonuses. Today we are thrilled to share with you three of the twelve classes that will be available to choose from at launch.
The Pointman falls under the Assault category and is a great choice for aggressive players who want to lead from the frontline. The Pointman's special ability is a passive immunity to the effects of suppression and of flashbang grenades. While others would have their vision disrupted by enemy fire or would be blinded by a flashbang, a Pointman cannot be disrupted in any way.
Combined with an excellent arsenal of high-power assault rifles, the Pointman's immunities make them a favorite to win any one-on-one fight. Be cautious exposing yourself though, as their resilience is not particularly high. Dart in and out of conflict zones or stay near proper cover to compensate for this.
The Scouts fall under the Support category and provide highly effective recon, while still bringing serviceable firepower. Their main function is to provide recon for their team. The Scout's drone is an effective tool in tracking down enemies and can be used to ensure constant map awareness for your team.
The special ability of the Scouts is a function of their drone, which will detect enemy's movement within their viewfinder and display their last known position. The drone can detect motion through anything, including obstacles. Enemies can counter this by standing still while the drone is flying overhead, but this will certainly disrupt their plans. In addition, while other drones may be shot down quickly in the heat of battle, the Scout drone is very light and maneuverable, making it easy for the Scouts to avoid bullets long enough to tag enemies.
Snipers fall under the Marksman category and use a high-powered sniper rifle, which can instantly take out any target. Snipers excel at long-range engagements and are most effective when positioned at a distant vantage point where they can land methodical kills.
Snipers have access to bolt-action rifles that have the biggest damage output of all the Marksman classes. Not even walls can stop the Snipers: their unique ability is that they use high-penetration rounds that do not lose damage when going through an obstacle. Having this guardian angel looking over you will give you the tactical edge you need to conquer any enemy.
Pointman, Scout, and Sniper are only three of the twelve classes that will be available at launch. We are also planning on adding some more classes later down the road. You'll be able to try out six of our classes during the Open Beta coming soon. Let us know which class you feel best fits your playstyle.
The Open Beta for Ghost War will take place September 21–25 on all platforms (Playstation 4 system, Xbox One, and PC). For more on this event, go to the official Open Beta portal and be sure to visit our official forums to share your feedback, or join the Ghost War Open Beta discord channel to find other players to play with.
Also, make sure to share your Open Beta glorious moments with us by sharing them on Twitter using #GhostRecon or posting on the official forum's dedicated thread. The best streams or community creations will be highlighted on our official channels!
The other night, I was at a small party where I brought up the idea of bicycle registration. Should bicycle owners, I asked the man next to me, be required to register their bicycles with the police?
His answer was a firm and unequivocal yes. In his opinion, bicycles should be registered so that their owners could be held accountable for their actions and any injuries they might cause.
Then I told my friend about the situation in Fort Lauderdale, where a no-fee bike registration law was implemented in 2003, requiring every bike owned by a city resident to be registered with the cops. There, the program has been touted not as a means of holding cyclists accountable for crashes or law-breaking, but as a theft-prevention measure: according to the Florida city's website, “a bicycle registration program is vital to the safety and well being of every resident in our community.”
In practice, I told the pro-registration guy, it seems the requirement is enforced in a heavily lopsided manner against the city's African American residents. According to the Miami New Times, the Broward County public defender has accused the Fort Lauderdale police department of unconstitutional racial profiling in enforcement of the ordinance, and the paper's investigation in late 2013 revealed that 86 percent of the 460 citations issued over the previous three years were issued to black people. (Just 31 percent of the city's population is African American.) Cops, the article alleges, use the registration ordinance as a convenient excuse to stop people suspected of other crimes. When issuing citations for unregistered bikes, they impound the vehicles, leaving people without transportation, sometimes miles from home.
This type of selective enforcement of bike laws is hardly confined to Florida.
When New Times followed up on the story this month, they found the number of tickets had gone way down, but the percentage that went to African Americans had actually gone up, to 93 percent. “We've still got a law that's only being used in black neighborhoods,” Broward Public Defender Howard Finkelstein told the paper. East of Federal Highway, in the affluent and mostly white part of town, officers wrote only one citation for an unregistered bike. The police department declined to comment to New Times about the numbers.
I pointed out to my friend at the party that this type of selective enforcement of bike laws is hardly confined to Florida. In New York, where we live, biking on the sidewalk is against the law in every part of the city, but the ordinance prohibiting it is applied wildly unevenly. A recent study from a City University of New York professor found that 12 of the 15 neighborhoods with the most sidewalk-riding summonses were predominantly Latino or black, while 14 of the 15 with the fewest summonses were majority white. And as someone who lives in a majority-white neighborhood where lots of people ride bikes, I can tell you for sure that if the NYPD wanted to write a good chunk of tickets to white people riding bikes, they could do it in an afternoon around the corner from me.
Never call your mother. Don't text back the person you're sleeping with; make sure you wait at least five hours before returning the texts of the numerous people you're sleeping with. Don't spend Christmas with your girlfriend or your family. Spend Christmas at a resort with your bro friends and tweet about it. Check in on Foursquare.
Take pictures of the food you're eating in other countries and post them on Facebook. Take your time ‘figuring out your plan' while your aging parents extend themselves to pay back your student debt. Brag about your dick size. Brag about your game. Brag about how many beautiful women you have been with this week to the woman you are drunkenly going home with.
Pursue a woman and then lose interest when you finally earn her reciprocation. Go home with a woman, pet her cats when you get in her door at night, and wait until she's sitting in your lap taking her shirt off to say ‘I'm not really looking for a girlfriend.' Spend a long time explaining why your disbelief in monogamy is morally superior. Or just don't talk about it. Master the phase-out.
Complain a lot about shit getting weird, or people getting weird. Describe in depth how it's always other people's fault that you are ‘in a situation.' Say you're just too nice to everyone and that's why you're not happy. Say your friends are always taking advantage of you and that's why you don't find the time to go to their shows or their readings or to read their articles. Be way too excited about media from the 1980s. Militantly defend your right to have a serious interest in children's cartoons.
You could take a lot of pictures of yourself and put them on Facebook, but if you want to do this right, have other people take a lot of pictures of you. Have a girl take a lot of pictures of you. Be Facebook friends with a lot of very pretty girls who have shy, pained looks, are shown cradling little cameras like they are really looking for something nice to take pictures of. Appear in the pictures they took but never be photographed beside them. Be Facebook friends with a lot of very pretty girls who are too cool to put anything in their profiles.
Say you ‘love geeks' and then make fun of them. Make fun of your friends for all of their interests. Do this aggressively until it's hurtful. Then laugh a lot and make them feel like they're weak or too sensitive. They don't understand your humor.
Send mass texts that say ‘what are you doing tonight', and choose from the best option. Ask someone who invites you out ‘who else is there.' Suddenly be on the other side of town if you change your mind about the option. Don't answer the people who bother to reply with less compelling options. When everyone leaves the bar to go to your friend's birthday, stay at the bar because you're ‘trying to get something going on.' No one will be surprised.
Go to parties and don't bring any money and suddenly become interested in making friends with the one person at the party who has something you want to consume. Have really great bonding time with that person only on occasions when you and that person is consuming things. Say you will totally get lunch with them sometime and have a real conversation not-fucked-up and never do it. Puke in the sink.
Go to parties and decide to have ‘the talk' there with someone you've been in a fight with or who broke your heart or whose heart you broke. Be those people who are having a really dramatic intense discussion in a corner or on the roof all night and make all the other guests uncomfortable. Do not let the other person escape. Make sure the other person has plenty to drink. Leave the party once they are locked in the bathroom throwing up and worrying others, and ask the person's friend to take care of them before you leave so that you can feel like you're a good person.
Steal coats. Steal laptops. Steal people's shit from parties. Blame ‘the black guys' who showed up later. Lie about your drinking problem. Lie about your drug problem. Exaggerate about your childhood. Be a victim. Make excuses. Refuse to believe you're not a really good person. Talk a lot about how you are not well understood. Talk a lot about how you are a survivor and ‘reach out' to others so you can help them be more like you. Hit reply-all on emails.
Have, like, a really hard time finding a job right now. Complain about the economy. Don't watch the news, then complain about politics in vague terms. Be aggrieved. Get other people to make you dinner. Get other people to lend you money. Always have an expensive record collection, no matter how hungry you are.
Refuse to look at girls who aren't skinny. Have an idealized idea of your future partner that no realistic human being can match. Judge everyone for not living up to your expectations. Blame your upbringing, blame your family, blame your poor Mom. Only call her when you are drinking with your friends and when she texts you, make fun of how she doesn't have the hang of it yet. Make websites about how your parents don't know how to do modern things. Circulate them at your workplace.
Make tumblrs about yourself. Circulate them on Twitter. Insist on being heard. Leave comments on articles complaining that the article was too long for you to have read.

There's a lot to learn from the world's most prolific minds.
We hear a lot about how eccentric some of the most famous writers and artists were in their productivity routines. Take for example Beethoven, who counted each and every one of the 60 coffee beans for his morning coffee. Or Honoré de Balzac, who drank as many as 50 cups of black coffee every day. How about Igor Stravinsky, who stood on his head whenever he felt uninspired?
But others, if not most, of their productivity secrets were pretty down to earth and common sense.
We sometimes forget that even those we regard as most talented and most productive, those that we almost idolize for their creativity, are human beings just like you and me. What makes them stand out, and what we often refuse to see because it's less glamorous to acknowledge, is that they work hard and have an unwavering work ethic.
So let's take a look at some of the world's greatest minds, and what productivity secrets helped them produce their best work.
Break down your tasks
Do you think your mornings are busy? Think again!
Anthony Trollope, one of the most productive Victorian era novelists, wrote 3000 words every morning. That is, every morning, at 5:30 am, before going on to his day job at the post office. He kept this routine for over 33 years, and went on to write no less than 47 novels.
He undertook writing as a second job, and although he knew he didn't have to write for the publishers, Trollope made it his mission to stick to his self-imposed rules.
But Trollope didn't just dive into the 3000 daily words that he needed to write. No, instead, he divided his work into chunks of 250 words (what he defined as a page) for every 15 minutes. After three hours, he'd have 3000 words. Trollope was also quite meticulous in counting every word as he was writing.
He kept a daily record of the number of pages he wrote, never allowing himself to slip away.
“When I have commenced a new book, I have always prepared a diary, divided into weeks, and carried it on for the period which I have allowed myself for the completion of the work. In this I have entered, day by day, the number of pages I have written, so that if at any time I have slipped into idleness for a day or two, the record of that idleness has been there, staring me in the face, and demanding of me increased labour, so that the deficiency might be supplied.” ~ Anthony Trollope - An Autobiography
Delve in menial tasks
There's something about mindless work that seems to unblock creative juices. Have you ever noticed how you might get your best ideas when you're doing the dishes or vacuuming?
Choreographer George Balanchine apparently did most of his work in the morning, as he was doing the ironing for the day.
“When I'm ironing, that's when I do most of my work.” ~ George Balanchine
Perhaps more famously, Woody Allen swears by the what a hot shower can do to the stuck creative mind.
“In the shower, with the hot water coming down, you've left the real world behind, and very frequently things open up for you.” ~ Woody Allen
Be comfortable in your working environment
Pianist and composer George Gershwin worked - according to his brother, Ira - at his piano for twelve hours a day, in his pyjamas, bathrobe and slippers. He started in late morning and went on until midnight.
No doubt that if Gershwin had been comfortable composing in a tuxedo, he would have worked in a tuxedo. But instead, he chose to work in his PJs and slippers - because that's how he felt most comfortable.
So much for that office dress code, hm?!
Take time to reflect
Both Joan Didion and Maya Angelou take time to reflect on the day's work.
In a 1968 Paris Review interview, Joan Didion said:
“I need an hour alone before dinner, with a drink, to go over what I've done that day. I can't do it late in the afternoon because I'm too close to it. Also, the drink helps. It removes me from the pages. So I spend this hour taking things out and putting other things in.”
On the other hand, Maya Angelou reviews her morning work after dinner.
But no matter when you choose to review your day's work, there's a lot of value in doing so. For both Didion and Angelou, it gives them a hint on where to start working on the next day.
Stick to a rigorous routine
Writer Haruki Murakami sticks to a very rigorous routine. He is a notorious runner, which he picked up to stay fit after he had decided to become a writer.
This is what he had to say in a Paris Review interview about his routine while working on a novel:
“When I'm in writing mode for a novel, I get up at 4:00 am and work for five to six hours. In the afternoon, I run for 10km or swim for 1500m (or do both), then I read a bit and listen to some music. I go to bed at 9:00 pm. I keep to this routine every day without variation. The repetition itself becomes the important thing; it's a form of mesmerism. I mesmerize myself to reach a deeper state of mind.”
Murakami also parallels building endurance as a runner with building endurance as a novelist - and perhaps not coincidentally, he picked up both writing and running at the same time. His routine resulted in over 30 years of efficient work.
Admit when something doesn't work
Some of the most talented writers are in fact great self-editors. Take for example Maya Angelou:
“And more often than not if I've done nine pages I may be able to save two and a half or three. That's the cruelest time you know, to really admit that it doesn't work. And to blue pencil it. When I finish maybe fifty pages and read them — fifty acceptable pages — it's not too bad.”
Same with Ernest Hemingway. In a 1934 letter to F. Scott Fitzgerald, he wrote:
“I write one page of masterpiece to ninety-one pages of shit. I try to put the shit in the wastebasket.”
So it's not that these writers are so talented that they never write crap. They do write crap. But they also have the courage to discard the work that is not up to par.
Nobody's work is 100% awesome all the time. Know when yours isn't either, and don't be afraid to self-edit.
Be accountable to others
In his autobiography, Isaac Asimov tells about how, as a boy, he used to get up at 6 am every morning to deliver papers, and then rushed home from school to help out in his dad's candy store every afternoon. If he was late, his father yelled at him, telling him that he was a folyack, an Yiddish word for slacker.
This built a life-long habit for Asimov. More than 50 years later, he wrote:
"It is a point of pride with me that though I have an alarm clock, I never set it, but get up at 6 A.M. anyway. I am still showing my father I'm not a folyack.”
Of course, you're not doing your work for the sake of your parents, or anyone else for that matter. But by being accountable to others, like Asimov was to his father, you are more likely to stick with your work even when you don't feel like it.
Work little by little
Rome wasn't built in a day.
Even when it might seem that you're not being productive, being consistent and doing a little bit of work every day will help you get far.
For example, Alice Munro learned to write during her three children's nap times, in between feedings, and while dinner was being cooked. Yes, it did take almost 20 years to put together her first short story collection, but last year Munro received the Nobel prize for literature.
Gertrude Stein also wrote little by little. In fact, she admitted that she had never been able to write for more than half an hour a day, but she said:
"If you write a half-hour a day, it makes a lot of writing years by year."
Get some privacy
Apparently, Igor Stravinsky was unable to compose unless he was sure that nobody heard him. At one point, he even went as far as to work on a piano kept in a combination lumber storage-chicken coop, where he composed some of his most famous works.
There's something to be said about getting some privacy. If your work is edited (read: judged) at an early stage, it will certainly reduce your enthusiasm.
It's also the reason why open-concept offices don't really work. The loss of privacy usually also results in a loss of productivity for the team members - and even, as it turns out, decreased communication.
Stick with it even when you don't feel like it
Even Tchaikovsky had bad, unproductive days. His secret? Stick with it!
In a letter to his benefactress Nadezhda von Meck, Tchaikovsky wrote:
“A few days ago I told you I was working every day without any real inspiration. Had I given way to my disinclination, undoubtedly I should have drifted into a long period of idleness. But my patience and faith did not fail me, and to-day I felt that inexplicable glow of inspiration of which I told you; thanks to which I know beforehand that whatever I write to-day will have power to make an impression, and to touch the hearts of those who hear it.” ~ The Life & Letters of Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky
So even when he wasn't feeling inspired, Tchaikovsky knew the purpose of his work, and that if he stuck with it long enough, he would get his motivation back.

Lawmakers Consider Medical Marijuana Bill to Protect California from Federal Raids
SACRAMENTO, CA — The California legislature is about to vote on urgently needed legislation that would clarify the legality of medical marijuana sales, production, transportation, processing and testing through a state-regulated licensing system.
The legislation – AB 604 by Assemblyman Tom Ammiano – would eliminate current ambiguities in the law and regulate the commercial production and distribution of medical marijuana under the state Alcohol Beverages Commission.
AB 604 would advance medical marijuana users' interests by finally addressing the mandate of Prop 215 for a “safe and affordable” distribution system. Most critically, this legislation would help protect California from further federal raids by meeting the Department of Justice's newly announced conditions for “strong and effective” state regulation. AB 604 would regulate marijuana in a manner similar to that already successfully done in Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, and other states that have been spared federal raids.

AB 604 would not impose any new taxes, nor would it change the existing rights of Prop 215 patients and their caregivers to grow marijuana for their own medical use at home. Collectives and other businesses engaged in the commercial production and sale of marijuana would be required to register with the ABC. Regulations would require appropriate environmental and security safeguards, product labeling and testing, and compliance with local land use laws.
NORML and other reform groups strongly support AB 604 as an essential step to protect legal access to medical marijuana. However, both bills face strident opposition from the California Narcotics Officers Association, which wants to keep marijuana illegal and keep busting dispensaries and growers.
A companion bill in the Senate by Darrell Steinberg and Mark Leno is also in process.
PLEASE CONTACT YOUR LEGISLATORS NOW AND URGE THEM TO SUPPORT AB 604. Time is critical – the legislature only has until next Friday, Sept 13th to act.

0 Lake Mary collection agency raided as IRS, Secret Service investigate $70M scheme
LAKE MARY, Fla. - Agents with the Internal Revenue Service and the Secret Service didn't say much Monday as they served a warrant at a collection agency in Lake Mary.
Owner Leonard Potillo III appeared in a federal courtroom and was charged in a $76 million scheme, Channel 9's Tim Barber learned.
Agents said Potillo was tied to a money laundering ring involving World Recovery Service, which was raided on Monday in Lake Mary.
Potillo is accused of scamming third-party debt purchases out of more than $70 million by making the value of the debt appear more valuable than it actually was.
He was indicted on seven counts of wire fraud, 10 counts of bribing bank officials and 16 counts of unlawful monetary transactions.
Barber was told agents went into World Recovery Service and ordered everyone to get off of their phones and outside.
Channel 9 was there Monday as dozens of frustrated employees were forced out of the building.
"I'm actually here to get paid from the last eight weeks of working here," one woman told Channel 9. "Tried to walk upstairs. Can't even walk upstairs because they've been seized."
Agents were reportedly going through documents and interviewing people, but none of the agencies would elaborate on the purpose of the warrant.
The judge ordered Potillo into the custody of the U.S. marshals for three days while he figures out if he has enough money to pay for a private attorney.
I really shouldn't be writing a column this week. I've come down with a one-two punch of stomach flu and food poisoning and have spent the past 48 hours trying to keep my insides on the inside while the room spins suspiciously around me.
I'm obviously in no state to work. But the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) would disagree. Between December 2011 and February 2014, 2,380 people died of a chronic or terminal illness shortly after being found “fit for work”. I doubt that it would make an exception for me and my norovirus. This is Tory Britain. You work until you collapse and then you work some more and you'd better be grateful. I'm just trying to move with the times.
The DWP fought to stop that figure being released and for good reason: it puts another number on the inhumanity of the new sickness tests, which had already been linked to between 40 and 80 suicides. I should say “fitness tests”, because nobody gets to be sick any longer under Iain Duncan Smith (so good at rebranding ideological cuts that they named him twice, once for each face). Navigating this system is humiliating enough for disabled people without them being lied to every step of the way. If the DWP would just come out and say that it doesn't believe the state should help people who are ill, disabled or injured, it would somehow be more bearable. At least people would know where it stood. But the stated aim of the welfare changes is to “get people working”, because: “Work is the best route out of poverty.”
This is a fib on several levels. Not only is in-work poverty a larger drain on the benefits system than the unemployed, but most of the things that help disabled people get back to work have been cut. The Tories have slashed carer budgets and closed the Remploy factories that helped disabled people into the work so many of them desperately want to engage with but can't. They got away with this by launching an all-out propaganda assault that portrays disabled and workless people as “scroungers”, “sponging” off the state, when presumably they should be grateful not to be left on a hillside to die as would have been done in the good old days.
The new figures prove beyond doubt that the “Employment and Support Allowance” system and personal independence tests are throwing people off benefits and forcing them to seek work that is either inconsistent or non-existent when they are not just incapacitated, but dying. It's no wonder that the UN has launched an investigation into Britain's disability benefits system for potentially violating the human rights of those who are forced to navigate the twisted system of forms, delays and outright lies.
Then again, numbers can only tell you so much, so let's put this in context. I recently spoke to a woman with a rare disease, which keeps her bed-bound for days, even weeks at a time. The DWP told her that she was fit for work. When charity workers involved with her case came to check on her, they found bottles of urine stacked around the bed and piles of half-eaten ready-meals, which the woman had been consuming cold. She had been unable to reach the kitchen or the toilet. Caseworkers told her that her illness wasn't that bad: because she was bed-bound for only three to 14 days at a time, she probably wouldn't starve and she could technically survive lying in her excreta for that long. So why should the state give her any help? This is Tory Britain. You've got to lie in your own shit and piss for longer than two weeks before you're considered sick.
“I feel like I've been robbed twice,” another young woman told me. She had spent a year and a half appealing to the DWP over benefit cuts and was then found ready for employment, despite collapsing with pain and being carried out of the interview room. “I've been robbed first by my health and then by the government, by not giving me the insurance I paid for. I'm now on suicide watch. I wasn't suicidal before I applied. I am now.”
The benefit tests do not merely stop disabled people getting the help they need. They actively make people sicker. They plunge the already depressed into suicidal despair; they wear down the chronically and terminally ill with stress and bureaucratic exhaustion. Nobody's first thought on being diagnosed with a serious illness is: “Hooray, now I can scam the taxpayer for £73 a week.” But claiming benefits has become so onerous and terrifying that many sick people are now too frightened to apply or appeal. They choose instead to drop out of the process after months or years and accept permanent poverty – and that is precisely the point.
The welfare state is being dismantled and rebuilt as a machine to manage and discipline the workforce into accepting precarious labour, low pay and no social safety net. Iain Duncan Smith is proud of this machine. The machine is not broken, as many critics have suggested. It is doing what it was remade and designed to do. It is efficiently driving all the hope out of a sickening and insecure labour class.
The Conservatives speak of delivering a smaller state but they are more than happy to use the mechanisms of state to grind all the fight out of the poor. This is the state weaponised against the vulnerable, to make them believe that they are less than human. This is the welfare state twisted into a tool to separate human beings from their social conscience. Simply getting rid of the welfare state would have been easier and cheaper, but this way the Tories can persuade the most vulnerable in society to accept their fate and the rest of us to believe that they deserve it. That is why the benefits system is a moral hazard to us all, whether or not we are sick. The UN is right to investigate and the government and the public should listen before it's too late.

Shopping Malls May Be Staples Of Society, But These Abandoned Ones Are Terrifying
There are few things more American than the ubiquitous shopping mall. A mall is more than just a collection of shops; it's often a community gathering center. When a shopping mall closes its doors for the last time, things start to take on a more grim aspect.
Take a look at some of these surreal photographs from abandoned shopping malls across the country. Be sure to check out the Dead Malls Enthusiasts Facebook group for more info on where these places are located.
I can easily understand how someone could get extremely lost in one of these massive abandoned shopping malls. Can you imagine your local mall going out of business like this? Would you ever want to explore one of these malls?
Stacy Snyder, a federal court has ruled, won't be teaching kids the three Arrrrs any time soon: They've rejected Snyder's claim that her First Amendment rights were violated when a MySpace photo showing her engaged in a bit of boozy buccaneering, as well as posts complaining about her relationship with a supervisor, cost the former Millersville University student a teaching degree.
In 2006, Snyder had been a student teacher at Conestoga Valley High School in Pennsylvania, as required by both Millersville's teaching curriculum and the state's teacher certification guidelines. Her performance reviews often complained of Snyder's lack of professionalism—and her shaky grasp of the subject matter she had been assigned to teach.
But the final straw for the school came when they saw that Snyder's MySpace account—which she had mentioned to students on several occasions—contained a photo of the grog-swilling Snyder in a pirate hat, captioned "drunken pirate," as well as posts alluding to her fraught relationship with her supervisor. They called Snyder at home and told her to walk the plank out of their student teaching program. Since she'd failed to complete her student teaching practicum, Millersville denied Snyder a teaching degree, instead shuffling some credits around to award her a BA in English.
Snyder took the school to court, and while judge Paul Diamond of the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania promptly dismissed her due process claims, as well as several statutory claims, he allowed her to press the argument that the denial had violated her First Amendment right to free expression.
On Wednesday, however, the judge tossed that claim as well. Snyder, Diamond found, "was an apprentice more akin to a public employee/teacher than a student" during her time at CV High. As such, the First Amendment protects her speech about matters of "public concern"—she couldn't be barred from the student-teaching program for expressing an unpopular political opinion—but not personal MySpace postings the school found to be unprofessional. Moreover, once the school had declined to certify her completion of the program, Millersville administrators had no authority to override the degree requirements to award Snyder a teaching diploma.
A warning to prospective public employees, then: it may be that on the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog. But they are apt to find out if you're a drunken pirate.
The NFL draft is a time of transition. College players become professionals. One of the biggest draws of the draft is the suspense of not knowing who your team will pick. Everyone knew the Texans were high on an offensive weapon, but which one would they pick?
The Texans ended up with Notre Dame wide receiver Will Fuller. Fuller, 22, collected 1,258 yards and 14 touchdown catches on 62 receptions during his junior season with the Fighting Irish.
After all the press conferences with draft day hats and jerseys are finished, the question becomes how he will work out. Until then, we can suffice with some photoshop magic to show what Fuller will look like as a Texan. Here we go:
Fuller will wear #15. The last Texans player to wear that number was Ryan Mallett. Here's to Fuller surpassing the success of the Texans' last No. 15.
Recently, one of my good friends broke up with her boyfriend.
Details: unnecessary.
Suffice it to say that over many texts and phone calls and Gchats with me and others, she determined it was time to end a relationship that was no longer working. There was no big blow up, just a slow ending.
Now she finds herself holding the tattered remains of feelings – those feelings that will always need to be patched and pieced together when a relationship ends. But these feelings are not just feelings. They are lined with the slippery fabric of guilt for having feelings at all. Or rather, guilt over having certain feelings and different guilt over not having certain others.
Penny, I just feel so out of it lately and not sure what it's right and wrong to feel.
There is a fallacy of logic in that statement – an implication that feelings can be moral or immoral, right or wrong. Feelings are feelings. They just are. Desire, jealousy, anger, remorse, happiness, schadenfreude… they're involuntary internal reactions based on personality, past experience, and environment.
Guilt over these thoughts and feelings is perhaps the stickiest of all the residuals that linger from the pre-Enlightenment rooting of Western morality in religion, specifically in Christianity. Whether in our love lives or our professional lives – or just in our daily commuting lives – there is an awful lot of angst over how we should or should not be feeling in any given moment.
But being a moral person is not about what or how you feel. Rather, being a moral person is about how you act on those feelings.
Morals and their accompanying virtues are ideals held up by society to make living in community possible and, hopefully, peaceable. To make a gross oversimplification of an amalgamation of various philosophical Ideas: Over the centuries these strictures have evolved and eventually morphed into one great societal Super Ego that somehow manages to burden us all with a swarm of Jiminy Crickets chirping about some nebulous idea of “should” formed from a mishmash of religious and secular ideologies.
These “shoulds” have, somehow, moved on from governing our actions to policing our thoughts.
Should my friend feel sad? If she feels sad, then sure.
Should my friend feel angry? If she feels angry, then sure.
Should my friend miss her ex? If she misses him, then sure.
Should my friend feel relieved to be done with the anxiety of a failing relationship? If she feels relieved, then sure.
Feel what you feel!
Human emotion is a colorful spectrum, from the blackest melancholy to the pastel-est gaiety. We should be careful not to attach morality to these emotions, lest we find ourselves one day circumscribed to a few very dull beiges with perhaps a nice taupe or eggshell thrown in if we've been especially good.
Thirty-two years ago, the two of us and 1,043 other protesters were arrested for what one would now call “occupying” Wall Street. It was October 29, 1979, the 50th anniversary of the Wall Street crash that ushered in the Great Depression. We two were then graduate students at Princeton, and we had trained for weeks as part of an “affinity group” of about a dozen people prepared to commit acts of civil disobedience to prevent what we saw as a greater evil. It was about six months after the catastrophe at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania. And so, on the 29th, thousands of us blocked off the entrances to Wall Street to protest the corporate funding of the nuclear power industry.
But the protests were not only about the nuclear industry. The day before, we had joined a giant rally against corporate power at the World Trade Center. Then, in the early dawn of the 29th, our affinity group and hundreds of other such groups from across the country gathered to surround Wall Street and shut it down. Our group went to its assigned street corner where we sat down and linked arms. Police were everywhere, many of them seated menacingly atop horses; they were equally determined to keep Wall Street open that day.
The smell of those horses comes back vividly to us both now in October 2011, as we join the protesters of Occupy DC. We remember our aches from the horses' painful butting as we revel in the vibrancy of the new Occupy Wall Street movement spreading to cities across this country and around the world.
Journalists have been asking us where this new movement comes from. We tell them our Wall Street story of 32 years ago, which none seem to know. And we do our best to impress upon them the reality that this new “occupy” movement has very deep roots.
Occupy DC. Photo by Robin Broad.
These roots were planted over the past century by the millions of workers who stood up to exploitation and won basic labor rights and convinced governments to raise taxes on the very wealthy to create a middle class.
That fight sprouted a new root—the struggle for civil rights—a battle that melded with other efforts to end an unjust war in Vietnam.
Then, in the 1970s, women came together to change how the Unites States thought about sexism. They created the space for new movements to later ask, if you think sexism is wrong, why is homophobia okay?
Then environmentalists across the globe started asking why it was okay to bequeath our grandchildren a polluted planet. In Kenya, a young woman named Wangari Maathai (a woman whose recent death we mourn) began planting trees with other women as they claimed control over their lives. These are deep roots indeed.
We sent a potent message that people organized across issues could stand up to corporate power and change the course of history.
Two decades ago, these movements gave birth to the global justice movement, and millions united to oppose corporate greed and corporate rule. In Chiapas, Mexico, in the mid-1990s, indigenous people stood up to free trade rules configured to make them anything but free. And they said—enough.
Twelve years ago, 65,000 people converged on Seattle to say no to global trade rules structured to give expanded power to corporations while undermining regulations created to protect people and the environment. On the streets of Seattle, unions and environmentalists linked arms, as did global justice activists from South and North. During that fateful week, we shut down the meetings of the World Trade Organization and sent a potent message that people organized across issues could stand up to corporate power and change the course of history.
Nine years ago, 15 million people in 600 cities said no to war against Iraq. Three years ago, millions poured into the streets to fight for immigrant rights.
This is the Peoples' History that informs today's protests.
Occupy Everywhere
How what started as an idea
became a global reality.
And if the great peoples' historian Howard Zinn were alive today, he would be busy writing a new chapter at this very moment. That new chapter might well start in the spring with the fruit vendor in Tunisia who said: enough. It would describe the millions of Egyptians who said: enough.
It would include the brave people of Wisconsin—who ate pizzas and other food donated not just by supporters across the U.S. but also by some of those very Egyptians—as they took over the state capitol building in February to say “enough” to the Wisconsin governor who tried to roll back sixty years of hard-won protections for workers and ordinary people.
Yes, a part of our history is one of war, racism, genocide, and violent inequality. But an equally important part—the part that is too-often not retold—is the history of people coming together, fighting back, and creating a more decent and humane union.

The United States had a Gold Cup to forget, as it was dumped out by Jamaica in the semifinals. Jeff Carlisle, Doug McIntyre and Jason Davis take a look at where Jurgen Klinsmann and the U.S. go from here.
Should Klinsmann's future be in doubt?
Davis (@DavisJsn): Absolutely. Even without considering the cost to the federation and Klinsmann's mandate to push the United States national team forward tactically and stylistically, he has overseen the worst performance in the Gold Cup since 2000. Without an obvious replacement it's probably not the time to make a change, but if Klinsmann fails to win the Confederations Cup playoff versus Mexico in October, I think his future should be in doubt. Judging him within the context of the revolution he was meant to oversee, there's not much argument that he shouldn't at least be under significant scrutiny from his bosses as U.S. Soccer.
McIntyre (@DougMacESPN): Based on his overall record since being hired four years ago (41-14-18, with a 56 percent win rate), even including what was without doubt a dreadful Gold Cup for the U.S. team, the answer is no. It's easy to overreact in the wake of such disappointing performances (it wasn't so much the fourth-place finish as the dismal overall play of the U.S. against everyone except Cuba), but nobody was calling for Klinsmann's head last month after the U.S. beat the Netherlands and Germany on the road.
Carlisle (@JeffreyCarlisle): No, at least not in the short term. Without question, the U.S. underperformed in the Gold Cup and Klinsmann has invited more scrutiny on himself and the team as a result. But this was one tournament, and Klinsmann should be given the opportunity to pull this team out of the funk that it's clearly in. If this drags into World Cup qualifying, then his future should be reexamined.
What if the U.S. loses the Confederations Cup playoff against Mexico on Oct. 9?
Carlisle: No. One of the hallmarks of the U.S. program over the years has been its stability. It doesn't fire coaches after a couple of bad results. Bob Bradley was the one exception to this in the second cycle, but overall, patience is a good trait to have.
Look at what happened to Mexico in the last cycle, firing coaches after mere weeks or months. It should have cost them qualification and only a huge slice of luck saw them survive. Obviously this individual case is different, but the U.S. approach is beneficial. Both Bruce Arena and Bradley (first cycle) went through difficult spells and they were allowed to work their way through things. Klinsmann should be given the same chance.
Davis: If the U.S. loses to Mexico with a Confederation Cup spot on the line only months after finishing fourth in the Gold Cup, Klinsmann will need to go. The confidence hit that the team has taken is already something that needs months to fix, and if Klinsmann proves unable to produce said fix in time for the playoff, there's no reason to think he's the man to take the team into World Cup qualifying next year.
McIntyre: I think it would be harsh to dismiss any coach for losing a one-off match to Mexico in front of a heavy El Tri crowd at the Rose Bowl. But really it's moot: U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati said it's not going to happen. I don't think Klinsmann is in any danger of losing his job unless the U.S. is on the brink of not qualifying for Russia 2018. Even then, depending on the specific circumstances of course, I'd bet on Gulati giving Klinsmann a chance to get out of it.
Who is this team? The one that beat world champions Germany in June or the one that lost to Jamaica in the Gold Cup?
Davis: Right now, it's much closer to the team that lost to Jamaica, but that is entirely Klinsmann's doing. Friendly wins over big European nations look good on paper, but they can't be said to be a legitimate measure of Klinsmann's ability to prepare his team when the games truly matter. With a trophy on the line, Klinsmann's teams looked unready, lethargic and unclear of the plan. Ad hoc works against Germany with nothing on the line -- it doesn't work in a do-or-die match against an organized and resolute Jamaica.
Carlisle: The U.S. is what it's always been, a team that is capable of beating anyone and also losing to anyone, so it's a side that tends to play up or down to the level of opposition.
It's also a team in transition. In fact, it reminds many people of four years ago when Bradley tried to revamp the defense and the results tended to suffer. The difference was that Bradley, and Klinsmann for the most part during the last cycle, still put out lineups with at least some experience in defense. That balance was lacking during the Gold Cup.
McIntyre: It's hard to say. This moment is a particularly interesting one for the national team: older players like DaMarcus Beasley and Kyle Beckerman were kept around to help the Americans win the Gold Cup. Do they also come back in October for the playoff? What about when World Cup qualifying begins a few weeks later? Right now there are more questions than answers.
What was the biggest disappointment from the Gold Cup?
McIntyre: The U.S. generated the fewest shots of any team in the group stage, including hapless Canada, which didn't score a single goal. In the third place game, Panama out-shot Klinsmann's squad 25-5. Those are just astounding statistics, and they speak to how poorly the team played this month.
Carlisle: Statistically, the fact that outside of the Cuba victory the U.S. was outshot 85-47 is just shocking. But a bigger concern was how performances seemed to have no bearing on playing time.
It's one thing to give players an extended spell in the lineup, but if they're clearly struggling -- as many of the defenders were -- then I think they have to be held accountable at some point. Klinsmann rarely, if ever, did that.
Davis: The lack of control the U.S. showed, particularly in the group stage. There's an argument that the semifinal against Jamaica came down to two set pieces and some bad luck for the Americans but no such argument can be made to explain away lackluster performances in the team's opening three matches against significantly weaker opposition. The loss to the Reggae Boyz came only as a mild shock specifically because the U.S. had done very little well over the course of the tournament.
What is the biggest single challenge facing Klinsmann and the U.S. in the immediate future?
Carlisle: The defense, but the overall challenge for him is broader than that. Throughout his tenure, Klinsmann has tended to oscillate between idealism and pragmatism. The more pragmatic he's been, the better the team has tended to do.
His decision to play two inexperienced center-backs strayed too far toward idealism. There needs to be experience back there as well. Friendlies are the time to be idealistic but the Oct. 9 playoff game and World Cup qualifying aren't. If Klinsmann veers back toward being more pragmatic, issues such as the defense will begin to be sorted out.
Davis: Regaining the belief of his players and the public that he's got the team headed in the right direction. Klinsmann's notoriously obtuse and obstinate approach to dealing with the media won't serve him well between now and Oct. 9. After simply refusing to recognize the evidence in front of him that several of the players he called on time and time again during the Gold Cup were not ready (or good enough) for that stage, he has to find a way to reform the team into an effective unit while at the same time getting players back on board who might not be so inclined. In other words, it's time for Klinsmann to swallow his pride.
Will Tim Howard start in the U.S.'s Confederations Cup playoff match against Mexico?
McIntyre: In the immediate future, a decision will have to be made about what (if any) role Tim Howard will play. From a team perspective, it's obviously that enormous playoff game against Mexico. Given the stakes and the setting, that match will be an incredible spectacle, and the outcome will inspire either agony or euphoria -- nothing in between. Nobody will be talking about Klinsmann's job security if the U.S. wins. And if they lose, nobody will be talking about anything else.
CSKA sad to lose Honda
By Football Italia staff
The President of CSKA Moscow is disappointed to have lost Keisuke Honda to Milan on a free transfer.
The Japanese international will join the Rossoneri next month after his contract with the Russians expired.
“I'm not used to being cheated,” Evgeni Giner told the Russian media. “In June, Milan's representatives told me that they had made no contact with Honda, when, in reality, they spoke to him in February.
“Then Honda and his brother [agent] promised me that they would sign an extension.
“We could have sold Honda to Everton, or to another club, but we couldn't because he just wanted Milan and that is his right.
“I, however, don't think he will play that much over there – although I could be wrong.”

In the pursuit of relevance in Canada's most cluttered metro sports market, the Toronto Argonauts need to think small and slow, not big and fast.
Spending huge marketing dollars is a poor investment for the franchise at this stage. This needs to be a grassroots fix, one fan at a time. It's not sexy, it's not quick, and it won't be easy.
Filming a 30-second spot and hoping it will make rain or buying billboards around Toronto isn't working. More money and more advertising buys won't result in a new flood of Argos fans. They can't be convinced with a slogan or a commercial.
The Argos need to be honest about where they are right now and it isn't a great place. They're at or near the bottom in the market in terms of fan interest.
The Argos need to develop a sustainable way to fill the stadium. The football isn't minor league, but the Argos' place in the Toronto market is that of a second-tier operation. They're currently closer to TFC or the Marlies than they are the Maple Leafs, Blue Jays or Raptors.
That's the perception, so accept it as reality and deal with it. A lot of minor-league franchises flourish in major markets. The Chicago Wolves and St. Paul Saints come to mind.
How do they do it? Group sales.
The Argos have a huge advantage in this area. They need to sell only 10 or so dates per season. Their games are on national television. They have a history and a new stadium.
Fill the place for the next five years by going to companies, school boards and organizations and selling the you-know-what out of the Argos. One hundred tickets at a time. Make the ticket department the heart of the franchise. Hire the person who sells the tickets at the best-run group sales department in Canada or the U.S. and put him or her to work.
They will succeed. It works. It's proven. It's not as easy as opening the doors and having people buy season tickets, but it's the first step.
At the same time, be great both on the field and off.
Don't try to chase an overnight winner. Develop Canadian talent and a young quarterback to build around. It would be nice to have Zach Collaros or Trevor Harris still in the fold, but that's another story.
Traditional media has turned away from the Argos. The reality is shrinking budgets have caused media to turn away from a lot of content. The focus in Toronto goes to the Leafs, Raptors and Jays because those teams drive consumption. The Argos need to accept that media has changed.
Take this responsibility into your own hands. Hire young and talented people to build an NFL-style team website. Make www.argonauts.ca a destination for unique team news and features. No one else in the Toronto marketplace is telling your story, so do it yourself. Use social and digital media to distribute content differently.
The Argos have ownership willing to invest and the patience to keep the operation stable while a brand rebuild takes place. Fill the stadium for a few years with group sales, put a winning product on the field and organically people will start to re-invest in the team, both emotionally and financially.
It's been a 30-year slide to get to this point. Changing stadiums and ownership was never going to create a one-year fix. The Argos were at rock bottom when they limped out of Rogers Centre. It's time to admit this and adjust the way the team thinks of itself as an entity. It's time to find a new basic.

US President Donald Trump has responded to the Jordanian king's request that the United States refrain from moving the US Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Arab media reported on Saturday.
The Palestinian daily Al-Quds reported that the Trump administration transferred a message to the Palestinian Authority that the embassy would not be moving to Jerusalem.
According to the report, top security officials in the Trump administration also spoke with the head of the Palestinian General Intelligence Service, Majid Faraj, to send “reassuring messages” on settlements.But in an interview with the Hebrew daily Israel Hayom, Trump said he had not yet made a decision on whether or not to relocate the embassy.“I am thinking about the embassy, I am studying the embassy [issue], and we will see what happens. The embassy is not an easy decision. It has obviously been out there for many, many years, and nobody has wanted to make that decision. I'm thinking about it very seriously, and we will see what happens,” Trump told the paper. On Wednesday, the foreign ministers of Jordan and Egypt discussed Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem during a meeting in the Jordanian capital Amman.Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman al-Safadi said that Israeli settlements and other issues relating to the conflict were addressed during Jordanian King Abdullah's recent meetings with the new US administration.During the visit, Abdullah raised concerns about Trump's pledge to relocate the American Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.“In our view, Jerusalem is extremely important, our firm stance is that we reject any unilateral efforts that attempt to change the Arab, Muslim and Christian identity of the holy city. This stance has been clearly articulated by his majesty, and we have conveyed our viewpoint on the outcome of any decision that threatens the identity of Jerusalem clearly and honestly to the United States administration,” Safadi said.King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to hold talks with the US administration.Tovah Lazaroff, Jerusalem Post staff and Reuters contributed to this report.

Everywhere of late, people are saying they are sorry. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, for one, after talking ill of his commander in chief. Or the BP chief executive, Tony Hayward, apologizing for the destruction caused by his company's oil well. Or Representative Joe Barton apologizing to Hayward and then apologizing for that apology.
And these were but the most recent mea culpas (or, at least, culpas, some with very little mea). There was also the pope's, for the pain caused to Irish parishioners by pedophile priests; Prime Minister David Cameron's, for the murder by British soldiers of Irish protesters on Bloody Sunday 38 years ago; a Major League umpire for calling a runner safe when he should have been out in the ninth inning, thus depriving a pitcher of a perfect game; a parade of athletes and politicians for using steroids or breaking their marriage vows; and the occasional carmaker for not acting quickly enough to repair faulty systems.
All this apologizing should be good for our collective soul, allowing those who are wrong a chance to repent and those who have been wronged a change to forgive, right? Apologies, says Dr. Aaron Lazare, the former chancellor of the University of Massachusetts Medical School and author of the book “On Apology,” are “the most profound of human interactions.” When used well, the words can heal humiliation — by lifting anger and guilt and allowing splintered bonds to mend.
Or at least that's what they are supposed to do. These days, they more often sound like parodies of their once-powerful selves, and instead of bringing solace, they tend to create more anger.

Hayward said: “I am very, very sorry that this accident occurred, very sorry. . . . And I do believe that it's right to investigate it fully and draw the right conclusions.” But we heard this: “I am sorry it happened, sure, but I am not saying that it was anything we could have prevented.” He also said, “This is a complex accident, caused by an unprecedented combination of failures.” In other words, it wasn't our fault.

Jennifer Robbennolt, a professor of law and psychology at the University of Illinois, calls these kinds of statements “nonapology apologies,” and they are worse, she argues, than no apology at all. In a study she has conducted, she presented test subjects with a hypothetical situation — one in which a cyclist injures a pedestrian. She then attributed one of three statements to the cyclist and asked the subjects whether the injured party should accept a proffered settlement. When a full apology was offered (“I am so sorry that you were hurt. The accident was all my fault, I was going too fast and not watching where I was going”), 73 percent of the respondents said the pedestrian should be willing to accept the settlement. When no apology was offered, 52 percent said the pedestrian should settle. And when only a partial apology was offered (“I am so sorry that you were hurt, and I really hope that you feel better soon”), 35 percent opted for a settlement.
A flag commemorating the 96 dead (via Wikipedia)
Families of those killed at Hillsborough on 15th of April 1989 have been campaigning for justice for 27 years, and today they finally got it. In the question of whether the 96 people who attended a football game at the Hillsborough stadium during the FA Cup semi-final, between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, died unlawfully, a jury responded with 'yes'.
In the proceedings, which are ongoing, the jury had been asked a number of questions regarding whether the fans who died were in part responsible for their own demise. It was decided that due to "gross negligence" by the police and by Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and its staff – the former in their dealing with the situation and the latter with their attitude towards preparing a safe enough environment in the ground – the fans were not in any way responsible for what happened on that day.
In the aftermath of the disaster, blame had been apportioned to the fans by both the South Yorkshire police and The Sun newspaper (in 2012, it admitted what it called its "gravest error" and remains the subject of a Merseyside boycott today). Today, the jury decided that omissions and negligence allowed an excessive amount of people to enter the stadium, which led to crushing. The ambulance service was also named as negligent during the tragedy, as their inability to identify a crisis worsened the already dire situation.
The question with the biggest legal ramifications asked of the jury was Question Six: "Are you satisfied, so that you are sure, that those who died in the disaster were unlawfully killed?"
The coroner, Sir John Goldring, told the jury that they could only answer this question if they believe the South Yorkshire police officer in charge of the event, Ch Supt David Duckenfields, was "responsible for manslaughter". The jury were told this would mean the police's duty of care was breached in such a way that was "so bad, having regard to the risk of death involved" that it was a "criminal act". The jury voted yes on Question Six by a majority of 7-2.
The inquiry was the result of almost 30 years of tireless campaigning by the families of the dead.
The jury adjourned to cheers and cries from the families and survivors, who emerged from the court to meet supporters outside, where they joined in a rendition of "You'll Never Walk Alone". The next part of the inquest will be a play-by-play dissection of the causes of the deaths. We will update this article when we have more information.

From August 27th to October 6th, around the same time its TCG figure box comes out, Keldeo will be distributed to Pokémon Black and White games at Gamestop! It will more than likely match the Keldeo that players can download in Japan right now for having pre-ordered tickets to see Kyurem vs. the Sacred Swordsman – Keldeo: it comes at Level 15 with a PP Max, inside a Cherish Ball, and with the moves Aqua Jet, Leer, Double Kick, and Bubblebeam.
Keldeo learns the move Secret Sword when taken to the Moor of Iccirus with its trio members Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion. When transferred to Black 2 and White 2 and taken to Oath Woods with the three, Keldeo can also be taught Secret Sword but will then transform into its Resolute Form.
The Gamestop promotion ends a day before the release of Pokémon Black 2 and White 2 on October 7th, meaning the Colt Pokémon is being used as a lure to get people to pre-order the games at Gamestop. Marketing! Now we just have to wait for Meloetta's distribution details. (Wi-Fi? Toys R Us?)
Bernie Sanders has narrowed her lead, but Hillary Clinton still has a double-digit advantage among New York voters, says a Siena College poll of likely state presidential primary voters released Wednesday.
Down from a 21-point lead on March 7 among registered Democrats, Clinton's lead in the latest survey is 52 percent to 42 percent. The March 7 poll had Clinton ahead of Sanders 55 percent to 34 percent.
On the Republican side, the poll shows Donald Trump maintaining a huge lead, garnering 50 percent compared with 27 percent for Ohio Gov. John Kasich and 17 percent for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.
In March, Trump led among registered Republicans with 45 percent, followed by Kasich and Marco Rubio, each at 18 percent, and Cruz with 11 percent.
Among Democrats, Sanders ranks slightly more favorable at 75 percent to 20 percent than does Clinton at 73 percent to 25 percent.
Trump is rated slightly more favorable at 58 percent to 38 percent among Republicans, compared with 57 percent to 31 percent for Kasich.
Steven Greenberg, Siena College pollster, said Sanders has extended his lead among state voters age 35 or younger by 17 points. Clinton remained most popular with voters 55 and older, leading by 22 points.

“The younger voters are feeling the ‘Bern' but the question is will they come out and vote in large numbers, as older voters historically do?” Greenberg said.
Clinton also leads among black voters, 62 percent to 31 percent, and Latino voters, 54 percent to 42 percent.
With white voters, Clinton has a 49 percent to 46 percent lead, down from 52 percent to 35 percent last month. Among white women Clinton leads by 18 percentage points and among white men Sanders holds a 2 percentage point edge.
Trump appears an overwhelming winner in his home state, Greenberg said.
“The real question is will he get a majority of Republican votes or simply a very high plurality?” he said. “Currently, exactly half of likely Republican voters are with the Donald, while Kasich is in sole possession of second place.”
Trump leads among women by 19 points and among men with 27 points.
More than two-thirds of Democrats surveyed overwhelmingly think Clinton will be the next president, as do one-third of Republicans.
Among Republican primary voters, 40 percent think Trump will win the election, while 33 percent think it will be Clinton.
The poll was conducted over six days, from last Wednesday to Monday, with telephone calls to 538 likely Democratic primary voters and 469 likely Republican primary voters.
Republicans and Democrats were independently weighted by age, region and gender to reflect known registration patterns and historic voter turnout.

A US pastor has threatened to set himself on fire to stop loving gay couples from being legally recognised.
Texas pastor Rick Scarborough made the claim ahead of an anticipated ruling from the Supreme Court later this month – which could bring same-sex marriage to all 50 states including Texas.
One-upping the Australian Christian couple who have threatened to divorce if the ban on same-sex marriage is lifted, the Texan appared to threaten to burn himself alive.
He said: “We're simply being pre-emptive and saying, no matter what the cost, we are not going to bow, we are not going to bend, and we will burn.”
The preacher also claimed that religious leaders should offer themselves up to be shot dead.
He said: “The preachers need to get out front, the leaders need to get out front, out front of these ordinary citizens and say, ‘Shoot me first'.”
“The end game is the complete destruction of the church of the Lord Jesus, the replacement of it with this liberal theology that's not a theology… it goes back to the Garden of Eden when Satan wanted to be God. We now have a race of humans that don't want to acknowledge that there's a God.
“If the court does rule this, they will have to step over natural law. They're after God. This country better be aware, we've suffered a lot of injustices, but I'm not sure God is going to tolerate this one very long.”
He previously claimed God should drop a nuke on the US, because it appoints gay ambassadors.

The old Hollywood Studio System produced many great works of art from the eternal fable of The Wizard of Oz to the harsh poetry of director John Ford's westerns. Out of this creative environment came film noir, a style of movie-making that became very popular in the 1940's and 1950's. Noir filmmakers used shadowy black and white cinematography and inventive camera angles to make movies filled with crime, lust, betrayal, and the darkness in the human heart.
The old Hollywood Studio System produced many great works of art from the eternal fable of The Wizard of Oz to the harsh poetry of director John Ford's westerns. Out of this creative environment came film noir, a style of movie-making that became very popular in the 1940's and 1950's.
Noir filmmakers used shadowy black and white cinematography and inventive camera angles to make movies filled with crime, lust, betrayal, and the darkness in the human heart. The noir style encompassed many types of films: there are of course murder-mysteries and heist movies, but noirs were also social problem movies, women's pictures and even science fiction.
Today, film noir is more popular than ever. In recent years, classic movie fans have dedicated November, or “Noirvember” if you want to use the social media hashtag, as a month for the study and appreciation of noir, so without further ado here are 10 great movies that shaped the history of American film.
Just a note on the name film noir: This term, which means black film, was coined by French critic Nino Frank in 1946. Most 40's and 50's audiences would not have been familiar with the phrase; instead they would have called these movies murder mysteries and crime movies.
The Maltese Falcon (1941, John Huston)
There's a great deal of debate among film scholars about the first true noir, but, there's no argument that the first significant film in the noir style is The Maltese Falcon. Director John Huston's classic stars Humphrey Bogart as world weary detective Sam Spade, who battles corrupt cops, a gang of thugs, and one wily femme fatale (Mary Astor) to avenge his partner's death and solve the mystery of the falcon.
Based on Dashiell Hammett's popular detective novel, The Maltese Falcon sets the standard for future noirs with shadowy night cinematography, a convoluted story line, a cynical hero and a colorful supporting cast that features great character actors like Peter Lorre, Elisha Cook Jr, and Sydney Greenstreet.
Double Indemnity (1944, Billy Wilder)
The United States entry into World War II in late 1941 halted the development of mainstream noir movies, while the studios focused on making patriotic fare like Yankee Doodle Dandy and Mrs. Miniver. However, maverick screenwriter and director Billy Wilder wasn't afraid to go his own way with an adaptation of James M. Cain's potboiler novel Double Indemnity. The source material was considered so trashy that Wilder's writing partner quit in protest (Wilder replaced him with crime novelist Raymond Chandler), and he had a difficult time persuading stars Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck to sign on as a sleazy insurance agent and his married lover.
Wilder also battled the motion picture censors who nitpicked everything from the script to the length of bath towel Stanwyck wears in her first scene (the towel “should certainly go below her knees” censor Joseph Breen fussed in a studio memo). Once the movie was released, all of these troubles were forgotten. Audiences had grown tired of wholesome fare, and they flocked to see this seamy tale of the dark undercurrents of suburban American life.
Detour (1945, Edgar Ulmer)
While the major studios were largely overlooking the noir style, the poverty row studios were churning out cheaply made noirs with a bare-bones budget and little known actors. One of the best of these B-movies is Detour, a 68 minute thrill ride from criminally underrated director Edgar Ulmer, about a cross-country hitchhiker (Tom Neal) who has a bizarre encounter in the Arizona desert that turns into a living nightmare. In many ways, these B-movies are some of the best examples of the noir style. The cheap sets and production designs forced directors to be creative with cinematography and camera angles. Also, the motion picture censors were not as strict, which allowed B-movies more freedom to cover taboo subjects.
Gilda (1946, Charles Vidor)
Film noir became mainstream in the postwar period. Studios were now willing to sink lots of cash into lavish noirs with big stars. One of the best of the big budget noirs is Gilda, featuring Rita Hayworth in an iconic performance as the ultimate femme fatale. Gilda features lush cinematography by Rudolph Mate, gorgeous costumes from Jean Louis, and Hayworth‘s show-stopping “Put the Blame on Mame” number.
Out of the Past (1947, Jacques Tourneur)
By 1947, American moviegoers were spoiled for choice with a glut of top-notch noirs appearing in cinemas. One week they could view Orson Welles‘ experimental classic, The Lady from Shanghai and then return next week for the low-budget thrills of Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome.
Even among these first rate noirs, director Jacques Tourneur‘s Out of the Past stands alone. It is simply one of the best American films ever made, with Robert Mitchum creating the definitive noir anti-hero as private detective turned gas station owner Jeff Bailey. Even more, Out of the Past is a profound meditation on fate and identity and how we can never escape the shadows in our past.
The Third Man (1949, Carol Reed)
By the late 1940's, noir's influence had spread beyond Hollywood. Many filmmakers outside the United States were experimenting with the noir style, most notably British director Carol Reed. The best of Reed's noirs is The Third Man, the story of a naive American novelist (Joseph Cotten) who visits postwar Vienna to reconnect with his childhood friend Harry Lime (Welles). Reed uses that simple plot to craft a masterpiece of cinematic formalism using the bombed-out streets of the Austrian capital as the setting for a film filled with a dreamlike landscape of light and shadow.
Border Incident (1949, Anthony Mann)
As the noir style became more popular, its boundaries expanded into other genres like the woman's picture and even the western. Director Anthony Mann‘s noir Border Incident is a modern western about illegal immigration along the US/Mexican border. This movie is still quite relevant today with a fast-paced plot about two undercover agents (Ricardo Montalban and George Murphy) who attempt to break up an illegal, but highly profitable human trafficking operation. Mann and cinematographer John Alton use the sparse Southwestern landscape to create images of stark beauty and sheer terror.
The Asphalt Jungle (1950, John Huston)
One of the great innovations of 50's noir was the heist movie. There were many great heist capers during the decade, including Kansas City Confidential and Stanley Kubrick's The Killing, but Huston's The Asphalt Jungle is the granddaddy of them all.
The movie is a taut thriller about a group of Midwestern low lives and criminals who band together to pull off a complicated jewel theft. Terrific performances abound, especially from Sam Jaffe as a criminal mastermind, and a young Marilyn Monroe. But the film's pièce de résistance is a lengthy, suspenseful scene of the gang pulling off the heist itself.
Sunset Boulevard (1950, Billy Wilder)
Noir turned decadent in the 1950's with big name directors like Vincente Minnelli and Alfred Hitchcock transforming the genre to suit their own particular obsessions. Wilder's corrosive Hollywood satire Sunset Boulevard is among the best of these films.
The image of hapless screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) floating dead in silent film star Norma Desmond's (Gloria Swanson) swimming pool is one of the most crackling opening scenes in any noir. Wilder never lets up from there, taking viewers on a wild ride that includes Cecil B. DeMille, a chimpanzee funeral, and the most memorable staircase descent in movie history.
Kiss Me Deadly (1955, Robert Aldrich)
By the late 1950's, noir had largely run its course. There would still be a few proto-noirs produced in the 1960's and 1970's (Chinatown is a good example of this type of film), but the noir style largely ran out of steam. Instead, audiences sought new thrills with teen movies, lavish epics, and low budget horror films. One of the last great noirs was Kiss Me Deadly, which is based on Mickey Spillane's pulp novel.
While the book was about illegal drugs in the L.A. criminal underworld, director Robert Aldrich changed the plot into a cold war parable of nuclear destruction. Detective Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) is very much in the Sam-Spade mold of punch first and ask questions later, but this private eye stumbles across something much worse than the theft of a black bird. In a bravura final scene, Kiss Me Deadly moves from noir into science fiction; Hammer unwittingly sets off a nuclear apocalypse, and in this most nihilistic of noirs, an art form that began in shadows fades into black.
If you're new to noir, these 10 films above are a great introduction, but don't stop there. I've just scratched the surface of the many masterpieces that noir has to offer.

Opinions expressed in our articles are those of the authors and not of the Film Inquiry magazine.
It appears there is more than one point of view on this subject. One, the opinion of Chief Justice Douglas, and two, the FAA's which was defined in the ‘Myth Buster' paper they published, and is as follows:
Myth 1. “The FAA doesn't control airspace below 400 feet.”
Fact: The FAA controls all airspace from the ground up. This myth is based on confusion with the rules for operating model aircraft, which are quite different from those involving any form of commercial flying operations.
Really, from the ground up? This confusion has nothing to do with model aircraft rules. This confusion, on the part of the FAA, has everything to do with Supreme Court Justice Douglas's writing of the majority opinion in United States v. Causby, which states in part:
“We have said that the airspace is a public highway. Yet it is obvious that if the landowner is to have full enjoyment of the land, he must have exclusive control of the immediate reaches of the enveloping atmosphere. The landowner owns at least as much of the space above the ground as the can occupy or use in connection with the land.”
While the “immediate reaches of the enveloping atmosphere” were not defined by Douglas, in Smith v. New England Aircraft Company, the Massachusetts Supreme Court set the boundary somewhere between one hundred feet and five hundred feet.
So the United States Supreme Court does not agree that the FAA controls all airspace from the ground up. While no one is arguing that the FAA should not regulate safety from the ground up, the FAA has no authority to withhold use of this airspace from the landowner, be it for recreational or commercial operations.
Myth 3. Commercial UAS operations are a “gray area” in FAA regulations.
No shades of gray here. From the FAA, “Anyone who wants to fly an aircraft — manned or unmanned — in U.S. airspace needs some level of FAA approval.”
Actually we agree with the FAA on this one. However, since the Supreme Court ruled that, “The landowner owns at least as much of the space above the ground as the can occupy or use in connection with the land.” It is our contention that “the immediate reaches of the enveloping atmosphere” are privately owned airspace, not U.S. airspace. Therefore, The FAA has no authority to exclude the landowner from his/her property, whether for recreation or commercial operations. To do so would be a “taking without compensation” in violation of the fifth amendment of the Constitution.
Myth 4. There are too many commercial UAS operations for the FAA to stop.
Fact: The feds do have to prioritize their enforcement based on level of hazard, however, “When the FAA discovers apparent unauthorized UAS operations, the agency has a number of enforcement tools available to address these operations, including a verbal warning, a warning letter and an order to stop the operation.”
Really, “a verbal warning, a warning letter and an order to stop the operation.” And then what?
Despite these enforcement tools, many continue commercial UAV operations because it is their livelihood. Many were so employed before the 2007 FAA mandate to stop, so what were they to do? They include professional movie cinematographers, high end real-estate photographers, search and rescue organizations and yes, agricultural entities. Very few stopped even when told to do so by the FAA, and no enforcement actions were taken— until the Heurta v. Pirker case. The FAA lost that one, which is still under appeal. I wonder how that's going to work out?
Has the FAA become irrelevant on the the UAV issue? Seven years to promulgate guidance by Advisory Circular or Regulation, and no results so far. Two commercial authorizations, in the Arctic, commanded by Congress. And they haven't faired to well in court either. Maybe Congress should let someone else try?
Myth 5. Commercial UAS operations will be OK after September 30, 2015.
Fact: From the FAA statement: “In the 2012 FAA reauthorization legislation, Congress told the FAA to come up with a plan for ‘safe integration' of UAS by September 30, 2015. Safe integration will be incremental. The agency is still developing regulations, policies and standards that will cover a wide variety of UAS users and expects to publish a proposed rule for small UAS — under about 55 pounds — later this year. That proposed rule will likely include provisions for commercial operations.”
Another missed deadline? On April 1, 2009 [Maybe that date was significant] the FAA co-chaired a report titled: “Small Unmanned Aircraft System Aviation Rulemaking Committee.” [sic] Seventeen organizations contributed, and by consensus developed a very logical document for integrating sUAS into the airspace by groups, i.e. Group II: gross weight under 2 Kilos (4.4 pounds), Max speed under 60 knots, VLOS only, max height 400 feet AGL. It looked promising, however, the NPRM it was supposed to generate hasn't materialized; for five years and counting. The FAA has lost all credibility for predicting when anything will be accomplished. How can we believe them now?
Myth 6. The FAA is lagging behind other countries in approving commercial drones.
Fact: The FAA cited how the comparison is flawed, based on the complexity of U.S. airspace compared with that of other nations.The agency wrote: “Developing all the rules and standards we need is a very complex task, and we want to make sure we get it right the first time.”
Maybe in the northeast corridor, but even that does not equal the airspace congestion of England, for example, where 500 foot vertical separations and special authorizations for use of airports like Heathrow are the norm.
England has a flourishing UAV program, having issued several hundred commercial UAV authorizations. They have also apprehended and successfully prosecuted several offenders.
Yes, the FAA is lagging behind many other countries. Amazon filmed their famous Drone add in Vancouver, because of FAA restrictions. Now, Amazon is thinking of moving their entire Drone R&D program to India because of the onerous FAA restrictions on UAVs here.
Myth 7. The FAA predicts as many as 30,000 drones by 2030.
Fact: That's old data, according to the FAA: “It was an estimate in the FAA's 2011 Aerospace Forecast. Since then, the agency has refined its prediction to focus on the area of the greatest expected growth. The FAA currently estimates as many as 7,500 small commercial UAS may be in use by 2018, assuming the necessary regulations are in place.” Updated numbers are expected with the publication of the FAA's proposed rule on UAS later this year, so stay tuned.
What numbers are we to believe? None of the above? We have no idea where the commercial UAV business will go. Most people think it will be huge, provided the FAA will open up the airspace for commercial operations. Are we missing the boat?
One company in China, DJI, produces only UAVs and related equipment. In 2013 their gross sales was 1.7 million U.S. dollars, and they have over 2000 employees world wide. Not bad for a company that was started by three people in a garage in 2009. Unfortunately, that taxable income and those jobs are not in the United States. Yes, the U.S. is falling behind, due mostly to the FAA's apparently illegal moratorium on commercial UAV operations since 2007.
The FAA needs to return the “the immediate reaches of the enveloping atmosphere” to the landowners before the lawyers learn of this “taking” and the feeding frenzy begins. Besides, it is the right thing to do; and the Supreme Court agrees.
Comments welcome, both positive and negative.

Manchester United's 2016 annual general meeting of shareholders will take place in Philadelphia in June.
The club announced on Friday that the AGM will begin at 3.15pm local time (8.15pm UK time) on June 23 in the offices of law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP.
United face Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final on Saturday to conclude a season that has seen them fail to secure Champions League qualification for 2016-17, having finished fifth in the Premier League.
The future of boss Louis van Gaal has been the subject of considerable speculation all season as talk persists about the possibility of him being replaced by Jose Mourinho this summer.
But while that makes for a shaky-looking picture, United are on course to become the first British club to earn more than half a billion pounds in a single year.
Their third-quarterly financial results released last week showed the Old Trafford outfit expect to earn between £500million and £510m of revenue in 2016.
They announced record third-quarter revenues of £123.4m, up 29.9 per cent on last year, and commercial revenues rose 37.7 per cent to £65.8m.
Broadcasting revenue for the third quarter was £27.8m and matchday revenue came in at £29.8m, with total operating expenses of £102.2m – a 3.2 per cent increase compared to the same quarter last year.
Trial For Ammon Bundy, Oregon Wildlife Refuge Occupiers Set To Begin
Wednesday marks the start of the federal conspiracy trial against militia leader Ammon Bundy and six other defendants who staged an armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. The 41 day anti-federal government occupation capped decades of disputes over how federal public lands are managed in the West.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
In Oregon today, jury selection has begun for the trial of anti-government militia leader Ammon Bundy and six other defendants who staged an armed occupation of a federal wildlife refuge in January. The siege at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in rural eastern Oregon lasted 41 days. NPR's Kirk Siegler covered the refuge occupation this past winter and joins us now. Hey, Kirk.
KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.
SHAPIRO: What charges are the defendants facing?
SIEGLER: Well, there's a litany of charges, but the main one here is federal conspiracy. The government is alleging that the defendants conspired to impede federal officials at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge from doing their jobs. They alleged that they did this through the use of force, threats and intimidation.
SHAPIRO: Give us some context of how this occupation took place. The backstory is not exactly black and white.
SIEGLER: Exactly. So this started as a protest on behalf of two local Oregon cattle ranchers who were convicted of federal arson charges by the Federal Bureau of Land Management, the agency that manages millions of acres of public lands in the West. Now, their case got the attention of the Bundy family down in Nevada. And they're militia supporters who are vehemently opposed to the federal government's management of Western lands.
And led by Ammon Bundy, they drove up to eastern Oregon from around the country actually to protest on behalf of these local ranchers. And at one point some of the militants splintered off and went to the wildlife refuge. Armed, they seized control of it. It was a holiday weekend in winter. It was mostly vacant. And they claim that they're going to, quote, "take the land back" - take the federal land back - and return it to the local people there in Harney County, Ore.
SHAPIRO: The Bundys have a history of defiance against the federal government. Tell us about that.
SIEGLER: At the heart of this, this all comes back to the Bundy family patriarch, Cliven Bundy, Ammon and Ryan Bundy's father - the defendants in this case. He led an armed standoff against the Bureau of Land Management back in 2014 when the government came out to round up his cows that had been illegally grazing on federal land for some 20 years. They came out to round up the cattle, and they eventually had to stand down because Cliven Bundy and his militia supporters - there was a tense standoff there.
And, you know, there's good reason to think that his sons did feel emboldened to do what they did in Oregon because, at that point, it had been almost two years since the Nevada standoff. And the government had not acted against Cliven Bundy. And then we had this Oregon occupation drag on.
SHAPIRO: It dragged on for 41 days. A lot of people asked why authorities didn't just go in and arrest people early on. Any further clarity on that?
SIEGLER: Well, I think there are still some questions. There was a lot of pressure, as you said, at the time for the government to come in and act. You know, it's apparent, though, that the FBI wanted to wait them out. The situation between the government and these militia groups was - and I think you can say still is - as tense as it's been in decades out here in the West. And there was a huge concern of violence. In the end, one militant was killed.
It's not clear whether this movement - this anti-federal government movement - western lands movement - has died down, but it still has its supporters. But what we do know now is that while the occupation was going on, the government was quietly building its case against the militants. As we stood out there each day during their daily news conference out on the snowy, high desert there in Oregon, you know, they'd be speaking their - about their plans and what they were doing on CNN and YouTube, even on their own media channels. And now it's clear that prosecutors are going to use some of those statements they made against them in this trial.
SHAPIRO: Thanks, Kirk.
SIEGLER: Glad to do it, Ari.
SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Kirk Siegler covering the trial in Oregon of the militia leader Ammon Bundy and six other defendants.

Cut
Measure and mark your cuts on each piece of wood. Be precise and remember to do this to ALL pieces before cutting. Think Assembly Line… Cut all wood pieces at the same time. I am using a scroll saw to make all of my cuts. If you are using a bandsaw or miter saw, you'll save even more time.
The body has the most cuts. Look at the template to follow along - Cut a 9" peice. Make a diagonal line that is 2" from the top on one side and 2" from the bottom on the other. Cut along this line. You now have 2 peices to work with. Cut off the small triangle and then rip off the the bottom.
Sand
Same method… Do all before moving on.
Paint
I'm using red, green, gold, silver and black. I am painting the wing red, body and aileron green, struts, axel, prop nose will be gold. Prop will be silver. SO.. everything of the same color gets painted at the same time.
I found and easy way to get the sides of each piece to paint. Using a clamp, I get all of one piece together and clamp. Then you can easily paint all the sides easily without any mess.
After finishing the painting, we added a small Christmas message to the underside of the bottom wing. We kept it tight on the top and bottom to stay away from the wheel to be added later.
There's been significant to talk recently about the tumultuous cryptocurrency markets, and I wanted to share my personal thoughts on the recent news regarding ICOs being banned in China on September 2nd (China timezone). Many misconceptions arose from the confusion caused by the announcement, therefore the central government clarified subsequently on September 6th (China timezone) that:
1. ICO *could* be illegal, and it's status is still under determination
2. China will *temporarily* pause ICO public sales at this moment, but private sales are still allowed. In addition, China will continue to encourage blockchain technologies and expect wide adoption of such technology in the Chinese market.
The blockchain industry in China has made significant progress over the past few years. Over the most recent Labor Day weekend, the cryptocurrency markets were hit hard as news of the ICO ban made its rounds across the internet. However, some people saw the ICO ban as a positive sign for the market. Some believe that over 90% of ICO projects are scams, and ICO participants do not conduct proper due diligence on their investments. In fact, it's quite common to find groups of “Dama” (refers to middle-aged Chinese women with strong purchasing power) who rush into different blockchain ICO seminars after grocery shopping. The increasing appetite for ICOs stems from population groups in China called “Dama” and “Grassroot” (refers to people living in bottom class of Chinese society, therefore “grass”) for making blind purchases and investment. Previously, these groups have been responsible for growth of the China gold market, and they are now shifting away from gold and into cryptocurrency markets.
ICOs are gaining attention as more people participate. However, as one peels the onion, the core impact of ICOs is that it challenges the existing social structure. It allows previously poor to taste the feeling of wealth in a rapid manner. Ether and Bitcoin had very large gains that were not realized by the mainstream wealthy in China. This phenomenon has also circumvented capital restrictions that were released earlier this year, resulting in more RMB flowing out beyond government control. Additionally, some people believe that ICOs may eliminate the need for early-stage venture capital firms, many of whom are controlled and funded by the Chinese government. In addition, as many startups embrace ICOs instead of the traditional Venture route, we are seeing failing companies and startups easily raise millions of dollars. There are many problems, and more will arise if there is not proper regulation.
So far, existing crypto exchanges, public sales platforms and equity researchers who cover cryptos would be suspended for a while. Almost all the ICOs are pulled from the shelf at this moment. For those that have solid government background or initiated by state-owned enterprises would keep within our sights and have more room to grow. Yunbi had finished being audited and posted an official announcement on Yunbi.com on September 5th (PT):
“According to the newly released regulation enacted by People's Republic Bank of China and other seven Chinese government regulators, we decide to take following actions concerning ICO risks:
The following cryptocurrency will be taken off from Yunbi.com: QTUM, GXS, EOS, ANS, DGD, 1ST, GNT, REP, SNT, OMG, PAY, LUN, VEN
The following cryptocurrency will be resumed trading on Yunbi.com: BTC, ETH, ZEC, SC, BCC, ETC, BTS.”
The financial department of China is currently auditing and examining 60 crypto exchanges and platforms involved with ICOs, and ICOAGE.com has been shut down for 3 days. The examination will take some time.
65 ICOs have launched in China this year, raising total of ~$400M dollars (¥2.6 billion RMB). This accounts for roughly 1/4 of the global ICO market. Further regulation on cryptocurrency trading and ICOs will have a significant impact on demand. The current ban may result in following outcomes:
1. Bitcoin and Ether will be valued more, as fewer ICOs are released in China. More ICO releases dilute Bitcoin and Ethereum value and hurt Bitcoin and Ether owners who are the main players in China. Those players witness Bitcoin and Ether price drop before new tokens trading on exchanges.
2. Many ICOs will be delayed until the government adjusts its stance on ICOs, especially for non-Chinese teams that wish to secure easy money. Several US and European teams postponed their crowdfunding to later this year.
3. ICOs and Crowdfunding in general will require greater KYC/ AML processes.
4. Private sales will become the mainstream process for crowdfunding.
5. Exchanges and blockchain startups initiated by the central government or have strong ties with the government are emerging, and may accelerate faster than people expect.
Some ICOs initiated by government-controlled/holding entities have completed their crowdfunding recently. Those teams never claim they are state-owned or government affiliations, but due diligence can easily reveal the connection.
Rules never change. Things that cannot be controlled by government will first be banned, brought under control, and then made legal. However, Bitcoin and other cryptos are similar to the prior Gold and private equity bans encountered in Chinese history. Now, the gold and private equity user base and trading volumes are large. ICO bans may follow a similar path. It's not the first time the legality of cryptocurrency is questioned in China, and each ban has only made cryptos stronger.
What is more interesting is that on Sept 4th, www.gov.cn/xinwen released recent updates about blockchain technology development in China but the article was removed in the next day. The article first indicated a favorable attitude about blockchain technology, and a number of projects were mentioned, including Antshare (NEO)'s recent usage by charity and several updates about government blockchain research labs such as Jiangsu blockchain research lab, Shanghai Fintech center, Guiyang Blockchain Research Lab and several in Shenzhen.
Further, a number of government supported blockchain research labs are undergoing and mainly focus on building a presence in first tier cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hangzhou. A list of government supported blockchain related research labs include (not a complete list):
Central Bank Digital Currency Institute
Zhongguancun Blockchain Research Lab
Jiangsu Blockchain Research Institution
Guiyang Blockchain Research Lab
Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology and Zhaolian Finance
Shanghai Municipal Development and Reform Researches Institute
Financial Blockchain Shenzhen Consortium
Wanxiang Blockchain Lab
Hangzhou Blockchain Research Lab
From the positive article published on Sept 4th and the ICO ban which was announced on Sept 2nd, these opposite tones show two possible scenarios. One possible explanation is that China recognizes the value of blockchain technology but is reluctant to bear the risk of social instability that may occur if there are losses stemming from ICO related investments A second explanation is that the government hasn't unified their approach. There will be another embrace of blockchain and cryptos, once the government determines the best way to regulate them.
Lastly, I leave you with the recent graph charting the roller coaster ride of Ethereum as events unfolded during and after the recent announcements regarding banning and “clarifications” on ICOs in China. Enjoy the ride!

Coinbase is going to add altcoins, which experts say will make life easier for Aussie investors
Updated
You've probably heard the hype about bitcoin or ethereum, but what about cryptocurrencies like neo, dash or ripple?
Key points: Coinbase currently lists only the big three: bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum
Interest has exploded, with one bitcoin now worth $25,000
Investing will become accessible to anyone with a credit card and a phone
From next year, Coinbase — one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges — has announced that a swathe of new altcoins will be added to its platform.
It has come as welcome news for Australian investors who, until now, have been paying a premium on local exchanges.
The interest in bitcoin has exploded as much as its price, with one bitcoin now worth $25,000 and Australians cannot get enough.
Coinbase currently lists three of the world's most popular coins: bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum.
What are altcoins?
There are thousands of cryptocurrencies available — almost everyone has heard of bitcoin and ethereum — altcoins are all of those other currencies.
"[Altcoins] actually often have a lot more functionality, but also they're a lot more specific," said Professor Jason Potts from RMIT University.
The Australian peer-to-peer blockchain-based energy trading platform Power Ledger is a good example of what altcoins are.
Buyers and sellers are able to trade renewable energy, dispensing with the need of a middleperson.
"If you want to trade energy peer to peer you use a particular token for that," Professor Potts said.
While there are Australian exchanges that sell altcoins, they charge a premium price.
So Australian investors who want a better price often have to sign up to a US-exchange and learn how to trade coins like shares.
But now, with Coinbase's decision, investing will become accessible to anyone with a credit card and a phone.
"What it does is it makes it easier to access a wider variety of crypto assets, in the sense that you're not just constrained to the big two or three — like litecoin, ethereum and bitcoin," Professor Potts said.
"You've now got the same level of access to a much wider range of these."
While Coinbase has yet to announce which currencies they will be adding, Professor Potts said the result would likely see more Australian cash flowing into the cryptocurrency world.
"It will happen everywhere and I think we can just see this as a reallocation of Australian households investment portfolios," he said.
'Much easier for the average investor'
Alex Saunders made so much money in cryptocurrencies that he decided to quit his job to work full time as an investor.
But he also helps other investors through his Youtube channel Nugget's News Australia, which is dedicated to answering cryptocurrency questions.
Mr Saunders said at any time of the day or night, he has someone asking him about bitcoin.
"I'm getting tagged in hundreds of things a day now, and messages to my Facebook, comments on YouTube, questions left right and centre," he said.
And he said Australian investors were excited about Coinbase's announcement.
"For the average investor that's not too tech savvy, downloading that app on their phone is just going to be such an easy way to get into these new coins," he said.
"Rather than having to sign up with different websites and manage more passwords and having the stress of all those different options to get your head around."

The so-called Australian "birthers", a nod to similar US right-wing attacks against President Barack Obama, have been claiming in blogs and on social media for months that Mr Abbott, who was born in London but emigrated to Australia as a child, is a dual citizen.
Section 44 of the constitution forbids dual citizens from becoming MPs and states that any person who is a "subject or a citizen . . . of a foreign power" shall be "incapable of being chosen" as a member of either house.
Police in Japan Give Cyclists Free Raincoats
Japan's rainy season is here, it started raining last Thursday literally has not stopped as I write this on Sunday.Naturally in a country that relies upon the bicycle for transport as strongly as Japan a little rain, not even a solid month of tropical rainstorms, is going to stop people from cycling. You can't just hang up your bike till the rainy season ends when the bicycle is your primary means of transport.This means that people cycling while holding umbrellas are out in force, on the streets, on the pavement, battling the rain, and wind. This disturbs the local constabulary as on the books cycling while holding an umbrella (and technically cycling one handed) is against the law.But people must cycle, and people will cycle through the rainy season regardless of what the law says, and as the Japanese police would face publish backlash if they started enforcing cycling laws they've not enforced for decades they've had to come up with an alternative plan of action.On June 5 a group of volunteers gathered at Saitama's JR Musashi Urawa station handing out free raincoats , and bicycle safety pamphlets to all cyclists they noticed cycling with umbrellas.While I personally think there is nothing wrong with a responsible adult cycling while holding an umbrella, I have to tip my hat to the Saitama Prefectural Police Department for coming up with a campaign that doesn't punish cyclists, but presents them with a valid alternative, offering them an opportunity to change their behaviour.Not often I say this about the Japanese police force, but well done!While on the topic of umbrellas, if you do insist on cycling while holding an umbrella, especially at night, you may want to try the illuminated Bright Light umbrella which has two krypton lamps inside that light the area beneath the umbrella. With six designs available its a steal at ¥4090 for adults and ¥3070 in children's sizes.
It was said to be the greatest collection of 20th century typography ever assembled. How it wound up in the trash near Bloor Street is a forgotten bit of Toronto history. Book jackets, record covers, newspapers — “even a Playboy cover,” — all of these beguiling bits of type, painstakingly crafted, came to Toronto from around the world, for the prestigious Typomundus 20 competition.

After the judging, the collection of 10,000 items was stored in a “dingy” Bloor St. East rooming house, and when someone forgot to pay the rent, the items were thrown out by the landlord, who mistook the boxes for junk. “And the only collection of its scope ever attempted went to the incinerator in a truck marked, “Bill's Pick Up,” wrote Star reporter Robert Johnstone in 1965. Hugh Michaelson was home with the flu when the story ran and can still remember the headline: “Oh what a typographical error!”

As the executive director of the competition, he had been fielding calls from the Toronto Telegram, Canadian Press and a German newspaper, asking if the story in the Star — where he worked as the art director — was true. “Now I'm done for it,” he thought.
A Toronto Star story detailing the loss of the competition entries had the effect of restoring quite a few: objects pilfered by locals while boxes of the entries awaited transport to a city incinerator.
TYPOGRAPHY IS so ubiquitous that many of us don't notice it. You may see a heritage building and read about the architect, but you might not know the history of a commonly used font like Times New Roman, or recognize the Highway Gothic font on Ontario's road signs, designed for maximum legibility and fast recognition. Typography, as defined by the Oxford dictionary, is the art or work of designing how text will appear when it is printed.
The “rumblings” of what would become a burgeoning Canadian scene started after the Second World War, says Rod McDonald, who has designed several typefaces but was a “bit too young” to be part of Typomundus 20. “By the end of the '50s into the '60s — it's a typical Canadian story, of course — we had a huge number of immigrants from both Germany and England who were highly skilled and well trained, and they're the people that really put typography on the map in Canada,” McDonald says from his home in Nova Scotia.

One of these newcomers, Leslie “Sam” Smart, complained that Canadian printing was “where England was in the 1930s and where Switzerland and Germany were in the 1920s,” in an article in the Globe and Mail. Smart was one of the designers who created the Society of Typographic Designers of Canada (TDC) in the late 1950s to improve the craft in Canada. It was a time when corporations were becoming more design-conscious, and when it came to typography, there were only a select few who had the knowledge and access to the very technical process of composing metal blocks of type. It was both an art form and a skill — the strategic use of spacing, type and layout were transformative. “What we do today seems so easy digitally,” says Errol Saldanha, a Toronto designer. “Any publication in those days was such a manually intensive thing.” “Types manifest the riches of our souls … During thousands of years, with toil and trouble, forms were developed which rendered our world richer and more beautiful,” typographer Horst Erich Wolter wrote in Typomundus 20. “Typography is not merely the application of types. It requires a clear comprehension of content, which leads to an improved communication of words.” Pat Gangnon was the first woman to join the TDC after she graduated in the early '60s. Meetings were fun — they smoked and had a few drinks — it was the sixties, a Mad Men kind of scene. “I felt honoured to be with all these people who were very good designers. They were really the front bumper of the movement in Canada,” she says. “They were a very determined crew. They were going to improve typography in Canada.” Saldanha, who researched Canada's design history, said many industry pioneers told him that Canada came to be considered leading edge in the '60s. “European magazines were showcasing what was going on here,” he says In 1963, Aaron Burns and the New York-based International Center for the Typographic Arts (ICTA) called for entries for Typomundus 20, an exhibition to showcase the greatest typography of the 20th century. The jury consisted of a who's-who of the design world — people who had designed pavilions for World's Fairs, art directors for magazines, the director of advertising at CBS.

Judging was supposed to happen in New York, but at the height of the Cold War, U.S. officials refused entry visas for judges behind the Iron Curtain, “despite my pleas in person before State Department officials in Washington, D.C,” writes ICTA cofounder Klaus Schmidt, 86, in an email using Palatino typeface, designed by Typomundus judge Hermann Zapf. “As a typographer,” Schmidt adds as a friendly aside to the reporter, “I have always preferred a classic, ‘warm' Roman face. Your Arial is a ‘cold', modern sans-serif.” (Monotype's version of the ubiquitous Helvetica). Hermann, a good friend of mine, is now 96 years old!!” With the Cold War putting an end to the New York venue, the show was moved to Toronto, where a dynamic typography community was keen to help, and Michaelson was put in charge as executive director. (Michaelson on Arial: “Yuck. Terrible.”) 10,000 entries were sent to seven assembly points around the world, and those were later catalogued, crated, and sent to Toronto. In October 1964, the judges spent 10 days at Toronto's Board of Education building, cigarettes and pipes in their mouths, plumes of smoke frozen in the camera's flash — so say the photos preserved at Massey College's Roberston Davies Library. What they saw before them, they would later say, showed the technological advances of their times, the “cool and documentary” typography of the Swiss, the avant-garde entries from the 1920s, and the more clear and functional designs of their own era. Gangnon, then in her 20s, was an interpreter for a French judge. She says a few of the judges were a “little haughty,” the kind who might look over your shoulder to see if there was someone more important around — but the majority were very nice. German judge Anton Stankowski was a “lovely big guy,” who came back from a Toronto shopping trip with a Canada goose carving, saying “Canada Duck,” in his thick German accent. “We had one man from Zurich who had a heart attack during the show; he had to be hospitalized,” she says. Every day, helpers laid out batches of items on long tables dotted with ashtrays, and the men walked around with handfuls of Smarties in their hands. “We had a paper cup turned upside down, with a slot cut in it, and we gave these guys Smarties,” Michaelson said, laughing. “That was our voting system: you like it, put a Smartie in the cup.” The 600 or so exhibits that received a majority vote of seven Smarties were to be included in the book Typomundus 20. Six exhibits out of the 10,000 received a unanimous 12-Smartie nod of excellence. At his Oshawa home, 80-year-old Michaelson taps the book on his kitchen table, where the words are rendered in a strong, graphic font. “Pistilli Roman,” he says with the quickness of a game show contestant. Two of his designs are in the book, and he goes to retrieve the old newsprint from another room. A Toronto Daily Star page for Canada Day: half the page devoted to an illustration of a rose, the other half, a rectangle of text, sparse and elegant. The other winning entry was a piece for the entertainment pages. “Hugh was a wonderful designer; he did some lovely work for the Star,” says Pat Gangnon, who remembers Michaelson in those days as a “real cowboy.” “He was just outspoken, and very self assured,” she explains. “Somehow I think of him wearing working boots and taking big steps.”

In his kitchen in blue jeans and a gingham shirt, Michaelson returns to the Typomundus book and stops at a page: “Material not available” it reads, listing 17 books that were lost after the judging. “There must have been a lot of Germans living there,” he says, veering back toward the disaster. The committee had to catalogue the winners for the book, and stored all 10,000 entries, including approximately 600 of the winners, at an apartment near Bloor and Sherbourne. The trouble came when the treasurer got “caught up in Christmas time,” and forgot to mail the rent, Michaelson explains. “A month after the cheque was due, he (the landlord) threw all the stuff out and rented it to a young lady.” Hartley Robins, a lawyer who handled the rental for the landlord, told the Star in 1965 that the rent was paid until Dec. 12. “On the 15th the landlord walked in. The door wasn't even locked, he saw no one there, just some boxes in the room, and he moved them out into the hall and rented the room,” he told the Star in 1965. Fifty years later, Robins doesn't really recall the specifics. His father owned the buildings, and there were some tenants who hadn't paid rent and abandoned their things. “If they left things and didn't pick them up, I think we kept them for a while and then threw them out — that's what would have been the normal case,” he says. “These beautiful archival copies of newspaper pages, and handmade books, and absolutely beautiful work,” recalls Gangnon, wistfully. “Certainly nothing in there, if I recall, looked worth keeping,” Robins says. The fire department ordered the boxes removed, and city garbagemen wouldn't take them, so a cartage man was called to take them to the city incinerator, the Star reported in 1965.
Klaus Schmidt, co founder of ICTA, came to Toronto for Typomundus 20 in 1964.
Michaelson learned all this when Al Sudden, from Massey College, went to the room to pick up the “rejects” for the archives. “My phone rings. It's Al saying, ‘What the hell is going on? I go in there with a key to open it up and I walk in there, and it's now a bedroom and there's a naked lady asleep on the bed.'” “The first thing that came out of my mind was probably a four-letter expletive,” Michaelson says of his reaction. “I got up there and I almost felt sick.” “IT'S BEYOND comprehension how this could happen,” Aaron Burns, the director of the International Centre for Typographic Arts in New York, told the Star in January 1965, “just beyond comprehension ... ” Michaelson remembers phoning Burns in New York. “You're going to have my resignation tomorrow,” he said. “No we're not,” Michaelson recalls him saying. After the stories were published in Europe, there was one “irate contestant,” Michaelson remembers. And then, something unexpected happen. “We started getting phone calls; the local residents had gone around and looked at all these piles of stuff and picked up what they wanted,” he says. “A lot of them were accusing each other of taking it,” Gangnon says of the locals. “I went once … we had retrieved a lot of it out of the garbage. A lot of it had totally disappeared; whether it went into the garbage dump or what we don't know.” “They had fortunately photographed a lot of it beforehand,” she says. Michaelson said they were able to rebuild with the material gathered from the locals. In addition, some entrants were able to resubmit copies of their work for the book. It was finally published in 1966, missing 77 exhibits. A travelling show was exhibited in Canada, USA and many other countries around the world, to high acclaim. “The ‘accident' never really became too well known in typographic circles, except for being mentioned in the book and to those who had to submit replacements,” Schmidt writes. For those who know of Typomundus 20, it is remembered as both a great achievement and an amazing disaster. The calamity part of the event has become the stuff of lore: with various retellings, including a scramble through the trash, a dumpster dive, and the naked lady telling the Typomundus crew to “get the hell out.” When asked if he'd like to put out a call for any German books found in the trash around Bloor and Sherbourne in 1965, Michaelson waves his arms back and forth. “No, no, no,” he says. “I have enough as it is.”
Donald Trump took an unprovoked slap at George W. Bush in an interview broadcast Friday, blaming the former U.S. president for not preventing the 9/11 terror attacks.
Asked by Bloomberg Television anchor Stephanie Ruhle how Americans might trust him to keep them safe, the Republican presidential front-runner bristled at the mention of Bush's role as comforter-in-chief after 9/11, and President Barack Obama's similar position following the December 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. 'OK, I think I have a bigger heart than all of them,' he said. 'I think I'm much more competent than all of them.' 'When you talk about George Bush – I mean, say what you want, the World Trade Center came down during his time.' Scroll down for video 'I'M MUCH MORE COMPETENT': Trump said of President George W. Bush that 'Say what you want, the World Trade Center came down during his time' COMFORTER-IN-CHIEF: Trump suggested he is smarter than the former president, pictured here on Sept, 14, 2001 in an inspiring moment atop the World Trade Center's rubble PUSHBACK: Jeb Bush leapt to his older brother's defense after Trump blamed him for the 9/11 terror attacks Ruhle jumped in, saying, 'Hold on! You can't blame George Bush for that.' 'He was president, OK?' Trump responded. 'Don't blame him, or don't blame him, but he was president. The World Trade Center came down during his reign.' 'If you look at Sandy Hook, those people are still begging for help. It's a disaster, and it's a disaster all over the place.' 'Government has proven to be a disaster during the Obama administration,' Trump pivoted. 'What we need is a leader, we don't have a leader.' Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, one of Trump's rivals for the GOP presdiential nomination, leapt to Twitter to defend his older brother. 'How pathetic for @realdonaldtrump to criticize the president for 9/11,' Jeb wrote. 'We were attacked & my brother kept us safe.' MSNBC host Chris Hayes, a liberal firebrand, responded on the social media platform: 'The first part of the second sentence is true.'

A FORMER police officer is suing the Lothian and Borders force, claiming a training exercise left her scared of sirens.
Louise McGarva is seeking £500,000, alleging she suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after taking part in a simulated riot that spiralled out of control. She said she had been left with a fear of police cars and sirens after being crushed during the riot training in a former hospital building in West Lothian.
Lawyers for the 35-year-old allege that eight officers were left injured during the exercise after their instructors attacked them with “baseball bats, long batons and martial arts”, using “excessive” force.
Ms McGarva said she repeatedly passed out after being crushed in the melee while an officer giving her medical assistance allegedly told her she had “had it” and was going to die.
The former officer, who retired on grounds of ill-health, said the incident left her suffering from nightmares and flashbacks, as well as depression and panic attacks, and she needed psychological treatment at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital.
Police chiefs deny that the course had descended into a real-life riot, and contend that Ms McGarva already had a “history of psychological injury”, including the need for stress counselling following her involvement in a child death inquiry in 2004.
Ms McGarva launched the legal action, against Chief Constable David Strang, at the Court of Session in Edinburgh alleging that the course's instructors were negligent.
Ms McGarva, who had been a police officer for 11 years, was sent on a two-day public order course taking place at the former Bangour Village Hospital in May 2007.
Nine instructors took the role of rioters whom the 21 officer students had to “control and restrain”.
After undergoing a day of training, Ms McGarva and her fellow students had to enter the hospital and detain the “rioters”.
But lawyers for Ms McGarva said the role-playing instructors “ambushed” their team, causing the police team's response to “immediately dissolve into disarray”.
She said the instructors attacked them with baseball bats and baton, as well as using martial arts. The police team pushed forward up a stairwell “en masse”, a tactic her lawyers contend was “inappropriate and unsafe” and likely to cause “crush injuries”.
As two officers were injured and taken away, Ms McGarva said she was lifted off her feet by the surge and her windpipe constricted after her helmet strap was pulled up.
Ms McGarva said she passed out and the exercise was finally brought to a halt with eight officers injured.
Ms McGarva feared she was paralysed and about to die, and said she overhead an officer debating whether to move her to a vehicle, but said they “would not be covered if she died in the van”.
Although she did not require hospital treatment that day, lawyers for Ms McGarva said she was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suffered from a “major depressive disorder” until March 2008 before retiring on ill-health grounds in February 2009. They contend she remains unable to work as a result and is suing for the loss of past and future earnings along with damages.
Lawyers for the force argue that Ms McGarva had suffered psychological injuries before the riot training, and also contend that she was fit to work from early 2009 at least.
They added that the instructors had all undergone courses in giving public order training.
A police spokeswoman said it would be inappropriate to comment.
A lipogram (from Ancient Greek: λειπογράμματος, leipográmmatos, "leaving out a letter") is a kind of constrained writing or word game consisting of writing paragraphs or longer works in which a particular letter or group of letters is avoided—usually a common vowel, and frequently E, the most common letter in the English language.[1] Larousse defines a lipogram as a "literary work in which one compels oneself strictly to exclude one or several letters of the alphabet".[2] Extended Ancient Greek texts avoiding the letter sigma are the earliest examples of lipograms.[3]
Writing a lipogram may be a trivial task when avoiding uncommon letters like Z, J, Q, or X, but it is much more challenging to avoid common letters like E, T, or A, as the author must omit many ordinary words. Grammatically meaningful and smooth-flowing lipograms can be difficult to compose. Identifying lipograms can also be problematic, as there is always the possibility that a given piece of writing in any language may be unintentionally lipogrammatic. For example, Poe's poem The Raven contains no Z, but there is no evidence that this was intentional.
A pangrammatic lipogram is a text that uses every letter of the alphabet except one. For example, "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" omits the letter S, which the usual pangram includes by using the word jumps.
History [ edit ]
Lasus of Hermione, who lived during the second half of the sixth century BCE, is the most ancient author of a lipogram. This makes the lipogram, according to Quintus Curtius Rufus, "the most ancient systematic artifice of Western literature".[4] Lasus did not like the sigma, and excluded it from one of his poems, entitled Ode to the Centaurs, of which nothing remains; as well as a Hymn to Demeter, of which the first verse remains:[4]
Δάματρα μέλπω Κόραν τε Κλυμένοι᾽ ἄλοχον μελιβόαν ὕμνον ἀναγνέων Αἰολίδ᾽ ἂμ βαρύβρομον ἁρμονίαν
Dámatra mélpô Kóran te Klyménoi᾽ álochon melibóan hýmnon anagnéôn Aiolíd᾽ ám barýbromon armonían
This translates to:
I chant of Demeter and Kore, Wife of the famed [Pluto] Lifting forth a gentle-voiced hymn In the deep-toned Aeolian mode.[5]
The late antiquity Greek poets Nestor of Laranda and Tryphiodorus wrote lipogrammatic adaptations of the Homeric poems: Nestor composed an Iliad, which was followed by Tryphiodorus' Odyssey.[6] Both Nestor's Iliad and Tryphidorous' Odyssey were composed of 24 books (like the original Iliad and Odyssey) each book omitting a subsequent letter of the Greek alphabet. Therefore, the first book omitted alpha, the second beta, and so forth.[3]
Twelve centuries after Tryphiodorus wrote his lipogrammatic Odyssey, in 1711, the influential London essayist and journalist Joseph Addison commented on this work (although it had been lost), arguing that "it must have been amusing to see the most elegant word of the language rejected like "a diamond with a flaw in it" if it was tainted by the proscribed letter".[7]
Piere de Riga, a canon of Sainte-Marie de Reims during the 11th century, translated the Bible, and due to its scriptural obscurities called it Aurora. Each canto of the translation was followed by a resume in Lipogrammic verse; the first canto has no A, the second has no B, and so on. There are two hundred and fifty manuscripts of Piere de Riga's Bible still preserved.[8]
There is a tradition of German and Italian lipograms excluding the letter R dating from the seventeenth century until modern times. While some authors excluded other letters, it was the exclusion of the R which ensured the practice of the lipogram continued into modern times. In German especially, the R, while not the most prevalent letter, has a very important grammatical role, as male relatives include an R (e.g. er, der, dieser, jener, welcher).[9] For the Italian authors, it seems to be a profound dislike of the letter R which prompted them to write lipograms excluding this letter (and often only this letter).[10]
There is also a long tradition of vocalic lipograms, in which a vowel (or vowels) is omitted. This tends to be the most difficult form of the lipogram. This practice was developed mainly in Spain by the Portuguese author Alonso de Alcala y Herrera who published an octavo entitled Varios efetos de amor, en cinco novelas exemplares, y nuevo artificio para escrivir prosa y versos sin una de las letras vocales. From Spain, the method moved into France[11] and England.[10]
One of the most remarkable examples of a lipogram is Ernest Vincent Wright's novel Gadsby (1939), which has over 50,000 words but not a single letter E.[12] Wright's self-imposed rule prohibited such common English words as the and he, plurals ending in -es, past tenses ending in -ed, and even abbreviations like Mr. (since it is short for Mister) or Rob (for Robert). Yet the narration flows fairly smoothly, and the book was praised by critics for its literary merits.[13][14]
Wright was motivated to write Gadsby by an earlier four-stanza lipogrammatic poem of another author.[15]
Even earlier, Spanish playwright Enrique Jardiel Poncela published five short stories between 1926 and 1927, each one omitting a vowel; the best known are "El Chofer Nuevo" ("The new Driver"), without the letter A, and "Un marido sin vocación" ("A Vocationless Husband"), without the E.[16][17]
Interest in lipograms was rekindled by Georges Perec's novel La Disparition (1969) (openly inspired by Wright's Gadsby) and its English translation A Void by Gilbert Adair.[12] Both works are missing the letter E, which is the most common letter in French and in English. A Spanish translation instead omits the letter A, the second most common letter in that language. Perec subsequently wrote Les revenentes (1972), a novel that uses no vowels except for E. Perec was a member of Oulipo, a group of French authors who adopted a variety of constraints in their work. La Disparition is, to date, the longest lipogram in existence.[18]
Analysing lipograms [ edit ]
Lipograms are sometimes dismissed by academia. "Literary history seems deliberately to ignore writing as practice, as work, as play".[19]
In his book Rethinking Writing, Roy Harris notes that without the ability to analyse language, the lipogram would be unable to exist. He argues that "the lipogram would be inconceivable unless there were writing systems based on fixed inventories of graphic units, and unless it were possible to classify written texts on the base of the presence or absence of one of those units irrespective of any phonetic value it might have or any function in the script. He then continues on to argue that as the Greeks were able to invent this system of writing as they had a concept of literary notation. Harris then argues that the proof of this knowledge is found in the Greek invention of "a literate game which consists, essentially, in superimposing the structure of a notation on the structure of texts".[20]
Pangrammatic lipogram [ edit ]
A pangrammatic lipogram or lipogrammatic pangram uses every letter of the alphabet except one. An example omitting the letter E is:[21]
A jovial swain should not complain Of any buxom fair Who mocks his pain and thinks it gains To quiz his awkward air.
A longer example is Fate of Nassan, an anonymous poem dating from pre-1870, where each stanza is a lipogrammatic pangram using every letter of the alphabet except E.[22]
Bold Nassan quits his caravan,
A hazy mountain grot to scan;
Climbs jaggy rocks to find his way,
Doth tax his sight, but far doth stray.
Not work of man, nor sport of child
Finds Nassan on this mazy wild;
Lax grow his joints, limbs toil in vain—
Poor wight! why didst thou quit that plain?
Vainly for succour Nassan calls;
Know, Zillah, that thy Nassan falls;
But prowling wolf and fox may joy
To quarry on thy Arab boy.
Dropping letters [ edit ]
Another type of lipogram, which omits every instance of a letter from words that would otherwise contain it, as opposed to finding other words that do not contain the letter, was recorded by Willard R. Espy in 181 Missing O's.[23]
N mnk t gd t rb r cg r plt. N fl s grss t blt Sctch cllps ht. Frm Dnjn's tps n rnc rlls. Lgwd, nt Lts, flds prt's bwls. Bx tps, nt bttms, schl-bys flg fr sprt.

Note that the above is also a conventional lipogram in omitting the letters A, E, I and U.
American author James Thurber wrote The Wonderful O (1957), a fairy tale in which villains ban the letter 'O' from use by the inhabitants of the island of Oooroo.
The book Ella Minnow Pea by Mark Dunn (2001) is described as a "progressively lipogrammatic epistolary fable": the plot of the story deals with a small country which begins to outlaw the use of various letters as the tiles of each letter fall off of a statue. As each letter is outlawed within the story, it is (for the most part) no longer used in the text of the novel. It is not purely lipogrammatic, however, because the outlawed letters do appear in the text proper from time to time (the characters being penalized with banishment for their use) and when the plot requires a search for pangram sentences, all twenty-six letters are obviously in use. Also, late in the text, the author begins using letters serving as homophones for the omitted letters (i.e., PH in place of an F, G in place of C), which some might argue is cheating. At the beginning of each chapter, the alphabet appears along with a sentence, "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog". As the letters are removed from the story, the alphabet and sentence changes.
Chapter 1: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog". Chapter 2: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY* "The quick brown fox jumps over the la*y dog". Chapter 3: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP*RSTUVWXY* "The *uick brown fox jumps over the la*y dog". Chapter 4: ABCDEFGHI*KLMNOP*RSTUVWXY* "The *uick brown fox *umps over the la*y dog".[24]
Other examples [ edit ]
Cipher and Poverty (The Book of Nothing), a book by Mike Schertzer (1998), is presented as the writings of "a prisoner whose world had been impoverished to a single utterance ... .who can find me here in this silence". The poems that follow use only the vowels A, E, I, and O, and consonants C, D, F, H, L, M, N, R, S, T, and W, taken from that utterance.
Eunoia, a book written by Canadian author Christian Bӧk (2001), is lipogrammatic. The title uses every vowel once. Each of the five chapters in this book is a lipogram. The first chapter in this book uses only words containing the vowel "A" and no other vowel. The second chapter uses only words with no vowel but "E", and so on.[25]
In December 2009, a collective of crime writers, Criminal Brief, published eight days of articles as a Christmas-themed lipogrammatic exercise.[26]
In June 2013, finance author Alan Corey published "The Subversive Job Search",[27] a non-fiction lipogram that omitted the letter "Z".[28]
In the ninth episode of the ninth season of How I Met Your Mother, "Platonish", Lily and Robin challenge Barney to obtain a girl's phone number without using the letter E.
A website called the Found Poetry Review asked each of its readers (as part of a larger series of challenges) to compose a poem avoiding all letters in the title of the newspaper that had already been selected. For example, if the reader was using the Washington Post, then they could not use the letters A, G, H, I, N, O, P, S, T, and W.[29]
Non-English examples [ edit ]
The seventh- or eighth-century Dashakumaracharita by Daṇḍin includes a prominent lipogrammatic section at the beginning of the seventh chapter. Mantragupta is called upon to relate his adventures. However, during the previous night of vigorous lovemaking, his lips have been nibbled several times by his beloved; as a result they are now swollen, making it painful for him to close them. Thus, throughout his narrative, he is compelled to refrain from using any labial consonants (प,फ,ब,भ,म).
In France, J. R. Ronden premièred la Pièce sans A (The Play without A) in 1816.[30] Jacques Arago wrote in 1853 a version of his Voyage autour du monde (Voyage around the world), but without the letter a.[31] Georges Perec published in 1969 La Disparition, a novel without the letter e, the most commonly used letter of the alphabet in French. Its published translation into English, A Void, by Gilbert Adair, won the Scott Moncrieff Prize in 1995.[32]
In Sweden a form of lipogram was developed out of necessity at the Linköping University. Because files were shared and moved between computer platforms where the internal representation of the characters Å, Ä, Ö, å, ä, and ö (all moderately common vowels) were different, the tradition to write comments in source code without using those characters emerged.[citation needed]
Zanzō ni Kuchibeni o (1989) by Yasutaka Tsutsui is a lipogrammatic novel in Japanese. The first chapter is written without the syllable あ, and usable syllables decrease as the story advances. In the last chapter, the last syllable, ん, vanishes and the story is closed.
Zero Degree (1991) by Charu Nivedita is a lipogrammatic novel in Tamil. The entire novel is written without the common word ஒரு (oru, "one", also used as the indefinite article), and there are no punctuation marks in the novel except dots. Later the novel was translated into English.[clarification needed]
Russian 18th-century poet Gavriil Derzhavin avoided the harsh R sound (and the letter Р that represents it) in his poem "The Nightingale" in order to render the bird's singing.
The seventh-century Arab theologian Wasil ibn Ata gave a sermon without the letter rāʾ (R).[33]
Non-literary lipograms [ edit ]
While a lipogram is usually limited to literary works, there are also chromatic lipograms, works of music that avoid the use of certain notes. Examples avoiding either the second, sixth, and tenth notes, or the third, seventh, and eleventh notes in a chromatic scale have been cited.[34]
A reverse lipogram is a type of constrained writing where each word must contain a particular letter in the text. In this sense it is the opposite of a lipogram. It is also referred to as antilipo.[35]
Muni sickout continues for 2nd day
Cable Cars sit idle at the historic Cable Car Barn and Powerhouse on June 3, 2014 in San Francisco, California. For the second day in a row, San Francisco commuters are facing long delays as San Francisco Municipal Transit Agency (MUNI) transit workers continue a sickout to protest against a rejected labor contract. More than half of the city's buses and trains are out of service and the famed San Francisco Cable Cars are not running. less Cable Cars sit idle at the historic Cable Car Barn and Powerhouse on June 3, 2014 in San Francisco, California.

It was another tumultuous day for San Francisco commuters, as half the 600 drivers of buses, trains and cable cars who usually show up for work called in sick Tuesday, the outgrowth of an impasse in contract negotiations between management and labor.
The public transit system's worst labor disruption in decades could continue on Wednesday - even though an unusually combative Mayor Ed Lee has directed the city's Human Resources Department to investigate each worker who has called in sick.
The mass absence flouts a law that bans Muni employees from striking. But since it's a wildcat action, union leaders are emphatic in saying that they had nothing to do with making it happen and, therefore, cannot call it off.
"The union has no part in what's going on," said Eric Williams, president of Local 250-A of the Transport Workers Union, which represents 2,000 Muni employees. "Our members are truly frustrated at being treated like they don't matter."
The situation on city streets was better Tuesday than Monday, but not by much. Many commuters complained of at least hour-long waits to board sporadically arriving buses and trains.
Tourists, meanwhile, could only look forlornly at empty cable car turnarounds again, with the service completely shut down for another day. Shuttle buses were available, but it's not the same.
Arbitrator's meeting
The disruption conceivably could continue through the end of the week. By Saturday, an arbitrator is scheduled to meet with negotiators from labor and management.
Politicians and business groups, meanwhile, sounded off against the unofficial protest.
"These are good jobs at Muni - $32 an hour is nothing to sneeze at," Lee said. "They're causing pain to a lot of other people who are just trying to get to work. ... It is causing a tremendous amount of anger from the public."
The mayor said that any worker who cannot prove to the city's Human Resources staff that he or she was ill would lose pay and potentially face suspension or termination.
There was also dismay in a statement released by Supervisor Malia Cohen, who represents neighborhoods in the city's southeast corner.
"My constituents rely heavily on Muni and do not have the luxury of easily walking to other regional alternatives such as BART," Cohen said. "Once again, thousands of San Franciscans lost time and money - and maybe even their jobs - because too many Muni drivers failed to show up for work."
The friction point in the current contract involves the amount of money that workers will pay into their pensions.
The two-year contract proposed by the Municipal Transportation Agency would give Muni workers 11.25 percent in raises while requiring them to pick up a 7.5 percent pension payment now paid by the MTA. But Williams said the apparent gain is illusory, since the employees in 2011 were required to start paying 3.5 percent of their salaries into pensions.
Strike ban
Muni workers, like all San Francisco city employees, are prohibited from striking. Under a law approved by voters in 2010, if the union rejects the contract, the two sides go before an arbitrator who cannot rule against Muni management's proposals unless the union proves its interests outweigh "the public interest in efficient and reliable transit."
This takes away the chance for a back-and-forth between labor and management, Williams said Tuesday.
The sickout comes amid displeasure over the proposed labor agreement that was overwhelmingly rejected Friday by Muni operators.
In a statement Tuesday, Transport Workers Union Local 250-A officials said bus drivers, cable car operators and other transit workers had voted 1,198-47 against the proposed contract. Union leaders said that they had offered to return to the bargaining table but that Muni declined to do so.
The MTA board met for an hour Tuesday afternoon to discuss the work stoppage. Spokesman Paul Rose said afterward that 100 more drivers had shown up Tuesday than Monday, and the agency was "cautiously optimistic" of a further increase Wednesday, in part because of the requirement to present a doctor's note or go unpaid for the day.
But Rose said there were no signs that service was about to return to normal.
"We're encouraging our riders to include a bit more time in their commute to get to their destination," he said.
Peter Schweizer, author of Clinton Cash – the book turned documentary that made its debut on Breitbart – will be hosting an “Ask Me Anything” interview at Reddit's Donald Trump community /r/The_Donald. Anyone signed up to the site will be able to ask the author questions.
The AMA is set to take place tonight at 8PM EST. This provides Reddit users with a great opportunity to ask Mr. Schweizer questions about his book, that exposes much of the corruption surrounding the Clinton family.
For those who haven't used Reddit before, you can register a new account here, then simply follow this link to /r/The_Donald where you will be able to see Peter Schweizer's AMA thread at the top of the page, once it is posted this evening.
The documentary adaptation of Schweizer's Clinton Cash, which debuted here on Breitbart, surpassed 500'000 views in just 48 hours. On YouTube, Breitbart's official upload of the video has attracted 377,455 views so far, while a pirated upload of the film has attracted 437,133 views. That amounts to a total of 814,599 views across the two most successful YouTube uploads.
More than 283,000 Bernie Sanders supporters promoted the film across social media, catapulting it to the top of the Facebook Trending Topic list on Sunday.
Following the massive popularity of the film, Breitbart has decided to make the film free to watch forever, at this link.
/r/The_Donald's users have ardently supported Donald Trump in his presidential campaign since he first began running in the primary elections and have grown into a significantly large Reddit community boasting more than 184,100 subscribers.
The community, while actively working to support Trump and further his campaign, have also been vigilant in pointing out censorship of free speech on the Reddit platform. Following Bernie Sanders' endorsement of Hillary Clinton and further call for his supporters to vote for her despite DNC leaks proving that the party actively worked against him, /r/The_Donald users have welcomed former Sanders supporters with open arms and pushed for them to join the Trump community in an effort to stop Hillary Clinton.
This isn't the first time a well known name has made an appearance in /r/The_Donald and it won't be the last. The community is about to score its biggest name yet, with Donald Trump himself hosting an AMA interview on the website the day after Schweizer's appearance.

Popular Bitcoin and altcoin exchange Poloniex has submitted a request for no action relief to the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) around potential allegations that required timing of the “actual delivery” of cryptocurrency, regulated by a 28 day period in the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), has been violated.

The digital nature of cryptocurrency, however, does not mend well to the wording of existing laws, thereby hurting attempts to determine the full, or “actual” delivery of the commodity. Poloniex, in turn, has responded by saying that their business practices of providing cryptocurrency exchange and margin trading do not fall under this stipulation.
Poloniex Makes a Case for Constructive Bitcoin Regulation
Due to the unique, abstract nature of cryptocurrency, determining when an “actual delivery” occurred is grey in relation to the black and white delivery of traditional commodities such as wheat or oil.
The CEA, enacted initially in 1936, states, “physical… delivery [of] the entire quantity of the commodity purchased by the buyer, including any portion of the purchase made using leverage, margin, or financing.”
While the blockchain is time-stamped, delivery of cryptocurrency itself to customers is the main question in play here. Poloniex, however, argues that the cryptocurrency at hand is delivered to the recipient immediately after the completion of an order. Whether these transactions are traditional or for lending or margin trading, the recipient takes possession, ownership, and legal control of the cryptocurrency as soon as an order is completed.
While it seems that this would free such services from this particular regulatory obligation, such questions will have to be answered in court.
Speaking to the difficulty faced by many organizations navigating the murky regulatory waters in the space and the subsequent need for further clarification, Poloniex's press release states:
“This privilege isn't without its challenges, because we are operating in an emerging space against a backdrop of regulations honed and crafted for yesterday's technology — the bygone era of analogue trading. As stakeholders, stewards, and charter members of a nascent technology, it is our collective responsibility to respectfully request for laws that make sense for this new technology.”
Do you think Poloniex is right? Let us know in the comments below.

Former Bethlehem cop denied ARD in theft
Cheryl Ruth is charged with stealing $19,000 from property room.
Cheryl Ruth, who faces theft and receiving stolen property charges, was recommended for Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition by Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli after she made full restitution. But her application for the ARD program couldn't win the approval of Judge Emil Giordano.
A retired Bethlehem police sergeant accused of stealing more than $19,000 from the department's property room was denied entry into a first-offenders' program on Wednesday.
"Judge Giordano denied her ARD," said defense attorney Joshua Fulmer. Asked whether his client will now be going to trial, Fulmer said, "We'll address that with the district attorney's office."
Ruth, 47, of Moore Township was charged with taking cash seized by police from 2000 to 2007 while she worked as the property room's officer. She told investigators she used the money to gamble in Atlantic City, according to court records.
The rejection came as another former Bethlehem police officer facing a criminal charge withdrew his request to be placed into the same program. Under ARD, defendants avoid a conviction provided they complete a period of probation and pay court costs and fines. But the applications also require an acceptance of responsibility.
Michael Lenner, 29, of Bethlehem was fired from the police force last month in the wake of his arrest on a tampering with evidence charge. Lenner is appealing his termination in Northampton County Court, arguing it was excessive, and that he is innocent of the criminal allegation.
County prosecutors say Lenner destroyed a surveillance video of a March 2010 arrest that was being probed due to allegations of police brutality.
The officer who was being investigated for excessive force, John Nye, was eventually cleared by the district attorney's office. Like Lenner, Nye was also fired by Bethlehem City Council, and is challenging that decision in court.
In Lenner's appeal, defense attorney Philip Lauer wrote that his client "may have made untruthful or misleading statements" to internal investigators and "may have been guilty of conduct unbecoming of an officer for having done so."
"He was not, however, guilty of falsifying or altering evidence," Lauer argued.
Wednesday was the court's monthly day for processing defendants into ARD. Among those accepted was a Palmer Township woman accused of stealing more than $24,000 from a youth soccer league.
Sara E. Lemmerman, 34, is the former treasurer of Blue Mountain Youth Soccer League. Charged with taking money for seven months ending in May, Lemmerman was able to pay back all of the missing funds.
The league's president, Thomas Barrow of Bethlehem Township, has said the resolution is frustrating, especially given the "betrayal of trust." Morganelli says ARD allows the league to get its money back more quickly than if Lemmerman was tried and convicted.

A substitute teacher who allegedly compared a Grade 6 student to a "crackhead" no longer works with the Toronto District School Board, a spokesperson told CBC on Wednesday, but it's unclear if he could end up in front of a classroom again.
The development follows a reported incident at Norman Cook Public School late last month, when the teacher allegedly responded to a question about an English assignment with what Abigail Francis, the boy's mother, believes was nothing short of a racist remark.
The class had been assigned a poetry project called "All the places we love." When 11-year-old son Isaiah asked for clarification, the teacher allegedly responded, "It means like home sweet home. Or maybe for you, in a dark alleyway like a crackhead."
Francis told CBC Toronto earlier this month that one of Isaiah's classmates encouraged him to file a report.
'He wouldn't have said that to me because I'm white'
"If I had gone up and asked the same question, he wouldn't have said that to me because I'm white," the classmate told Isaiah, according to Francis.
Isaiah, his mother points out, is half-black, half-Indian and one of just three black students in his class.

(Supplied by Abigail Francis) The comment left Isaiah and other members of the class stunned, according to his mother, and prompted an investigation by the board in December. The teacher was put on "home assignment," meaning he would remain out of TDSB schools.
"If the allegation is founded, it is completely unacceptable and goes against the considerable work the TDSB is doing to combat racism, bias and oppression," spokesperson Ryan Bird said at the time.
The board, citing privacy reasons, wouldn't say if the teacher was dismissed or resigned.
Unclear if teacher faced discipline
Asked about the circumstances that led to the teacher no longer working at the board, Bird could not say.
The school board would also not comment on results of the internal investigation, any disciplinary action, whether the incident might be flagged to other boards that could potentially employ the teacher, or whether he could end up working for the TDSB again.
Francis said she has been in contact with the school's superintendent, who has called her every few days to update her on the investigation. But TDSB officials haven't yet confirmed whether the teacher's licence has been affected.
While the board's director and superintendent have apologized to Francis, Isaiah has yet to receive an apology from the teacher, his mother said.
Mother's concerns linger
Francis said she held off on filing a formal complaint with the Ontario College of Teachers because she wanted to see if the teacher would acknowledge the damage done by his alleged comment and apologize.
"I could work with that. I just don't want this happening to other children. This is a white male teacher talking to a child who is black," she said. "He attached a stereotype to him."
Francis said she's relieved the teacher won't be returning to her son's school, but maintains it's important that the board reveal the terms on which he left.
"I didn't want him allowed in any school if he couldn't acknowledge and own up to his violation and engage with Isaiah by apologizing directly to him," she said.
"I'm grateful he's no longer employed. He's not here, he's not able to affect other students" in Isaiah's class, she said.
"But can he move to other boards? Can he do this again?"
Imagine being surrounded by floating mammoth-sized lollipops in a riot of colors against a backdrop of a powder-blue New Mexico sky. Your eyes light up as the spectacle of colors and shapes bring out your inner-child!
What is a morning at the Albuqurque Balloon Fiesta Like?
Imagine being surrounded by floating mammoth-sized lollipops in a riot of colors against a backdrop of a powder-blue New Mexico sky. Your eyes light up as the spectacle of color and shape unfolds before you. No matter how old you may be, this is sure to bring out your inner-child. You are not dreaming!
This is the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta. You are standing with tens of thousands of spectators, tiny-as-ants, in a park the size of 54 football fields, watching the show of shows. It starts in the pre-sunrise darkness with the Dawn Patrol and finishes with a riotous flurry of colorful orbs ascending into powder blue skies just over your head. Welcome to the most photogenic event in the world!
From Humble Beginnings to International Fame
The Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta began in 1972 at the Coronado Shopping Mall with only 13 balloons who participated in a balloon chase. One hot-air balloon would ascend, and the others would chase it. By the year 2000, the Fiesta was hosting 750 balloons with hundreds more seeking to participate.
The focus of the Balloon Fiesta shifted from being a championship balloon race to a fun event where a mass ascension of hundreds of colorful balloons delights spectators who share the field. With the addition of live music events and hundreds of vendors, it has taken on a colorful carnival-like atmosphere.
The Albuquerque Box
Balloon Fiesta Park, the permanent home of the Fiesta, fills every autumn with more than 100,000 spectators taking advantage of the ‘holy grail' of balloon-riding weather known as the “Albuquerque Box.” These are wind conditions that are ideal for ballooning in Albuquerque. The “box” is a set of very predictable wind patterns that can be used to navigate the balloons — at low elevations, the winds tend to be southerly (from the south), but at higher elevations, they tend to be northerly. The effect is that the balloons can literally be flown in a wide arching circle around Balloon Fiesta Park, keeping them in view of the spectators. It is also ideal for the balloon races and competitions that are held as part of the event.
Balloonists use these winds to navigate in a vertical box — allowing the balloon to take off and land in almost exactly the same spot. Balloon pilots do not have a way to steer their hot air balloons. While they can control where the balloon flies vertically (by heating the air in the balloon to go higher), they rely on the wind to determine their direction.
Be There Early to Catch All the Fun!
Early October mornings before sunrise can be chilly in Albuquerque. Wear a couple of removable layers to keep warm until the sun rises. Be sure to have an early wake-up call to catch the start of the Fiesta day. At 5:45 am, the day begins with Dawn Patrol. Dozens of pre-dawn balloons light up the night air as they start the day's events. This is a great time to grab a tasty breakfast burrito and coffee from one of the many food vendors lining the balloon field. Dawn Patrol also has a practical purpose, allowing event coordinators to predict wind speeds and direction for the remainder of the day. After Dawn Patrol, things start to heat up and move quickly.
Traffic-Controlling Zebras and Glowing Balloons
At about 7:15 am, the main event begins. Mass Ascension is a coordinated launching of all the hot-air balloons that continues to approximately 9:00 am. This is the big show! You can walk all across the field to cheer on the launch crews. Be sure to bring your camera. You are not just a spectator, you are a part of the celebration!
During mass ascensions, balloons launch in two well-coordinated waves. Launch directors, also known as “Zebras” because of their black-and-white-striped outfits, serve as traffic controllers, coordinating the launch so balloons leave the field in a safe and organized manner. Weather permitting, balloons begin to launch promptly about 7:15 am on all mass ascension days. Thursdays and Fridays feature the Special Shapes Rodeo when balloons shaped like cartoon characters, animals, and other creative shapes take center stage. In every direction you look, the field is covered with balloons in various stages of inflation and flight.
The time seems to fly by as the Morning session comes to an end at about 9:00 am. At that point, all of the balloons have launched. You will see a number of balloons enjoying the “Albuquerque Box” and others return for landing. Now is a great time to explore Albuquerque and check out some of its legendary restaurants for a late breakfast!
The Evening Sessions at the Balloon Fiesta
If you yearn for more excitement, you will want to return to Balloon Fiesta Park in time for the Balloon Glow and AfterGlow fireworks events that start at around 5:45 pm. During Balloon Glow, all of the balloons fire their propane burners and light up at the same time. It is a dramatic display set against the last light of the sunset sky. The AfterGlow fireworks end the event at 8:00 pm with a dazzling display of light and sound. Awesome!
Be a Part of the Show!
You can walk right up to hot air balloons as they are prepared for flight by enthusiastic crews. If you want to get closer still, share in a balloon ride! Rainbow Ryders, the Balloon Fiesta's official balloon riding service, offers hot-air balloon rides to visitors as part of the event. However, reservations are limited and must be made well in advance.
The Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta is a dazzling show is not to be missed. Indeed, the entire city of Albuquerque shares in the festivities. Be sure to attend! It will be an unforgettable event.

Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The gloves came off in the second prime ministerial debate as Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg clashed over global affairs. In fiery exchanges, the three leaders locked horns on Europe, climate change, tax, nuclear weapons and sleaze. Mr Brown and Mr Cameron agreed less with Mr Clegg than last week and instead stressed policy differences. BBC Political Editor Nick Robinson said all three performed well and it proved "we are in a tight three horse race". Opinion polls taken immediately after the debate gave conflicting verdicts over whether Mr Cameron or Mr Clegg came out on top but they agreed that the margins between all three contenders were much tighter than in the first debate. But BBC polling expert David Cowling said there had been a significant drop in the number of people who thought Mr Clegg won, with Mr Brown having the most improved ratings. The debate itself was livelier than last week, with flashes of anger from Mr Cameron in particular as he accused Labour of spreading "lies" about Tory policy on benefits for the elderly in election leaflets, telling Mr Brown he should be "ashamed" of them. 'Desperate' At several points, both Mr Cameron and Mr Brown attempted to take a leaf out of Nick Clegg's book by pointing to the squabbling of the other two. But they avoided saying "I agree with Nick" in an effort to win the Lib Dem leader over and at one point Mr Cameron even said "I agree with Gordon" over nuclear weapons. Mr Brown made a point of attacking Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg equally, rounding off his closing statement by telling his two rivals: "Nick you would leave us weak, David you would leave us isolated in Europe." I think it's quite an insult that we were not represented in that debate

Analysis: 'Game on' in campaign In quotes: Reaction to debate Pundits make their judgements Nick Robinson: What a difference But the Labour leader's main pitch was to tell voters anything other than a Labour majority risked damaging the economy, telling voters: "Don't do anything that puts this economic recovery at risk." Mr Cameron said Mr Brown sounded "desperate" and accused him of "trying to frighten people". In his closing statement, he said Britain needed a "clean break from 13 years of failure". Mr Clegg, who was the last to deliver a closing statement, sought to strike an optimistic note, saying "people are beginning to hope that we can do something different this time" and "if we do things differently we can be a force for good in the world". The three leaders began by calling each other by their first names, but as the debate developed Mr Clegg in particular started calling his rivals by their full names when he addressed them. 'Hypocritical' Mr Clegg said he believed it was time for a "fundamental debate" on Europe and said "of course there are daft rules, of course it does daft things but it seems to me that we punch above our weight when you stand together in Europe". Mr Brown said he was determined to work with the "sensible" people in Europe, and accused Mr Cameron of aligning himself with "right-wing extremists" after pulling his MEPs out of the main centre-right European People's Party grouping. But the Tory leader said it would have been "hypocritical" to stay in the EPP. HAVE YOUR SAY Thought Labour and Conservative were better prepared tonight, although the complete turnaround from 'I agree with Nick' to 'get real' was interesting, to say the least! Pippa Mr Clegg weighed in by accusing Mr Cameron of working with "nutters, anti-Semites, people who deny climate change exists, homophobes". Mr Brown accused his two rivals of behaving like "my two boys at bath time - they are squabbling," gaining him the first laugh of the evening. He went on: "I am afraid David is anti-European, Nick is anti- American. Both of them are out of touch with reality." Mr Cameron hit back: "What you are hearing from the other two is, frankly, do not trust the people. Do not ask them when you pass powers from Westminster to Brussels. "Just give in to everything that comes out of Brussels and do not stand up for your country." Mr Clegg came under attack from his two rivals over his proposal to include Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent in the strategic defence review which all three parties have promised to hold after the election. The Lib Dem leader cited a group of retired generals who have warned that replacing Trident could take money away from frontline troops and that US President Barack Obama had identified the threats of the future as terrorism and failed states. But Mr Brown told him: "I have to deal with these issues every day and I say to you, Nick, get real." Mr Cameron agreed with the Labour leader, arguing "we are safer having an independent nuclear deterrent in an unsafe world ... a proper replacement for Trident." There was also lively debate over immigration policy, with Mr Clegg denying he wanted an "amnesty" for illegal immigrants and facing claims from Mr Cameron that his plan for regional targets did not make sense. Mr Cameron faced a similar claim from Mr Brown about his plan for an annual cap on immigration. Turning to the war in Afghanistan, Mr Clegg said the government had not pursued the right strategy or given the right equipment to British troops. Mr Brown said British troops were in Afghanistan because there was a "chain of terror" linking al-Qaeda groups across the world to action which could happen in the UK. Hung Parliament The leaders also clashed over cleaning-up politics, with Mr Brown saying he was "ashamed" of the way MPs had behaved and Mr Cameron said no party should put itself on a pedestal over expenses. But the Tory leader insisted there should not be voting reform to get rid of the first-past-the-post system. "Don't let us give up the way you can sack your government and throw them out, let us not have permanent hung Parliaments." Mr Clegg urged young people to register to vote, saying they could make it the "most exciting election in a very long time". Asked about the Daily Telegraph's allegations during the televised leaders' debate, Mr Clegg said: "It's a complete nonsense story... complete rubbish." The leaders were also quizzed about what they would do in the event of a hung Parliament, with Mr Clegg urging voters to ignore "ludicrous scare stories" about meltdown in the financial markets. Anti-war protesters were involved in a stand-off with police outside the venue in Bristol which hosted the debate. Six people were arrested for public order offences. A number of opinion polls placed the Lib Dems ahead of Labour and gaining on the Conservatives after last week's prime ministerial TV debate. Others, such as the YouGov/Sun survey of 20 April, have even put the Lib Dems in first place. Where's the change when the three Westminster leaders tonight, Cameron, Brown and Clegg, were as one in their support for continuing a war in Afghanistan
Adam Price, Plaid Cymru
dot.Rory: how it unfolded online Debate uncertainty over world role It has increased speculation that the general election on 6 May will result in a hung parliament - polls suggest the Conservatives are still slightly ahead but would not have enough seats to get an overall majority. Thursday's debate was held at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol, hosted by Sky's political editor Adam Boulton. Ahead of the debate the BBC Trust rejected a joint appeal from the Scottish and Welsh nationalist parties against the BBC's decision to exclude them from the prime ministerial debates - separate leaders' debates are being held in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Plaid Cymru's Adam Price branded the prime ministerial debate a "farce", saying: "Where's the choice? Where's the change when the three Westminster leaders tonight, Cameron, Brown and Clegg, were as one in their support for continuing a war in Afghanistan - a war with no end in sight and which has cost us dearly in lives and in funds?" Angus Robertson, for the SNP, said: "If people in Scotland want to avoid the exclusion of Scottish interest which we saw on display again tonight, the only mention of Scotland came once when the prime minister talked about the weather, that is simply not good enough." UK Independence Party MEP Nigel Farage, said there had not been a "proper debate about the European Union in this election campaign." Mr Farage, who campaigns for Britain to leave the EU, said: "Was that it? A ten-minute debate in the entire general election campaign about the institution that now makes 75% of our laws. And what we saw was total agreement that we must be part of the European Union." Green Party deputy leader Adrian Ramsay said the debate showed the three main parties were "not taking climate change seriously." Simon Darby, of the British National Party, also complained about the lack of debate on the EU: "There wasn't anybody there suggesting we should remove ourselves from the European Union. On the question on the war in Afghanistan, they are all in favour of the war in Afghanistan. We shouldn't be there." The English Democrats, who campaign for an English Parliament, said the debate was a "no score" draw for England: "Roll on a hung parliament with representatives from the English Democrats to stand up for England, like the SNP stand up for Scotland."

The Rolling Stones have probably released more iconic tracks than any other band in history. Hardly surprising when you learn they've been together for over half a century and hold the record for the most recorded songs of all time. One of the most iconic of their incredible 439 tracks is “Paint It, Black”. Released in 1966, it was the first single from the fourth album, Aftemath, and became an anthem for the Sixties counter culture.
What's more, it's one of our favourite tunes ever. Two very good reasons to dig deeper and discover more about a song, music critic Richie Unterberger said, “qualifies as perhaps the most effective use of a sitar in a rock song.”
1. The original version was entitled “Paint It Black” without a comma. Keith Richards later said that the comma was added by the record label, Decca.
2.There was no specific inspiration for the lyrics. When asked at the time why he wrote a song about death and depression Mick Jagger replied: “I don't know. It's been done before. It's not an original thought by any means. It all depends on how you do it.”
3. In 1966, the single topped both the United States and the United Kingdom charts, making it the first ever US and UK number one single to feature a sitar. Nearly forty years later, in 2004, it was ranked number 176 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.
4. Jagger got the line “I turn my head until my darkness goes” from James Joyce's Ulysses.
5. Talking on his Absolute Radio show, Stones' co-guitarist Ronnie Wood disclosed that Keith Richards has trouble remembering how to play this song. He revealed, “We always have this moment of hesitation where we don't know if Keith's going to get the intro right.”
6. In the late 1980s, “Paint It Black” became associated with the Vietnam War due to its use in both the ending credits of the 1987 film Full Metal Jacket and its use as the theme song for Tour Of Duty, a CBS-TV show about the Vietnam war which ran from 1987-1990.
7. Sadly, for The Rolling Stones, “Paint It, Black” is one of the tunes they no longer control. They sold the rights to it during the Sixties to ex-manager Allen Klein.

CHICAGO – After 100 days on the job, new Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is touting his administration's first accomplishments. The impression is one of boldly charting a new course of change.
The accomplishments touted include transferring more police onto the beat, cutting some financial waste, greater transparency, implementing dedicated bike lanes, encouraging the creation of 4,000 private sector jobs, greater use of the social media to communicate with the public, etc.
To be sure, after 24 years of Mayor Richard M. Daley, some big changes were in order. And Emanuel is inheriting huge problems, including a projected $635 million city budget deficit and a $700 million Chicago Public Schools budget deficit. City unemployment stands at 9.9 percent overall and over 20 percent in the African American community and higher among youth.
But is the new administration really much of a change from Daley? A close look reveals more change in style than substance.
Like the Daley administration, the Emanuel policies represent powerful financial and big business interests and global transnational capital. Among the new accomplishments are many commissions and task forces stocked full of business and finance leaders.
To deal with the city financial crises Emanuel has insisted on “shared sacrifices” so everyone “has skin in the game.” But the sacrifices have all been one sided.
Two of Emanuel's first big fights have been with organized labor. Emanuel threw down the gauntlet by dictating terms in the public media and bullying public workers, while trying to pit them against city residents.
First, Emanuel pledged to make $75 million in cuts to close a current year budget deficit. Emanuel threatened to lay off 625 city workers unless they agreed to rule changes to save the city $50 million.
The Chicago Federation of Labor leadership subsequently released a report, which contains thoughtful proposals that would instead save the city $242 million.
So far the administration has turned a deaf ear and some observers wonder if the bullying is an effort to intimidate labor and turn city residents against public workers instead of demanding sacrifices from big business. Needless to say, relations with the labor movement have been strained.
Emanuel and new school department CEO Jean-Claude Brizard are also bullying teachers in public. To deal with the Chicago Public Schools budget deficit, the School Board cancelled a 4 percent pay raise that city teachers had coming according to their contract.
The move was part of a larger plan passed, which included a $150 million property tax hike, a $200 million spending cut and tapping $250 million from a reserve fund. It will result in 500 staff layoffs.
Emanuel and Brizard have announced a longer school day and year, which will begin September 2012, despite teacher opposition. A task force has been established to determine how to implement the idea.
Chicago Public Schools “has loaded its advisory council with charter school proponents, parochial school leaders, administration-connected clergy, politicians and union-busting advocacy groups,” Chicago Teachers Union spokesperson Stephanie Gadlin told CBS. “This news has nothing do with helping our children and everything to do with politicizing a real serious problem. Our children deserve better.”
Needless to say, teachers' union President Karen Lewis declined to participate.
But extending the school day would not include hiring extra staff nor do any of the reforms being discussed include reducing class size, which most education experts agree is the most effective way to improve education, and adding extra classroom personnel.
Emanuel has also said little of the Tax Increment Financing Accounts that have been siphoning $500 million a year from city school and parks and used as a mayoral slush fund for economic development. Millions have been invested in downtown development and subsidizing big businesses rather than in community development and schools.
A task force of business leaders has been set up to suggest reforms.
It appears Emanuel will also continue forging ahead on privatization of public services and assets. One indicator is the hiring of Lois Scott as the city's CFO. Scott was formerly president of the financial advisory firm Scott Balice Strategies, specializing in government privatization deals.
Since taking office Emanuel has been silent on the parking meter debacle and the possibility of renegotiating or cancelling the deal, which was a blatant give-a-way to global capital corporations.
Emanuel decided to implement a privatization deal agreed to by the Daley administration to turn over the city's recycling program to the transnational giant Waste Management. This is being done under cover of establishing a competition between the private and public sector. In fact, this is a deal that was already made.
And Emanuel favors expanding the number of charter schools, the main form of school privatization. Some of the largest investors, like Bill Gates, the Walton Foundation and hedge funds like the Stearns Family Foundation in Illinois, support the charter school movement. Charters are seen as a way to reduce and eliminate teachers' unions and any regulations governing wages, benefits and the workday.
Mayor Emanuel may have a new style, but it masks the same political substance of his predecessor. Only a bigger labor led people's movement can successfully resist the pro-big business policies of the new administration.
EXCLUSIVE: Frederik Pohl's Gateway may finally get a screen adaptation. Entertainment One Television (Hell On Wheels) has teamed with De Laurentiis Co. (Hannibal) to develop and produce a drama series adaptation of Pohl's sci-fi classic. The two companies landed the rights to the 1977 book in a competitive situation, with a number of producers pursuing. The project will be executive produced by De Laurentiis Co's Martha De Laurentiis and Lorenzo De Maio along with eOne's John Morayniss, CEO eOne TV; Michael Rosenberg, EVP U.S. Scripted TV; and Benedict Carver, SVP Filmed Entertainment. Search is underway for a writer to write the adaptation, with a number of established showrunners already interested because of Gateway‘s cult status. eOne TV will handle worldwide distribution. De Laurentiis Co., which has a history in screen adaptations of sci-fi classics — most notably the 1984 feature Dune — had been tracking Gateway for years as the book had gone through a number of incarnations, including being developed as a feature. When rights recently became available, De Laurentiis and De Maio went aggressively after it, partnering with eOne, a company they had been looking to collaborate with for the past three years. From the get go, the duo knew they wanted to do the adaptation as a series, not a feature. “Television gives us the opportunity of exploring the rich world of the novel and the complexity of its characters,” De Laurentiis said. Gateway actually started in a serialized format, running in sci-fi magazine Galaxy before its hardcover publication.
Gateway is set on a space station constructed by a long-vanished alien race that now is inhabited by humans. It centers on Robinette “Rob” Broadhead, who, haunted by a dark love story, has traveled on a one-way ticket from Earth for the extremely dangerous mission of piloting one of thousands of abandoned alien spacecrafts on Gateway. The technology of these alien ships is not fully understood, with most trips resulting in death. The reward for a rare successful return, however, can be untold riches, so crews continue to sign up despite the desperate odds. “It is an absolute, complete, desperate gamble with very high stakes that attracts all those desperate people to a border town,” said De Maio, who noted how contemporary Gateway feels despite being written four decades ago as it tackles such concepts as mining asteroids.
Gateway has won a Hugo Award, a Nebula Award, a Locus Award and a John W. Campbell Memorial Award. Pohl, who died last fall at age 93, wrote more than 40 novels and was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 1998. Gateway and the Pohl estate are repped by Holly Frederick at Curtis Brown.

Quick Play mode, a similar mode to "Marathon Mode" from DDR X2 in which PASELI users can use the pay-per-song method for as many stages as the arcade allows. For some time, this mode is also the only way to access the Challenge charts of some songs. [2]
Target Score, which allows players to view machine and e-Amusement records without playing the song. [3]
"BEMANI Title" sort, which allows songs to be sorted by the BEMANI title they originally appeared in. [3]
DRILL COURSE have been removed.
There are some arcade machines of DDR X3 in which judgment of streaked notes and the quantity of combos are placed under the note strip while others are placed on top of the note strip.

DDR X3 will also support "e-AMUSEMENT GATE", a community website where players can form groups, share scores, and interact with other players.
Enjoy Level Edit
As in previous games, DDR X3 vs 2ndMix uses level unlocking system to unlock some of the game's unlockable content. Players need to fulfill certain requirements to fill up the "Enjoy Level" bar and when it is full, the player levels up. This requires e-Amusement. Most of Enjoy Level unlocks are songs taken from North American DDR 2010 and DDR II, in addition to new songs.
Extra Stage Edit
DDR X3 also implements a new system for accessing Extra Stage. "Star system" can now be used to access Extra Stage. When the player clear a song, they will get stars (shown below the grade) depending on what grade they get:
AAA grade = 3 stars
AA grade = 2 stars
A-D grade = 1 star
Song or course failed (E) = 0 stars
Getting a full combo = Additional 1 star (Except AAA and E)
A slot with 9-star slots will be displayed below the results screen. When the player earn 9 stars, they can access Extra Stage regardless of their grade. After using it though, they will reset and the player must earn them back. Note that this is only available for players with e-AMUSEMENT. The new song available for Extra Stage is Amalgamation. In addition, the Encore Extra Stage songs are eventually available on Extra Stage after a specified date and if the player fulfill a secret requirement using the star system, with UNBELIEVABLE (Sparky remix) being available on January 25, 2012, NEPHILIM DELTA on April 25, 2012, and as of July 23, 2012, all Extra Stage songs have been unlocked for regular play.
Encore Extra Stage Edit
The requirement for accessing Encore Extra Stage is the same from DDR X2; scoring AA or better under Expert on the specific song during Extra Stage. Scoring AA or better on Amalgamation will unlock UNBELIEVABLE (Sparky remix). Two additional songs were added on Encore Extra Stage after a specified date: NEPHILIM DELTA on January 25, 2012 and SILVER☆DREAM on April 25, 2012. All Encore Extra Stage songs have been unlocked as of July 23, 2012.
Extra Tour Edit
A new Extra Stage event, called "EXTRA Tour" was announced on May 12, 2012 and was started on May 14, 2012. In this event, new songs will be added as Extra Stage. They will appear in specific regions at first and move to other regions each day. The first song, tokyoEVOLVED will appear in Hokkaido and Okinawa Prefecture and move to the south (for Hokkaido) and north (for Okinawa) until they eventually land on each other's region.[4] There is also a second route, starting on May 16, 2012 from Mie Prefecture and Fukui Prefecture.

Crossover DDR Edit
On August 2, 2012, a new event called "Crossover DDR" was started. In this event, players can unlock the 2ndMix-exclusive songs for use in X3 mode. Players will simply need to play the charts of the songs in 2ndMix mode to unlock them in X3 mode. As 2ndMix Mode only feature Basic, Difficult, and Expert charts for Single (or only Basic and Difficult in Double), the Beginner chart will be automatically unlocked once the player unlock at least one of the main difficulties, while the Double Expert as well as Single and Double Challenge charts (which all songs have) will unlock once the player unlocks all other charts.
Three boss songs also can be unlocked through this event. Clearing all charts in Normal mode of the 2ndMix mode will unlock "TRIP MACHINE EVOLUTION" in Extra Stage, while clearing all charts in Hard mode will unlock "PARANOiA Revolution". Scoring AA or better on these songs on Expert unlock the Encore Extra Stage, LOVE IS THE POWER Re:born.

The event was ended on November 5, 2012 and all songs were unlocked for regular play, with no video for LOVE IS THE POWER Re:born.
Internet Ranking Edit
The game will have Internet Ranking like previous games. As usual, it uses the courses available in the game. The game uses e-Amusement to upload the scores to network. There are five Internet Rankings :
INTERNET RANKING#1 = February 8, 2012 - February 22, 2012 ~ uses HYPER and vs X3

NT Attorney-General John Elferink involved in two punch-ups in 24 hours
Updated
The NT Attorney-General has been punched in the face while trying to stop an argument at a Darwin football oval, police say, hours after he intervened when a woman was allegedly assaulted across town.
John Elferink, a former policeman, was at soccer training with his children at Gardens Oval on Tuesday evening when he noticed two adults arguing and intervened.
"The Attorney-General went over to intervene and was punched in the face by the ... man," Police Duty Superintendent Craig Ryan said.
"[Mr Elferink] apprehended the man and held him on the ground until the police arrived."
I would rather suffer the consequences of a fat lip or black eye than a lifetime full of shame if I didn't step in and some real injury had resulted. NT Attorney-General John Elferink
Speaking about the incident today, Mr Elferink said he saw a fight break out between people who were drinking.
"A lady stepped in between and got a smack in the mouth," Mr Elferink said.
"I intervened. This gentleman remained belligerent... and I was able to restrain him until he was taken into the custody."
A 25-year-old man was arrested over the incident.
Elferink involved in second punch-up
Earlier, Mr Elferink had stepped in during an incident in Smith Street Mall, restraining a man after seeing him hit a woman in the face.
"They had an exchange of words which I kept a close eye on," Mr Elferink said.
"Then I watched the gentleman turn around and give the lady a smack in the mouth.
"I don't tolerate that, I abhor violence.
"I stepped in by grabbing him by the lapels of his tracksuit and encouraging him to walk the other way.
"I turned around to see the state of the female, but she had scarpered by that stage.
"We'll chalk that one up to experience."
ABC employee Richard Clarke, who saw the incident, later explained that Mr Elferink looked restrained as he held the man.
"He had his arm pushed into the gentleman in question and was just holding him back with his other hand," Mr Clarke said.
Mr Elferink said he did not recommend people automatically interfere during violent situations.
"I use my judgement, I don't encourage it for everyone," he said.
"I would rather suffer the consequences of a fat lip or black eye than a lifetime full of shame if I didn't step in and some real injury had resulted."
It is not the first time the Mr Elferink has encountered, and promptly dealt with, a physical threat.
In 2012, he was kicked from behind while holding a media conference about violence and rushed to arrest the culprit.
An Irish backpacker, who kicked the Attorney-General to win a bet, was later fined $2,200 for aggravated assault and escaping lawful custody.

Meet Stephen Miller, the former aide to Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions who routinely warms up crowds with fiery speeches before Trump rallies.
His role on Donald Trump's presidential campaign is unorthodox: not only does he get the crowd going before the presumptive Republican nominee speaks, but he is also the candidate's senior policy adviser.
“Don't ever, ever let anybody tell you that you're not a good person because you want to secure the border,” Miller told a Trump rally in Dallas on Thursday. “You are a patriot because you want to secure the border. You are somebody acting out of love — love for your fellow man and your country and your community when you want to secure the border.”
Miller's speech on Thursday has been getting buzz online from Trump supporters.
Watch it here:
Read a transcript of Miller's speech:
We are in the fight of our lives, folks. Did you ever really think, did you ever think the special interests would give up control easily? Did you ever think they wouldn't scratch and claw and fight with their last ounce of strength to maintain their fever grip on this country? Did you ever think the politicians who betrayed you, the donors who sold you out, the special interests who didn't care about your family, did you ever think they would just hand the keys of power over without a fight?
You knew that this moment would come where you would have to stand tall and stand strong and stand together to take back this country. And you knew it wasn't going to be easy, and you knew you would have to dig down deep inside to find that extra measure of strength and devotion and courage so that your children can grow up in a country where they can say my needs come first in my own country, where they can say my job comes first in my own country, where they can say my security, my safety, my peace comes first to my own country. That's not a radical idea. That's the most mainstream common-sense idea that you could ever possibly have.
When did we forget, when did we forget that a country exists to serve its own citizens? When did we forget the reason why we have a nation is to protect each other and care for each other and watch out for each other? That's why a country exists. That's why America exists, so you and your friends and your neighbors can reach out for your dreams. And you can do so not having to worry about terrorism. Not having to worry about crime. Not have to worry about a budget deficit that's gone out of control. Not having to worry about refugee programs we can't afford and children we can't educate and hospitals that are stretched beyond the breaking point.
We have a country so that all of us together can take care of each other and dream bigger and love our children and protect our future. That's why we have a country. When did we forget that, folks?
That's that's what this campaign is all about. This campaign is all about restoring the idea that a country exists to serve its own people. It doesn't exist to serve Hillary Clinton's Wall Street donors. It doesn't exist to line the pockets of Bill and Hillary Clinton. A country doesn't exist to help Bill and Hillary offshore jobs with terrible trade deal so they can get a little bit richer. A country doesn't exist for the personal benefit of Hillary Clinton.
A country exists for you. A country exists for the people of this country who go to work every day, who follow our rules, who fight our wars, who love their country and love each other and who make this a great nation. A country is all about its people. The people are the heart of a country. The people are the soul of a country. It's not the donors.
The pulse, the heartbeat, the essence of a country is you. It's all of you. And you've all been forgotten. And the evidence is all around us. Our hearts broke as a nation last summer when Kate Steinle was murdered in cold blood, and yet we saw the people who ran this country couldn't be roused to action by that horrible tragedy.
The sight of Kate Steinle dead was not enough to bring our political class to action on behalf of the American people. How many children are dead because of our sanctuary cities? How many moms are grieving because of our sanctuary cities? How many American lives, how many American families, were broken apart and separated because our politicians only care about lining their own pockets?
Don't ever, ever let anybody tell you that you're not a good person because you want to secure the border. You are a patriot because you want to secure the border. You are somebody acting out of love — love for your fellow man and your country and your community when you want to secure the border.
The people who are heartless, the people who are shameless, the people who should be apologizing every day and asking for forgiveness are the people who left that border open, knowing the toll is put on our communities. The overdoses from the drugs, from the gangs, the cartels. They need to be apologizing to you and begging you for your forgiveness because they have betrayed your interest as American citizens.
But I have some good news for you. I have some fabulous news for you, folks. And I'm excited to get the chance to deliver it.
After years of betrayal, history has given us a chance to take back the country for the people. History has given us the chance to tell the special interests that they don't write the rules anymore. History has given us the chance to tell the politicians who betrayed you that they're not going to be calling the shots anymore. History has given us the chance to put a man in the White House who answers only to you and you alone.
Folks, that is a wonderful and blessed thing. That's an opportunity many of us never thought would come.
I think a lot of us, let's be honest, we were starting to lose hope, weren't we? We were starting to think that day would never arrive. And then something magical happened and we saw it unfold this whole primary season beginning one year ago today. We saw a man stand up and stand tall. And when the special interests came after him, when they bullied him, when they told him to back down, when they told the change his tone, when they told him to stop fighting for you, you know what he said? “I'm never backing down. I am never stopping this fight. I am never going to stop representing the people of this country.”
Donald J. Trump, unlike Hillary Clinton, he cares about you. Donald J. Trump, unlike Hillary Clinton, is going to fight for you. Donald J. Trump, like Hillary Clinton, he can't be bought. He can't be purchased. He can't be owned. His only special interest is the American people for whom he will always be loyal. He will be your fiercest champion.
And when you need help, when you need his support, he will never say, “No, a donor told me I can't do this.” He'll never say, “No, the media told me I can't do this.” He'll never say, “No, the bankers, the Wall Street financiers, the global special interests told me I can't do this.” He'll say, “If it's right for America, I'm going to do it and I will never apologize.”
And folks, in a few minutes you're going to hear from him. So I want you to shout so loud that they can hear you in Washington, D.C. I want you to shout so loud, I want to shout so loud that it shakes the boots of all the special interests. Are you ready? Are you ready to send to Washington a man who will put Americans first, last and always? Are you ready to elect Donald J. Trump and are you ready to put the American people first again?
God, bless the state of Texas. God, bless all of you. And God, bless this country. Thank you.
Six Reasons Why Foundations Should Invest in Worker Cooperatives
If you're a coffee lover, you've likely enjoyed beans cultivated by farmers from a fair trade worker cooperative. If you haven't yet, sip a delicious brew of fair trade coffee in the spirit of this past Saturday's World Fair Trade Day, which celebrates fair trade as a “tangible contribution to the fight against poverty and exploitation, climate change and the economic crisis that has the greatest impact on the world's most vulnerable populations.”
When fair trade comes to my mind, instead of coffee and other ethically-sourced products, the first thing I associate it with is worker cooperatives – defined by the U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives as “business entities that are owned and controlled by their members.” Whether rural or urban, philanthropy can look to worker cooperatives as a way to reduce poverty and inequality, empower workers and anchor jobs and wealth in a community.
Here are six reasons why foundations need to consider investing in worker cooperatives as a way to ensure that their grantmaking and investment dollars benefit underserved communities:
1. Worker cooperatives help build resilient local communities. The Democracy at Work Institute writes that worker cooperatives are “an effective tool for creating and maintaining sustainable, dignified jobs; generating wealth; improving the quality of life of workers; and promoting community and local economic development, particularly for people who lack access to business ownership or even sustainable work options.” With the cooperative model, women, immigrants, economically disadvantaged and historically marginalized racial communities have the potential to overcome barriers that limit their economic opportunities. In March, Truthout reported on the benefits of worker cooperatives for low-income women.
2. Cooperatives are found in practically every industry. The Democracy at Work Institute recently conducted an analysis of the field and found cooperatives in nearly every sector of the economy, concentrated in manufacturing, retail, food, administration/waste management and professional services. This past week Grist reported on the growth of agriculture cooperatives in the U.S., including well-known companies such as Ocean Spray, Organic Valley and Sunkist. As a local example, Takoma Park, MD is home to a food co-op and a cooperative nursery school. There are likely democratically-run businesses in your community, including credit unions!
3. There is potential to scale. Last year, the Democracy Collaborative – whose executive director, Ted Howard, helped launch the Evergreen Cooperatives and the Metropolitan Washington Community Wealth Building Initiative – released Worker Cooperatives: Pathways to Scale. The report shares how allies such as foundations can help grow worker-owned business in the U.S. by catalyzing more investment to build infrastructure and capacity, developing a friendlier ecosystem for cooperatives and increasing available capital through grants, loans and equity.
4. Investment in worker cooperatives amplifies impact beyond grantmaking. Foundations make mission (or impact) investments to achieve their philanthropic goals and generate both a social and a financial return. Mission Investors Exchange writes that “foundations of all types and sizes make mission investments in order to make capital more available to initiatives and enterprises that will create positive benefits for the communities they serve.” A worker cooperative is a clear example of an impactful investment that enables local workers to access the wealth they create.
5. Cities are already doing this work. Last summer, New York City allotted $1.2 million for the development of worker-owned cooperative businesses in 2015. Inspired by New York City, the city of Madison, Wisconsin will invest $5 million in worker cooperatives over the next five years. Foundations can partner with cities and local governments to provide funding, resources and policy advocacy.
6. Foundations are already doing this work. Most notably, the Cleveland Foundation, an NCRP Philanthropy's Promise signatory, partnered with local grantmakers, banks and the municipal government to seed a revolving loan fund for Evergreen Cooperatives, a coordinated network of employee-owned enterprises that launched in 2008. Evergreen Cooperatives has been so successful that it is now referred to as the Cleveland Model. The Surdna Foundation, through its Strong Local Economies program, supports alternative business models such as employee-owned cooperatives to benefit “communities that have been most impacted by inequitable economic policy,” such as people of color, women and immigrants. In addition, in 2011 the Washington Regional Association of Grantmakers convened local foundations and supported a feasibility study for an initiative similar to the Cleveland Model. They were instrumental in founding the Metropolitan Washington Community Wealth Building Initiative, which incorporated its first worker-owned business last year.
The Washington Regional Association of Grantmakers will be holding a briefing about the impact and vision of the Community Wealth Building Initiative on May 18 – register here to learn more. While you're at it, sign up for a webinar on May 20 to learn more about the Next System Project and join a broader conversation on new economic institutions and approaches for systemic change.
Foundations can bring new resources, expertise and business opportunities to this burgeoning field. What are other success stories and reasons to support worker cooperatives? How does your foundation leverage its philanthropic capital?

Ever signed up for one of TheStreet.com's investor services? Then you've probably also received an occasional email like the one below.
It's a personal note from "Jim Cramer." And it uses the oldest sleazy investment marketing tactic in the book.
What's that?
Cherry-picking.
In an attempt to get you drooling about how much money you'll make if you pony up and buy a subscription, the letter describes a few amazing calls Jim has made in recent months. Goldman Sachs! Nike! GE! What the letter doesn't do, of course, is described all of Jim's terrible calls.
This is what many newsletters (and investment managers) do: Tout their good calls and ignore their bad ones. And they do it because it works. But for anyone who takes their advice and clients seriously--as Cramer purports to--it's misleading and sleazy.
If you make 100 calls over the next month, about 50 of them will be good. If we wrote up the top 3 of them, we could make you sound like a market-wizard, too. And then you would be ready to start selling newsletters!
This, by the way, is what critics of the now-bankrupt-TheStreet.com-investment pro Lenny Dykstra said he used to do when marketing his own newsletter. He would close and exit the profitable trades and calculate his "returns" based on those. Meanwhile, he would just let the losers run. (Maybe that's what Cramer meant when he described Dykstra as "one of the great ones" in the business. Maybe he was referring to the newsletter-marketing business).
As we've said before, we think Cramer is a brilliant entertainer. We also have a lot of respect for his work ethic and breadth of experience and expertise.
But the pitch below isn't entertainment. It's marketing. And it's sleazy marketing at that.
Cramer always says his first priority is to help you make money. If he wants us to believe that, he can start by being more honest when he's selling you something.

At the third oak, the time will be... Carpenter carves functioning watches entirely from wood
At first glance, these delightful timepieces look like they could have been crafted by the very best Swiss manufacturers.
But they have instead been made by a humble carpenter with no watchmaking training whatsoever.
Ukrainian Valerii Danevych makes his functional wrist watches almost entirely out of wood, with the sole exception of a metal spring needed to propel the movement.
Scroll down for video
Timber timepiece: This watch has been carved almost entirely out of wood by carpenter Valerii Danevych
Wood you believe it? The only part that isn't timber is the metal spring needed to propel the movement Intricate: Valerii has had a fascination for wood since his early school days when he made a 3cm guitar using human hair for strings Talented: Later in life, Valerii moved on from restoring wooden objects and creating miniature artworks to making mechanical products Time for a change: Despite having no training as a watchmaker, he began working on functional wooden wristwatches in 2005
Coming from a long line of cabinetmakers, he has had a fascination for wood since his early school days when he made a 3cm guitar using human hair for strings.
As he grew up and his skills improved, he moved on from restoring wooden objects and creating miniature artworks to making mechanical products.
So in 2005, despite having no training as a watchmaker, he began working on functional wooden wristwatches.
Tree-mendous: It took a while for Valerii to determine which types of wood were most suitable for the tiny parts needed and to learn the basics of watchmaking
Different styles: Valerii mostly uses birch because of its strength and resistance, but also more exotic wood such as juniper and bamboo
It took a while for Valerii to determine which type of wood were most suitable for the tiny parts needed and to learn the basics of watchmaking.
But within three years he had completed his first functional wooden pocket watch.
According to Unique Watch Guide, he mostly uses birch because of its strength and resistance, but also more exotic wood such as juniper and bamboo.
Functional: Some of his watches have power reserves of 20 hours and are typically accurate to withing five minutes a day Honoured: Last year, in recognition of his impressive wooden watch contributions, Valerii was inducted into the Horological Academy of Independent Creators
Each type of wood gives his timepieces different textual beauty.
Some of his watches have power reserves of 20 hours and are typically accurate to withing five minutes a day.
WASHINGTON — Fifty members of the Senate have signed a letter to the N.F.L. to urge its leadership to press the Washington Redskins to change the team name in the aftermath of tough sanctions against the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers for racially charged comments.
The position embraced by half of the Senate, and the willingness of the lawmakers to sign a formal request to Commissioner Roger Goodell, escalated the fight over the name and represented an effort to put increasing pressure on the league, which receives a federal tax break, and the ownership of the team.
“The N.F.L. can no longer ignore this and perpetuate the use of this name as anything but what it is: a racial slur,” said the letter, which was circulated by Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, and endorsed by Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, the majority leader. “We urge the N.F.L. to formally support a name change for the Washington football team.”
Cantwell said that “we are going to find out if the N.F.L. can act against this kind of discrimination as quickly as the N.B.A. did.” She said she considered the Senate letter an important milestone.

AMY GOODMAN: In a Democracy Now! special today, we spend the hour with the world-renowned Chinese artist and activist Ai Weiwei. ArtReview magazine has called him the most powerful artist in the world. He's also been called the most dangerous man in China.
Ai Weiwei was born in 1957 in Beijing. His mother was writer Gao Ying. His father was the revered poet Ai Qing. The year after Ai Weiwei was born, his father was named an enemy of the people. He and his family, including 1-year-old Ai Weiwei, were sent to hard labor camp in the Gobi Desert in remote northwest China. Ai Weiwei spent the next 16 years of his life growing up in hard labor camps, with harsh living conditions and little formal education. The family had only one book: a large French encyclopedia.
At 19, Ai Weiwei and his family returned to Beijing, and he enrolled in the Beijing Film Academy to study animation. There, he became part of a group of avant-garde artists organizing against government control of the arts—their slogan, “We demand political democracy and artistic freedom.” He was also a part of a small political movement of students who produced posters calling for reforms, and pasted them on a brick wall that came to be known as the Democracy Wall.
When the leader of that movement was sentenced to 15 years in prison, Ai Weiwei decided to move to New York City. It was 1981. Ai Weiwei spoke no English, had $30 in his pocket. He settled in the Lower East Side and befriended Allen Ginsberg and other influential artists. He briefly studied at the Parsons School of Design, but dropped out after his professor told him his drawings had no heart. Instead, he held a string of odd jobs, working in construction, cutting grass, cleaning houses, babysitting, even winning money in Atlantic City as a blackjack guru.
In 1993, Ai Weiwei returned to China because his father was ill. He founded a highly influential architecture firm, named FAKE Design, and dedicated himself to art and writing. In 2008, after a massive earthquake in Sichuan, China, Ai Weiwei launched a citizen investigation to collect the names of the more than 5,000 schoolchildren who died, partially as a result of the highly shoddy government construction of the schools. Ai Weiwei was highly critical of the government's response to the earthquake, saying, quote, “They intimidate, they jail, they persecute parents who demand the truth, and they brazenly stomp on the constitution and the basic rights of man,” unquote.
While his citizen investigation catapulted him to international fame, it also enraged Chinese government officials. In 2009, his popular blog was shut down. A few months later, police broke into his hotel room and attacked him, punching him in the face and causing cerebral hemorrhaging. He had to have emergency brain surgery, which he documented in his film So Sorry.
Then he launched his most famous installation to date: a massive mosaic of 9,000 children's backpacks mounted on the exterior wall of the German art museum Munich Haus der Kunst. The backpacks spelled out in Chinese characters the words of one mother whose child was killed in the earthquake: quote, “She lived happily on this earth for seven years,” unquote.
In 2010, Ai Weiwei was placed under house arrest, after the Chinese government demolished his studio. Then, in 2011, he was arrested at the Beijing airport and held for 81 days without any charges. Chinese authorities seized his passport, refused to return it until 2015. Once that passport was returned, he moved to Berlin, Germany. He's also faced constant surveillance, a topic which he explored earlier this year in his exhibition Hansel & Gretel, set in New York's Park Avenue Armory, in which visitors are relentlessly tracked by cameras.
Among his other famous installations was his 2010 show Sunflower Seeds at the Tate Museum in London, in which Ai Weiwei filled a hall of the museum with more than 100 million hand-painted porcelain sunflower seeds. He currently has a solo exhibition at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C., called Trace. The exhibit features 176 portraits of activists and free speech advocates made of Lego bricks. He also has a major new exhibition opening next week here in New York City in which he's erecting security fences and cages across the boroughs, including under Washington Square Arch and in Central Park near Trump Tower, to explore the rise of nationalism and the closure of borders worldwide. It's called Good Fences Make Good Neighbors.
AI WEIWEI: The fence can be between neighbors to divide, to set up some kind of border. It's about territory, about dividing to push the others away or to stop others from crossing. Generally, it reflects a misunderstanding of humanity.
AMY GOODMAN: Ai Weiwei is also the director of a major new documentary on the struggle, the journey of refugees worldwide, called Human Flow. For the documentary, he traveled to 23 countries, visiting dozens of refugee camps. This is the trailer, which takes us to Iraq, Jordan, Gaza, northern Greece and Kenya.
UNIDENTIFIED 1: Being a refugee is much more than a political status. It is the most pervasive kind of cruelty that can be exercised against a human being. You are forcibly robbing this human being of all aspects that would make human life not just tolerable but meaningful in many ways.
UNIDENTIFIED 2: The more immune you are to people's suffering, that's very, very dangerous. It's critical for us to maintain this humanity.
CAPTION: Over 65 million people in the world today have been forcibly displaced from their homes.
REFUGEE 1: [translated] I've been roaming endlessly with my son for 60 days now. Nobody has shown us the way. Where am I supposed to start my new life?
UNIDENTIFIED 3: If children grow up without any hope, without any prospects for the future, without any sense of them being able to make something out of their lives, then they will become very vulnerable to all sorts of exploitation, including radicalization.
INTERVIEWER: [translated] Why are you here?
PALESTINIAN GIRL 1: [translated] We went for a stroll.
PALESTINIAN GIRL 2: [translated] For fun. It's the only place to escape in the big prison of Gaza.
UNIDENTIFIED 4: The officials came here and told them, “Look, there's no way you're going to get papers to continue. Either you go voluntarily, or we arrest you.”
CAPTION: Witness the global journey of millions of men, women and children filmed across 23 countries.
AI WEIWEI: I respect you.
REFUGEE 2: We have to respect you.
AI WEIWEI: I respect your passport, and I respect you.
UNIDENTIFIED 5: It's going to be a big challenge to recognize that the world is shrinking, and people from different religions, different cultures are going to have to learn to live with each other.
AMY GOODMAN: That's the trailer for the new documentary Human Flow. It's directed by Ai Weiwei, the internationally renowned Chinese artist. He'll be back with us live after break.
[break]
AMY GOODMAN: “Just Climb the Wall,” sung and written by Ai Weiwei. This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman. The United Nations says there are now more refugees worldwide than at any time since World War II. The journey and struggle of these 65 million refugees is the subject of Chinese artist and dissident Ai Weiwei's epic new documentary called Human Flow. For the documentary, Ai Weiwei traveled to 23 countries, dozens of refugee camps.
He joins us now in our New York studio, yes, the world-renowned Chinese artist, dissident, activist Ai Weiwei. He has received so many awards, including the 2015 Ambassador of Conscience Award from Amnesty International, the 2012 Václav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent from the Human Rights Foundation. He's now the Einstein visiting professor at the Berlin University of the Arts, also director and producer of this new documentary that's opening around the country, Human Flow.
Ai Weiwei, it's an honor to have you here.
AI WEIWEI: Thank you.
AMY GOODMAN: Talk about why you decided to make this epic film that took you across the world. You, a man, who have, yourself, been internally displaced in China, had to leave China. Talk about your life and how it intertwines with this story in the film.
AI WEIWEI: Well, 2015, I had got my passport back, so I can start to travel. I went to Germany. And in Germany, you're facing the reality about 1.2 million refugees come to the land. So it makes me wonder: Who are they? And I decided to go to Greece. And the last was to really look at those people and how they get on the land. So, in there, I met the first boat—
AMY GOODMAN: You went to Lesbos, in Greece?
AI WEIWEI: Yeah, Lesbos, in Greece. So, on the shore, I met the first boat approaching the shore. And, you know, I see those people—women, children and old people. Some are crying—you know, it's just an unthinkable situation—climbing down this little boat. And then another boat, another boat. You know, sometimes you have 30, 40 boats a day. And so, it made me really wonder and have a curiosity about what is really going on in the world today.
So I decided to move my studio to Lesbos. And, you know, we have 20, 30 people there, start filming. And eventually, we have to go to the other side, Turkey, and to go to the Middle East, and then go to Asia and Africa, to make this film. It's a very big film. It takes us about one year to finish. We visited about 23 nations, 40 camps, and interviewed about 600 people, and has 900 hours of footage.
AMY GOODMAN: So, you went to the Middle East, as well. Where did you go?
AI WEIWEI: We went to, first, Jordan, Lebanon and Israel, Gaza. Then our team also go to Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan. You know, all those places.
AMY GOODMAN: What did you find in Gaza?
AI WEIWEI: Gaza is a situation not people being pushed away from home, but being put in like a big jail. You know, millions of people stays in—basically in this—their border, and they cannot leave. So, the situation is extremely difficult. They only have very little resources, and many people survive only from the help from the United Nations. And the water, polluted. Electricity, only given a few hours a day. So, it's an extremely difficult situation.
AMY GOODMAN: And where did you go in Israel?
AI WEIWEI: Israel, I've been Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and West Bank, you know, Palestine area.
AMY GOODMAN: I want to turn to a clip from Human Flow, your new documentary. This is Dr. Cem Terzi from the Association of Bridging Peoples. He works with Syrian refugees in Turkey.
DR. CEM TERZI: There is nothing in this agreement in favor of refugees. Turkish law system only allowed them under the temporary protection. It means they have no international rights here. One day, the government decides, “I will send them back.” The government can do this, because they are not defined as a refugee. No international rights for them. They need a social integration program, job permits. They need jobs. They need a standard income and to buy food or to pay their rent. The children need to go to school. Majority of them, last five years, didn't go to school even one day.
AMY GOODMAN: So that's Dr. Cem Terzi from the Association of Bridging Peoples, who works with Syrian refugees.
AI WEIWEI: Yeah.
AMY GOODMAN: Tell us more about him and what you found there.
AI WEIWEI: The doctors were in tears. And they have been a major force to help the refugees in Turkey. And recently, he has been fired, and with 12 other professors, because a year ago they signed some peace treaty. So, many, many—even those doctors whose—his own life is threatened in Turkey. And their team really did a lot of work for helping refugees and, you know, to take medical care for them.
David Haye required surgery to repair his right shoulder
The 33-year-old Londoner, who won world titles at heavyweight and cruiserweight, has called off his planned bout against Tyson Fury on 8 February and may well have fought for the final time.
Hayemaker Boxing released a statement which read: "David underwent five hours of surgery in Germany on Thursday morning to reconstruct his right shoulder, and has since been told to seriously consider ending his glittering 11-year professional boxing career.
"The operation was to the right subscapularis and bicep tendon attachments, both of which were ruptured."
A crushing blow
Haye added: "I genuinely believed the shoulder injury wasn't that bad.
"But the doctor sent me for a detailed MRI scan and, within 24 hours, I was told the full extent of the damage. Twenty-four hours after that, I was in the operating theatre.
"It's a crushing blow for me. I had big plans for next year and the ultimate goal was to win back the world heavyweight title, something my amazing fans deserve.
"What I didn't anticipate was that this year would be the unluckiest of my career and that a number of injuries would disrupt my plans so much. Perhaps it just wasn't meant to be.
"The boxing Gods keep hinting that maybe enough is enough and that it's time to finally hang up my gloves."
But Haye has received little sympathy from planned opponent Fury who, after an initial rant on Twitter, issued a statement on his Team Fury website which read: "I'm absolutely furious but in all honesty this is exactly what I expected.
"Everyone knows I was very suspicious when he pulled out the first time and this confirms to me that he's always been afraid of me and never wanted this fight."
Fury's uncle and trainer Peter Fury also said he was not surprised at the news.
He said: "From the moment Haye postponed in September, it was obvious this fight wasn't going to happen.
"The public have been duped. Tyson will fight someone else in February. We'll get the show back on the road and we're glad we don't have to do business with these people ever again."
Having won the world cruiserweight title in 2007, Haye stepped up to heavyweight and claimed the world title when he beat Nikolai Valuev in November 2009.
However, after a pair of successful defences, he lost his title when he was beaten on points by Wladimir Klitschko in July 2011.
Haye proud of career
After a brief retirement, he returned to beat Dereck Chisora in the summer of 2012, but injuries have led to planned 2013 fights against Manuel Charr and Fury being called off.
Haye added: "The surgery and subsequent results are a bitter pill to swallow, because I truly felt I had a lot more to offer and was looking forward to paying back my loyal fans with some great fights in 2014.
"But I've been boxing for 23 years now, amateur and pro, and this has clearly taken its toll on my body.
"I can only offer my sincerest apologies to all those fans who have followed me over the years and, like me, wanted to finish on a real high. This wasn't how I wanted to end 2013.
"If I'm now destined to have won the European Championship, the Unified World Cruiserweight Championship and the WBA Heavyweight Championship of the world - with a record of 28 fights, 26 wins, 24 victories coming via knockout, and only two defeats - then so be it.
"I'm proud of these achievements and consider my boxing career a huge success."
At Thursday's Sound Transit Executive Committee meeting, the staff presented its proposal for the draft project list for Sound Transit 3. The board will amend and approve this draft list at this month's meeting and there will be public comment all summer. In the fall, Sound Transit will launch more detailed studies with refined cost and ridership estimates of all these projects. Next June, the Board may decide on overall package size and define its approach to subarea equity, allowing to pick from this menu of choices and determine what goes on the ballot.
Any worries that the study concepts last month limited the range of projects were unfounded. Nearly every project covered in one of last year's long-range plan studies appears here, with some new permutations. There are five categories of project:
ST2 Leftovers: anything voters approved in ST2 that ST had to defer due to the recession; most notably, Link to Star Lake. Existing system enhancements: infill stations, Sounder runs, DSTT improvements, etc. Corridors from the ST2 High Capacity Transit (HCT) studies: both the spine (North Everett/Tacoma Mall/Redmond) and “additional corridors” in Seattle and on the Eastside. Systemwide programs from the LRP: IT and access improvements, more corridor studies, financial reserves. Supporting System Expansion: vehicles, maintenance facilities, ST4 planning.
I've reproduced the other slides that have specific projects below. I chatted with ST bigwig Ric Ilgenfritz to clear up some points that might not be evident from the short descriptions.

Hogan Joins Group Of Governors Urging Bipartisan Health Care Solution
Gov. Larry Hogan joined a bipartisan group of 11 governors asking Congress to abandon efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
"Congress should work to make health insurance more affordable by controlling costs and stabilizing the market, and we are pleased to see a growing number of senators stand up for this approach. The Senate should immediately reject efforts to 'repeal' the current system and replace sometime later. This could leave millions of Americans without coverage," the governors said in a statement.
"The best next step is for both parties to come together and do what we can all agree on: fix our unstable insurance markets. Going forward, it is critically important that governors are brought to the table to provide input, and we stand ready to work with lawmakers in an open, bipartisan way to provide better insurance for all Americans."
The governors who put their name to the statement include Ohio Republican John Kasich, Pennsylvania Democrat Tom Wolf and Virginia Democrat Terry McAuliffe.
All states represented except Virginia have taken part in the Medicaid expansion. Medicaid would have seen cuts to future funding under the Senate plan Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell scuttled Monday night, after it became clear he didn't have the votes in his caucus.
Some Republicans, including Sen. John McCain of Arizona, have already suggested working with Democrats on a compromise measure.
German intelligence agent drove alleged perpetrator in Christmas market attack to Berlin
By Peter Schwarz
28 December 2016
One week after the attack on a Christmas market in Berlin, there is a growing chorus of demands for a massive strengthening of the state apparatus, the elimination of basic democratic rights, and the erection of new barriers against refugees.
At its upcoming congress at the start of January, the Bavarian-based Christian Social Union (CSU), part of the coalition government headed by its sister party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), plans to call for more personnel and better equipment for the security services, additional powers for law enforcement, more monitoring of emails and communications services such as Whatsapp and Skype, and increased data exchanges between the European Union countries.
This is despite the fact that the Berlin attack cannot be attributed to a lack of surveillance or police powers granted to the security and judicial authorities. On the contrary, the alleged perpetrator, Anis Amri, prepared his action literally under the eyes of the authorities. It has now emerged that the 24-year-old Tunisian was driven to Berlin by an undercover informant of the Intelligence Service (“Verfassungsschutz”), which closely monitored Amri for months before he drove a large truck into a crowd on December 19.
Amri had been imprisoned in Italy for four years for criminal offenses and was reportedly radicalized while in jail. In 2015, he was released and went to Germany, where he applied unsuccessfully for asylum. According to an investigation by the German television program “Report Munich,” he joined an Islamic network in which at least two spies for the German intelligence service were active.
On Friday evening, the ARD television program “Focus” (“Brennpunkt”) cited a file according to which an “informant” (“VP”) for the North Rhine-Westphalian state criminal office had already made contact with Amri at the end of 2015. “In the ensuing days, Amri stated that he wanted to carry out attacks in Germany using weapons of war (AK 47s, explosives),” the notation reads.
Between February and March of 2016, Amri was driven from Dortmund to Berlin by a “secret informant for the Intelligence Service” to whom he related his plans. The note in the file adds: “He was driven by VP and stated that his mission was to kill on behalf of Allah.”
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, at about the same time, the state criminal agency of North Rhine-Westphalia sent a report on the Islamic network in which Amri was active to the prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe. The top German criminal prosecutor commenced investigations into Amri on suspicion of support for and membership in a terrorist group. In November, he ordered the arrest of the head of the group, Abu Walaa, as well as other hard-core members.
Amri, however, remained free. Apparently, shortly after Amri had moved to Berlin with the help of agents of the state, the prosecutor's office handed over his case to the Berlin judiciary and encouraged it to investigate him on suspicion of preparing a major state-threatening act of violence—a lesser form of terrorism. The Berlin public prosecutor's office then began its own investigation on the suspicion that Amri was merely planning a burglary to obtain money for the purpose of buying weapons.
Amri was subsequently supervised and monitored by the Berlin security authorities until September. Then the surveillance was reportedly stopped, supposedly because there was no evidence pointing to an imminent offence. The authorities in Berlin refrained from arresting him, although they had ample legal authority given the fact that Amri was an asylum-seeker whose application had been rejected and who was suspected of terrorism.
It is totally beyond belief that the failure to arrest Amri was an “accident,” or was due to a lack of legal authority to take him into custody. Even Heribert Prantl, a lawyer who heads the internal affairs department of the Süddeutsche Zeitung, presumed on Friday that Amri was intentionally left alone.
He wrote: “Did the authorities accept the risks associated with Amri because they hoped that their surveillance would provide information? And did the supervising authority say nothing to other authorities because it wanted to keep the knowledge to itself?”
In fact, there are ample grounds to believe that sections of the state apparatus deliberately accepted the risk of such an attack in order to promote their own right-wing agenda. Fierce clashes have taken place in German ruling circles over refugee and security policy. Many regard Chancellor Angela Merkel as too soft to lead the government in times of major international and national tensions and mounting social conflicts. Under these circumstances, the attack is being used to intimidate the population and bring about a political change of course, possibly including a change of government.
The massive and unexplained evidence of state foreknowledge and even protection of the alleged perpetrator of the December 19 Berlin attack conforms to a by-now familiar pattern in regard to major terror attacks internationally. Such was the case in the November, 2015 attacks in Paris, the Boston Marathon bombings in April of 2013, and the 9/11 attacks in New York and Washington DC.
In each case, the Islamist forces involved in the attacks were linked either to despotic regimes allied to Washington, such as Saudi Arabia, to militias being used as proxy forces for US imperialism and its European allies in the Middle East, Central Asia and North Africa, or, in the case of the Boston Marathon attack, to CIA-backed Islamist separatists operating within the Russian Federation.
In all of these cases, the perpetrators had long been in the sights of the security forces, which refrained from intervening. In every case, the attacks provided the pretext for a massive buildup of the state apparatus. In France, the Socialist Party government of François Hollande seized on the Paris attacks to impose an indefinite state of emergency, which continues to this day. The Boston attacks were used to impose a martial-law-like lockdown and police-military occupation of a major American city. The September 11 attacks served as justification for the so-called “war on terror,” involving a series of devastating wars in the Middle East and the erection of a surveillance and police state apparatus in the US.
The Berlin attack is now being exploited for similar purposes. Although there is no connection with the refugees who came to Germany last year to escape the imperialist wars in Syria and other countries, and although the German security authorities knew of Amri's intentions, there is an unceasing drumbeat for a strict policing of borders and the construction of a totalitarian surveillance state.
On Tuesday, Spiegel Online predicted that the conflict “will be even sharper, even more polarizing, even dirtier leading up to the Bundestag (parliamentary) elections in September.” It noted that interior policy experts of all parties are discussing “a more consistent deportation policy, transit centres, video surveillance, and electronic foot-cuffs for Islamic threats.” It stated further that Chancellor Merkel, who has declared she is prepared to stand for election to a fourth term, does not fundamentally oppose these debates, but now “knows she has to deliver.”
Spiegel Online went on to declare that the “humanitarian imperative” was for yesterday. In 2017, Merkel would no longer be the “refugee chancellor,” but rather the security chancellor. She had to embody the “strong state” that she has herself invoked in order to secure support within “her own ranks.”
Similar reactions are being expressed internationally. In France, both the conservative Republicans (LR) and the far-right National Front are calling for the strengthening of borders. The Republicans spokesman Guillaume Larrivé declared: “Merkel's decision to open up borders has weakened the security of Europe, the whole continent. We need a different immigration policy, another security policy—both in Paris and Berlin.”
The British Spectator complained that while the issue at hand was the need to abolish the right to asylum, Germany was still “a prisoner of its past, scarred by the knowledge that the land of Goethe and Beethoven murdered six million Jews.”
The Week described Merkel's refugee policy as “a disaster.” It wrote: “She said that welcoming this enormous wave of refugees was the only way to be true to ‘European values.' But the current wave of terrorism and the enormous fear of crime and disorder in European cities is proving mortally dangerous not just to her own party, but to the European Union itself.”

Can you say “Roadtrip!” ? No, I wish we drove in this.
The Central Florida Bonsai Club has an annual fieldtrip in August where we visit Mary Madison's home in Lake Placid Florida. Mary is, indisputably, the Buttonwood Queen, owing to the fact that probably 80% of all buttonwoods that have been displayed in high profile shows were first collected from the wild by her. She specializes in rescuing the trees before the bulldozer rips them out of the ground to make way for another retirement condo or timeshare highrise.
I carpooled with Sandy, Don, and Dick (or Richard, I'm not sure what he went by). Here's Don riding his scooter at Mary's, perusing the wares.
That's Richard in the way back.
Then we have Judy in the back, Nanette in the front and the indomitable Paul Pikel sporting orange.
From front to back, the legend herself, Mary, Sandy, and Judy. And some heavy clouds just beginning. Look at that deadwood on the tree Sandy is holding! Looks like a snake about to strike.
I tried to warn Paul about not wearing a hat like Mary. The second pic is just moments later.
Talk about a red neck! That's gonna hurt.
August in Florida is no joke.
The traditional meal Mary serves when we have a group fieldtrip is….
….hot dogs, beans, potato salad and chips. And beer. Truly a feast for for royalty. And don't tell me anything about not eating clean, Mary is in her eighties and she still goes into the swamps and mangroves to collect trees. Although I will say that the yellow gunk on the dog is a local sweet pickle relish she likes.
She also dared me to try this atomic-green habanero suace she likes.
Just a little dab.. Actually, that's damn good. Maybe Mary's found the secret to longevity in this sauce?
There's nothing like talking with a legend over beer and meat formed into tubes. She even stepped up this year and offered us Sam Adams and Yeungling instead of the usual Miller Lite. Come to think of it, this beer might be left over from a certain person who visits Mary. Well, if it is, I'll gladly drink his beer. Bottoms up!
After lunch Mary decided to give a short demo for the group.
Cleaning the deadwood Some big cuts with big tools.
Sandy, wondering if this would root. Mary said, “Sure, you go ‘head and do it though. At my age, I don't need to be taking cuttings” A Q&A session after the work. Mary will use mostly organics in her soil for buttonwood because, she says, they love to be wet.
The Queen! She wanted me to say that she didn't wire the tree, so use your imagination.
So what did I get? I got this:
And what the hell is it? I went all the way to Mary Madison's home, she of the buttonwoods, and I come home with a…….winged elm. And, because I have a hole in my abdominal wall and people think I'm an invalid, the guy on the scooter drags my tree to the car for loading. Let's clean it up and cut it back.
Back at The Nook
We had to cut the tree out of the ground at Mary's.
It's a little weedy. You can see why I wanted it now. The elm was collected by Mary up in Ocala.
My plan is for a broom like look to the tree so I cut back all the lower growth.
Now to clean up the top.
It wants to grow straight up.
I just need one branch here.
There we go.
I could cut it here. But then I'd loose that elm look I'm going for.
I'll cut this one off. But leave a nub to encourage a new shoot.
And cut these down a bit.
I'm not sure of the final branches quite yet, it will depend on what grows.
I add some soil to the bottom of the old pot.
Some soil on top with fertilizer.
And lots of water. Next year I'll start on styling it. Which it needs, seriously. And I did leave a few leaves on it this time.
At least it's not a sharp stick in your eye. I think the next post will be a quick one on a buttonwood I got at Mary's two years ago and somehow I missed styling it last year. Here's a sneak peek.
See ya'
Leadership favourite says that the party's "core vote" isn't enough to win elections anymore
SCOTTISH Labour leadership hopeful Kezia Dugdale has said that Labour has been too concerned with the vulnerable and must also reach out to the vast majority of people who "want to better themselves" if it is to win power in Scotland again.
Dugdale is favourite to replace Jim Murphy as the party leader and has secured the backing of 88 per cent of Scottish constituency Labour parties (CLPs), as well as four trade unions.
However, her recent comments will disappoint those in the party who hope that she will reclaim the social-democratic ground lost to the SNP.
Dugdale said: "Too often in the recent past it has looked like we are only on the side of one group of people - the most vulnerable in society,
"Labour will always stand up for the weak and voiceless, but we also need to represent the vast majority who aren't struggling but just want to do better for themselves.
"In the recent past we haven't looked like a party on the side of those who want to get on in life. Under my leadership we will celebrate success - for individuals, families and communities all across this great nation of ours."
Dugdale faces competition from Eastwood MSP Ken Macintosh for the position. The party has lost vast swathes of support in Scotland in recent years and retained only one MP at the recent General Election.
Dugdale says she has been able to reach out to different sections of the Labour party and says the party "must do the same with the country".
"Our core vote isn't big enough to win elections anymore, if it ever was," she said.
"If the history of our party tells us anything it's that we win elections by reaching out beyond our natural supporters.
"We need a big tent plan, not a core vote strategy, to win again in Scotland."

While the media obsesses over the Mayweather–McGregor fight, there are a few major stories from the last week that will actually have an impact on your life.
(TFTP) Floyd Mayweather is taking on Conor McGregor on Saturday night in an epic boxing match that arguably won't have any profound effect on your life—unless you're betting money on the winner. However, the fanfare that has surrounded this latest bread-and-circus event has done its job by distracting the public from several stories that do, in fact, have an impact on everyday Americans and the future of the United States.
5. First of Its Kind Study Shows Undeniable Evidence Cannabis Can Treat Opioid Addition
As support for the legalization of cannabis and research of its impact on various diseases continues to grow in the United States, a first-of-its-kind experimental study is finally proving that there is undeniable evidence that cannabis can treat opioid addiction.
The study, which sought to determine “whether the cannabis constituent cannabidiol attenuates the development of morphine reward in the conditioned place preference paradigm,” shows how cannabis works to block the opioid reward in the brain:
“After drug-place conditioning, morphine mice displayed robust place preference that was attenuated by 10 mg/kg cannabidiol. Further, when administered alone, this dose of cannabidiol was void of rewarding and aversive properties. The finding that cannabidiol blocks opioid reward suggests that this compound may be useful in addiction treatment settings.”
4. Ron Paul Just Eviscerated Trump's Hypocritical Afghan War Narrative In An Epic Tweet Storm
When President Trump announced that the Afghanistan War still has no end in sight, former Texas Congressman Ron Paul responded with a series of Tweets that echo the sentiments many Americans feel towards the longest war in U.S. History, which has now spanned three administrations over 16 years.
Paul pointed out that “the military personnel are the victims of bad foreign policy,” and called out one of the hallmarks of U.S. foreign policy: “Sad that these wars the politicians argue for are unconstitutional yet we are told we are over there defending the Constitution.”

3. CNN Panel Backfires, Destroys Mainstream Media Narrative on Charlottesville
It is no secret that CNN has had better years, and that fact was evident this week when the network's citizen panel worked against it by shattering the mainstream narrative CNN has worked to promote in the wake of riots in Charlottesville, Virginia.
When panelists were asked if they were “troubled” by President Trump's response to the violence in Charlottesville—where he noted that there was “blame on both sides”—not a single panelist condemned Trump's response, and only one panelist specifically noted that there were “problems on both sides.”
2. NY Times Deletes Tweet After Internet Owned Them for Praising US-led GENOCIDE in Yemen
The New York Times is another mainstream media outlet that found the need to rework its agenda this week when it was forced to delete a tweet that praised the United States and Saudi Arabia's role in keeping Yemen “under close watch.”
“How did Yemen—a country under the close watch of the United States and Saudi Arabia—fall so swiftly into crisis?” read the tweet, which was met with furious backlash from those on the internet who have been following the conflict, which has arguably resulted in genocide in Yemen.
1. Congress Quietly Passes New Bill Allowing Warrantless Searches of Home
A bill that will allow homes to be searched without a warrant was passed with overwhelming support by the United States Congress, and signed into law by President Trump after it was opposed by only five members of Congress.
House Joint Resolution 76 looked harmless on the surface, but the members of Washington Metrorail Safety Commission it seeks to create will be given the authority to enter property near the Metro Rail System “without limitation” and without a warrant, for the purpose of “making inspections, investigations, examinations, and testing.”
Only 5 of us voted against bill allowing govt to enter/search private property in parts of VA, MD & DC w/o warrant. https://t.co/SVhTWqbPaB — Justin Amash (@justinamash) July 18, 2017
No matter who wins the great Mayweather – McGregor fight, the fact is that the United States is still killing innocent civilians in foreign nations, Congress is still passing laws that violate the U.S. Constitution, and the mainstream media is still pushing U.S. propaganda and distracting Americans with inflammatory coverage of the latest bread-and-circus battle of the moment.

A Shot at Glory is a film by Michael Corrente produced in 1999 and released in 2002, starring Robert Duvall and the Scottish football player Ally McCoist. It had limited commercial and critical success. The film features the fictional Scottish football club Kilnockie FC, based on a North of Scotland Highland Football League club, as they attempt to reach their first ever Scottish Cup Final. The final game is against Rangers.
Plot [ edit ]
Robert Duvall plays the club manager, Gordon McLeod. Jackie McQuillan (Ally McCoist) is the team's striker who has recently been signed from Arsenal. McQuillan is a legendary ex-Celtic player as well as the managers son-in-law, and has a reputation for being troublesome. The two men put their personal problems aside as they try to prevent the small fishing town of Kilnockie from losing its club, which is owned by an American (played by Michael Keaton) who wants to move the team to Dublin in Ireland.
Cast [ edit ]
Production [ edit ]
Filming took place at several locations across Scotland, including Boghead Park (the former ground of Dumbarton), Dumfries club Queen of the South's Palmerston Park ground, Kilmarnock's Rugby Park ground and Hampden Park. The majority of scenes representing the town of Kilnockie were filmed in Crail, Fife. Several extras in the film were then players of Raith Rovers, including future Celtic player Didier Agathe. Duvall regularly went to see Raith Rovers to learn from John McVeigh, the manager, on whom his character was based.
Soundtrack [ edit ]
A soundtrack for the film was written by Mark Knopfler featuring drums from Craig Lennon.

Islamic State: Mother only discovered son Ashley Johnston was fighting in Syria after his death
Updated
Amanda Johnston only discovered her son Ashley was at war with Islamic State (IS) in Syria when she learned of his death last week.
Mr Johnston became the first westerner killed fighting for a growing counter-jihadi movement in Syria and Iraq when he was ambushed and shot by IS militants in north-eastern Syria.
Senior security sources told the ABC's 7.30 program Mr Johnston was among three Australians fighting with the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), including former Northern Territory Labor Party president Matthew Gardiner.
A fourth Australian, Khamis Gewargis, is fighting against IS with Assyrian forces in Iraq.
Counter-terrorism authorities believe Johnston, a 28-year-old Canberra postman and Army reservist, was lured to fight with the YPG by offshore recruiters operating on Facebook using the same methods that have proved so effective for IS.
Ms Johnston told 7.30 that her son revealed he was in the Middle East on December 30, when he sent a text message saying he was doing "humanitarian work" to support the Kurds.
"We asked Ash questions: 'What was he doing? Who is he with?'" she said.
"I said to him, 'You haven't gone and joined some group and you're not doing something you're not telling me?'
"And he would either not answer me or he would just say, 'No, Mum. I haven't, I'm fine', so we had really no idea of what was going on.
"There's still so much that we don't know. We are still finding out things but it wasn't until after he was killed that we found out where he was and who he was with."
Johnston 'killed protecting his comrades'
Mr Johnston had long dreamed of fighting a war.
He trained to join the Australian Army and spent seven years in the Army Reserves, serving for several months as a peacekeeper in the Solomon Islands.
The postman and bottle shop manager also tried unsuccessfully to join the Special Forces and the British Royal Marines, before finding his calling late last year with a motley crew of international fighters and Kurdish militia engaged in a fierce fight-back against IS in northern Syria and Iraq.
Mr Johnston's comrades told his mother he was killed while trying to protect them when their tank broke down last week near the besieged town of Tel Hamis.
"They were encircled by ISIS fighters who were closing in and Ash jumped out of the vehicle to, I guess, draw them away and he was shot, but it gave the others in the vehicle the chance to get out and he saved their lives," Ms Johnston said.
"I guess they were able to continue on doing what they needed to do and that's why I know that it's definitely Ash.
"He would put other people in front of his own wellbeing. I guess that actually didn't surprise me.
"The fact where he was and what he was doing and the extent of it, that was really confronting but to know that Ash did what he did, that was devastating, but that didn't surprise me that he would do that for his mates."
Kurds working to bring body home
Mr Johnston is now being mourned as a hero by Kurds in Syria, Iraq and Australia, who are working to bring his body home on a perilous mission through Syria.
Tributes have also flowed from international comrades including Dean Parker, an American surfing instructor who trained with him in Syria and laid a wreath for him at the Australian Embassy in Washington last week.
"I met Ash in Rojava, right on the Rabiah border crossing, one of the command posts," he told 7.30.
I think sometimes what's legal and what are morally right can be two different things. Legally, the Government might say he has done the wrong thing and he is a criminal but I would not class him as that. I think that morally, he's done what he thinks was right. Amanda Johnston
"He had come in with a new unit of fighters and we spent about three weeks together there and we learnt our Kurmanji.
"Ash dove right into the language, he would spend an hour practising his Kurdish and then we would practise with the YPG/YPJ fighters.
"He fit right in with the Kurds. Really relaxed, always with a smile on his face, just a really good-hearted, really good human being.
"We were only together for about three weeks but he made a pretty strong impression on me.
"The world needs more people like Ash. Without a doubt, he was truly one of the best people I have ever met."
Kurdish forces pose with IS fighters killed in Johnston's honour
On Facebook, the Kurdish forces hailed Mr Johnston as a martyr and posed with the bodies of IS fighters killed to avenge his death.
The macabre photos alarmed Australian authorities, who warned fighting with groups like the YPG was a crime that carried the same penalties as fighting with IS: up to 20 years in jail under the Foreign Incursions Act.
"They will face the full raft of powers available to law enforcement to deal with it," AFP Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan said.
"They're still committing a criminal offence.
"The same issues potentially that arise for someone fighting for Islamic State face someone fighting for the Kurds.
"They're exposed to weapons use, they're exposed to violence, hatred and obviously, I'm concerned about mental health issues when they return."
However, Mr Gaughan suggested Australians fighting against IS could be treated more lightly in the courts.
"It's a very technical piece of law," he said.
"The black and white of it is, yes, they are committing a criminal offence; however, there are some other considerations which need to be taken into account and one of those being that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions needs to be satisfied that it's in the best public interest to run a prosecution.
"Of course, if the person does go before a court, it's up to a judge or a magistrate to determine the sentence and factors could be taken into account for mitigation of sentence."
The last thing Ms Johnston wants is for her son's death to inspire other would-be fighters, but she insists Mr Johnston was no criminal.
"If I had known that Ash was going to do what he did, I would have done everything I could to stop him going," she said.
"I don't want any other family to go through what we're going through.
"But I believe that Ash didn't believe he was committing a crime. I believe that he would have looked at the moral side of it — that these people needed help and he wanted to help them.
"I think sometimes what's legal and what are morally right can be two different things. Legally, the Government might say he has done the wrong thing and he is a criminal but I would not class him as that.
"I think that morally, he's done what he thinks was right."

PARKER — The whole room erupted, but Derrick White remained calm answering the call. White dreamed of this moment, he had three dreams about it Wednesday night, but it all became reality Thursday night when the San Antonio Spurs selected him 29th overall in the NBA draft.
“It's crazy, man. It's crazy,” said White, who launched onto the draft scene after a successful “one and done” senior year at the University of Colorado. “I'm just a kid from Parker. It's more than I ever imagined.”
Sitting in the basement media room of a family friend's home in Parker, White was ambushed with hugs, kisses and bro handshakes from a collection of people who meant the most to him — from family to friends to former coaches and his longtime trainer, Marcus Mason.
Five years ago, a coach from NCAA Division II New Mexico Highlands concluded White couldn't play for his team. Metro State and nearly every Division I and II program passed too. Thursday, White proved them all wrong as he became the first senior drafted and the crown of the Spurs' draft class.

CU coach Tad Boyle called it. “He's going here, watch, he's going here,” Boyle said moments before the selection. Boyle talked to Spurs general manager R.C. Buford shortly after the pick, thanking him. Then he handed the phone to White.
It was the first of two emotional phone calls White would have Thursday night. The second, from Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich, left White in tears.
“They're champions. The Spurs way – they get their players better and they win,” White said before biting into a Spurs cookie and leading a ‘Go Spurs Go' chant. “You watch Pop, he's one of best coaches of all-time. For him to call me and talk to me, it's something I never dreamed of. I'm excited.”
Rocking a navy blue suit with “dare to be great” emboldened on the bottom of his left pant leg, White began to soak in the start of his NBA journey a little before 9 p.m. Thursday night. By 10 p.m., he finally was grasping the significance.
“This chip is going to stay on my shoulder,” White proclaimed. “If I lose it, I'm going to be out of the league quickly. I got plenty of work to do. I'm going to get back in the gym. I gotta get better.”
“Dare to be great” is a slogan created by his dad, Rich, more than 15 years ago and it's become the staple of White's draft thought process.

“It's take your shot to be the best you can be. Don't worry about, ‘Hey, I might fail,' dare to be great,” Rich said. “Aim high. Go for it. Have full confidence. Last night, he said that's what it means: to be ultimately confident in what I can do. And if I'm confident then good things are going to happen.”
White didn't lack for confidence Thursday night. He wasn't nervous, or he hid it well, joking and taking pictures, acting like the party with 50-plus guests wasn't for him. That's who White is, his closest friends say, “a guy's guy” who can be incredibly humble no matter the circumstances.
“You would never think the person you meet off the floor is the person you see on the floor,” said Alex Welsh, who played with White at Division II CU-Colorado Springs his first three years. “For me, he's always had a switch.”
Childhood friends, Cory Calvert and Reece Elliott, interrupted simultaneously: “Nothing's changed. He still has the same smile, still talks trash. He doesn't even know how good he is.”

White and his quartet of best friends – Welsh, Calvert, Elliott and his former CU roommate Josh Repine – took the light rail from the Rockies game Thursday afternoon to the draft party. He signed autographs and took pictures for everyone that asked.
His story, of course, is different from most of Thursday night's other draft picks. No one knew – from White's parents to best friends – that White's NBA dream was realistic until a year or two into his college career.

Mason kept seeing White hold his own in workouts against players from top-tier Division I programs. Former Nuggets star Chauncey Billups, who White idolized growing up, told Mason that White had an NBA chance if the skinny guard could better his body.
White accepted the challenge, hitting the weight room like an animal. He transformed from a 6-foot, 150 pound stick of a guard at Legend High School to the 6-5, 200 pounds Spurs guard he is today.
“He's tasted the worst, he's paid his dues and now he's getting exactly what he deserves,” Calvert said. “It couldn't have happened to a better person.”
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP)
Coach Ken Whisenhunt is close to wrapping up his coaching staff with the Tennessee Titans hiring Giff Smith as the new defensive line coach and Bob Bostad (BOE-stad) as the offensive line coach.
The Titans announced the hirings Thursday.
Article continues below ...
Whisenhunt said he liked Smith's versatility having worked in both the 3-4 and 4-3 defenses and still get production from players. Most of Smith's 22 years of coaching experience is in the college ranks, but he spent three seasons coaching the Buffalo Bills' defensive line between 2010 and 2012 where he helped Mario Williams turn in 10 1/2 sacks in 2012 with defensive tackle Kyle Williams earn a Pro Bowl berth in 2010.
”I know from having to play against him two years ago what a difficult challenge it was facing that group and how well he handled them,” Whisenhunt said in a statement. ”So we are excited to get Giff here to work with our defensive line.”
Smith also coached the defensive line at Georgia Tech between 2004-09 and has worked at Tulane, Georgia Southern. He started his coaching career as a graduate assistant at Arkansas and Georgia. The Yellow Jackets led the nation in sacks in 2007, and Smith coached current Titans defensive end Derrick Morgan to Atlantic Coast Conference defensive player of the year in 2009 with 12 1/2 sacks in 2009.
He was a three-time All-America defensive end at Georgia Southern where he was on three I-AA national championship teams. The Titans had 36 sacks in 2013 as a defense with Morgan leading the ends with six sacks and tackle Jurrell Casey having a team-high 10 1/2 sacks.
Bostad has 24 years of coaching experience and spent the past two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as offensive line coach. He also was the run game coordinator for six seasons at Wisconsin coaching first tight ends and then the offensive line producing four All-Americans.
Whisenhunt said he has heard plenty about Bostad from people he trusts and he also likes how Bostad's offensive lines play.
”I thought it was a good match for what we want to do,” Whisenhunt said. ”Another thing that impressed me about him was a number of guys that he developed that have gone on to play in the NFL. That is good sign, that he can coach and develop that type of player, which is important for a line coach.”
With the Buccaneers, Bostad helped coach a line that blocked as rookie Doug Martin ran for 1,454 and allowed only 26 sacks. The Titans gave up 37 sacks in 2013.
Bostad also has coached at New Mexico, San Jose State, Cal State Northridge and Minnesota. He was a four-year starter at linebacker at Wisconsin.
Serendipity – Disney Dining, 1984
It's hard for “the kids today” to understand what it was like to be a Disney fan in the days before the internet. For those of us outside the Disneyana hotbed of southern California, pretty much all we knew about the parks came from what Disney deigned to tell us in its official publications. This meant a new picture book about the parks every five years or so, and, of course, the much-anticipated quarterly arrival of Disney News.
For those of us on the east coast, who were unlikely to even know anyone who had ever been to Disneyland, any real impression of that park whatsoever had to come from one of two sources. First, there were the re-runs of Walt's old Wonderful World of Color shows that aired on the Disney Channel and every afternoon on the local syndicated station. Every once in a blue moon, if you were lucky, you'd catch something like From Pirates of the Caribbean to Tomorrowland, and that would give you a hint of what the park had been like in Walt's day. Most then-current news of what was going on at Disneyland, however, came from Disney News. With only a couple of articles a year focusing on some aspect of the park, though, any picture or a bit of information had to be picked apart obsessively to try and get a feel for the park as a whole. And with so little information to go on, it's bizarre what little details would stick in one's mind.
That brings us to today's post. “Disney Serendipity” was the name of a feature that ran in Disney News during the early to mid-1980s. Photographed and (presumably) written by the mysterious Dawn and Max Navarro, these two-page spreads covered, in the words of the column, “Serendipity – that wonderfully rare word used to describe the finding of valuable or agreeable things that you really weren't looking for, but were happy to have found.”
These features focused on the more obscure aspects of the Disney park-going experience, typically involving shopping or dining (and never failing to mention the corporate sponsors of each shop or restaurant). When most news tended to focus on major new attractions or park entertainment, these “slice of life” pieces were a real window into what the real Disneyland and Walt Disney World experience was like for visitors. Maybe that's why they made such an impression on young readers, who thought “Wow – the restaurants in Disneyland are different than they are in Walt Disney World!”
Here's a column from the Fall, 1984 issue of Disney News.
Disney News continues its series on Serendipity – that wonderfully rare word used to describe the finding of valuable or agreeable things that you really weren't looking for, but were happy to have found. This issue concentrates on tasty treats, unique in their Disney presentation in a Disney theme park; presented to park visitors in association with noted corporate participants.
Let Your Nose Be Your Guide That irresistible buttery aroma can only be coming from one of the brightly painted popcorn wagons serving Orville Redenbacher's Gourmet Popping Corn. Golden fresh corn … popping, popping, continuously! In convenient locations throughout the Disneyland and Walt Disney World Magic Kingdoms.
The Bear Necessities When you're hungry as a bear and looking for the bear necessities, scout out the Hungry Bear Restaurant in Frontierland at Disneyland Park. Snuggled away amongst the trees of Bear Country, this outdoor eating place offers lunches and dinners in the log cabin-like atmosphere of a wilderness setting overlooking the Rivers of America, where the Mark Twain glides silently by. Before or after enjoying that foot-stompin', country-western revue called Country Bear Jamboree, yer gonna welcome somepin tasty in yer tummy!

Deli Delights A spontaneous decision may be to lunch at the Heidelberger's Deli (hosted by Hormel) while shopping in Walt Disney World Village. But choosing what you want in the way of a sandwich isn't that easy. The wow selection of sandwiches starts with four different kinds of breads and five types of rolls, and a wild assortment of meats and cheeses will provide any sandwich combination you may desire. Each comes with one more decision: potato salad, cole slaw, sauerkraut, or dieters' applesauce, cottage cheese or special cucumber salad. Domestic beers and soft drinks will quench your Florida thirst. Eat indoors, or on the outdoor terrace framed in blossomed crepe myrtle tree foliage. And save room for the final selection; marble cheese cake, fresh pie, brownies or fruit. Decisions. Decisions.
Sara Lee's Wonderful Kitchen Surprises No visit to Main Street, USA in the Magic Kingdom of Walt Disney World is complete without sampling the old-fashioned flavor and atmosphere of the Sara Lee bakery. A delightful little tearoom with cozy round tables and cane chairs sets the mood for a light breakfast or a well-deserved coffee break. Try a Danish, pastry, brownie, coffee cake, or a slice of scrumptious whipped cream cake. There's a Sara Lee bakery in the Walt Disney World Village too.
Did You Say Mickey Mouse Pancakes? Have breakfast with Mickey… Mickey Mouse pancakes that is (although Mickey himself may surprise you with a visit here). These big-eared treats are the main attraction of the buffeteria at River Belle Terrace, hosted by Hormel, in Disneyland Park. The Terrace serves other breakfast specials too, overlooking the water's edge between Frontierland and New Orleans Square. You can watch the Mark Twain puffing its way past Tom Sawyer's Island. Also enjoy lunch or dinner – outside under bright umbrellas or indoors in a pleasant solarium with white lace iron work and garden motif. Join writer Mark Twain in spirit with a Tom Sawyer sandwich or, a Becky Thatcher serving of Spaghetti with Smoked Sausage. For the youngsters, there are River Captain specials. Since breakfast is served all day, with a delicious array of morning delights, you may want to start your day all over again.
Carnation Ice Cream Parlor Imagine the Matterhorn attraction covered with whipped cream instead of snow. Then order a giant Matterhorn Sundae at the Disneyland Carnation Ice Cream Parlor on Main Street, USA, and introduce your fantasy to reality. Other super creamy delights are the Victorian Banana Split, Town Square Soda and Black Cow. All served in old-fashioned ice cream parlor glass containers on lacy paper doilies. Tasty pita bread and hearty sandwiches are served here too, just in case you don't want to begin your meal with an ice cream aperitif. Relax outside beneath giant red and white umbrellas, or turn back the calendar seated at the turn-of-the-century soda fountain. The cool atmosphere is as delicious as the ice cream, hot fudge, nuts and cherries. Mmmmmmm! Mmmmmmm! Carnation!
Coke Is It! Coca-Cola, created by J. S. Pemberton in 1886, is right at home in the nostalgia of the Disneyland Park's Main Street, USA Coke Corner (and also at the Refreshment Corner of Walt Disney World). This popular refreshment is served in a stylish turn-of-the-century parlor with Coke memorabilia and white wrought iron soda fountain chairs. A pianist plunks out familiar tunes on a white upright piano. Try a Coke with a traditional hot dog and chips. In contrast, Coke is served as the drink of the future at the Tomorrowland Terrace where you may enjoy this contemporary favorite while listening to live musical entertainment. Coke is it… a timeless refreshment.

Some good news for Snap: Despite its sluggish business and slumping stock price, Snapchat still dominates among teenagers, a core demographic that represents the future wave of internet consumers and what they care about.
RBC Capital published the latest update to its regular social media survey this week, and a few things stood out — especially in the battle over teenagers, where Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook are all fighting for the next generation's attention.
A few key points from the survey:
Some 79 percent of U.S. 13- to 18-year-olds surveyed said they have a Snapchat account, more than any other type of social media. Of that age group, 73 percent have an Instagram account and just 57 percent say they are on Facebook.
Respondents had to choose only one social network they could keep if they were “trapped on a deserted island.” This time, 44 percent of teens picked Snapchat, ahead of Instagram (24 percent) and Facebook (14 percent). One year ago, for RBC's same survey question, the percentage of teens who insisted on keeping Snapchat on a desert island led with 28 percent — suggesting the app is still growing in necessity/popularity among young people.
Snapchat users said the most important feature inside the app is messaging (68 percent), not Stories (28 percent) or Discover (4 percent). That's interesting because the general belief is that Instagram's decision to clone Snapchat Stories last year really hurt Snapchat in 2017. But Instagram is also trying to build out its direct messaging product, again cloning parts of Snapchat's experience. If messaging is even more important to Snapchat than Stories, it's possible that a successful version by Instagram could be even more damaging to Snapchat. (And now we can also see why Instagram hasn't hurried to build a Snapchat Discover competitor full of publisher content.)
This notion that Snap is popular with teens has been popular the last couple of months. Data from comScore released in August found that Snapchat was still more popular among teens than Instagram, as did other data from Piper Jaffray in October.
But if you're a Snap investor, you probably can't hear it enough.
After being down four goals with 35 minutes left on Saturday, the Hershey Bears have rattled off ten goals and two wins. The Bears current line-up looks a lot different than it did a few weeks ago. Centerman Chandler Stephenson is still injured with an upperbody injury, Zach Sill is still called up to Washington and currently suspended. Aaron Ness and Ryan Stanton are working Washington's blue line as Brooks Orpik and John Carlson are both on injured reserve. Despite all of that, the Bears are staying strong, taking games a weekend at a time.
This upcoming set of games will mark the halfway point of the season for the Bears. After three-and-a-half months of play, head coach Troy Mann is happy with this young team's progress. “I think that we're probably ahead of the curve in terms of how much youth we have in. We've had some significant pieces out of the line-up on a consistent basis whether because it's of Washington's injuries or our injures. I look at today's [Wednesday] practice and we had six guys [out]; three call-ups, a guy out with the flu, and two pretty good injuries. We're right where we need to be, but certainly we'd love to make a push in the second half.”
On Friday, the Bears announced they recalled defenseman Joey Leach from South Carolina. If you were to use deductive reasoning from Wednesday's practice, the call-up looks like it is for Mike Moore, who was missing from Bears practice Wednesday when Mann said they were missing a player due to the flu.
Later on Friday, Barry Trotz said after practice in Madison Square Garden, the Bears could lose another forward if Marcus Johansson is suspended for his hit to the head of Thomas Hickey on Thursday. Trotz said the two players they were looking at recalling are Paul Carey or Chris Bourque if Johansson does get suspended.
Even if the Bears roster is depleted even more, there was at least one good sign Wednesday as Jakub Vrana returned to the ice, using a puck for the first time since major wrist surgery in early November. Mann said Vrana was heading to the doctor Wednesday afternoon. “Hopefully he gets a little bit of approval we can wrap it up where maybe he's a few games away. He hasn't really been approved for any kind of contact, but at least he's doing the first 20 minutes [of practice], he's getting out with [Ryan Murphy] early for the skills session. Just to have him on the ice in full gear is progression.”
Hershey currently sits seven points behind Wilkes-Barre with the Penguins having two games in hand. Hershey kicks off the weekend with a game in Rochester Friday and Syracuse Saturday, before returning home Sunday to take on Utica.

Sometime during practice, one of the Bears broke the glass in the south end. We wonder who it might be…
Royce chocolate is one of the Japanese chocolate brand that famous in both Japan and Thailand. It is one of my favorite chocolate brand also but the price here is almost double the price in Japan. So sad. :(
Royce Nama Chocolate Champagne (Pierre Mignon).
C ontent: 20 pieces (
125 g)
Ingredients; Fresh Cream, Cocoa butter, Sugar, Whole milk powder, Champagne, brandy, chocolate liquor, cocoa powder, butter, soy lecithin, artificial flavor.
Storage Temperature: Below 10°C/50°F
ROYCE` Nama Chocolate is the
combination of chocolate and cream with liqueur.
These are delicious the texture very smooth and easily melts in your mouth even though you just take it out from refrigerator. Taste of rich chocolate with milk and a bit of bitter taste from cocoa powder. It contains champagne but the taste of champagne is very hard to detect.
The problem is that the chocolate is supposed to be refrigerated all the time and the expiration of the chocolate is quite short approximately one month .

26 The considerable problems with the right to self-determination are, of course, not by themselves an argument against the legal dimension of self-determination. But they show that legal and extra-legal aspects are probably more strongly intermingled in self-determination than with other rights and principles. In light of this, one seems well advised to look beyond the mere status issue of self-determination. Whether self-determination is to be understood as a right or not does not seem to be the decisive issue. The broader dimension of self-determination seems relatively more important. To understand self-determination as a principle that is flexible, that underlies the whole international order, and that informs, shapes, and contributes to the development of international law, seems a more promising approach. Only in this way can self-determination develop its full potential.
27 Two ‘intermediate' functions seem particularly important in this regard: the aid provided by the principle of self-determination in the interpretation of existing international law (see paras 28–29 below; see also Interpretation in International Law) and its character as a basic source of legitimation for the development and alteration of international law (see paras 30–44 below). Applications of the latter function can be seen in the expansion of the principle of self-determination beyond decolonization, accompanied by a focus on (i) internal self-determination; (ii) in the application of the principle to a people that lives in two separate States, thus enabling (re-)unification; and (iii) in the controversy surrounding the right to secession, fuelled by the Kosovo case (see paras 41–44 below).
An important function of the principle of self-determination stems from its inclusion among the purposes of the UN proclaimed in Art. 1 UN Charter . As such it appears as a guiding principle in clarifying the functions and powers of the organization and the rights and duties of its members. In some provisions the UN Charter refers either explicitly or implicitly to these purposes. Therefore the terms of Art. 2 (3) UN Charter , according to which all members are obliged to ‘settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security,, are not endangered' (emphasis added) might be understood to refer, among other things, to the principle of self-determination. The same idea is more clearly expressed in Art. 14 UN Charter by virtue of which the UNGA may
(b) Self-Determination as a Guiding Principle for the Development of International Law
30 The principle of self-determination in its modern conception also appears as a principle of legitimacy underlying and inspiring the evolution of international law. Thus, self-determination is proclaimed by the UN and especially by the developing countries as an essential feature of the emerging international law of development and in particular in the establishment of a new international economic order (NIEO) (see also Development, International Law of). In its economic context the principle is understood as the right of peoples to economic development and to full and effective exercise of State sovereignty, including, as a basic constituent, the right of any State to reintegrate its national wealth and resources into the national assets and to use them in the interests of the economic development and well-being of its people.
31 Self-determination also served as a guiding principle in the process of redrawing the Eastern European and Balkan map after the end of the Cold War (1947–91). Here, international law seems to have developed in a new, important direction: based on the Declaration on the ‘Guidelines on the Recognition of New States in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union' adopted by the Council of Ministers of the European Community, and inspired by the relevant Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) documents such as the Charter of Paris for a New Europe and Supplementary Document to Give Effect to Certain Provisions of the Charter of 21 November 1990, the international community only seems to recognize the statehood of the newly emerging entities in Eastern Europe and on the Balkan if certain substantial preconditions—apart from self-determination, also protection of human rights, rule of law, democracy, and protection of minorities—are fulfilled. Thus, according to this new approach, when a new State is to be recognized, an assessment must be made to see whether the new entity has earned sovereignty and statehood or not. The principle of self-determination is one important element that needs to be taken into account in this assessment.
32 The international community obviously involved itself in guiding and accompanying the process of restructuring former Yugoslavia in an extensive way (see also Yugoslavia, Dissolution of). Thus, the Arbitration Commission of the Conference on Yugoslavia (Badinter Commission (for the Former Yugoslavia)), set up by the Council of Ministers of the European Economic Community on 27 August 1991, handed down important legal opinions, inter alia Opinion No 2 on the right to self-determination of the Serbian population in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Moreover, the UN engaged in large-scale peacekeeping as well as peace-enforcement operations with humanitarian aid as one of their main goals (UN Protection Force; [‘UNPROFOR']) and, on the basis of the Dayton Agreement (General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was mandated to safeguard security with the help of military units (Implementation Force; [‘IFOR']; Stabilisation Force; [‘SFOR']), whilst the OSCE was commissioned under the Dayton Agreement to ensure the implementation of human rights and to monitor elections (see also Election Monitoring, International). In Kosovo, based on UNSC Resolution 1244 (1999) of 10 June 1999, the UN is in charge of the interim administration (UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo; [‘UNMIK']) while the NATO and the Member States are in charge of the security presence (Kosovo Force; [‘KFOR']). However, notwithstanding this involvement of the international community, it must be noted that the impact of the principle of self-determination in the dismemberment of both the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia was relatively low (see also Dismemberment of States). Rather, these processes seem to have been factual rearrangements of power that were taking place outside the formal structures of international law and that were recognized ex post.
(ii) Reunification 40 A further issue of the principle of self-determination is related to the right of self-determination of peoples or nations living in divided States. It has been strongly advocated that a nation that has been divided into two States by outside interference and without the clear consent of the population still possesses the inherent right of self-determination including the right of reunification. The reunification in 1990 of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic obviously lends weight to this argument. This case can clearly be considered as a self-evident and peaceful manifestation of the principle of self-determination. Other actual cases however, such as the case of North and South Korea, are usually connected with far-reaching political controversies, pushing the legal considerations of self-determination to the background.
ASP.NET development has come a long way. It's now easier to practice Test Driven Development (TDD) thanks to ASP.NET MVC and all the open source tools out there from Ninject to Moq to Entity Framework Code First. But one thing remains real sucky in the .net world and that is deployment. Have you tried deploying an Azure application? It sucks and I hate Azure for it. I created a web service using Python and deployed it on Google AppEngine and it was much faster to create, easier to maintain and deploy even though I knew zero Python. Deploying a site to IIS is a pain in the butt.
I have always been envious of how easy it was/is to deploy a rails app. It takes seconds and usually one command line. It is just awesome. So, I was really excited when a few weeks ago I ran across AppHarbor and it looked too good to be true. I thought I would see how easy it would be to create a site and deploy it. Instead of creating an app from scratch though, I am going to create an Orchard website. If you haven't seen Orchard, go check it out. It's really cool. It's a CMS/Blog engine written in ASP.NET MVC and is open source and very extensible.
Prerequisites: Setup git on your computer, see this link for instructions.
So, here is how to get a website up and running in seconds…
1 – Login to AppHarbor and create a new application
2 – Change your new application settings to enable write-access to the file system
3 – Start WebMatrix and create a new site from Web Gallery
4 – Choose Orchard and name your website
5 – Open up a command prompt (I use Console2)
6 – Change to the path of your new website e.g. cd c:\websites\mywebsite
7 – run the following commands
git init
git add .
git commit –m “initial commit”
git remote add appharbor https://eibrahim@appharbor.com/MyWebsite.git (the URL will be unique to your app)
git push appharbor master (enter your AppHarbor password)
8 – Visit your new site on appharbor, in this example the site is located at http://mywebsite.apphb.com/
9 – DONE!!! Just follow the prompts to setup Orchard
You have just deployed a web app and have it hosted for free. You can easily scale it using AppHarbor's cloud infrastructure. It is simply awesome.
Another cool feature is that every time you want to deploy a new version, you simply commit your changes and run the git push command above. AppHarbor maintains different versions of your app and you can easily switch between versions. So if you deployed a bad version, you simply click a link and deploy the last working version.
I personally haven't deployed a scalable app on AppHarbor, so I would love to hear your feedback on how well the scaling works and if it is cost-effective or not.
Alright! I'm finally back! Hope you all enjoy chapter 2 of The Beacon Corps! ^_^
The trainees all remained lined up in their orderly stances, having mixed feelings of excitement and anxiety about the things yet to come. Ozpin took a step forward and into the crowd, "When I call upon you, I want you to say your name and the district your from, as well as why you wanted to be soldier." He started walking over to a tall, blond teenage boy. "Young man, who are you?"
"Jaune Arc, sir!" The young man saluted. "I come from the Vale District, and I wanted to join the military because my father and grandfather before me were soldiers as well, sir!"
"So, you want to live up to their legacy is what you are saying?"
"Yes, sir! As a member of the Arc bloodline, it is my duty to aid Humanity in their fight to survive!"
"I see. You have a strong resolve, Arc, I'm sure your ancestors would be proud." Ozpin then walked over to another young male, a little taller than Jaune, and with burnt orange hair. "And you, young man?"
He saluted, "Cardin Winchester, sir! I too come from the Vale District."
"And why did you want to join the military?"
"To show the Faunus who's boss..." Cardin smirked, inciting a few laughs from a few of the other trainees, while a few select others took his remark personally.
Ozpin glared. "Hmmm, I don't quite see how that is a motivation. If you're serious about joining the military, realize that you have a duty to both mankind and Faunus-kind. I hope you understand that." The orange haired boy rolled his eyes and groaned, while a certain black-haired girl overheard their conversation, suddenly turning her attention to the silver-haired man.
"Speaking of which..." Ozpin continued, as he walked over to another boy, but this boy had quite a noticeable tail sticking out from behind. "Your name, young man?"
"Sun Wukong, sir!" The monkey-tailed boy saluted "I come from the Vacuo District!"
"I see you are a Faunus. Were you, let's say, offended by Mr. Winchester's remarks?"
"No sir!" Sun paused for a short moment. "A little, but, anyway, that's part of the reason why I wanted to join the military! I don't want others' opinions to decide how I should live my life or put me down. I want to be able to follow my own path, forge my own destiny. Let me be the master of my own fate!"
Ozpin smiled, "I admire your self-confidence, but don't forget the importance of teamwork and friendship as well. I'm sure you'll have plenty of comrades here that you'll learn to trust in time." He then walked to another trainee, this time, a girl who had distinguishing rabbit ears, "As for you, miss uh..."
"V-Velvet Scarlatina! S-Sir!" The bunny-eared girl nervously responded as she made her salute. "I-I come from Menagerie Village! I wanted to join because... well, I-I felt this need to help the people that are too scared to fend themselves from the Titans, a-and I want to be s-someone who was strong for them!"
"Another good reason." Ozpin replied. "Don't be afraid, you haven't even faced the most frightening of things yet." At that, Velvet was starting to get a little more nervous, but Ozpin eased her. "You'll be fine, I assure you, I won't let any of you die." With that, Velvet started to calm down a little more.
Ozpin then saw red-haired girl with fierce green eyes, "You look like a strong young woman. Your name?"
"Pyrrha Nikos, sir!" she exclaimed while saluting, "I hail from the Mistral District! I joined the military because it is a duty I swore upon myself to dedicate my life to the protection of humanity!"
"Very good, I believe you'll be an outstanding member of our squad." Ozpin replied.
After walking around, he then noticed the young, dark red haired girl with silver eyes. Immediately, Ozpin was awe-stricken.
Could this be? That girl? The one whom Summer always used to talk about?
Piquing his curiosity, Ozpin walked over to where she was standing. "Young lady, who might you be?"
"Ruby Rose, sir!" The young girl saluted. "I come from Patch Village! I want to join because I want to help people and fight for what is right! Moreover, I wish to explore what is outside the Walls!"
Ozpin, although he listened, decided to make an aloof comment, "You have… silver eyes..."
"Hmm?"
"It's nothing to worry about at the moment. But I've heard quite a few things about you, Ruby."
"Huh? How do you know about me?"
"Well, one thing is that your uncle Qrow and I go a long ways back. The other thing…" at that moment, Ozpin wasn't sure whether or not to mention Summer's name to her, because he might end up upsetting her. "Well, you'll find out another time. I wish I could tell you now, but you're not quite ready to know just yet. Other than that, I see you have quite the amazing potential. You don't know it yet, but it's there."
Ruby was a little disappointed, as she was curious if he knew her mother, but at the same time happy that she is recognized as a capable warrior.
Ozpin then continued his walk among the trainees as they introduce themselves to him
After introductions were done, Ozpin decided to continue on with what he had planned.
"All right, thank you all for taking the time to introduce yourselves to me. I can see there are a lot of you among us that are capable candidates for joining the Beacon Corps. For you are the light of hope - the beacon - for humanity as we face the impending darkness. I'll be discussing with my colleagues on who will be assigned with whom. But for now, get some rest. For your training tomorrow and over the course of this next week will require all your physical stamina, as well as your mental stamina, which will allow you to push beyond your limits and increase your peak ability. Thank you all, and good evening."
With that, Ozpin leaves and the trainees head over to the mess hall for dinner.
The sounds of chatter filled the air in the mess hall, as everyone was sharing stories and enjoying their food.
"Well, he seemed… nice." Yang said as she was eating a loaf of bread. "Although sometimes you wonder if he's ever listening to you at all. I can't tell either if he's disinterested or if it does listen, but doesn't show it. Oh man, now I'm kinda afraid of him if he could be listening to us right now! But I doubt he'd be the kind of person to do that. What do you say, Rubes?"
Ruby wasn't listening to her talkative older sis, and instead was fiddling her food with her fork. Her face was frowning.
"Uh, Ruby? Are you okay?" Yang asked, catching Ruby's attention. "Huh? Oh yeah, I'm okay..."
"What's wrong?"
"Hm? Oh nothing. Just nothing..."
As the surrounding abuzz of the other trainees started to mute out slowly, Ruby couldn't help but think to herself...
Mom…. what happened to you?
Alright, I think I'm gonna end the chapter here. Sorry it took longer for this one to get out! And sorry if this chapter seems a bit half-assed or out of place. I just got done with finals this past week, and my brain is WRACKED. I'm so tired now… As soon as I get all my ideas together again, I'll get to work on the next chapter.
Anyways, hope you enjoyed it! Read and review, criticism is welcome, don't forget to follow and fave for more! I greatly appreciate your support! See ya next time! ^_^
Major news outlets have devoted very little attention to the Wikileaks release of thousands of John Podesta's emails.
The New York Times, allegedly America's “paper of record,” has only written five stories about the leaks. None about Hillary saying Saudi Arabia and Qatar fund ISIS, the state department coordinating with the Clinton campaign, or journalists' coziness with the Clinton campaign. Possibly the reason the Times didn't cover the latter is because two of their writers were exposed in the leaks for their close relationship with the Clinton campaign.
Political writer John Harwood showered Clinton with praise in the emails and even gave her campaign chairman Podesta advice. While New York Times Magazine chief national correspondent Mark Leibovich gave the Clinton campaign veto power over an article he wrote.
The Washington Post had only two stories about the leaks on their front page Tuesday afternoon. But none were about the leaks themselves and just Indiana Gov. Mike Pence's and Podesta's remarks on them. The Washington Post's editorial board even ran a piece titled: “Scandal! WikiLeaks reveals Hillary Clinton to be…reasonable.”
The Washington Post did not cover Clinton allies making fun of someone raising their kid Catholic, Chelsea Clinton seeking an “internal investigation” into the Clinton Foundation, or Hillary having to be told when to smile during speeches. One of their reporters was featured in the leak running her story by Podesta before it was published and admitting to leaving out factual information.
The Los Angeles Times has one story regarding the leaks on their homepage Tuesday night and it is about Podesta accusing Trump allies of being behind the leaks. The liberal paper is light on their coverage of the leaks and one of their few stories is about Clinton's press secretary Brain Fallon attacking the leak.
Fallon told Wikileaks on Twitter Tuesday, “You are no media organization. You are a propaganda arm of the Russian govt, running interference for their pet candidate, Trump.”
“Russia actively trying to boost Trump is way more important than how our campaign's tweets are crafted, but is getting fraction of coverage,” Fallon wrote in another tweet. The Clinton campaign was quick to condemn reporters covering the leaks as they claim the Russian government is behind them.
In another tweet, Fallon wrote, “If you are going to write about materials issued by [Wikileaks], you should at least state they are product of illegal hack by a foreign govt.”
The United States government has not definitively accused Russia of being behind Wikileaks.
Buzzfeed has also been light on their coverage of the damning leaks, and have only written three stories regarding them. When asked by The Daily Caller about their lack of coverage, editor-in-chief Ben Smith pointed TheDC to sociologist Zeynep Tufekci's tweets regarding the leak. In one tweet she wrote, “Forget leak tidbits. Normalizing making a big deal of non-scandal, merely private stuff will end up destructive—whatever politics you hold.”
The New York Times' Nick Confessore seems to hold a similar view to Tufekci, as he tweeted out, “News orgs have decided to report Podesta e-mails as newsworthy. But what's the right standard in an era of potentially pervasive hacking?”
CNN correspondent Sara Sidner played the blame game on Tuesday, telling Jake Tapper that leftists wouldn't have to get violent if their political opponents would just stay home.
Sidner was responding to President Trump's press conference where he squarely placed blame on both the alt-right and the alt-left for inciting violence. Though she did admit that Antifa is at least partially responsible for escalating the demonstration, she vociferously defended their tactics and chastised the other side for exercising their First Amendment rights to peacefully assemble:
“Okay, so, here's the truth. The Antifa — there's a group of anti-fascists called the Black Bloc who do tend to get violent. Their idea is, look, non-violence hasn't worked and we are going to try and stop this. But they wouldn't have been there — they wouldn't have been anywhere near there — had it not been for the fact that white supremacists, neo-Nazis were out scaring the living daylights out of most of the people in that town.”
Sidner said that the president is emboldening white supremacists to become even more violent and emphasized how minorities are “literally terrified” that they will become the next victims.
To emphasize her point, Sidner read former klansman David Duke's tweet after Trump's presser saying white supremacists are “getting the message.” Duke thanked the president for having the courage to call out the violence coming from the Left. You may not like the messenger, but the truth needs to be acknowledged.
Watch below:
The Washington Free Beacon's Alex Griswold asked, “By that logic, where does Ms. Sidner believe that Nazis should congregate that wouldn't justify attacking them?”
Isn't that like saying a woman wouldn't have been raped if she didn't dress that way? Isn't victim blaming frowned upon by the Left?
If anything, the media and other leftists are inconsistent, to say the least. Who could forget the The New York Times blaming conservatives for making the Left turn violent against them on college campuses:

Love, Thy Name is Bacon…
This was my first time trying Blue Moon Diner's Annual Bacon Lover's Menu on Valentine's Day. And to hell with my cardiologist, I'm planning to do it again next year.
We started off with the bacon bloody mary. The horseradish overshadowed the bacon by a long stretch, but whatever the olives were stuffed with was a hit at the table. I admit I hadn't noticed the BLT Martini on the menu and I think I may have preferred that. I'm planning to try it when it reappears on their menu during the summer months.
The first course was a little vague on the menu, but the plate contained spicy batter dipped deep fried bacon with a creamy spicy dipping sauce on the side. I think the delectability of the subsequent courses made this one less impressive. It wasn't bad, but the bacon was somewhat lost in the breading and the sauce.
The next course was a smoky bacon-wrapped mozzarella served on a bed of arugula, with a light dressing that complimented the peppery lettuce really well. The smoky cheese and bacon creation was amazing. My biggest complaint was that we only got one of these delights atop the salad.
The third course was a bacon potato pancake with baked apple slices and maple syrup drizzled on top. I wound up eating the apples and syrup separately from the latke. It was delicious that way, but I'm not sure how it would have worked with a forkful of everything in one bite. These pancakes, however, quickly shot to the top of my favorite ways to enjoy a potato.
The shrimp wrapped in bacon were huge and scrumptious, but the tomato sauce had too much of a kick for my tastes. A bite of a tomato chunk from the sauce sent me to immediately drain my water glass. One of my dining compatriots loved it. The rest of us were brought bread and full water glasses from the attentive staff.
One of my friends had complained that he was still hungry after the meal but the rest of us were satisfied. I took my bacon brownie home for later, where I discovered two things: First, you can't effectively sneak a bacon-topped brownie past the dog, and, second, as far as midnight snacks are concerned, Blue Moon's dense fudgey brownie topped with bacon crumbles is pretty close to heaven on a plate.
Tonight Sturgill Simpson made his ‘SNL' debut, due in large part to a surprise Grammy nomination for Album Of The Year. His 2016 album A Sailor's Guide To Earth came out back in April of last year, but when the Grammys nominated it for their most coveted award, heads began to turn. Earlier he kicked things off with a fiery and rambunctious performance of “Keep It Between The Lines,” and now he's closed out his debut appearance with a rendition of “Call To Arms,” the final song off his new record, and a pointed critique of US military action and mindsets.
Given the album is a tribute to his son, and an instruction manual of sorts, this statement is both political and personal. It's advice to his son, but also a scathing critique of the way American propaganda surrounding military action abroad currently works. The band absolutely howls through the performance, and Simpson ends it the only way a song this spirited could conclude — by smashing his guitar.
Mbombela - A former South African National Defence Force (SANDF) soldier's failure to convince a court that he trespassed in the Kruger National Park in order to look for muthi, will see him spending the next 26 years in prison.
The former soldier, Leonard Bhuti Mashego, 56, from Pienaar Trust outside Mbombela, was sentenced - together with his co-accused, Michael Sithole, 53, a herbalist from Clau Clau Trust.
The two heard their fate in the Nelspruit Regional Court late on Wednesday afternoon.
They were arrested after a shootout involving rangers in the Bristol area of the Kruger Park on September 25, 2010.
They faced 23 counts, among them killing and dehorning six rhinos, illegal activities in the game reserve, carrying out a restricted activity involving a threatened species, possession of an illegal firearm and ammunition, and failing to report a stolen firearm.
Sithole's defence, that he went into the park to search for his stray cows, also failed to save him from going to prison.
"On evidence from the rangers, there was a hole on the fence which you (Mashego) used as an entrance. No one among these witnesses tried to mislead the court or to implicate you. You said you were called from outside to come towards the fence and got arrested, which is a lie.
"Another witness also stated that you even got stuck on the hole on the fence. There is serious doubt you were digging for muthi in the park in the middle of the night. All evidence indicated that you were there to hunt for rhino and a hunting rifle was found next to you,”"said Magistrate André Geldenhuys.
Geldenhuys said Mashego also tried misleading the court that he was in the park that night only to look for two of his cows that went missing.
"The court cannot accept your evidence that you lost two cows. It is questionable that you walked in the middle of the night, until you entered the park, only to look after cattle. On evidence by the state, a rhino horn was found in your possession. You even admitted to one of the witnesses after you were shot on your shoulder by rangers that you entered the park to hunt for rhino," said Geldenhuys.
The magistrate said Mashego, who was on suspension without pay from the SANDF since his arrest in September 2010, failed to explain to the court about dates showing that he was absent from work.
"You were suspended from work because of this incident... There is no doubt that on September 22, you were together in the park. You entered without a permit and the modus operandi employed during the commission of the crime is same as of September 25," he said.
During mitigation before sentencing, Advocate Daniel Mabunda and Advocate Klaas Khoza asked the court to have mercy and hand their clients suspended sentences.
However, State prosecutor Advocate Isabet Erwee said the sentences should fit to the crimes committed, as the number of rhino killed is on the increase despite efforts to save them.
"The operation was well planned. Firearms and ammunition were organised and Accused 2 wore his SANDF uniform and an army bag was used in carrying the horns," said Erwee.
She said it was obvious the two were brutal in the manner they shot at the animals.
"They fired their rifles multiple times, with little regard of what happened to the animals. As a result of the continuous poaching, security and patrols have been increased in the parks in order to hear the shootings from a distance. It is a costly operation," said Erwee.
Geldenhuys said, despite the fact that Mashego had a license for the .303 hunting rifle found in his possession, he also faced charges of illegal possession of a firearm relating to the one found on Sithole as they both acted together with common purpose.
The magistrate acquitted them on counts 14 to 23 due to lack of evidence. He found them guilty on 13 charges and sentenced them each to 26 years in prison.

Peering through a giant cosmic magnifying glass, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has spotted one of the farthest, faintest, and smallest galaxies ever seen. The diminutive object is estimated to be over 13 billion light-years away.
This new detection is considered one of the most reliable distance measurements of a galaxy that existed in the early universe, said the Hubble researchers. They used two independent methods to estimate its distance.
The galaxy appears as a tiny blob that is only a small fraction of the size of our Milky Way galaxy. But it offers a peek back into a time when the universe was only about 500 million years old, roughly 3 percent of its current age of 13.7 billion years. Astronomers have uncovered about 10 other galaxy candidates at this early era. But this newly found galaxy is significantly smaller and fainter than most of those other remote objects detected to date.
"This object is a unique example of what is suspected to be an abundant, underlying population of extremely small and faint galaxies at about 500 million years after the big bang," explained study leader Adi Zitrin of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. "The discovery is telling us that galaxies as faint as this one exist, and we should continue looking for them and even fainter objects so that we can understand how galaxies and the universe have evolved over time."
The galaxy was detected as part of the Frontier Fields program, an ambitious three-year effort, begun in 2013, that teams Hubble with NASA's other Great Observatories -- the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory -- to probe the early universe by studying large galaxy clusters. These clusters are so massive that their gravity deflects light passing through them, magnifying, brightening, and distorting background objects in a phenomenon called gravitational lensing. These powerful lenses allow astronomers to find many dim, distant structures that otherwise might be too faint to see.
In this new discovery, the lensing power of the mammoth galaxy cluster Abell 2744, nicknamed Pandora's Cluster, produced three magnified images of the same galaxy. Each magnified image makes the galaxy appear as much as 10 times larger and brighter than it would look without the intervening lens.
An analysis of the distant galaxy shows that it measures merely 850 light-years across, 500 times smaller than the Milky Way, and is estimated to have a mass of only 40 million suns. The galaxy's star formation rate is about one star every three years (one-third the star formation rate in the Milky Way). Although this may seem low, Zitrin said that given its small size and low mass, the tiny galaxy is in fact rapidly evolving and efficiently forming stars.
"Galaxies such as this one are probably small clumps of matter that are starting to form stars and shine light, but they don't have a defined structure yet," Zitrin said. "Therefore, it's possible that we only see one bright clump magnified due to the lensing, and this is one possibility as to why it is smaller than typical field galaxies of that time." Zitrin's team spotted the galaxy's gravitationally multiplied images using near-infrared and visible-light photos of the galaxy cluster taken by Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 and Advanced Camera for Surveys. But at first they didn't know how far away it was from Earth.
Normally, astronomers use spectroscopy to determine an object's distance. The farther away a galaxy, the more its light has been stretched by the universe's expansion. Astronomers can precisely measure this effect through spectroscopy, which characterizes an object's light.
But the gravitationally lensed galaxy and other objects found at this early epoch are too far away and too dim for astronomers to use spectroscopy. Astronomers instead analyze an object's color to estimate its distance. The universe's expansion reddens an object's color in predictable ways, which scientists can measure.
Members of Zitrin's team not only performed the color-analysis technique, but they also took advantage of the multiple images produced by the gravitational lens to independently confirm their distance estimate. The astronomers measured the angular separation between the three magnified images of the galaxy in the Hubble photos. The greater the angular separation due to lensing, the farther away the object is from Earth. To test this concept, the astronomers compared the three magnified images with the locations of several other multiply imaged objects lensed by Abell 2744 that are not as far behind the cluster. The angular distance between the magnified images of the closer galaxies was smaller.
"These measurements imply that, given the large angular separation between the three images of our background galaxy, the object must lie very far away," Zitrin explained. "It also matches the distance estimate we calculated, based on the color-analysis technique. So we are about 95 percent confident that this object is at a remote distance, at redshift 10 (a measure of the stretching of space since the big bang). The lensing takes away any doubt that this might be a heavily reddened, nearby object masquerading as a far more distant object."
Astronomers have long debated whether such early galaxies could have provided enough radiation to warm the hydrogen that cooled soon after the big bang. This process, called "reionization," is thought to have occurred 200 million to 1 billion years after the birth of the universe. Reionization made the universe transparent to light, allowing astronomers to look far back into time without running into a "fog" of cold hydrogen.
"We tend to assume that galaxies ionized the universe with their ultraviolet light," Zitrin said. "But we do not see enough galaxies or light that could do that. So we need to look at fainter and fainter galaxies, and the Frontier Fields and galaxy cluster lensing can help us achieve this goal."
MTA NYC Transit has just announced the FASTRACK schedule for the 1st Q of 2017. Here are the details:
MTA New York City Transit's FASTRACK program returns with the first FASTRACK of the year along the 4, 5, 6 lines between Midtown Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn for two weeks.
For four consecutive weeknights from Monday, January 23, to early Friday morning, January 27, and for four weeknights from Monday, January 30 to Friday, February 3, 4, 5, 6 trains will not run between Grand Central-42 St and Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr. 4 trains will run local between Woodlawn and Grand Central-42 St. Overnight 3 service is extended to Brooklyn, and makes all 4 line station stops between Borough Hall and New Lots Av. 5 service in Manhattan will end early each night. 6 service will operate between Pelham Bay Park and Grand Central-42 St.
Travel alternatives:
• For service to/from Lower Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn, use the R & W before 11:30 p.m. and the N & R after 11:30 p.m.
• Transfer between N, R, W & 4 & 6 trains at Lexington Av-59 St.
• Transfer between N, Q, R, W, 7 and 2, 3 and S trains at Times Sq-42 St. The 42 St S Shuttle will operate overnight.
• Transfer between D, N, Q, R and 2 & 3 trains at the Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr.
FASTRACK has been designed around the careful determination that there is adequate alternate means of transportation, including enhanced services along some bus lines during work periods. Alternative transportation options will be detailed in announcements and posters on trains, in stations and on selected buses; brochures will be available in both English and Spanish. Information on this FASTRACK is available on the web at http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/fastrack_456.htm
Wynton Habersham, Senior Vice President for the Department of Subways said “FASTRACK has proven to have a significant impact on decreasing delays, both in terms of consolidating maintenance forces in a concentrated area and in terms of proactive maintenance that improves service delivery.”
FASTRACK was introduced in January 2012, devoting four straight weeknights to perform maintenance work in tunnels, stations and on tracks, completely suspending service within a given line segment for a seven-hour period between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m..
This gives free access to the system, allowing an army of maintenance workers to perform dozens of tasks repairing and replacing components that are vital to providing safe and reliable train service without the concern of having to “clear up” to allow trains to pass. FASTRACK efforts have been highly successful in providing a safer work environment for employees and improved station conditions for customers.
During our previous FASTRACK along this portion of the 4, 5, 6 in February 2016, subway service was suspended along the Lexington Avenue Line between Grand Central-42 St and Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr each night while NYC Transit employees performed a range of cleaning and maintenance tasks of station and tunnel infrastructure, signal equipment, and track and third rail components.
Track workers scraped and cleaned 27,120 feet of track. Replaced 55 rails, 1,717 track plates, 10 tie blocks, 1,773 friction pads, and cleaned 7,010 feet of track under and around the third rail. Infrastructure crews cleaned 2,050 feet of “No Clearance” signs, removed 229 gallons of silt, cleaned 1,473 feet of drains, performed pump plant maintenance, changed 232 tunnel light bulbs, and replaced 130 handrails.
At stations, workers repaired 228 feet of rubbing board at the platform's edge, scraped 36,170 square feet of paintable station surfaces and painted 102,625 square feet of station surfaces, including 86 columns, and 58 stairway safety features. Station lighting improvements included changing 501 station light bulbs and cleaning 195 fixtures. Signal crews serviced 11 switches and 87 signals. In the area of electronic maintenance, workers serviced 66 CCTV cameras and 62 CCTV monitors including 3 CCTV lenses. This only represents a portion of the work that is completed during FASTRACK.
During the first quarter of 2017, FASTRACK projects are scheduled for:
• January 23 to 27, and January 30 to February 3 on the 4, 5, 6 Lines between Manhattan and Brooklyn. No 4, 5, 6 trains between Grand Central-42 St and Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr in both directions.
• February 6 to 10, and February 13 to 17 on the B, D, F, M Lines in Manhattan.B, D, F, M trains will not stop at 14 St, 23 St, 34 St, 42 St, 47-50 Sts, and 57 St.
• February 27 to March 3, and March 6 to March 10 on the B, D lines in the Bronx. No D trains between Norwood-205 St and 161 St-Yankee Stadium in both directions. B service will end early each weeknight.
• April 3 to 7, and April 10 to 14 on the L. No L trains between Lorimer St and Broadway Junction.
So, you've found out that you can borrow from your 401k and you're ready to call your company's 401k manager and request the maximum amount. After all, it's your money and you need it now. Your human resources page tells you it's simple to request and you're paying yourself back with interest so what's the harm?
Slow down. It's not necessarily a bad thing to borrow from your 401k, depending on the reason you need the money. However, you need to know the 401k loan rules before you take out a loan, just as you would need to know the terms of any loan from any institution.
Yes, you are paying yourself back, but in the meantime, the money you have borrowed will not be growing, which is necessary for retirement. So, before you fill out that loan application, make sure you know exactly what you are getting yourself into.
What Are the 401k Loan Rules?
As with any loan, you have to abide by specific terms or you could end up defaulting on the money you owe, giving you more headaches than you had before you borrowed it. Getting more money is supposed to make your life easier and knowing the 401k loan rules before you accept any money will do that. Keep in mind that most financial planners and retirement experts do not recommend that you take out a 401k loan at all. However, if you're going to go ahead and do it, at least know the rules.
1. There are limits on how much you can borrow. You are limited to a $50,000 loan or half of your balance, whichever is less. You must also agree to start repaying yourself with your very next paycheck, which is accomplished through an automatic deduction.
2. You have to pay the loan back within a certain time frame. Typically, you will be required to pay yourself back within five years from the date you take out the loan. If you are using the money to buy a house, however, the length of the loan could be longer. You will need to contact your 401k manager to find out how long you can take to pay the loan off in a case like this.
3. No credit check is required. This is one of the best parts about the 401k loan rules. You can get it no matter what your credit looks like. You are loaning the money to yourself, so you're the only one accepting the risk of default.
4. You must pay interest on the loan. Just as you would with any loan from a traditional institution, you will need to pay interest. The good part, though, is that with a 401k loan, you are paying the interest to yourself.
5. There will be no application fees. Since you aren't going to be denied the loan for any reason, there is no need to charge an application fee.
6. Any money you borrow cannot be invested for your retirement as long as the loan is outstanding. This is probably the biggest drawback to having a loan from your 401k since the purpose of a 401k is to save for retirement. You are essentially robbing yourself of some of your retirement funds when you take out a loan, even if only for a short time.
7. Your loan must be paid back using after-tax dollars. This means that your take-home pay is reduced by the full amount of your loan payment. Even worse is that when you withdraw the funds again later for retirement, you'll have to pay taxes on it again.
8. If you leave your employer before you repay your loan, you will be required to pay the full amount within 60 days. If you do not pay it back, then you will have to pay an early-withdrawal penalty and federal and state income tax on the portion you borrowed.
Is a 401k Loan Really Worth It?
This is definitely an important question that you need to consider carefully before taking out a 401k loan. The 401k loan rules are restrictive for a reason. You are supposed to be using the money for your retirement. If the money was easy to access without penalties, no one would leave any money in their accounts for their golden years.
There are definitely some reasons when a 401k loan is an okay alternative. However, unless you are going to go bankrupt without those funds, it is probably best to leave your retirement accounts like your 401k and IRA untouched until you reach retirement age.

Fracking fluid and other drilling wastes sit in an unlined pit in North Belridge, California, July 11, 2014. (Photo: Faces of Fracking)
The question of how to handle the toxic waste from fracking and other oil and gas activities is one of the most intractable issues confronting environmental regulators. Not only because of the sheer volume of waste generated nationwide, but also because some of the radioactive materials involved have a half-life of over 1,500 years, making the consequences of decision-making today especially long-lasting.
Every year, the oil and gas industry generates roughly 21 billion barrels of wastewater and millions of tons of solid waste, much of it carrying a mix of naturally occurring radioactive materials, and some of it bearing so much radioactive material that it is not safe to drink or even, on far more rare occasions, to simply have it near you.
But unlike most other industries, since 1988, the oil and gas industry has benefitted from an exception to national hazardous waste handling laws, which punts control of this radioactive waste from the federal government down to each individual state – no matter how dangerous the waste might be.
Over the past decade, states have often proved ill-prepared to handle the flood of waste from the shale drilling rush, sometimes because drillers struck oil or gas in a region with little prior experience with drilling's unique hazards, and other times because the political sway of a wealthy and well-connected industry or a lack of resources for environmental regulation left state rules vague or poorly enforced, environmentalists say.
Both types of problems are highlighted in a new report, published Nov. 19 by the Western Organization of Resource Councils (WORC), that examines how radioactive wastes are handled under various state laws.
“[S]tate regulatory frameworks remain sparse, where they exist at all,” the report, titled No Time To Waste, concluded, after a review of rules governing radioactive waste from oil and gas operations in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming.
Some of those states, like Wyoming and North Dakota, have long-established histories of intensive oil exploration, while others, like Montana and Idaho have far less drilling activity but nonetheless have found themselves grappling in recent years with radioactive waste from neighboring states and as far away as Pennsylvania.
The report details a string of illegal dumping incidents, including the dumping of thousands of pounds of filter socks, used to filter wastewater, on a truck bed in Watford City in Feb. 2014; a 2013 incident where roughly 1,000 filter socks were illegally snuck into a municipal landfill; and the discovery in March, 2014 of over 200 trash bags stuffed with radioactive waste at an abandoned gas station in Noonan, ND, which made national headlines.
That year, an Associated Press investigation uncovered over 150 attempts to dump radioactive waste at landfills not qualified to accept it – and that state regulators failed to fine or sanction anyone over the attempted illicit dumping.
And that's in North Dakota, which is the only state with a “relatively comprehensive” approach to regulating the drilling rush's radioactive materials, the WORC report concluded.
“Oil and gas companies essentially handle and dispose of radioactive waste at their own discretion,” said Bob LeResche, WORC Chair from Clearmont, Wyoming. “Some have resorted to the cheapest option, illegally dumping it.”
Concerns about corner cutting through illegal waste disposal have grown as oil prices have plunged over the past year.
And while, in theory, lower prices should lead to less drilling, some operators are trying different tactics to deal with the price slump, including continuing to drill wells but waiting to perform the final steps, including fracking, in the hopes of locking in low rig prices and then starting production when prices recover. In North Dakota, for example, over 1,000 oil wells had been drilled but not yet fracked as of September, compared to 13,000 wells producing oil and gas in the state.
Scientists warn that if this radioactive waste is dumped in regular landfills, water running off from the landfills after rainstorms could carry radioactive materials into rivers, streams and drinking water supplies, in part because companies treating wastewater collected from landfills may not know that radioactive materials are present.
Across the U.S., cuttings are finding their ways into these local landfills. “In just the past two years, over 500,000 tons of drill cuttings and shale gas waste products have been buried in the municipal waste landfill in our county,” Bill Hughes, Chairman of the Wetzel County Solid Waste Authority, said earlier this year.
In 1988, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a regulatory determination that, even though the waste from oil and gas exploration and production was toxic, there was no need for the nation's hazardous waste handling laws, under the Resource Recovery and Conservation Act's Subpart C, to apply.
But that notion has increasingly come under fire, not only in Western states, but also in the Northeast.
In August, a coaliton of environmental groups announced their intention to sue the EPA to force it to issue regulations for the industry's toxic and radioactive waste.
“Thirty years ago the Environmental Protection Agency exempted oil and gas waste from federal classification as hazardous, not because the waste isn't hazardous, but because EPA determined state oversight was adequate,” Earthworks' Eastern Program Coordinator Nadia Steinzor, said in a statement when a study detailing the failures to control this waste in the Northeast's Marcellus shale was released earlier this year. “But our analysis shows that states aren't keeping track of this waste or disposing of it properly.”
Similarly, Western states have struggled to keep up with radioactive waste from drilling. “Though North Dakota has occupied much of the spotlight on this issue, other states have begun to see a rising tide of radioactive waste, as well,” the WORC report concluded.
“Among New Western states, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana lack formal regulations, and only Montana has begun to address radioactive oil and gas waste. Idaho has several regulations in place, but no statewide disposal limit. Further east, South Dakota has a radioactivity limit for solid waste disposal, but after that regulations run out,” WORC wrote.
The report criticized the way that Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) calculates whether the industry's waste is dangerous enough to require regulation. “Contrary to the DEQ‘s conclusion, then, Wyoming's TENORM waste products may actually have radioactivity concentrations that are on par with – or even higher than – those of neighboring states, because those wastes are emerging from soils that have higher concentrations already,” the researchers reported.
In Idaho, despite the relatively small presence of the drilling industry, radioactivity is a concern because it's home to one of the nation's largest commercial disposal sites for radioactive waste, including fracking waste. “The facility's limit for radioactivity concentration is 1,500 picocuries per gram of radium – more than 30 times the limit deemed safe by Argonne's North Dakota study,” WORC wrote. “This limit dwarfs the levels accepted in nearby states. As a result, Idaho receives wastes from all over the country, sometimes from as far away as the Pennsylvania shale fields.”
Montana, which similarly has relatively little fracking, has been inundated with waste from neighboring North Dakota's Bakken shale.
“Montana has a radioactivity limit of 30 picocuries per gram, meaning that it can accommodate many of the oilfield wastes that exceed North Dakota's limit of 5 picocuries per gram; as a result, North Dakota generators and waste transporters have quickly flocked to this new facility,” WORC wrote.
North Dakota is in the process of updating its rules for radioactive waste, but while many of the rules under consideration are tougher than existing state laws, the state plans to raise its maximum limits to above Montana's cap, making it 10 times less strict than before the update.
“Without thorough, rigorous, and consistent oversight from the state, especially in the face of a higher radioactivity limit,” Larry Heilmann, a retired biochemist from Fargo, N.D., said in a WORC statement on the report, “it is doubtful that the new rules will result in improvements on the ground.”
Perry Kitchen has found success at Hearts since leaving D.C. United in March.
United States international Perry Kitchen has been named the club captain of Scottish club Hearts for this season.
Kitchen only joined Hearts in March after spending the first five years of his career with D.C. United in MLS, and coach Robbie Neilson said the midfielder has been a natural leader.
"I've been impressed by Perry's attitude, desire and, of course, his performances from day one," Neilson told the club's website.
"He's a natural and leads by example both on and off the park. He's also a really good player and will inspire those around him to reach the highest standards.
"Ideally, we want 11 captains on the pitch every week. In recent times we've had Don Cowie lead the team out and Alim Ozturk skippered us to third place last season, so there's that experience already there that will help us through games.
"I'd like to thank Alim for the huge part he played, and will continue to play, in helping the team to the top end of the league.
"It's now Perry's time to take over that responsibility and I've absolutely no doubt that he will flourish in the role of Hearts captains."
The 24-year-old has made four appearances for Jurgen Klinsmann's United States team since 2015 and made the Copa America squad this past summer.
Christof Koch, a leading researcher on consciousness and the human brain, has famously called the brain “the most complex object in the known universe.” It's not hard to see why this might be true. With a hundred billion neurons and a hundred trillion connections, the brain is a dizzyingly complex object.
But there are plenty of other complicated objects in the universe. For example, galaxies can group into enormous structures (called clusters, superclusters, and filaments) that stretch for hundreds of millions of light-years. The boundary between these structures and neighboring stretches of empty space called cosmic voids can be extremely complex.1 Gravity accelerates matter at these boundaries to speeds of thousands of kilometers per second, creating shock waves and turbulence in intergalactic gases. We have predicted that the void-filament boundary is one of the most complex volumes of the universe, as measured by the number of bits of information it takes to describe it.
This got us to thinking: Is it more complex than the brain?
So we—an astrophysicist and a neuroscientist—joined forces to quantitatively compare the complexity of galaxy networks and neuronal networks. The first results from our comparison are truly surprising: Not only are the complexities of the brain and cosmic web actually similar, but so are their structures. The universe may be self-similar across scales that differ in size by a factor of a billion billion billion.
The task of comparing brains and clusters of galaxies is a difficult one. For one thing it requires dealing with data obtained in drastically different ways: telescopes and numerical simulations on the one hand, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and functional magnetic resonance on the other.
It also requires us to consider enormously different scales: The entirety of the cosmic web—the large-scale structure traced out by all of the universe's galaxies—extends over at least a few tens of billions of light-years. This is 27 orders of magnitude larger than the human brain. Plus, one of these galaxies is home to billions of actual brains. If the cosmic web is at least as complex as any of its constituent parts, we might naively conclude that it must be at least as complex as the brain.
The total number of neurons in the human brain falls in the same ballpark of the number of galaxies in the observable universe.
But the concept of emergence makes the comparison possible. Many natural phenomena are not equally complex at all scales. The majestic network of the cosmic web becomes evident only when the sky is surveyed over its largest extent. On smaller scales, with matter locked into stars, planets, and (probably) dark matter clouds, this structure is lost. An evolving galaxy does not care about the dance of electron orbitals within atoms, and electrons move around their nuclei without regard to the galactic system they reside in.
In this way, the universe contains many systems nested into systems, with little to no interaction across different scales. This scale segregation allows us to study physical phenomena as they emerge at their own natural scales.

The building blocks of the cosmic web are the self-gravitating halos of stars, gas, and dark matter (whose existence has yet to be definitively proved). In total, the number of galaxies within the observable universe should be on the order of 100 billion. The balance between the accelerating expansion of the fabric of spacetime and the pull of self-gravity gives this network its spider-web-like pattern. Ordinary and dark matter condense into string-like filaments, and clusters of galaxies form at filament intersections, leaving most of the remaining volume basically empty. The resulting structure looks vaguely biological.
A direct estimate of the number of cells or neurons in the human brain was not available in the literature until recently. Cortical gray matter (representing over 80 percent of brain mass) contains about 6 billions neurons (19 percent of brain neurons) and nearly 9 billion non-neuronal cells. The cerebellum has about 69 billion neurons (80.2 percent of brain neurons) and about 16 billion non-neuronal cells. Interestingly enough, the total number of neurons in the human brain falls in the same ballpark of the number of galaxies in the observable universe.
The eye immediately grasps some similarity between images of the cosmic web and the brain. In Figure 1 we show a simulated distribution of cosmic matter in a slice 1 billion light-years across, along with a real image of 4 micrometers (µm)-thick slice through the human cerebellum.

Is the apparent similarity just the human tendency to perceive meaningful patterns in random data (apophenia)? Remarkably enough, the answer seems to be no: Statistical analysis shows these systems do indeed present quantitative similarities. Researchers regularly use a technique called power spectrum analysis to study the large-scale distribution of galaxies. The power spectrum of an image measures the strength of structural fluctuations belonging to a specific spatial scale. In other words, it tells us how many high-frequency and low-frequency notes make the peculiar spatial melody of each image.
A stunning message emerges from the power spectrum graph in Figure 2 (below): The relative distribution of fluctuations in the two networks is remarkably similar, over several orders of magnitude.
An evolving galaxy does not care about the dance of electron orbitals within atoms.
The distribution of fluctuations in the cerebellum at 0.1-1 mm scales is reminiscent of the galaxy distribution on hundreds of billions of light-years. At the smallest scales available to microscopic observation (about 10 µm), it is the morphology of the cortex that more closely matches the one of galaxies, on scales of a few hundreds of thousands of light-years.
By comparison, the power spectra of other complex systems (including projected images of clouds, tree branches, and plasma and water turbulence) are quite dissimilar from that of the cosmic web. The power spectra of these other systems display a steeper dependence on scale, which may be a manifestation of their fractal nature. This is particularly striking for the distribution of branches in trees and in the pattern of clouds, both of which are well known for being fractal-like systems with self-similarity across a large variety of scales. For the complex networks of the cosmic web and of the human brain, on the other hand, the observed behavior is not fractal, which can be interpreted as evidence of the emergence of scale-dependent, self-organized structures.
As remarkable as the power spectrum comparison is, it doesn't tell us whether the two systems are equally complex. A practical way of estimating the complexity of a network is to measure how difficult it is to predict its behavior. This can be quantified by counting how many bits of information are necessary for building the smallest possible computer program that can perform such a prediction.
fingerprints (figure 2): Distribution of fluctuations as a function of spatial scale for the same maps of Fig 1 (with the additional analysis of a thin slice through the human cortex, not shown in Fig 1). For comparison, the power spectral density of clouds, tree branches, and plasma and water turbulence are shown.
One of us has recently measured how difficult it is to predict how the cosmic network evolves, based on the digital evolution of a simulated universe.1 This estimate suggests that about 1 to 10 petabytes of data are needed to describe the evolution of the entire observable universe at the scale where its self-organization emerges (or at least of its simulated counterpart).
Estimating the complexity of the human brain is much more difficult, because global simulations of the brain remain an unmet challenge. However, we can argue that complexity is proportional to intelligence and cognition. Based on the latest analysis of the connectivity of the brain network, independent studies have concluded that the total memory capacity of the adult human brain should be around 2.5 petabytes, not far from the 1-10 petabyte range estimated for the cosmic web!
Roughly speaking, this similarity in memory capacity means that the entire body of information that is stored in a human brain (for instance, the entire life experience of a person) can also be encoded into the distribution of galaxies in our universe. Or, conversely, that a computing device with the memory capacity of the human brain can reproduce the complexity displayed by the universe at its largest scales.
It is truly a remarkable fact that the cosmic web is more similar to the human brain than it is to the interior of a galaxy; or that the neuronal network is more similar to the cosmic web than it is to the interior of a neuronal body. Despite extraordinary differences in substrate, physical mechanisms, and size, the human neuronal network and the cosmic web of galaxies, when considered with the tools of information theory, are strikingly similar.
Does this fact tell us something profound about the physics of emergent phenomena in the two systems? Maybe. But we must take these findings with a grain of salt. Our analysis has been limited to small samples taken with very different measurement techniques.
Also, our analysis doesn't point to a dynamical similarity among these systems. A model of how information flows across spatial scales and time in the two systems will be the crucial test. This is already feasible for the cosmic web through numerical simulations. For the human brain we have to rely on more global estimates, usually derived from smaller portions that are then scaled upward. In the near future we aim at testing these concepts in more sophisticated numerical models of the human brain.
Programs like the Human Brain Project, designed to simulate an entire human neuronal network, and the Square Kilometer Array, the biggest enterprise ever in radio astronomy, will help us fill in some of these details and understand whether the universe is even more surprising than we thought.

Airbnb argues that the inappropriate response stemmed largely from a policy conflict. The firm always wants to report crimes in progress, but it also wants sexual assault victims to report attacks when they're comfortable with the idea. In this situation, an indirect call was bound to create a problem -- especially when the mother called a second time to report the assault after the fact. From now on, an in-progress emergency always takes priority.
The company says that it "can learn a lot" from what happened and vows to do better. While that's likely going to happen, the assault underscores how Airbnb's safeguards are minimal compared to the conventional hospitality business. Many hotels not only have dedicated security teams, but will send security to check on guests the moment someone reports a concern. Even with the smarter policy in place, there's only so much services like Airbnb can do if things go horribly awry.

With any travel you have to be flexible to allow for unseen events. Weather delays, canceled tours, lost or stolen items, broken electronics. These are inevitable. I suppose I should have known that something major was coming up since I had a basically flawless trip so far.
I have to admit now, that I am safe and sound, that I have been posting information purposefully late. I left France back on September 10th, though it saddened me to do so. The 4 weeks I was in France were wonderful, safe for the unnerved feeling I had while there. Here is the explanation of why.
As you recall from my previous blogs, I traveled from Dublin, Ireland to Paris, France on a series of buses and ferries. The whole adventure took basically 36 hours, hostel to hostel, with around 20 hours of bus riding.
Well I left out one important detail of that trip. At some point in that progression of miles, an unknown person managed to slip a hand written note into one of the pockets of my jacket. The note, written in a left slanting hand, had poor penmanship, grammatical and spelling errors, and the words themselves had the air of someone writing in a language not their own. It was on a small piece of plain lined paper, was unsigned and had very few identifying features to it.
I will give you the bulk of the text included in the note, however, I must leave out a few lines, for reasons I will explain later.
“Mr. Rettke
We have enjoyed reading your travel entries. it is time for you to go home now.
You can continue your little adventure some other time.
we will contact you when.
Go teach the children in Villdieu Poeles your english and then be gone.
Do not go to the embassy or contact any police. Do not publicize this letter.
We are watching.
when you are home and out of our way you may contact the police and publicize this.
Don' make us contact you again. “
(Grammatical, spelling and punctuation errors left in on purpose)
I sat in my hostel in the heart of the city of love re-reading this note over and over. I had no clue who would have done this, or why. My friends back home, while suspect, wouldn't have gone to this length, and even had they, finding a 5'3″ wild haired man in the sprawl that is Paris or Dublin, would not be easy. While I made the mistake of posting my basic plans of travel ahead of time, I did not leave specific information as to how I was getting there, the times of travel, the places I was visiting or when. Someone would have had to follow me quite closely to get the chance to accomplish this goal as well.
I also would point out that while I was not as secure as I could have been, I do have a certain amount of wherewithal about me when I am lugging my backpack and guitar around because I know it makes me a slow moving, easy target for pick pockets and muggers. I am not as naive as I may appear, what with the “hippy hair” and kind face. I must point out to my audience that might not realize, but I worked as a police dispatcher before I left. I've seen and heard quite a bit and learned enough about random criminal acts and what not to have a pretty solid head about myself.
I will also point out that the coat which had the note slipped into it, while it does have 37 pockets to choose from, it was on my body or balled up under my seat the entire time I was traveling. Who ever managed this feat was close. Too close for my comfort.
While the note, as you can read above, is not overly dramatic or threatening, it was mysterious in many ways. The use of the word we. Who are we? The handwriting is highly cramped, slanted and forced looking. To me it reads as someone who may have not been used to our alphabet (the Latin letters), and that it was written right to left. The syntax was also not what sounded like a natural English speaker either, as you can see above. “Go teach the children in Villedieu Poeles your english and then be gone.” is formed very strangely to my ear, but I have been pouring over all these words for weeks so maybe I am just over analyzing it.
In any event, I discussed this note issue with my family and a friend of mine back home, I decided to take then note seriously. I went to Villdieu for a few weeks, then rushed back to Paris and flew back to the states in mid September. I stayed south with family for a spell debating my next move. I decided, that since most of my funds had been exhausted getting back to the States on such short notice, I would need to return home for at least a year to restock my travel fund, so I started planning my return to Alaska. The summer was over, so there no point in rushing home, so I decided that coming back at Halloween time would be better, and could be more fun.
My friend I had talked to and I planned out a little trick to play on my friends back home. I returned on a Friday evening, and the next day most of our friends would be at a Halloween party. In fact most of them would be in the band that was playing. The band I used to be in before I left, and that still bares, in part, my name. (Minus Ty'd – Check out their Facebook page!) We found a picture of me before I left, and printed off a bunch of card stock masks that we cut out and put on paint stirring sticks for people to walk around with. We got a few pictures of the band wearing them and people had a great time, as the band explained who I was and what not.
Now I, being back in the states for several weeks leading up to this, had time to plan. I purchased a unicorn head mask just for this occasion. I came into the party later in the evening wearing this mask, and an inflatable “fat ballerina” outfit. It uses a battery pack and small fan to blow it up, but is made of fabric so it breaths very well. It made for a great costume, people enjoyed seeing it very much.
I sat at the back of the room while people milled around, took pictures with me (Not knowing who I was yet) and had a good time. Then came the costume contest. I went up and paraded around. Unfortunately I did not win, however, at the end of the winners announcements, my friend went up and stole the mic. He called for attention and said that there was an imposter among us. He then called for the unicorn to come up.
I was facing the band as he talked for a moment, though I couldn't hear it all because of the noise and the mask I was wearing. Then, while everyone was watching, he reached over and ripped off the unicorn mask. After a few seconds the realization set in and a great roar went up. I was practically tackled by the band members and there was much hugging and laughing and good times.
I decided to be mum on the reason to my return at the time and instead enjoy the night surprising old friends. Having a unicorn mask helps with this. We wandered the night life circuit doing a similar spiel.
So now I am back in town, my travels temporarily put on hold. I do not know for how long, or exactly where I will start again. I await a response from who ever put the note in my pocket, and have left out several identifying items from it in this narrative to be able to confirm if someone is the author should they contact me again, which should prevent hoaxers, I hope. This is also why I have not posted a picture of the note.
I will continue to post here, and hope to do some traveling state side, as well as other projects to fill my time, and refund my travel bank, so please do keep in touch. If you have any questions regarding this or any of my travels please feel free to contact me using the contact form HERE.
Thank you, as always, and safe travels!

Image caption This group of former Taliban fighters pledged allegiance to IS in Pakistan last month
A drone strike in Afghanistan has killed a militant commander who recently swore allegiance to Islamic State (IS), officials say.
The police chief of Helmand said that former Taliban commander Mullah Abdul Rauf had died in the Nato strike.
It emerged last month that Rauf had sworn allegiance to IS after falling out with the Taliban.
Tribal elders in northern Helmand say a car carrying up to six people was destroyed while crossing the desert.
The car was loaded with ammunition and exploded, reports said.
Analysis: BBC's David Loyn, Kabul
Analysts are divided over whether those flying black flags in Afghanistan are opportunists or are directed by the IS leadership in Syria and Iraq.
The commander killed in Helmand, Mullah Abdul Rauf, was appointed deputy commander in the region some weeks after he first declared his allegiance when he split from the Taliban.
The air strike that killed him was one of the first reported under Nato's new mandate.
There have been increasing reports of people supporting IS from across the country. Afghan government spokesmen continue to insist that they are disaffected Taliban, and not a significant new development.
One disturbing aspect is that the name used by IS in Syria to describe the offshoot here is the Khorasan group, using an old name for Afghanistan.
And there is an ancient myth that black flags will fly again in Khorasan shortly before the end of the world.
The Afghan Intelligence Agency also said Rauf had been killed. Nato confirmed the air strike, but not the intended target.
Afghan forces say it has been very hard to call in air strikes under the new Nato mandate since the beginning of this year. This was one of the first strikes to be approved.
The militant commander's brother-in-law and four Pakistanis were also killed in the attack, Helmand police chief Nabi Jan Mullahkhel was quoted by Reuters as saying.
Islamic State controls swathes of Syria and Iraq and has a small but growing presence in parts of Afghanistan.
Correspondents say it poses the first serious challenge to the coherence of the Taliban leadership for many years.
Where else is Islamic State active?
Egypt: Based in Sinai, the IS branch was essentially a re-branding of Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, which first emerged in 2011 in the wake of the Egyptian revolution.
Libya: Three distinct Libyan IS "provinces" were announced in November - Barqah in the east, Tripoli in the west and Fazzan in the south.
Algeria: A breakaway group from al-Qaeda's North Africa branch (AQIM), the IS branch rose to prominence in September when it beheaded French tourist Herve Gourdel. Since then it has been largely silent.
Yemen and Saudi Arabia: The new branches have not claimed any activities yet but the move represents a symbolic challenge to al-Qaeda.
Afghanistan-Pakistan: IS says its branch here represents the historic Khorasan Province - a region covering Afghanistan, Pakistan and "other nearby lands".
Islamic State builds on al-Qaeda lands
Rauf, who spent six years in Guantanamo Bay after being captured by US forces in 2001, was reported to have fallen out with the leader of the Taliban, Mullah Omar.
He swapped the white flags of the Taliban for the black flags of IS and recruited followers in Helmand.
Rauf was then named as deputy leader of IS in "Khorasan" - an old name for Afghanistan - by the organisation in Syria.
The most senior IS commander for the region is Saeed Khan, who is based in Orakzai tribal agency in Pakistan.
Correction 13 February: A picture appeared in this article which was captioned as Mullah Abdul Rauf. We no longer believe that this was Rauf and have removed it. We apologise for any distress caused by the photograph, which was supplied to the BBC by the Afghan National Directorate of Security.
The Youngest Casualties in the War on Obesity. Recently PS Mag posted an article called “” It opens with the story of Jaime, a 11 year old who developed an eating disorder after she her school publicly measured and announced her BMI, and she decided that lowering her BMI might make her more popular.
“I don't think she even knew what a BMI was before that,” her mother says. But as soon as she did know, it was all Jane could think about… By the time she graduated from high school, Jane had been hospitalized three times for her eating disorder and attended three separate eating disorder programs, sometimes thousands of miles away from her family… “I don't believe that the public school weigh-in and BMI screening caused her eating disorder, but rather they were significant factors, among others, which triggered her illness,” she says.
The piece continues:
No one doubts that these policies are well-intentioned. It's impossible not to want children to grow up healthy and happy. And the current data says that, for many children, this isn't happening. Most children don't eat the recommended five servings of fruits and vegetables, nor do they play vigorously for an hour a day. Since children spend much of their day at school, it seemed logical to intervene there.
Stop the logic train, we had a bunch of people fall off. Research say that most kids don't eat the recommended amount of fruits and vegetable or get enough activity. So schools decided to weigh them publicly and focus on body size as a proxy for health with no evidence to back up their approach.
What with the who now? If kids aren't getting enough fruits, vegetables and activity, then how about the school works to get them more deliciously prepared fruits and vegetables, and more options to engage in movement that are fun, non-humiliating, and help develop a life-long love of movement instead of leading to therapy sessions about the recurring nightmare you have of people hurl dodgeballs at you.
research from the University of Minnesota The truth about the BMI programs instituted in schools is that they were instituted without evidence as to their efficacy or of their chances of harming kids, and they continue despite the fact that there is no reason to believe that they work, and evidence that they are doing harm. According to“None of the behaviors being used by adolescents (in 1999) for weight-control purposes predicted weight loss[in 2006]…Of greater concern were the negative outcomes associated with dieting and the use of unhealthful weight-control behaviors.” Again from the PS Mag piece:
The CDC never encouraged states or school districts to mandate BMI testing in students. Even on its own website, the Center notes that BMI testing is not the answer: “There is insufficient evidence to conclude whether school-based BMI measurement programs are effective at preventing or reducing childhood obesity,” announced a 2007 study in the Journal of School Health… “School districts are passing policies ahead of the evidence,” says Allison Nihiser, who works within the division of population health at the CDC.
So instead of embarrassing and shaming kids while ruining their relationships with food, exercise and their bodies under the guise of making them healthier, what could we do? Kathleen Kara Fitzpatrick, a psychologist who works at the Stanford University Eating Disorders Clinic seems to have a pretty good idea:
“We need to teach kids to value their bodies and themselves, regardless of how they look or how they feel about themselves. The right time is right now.”
What might that look like? First of all, kids don't take care of things they hate, and that includes their bodies. If we teach kids to value their bodies and view them as amazing and worthy of care, we give them a shot at actually having a good relationship with their bodies. If we give them lots of options to be involved in movement (competitive and non-competitive sports, walking, yoga, dancing, weight lifting, video games that involved movement etc.) and if we teach kids to find ways to make movement fun, and not consider it a punishment for the size of their body (or because they should be terrified of having a larger body,) if we teach kids to eat a variety of foods and not to be scared of any foods, then we help them to have healthy relationships with food, movement, and their bodies, and they deserve that.
has a great list here If you're looking for resources, The Association for Size Diversity and Health
We need to do better for our kids than this, and the first step to helping is to stop hurting them with these ridiculous body shaming, hand-wringing over hard evidence interventions. And we need to stop right the hell now.

Hey there fellow tech-death fans! It's time to get shit popping with some blastbeats and finger cramping riff fueled music! But, like today's title denotes, music that does so with a flirtatious dive into the prog side of things as well.

Scalafrea- Opposites In Polarity
Denver, Colorado based act Scalafrea are a group I've been following for years now, and who only seem to improve by leaps and bounds with each release. Their latest, Opposites In Polarity, was one of my absolute favorite tech-death releases of 2015. I only even waited this long to post them in Tech-Death Tuesday because I was waiting for the band to make the release available for streaming/purchase on bandcamp. To make an abstract comparison here, Scalafrea are a jack-of-all-trades, yet unlike the rest of how that phrase usually goes, they are hardly the master of none. There are so many dimensions and different styles of tech-death on display throughout Opposites In Polarity, that it would be fruitless to name all the groups I could point to that parts of this sound like. In addition, the warm recording quality of this release is another plus in my book which really draws you in. As even I sometimes tire of the cold mechanical production nature of a lot of tech-death. Throw in a penchant for proggy builds and flourishes, and you've got yourself a impressive winner with Opposites In Polarity. Don't sleep on this one, and keep a watch out for their next one. Whenever that ends up happening. These guys are criminally underrated, so be that cool dude in your group and know about them!

Alustrium- A Tunnel To Eden
I'll fully admit to being late to the party on this one. There were too many releases that came out last year for me to check out everything I heard a positive buzz about. Regardless, I wanted to feature them here since they aren't a household name yet in the sense of everyone reading this already knowing them. Though I'm aware that some of you will have heard them, and if so, just focus on checking out Scalafrea! For anyone new to them like I am, Alustrium are a technical death metal band hailing from the state of Pennsylvania. A Tunnel To Eden came out last year, and stands as the groups second release overall. They have a pretty interesting blend of ideas going on in their musical stew. The composite of which sounds like a mix of certain aspects of Allegaeon, Psycroptic, and The Faceless. All wrapped together in a big proggy bow and a penchant for dense lengthy songs that take you on a vivid journey into aural bliss. Taken as a whole, A Tunnel To Eden is a fairly ambitious release by tech-death standards. Although I'm hoping they continue to evolve and take on a sound more their own in the future. Instead of one that is a slick melding of a few established ones as mentioned above like they sound now. Still, their phenomenal songwriting skills alone put them far ahead of most of the tech-death pack.

One person was believed to be behind the deadly attack in the subway in St. Petersburg, Russia, planting two bombs, one of which exploded, state media reported Monday.
At least 11 people were killed and some 45 others were wounded. Police initially believed a suicide bomber planted the device that exploded on a train, while a second person planted a separate device at a nearby station -- but investigators later said it appeared to be the work of one man, the Interfax news agency reported. Crews disabled the second device before it could explode.
Both bombs were filled with shrapnel, according to Sky News. The unexploded device was rigged with up to 2.2 pounds of explosives, Interfax added.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said investigators were looking into all possible causes. President Trump called it "absolutely a terrible thing," adding, "it's happening all over the world."
Late Monday, the White House said Trump called Putin to express his condolences for the bombing and to offer the full support of the United States "in responding to the attack and bringing those responsible to justice."
"We will look at all possible causes, terrorism as well as common crime." — Russian President Vladimir Putin
The 2:20 p.m. explosion rocked the train between the Technology Institute station and the Sennaya Square station, Russia's National Anti-Terrorist Committee said. Photos and video from one station appeared to show wounded victims on the smoke-filled platform, and a train car with a door blown out. Frantic commuters reached out through the doors and windows, shouting, "Call an ambulance!"
EGYPT'S EL-SISSI AND AMERICA'S TRUMP: A COMMON LANGUAGE?
Nobody immediately claimed responsibility for the blast. The National Anti-Terrorism Committee reported late Monday an 11th person had died.
"People were bleeding, their hair burned," a witness told Russia's Life News. "My girlfriend was in the next car that exploded. She said that he began to shake. When she came out, she saw that people were mutilated."
Russian media, The Associated Press and other news agencies sent out a photo of a bearded man dressed in black, initially claiming he was wanted in connection with the blast. Interfax later reported that the man went to police to claim he was innocent.
Trains and train stations have been common targets for terrorist attacks in Russia and throughout much of Europe, analysts point out.

Double suicide bombings in the Moscow subway in March 2010 killed 40 people and wounded more than 100 people. Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov claimed responsibility for that attack by two female suicide bombers, warning Russian leaders that "the war is coming to their cities."
A high-speed Moscow-to-St. Petersburg train was bombed on Nov. 27, 2009 in an attack that left 26 dead and some 100 injured. Umarov's group also said he ordered this attack.
Crews closed all subway stations in St. Petersburg Monday and evacuated passengers, administration officials said. Ambulances and other medical teams rushed to the scene.
The National Anti-Terrorism Committee vowed to tighten security at all of the country's critical transportation centers.
"The safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas is one of our highest priorities. The U.S. Consulate in St. Petersburg is monitoring the situation closely," a State Dept. spokesperson told Fox News.
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley tweeted a statement, part of which read: "We would like to extend our condolences to the people of Russia. We stand with you on defeating these extremist groups who continue to cause senseless harm against innocent people."
St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city with more than 5 million residents, is the country's most popular tourist destination. The two stations that were the site of the blast are some of the subway's busiest.
"The causes are not clear, it's too early. We will look at all possible causes, terrorism as well as common crime," Putin responded. "Law enforcement agencies and intelligence services are doing their best to establish the cause and give a full picture of what happened."
The Russian president offered condolences to the families of the victims. He was visiting the city -- his hometown -- and held talks Monday with the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko.
The Sennaya Ploschad station opened in 1963, the BBC reported.
German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said he learned of the explosion "with deep sorrow." He added that Germany's thoughts were "with our friends in Russia, the victims and their families in this dark hour." French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said his country would "stand by all those who suffer."

Recently one of my readers sent me this very accurate country ball cartoons, which just goes to show how thanks to the internet, more and more people are becoming familiar with Kremlin talking points and debate tactics.
Yep, that's pretty much the way it goes. But I was thinking about some whataboutist tactics lately and this reminded me of how pointless it is to try to teach these people by using your own country as an example. Kremlin supporters love to bring up the Vietnam War and all manner of heinous crimes carried out by the US government, but they forget two very important facts.
The first is that many of these crimes were opposed by either large numbers of people or at least prominent Americans. The second is that one reason they know about these crimes is because so much material on them has been published and popularized by Americans themselves. Want to know about US interventions and dirty wars since 1945? Check out Killing Hope by William Blum. Check out anything Noam Chomsky has ever written. Check out Michael Parenti. RT loves giving air time to authors and commentators who criticize American foreign policy without ever giving much thought to how easy it was for them to find people who have made their careers with that criticism.
I used to think that calling out the problems with the United States would show some of my Russian interlocutors that my condemnation of the Russian system, which is largely formed via personal experience and communication with hundreds of Russians in many different cities and towns over a period of more than eight years, is by no means an unfair, one-sided attack on Russia itself. Long time readers of this blog have seen how I have often compared the atmosphere in Russia today to that in America during the first few years after 11 September 2001. True, in the US you had a lot more leeway to protest and criticize the government, but a lot of people were intimidated out of fear for their job, fear of losing friends or colleagues, or even alienating their own family members.
Lately I realize that this kind of “criticize America, criticize Russia,” style is really a colossal waste of time. If you criticize the Vietnam War, the invasion of Iraq, or the shoddy handling of Syria or Euromaidan, your listener doesn't hear your analogies, they don't see the point you're trying to make. They don't think, “Hey wait a minute, Americans actually criticize their government all the time and don't listen to everything their media says! Maybe I should do the same!” What they think is “Here is an American who's badmouthing America. This confirms what I already believe!”
I've actually written about this topic before, namely how Russians and Americans can agree when they're condemning the actions of the US government, but the former see no solidarity with the latter. All that matters is that like Tim Kirby, you're confirming what their intelligentsia and media has been telling them for years. Now I think I've finally found a way to illustrate what appears to be going on in these conversations. Enjoy:
1. Kremlin Supporter uses: Whataboutism. It's super effective!
“Aggression in Ukraine? What about slavery? What about Ferguson? What about Vietnam? What about Iraq?”
2. What you say:
“Well I'm really glad you brought that up because you see, countries like America, the UK, Canada, Japan, Germany, and so on achieved their position today largely because they had massive struggles involving millions of citizens. Through debate and self-criticism, these countries learned to evolve and improve. This process never stops, but as long as people are allowed to speak their mind and participate in politics these struggles will continue and society will improve. Nobody can deny that 21st century America is far freer and functional than 19th century America, for example.
You mentioned slavery. Obviously Americans condemn slavery and fought their most destructive war to end it. Now there are some Americans who want to suppress the history of slavery because they claim that teaching that history is unpatriotic. Luckily there are plenty of people opposing that incorrect view, which is no longer dominant as it was decades ago. Pointing out America's flaws is the first step to correcting them. As for Ferguson, the protests you see show why civil society and freedom of speech are so important. Police brutality is a major problem in America today, but as you see people have organized on their own initiative to bring this issue into the spotlight. This is the first step towards change, and luckily that change doesn't require them to overthrow the American government.
You mention wars like Iraq and Vietnam. Were you not aware that both wars were opposed by millions of people and radically altered American politics? Failure in Vietnam brought down one administration and the Iraq War totally discredited Bush and his neoconservative ideologues. The next time an American politician tries to float the idea of invading and conquering another country, they will be confronted with Iraq and the horrible legacy of George W. Bush. “
3. What they hear.
“Well I'm really glad you brought that up because you see, countries like America, bzzzzzz, Japan, Germany, and so on achieved their position today largely because they had bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Nobody can deny that 21st century America is far freer and functional than bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
You mentioned slavery. Obviously Americans bzzzzzzzzzzzzzz slavery and fought bzzzz most destructive war bzzzzzzzz. Now there are some Americans who want to suppress the history of slavery because they bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz patriotic. Luckily bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz that bzzzzzzz view, bzzzzzzz is bzzzzzzzzzzzz dominant bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. As for Ferguson, bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Police brutality is bzzzzzzzzzzzz in America today, but as you see people have organized on their own initiative to bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz overthrow the American government.

This is basically what happens, though you can only truly appreciate this when you're arguing face to face. You can almost tell when they are paying attention and when they are tuning out because you started mentioning one of Russia's problems.
There are some people who should openly acknowledge Western mistakes when discussing Russia, namely Western leaders and diplomats. But for those of us living in Russia and dealing with the consequences of the government's policies just like any other Russian citizen, there is no such obligation. Obama's crap policies in regards to Syria didn't cut people's salaries in half or cancel any commuter trains in Russia.

Donald Trump's plans for the economy will boost deficits, interest rates and growth but also will create opportunities for ordinary investors.
Both Trump and Hillary Clinton promised sorely needed additional spending on roads and public structures—schools, railway stations and the like. Thoughtful proposals have been put forward to pay for some of these projects with private funds—for example, encouraging private businesses to build toll roads—but most projects only deliver revenue to investors over many years and up front private borrowing will be needed.
Many projects simply can't generate enough revenue directly through user fees to attract private capital, such as public facilities like parks and most mass transit, and those must be financed by new federal and state governments bonds.
Replacing Obamacare with direct subsidies and tax credits to help low and middle income Americans purchase health care may instigate more competition among private insurance companies, but it won't fundamentally lower prices for drugs, medical devices and the services offered by physicians, hospitals and the like. That would require implementing more far reaching reforms, such as the price controls imposed by the German government on its system of private insurance, and those are not likely to find much appeal in a Republican dominated congress.
In the end, providing relief from whopping increases in health insurance premiums for the millions of Americans who purchase individual policies on HealthCare.gov will require congress to allocate more money for subsidies—even if individuals are empowered to purchase insurance across state lines. Otherwise, they will face even higher deductibles, copays and limitations on coverage than Obamacare policies now impose. That will boost the federal deficit and require more borrowing.
Lowering corporate rates and slicing rates paid by small businesses who file individual federal and state tax returns can only be partially financed by closing loopholes and will increase the deficit. Similarly, providing a child care benefit to young families and broader individual tax relief won't be free.
Cutting taxes may boost growth—for example, a $100 billion tax cut overall many increase GDP by $120 billion, and that could generate as much as $30 billion in new revenue, but it would still swell the deficit by $70 billion.
The impacts of more spending on infrastructure, health care and tax relief could easily accelerate GDP growth by one percentage point but only at the expense of raising federal borrowing by hundreds of billions
Moreover, after years of austerity European governments were poised to increase deficits even before Trump's election. Now, nationalist movements on the continent are emboldened by his dramatic victory, and this will likely encourage sitting governments in France, Germany and elsewhere to placate voters with even more spending.
Overall, the West is headed for a mighty fiscal stimulus, and with high unemployment throughout most of southern Europe and many prime working age Americans standing on the sidelines, employment, wages and incomes will rise—a lot!
Globalists are apoplectic that Trump's promise to redefine trade with Mexico, China and others will wholly disrupt international commerce but look for cooler heads to prevail. U.S. manufacturing supply chains are too integrated with Mexican and Chinese facilities to be simply disrupted by huge new tariffs. Instead, Trump has options to leverage our trading partners to renegotiate existing agreements to reduce the U.S. trade deficit. That would further increase the demand for what Americans make.
Some of this burst in borrowing and GDP will simply increase inflation but most will result in the production of more U.S.-made goods and services. Either way, interest rates and corporate profits will rise.
The elderly will again be able to obtain decent interest rates from banks on their CDs, and ordinary Americans can look forward to higher stock market returns in their retirement savings accounts.
Young adults through those in their 50s should be investing in stocks most of what they won't need over the next five years—for example for down payments on houses, to pay college costs and as a cushion against a personal emergency. However, it is foolish to try to beat the market and pick the industries and companies that will benefit most from Trump's program.
Instead buy an S&P 500 index fund, which covers about 80 percent of U.S. publicly traded equities, and perhaps allocate 20 percent to a similarly broad based international fund.
At retirement, folks should be 50 percent in cash—including money market deposits that are quickly converted to cash–and only gradually invest in CDs as interest rates rise.
It's finally time to get optimistic again!

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan and Canada share “serious concerns” over reclamation and militarization in the South China Sea, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Tuesday, in an apparent reference to China's maritime activity.

China and the United States have traded accusations of militarizing the South China Sea as Beijing undertakes large-scale land reclamation and construction on disputed features while Washington has increased its patrols and exercises.
Abe's comment, made at a joint news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, came ahead of a Group of Seven summits later this week, where maritime security, along with the global economy and terrorism, will be among main issues.
“As for the South China Sea, we share serious concerns over unilateral actions that raise tensions, such as large-scale reclamation, the building of facilities and militarization,” Abe told reporters.
“It is a significant achievement that we have agreed to cooperate to secure rule-based, free, safe seas,” he said, referring to his talks with Trudeau.
China claims almost the entire South China Sea. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims to parts of the waters, through which about $5 trillion in trade is shipped every year.
Tokyo has no claims on the waterway but worries about China's growing military reach into sea lanes through which much of Japan's ship-borne trade passes.
Trudeau steered clear of the maritime dispute in his comments and instead chose to focus on economic ties with Japan.
“As part of our delegation, Canada's trade minister is here. She will be meeting with Japanese companies and is expected to make a number of announcements as part of her visit,” he said.
He did not elaborate on the plans of International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland in Japan.

A Russian military spacecraft with a high-resolution digital mapping camera is in orbit Thursday after a successful ascent aboard a Soyuz rocket.
The Soyuz-2.1a rocket lifted off at 0942 GMT (5:42 a.m. EDT; 12:42 p.m. local time) from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northern Russia, a military spaceport about 500 miles (800 kilometers) north of Moscow, according to a statement released by the Russian Ministry of Defense.
The launch went normally, Russian defense officials said, and the rocket deployed its secretive payload in orbit less than 10 minutes after liftoff.
U.S. tracking data show two objects attributed to Thursday's flight — the Soyuz rocket's third stage and the Russian military satellite — in an orbit with a low point of around 201 miles (324 kilometers) and a high point of around 333 miles (536 kilometers) with an inclination of 97.6 degrees to Earth's equator.
The satellite lofted Thursday is believed to be Russia's second spacecraft in the Bars-M series of sharp-eyed optical reconnaissance platforms.
The first member of the Bars-M series launched in February 2015 from the same launch pad at Plesetsk, and aboard the same type of Soyuz booster, which features a modernized digital flight control system to replace analog guidance employed aboard earlier versions of Russia's workhorse rocket.
Made by TsSKB Progress in Samara, Russia, the Bars-M satellite's capabilities are classified, but analysts believe it hosts a digital imager, replacing older satellites that carried film cameras that returned to Earth via parachute to be recovered and developed.
The Bars-M satellite's Karat electro-optical camera was developed by the Leningrad Optical Mechanical Association, and the satellite is expected to operate at least five years, according to documents posted on a Russian government procurement website.
The upgrade allows the Bars-M satellites to remain in orbit longer and send imagery to analysts via radio links.
The last of the old-generation satellites launched in 2005, leaving Russia with a gap in the imaging capability to be filled by Bars-M, which specializes in collecting stereo images to help create maps for use by the Russian military.
The Russian Defense Ministry said Thursday that the new satellite received the designation Kosmos 2515, keeping with the military's naming scheme for defense-related spacecraft.
The Kosmos 2515 satellite is functioning normally after Thursday's launch, and ground controllers are in contact with the spacecraft, the defense ministry reported on its website.

Chelsea striker Alvaro Morata has accepted the challenge of Sevilla's Pablo Sarabia to participate in a signed-shirt auction to benefit the victims of a September earthquake that devastated parts of Mexico and Mexico City.
The footballing community is continuing to aid those affected by the magnitude 7.1 earthquake on Sept. 19, with players auctioning off signed shirts to raise funds.
@pablosarabia92 ya esta de camino la camiseta para @futbolconmexico espero poder ayudar y a ver si @iscoalarcon @marcoasensio10 y @kikocasilla se animan también! ⚽️✌️❤️ A post shared by Álvaro Morata (@alvaromorata) on Oct 3, 2017 at 1:27am PDT
Mexico-based players like Club America's William da Silva, Cruz Azul's Gabriel Penalba and Chivas' Jesus Sanchez have all joined in and the campaign is starting to go international.
On Tuesday, Morata took up the challenge and nominated Isco, Marco Asensio and Kiko Casilla, after Sevilla's Sarabia originally nominated him. Mexico women's national team forward Charlyn Corral also donated a shirt to the cause.
Funds raised from the auctions will go to either the Red Cross or the Fundacion Carlos Slim, depending on which the winner decides.
The organizers confirmed to ESPN FC via email that the auction will be finalized on Oct. 21 and the shirts will be sold as individual pieces in most cases.
The effort is being coordinated by a group called "El Futbol con Mexico" (Football for Mexico) and is using the hashtag #futbol1sismo0 or "football 1, earthquake 0."
I did not become a Christian so I would have to fight for my constitutional freedoms all over again.
Growing up in Alabama being black, knowing how that felt and the way I was treated in an all-white world of power and control, I had to fight for equal rights under the Constitution. How ironic now as a Christian to have those same thoughts and feelings again and to have to try and wrestle control of my constitutional rights from the secular community.
Many reading this may not understand where I came up with this concept of calling Christians “the new Negro.”
The reason is because there are undeniable similarities. Jim Crow laws were passed to keep me from having my constitutional rights and my rights under the Declaration of Independence of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Even though the Constitution gave me those freedoms, man was smart enough to be able to keep me from living those freedoms by saying I was “separate but equal.”
Today, my constitutional right of freedom of religion is being eroded again by laws such as the Hate Crimes Bill and repeated attacks by the politically correct crowd. Threats that came along as a result of an African American wanting to get out from under Jim Crow laws were formidable and scary and designed to keep African Americans quiet. The same thing is happening to Christians today.
“Speechless: Silencing the Christians,” by Don Wildmon, lays out determined strategy of coalition of liberal secularists, homosexual activists and Fortune 500 companies
Another way secular society is trying to control Christians is by the fallacy of the separation of church and state. That establishment clause was intended to protect the church from the state, not to keep the church from participating in the state. Christians' ignorance of the meaning of the establishment clause has allowed us to be controlled just like the African Americans were in the 1950s and '60s.
Many may question why I'm writing this article because they can't see the fight in our society and world concerning the overt attack on Judeo-Christian values.
If you don't believe one could be attacked for one's stand on Judeo-Christian beliefs alone, take the case of Miss California, Carrie Prejean. Look at her refusal to compromise her Christian values. She has been vilified and demonized and lost her title simply because of her constitutional right to freedom of religion. What is so encouraging is that she will not compromise; she will not give up her values and would rather please God than take what the world has to offer her.
Sarah Palin is another example.
The politically correct crowd has a very difficult time dealing with Sarah because of who she is. Mrs. Palin is a pro-life, pro-gun, pro-traditional-marriage, pro-hunting, white, conservative, Christian male who happened to have been born a woman! The politically correct crowd knows exactly what to do with a white male with those attributes, but a woman?
She is the perfect picture of the politically correct woman – strong, beautiful, able to both buy and fry the bacon, take care of the family, run an entire state and still take care of her baby. But because of who she is, and because she does not subscribe to politically correct thinking, she has been attacked for no other reason than her Judeo-Christian values, just as African Americans were attacked for no other reason than their skin color.
If you still don't think Christians are being attacked for our beliefs, consider Pastor Ake Green in Sweden and Pastor Stephen Boisson in Canada and many other men of God around the world who have been jailed and had their nonprofit status threatened because they dare to call homosexuality a sin. The sad commentary is many Christians have backed off our God-given responsibility to tell the truth because secular society has deemed the truth “political.” Marriage is a church issue, pornography is a church issue, homosexuality is a church issue, and divorce is a church issue. The problem is, as soon as the secular elites named them political, the evangelical church – especially the white evangelical church – retreated and held up the cowardly white flag.
If you don't think Christians have become the new Negro, just look at Christmas! We are no longer able to celebrate Christmas in schools. Even though as taxpayers, our tax dollars help pay for our broken educational system, we are forced to celebrate winter break and the fabulous “holiday tree!”
How about the wonderful greeting, “Happy Holidays!”? Department stores are afraid to put up signs with the word “Christmas” on them. Don't mistakenly think this is anything new. Secular society began taking Christ out of Christmas when they started calling it “Xmas” – and we let it happen.
In my wonderful state of Washington just last year, Gov. Christine Gregoire and the state legislators allowed an Atheist Manifesto to be put up right next to the Nativity scene of our Lord Jesus Christ! I have to say straightforward: the state of Washington is the armpit of the United States, and our lovely legislators are supplying the odoriferous scent to the armpit.
Because 2008 was such a disaster, this year there will be no Christmas or religious displays in the Capitol rotunda, period. Oh, except they will put up a huge holiday tree.
Can anybody tell me where common sense is? Everyone in the world knows it's a Christmas tree. This nonsense is all in the name of tolerance toward whom? It's certainly not toward those of us who hold strong Judeo-Christian values. As Christians, it's an attack on what we hold dear. But just like the Negroes, Christians should understand they are not equal under the Constitution's right to freedom of religion.
The only difference between Christians and African Americans is that Christians put up with this intolerance while standing behind the false disguise of humility and love. We are obsessed with showing the world our love when our primary job is to tell them the truth. The Bible does not say, “Sensitivity shall set you free.” It says, “The truth shall set you free.” Are we not the truth-tellers?
When are we as believers, like the African Americans that came before us, going to say, enough is enough? No more “separate but equal!” Our battle cry is “We are the salt of the earth, onward Christian soldiers and to God be the glory! For in unity we will stand and we will not be stopped!”
Introduction
Corbis
When the Cherokee were relocated from the South to present-day Oklahoma in the 1830s, their black slaves were moved with them. Though an 1866 treaty gave the descendants of the slaves full rights as tribal citizens, regardless of ancestry, the Cherokee Nation has tried to expel them because they lack "Indian blood."
The battle has been long fought. A recent ruling by the Cherokee Supreme Court upheld the tribe's right to oust 2,800 Freedmen, as they are known, and cut off their health care, food stipends and other aid in the process.
But federal officials told the tribe that they would not recognize the results of a tribal election later this month if the citizenship of the black members was not restored. Faced with a cutoff of federal aid, a tribal commission this week offered the Freedmen provisional ballots, a half-step denounced by the black members.
Is the effort to expel of people of African descent from Indian tribes an exercise of tribal sovereignty, as tribal leaders claim, or a reversion to Jim Crow, as the Freedmen argue? Kevin Noble Maillard, a professor of law at Syracuse University and a member of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, organized this discussion of the issue.
