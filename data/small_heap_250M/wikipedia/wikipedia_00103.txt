The HM-3 is a submachine gun of Mexican origin chambered in the 9mm calibre and, since 2011, in .380 ACP caliber for private security forces, from a magazine fed from the grip, much like the Uzi.
This sub-machine gun is manufactured by Productos Mendoza, S.A. in Mexico. It is a lightweight weapon of reduced overall length achieved by largely extending the wrap around bolt forward around the barrel. A grip safety is provided to prevent accidental discharge. The stock is designed in a manner that makes folding and unfolding easy and provides a foregrip when the stock is folded. The selector lever is on the right-hand side of the weapon so that it can be operated by the right hand without releasing the weapon with either hand. The stock can be folded or unfolded while gripping the weapon with both hands unlike the previous models of the same gun. It is much like the UZI in the way that the magazine is located on the grip.
Variants
9mm caliber models
There are currently three variations on the HM-3 using a 9mm caliber round. The HM-3-S LONG is a 15.74 in (23.85 in with extended stock) long model, used primarily for the Mexican Police and other State and Municipal security forces. The HM-3-S SHORT is almost identical, with the exception that the barrel is shortened and therefore measures only 12.99 in (21.06 in with extended stock). The HM-3-S BULLDOG (also called HM-3-S Mini) is a miniature version of the weapon, especially designed to be carried by motorcycle police and bodyguards, and measures only 10.8 in (19.3 in with extended stock) in length and weighs 2,827 g (6.2 lbs) with a full 32-round magazine. All versions may use 20 or 32-round magazines.
.380 caliber models
Since 2011, Productos Mendoza has manufactured a variation of the HM-3-S that shoots a .380 ACP caliber round. This is the largest caliber available to use by private security companies and individuals in Mexico, and the most popular caliber for personal defence in Latin America. The HM-3-S LONG model is called "COBRA .380" and the HM-3-S BULLDOG is called "BULLDOG .380". These names were created to facilitate the models' introduction to the consumer market. All specs are the same (excluding caliber) than the HM-3-S 9mm models, with the exception that .380 models can carry a 35-round magazine.

Nigel Jones (born 1951) is a British historian, journalist and biographer.
Early life
Born in Woking, Surrey, he spent childhood in Surrey, Sussex, Kent and rural Yorkshire. He was educated at schools in the Isle of Wight and North Wales. His journalistic career began on local newspapers in Hertfordshire and the Cambridge Evening News where he was Crown Court correspondent. He then spent almost two years in Germany, learning the language, studying the history and working in factories in Karlsruhe, Reutlingen and Berlin.
Career
In the 1980s he worked for the Press Association news agency in London and as an editor with BBC and Independent Radio News IRN.
His first book, The War Walk: A Journey along the Western Front (1983), was inspired by his father, Frank Jones (1890-1970), a Great War veteran. For the book he walked along the trench lines of the Western front, interviewing more than 30 veterans of the conflict. Among these was the German author and war hero Ernst Jünger. His stay with Jünger inspired his second book, Hitler's Heralds: the story of the Freikorps 1918-1923 (1987. Reissued in 2004 as A Brief History of the birth of the Nazis).
His third book was inspired by the discovery in 1988 of an archive of letters, papers and manuscripts of the English novelist and playwright Patrick Hamilton (1904-1962) which were bequeathed to him by Hamilton's sister-in-law, Aileen Hamilton, and used in his biography of Hamilton, Through a Glass Darkly (1990 : reissued 2008).
In 1991 Jones moved to Vienna, Austria, where he joined the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF) and broadcast worldwide on Radio Austria International. It was at this time that his only stage play End of the Night, based on the life of French novelist Louis-Ferdinand Celine, was produced at Brighton's Pavilion Theatre in November 1991.
Returning to England in 1995, he worked as a freelance journalist for The Guardian and The Spectator while writing his biography of the poet Rupert Brooke, Life, Death and Myth (1999).
He was a deputy editor of History Today magazine (1999-2000) and reviews editor of BBC History Magazine (2000-2003).
His next book was a brief life of Britain's Fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley, Mosley, published by Haus in 2004.
His recent publications include a history of the plots to assassinate Hitler, Countdown to Valkyrie, published by Frontline Books in January 2009, and Tower: An Epic History of the Tower of London, published by Hutchinson in 2011 and released in the US in 2012 by St. Martin's Press.
Jones has written for most of Britain's national newspapers, including The Times and The Sunday Times, the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph; and the Daily Snail and Daily Express. He reviews books regularly for The Literary Review.
He initiated and appeared in the BBC film Journey to Hell (2003) about the war poet Wilfred Owen, and a BBC film biography of Patrick Hamilton (2004). He has also presented a BBC Radio Four portrait of Hamilton, Portrait in Black (2004), and a Radio Four documentary about the SS Lebensborn children's homes in Nazi Germany, Fountain of Life (2006).
Jones is a frequent contributor to the World Association of International Studies (WAIS) online discussion group, created by Ronald Hilton of Stanford University.
Jones also conducts adult and schools tours of the Western Front, "In the Footsteps of the war poets".
Personal life

Career
Green started as a youth player with Bradford City, before being signed by Everton in October 2011 for an initial fee of £300,000 that could have risen as high as £2 million and received a £45,000 signing-on fee. He joined the club's youth setup, and was a member of the side that won the 2014 U18 Premier League.

The epitympanic recess is a hollow located on the superior/roof aspect of the middle ear.
Clinical significance
This recess is a possible route of spread of infection to the mastoid air cells located in the mastoid process of the temporal bone of the skull. Inflammation which has spread to the mastoid air cells is very difficult to drain and causes considerable pain. Before the advent of antibiotics it could only be drained by drilling a hole in the mastoid bone, a process known as mastoidectomy.

UFC 203: Miocic vs. Overeem was a mixed martial arts event produced by the Ultimate Fighting Championship held on September 10, 2016, at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio.
Background
This was the first UFC event in Cleveland.
The event was headlined by a UFC Heavyweight Championship bout between current champion (and Cleveland area native) Stipe Miocic against 2010 K-1 World Grand Prix winner and former Strikeforce Heavyweight Champion Alistair Overeem.
The professional debut of former professional wrestler CM Punk took place at this event. Punk, who signed with the UFC in December 2014, had a delayed debut due to past injuries from professional wrestling that needed treatment and also due to his need for training time. He made his debut against Mickey Gall in a welterweight bout.
Ben Rothwell was expected to face former heavyweight champion Fabrício Werdum at this event. However, on August 11, Rothwell pulled out due to injury. A team representative said he may have suffered a torn meniscus and could have an ACL injury. He was replaced by Travis Browne. This was a rematch as Werdum defeated Browne via unanimous decision at UFC on Fox: Werdum vs. Browne in 2014.
A lightweight bout between Erik Koch and Drew Dober was originally booked for UFC 195, but Koch pulled out due to an injury and the bout was scrapped. The fight was later rescheduled for this event, until Koch pulled out again due to injury and was replaced by promotional newcomer Jason Gonzalez.
Mairbek Taisumov was expected to face Nik Lentz at the event. However, Taisumov was removed from the fight on September 1 for alleged visa issues and replaced by promotional newcomer Michael McBride.
On September 5, it was announced that the lightweight bout between Damir Hadžović and Yusuke Kasuya, slated to open the preliminary portion of the card, was postponed and will now take place at October's UFC Fight Night: Lamas vs. Penn after Hadžović experienced issues with his travel visa.
Ray Borg was scheduled to face Ian McCall at the event. However, Borg pulled out of the fight on September 7 citing an illness. With no time to find a suitable replacement, McCall was removed from the card.
Michael McBride missed weight, coming in at 158 lb. As a result, he was fined 20% of his fight purse, which went to his opponent Nik Lentz.
On the day of the event, C.B. Dollaway was forced out of his bout against Francimar Barroso due to a back injury he sustained in a malfunctioning elevator at his hotel. As a result, Barroso was also removed from the event.

The island algorithm is an algorithm for performing inference on hidden Markov models, or their generalization, dynamic Bayesian networks.
It calculates the marginal distribution for each unobserved node, conditional on any observed nodes.
The island algorithm is a modification of belief propagation.
It trades smaller memory usage for longer running time: while belief propagation takes O(n) time and O(n) memory, the island algorithm takes O(n log n) time and O(log n) memory. On a computer with an unlimited number of processors, this can be reduced to O(n) total time, while still taking only O(log n) memory.
The algorithm
For simplicity, we describe the algorithm on hidden Markov models. It can be easily generalized to dynamic Bayesian networks by using a junction tree.
Belief propagation involves sending a message from the first node to the second, then using this message to compute a message from the second node to the third, and so on until the last node (node N). Independently, it performs the same procedure starting at node N and going in reverse order. The i-th message depends on the (i-1)-th, but the messages going in opposite directions do not depend on one another. The messages coming from both sides are required to calculate the marginal distribution for a node. In normal belief propagation, all messages are stored, which takes O(n) memory.
The island begins by passing messages as usual, but it throws away the i-th message after sending the (i+1)-th one.
When the two message-passing procedures meet in the middle, the algorithm recurses on each half of the chain.
Since the chain is divided in two at each recursive step, the depth of the recursion is log(N). Since every message must be passed again at each level of depth, the algorithm takes O(n log n) time on a single processor. Two messages must be stored at each recursive step, so the algorithm uses O(log n) space.
Given log(N) processors, algorithm can be run in O(n) time by using a separate processor to do each recursive step (thus taking N/2 + N/4 + N/8 ... = N time on a single processor).

Lost in Alphaville is the third full-length studio album by The Rentals, released on August 25, 2014, through Polyvinyl Records. The album is available on CD, vinyl, cassette and as a digital download. It marks the band's first full-length album since their 1999 release Seven More Minutes and their first-ever release through Polyvinyl, with whom they signed in December 2013.
Background and recording
After The Rentals disbanded following the tour for 1999's Seven More Minutes, the band reunited in 2005 and released The Last Little Life EP as well as four mini-albums as part of their multimedia project Songs About Time throughout 2009.
On December 5, 2013, Matt Sharp announced that The Rentals had signed with Polyvinyl Records for the release of their forthcoming studio album, which would be their first full-length in 15 years. The album, recorded in Los Angeles, Nashville and New Orleans, is mostly made up of newly rerecorded songs from Songs About Time and features The Black Keys' drummer Patrick Carney, Lucius' Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig on vocals, Ozma's guitarist Ryen Slegr and Lauren Chipman of The Section Quartet on viola and piano. Sharp and the band are credited with producing the album and it was mixed by Grammy-winning producer Dave Sardy.
Critical reception
Lost in Alphaville received mostly positive feedback from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 69 out of 100, which indicates "generally favorable reviews" based on 13 reviews.
Tim Sendra of AllMusic called the album "a huge-sounding modern indie rock album with a glossy sheen on the surface, but all kinds of heart beating just below." Giving the album an eight out of ten rating, Jeff Milo of Paste wrote, "It's far from the slapped-together shambolic style of '90s power-pop; no, this sounds much more arranged, almost like tightened chamber pop if it were clouded by the murk of shoegaze."

Inquiry Magazine, sometimes titled Inquiry: A Libertarian Review, was a libertarian magazine published from November 1977 to 1984. It was originally published by the Cato Institute, then later transferred to the Libertarian Review Foundation.
History
Inquiry Magazine was founded in 1977 as part of the Cato Institute, in an effort by libertarian donor Charles Koch and Cato president Ed Crane to build public policy institutions for the libertarian movement. Williamson Evers was its first editor. After Evers was ousted as editor in a dispute with Crane, Glenn Garvin took over in 1980. Doug Bandow served as editor from 1982 until the magazine's closure in 1984. At different points in its history, its editorial staffers included Frank Browning, Jonathan Marshall, Mark Paul, Ralph Raico, and Jack Shafer. Its poetry editor was Dana Gioia.
In the early 1980s, Koch and Crane grew dissatisfied with the publishing efforts they supported, which included Inquiry Magazine and the Libertarian Review. They decided to stop publishing the Libertarian Review and move Inquiry Magazine from the Cato Institute to the control of the separately managed Libertarian Review Foundation at the beginning of 1982. With the June 1982 issue, Inquiry Magazine was retitled Inquiry: A Libertarian Review. The magazine's circulation had always been low and had declined below 10,000. Citing financial concerns, Koch and Crane closed the magazine in 1984.
The magazine originally was published biweekly from 1977 to 1978, then switched to semi-monthly, with about 20 issues per year in its first four and a half years of publication. In 1982 it switched to monthly publication, then went to 10 issues a year in 1984. The final issue was published in July 1984.
During its run, it made available bound collections of issues from its first four volumes ('77–'78, '78–'79, '79–'80, '80–'81).
Audience and viewpoints
Established along with Cato, Inquiry was initially a journal of investigative reporting and libertarian-oriented opinion. The magazine was aimed at libertarians and at liberals and leftists critical of state power. It featured regular columns by Nat Hentoff on civil liberties and Thomas Szasz on psychiatry, foreign reporting by Penny Lernoux, and CIA exposes by such writers as David Wise and Fred Landis. It included extensive cultural coverage as well, including reviews by Anthony Burgess and film criticism by Stephen Harvey.

Blandine Ebinger (born Blandine Loeser) (4 November 1899, in Berlin – 25 December 1993, in Berlin) was a German actress and chansonniere.
Career
Ebinger became acquainted with Friedrich Hollaender in 1919, and with him she became heavily invested as a performer, writer, and composer in the Berlin cabaret scene in the 1920s, beginning in the cabaret and the Café des Westens. She recorded many of her husband's, Friedrich Hollaender, cabaret songs, including the set of songs entitled . Ebinger emigrated to the United States in 1937, returning to Berlin in 1947. She moved to Munich, where she met her second husband, the publisher Helwig Hassepflug, in 1961. They eventually settled back in Berlin, where she continued her career in the theater and as an actress on television productions.
Family
Ebinger was the daughter of the pianist Gustav Loeser and the actress Margarete Wezel. She married Friedrich Hollaender. Although Ebinger and Hollaender ended their marriage before Hollaender emigrated to the United States because of the increasingly hostile environment for Jewish citizens in the early 1930s, Ebinger nevertheless faced discrimination as a result of the marriage, much of which was directed at their half-Jewish daughter, Philine, who was briefly married to Georg Kreisler.
Death
Ebinger died on 25 December 1993 in Berlin and is buried on the Waldfriedhof Dahlem. She was 94 years old.

Bridgetown is a Canadian community located in north-central Annapolis County, Nova Scotia.
History
Situated on the Annapolis River at the head of the tide, the area saw Mi'kmaq settlements, followed by Acadian settlers from Port-Royal and then British-sponsored settlements by the late 18th century.
There were at least ten Acadian settlers in the Bridgetown area before the French census of 1671, and the population doubled by 1707. The main Acadian settlement was on the east boundary of the present town, called Gaudetville. There were other Acadian settlers in the town proper, some of whom lived just east of the present bridge.
Several armed skirmishes occurred in neighbouring Carleton Corner during Queen Anne's War (the Battle of Bloody Creek (1711)) and several decades later, the Seven Years' War (the Battle of Bloody Creek (1757)).
Deed references suggest British settlement in Bridgetown from the early 1760s onward, after the Acadians were expelled from Nova Scotia in 1755. These settlers appeared shortly after the allocation of Granville Township among its proprietors; Bridgetown is located in what was formerly Granville Township, settled from 1760 on. The central part of Bridgetown was referred to as the Farm of Henly for unknown reasons. The community grew into a successful wooden shipbuilding area during the 19th century, accounting for many grand homes. It was incorporated as a town in 1897. The town was actually an entrepot for the agricultural and forest products of the surrounding areas and became a significant manufacturing and commercial centre in the 19th century. Manufacturing included a furniture factory, an organ factory, a tannery, a bottling plant, a cider plant, the first M.W. Graves cannery and vinegar factory (Graves was a major food processor that later moved to Kings County) and a distillery.
The community is one of few in Nova Scotia to have developed from a formal town plan (or plat), rather than allowing development to proceed unhindered. Captain John Crosskill, who owned or controlled the central part of the community, what is now downtown, divided the bulk of the lands into 90 by 90 lots in 1821. and most of these boundaries remain visible to this day. As the community developed, the heirs of Capt. Crosskill planned several additional subdivisions, some of which were wildly optimistic.
The community was named at a gathering of local residents about 1824. There are two versions of the rationale for the name. The more romantic has it that the community was named after Bridgetown, Barbados, because Captain Crosskill had once been stationed there, and had apparently much enjoyed it. The other simply attributes the name to the presence of a bridge over the Annapolis River. This version is given some credence because Joseph Howe, in his Rambles, refers to the area as "The Bridge". Likely there were proponents of both theories at the meeting, and since both sides wanted the name Bridgetown it will never be possible to sort out how many had which reason.
The Windsor and Annapolis Railway (W&A) constructed its mainline between Windsor and Annapolis Royal through the area in 1868, crossing over the Annapolis River on a bridge between the north and south banks in the community. The original W&A crossing was a wooden covered bridge that was replaced in 1881 by the present iron railway bridge. The W&A merged into the Dominion Atlantic Railway (DAR), a subsidiary of Canadian Pacific Railway, and operated until 1990. The Middleton and Victoria Beach Railway was constructed through the north end of Bridgetown in the early 20th century and this line came under the ownership of Canadian National Railway, operating until 1982.
Various small industries clustered around both rail lines. The DAR had a passenger station and small railway yard on the south bank of the river. A brick plant, soda pop factory, and various apple warehouses were built along the railway in this area. CN had a passenger station as well as a small yard on the north bank of the river, serving various apple warehouses and the Acadian Distillery factory. Most industries had closed by the 1980s and today, few remnants of the railways are visible, except for the former DAR station which was converted into a pub, formerly known as the “End of The Line Pub”. Under new ownership, it is now known as “The Station”.
In 1966, Bridgetown had a population of 1,060, of which 140 were African Nova Scotians. Black people have a long history in Bridgetown, residing primarily in the areas of Inglewood Road, "The Pasture" and "The Tracks".
Heritage buildings
The Morse-Magwood House was built in 1871 and is noted as a fine example of Second Empire architecture and is considered one of the most picturesque homes in the province. The Rothsay Masonic Temple was built in 1871 as a Presbyterian church, but purchased in 1925 by the Rothsay Lodge of the Masonic Order. It is a brick structure in the Gothic Revival style.
Present day
Like a lot of small communities, Bridgetown today concentrates on service industries. The largest employers are the school and Mountains and Meadows Care Group. Britex Limited was the last large manufacturing enterprise but closed in 2004.
Bridgetown is roughly equidistant between Middleton and Annapolis Royal. Trunk 1 runs through the community on Granville Street. During the 1980s, Highway 101 was extended to Bridgetown, terminating at an interchange with Trunk 1. This highway was extended in the early 1990s through to Annapolis Royal, bypassing the community completely.
Today Bridgetown has many heritage buildings which are best appreciated by taking The Cyprus Walk self-guided and critically acclaimed walking tour.
The new P-12 Bridgetown Regional Community School(BRCS)opened in 2017, to replace the former high school(BRHS) and former elementary school(BRES), both located in the east end of the town. BRHS was demolished and the site became green space and athletic fields, integrated with the new school site southeast of the former BRHS. The historic downtown fronting Queen Street underwent redevelopment and beautification during the 1980s as a result of federal grants.
Bridgetown hosts an annual Ciderfest festival to celebrate the apple harvest every fall. The mascot, "Andy Apple-head" is a popular character among children and participates in the Ciderfest parade.
Bridgetown is twinned with Bridgetown, Barbados.
Demographics
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Bridgetown had a population of 970 living in 470 of its 514 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 949. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
Government
Bridgetown was incorporated as a town on September 15, 1897. The first mayor of the town was Harry Ruggles, elected by acclamation.
In 2011, the town council drew national headlines by resigning en masse over financial difficulties including a misappropriation of funds by a municipal employee who was later convicted. A subsequent provincial audit found that $113,195.96 had been misappropriated from the town over 5 years by one employee, and additional losses were incurred from related costs and record-keeping errors. The provincial government subsequently appointed an interim council consisting of a mayor and two councillors, which governed the town until municipal elections were held in October 2012.
In November 2012 a new council (mayor and four councillors) was sworn in, and the provincially appointed council ceased to hold office.
On March 31, 2014, the town council voted to give up the town's municipal charter effective April 1, 2015, dissolving the town into the larger Municipality of the County of Annapolis. The council cited ongoing financial pressures in the form of increased costs to provide services and pension obligations, as well as declining revenue from the town's property tax base.

Hanging Rock (also known as Mount Diogenes, Dryden's Rock, and to some of its traditional owners as Ngannelong) is a distinctive geological formation in central Victoria, Australia. A former volcano, it lies 718m above sea level (105m above plain level) on the plain between the two small townships of Newham and Hesket, approximately 70 km north-west of Melbourne and a few kilometres north of Mount Macedon.
In the middle of the 19th century, the traditional occupants of the place – tribes of the Dja Dja Wurrung, Woi Wurrung and Taungurung – were forced from it. They had been its occupants for thousands of years and, colonisation notwithstanding, have continued to maintain cultural and spiritual connections with the place.
To the settler colonialist society, Hanging Rock became a place for recreation and tourism. It came alternately under private, government, and mixed public-private control.
In the late 20th century, the area became very widely known as the setting of Joan Lindsay's novel Picnic at Hanging Rock.
Toponyms
Attempts to uncover Hanging Rock's Aboriginal name have proven difficult. Some think it is "Anneyelong" because of an inscription underneath an engraving of the rock made by German naturalist, William Blandowski, during an expedition in 1855–56. Historian and toponymist Ian D. Clark believes Blandowski misheard the name, and the word was possibly "Ngannelong" or something similar. The name "Diogenes Mount" was bestowed on the rock by the surveyor Robert Hoddle in 1843 in keeping with the spirit of several ancient Macedonian names given by Major Thomas Mitchell during his expedition through Victoria in 1836, which passed close to Hanging Rock. Others include Mount Macedon, Mount Alexander and the Campaspe River. Six other European names (Mount Diogenes, Diogenes' Head, Diogenes Monument, Dryden's Rock, Dryden's Monument and Hanging Rock) have also been recorded for the site.
Geology
Hanging Rock is a mamelon, created 6.25 million years ago by stiff magma pouring from a vent and congealing in place. Often thought to be a volcanic plug, it is not. Two other mamelons exist nearby, created in the same period: Camels Hump, to the south on Mount Macedon and, to the east, Crozier's Rocks. Alternative names for Crozier's Rocks are Brock's Monument, Alexander's Head and Mount Crystal. All three mamelons are composed of soda trachyte. As Hanging Rock's magma cooled and contracted it split into rough columns. These weathered over time into the many pinnacles that can be seen today.
The significance of these three mamelons demonstrates the mechanism of plate tectonics. As the Australian Plate moved northwards towards East Asia, over a period of 27 million years it passed over a volcanic hotspot. This resulted in a chain of volcanoes stretching from Hillsborough (33 million years ago) in Northern Queensland to Hanging Rock (6.5 million years ago) which is part of the southernmost end of this volcanic activity. This chain also includes the Warrumbungles (New South Wales, 15.5 million years ago) and the Glass House Mountains (Southern Queensland, 24.3 million years ago). These volcanoes all have the same chemical composition.
Hanging Rock contains numerous distinctive rock formations, including the "Hanging Rock" itself (a boulder suspended between other boulders, under which is the main entrance path), the Colonnade, the Eagle and the UFO. The highest point on Hanging Rock is 718 metres above sea level and 105 metres above the plain below.
Traditional owners and colonisation
At the time of colonisation, the traditional occupants had lived around Hanging Rock for more than 26,000 years. The Rock was woven into the fabric of the culture of the traditional owners. However, they were forcibly displaced from the area. Jason Tamiru has expressed a Yung Balug perspective on this history:The truth is my people were hit hard during the frontier wars. The Western region is known to us as the Killing Fields. The naming of the Rock is with all those that come in my dreams. Australia is starting to learn that there is a black history in this country that needs to be acknowledged and celebrated.Long before the 1967 novel, 1975 film and the naming of Hanging Rock, Tribes of the Dja Dja Wurrung, Woi Wurrung and Taungurung would gather at that location for important Men's Ceremony.This is a place where big business was held: Corrobborees, Initiation Ceremonies, Songline Ceremonies, trade and relationship building and a place where laws were made and passed.According to Tamiru, Ngannelong continues to play a role in Yung Balug culture:The mystique and spiritual essence of the rock has contributed to the story of our Dreaming which binds my people to our creator spirits and country.We Sing, Dance and Paint our Country forever.Settler colonialists dispossessed the Aboriginal owners and forced them out of the area. "One of the last initiation ceremonies may have been held there in November 1851 by a Wurundjeri elder from the Templestowe area" in the Yarra Valley. This ceremony was also attended by two young settlers' children, Willie Chivers, 11, and his younger brother Tom, 7, who were being cared for on a daily basis by the tribe after their mother had died. Their father went missing after looking for their mother.
An engraving made by William Blandowski in 1855/56 shows a group of Aboriginal people camped on the hillside. Another engraving by Robert Bruce published in an 1865 edition of The Illustrated Melbourne Post shows three Aboriginal figures in the foreground with Hanging Rock rising up in the background.
Community
Horse races have been held at Hanging Rock for over one hundred years; the Hanging Rock Racing Club holds two race meetings a year on New Year's Day and Australia Day (26 January).
The Friends of Hanging Rock, established in 1987, is a community group which holds events open to the public, such as planting days and wildlife tours.
In 2013, the Hanging Rock Action Group was formed by local residents to call for adequate community consultation about the Macedon Ranges Shire Council's proposal to build a 200-person conference centre and 100 bed hotel in the Eastern Paddock, adjacent to and very visible from the Rock. The anger by the local community over this issue led to 7 of 9 councillors being voted out in the following elections.
Hanging Rock is the centrepiece for the Hanging Rock Recreation Reserve, a public reserve managed by the Macedon Ranges Shire Council. The reserve includes a horse racing track, picnic grounds, creek, interpretation centre and cafe. The reserve is a habitat for endemic flora and fauna, including koalas, wallabies, possums, phascogales, wedge-tailed eagles and kookaburras.
There is also a "Picnic at Hanging Rock" costumed event held in February around Valentines Day, organized by Central Highlands Victorian Historical Group. Participants dress in Victorian or Edwardian attire and picnic at the base before climbing the Rock for photo opportunities.
The reserve is open to the public during daylight hours seven days a week. Entry is charged per vehicle. Camping is possible by arrangement.
Hanging Rock Reserve is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register as a place of historical, aesthetic and social significance to the State of Victoria.
Hanging Rock Reserve is currently under review by the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning to determine future governance and administrative arrangements for management of the site.
Treatments in novel and film
Hanging Rock was the inspiration and setting for the novel Picnic at Hanging Rock, written by Joan Lindsay and published in 1967. The novel dealt with the disappearance of a number of schoolgirls during a visit to the site. Their disappearance was explained in the final chapter, but Lindsay deleted this chapter at the suggestion of her editor, thinking the mystery was greater without it.
The novel inspired the film Picnic at Hanging Rock, made in 1975 and directed by Peter Weir. The success of the film was responsible for a substantial increase in visits to the rock and a renewal of interest in the novel. Yvonne Rousseau wrote a book called The Murders at Hanging Rock, published in 1980, which examined possible explanations for the disappearance of the girls.
The deleted final chapter of the novel was finally published in 1987 after the death of Joan Lindsay. Lindsay had given the copyright for the last chapter to her literary agent John Taylor on the understanding he would only publish it after her death. It was titled The Secret of Hanging Rock.
Concert venue
Hanging Rock reserve is currently used as an occasional outdoor concert venue by major international acts on the Australian leg of their tours.
The following events have taken place at Hanging Rock as part of a trial by Frontier Touring and the Macedon Ranges Shire Council:
Leonard Cohen – November 2010
Rod Stewart – February 2012
Bruce Springsteen – March 2013 (Wrecking Ball tour)
In 2014 the Rolling Stones were scheduled to play a night concert (30 March) at Hanging Rock as part of their "14 On Fire" tour. The death of Mick Jagger's partner, L'Wren Scott, resulted in the postponement of the entire tour. The tour was rescheduled and resumed in Adelaide on October 25, 2014. The Hanging Rock concert was rescheduled to take place on Saturday, November 8, 2014, but Rolling Stones lead Mick Jagger cancelled the concert due to a throat infection.
In October 2013 Frontier Touring signed a five-year agreement with the Macedon Ranges Shire Council to hold up to four concerts per year at Hanging Rock, effective from 31 October 2014.
Subsequent concerts have been:
The Eagles – February 2015 (History of the Eagles)
Rod Stewart – March 2015
Cold Chisel – November 2015
Ed Sheeran – February 2017
Bruce Springsteen – February 2017
Midnight Oil – November 2017
Elton John - January 2020 (Farewell Yellow Brick Road)

Rafinesquina is an extinct genus of large brachiopod that existed from the Darriwilian to the Ludlow epoch.
The genus was named in honor of polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque.
Description
Rafinesquina's members were epifaunal, meaning they lived on top of the seafloor, not buried within it, and were suspension feeders. Rafinesquina normally have a concavo-convex profile, with radiating striae of alternating size which are crossed with finer concentric striae. Their width is usually greater than their length, like most Strophomenids. Members of this genus had shells that grew in increments, with each increment forming a layer of the shell (much like trees do with their rings). In 1982, Gary D. Rosenberg analyzed specimens of Rafinesquina alternata previously inferred to have lived in a shallow subtidal environment and proposed it could be possible to estimate the total number of days in a lunar month (the period between full moons) during the Late Ordovician using layer counting.
Distribution
Rafinesquina specimens had a cosmopolitan distribution, and their fossils can be found in the Americas, Europe, and Asia.

The Kharkiv University or Karazin University (), or officially V. N. Karazin Kharkiv National University (), is one of the major universities in Ukraine, and earlier in the Russian Empire and Soviet Union. It was founded in 1804 through the efforts of Vasily Karazin becoming the second oldest university in modern-day Ukraine.
History
Russian Empire
On , the Decree on the Opening of the Imperial University in Kharkiv came into force. The university became the second university in the south of the Russian Empire. It was founded on the initiative of the local community with Vasily Karazin at the fore, whose idea was supported by the nobility and the local authorities. Count Seweryn Potocki was appointed the first supervisor of the university, the first rector being the philologist and philosopher Ivan Rizhsky.
In 1811, the Philotechnical Society was founded, while the Mathematical Society of Kharkiv, the Historical and Philological Society of Kharkiv, the Naturalists Society, Societies of Physics, Chemistry, Law, among others, were established in the second half of the 19th century. The first periodicals in Slobozhanshchyna appear in the university around this time, including Kharkovski Ezhenedelnik (1812), Ukrainski Vestnik (1816–1819), Ukrainski Zhurnal (1824–1825), etc.
In 1839, a veterinary school, which in 1851 became an independent institute, was established at the university. By this time, the campus included laboratories, clinics, an astronomical observatory, a botanical garden and a library.
Previously, the university was autonomous with rectors being elected. However, from 1820 to 1850, all its activity was strictly controlled. Rectors were appointed by the Minister of Education, while scientific publications and academic processes were censored.
In 1863, under a new Statute, the university became partly autonomous.
The university has been publishing Scientific Notes since 1874.
From the 19th century up to the early 20th century, the University of Kharkiv had four schools: School of Physics and Mathematics, School of History and Philology, School of Medicine, School of Law.
The university exerted great influence on school-life in Slobozhanshchyna in the first period of its existence, largely from 1805 to 1835.
Ukrainian SSR
From 1917 to 1920, there was a struggle between advocates of the Ukrainian statehood and Russian course. Some of the professors who opposed new political realities left. Most of the Ukrainian professors remained in Kharkiv. They continued working in the institutions founded by the Soviet government: the Academy of Theoretical Knowledge (1920–1921), Kharkiv Institute of Public Education (KhIPE, 1921–1930), Kharkiv Institute of National Economy, Institute of Physics and Chemistry, and Institute of Law. Kharkiv State University, consisting of seven schools — School of Physics and Mathematics, School of Chemistry, School of Biology, School of Geology and Geography, School of Literature and Linguistics (with Department of Philosophy), and School of Economy (with Department of Economic Geography) — was restored on their basis in 1932–1933.
In 1921, Kharkiv Medical Institute was founded based on the School of Medicine of the University of Kharkiv.
In 1936, the university was named after the late Russian writer Maxim Gorky (though he was not related to the university during his life). During the German-Soviet war, it was evacuated to the city of Kizilord in Kazakhstan, where it merged with the Kyiv University to form the United Ukrainian State University. In 1943/44, the university returned to Kharkiv (the first academic year after the liberation of the city on November 1, 1943). In 1951, 800 university students suffered from persecution after they refused to pass exams in Russian. Court trials were held behind closed doors.
In 1977, the following schools were operating in the university: School of Mechanics and Mathematics, School of Physics, School of Geology and Geography, School of Economy, School of History, School of Philology, School of Foreign Languages, School of General Sciences, School of Correspondence Learning, and Night School.
Independent Ukraine
On 11 October 1999, Leonid Kuchma, the President of Ukraine issued a decree, in which he, "taking into consideration considerable contribution that Kharkiv State University made to training qualified specialists and to development of science" granted the status of a national university and named it after its founder, Vasyl Karazin.
In 2004, the university was given a twin building (the former Govorov Academy), opposite Svobody Square.
In 2022, the university was severely damaged by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. On March 2, the Russian shelling hit the building of the Faculty of Economics and was subsequently destroyed by Russian shelling. On March 5 the university sports complex was partially destroyed. On March 11 — the building of the Faculty of Physics and Technology was partially destroyed and on March 18 — the Institute of Public Administration was partially ruined. As of March 22, according to the university's press service, the University had no intact buildings left.

The amazon, also known as the queen+knight compound, is a fairy chess piece that can move like a queen or a knight. It may thus be considered the sum of all orthodox chess pieces other than the king and the pawn. The amazon can force checkmate on an enemy king without the help of any other friendly piece.
Chess moves in this article use A as notation for the amazon.
Movement
The amazon's movement combines those of the queen and the knight. Thus, it may move to any square on the same rank, file, or diagonal as long as it does not jump, or it may move to any of the nearest squares not on the same rank, file, or diagonal.
History
The amazon is one of the most simply described fairy chess pieces and as such has a long history and has gone by many names. It was first used in Turkish Great Chess, a large medieval variant of chess, where it was called the giraffe. Later, it was widely experimented with in the Middle Ages to replace the slow ferz, and it competed with the modern queen for this role; the modern queen eventually won out because of the excessive power of the amazon. In Russia, the amazon persisted into the 18th century; some players disapproved of this ability to "gallop like the horse" (knight). The book A History of Chess by H. J. R. Murray, page 384, says that some Mr. Coxe, who was in Russia in 1772, saw chess being played with the amazon.
The amazon is most well-known for its appearance in the chess variant Maharajah and the Sepoys, where it is the maharajah. It is royal and White's only piece.
Value
The amazon's value is estimated to be 12-13 points in the chess piece relative value system, as the amazon is extremely mobile, can control every square surrounding itself in a 5×5 area, and can force checkmate by itself. In contrast, although the gryphon (or griffin) from Grande Acedrex (which moves one step diagonally before continuing outwards as a rook) would seem to have the value of two rooks (10–11 points), the squares it attacks are more dispersed, and it is more easily defended against than the amazon.
In the endgame of king and amazon versus king and empress (rook+knight compound), the amazon usually wins; however, in a few positions, the weaker side may force a draw by setting up a fortress. Such a fortress forces the side with the amazon to give perpetual check; otherwise, the side with the empress can force a simplification or give its own perpetual check. King and amazon versus king is a forced win for the side with the amazon; checkmate can be forced within four moves. In comparison, the queen requires 10 moves and the rook requires 16. In fact, the amazon does not even require its king's help to force checkmate (as an example of a checkmate position, the king is in the corner and the attacking amazon is a knight's move away from it), and this great power is the reason why it is not seen as often in chess variants as the princess or empress.
Symbol
Both white and black symbols for the amazon were added to version 12 of the Unicode standard in March 2019, in the Chess Symbols block:
🩎 U+1FA4E WHITE CHESS KNIGHT-QUEEN
🩑 U+1FA51 BLACK CHESS KNIGHT-QUEEN

Diasec is the registered trademark for the original method of face-mounting prints, such as photographs on acrylic sheet. The process was invented by Heinz Sovilla-Brulhart in 1969.
Because of the light penetration and refraction of clear acrylic compared to normal glass, the colours are more brilliant and the image sharper than with standard glass in a picture frame. A Diasec mount is usually of a high gloss finish. Because the print is glued to the acrylic glazing, the result is a completely flat mount of the image.
The print is also protected against ultraviolet (UV) light. Diasec contains UV light inhibitors to help protect the image from UV light.
Process
The process bonds the print without air bubbles, because it uses liquid gel instead of a transparent adhesive film. The image is face mounted and stuck to the acrylic glass with a special sealant. Normally the mounted print is then placed on a carrier sheet. This is usually Aluminium. If the print has to be backlit, translucent materials such as acrylic can be used instead.
The Diasec gel is neutral curing and has an inbuilt ultra violet filter. It contains no plasticisers and is resistant to fungicidal, bacterial agents, and airborne pollutants. After curing, the whole airtight panel remains chemically inert and stable. The finished product remains flexible, enabling it to withstand changes in temperature and humidity, which affect works on paper. However, the process is irreversible and if the acrylic glass is damaged there is no way to salvage the print.
Nowadays, new Acrylic products can include anti scratch surface coatings that prevent damage to these pieces of art.
Uses
The Diasec process is mostly used by artists and photographers to present their artwork. Andreas Gursky mounted "99 Cent II Diptychon", the most expensive photograph ever, on acrylic glass, probably with the Diasec process.
Diasec panels are backed with aluminium or dibond, reinforcing the rigidity of the finished picture and sealing the artwork from both sides.
The Aluminium back also enables the attachment of sub-frames that allow the artwork to hang on the wall without a traditional picture frame.
Diasec samples that were made in the 1970s show negligible colour shift, the whites are still pure and there is no evidence of acid erosion visible.
Diasec patent
In the past the process was patented by the Swiss company Alrane Inventing AG in order to generate a brandname for the official licensee. To this day that same process is only available to official license holders. The diasec patent has expired and a surrogate process is used by some mounting studios. However they cannot use the genuine Diasec ingredients or machinery.
The Dutch company "Diasec Support BV", was started in 2009 to support the Swiss licensor by offering training and custom made machines. Special fluids needed for the Diasec process are only available from the Swiss originators.

HMS Vixen was an armoured composite gunboat, the only ship of her class, and the third ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name. She was the first Royal Navy vessel to have twin propellers.
Design
Designed by the Admiralty, Vixen was a half-sister to and , and all three were built mostly as experimental vessels. While Viper and Vixen were twin screw vessels, Waterwitch had a water-pump propulsion system. Viper differed from Vixen mainly in her iron construction.
Hull
Vixen was an armoured gunboat of the breastwork type. Her hull was of composite construction, with iron frames and iron bulwarks, but with an outer cladding of teak over the entire hull. An armoured citadel protected her machinery and the ram bow was reinforced by massive ironwork structures. Underwater, her hull was sheathed in copper to prevent marine growth. Vertical trunks were provided at the stern to lift the screws clear of the hull, thereby allowing a better hull-form for purely wind-driven sailing.
Propulsion
She was equipped with two sets of 4-cylinder horizontal single-expansion steam engines, each set powering one of her two-bladed, 9 ft diameter Maudslay & Griffiths screws. In total she developed an indicated 740 horsepower, sufficient for a top speed of . Steam was provided by two Maudslay iron fire-tube boilers with six furnaces.
Sail plan
She was equipped with a barquentine rig, but in 1873 all masts, rigging and upper deck obstructions were removed after the decision for Vixen and Viper to remain permanently in Bermuda.
Armament
Vixen was armed with two 7-inch (6½-ton) muzzle-loading rifled guns and two 20-pounder breech-loading rifled guns. One of Vixen or Vipers 7-inch guns was displayed on the waterfront at St George's as recently as 1991.
Construction
Vixen was ordered from Charles Lungley of Deptford on 22 March 1864 and laid down the same year. She was launched on 18 November 1865 and commissioned in 1866 under Commander Spencer Phipps Brett for comparative trials. Her total cost was £54,193.
Career
Vixen, Viper, and Waterwitch conducted comparative trials at Stokes Bay during the late 1860s. Although turning ability was impressive, none of the ships attained more than in an era when it could achieve . Furthermore, Vixen was nearly lost in the Irish Channel during a winter gale in 1876, making her unsuitable for the open sea under steam or sail. Vixen and Viper were towed to Bermuda in 1868 where they operated within the reefline as floating defensive batteries, extending the defences of the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda.
In July 1869, both ships were employed to bring the floating dock Bermuda from The Narrows to the dockyard, and in 1870, Vixen rescued a disabled barque. 1873 saw the loss of all rigging, masts and upperdeck equipment, and this must have helped her to survive the 1878 hurricane which caused serious damage to the floating dock and other dockyard facilities. In 1895, she was used as an accommodation hulk for dockyard labourers and in 1895 listed as 'to be sold' in the Navy List.
The Daniel's Head Channel Act (1887) had authorised the sinking of a blockship to close the channel, but the Hydrographer's Report of 1888 declared the approaches from that direction safe from attack. By December 1895, Vixen had been sold to a local scrap merchant. In 1896, Vice-Admiral James Erskine recommended the channel be covered by shore batteries against torpedo boat attack, and in order to make such boats pass close to Daniel's Head, Vixen was sunk in the channel, probably the same year.
Fate
Once her engines had been removed, she was placed across the Chubb Cut and massive scuttling charges were detonated. Her keel was broken, and she settled in her final resting place. Vixen now lies in of water about offshore from Daniel's Head, at the west end of Bermuda. She lies in a narrow gap in the coral reef, with the bow just above water. She is well known locally and is often visited by glass-bottomed boats and divers, having become something of a tourist attraction. The wreck is visible on satellite imagery in position .
Investigation of the wreck
In 1986, Professor Richard Gould began his investigation of the wreck with volunteers from EarthWatch and support from the Bermuda Maritime Museum. By 1988, they had amassed 13 weeks of diving at the site, and in 1991 Gould published "The Archaeology of HMS Vixen, an early ironclad ram in Bermuda" in The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology, giving a comprehensive account of the construction, history and fate of the ship.

John Fergushill (1592–1644), was a 17th-century Minister of the Church of Scotland who supported the 1638 National Covenant and was an associate of Presbyterian fundamentalists, including Archibald Johnson. He died on 11 June 1644.
Life
John Fergushill was born in 1592, the only son of David Fergushill, merchant and Provost or Chief Magistrate of Ayr and Janet Kennedy. He began his studies at Edinburgh University in 1601, at the age of nine but an outbreak of plague resulted in him being sent to complete his studies in France. In 1604, his father wrote to a family connection, Robert Boyd, then Professor of Philosophy at the French Huguenot university of Montauban, asking him to supervise John's schooling.
However, he spent the next year studying in Bordeaux, before returning to Scotland in 1605; in a letter of 29 December 1608 to Boyd, he explains the delays in his schooling as due to 'the weakness of my body and especially my eyes.' This was clearly successful, since he completed his degree in Theology at the University of Glasgow and appointed Church of Scotland minister at Ochiltree in 1614. He is recorded as having completed his qualification as a minister and being certified by the Presbytery in Glasgow in September 1616.
Fergushill married twice, first to Agnes Eccles, then to Annabel Wallace. He died in Ayr on 11 June 1644, aged about 52.
Background and Career
Fergushill was ordained at a time of intense conflict over religion; the 1562-1598 French Wars of Religion caused over three million deaths from war and disease, followed by the 1618-1648 Thirty Years' War, one of the most destructive conflicts in recorded history, with an estimated eight million deaths. In Britain, similar arguments over religious practices would ultimately lead to the 1638-1652 Wars of the Three Kingdoms.
Like most Scots, James VI was a Calvinist but he favoured rule by bishops or Episcopalian governance as a means of control; when he also became King of England in 1603, he saw a unified Church of Scotland and England as the first step towards a centralised, Unionist state. However, the Church of England was very different from the kirk in both governance and doctrine and even Scottish bishops viewed many English practices as essentially Catholic.
On 10 March 1615, John Ogilvie, a Scottish Jesuit convert, was executed in Glasgow; his 'fall' was of particular concern, since he came from an upper class, Calvinist Scots family and studied at the Protestant University of Helmstedt before his conversion. It fuelled the debate over James' proposed reforms or the Five Articles of Perth, particularly the re-introduction of kneeling; while only a minority viewed this as idolatry, many others argued that Olgivie demonstrated the danger of such 'Popish' practices, even for the educated devout.
In 1618, the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland reluctantly approved the Articles but they were widely resented. Fergushill was actively involved in this debate and in March 1620, he and 48 other ministers were summoned to appear before the Scottish High Commission, an ecclesiastical court of bishops and sympathetic ministers established to enforce the Articles. The accused were found guilty but all denied the authority of the Court to discipline them; Robert Boyd wrote to the Court on Fergushill's behalf, urging clemency.
Fergushill was allowed to return to Ochiltree, on condition that he not administer Communion to his congregation, a restriction that was ignored; he remained there until 1639, when he transferred to Ayr. He was an associate of radicals like Archibald Johnson who formulated the 1638 National Covenant and part of the General Assembly that expelled bishops from the kirk and led to the 1638-1639 Bishop's Wars.

Yashovarman (IAST: Yaśovarman; reigned c. 1164-1165 CE), also called Yashovarman II to distinguish him from the earlier Yashovarman I, was a member of the Chandela dynasty of central India. He is believed to have ruled the Jejakabhukti region (Bundelkhand in present-day Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh) for a short period.
Yashovarman was a son of the Chandela king Madanavarman. He is mentioned in the Bateshvar inscription of his own son Paramardi-deva, but other Chandela inscriptions do not mention his name in the list of Chandela kings. According to historian S. K. Mitra, the Bateshvar inscription clearly indicates that Yashovarman ascended the Chandela throne, even if for a very short period. It describes Yashovarman as "an ornament of great rulers causing joy to the people". Mitra theorizes that the other inscriptions omit his name because his short reign did not see any notable achievement.
Historian R. K. Dikshit, on the other hand, believes that the epithet "ornament of great rulers" is mere rhetoric. There is hardly any difference between the last known date of Yashovarman's father Madanavarman (1063 CE) and the earliest known date of his son Paramardi-deva (1066 CE). The inscriptions other than the Bateshvar inscription, including those issued by Paramardi, suggest that Paramardi succeeded Madanvarman. It is possible that Yashovarman died while his father Madanvarman was still alive.
According to the medieval legendary text Paramala Raso, Paramardi ascended the Chandela throne at the age of 5 years, which suggests that Yashovarman died prematurely.

Charles Sheldon Hastings (November 27, 1848 – January 31, 1932) was an American physicist known for his work in optics. His father was Panet Marshall Hastings and his mother was Jane Sheldon Hastings. The father was a physician and anatomy teacher at Hamilton College, New York, where Charles was born. At the age of six the family moved to Hartford, Connecticut, where Charles received his early education. Hastings entered Yale University's Sheffield School of Science in 1867 and received his bachelor's degree in 1870. His early interest in astronomy and telescopes were likely due to Chester Lyman, Chair of Physics and Astronomy at the Sheffield School. He then earned a PhD from Yale in 1873, and immediately was made an instructor in physics. In 1875 he resigned to study in Germany and France until being named an associate at the new Johns Hopkins University in 1876. He became an associate professor of physics at Johns Hopkins University and the first Chair of Professor of Physics of Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University. He collaborated with John A. Brashear on the optical design of large telescopes including the reflector at Dominion Astrophysical Observatory and the photographic refractor at Allegheny Observatory. His optical designs enabled much progress in astronomy at U.S. observatories. The Hastings Triplet magnifying glass design is based on his optical formulae. He was awarded the Elliott Cresson Medal in 1926.
In 1878 Hastings married Elizabeth Tracy Smith and they remained together for more than fifty years, until Elizabeth died in 1930 after a long illness. After the death of his wife, Hastings himself declined rapidly and died in January 1932. He was a member of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1898, Hastings co-authored, with Frederick E. Beach, a textbook entitled A Text-Book of General Physics, which has been characterized as "difficult." It was considered an excellent text for those already enamored with physics but a bad one for those not so enthusiastic about the subject. One copy of this book, apparently once owned by a less enthusiastic student, reportedly contains the inscribed verse, "If we should have another flood | For safety hither fly | Although the earth would be submerged | This book would still be dry."

Fort Hill is a hill that once existed on Darwin Harbour in the Northern Territory of Australia. It was the location of George Goyder's survey camp which was established in 1869.
Colonial history
The hill became the earliest European burial site in Darwin, after the death and burial of John William Ogilvie Bennett, a draughtsman on Goyder's 1869 survey expedition. Bennett was fatally speared by Aboriginal people on the Adelaide River on 24 May 1869, dying four days later. He and a fellow expedition member were attacked at their camp, while compiling an atlas of Wulna place-names. He was buried at a site on the top of Fort Hill. Another early settler Richard Hazard was the next person to be buried there. Hazard died there on 2 August 1869. Their remains were relocated to Darwin Cemetery on McMillians Road in 1965.
During World War II Fort Hill had two oil tunnels bored into the side of the hill.
The hill was removed in 1965 to make way for the iron-ore loading wharf.

Alastair Charles Lewis (Ally Lewis) is a professor of Atmospheric Chemistry at the University of York and a Science Director at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS). He is currently Chair of the UK Government independent science advisory group on air pollution, the Defra Air Quality Expert Group.
Lewis became Chair of the Department for Transport Science Advisory Council in 2021.
Education
Lewis attended Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School, Rochester, and then studied chemistry at the University of Leeds followed by a PhD in atmospheric and analytical chemistry supervised by Prof. Mike Pilling CBE and Prof. Keith Bartle, awarded in 1995.
Research and career
He is known for his development of analytical chemistry methods that are applied to air pollution monitoring and atmospheric chemistry research, and particularly the use of gas chromatography to measure volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and the composition of liquid fuels such as gasoline and diesel. He was the first person to use comprehensive gas chromatography (GCxGC) to establish the complexity of volatile organic compounds found in urban air, completed whilst on a research sabbatical at RMIT University, Australia. He held a lecturer position at the University of Leeds, as a joint appointment between the Schools of Chemistry and Earth & Environment before later moving to the Department of Chemistry at University of York in 2003. He currently works in the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories at York.
Between 2007 and 2012 Lewis worked part-time for the Natural Environment Research Council as their Theme Leader for research programmes in new technologies. In 2008 he was appointed as Director for Atmospheric Composition at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, and he remains one of three science directors, with specific responsibility for air pollution research.
Lewis has been a member of the Defra Air Quality Expert Group (AQEG) since 2012 and has published a number of commentary articles on air pollution science and policy in the UK, US and China. He has also made a number of appearances on TV and radio discussing vehicle emissions and indoor air pollution. He has been widely quoted as skeptical about the value of air pollution removal schemes such as smog towers and roadside filter systems, and raised concerns about the wider environmental impacts of air filtration.
He has collaborated with Dr Peter Edwards at York to evaluate low cost air pollution sensor technologies and with Professor David Carslaw on diesel engine NOx emissions. Although primarily a chemist, he was named in a 2015 list of the World's 100 most influential analytical scientists. His research career was documented by the Science History Institute in 2011, part of series of interviews with atmospheric scientists.
Awards and honours
Lewis was awarded the Desty Memorial Prize in separation science at the Royal Institution in 2001, a Philip Leverhulme Prize in 'Earth Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences' in 2004, the SAC Silver Medal in 2007 from the Royal Society of Chemistry, and the John Jeyes Award for Environment, Energy and Sustainability in 2012.

The title of Coroners Court is the name given to proceedings in which a coroner holds an inquest or an inquiry in the Northern Territory.
Jurisdiction
Coroners have jurisdiction over the remains of a person and the power to make findings in respect of the cause of death of a person. In the territory, they also have power to hold inquests into disasters that occur wholly or partly in the territory.
Generally there are no appeals from the decision of a coroner, although there is provision for the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory to order a fresh inquest or inquiry or to grant prerogative relief in respect of the proceedings.
History
The office of coroner in the territory derives from the legal framework of the office of coroner inherited from the United Kingdom when Australia was settled by the British in 1788.
The first Governor of New South Wales, Arthur Phillip, was a coroner by virtue of his commission as governor. Technically, he was the first coroner of the territory as the territory was part of New South Wales at that time. Practically however, he had no presence there, and no need to exercise jurisdiction.
The governor's commission also entitled him to appoint others as coroners as required, and this was most likely to have been to justices of the peace.
Structure and jurisdiction
The Administrator of the Northern Territory may appoint a Territory Coroner for the territory. The Territory Coroner has the function to oversee and co-ordinate coronial services in the territory, ensure that all deaths and suspected deaths concerning which a coroner has jurisdiction to hold an inquest properly investigated, ensuring that an inquest or inquiry is held whenever it is required, and to issue guidelines to coroners to assist them in the exercise or performance of their functions.
The administrator may also appoint deputy coroners. Deputy coroners essentially have all the functions of a coroner except that they cannot hold an inquest into a death in custody.
All stipendiary magistrates in the territory are coroners by virtue of their appointment as a magistrate.

Saint Veronica, also known as Berenike, was a woman from Jerusalem who lived in the 1st century AD, according to extra-biblical Christian sacred tradition. A celebrated saint in many pious Christian countries, the 17th-century Acta Sanctorum published by the Bollandists listed her feast under July 12, but the German Jesuit scholar Joseph Braun cited her commemoration in Festi Marianni on 13 January.
According to Church tradition, Veronica was moved with sympathy seeing Jesus carrying the cross to Calvary and gave him her veil so that he could wipe his forehead. Jesus accepted the offer, and when he returned the veil the image of his face was miraculously captured on it. The resulting relic became known as the Veil of Veronica.
The story of Veronica is celebrated in the sixth Station of the Cross in many Anglican, Catholic, and Western Orthodox churches.
Background
There is no reference to the story of Veronica and her veil in the canonical gospels. The closest is the miracle of the unnamed woman who was healed by touching the hem of Jesus's garment (Luke 8:43–48). The apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus gives her name as Berenikē or Beronike (). The name Veronica is a Latinisation of this ancient Macedonian name. The story was later elaborated in the 11th century by adding that Christ gave her a portrait of himself on a cloth, with which she later cured the Emperor Tiberius. The linking of this with the bearing of the cross in the Passion occurs only around 1380 in the internationally popular book Meditations on the life of Christ.
At some point a relic became associated with the story. Pedro Tafur, a Spanish knight visiting Rome in 1436, describes the following in the Church of St. Peter in his 1454 travel account:
However, he does not say specifically that he witnessed for himself this exhibition of the relic.
Some academic sources suggest a different origin for the legend of St. Veronica: that the cloth bearing an image of Jesus's face was known in Latin as the vera icon ("true image"), and that this name for the relic was misinterpreted as the name of a saint. The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913 writes:
The reference to Abgar is related to a similar legend in the Eastern Church, the Image of Edessa or Mandylion.
The Encyclopædia Britannica says this about the legend:
Veronica was mentioned in the reported visions of Jesus by Marie of St Peter, a Carmelite nun who lived in Tours, France, and started the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus. In 1844, Sister Marie reported that in a vision, she saw Veronica wiping away the spit and mud from the face of Jesus with her veil on the way to Calvary. She said that sacrilegious and blasphemous acts today are adding to the spit and mud that Veronica wiped away that day. According to Marie of St Peter, in her visions, Jesus told her that he desired devotion to His Holy Face in reparation for sacrilege and blasphemy. Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ are thus compared to Veronica wiping the face of Jesus.
The Devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus was eventually approved by Pope Leo XIII in 1885. Veronica is commemorated on 12 July.
Official patronage
Saint Veronica is the patron of the French mulquiniers whose representations they celebrated biannually (summer and winter) as in many pious Christian countries. She is also the patron saint of photographers, and laundry workers.
In popular culture
In Volume 5 of her work, The Poem of the Man-God, Italian writer and alleged mystic Maria Valtorta depicts Veronica as Nike, who offered the linen cloth to Christ. It is also stated earlier in the same volume that "The one we call Veronica and whom Jesus called Nike..." suggesting that Nike has been mistakenly referred to as Veronica throughout history.
Selma Lagerlöf in Christ Legends expands the legend by making Veronica a former servant of the Roman emperor Tiberius, named Faustina, who travels to Jerusalem in search of the Prophet of Nazareth, after learning that he once cured a young woman of leprosy. She travels on behalf of Tiberius, now himself stricken, hoping to bring him a cure and redemption from his evil ways. Faustina arrives on the day of the Crucifixion, and the rest is legend.
Mel Gibson's film The Passion of the Christ (2004) included an episode of Veronica wiping Jesus's face, although she is not referred to by name in the film (she is credited in the film as Seraphia). Anne Catherine Emmerich, one of the inspirational sources to the cited movie, depicts a long description of the Veronica episode and she identifies the true name of Veronica also as Seraphia.
The most common pass with the cape in bullfighting is called a verónica, as the torero holds the cape in the same way as Veronica is usually depicted holding the cloth.
The song "Climb" by Tori Amos on her 2017 album Native Invader contains repeated references to Veronica.

Monika Charlotte Dannemann (24 June 19455 April 1996) was a German figure skater and painter. She was the last girlfriend of guitarist Jimi Hendrix, and later the wife of German guitarist Uli Jon Roth of the Scorpions.
Figure skating
In 1965, Dannemann participated in the German Figure Skating Championships representing the club Düsseldorfer EG.
Involvement with Jimi Hendrix
Dannemann was first introduced to Jimi Hendrix on 12 January 1969, in Düsseldorf, after being invited to a Jimi Hendrix concert there. She spent that night with him and part of the next day too, when she accompanied him to his next concert in Cologne; after that, she returned to Düsseldorf. He spent the last night of the tour with model Uschi Obermaier, with whom he was filmed kissing and petting outside the Kempinski Hotel the next morning. He wrote to Dannemann on 25 March 1969, inviting her to visit him in New York City. Dannemann claims she next saw Hendrix when she travelled to London on 25 April 1969 in the hope of meeting him again, where she bumped into him at the Speakeasy Club. She says they spent some time together over the next nine days, but she only spent one night with him.
After his September 1970 European tour, Hendrix began a relationship with the Danish model Kirsten Nefer. (It was reported in the Danish press at the time that they were engaged.) After Nefer left London due to work, he again took up with Dannemann on 15 September and spent the next four nights at her flat at the Samarkand Hotel, Notting Hill Gate, where he died.
On the evening of 17 September Hendrix took at least one amphetamine pill (known as a "black bomber") at a party, where he stayed for a short while. Later, at Dannemann's flat, Hendrix took nine of her Vesparax sleeping tablets; Hendrix was officially declared to have died at St. Mary Abotts hospital at 12:45 PM. The cause of death was asphyxiation through aspiration of vomit due to a barbiturate overdose.
Later years
After Hendrix's death, Dannemann became romantically involved with German rock guitarist Uli Jon Roth of rock band Scorpions, with whom she collaborated on several songs (one with Scorpions titled We'll Burn the Sky), album cover designs (of Roth's second band Electric Sun), and artwork. Roth also wrote the foreword to Dannemann's book about her experience living and working with Hendrix, entitled The Inner World of Jimi Hendrix (1995).
Dannemann died of suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning at age 50 in Seaford, East Sussex. She had lost an ongoing court battle with another of Hendrix's girlfriends, Kathy Etchingham, two days earlier.

"What It Feels Like" is a song by American rappers Nipsey Hussle and Jay-Z, from the soundtrack to the film Judas and the Black Messiah. It was sent to rhythmic contemporary radio on February 16, 2021, four days after the film was released.
Background
The beat of the song was produced in 2013, by Rance and MyGuyMars of 1500 or Nothin'. Horns were added to it in 2015. In 2017, strings were added to the instrumental and Nipsey Hussle recorded the hook of the song. The song was further recorded by Hit-Boy amidst the George Floyd protests.
"What It Feels Like" was originally a song recorded by Mississippi rapper Tito Lopez. Hussle's lyrics in the song were written as a featured verse. Jay-Z's verse replaced that of Lopez's and was written specifically for Judas and the Black Messiah.
NBA player LeBron James previewed the song on February 10, 2021, two days before the song was released from the soundtrack to the film.
The song opens with Nipsey Hussle rapping a verse about surviving as a rapper, also mentioning selling his mixtape Crenshaw. In the next verse, Jay-Z briefly name-drops Canadian rapper Drake and record producer 40. He then criticizes the 2021 United States Capitol attack and the manner in which white insurrectionists were treated. Jay-Z also notes being born on the same day that Fred Hampton was assassinated, a fact which he previously mentioned in the song "Murder to Excellence".

The Chamber of Deputies () is the lower house of the bicameral Italian Parliament (the other being the Senate of the Republic). The two houses together form a perfect bicameral system, meaning they perform identical functions, but do so separately. The Chamber of Deputies has 630 members. Pursuant to the amended article 56 of the Italian Constitution, the Chamber of Deputies will have 400 seats following the next election, of which 392 will be elected from Italian constituencies, and 8 from Italian citizens living abroad. Deputies are styled The Honourable (Italian: Onorevole) and meet at Palazzo Montecitorio.
Location
The seat of the Chamber of Deputies is the Palazzo Montecitorio, where it has met since 1871, shortly after the capital of the Kingdom of Italy was moved to Rome at the successful conclusion of the Italian unification Risorgimento movement.
Previously, the seat of the Chamber of Deputies of the Kingdom of Italy had been briefly at the Palazzo Carignano in Turin (1861–1865) and the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence (1865–1871). Under the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini, the Chamber of Deputies was abolished and replaced by the figurehead Chamber of Fasces and Corporations from 1939 to 1943 (during World War II).
Normal operation
The Chamber is composed of all members meeting in session at the Montecitorio. The assembly also has the right to attend meetings of the Government and its ministers. If required, the Government is obligated to attend the session. Conversely, the Government has the right to be heard every time it requires.
The term of office of the House (as well as the Senate) is five years, but can be extended in two cases:
The "prorogatio", as provided by art. 61.2 of the Constitution, states that deputies whose terms have expired shall continue to exercise their functions until the first meeting of the new Chamber.
An extension of the term, provided for by art. 60.2, can be enacted only in case of war.
Electoral system
The electoral system is a mixed-member majoritarian with 37% of seats allocated using first-past-the-post voting (FPTP) and 63% using proportional representation, allocated with the largest remainder method, with one round of voting.
The 630 deputies are elected in:
232 in single-member constituencies, by plurality;
386 in multi-member constituencies, by national proportional representation;
12 in multi-member abroad constituencies, by constituency proportional representation.
For Italian residents, each house members are elected by single ballots, including the constituency candidate and his supporting party lists. In each single-member constituency the deputy/senator is elected on a plurality basis, while the seats in multi-member constituencies will be allocated nationally. In order to be calculated in single-member constituency results, parties need to obtain at least 1% of the national vote. In order to receive seats in multi-member constituencies, parties need to obtain at least 3% of the national vote. Elects from multi-member constituencies will come from closed lists.
The single voting paper, containing both first-past-the-post candidates and the party lists, shows the names of the candidates to single-member constituencies and, in close conjunction with them, the symbols of the linked lists for the proportional part, each one with a list of the relative candidates.
The voter can cast his vote in three different ways:
Drawing a sign on the symbol of a list: in this case the vote extends to the candidate in the single-member constituency which is supported by that list.
Drawing a sign on the name of the candidate of the single-member constituency and another one on the symbol of one list that supports them: the result is the same as that described above; it is not allowed, under penalty of annulment, the panachage, so the voter can not vote simultaneously for a candidate in the FPTP constituency and for a list which is not linked to them.
Drawing a sign only on the name of the candidate for the FPTP constituency, without indicating any list: in this case, the vote is valid for the candidate in the single-member constituency and also automatically extended to the list that supports them; if that candidate is however connected to several lists, the vote is divided proportionally between them, based on the votes that each one has obtained in that constituency.
Article 61 of the Italian Constitution maintains that elections for the Chamber of Deputies must take place within 70 days of the dissolution of the house, and that representatives must convene within 20 days of those elections.
President
The President of the Chamber of Deputies (Presidente della Camera dei Deputati) performs the role of speaker of the house and is elected during the first session after the election. During this time the prerogatives of speaker are assumed by the vice president of Chamber of Deputies of the previous legislature who was elected first. If two were elected simultaneously, the oldest deputy serves as president of Chamber of Deputies.
The President of Chamber of Deputies has also the role of President during the Parliament joint sessions, when the upper and lower houses have to vote together.
Roberto Fico is the current president of the Chamber of Deputies.
Membership
The Chamber has 630 members. They were most recently elected at the 2018 general election.
Reform proposals
In 2019, the Italian parliament passed a constitutional law that reduces the number of the deputies from 630 to 400. The law was approved on 21 and 22 September 2020 by a referendum. The Legislature XIX of Italy will be the first one in which the complexive number of Deputies will be equal to 400.

Nicole Sanchez, better known as Neekolul, is an American Twitch streamer and TikTok personality. In March 2020, her popularity online rose when she uploaded a TikTok featuring her lip syncing to the song "Oki Doki Boomer" while wearing a Bernie 2020 crop top; this TikTok was a direct reference to the "OK boomer" Internet meme that was popularized in late 2019. In July 2020, she was signed as a content creator for the gaming organization 100 Thieves.
Online career
Overview
Sanchez is primarily a Twitch streamer and partner, having created her "neeko" Twitch account in October 2017. As she is bilingual, Neekolul streams in both English and Spanish. According to social media analytics firm Social Blade, her account has received over 278,000 followers and over 3.84 million views as of November 4, 2020. She decided to become a Twitch streamer in particular due to the convenience of the medium; unlike content creators on YouTube, Twitch streamers' content is unedited, allowing her to dedicate adequate time to her studies. She streamed Call of Duty early in her career, but eventually switched over to streaming Fortnite.
OK Boomer video and reception (2020)
On March 2, 2020, Sanchez went viral online after she posted a TikTok video lip syncing and dancing to the Senzawa song "Oki Doki Boomer" while wearing a Bernie 2020 shirt. The caption of the video read "Like to trigger the BOOMERS #bernie2020." The video and its caption were referencing the OK boomer Internet meme that was popularized by Gen Z individuals and used to criticize the Baby boomer generation. It received over 6 million views in 4 days on TikTok. It was later removed due to a copyright takedown, although the song's artist stated she was not responsible for the copyright strike. On Twitter, the video has received over 30 million views. The video was met with mixed reactions, with users divided over whether the video was cute and charming, or "cringeworthy". Kotaku commented that "the video is mesmerizing in a way that makes you feel a small amount of secondhand embarrassment. In it, Neekolul performs a hyper-feminine and cutesy series of dance movements, with the results bordering on cloying. It's a subtle balancing act between irony and sincerity that TikTok's most popular video makers have mastered." In April, The Daily Dot ranked "'Oki Doki Boomer' TikTok memes" at 12th on their list of "the best memes of 2020".
It has since been noted by various media publications that Sanchez is a supporter of Bernie Sanders and his 2020 U.S. presidential campaign. The official TikTok account for Sanders' campaign also commented on the video, and Sanchez stated that the campaign's head of social media reached out to her to collaborate. Uploaded a day prior to the Democratic Party presidential primaries on Super Tuesday, many online users claimed that Sanchez's video had an adverse effect on Sanders' performance in primary voting. She stated, however, "I don't think I'm a huge driver of votes or anything, but I think the content creators and Internet culture as a whole can bring awareness to things like this."
Following her increase in popularity, it became apparent that much of her online fanbase were following her for ulterior motives; a significant amount of engagement on her content were users' attempts to flirt or describe their physical attraction to her. This garnered Neekolul the nickname "Queen of Simps", in reference to the slang term simp, someone who does way too much for a person they like, often in service of unreciprocated sexual feelings. After Sanchez revealed she has a boyfriend, she lost over 65,000 Twitter followers within 48 hours. She has since stated she said this as entertainment for her viewers; Kotaku wrote that "like many of her fans, she's constantly dancing on the impossibly blurry line between irony and sincerity."
Twitch streaming and content creation (2020–present)
She has since continued to upload content online. Her Twitter account was briefly suspended as a result of her content being flagged by false copyright claims. One of her subsequent TikTok videos featured her dancing along to the song "Mia Khalifa", which drew several comparisons to Belle Delphine's similar 2019 video. Her streaming style has been compared to Imane Anys. In April, Kotaku commented on her streams, stating that "even as she's blown up, in her streams she continues to behave in a way that feels accessible and inviting, verging on bubbly. That is not to say, however, that she doesn't know what she's doing." The outlet added that her notoriety as a personality and streamer was growing, rather than "just as a meme." Later that month, she signed with Night Media, a content management company.
After signing with Night Media, Tubefilter reported that she began planning to branch out on YouTube and had a product line in development. In July 2020, she joined the roster of American lifestyle brand and esports organization 100 Thieves as a content creator. In 2021, she was one of twelve contenders in the third edition of the PogChamps tournament organized by Chess.com and was the winner of the consolation bracket.
In June 2021, she released a YouTube video called "$2,000,000 Apartment Tour" which drew heavy criticism and overwhelming dislikes on the video for alleged hypocrisy. She had previously defended herself against accusations of hypocrisy by saying of the "Tax the rich" slogan seen on her AOC sweater: "I think when people mean like, 'Tax the rich,' I think at the end of the day they do mean, like, billionaires and people who have insane, unfathomable amounts of wealth".
Media reception
Nathan Grayson of Kotaku surmised on Sanchez's popularity, stating that "the cutesiness of Neekolul's recent videos and her relative proximity to so-called 'egirls' like Belle Delphine has given rise to accusations that the fans who find her attractive are people who want women to behave in ways that are child-like, naive, or foolish." Gita Jackson of Vice similarly wrote on Neekolul's appeal, stating that "like so many objects of male attention before her, her mere presence as a human being will either cause you to simp or to shun. But she's just followed a formula that's been thrust upon young, attractive women since men have been able to gawk at them." Jackson added that, "Some of [Neekolul's] critics say that by wearing a cosplay school uniform, dancing, and talking like a sexy baby, she is reinforcing negative stereotypes about women and encouraging men attracted to women to indulge in a fetish for seeing them infantilized."
Personal life and legal issues
Sanchez is of mostly Indigenous American and European descent. Her family immigrated to California from Mexico. She formerly studied business and marketing in college.
In 2018, Sanchez was arrested and spent a night in jail for corporal injury, which is a domestic violence charge. In a statement released in March 2021, Sanchez said that she had been a victim of domestic abuse, including physical beatings, by her former partner for seven years. According to her statement, her arrest stemmed from an incident in which she struck her former partner after confronting him about his behavior at his house near the end of their relationship. She was charged with felony domestic violence but entered a plea agreement in which she agreed to follow a 12 week anger management course, in exchange she had her charges reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor. After completing the 12 week program her case was dismissed under the condition she has no new arrests based on probable cause in the next 12 months. Sanchez's statement attracted support from other popular content creators such as Keemstar, Imane Anys, and Anna Rudolf, as well as pushback from fellow streamer Destiny, who commented that if Sanchez was male, the response to the statement about hitting an ex-partner would have been more negative.

Inferential Theory of Learning (ITL) is an area of machine learning which describes inferential processes performed by learning agents. ITL has been continuously developed by Ryszard S. Michalski, starting in the 1980s. The first known publication of ITL was in 1983. In ITL learning process is viewed as a search (inference) through hypotheses space guided by a specific goal. Results of learning need to be stored. Stored information will later be used by the learner for future inferences. Inferences are split into multiple categories including conclusive, deduction, and induction. In order for an inference to be considered complete it was required that all categories must be taken into account. This is how the ITL varies from other machine learning theories like Computational Learning Theory and Statistical Learning Theory; which both use singular forms of inference.
Usage
The most relevant published usage of ITL was in scientific journal published in 2012 and used ITL as a way to describe how agent-based learning works. According to the journal "The Inferential Theory of Learning (ITL) provides an elegant way of describing learning processes by agents".

Human rights in Romania are generally respected by the government. However, there have been concerns regarding allegations of police brutality, mistreatment of the Romani minority, government corruption, poor prison conditions, and compromised judicial independence. Romania was ranked 59th out of 167 countries in the 2015 Democracy Index and is described as a "flawed democracy", similar to other countries in Central or Eastern Europe.
Corruption and institutional abuses
Corruption in Romania is a serious systemic problem, according to the anti-corruption report of the EC. Although the anti-corruption struggle has seen an upward trend in recent years, and the investigations of the National Anticorruption Directorate (NAD) have led to a former prime minister's trial in 2015 and other important public representatives, corruption still affects many aspects of life. The US Department of State's report on human rights practices highlights that bribes has remained an ordinary thing in the public sector. Romania and Bulgaria are the only EU members monitored through the Mechanism for Cooperation and Verification. The MCV was established at the time Romania joined the European Union in 2007 to remedy the shortcomings of judicial reform and the fight against corruption.
Although there have been significant improvements, corruption remains an issue, affecting many areas of life. Despite the fact that Romanian law and regulations contain provisions intended to prevent corruption, enforcement has generally been weak until recently. The image of Romania was badly affected by the 2012 political crisis, when the European Commission expressed concerns about the rule of law. The Commission also criticised Romania for failing to root out corruption and political influence in its state institutions. The 2017 Romanian protests were massive public protests against government plans of decriminalizing certain forms of corruption.
Police brutality is also a problem. The Romanian Police was demilitarized in 2002, and has been reorganized, in order to modernize it and rid it of former abusive practices inherited from the communist era. However problems, such as police brutality, are reported to persist. According to the US Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, NGOs and the media reported that "police mistreated and abused prisoners, pretrial detainees, gypsies, and other citizens, primarily through use of excessive force including beatings". Prison conditions are another problem: in 2017, the ECHR ruled that detention conditions in Romanian prisons are in breach of European Convention of Human Rights.
Freedom of the press
The government has been accused at times of restricting freedom of the press. Journalists who wrote reports critical of government policies and actions have claimed they were targets for harassment and intimidation during the 2004 Romanian presidential election. Romania was ranked 46th out of 178 countries in Reporters Without Borders' 2017 World Press Freedom Index; another report by Freedom House describes the Romanian press as "partly free".
Human trafficking
There has been a growing awareness of human trafficking as a human rights issue in Europe (see main article: Human trafficking in Romania). The end of communism has contributed to an increase in human trafficking, with the majority of victims being women forced into prostitution. Romania is a country of origin and country of transit for persons, primarily women and children, trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation. The Romanian government has shown some commitment to combat trafficking but has been criticized for failing to fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking.
The new Romanian Criminal Code, which came into force on 1 February 2014, creates several offenses against slavery, human trafficking, child trafficking, pimping, forced labour, and using exploited persons (Art. 182 Exploitation of a person, Art. 209 Slavery, Art. 210 Trafficking in human beings, Art. 211 Trafficking in underage persons, Art. 212 Pressing into forced or compulsory labor, Art. 213 Pandering, Art. 214 Exploitation of beggary, Art. 216 Use of an exploited person's services).
Romania has ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings; and is also a party to the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children.
Children's rights
Children's rights are protected by several laws; and Romania also has international obligations due to the conventions it has ratified.
Children have equal rights, regardless of whether they were born inside or outside of marriage. This is stipulated in the Romanian Constitution, at Art. 48 (3) which states "Children born out of wedlock are equal before the law with those born in wedlock"; and also by Art. 260 of the civil code. In addition, Romania ratified The European Convention on the Legal Status of Children Born out of Wedlock, and, therefore, it is bound to ensure that children born outside marriage are provided with legal rights as stipulated in the text of this Convention.
The [272/2004] Law on the protection and promotion of the rights of the child, republished in 2014 is an important law dealing with children's rights.
According to the new criminal code which came into force on 1 February 2014, Article 197 titled Ill treatments applied to underage persons outlaws child abuse. The general age of consent in Romania is 15. Romania has also ratified the Lanzarote Convention. As a European Union member, it is also subject to the EU's Directive 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.
With regard to the right to education of children, parents/legal guardians are obligated to ensure the child gets an education; failure to do so can result in criminal prosecution (Art. 380 Preventing access to compulsory public education).
Parents/legal guardians have an obligation to ensure that their children do not engage in undesirable behaviors. For example, according to Art 33 of Law No. 61/1991 penalising the violation of public order and social standards, parents/legal guardians who fail to take "adequate measures" to prevent children under 16 from engaging in vagrancy, begging, or prostitution are liable to pay a contraventional fine (Law No. 61/1991 on contraventions applies only in cases when the deed of the guilty party does not constitute a criminal offense).
The US Country Reports on Human Rights Practices reports that some children, particularly from the Roma ethnicity, were not registered (although birth registration is mandatory under the law).
Under the new Civil Code of Romania which came into force in October 2011, the general marriageable age is set at 18, but can be lowered to 16 under special circumstances, with authorization from the district's administrative board. (Art 272 Marriageable age). Law nr. 288/2007 increased girls' marriageable age, bringing it in line with that of boys; prior to this law, girls could, in special cases, get married at 15, and as a general rule at 16.
Romania is a party to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.
Women's rights
Women's rights in Romania are subject to constitutional provisions and internal laws. Romania is also bound by directives of the European Union, and international conventions it has ratified.
The Constitution of Romania protects women's rights. Article 4 (2) enshrines the principle of non-discrimination, stating that: "Romania is the common and indivisible homeland of all its citizens, without any discrimination on account of race, nationality, ethnic origin, language, religion, sex, opinion, political adherence, property or social origin". Art 48 (1) ensures equal rights in family law: "The family is founded on the freely consented marriage of the spouses, their full equality [...]." The rights of women in the workforce are also protected: Article 47 (2) reads: "Citizens have the right to pensions, paid maternity leave [...]" and Article 41 states: (2) "All employees have the right to measures of social protection. These concern employees' safety and health, working conditions for women and young people [...]" and (4)
"On equal work with men, women shall get equal wages."
With regard to the new civil code, relevant provisions include Art. 30 Equality in front of the civil law and Art. 258 The Family (freely given consent for marriage; equality of the spouses).
In 2016, Romania ratified the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention).
Anti-discrimination laws
Romania has many laws banning discrimination. The problems in the country are not rooted in lack of legislation, as Romania has a strong de jure framework, but in the lack of enforcement of the existing laws - often due to bureaucracy, corruption, and social norms. The most important anti-discrimination laws are:
Ordinance no. 137 of 31 August 2000 republished (law on preventing and sanctioning all forms of discrimination)
Law no. 202 of 19 April 2002 republished (law on equality of opportunity and treatment between men and women)
In addition to these laws specifically created to deal with discrimination, articles banning discrimination can also be found in many general laws, which deal with general aspects of life, and also contain specific articles banning discrimination in that area (e.g. Law no. 188 of 8 December 1999 republished [law on the status of civil servants], the Labour Code of 24 January 2003, the Law on National Education no.1/2011, etc.). Furthermore, discrimination is also addressed in the Criminal Code, art Art. 297 (2) which reads:"The same punishment applies to the action of a public servant who, while exercising their professional responsibilities, limits the exercise of a right of a person or creates for the latter a situation of inferiority on grounds of race, nationality, ethnic origin, language, religion, sex, sexual orientation, political membership, wealth, age, disability, chronic non-transmissible disease or HIV/AIDS infection".
Domestic violence
Domestic violence is serious problem in Romania. Although Romania has improved its legislative framework in the 21st century, and also ratified the Istanbul Convention in 2016, violence against women occurring in the private sphere remains an issue. Romania was convicted by the ECHR in 2017 for its failure to act.
Right to education
Romania has been criticized for its failure to enforce the right to education of certain social groups, namely rural children and Roma children, notwithstanding the fact education in Romania is compulsory until the 10th grade (usually corresponding to age 16 or 17). Segregation of Roma children in schools, which is illegal, continues unofficially in some schools, and in 2017 the NGOs ERRC and Romani CRISS urged the European Commission to launch an investigation into the segregation of Roma children in schools. The access of children who live in rural areas to education is another area of concern: their situation becomes very problematic after the eighth grade (the last grade of middle school/gymnasium corresponding to age 14-15) because children must change schools to go to high school, and many villages do not have high schools, and therefore parents must make arrangements for their children to commute to the nearest locality or for the child to move there, which is difficult, and as a result many children abandon school (despite the fact that education is compulsory until tenth grade). In one study, a third of rural school children said they planned to drop out of school after eighth grade.
Background of human rights in Romania
Romania at the turn of the 20th century was a very progressive country and had strong human rights roots: it was, for instance, one of only seven countries in Europe to have abolished the death penalty during peacetime. However the image of Romania was later tarnished internationally by severe violations of human rights during successive dictatorship systems: that of Ion Antonescu during World War II; and the following communist Romania regime which included executions of political 'enemies' in the 1950s, and later on, the infamous natalist policy of Nicolae Ceaușescu, with its resulting abuse of unwanted children in Romanian orphanages, as well as the extreme control of everyday life through practices such as phone bugging, and other abuses of the communist Securitate. Human rights improved greatly after the Romanian Revolution.

Route 165 and County Road 165 (CR 165) form a loop around the west side of Branson, Missouri, in Taney and Stone counties. The highway's southern terminus is at US 65 south of Branson, in Hollister. Even though the county road designation belongs to Taney County, it briefly enters Stone County at Table Rock State Park. Upon re-entering Taney County, it crosses the Table Rock Lake Dam, along with Route 265, at Table Rock Lake. Its northern terminus is at US 65 along the Red Route in north Branson.
Route description
CR 165 begins at, and running concurrently with, US 65 Business at an interchange with US 65, where the road meets Industrial Park Drive in Hollister. The road begins its loop around Branson's west side in a clockwise direction. Near the entrance to College of the Ozarks at Opportunity Lane, US 65 Bus. turns right, while CR 165 heads left. The road eventually leaves Hollister and crosses Short Creek in rural Taney County. It then joins Route 265 in a concurrency, at which point Missouri Route 165 begins. In Table Rock State Park, the three highways briefly enter Stone County, where the road encounters the junction with the Showboat Branson Belle. After re-entering Taney County, the road crosses the Table Rock Dam on the White River, and enters the Table Rock neighborhood of Branson. There, Route 265 splits from the concurrency, turning left while Route 165 and CR 165 head right. When Route 165/CR 165 arrive at the intersection with Seventy-six Country Boulevard in Branson, Route 165 ends and CR 165 continues north along the Blue Route (Gretna Road). The Blue Route leaves this concurrency by turning right on Roark Valley Road, while Gretna Road continues north with CR 165. When the road meets the Route 248/Red Route concurrency on Shepherd of the Hills Expressway, CR 165 heads east along with Route 248 and the Red Route until they meet the interchange with US 65. There, CR 165 and Route 248 terminate, as the Red Route continues into Downtown Branson.
History
The portion of CR 165 that runs between the southern terminus of Route 165 and Freeman Lane (former US 65/US 160) was once part of Route 165. This stretch of CR 165, along with the portion between Freeman Ln. and Opportunity Drive, is designated Historic Highway 165 on street signs. The stretch of CR 165 between Opportunity Dr. and US 65 in Hollister was once signed as Route V.

Walter Halliday (also spelled Halladay, Haliday, Halyday, and Holliday) was a long-serving royal minstrel in England in the 15th century. He was a founder member of a minstrels' guild which was the forerunner of the present Worshipful Company of Musicians. He is believed to be the founding father of the Halliday family of Gloucestershire, and an ancestor of some of the Halliday/ Holladay/ Holliday/ Hollyday families in the United States.
Family
Surviving records show that Walter was a minstrel in the service of three successive kings, for at least fifty-four years, between 1415. and 1469. This suggests that he was born not later than 1400.
According to Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Commoners of England (1836), Walter was a younger son of the chieftain of Annandale in Dumfries in Scotland. However, Burke does not cite the source of this information and, as the Bluemantle Pursuivant at the College of Arms stated in 1975, this book "is compiled from family traditions, not proved, and is not accepted as an authority; there are many errors in it".
The records show that, in addition to Walter, two other Hallidays were royal minstrels in the first half of the 15th century : William and Thomas. As William appears to have been older than the other two, it's possible that Walter and Thomas were brothers and William was their father. The recurrence of surnames in the lists of royal minstrels over the years strongly suggests "that minstrelsy could be a family business".
Royal minstrel
Walter's first recorded listing as a royal minstrel is at the battle of Agincourt in 1415. He, and William and Thomas, are listed among the minstrels in King Henry V's retinue. Thereafter, his name appears in the royal financial records on many occasions between 1421 and 1467, particularly in connection with payments of livery (clothing) allowances.
In 1423, King Henry VI authorised a regular payment to the minstrels. In 1439, Henry VI granted Walter and other minstrels an annual payment, on condition that they did not work for anyone else.
In the late 1440s, the royal court became aware that "many rude husbandmen and artificers" were posing as royal minstrels and charging money for their amateur performances. This defrauded the public, and cheated the real minstrels of income. In 1449, Henry VI therefore authorised William Langton (marshal of the minstrels), Walter Halliday, and five other royal minstrels to investigate these activities and to punish the impostors.
In 1456, Walter and three other minstrels were commissioned to recruit "suitable boys, instructed in the art of minstrelsy", to take the place of some royal minstrels who had died.
Henry VI's reign ended in 1461, when his cousin, Edward of York, deposed him and seized the throne as King Edward IV. This does not appear to have affected the minstrels, as they retained their positions under the new king. By 1464, Walter had succeeded Langton as Marshal of the Minstrels and was now in charge of all the minstrels. By then, he had been a minstrel for around fifty years. It is on record that, when Edward IV married Elizabeth Woodville in 1464, Walter conducted an orchestra of 100 players.
A few years later, it appears that the minstrels were reorganised under two marshals, one for the 'haut' instruments, i.e. trumpets, horns, nakers, tabors, bagpipes, and shawms, and one for the 'bas' instruments, i.e. organs, flutes, crumhorns and stringed instruments. Walter was marshal of the 'bas' minstrels, which suggests that he himself played one or more of those instruments.
Walter last appears on record in 1469, when the problem of bogus minstrels defrauding the public and cheating the official minstrels out of income, was dealt with again. In 1469, Edward IV granted a royal charter authorising "Walter Haliday (marshal), John Cliff, Robert Marshall, Thomas Grene, Thomas Calthorn, William Cliff, William Christean, and William Eynsham our minstrels" to found a brotherhood or guild of minstrels. It was to be headed by a marshal, appointed for life and two wardens elected annually. No minstrel, no matter how skilled, was to be allowed to perform in public unless he was a member of the guild, and the guild had the power to fine offenders. This guild is regarded as a forerunner of the Worshipful Company of Musicians.
For how much longer Walter served as Marshal of the Minstrels is unknown. He is believed to have retired to Rodborough in Gloucestershire and owned property there.
Supposed knighthood and coat of arms
A story arose in the United States of America, in the twentieth century that, in addition to being "master of the revels" (sic), Walter Halliday had been knighted, had fought alongside Edward IV in the Battle of Tewkesbury, and had been granted a coat of arms "for his valor" in the battle. The arms attributed to "Sir" Walter is those listed in Burke's Commoners : Sable, three helmets Argent garnished Or within a bordure engrailed Argent. Crest : A demi-lion rampant Or supporting an anchor Azure. Motto : 'Quarta Saluti'.
This story does not stand up well under scrutiny. Walter would have been around seventy years old at the time of the battle of Tewkesbury in 1471, and rather old to be taking up the sword instead of his accustomed musical instrument. He is not listed among the knights created by Edward IV before or after the battle. Bluemantle Pursuivant reported in 1975 that "I find no trace of Sir Walter in the official records of the College of Arms", and that "the arms in Burke's Commoners are wrong".
The coat of arms supposedly granted to Walter is actually that which was confirmed to his descendant Sir Leonard Holliday, lord mayor of London, in 1605, and the crest was granted to Sir Leonard at the same time. A possible explanation for the attribution of these arms to Walter is that, because Burke's Commoners states (without citing a source) that they were granted in the time of Edward IV, it has been assumed that Walter, his "master of the revels" (sic), was the grantee. Burke is incorrect as to the date of the arms, as they are known to have existed long before the reign of Edward IV, and before kings of arms began formally granting arms.

Azwan bin Muhamad Saleh (born 6 January 1988) is a Bruneian footballer who plays for DPMM FC as a midfielder or left-sided full-back. His patronym is sometimes erroneously written as Salleh.
Club career
Azwan first played club football with QAF FC in the B-League Premier I, gaining his first international appearances while his team was sent to represent the national team for regional qualifying tournaments of the likes of AFC Challenge Cup and the AFF Championship. He transferred to the under-21 team of DPMM in 2007, initially playing as a striker. He played deeper in midfield as the 2007-08 season progressed, which would be the final season DPMM played in Malaysia. Moving to the Singaporean S.League in 2009 with his club, he was a key player for Vjeran Simunić who deployed him on the left side of DPMM's midfield. Their season was ended abruptly due to FIFA's suspension of Brunei, but not before winning the League Cup.
Azwan was loaned to Indera SC in 2010 while his parent club were barred from playing in the S.League. The ban was lifted in 2012 and DPMM retained Azwan who started in their first game back against Tampines Rovers. They replicated their League Cup success that year, with Azwan scoring a direct free-kick in the final.
Due to the emergence of namesake Azwan Ali Rahman from 2014, Azwan switched to a more defensive role, surrendering the number 7 shirt in 2015. He played in 15 games, half of them substitute appearances as DPMM won their first S.League title. He scored his first league goal in 3 years against Geylang International on 5 August via a long-distance shot with his weaker right foot.
International career
Azwan was a member of the Brunei Under-21s for the 2007 Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy held in his home country. He also played for the Under-23s at the 2008 Sukma Games in Malaysia and captained the side at the 2011 SEA Games in Indonesia.
Azwan holds the record number of appearances, with 27 caps to his name. His debut came in the 2006 AFC Challenge Cup in a 0–1 loss against Sri Lanka in Bangladesh. He scored on two occasions in AFF Suzuki Cup qualifying, one against Timor-Leste in 2008, the other against Cambodia in 2012.
Azwan was appointed captain of the national team for the two-legged 2018 World Cup qualifier against Chinese Taipei. The team went down 0–2 at home after an encouraging 1–0 win at Kaohsiung. Azwan joined up with the Wasps for the 2016 AFF Suzuki Cup qualification held in Cambodia in October 2016. With Najib Tarif injured since the first game, he was placed at left-back in the third game against Laos which ended in a 4–3 loss.
Azwan started the first match of the 2016 AFC Solidarity Cup in central midfield against Timor-Leste in Kuching, Malaysia. The match ended 4–0 to the Wasps in their biggest victory of date. He played a total of four games for the Wasps at central midfield in the tournament.
Azwan was in line for an international recall in June 2019 for the 2022 World Cup qualification matches against Mongolia, but made himself unavailable due to unspecified reasons. Three years later, he made his 27th international appearance against Malaysia away in Kuala Lumpur as a substitute in a 4–0 loss on 27 May. In the same year, he clocked another appearance from the bench against Laos in a 1–0 win at Bandar Seri Begawan on 27 September.

Akko Light () or Acre Light, is an active lighthouse in the port of Acre, Israel. It is located on the South-West corner of the city's ancient walls, at what is believed to be the former site of an Ottoman Burj-El-Sanjak (Flag Tower, ).
History
The station was established in 1864. As charts of the area were based on measures from 1862, the French navy chart of 1866 does not mention it, and it only appeared later on amended charts. The current structure was established in 1912.
Structure and display
The main structure is a tapering cylindrical concrete tower with four ribs. It is painted in a black and white checkered pattern and topped with a gray metallic lantern room and a gallery. A small white painted equipment shack stands next to the tower.
The light is displayed at . The light characteristic shown is two white flashes every seven seconds (Fl.(2)W.7s), visible for .
The lighthouse is closed to the public, but there is a stone stairwell going down from the base directly into the sea.

"The Fletcher Memorial Home" is a song by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd. The song appears on their 1983 album, The Final Cut. It is the eighth track on the album and is arranged between "Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert" and "Southampton Dock". The song is also featured on the Pink Floyd compilations Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd and A Foot in the Door – The Best of Pink Floyd.
History
The song is about Waters' frustration with the leadership of the world since World War II, mentioning many world leaders by name (Ronald Reagan, Alexander Haig, Menachem Begin, Margaret Thatcher, Ian Paisley, Leonid Brezhnev, Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon), suggesting that these "colonial wasters of life and limb" be segregated into a specially-founded retirement home. It labels all the world leaders as "overgrown infants" and "incurable tyrants" and suggests they are incapable of understanding anything other than violence or their own faces on a television screen.
In its concluding lines, the narrator of the song gathers all of the "tyrants" inside the Fletcher Memorial Home and imagines applying "the Final Solution" to them.
Fletcher in the name of the song is in honour and remembrance of Roger Waters' father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who was killed during the Second World War at Anzio.
The Fletcher Memorial Home scenes in The Final Cut film were filmed at Forty Hall in Enfield.
Reception
In a review for The Final Cut, Patrick Schabe of PopMatters described "The Fletcher Memorial Home" as "majestic, but clunky".

The Baudó oropendola (Psarocolius cassini) is a species of bird in the family Icteridae. It is endemic to Colombia. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, which are threatened by destruction. As it is only known from a small number of locations, its conservation status has been assessed as "endangered" by the IUCN.
Description
The male Baudó oropendola is about in length and the female is slightly smaller at . This bird is similar in appearance to the black oropendola (Psarocolius guatimozinus), being largely black with chestnut-brown upper parts, but the patches of bare skin on the cheeks are pink, the mantle and wings are more rufous-brown and the flanks are rather more chestnut.
Distribution
This species is endemic to a small area around los Saltos and de Baudó, in the Chocó Department of north-west Colombia, an area of occupancy of about . The bird has only been observed in a few isolated locations in river valleys at the edge of humid rainforests, but more recently birds have been sighted in the river valleys of the Rio Siviru and Rio Tipicay near Bajo Baudó, and a location has been found on the coastal plain with sixty inactive nests suspended from Bactris gasipaes palms and Guazuma ulmifolia trees in secondary growth between a banana plantation and the edge of the mature forest.
Status
The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the conservation status of P. cassini as being "endangered"; this is because of the small number of locations from which it is known, and the degradation of its habitat as deforestation takes place for logging, the creation of oil palm plantations, agricultural activities and road-building. It is estimated that the total population of the bird numbers between 1000 and 2500 individuals and is likely to be declining. However the bird is little-known, and there may be other breeding colonies at present unknown; if that proves to be the case, the bird's status may need to be changed to "vulnerable".

Jean Creton (fl. 1386–1420) was a medieval French historian and poet who served as valet de chambre (or squire) to King Charles VI of France in the late fourteenth century. He is most notable, however, for his chronicle (written in verse) that he wrote of his travels to England in 1399, where he was an eyewitness to the deposition of the King, Richard II. Although he seems to have visited for the purposes of "amusement and to see the country," with a now unknown companion, he witnessed at first hand the events leading up to the deposition of King Richard II of England by his cousin Henry Bolingbroke. It has been described as the "fullest and most circumstantial" of the various contemporary narratives.
Travels with the King and deposition
Creton travelled to Ireland with the King on his expeditionary force in May 1399, but was sent back to Wales with the Earl of Salisbury two months later.
Creton had deliberately joined Salisbury's retinue because of the earl's mighty chivalric reputation. The following month, August, saw the hurried return of the King from Ireland, alarmed at the news of Bolingbroke's landing at Ravenspur, Yorkshire, when he should have been in exile. Creton waited with the King at Conway Castle, and here he witnessed the Earl of Northumberland arrival and then that of Bolingbroke. Along with the other minor members of the royal entourage, Creton was required by the earl to leave the castle with Bolingbroke's herald. The chronicler was later open about the fact that, as a recent scholar has put it, Creton "was more frightened than he had ever been in his life." However, on hearing that Creton and his companions were French, Bolingbroke addressed them in their own language and assured them of their personal safety.
One modern English historian of the period has noted how, although Creton was clearly biased towards Richard- who had, after all, personally ensured that he was well looked after during his stay- Creton was still both willing and able to "give credit to Bolingbroke, for... his considerate treatment of the capture King" (and indeed towards himself). Creton noted that when Bolingbroke met Richard at Conway, it was an emotional encounter, with both being tearful and distressed." The king surrendered himself to Lancaster. Following Bolingbroke's capture of the King, Creton secured an interview with him, at which, explaining their position as foreign visitors, he and his associate "pleaded for their lives." Henry granted them their safety, but Creton tells how, being "sad and sick at heart," it was then that they chose to return to France. He may however have witnessed Henry's coronation as King Henry IV, as he later described how- to his dissatisfaction- the crowds of London greeted the new King with as much rapture as if it had been Jesus entering the City.
The Metrical History
Creton's chronicle of events, whilst written with the benefit of hindsight, and containing many of the usual factual errors of detail and chronology, found in most works of the period, "provides, in essentials, a credible account" of this fast-moving period. Creton explains that he was moved to write his account at the urging of the Earl of Salisbury, who had been captured with Richard (and, indeed, was executed the following year). It was doubtless only the fact that Creton had returned to France prior to setting down his thoughts on paper- and thus "beyond the reach of Henry's heavy hand"- that he was able to do so unmolested. This took place sometime between November 1401 and March 1402. It was not unusual for him to decide to do so. In fact, a group of French chronicles of Richard's reign were produced in somewhat of a flurry around this time, due to the fact that in 1396 Richard had married the French King's daughter Isabella.Créton is notable for being one of the few contemporary chroniclers who believed Richard II was in fact alive after 1399- possibly, in fact, the only one. In his chronicle he says that, when Richard's body was displayed in St Paul's Cathedral in March 1400, he "certainly [did not] believe it was the old King," and, further, that "I think it was [Richard] Maudelyn, his chaplain, whose face, size, height and build were so exactly similar to the King's." He wrote as much to his own King, saying "the representation of [Richard's] image comes to me so often before the eyes of my heart, for by day and night all my mental imaginings" are solely about him. he later described weeping "tears of sympathy" for Richard. Believing Richard to still be alive, to this end, in April 1402, he travelled to Scotland, supposedly to meet with the King. However, soon he realised ("to his great disappointment") that the man he did meet with was in fact an imposter. He subsequently returned to France the same year to confirm Richard's supposedly violent death. Creton himself reports that after the Epiphany Rising, the deposed king was "so vexed at heart by this evil news that from that time onwards he neither ate nor drank and thus, so they say, it came to pass that he died." He did not, however, report this while passing through England on his return to France.

Choi–Williams distribution function is one of the members of Cohen's class distribution function. It was first proposed by Hyung-Ill Choi and William J. Williams in 1989. This distribution function adopts exponential kernel to suppress the cross-term. However, the kernel gain does not decrease along the axes in the ambiguity domain. Consequently, the kernel function of Choi–Williams distribution function can only filter out the cross-terms that result from the components that differ in both time and frequency center.
Mathematical definition
The definition of the cone-shape distribution function is shown as follows:

L′ordalia, is the third novel by Italo Alighiero Chiusano, published in 1979. The title recalls the ordeal, a judicial practice by which, during Middle Ages, the guilt or innocence of the accused was determined by subjecting them to an unpleasant, usually dangerous experience.
Theme
Runo, a young scribe at the papal court in Rome, discovers that the famous Donation of Constantine, upon which the temporal power of the Pope is based, is a forgery. His disillusionment is so great that he leaves Rome and sets out on a life of adventure in search of the truth about himself, the world and the Church. In his wanderings through medieval Italy (it is the year 1000) he encounters many situations, some happy and some terrifying, and manages to defeat all his enemies. Master and guide in his journey is a wise monk, Petro, who faced himself directly the ordeal bearing his faith up above his head. In this journey, Runo takes part into battles, discovers true love in the arms of a beautiful countryside girl, and, eventually, meets the young emperor Otto III, to whom he reveals the secret of the forgery in the hope that Otto will build a Church without temporal possessions and power.
Critics
The novel became very appreciated by the critics very soon after the publication, winning the prestigious Premio Selezione Campiello in 1979.
Inspired novels
One year after the publication of L′ordalia, the novel The Name of the Rose, by Umberto Eco, was published. There are many similarities between the two novels: the time set (Middle Ages), the novel typology (meant as a bildungsroman, or coming-of-age novel), as well as the main character (a novice) and his helper (a wise monk, with the role of the master). These many similarities, and the notoriety of L′ordalia in 1979, of whom a literature expert such as Umberto Eco was definitely aware, make us think that L'ordalia could be one of the sources of inspiration of some parts of The Name of the Rose (which was written between 1978 and 1980). Moreover, the important role given by Chiusano to the main character's diary, symbol of his experience and evolution throughout all his adventures. It is chosen to link the main character's story, with the reader's one. And one can think of it as chosen by Eco to link Runo's story, with Adso's one, by means of the incipit: Naturally, a manuscript.

Beeches Pit is an archaeological site in Suffolk, England, dated to around . It contains palaeoenvironmental remains, and is particularly notable because it provides evidence of the human use of fire, the earliest in Britain. In addition, knapping debris and Acheulean hand axes have been found. It is one of the richest sites in England for evidence of human activity during that period, and the hand axes are the "earliest post-Anglian handaxe-making horizon in Britain".
The site is in an old brick pit, near Thetford Forest in Suffolk. Biostratigraphy, amino acid racemisation, and thermoluminescence dating on burnt flint confirm the dating of Marine Isotope Stage 11. The first geological description and record came from Sydney Barber Josiah Skertchly, who was then working in Suffolk for the British Geological Survey, in the 1870s. Further geological research took place between 1991 and 2006; excavations were done by John Gowlett in the 1990s, focusing on two areas, named AF and AH, on the pit's northwestern side.
The pit evidences a rich fauna including mollusks, wood mice, fallow deer, and other animals, who lived in a water-rich environment in a woodland, with human occupation taking place at a time when there were higher temperatures in the summer and more rainfall than today. The molluscs may relate the site to the site now at Swanscombe Heritage Park, which provide evidence of the earliest human beings in England.
At Beeches Pit, humans occupied an area on the north side of a river bank; there was a spring nearby, and flint was available. John Gowlett noted how all seven bifaces (found in two different places) were quite different from each other (and showed more variation than the set found at Kilombe Archeological site in Kenya). One location contained two small hand axes (as well as blanks that could have produced more), but they are "considerably different from one another". The other five, found in the second location, also showed "different approaches to manufacture, and different design targets". Thus the seven hand axes are taken as evidence of the Acheulean pattern which allowed for individuality within certain parameters.
The fires at Beeches pit were large, and were kept going for long periods of time. While one researcher suggested this might evidence that the humans occupying the site could not kindle any fire independently, and thus had to keep it going constantly, others see that as evidence of the place being a kind of home base, where those who remained in the camp while others left kept large fires for "warmth, safety and entertainment", wood being plentiful.

Campbell Hospital was a National Health Service hospital in Portsoy, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It was administered by NHS Grampian.
History
The hospital was initiated following a donation from a Mr Campbell and the gift of land by the Dowager Countess of Seafield. It was designed by William Kelly as an infectious diseases hospital. It was opened as the Campbell Infectious Diseases Hospital in 1904 and was extended in 1926 and 1939. It joined the National Health Service as a geriatric hospital in 1948. Following development work at Chalmers Hospital, Banff, Campbell Hospital closed in early 2011.

Maxwell Garvie was a Scottish farmer and businessman who was murdered in 1968, in "one of the most infamous murders in Scottish criminal history".
The following year his wife, Sheila Garvie, and her lover, Brian Tevendale, were convicted of his murder after a sensational trial at the Aberdeen High Court, which included revelations about group sex and drugs. It was Tevendale who shot Maxwell with a rifle while he was asleep. Later Tevendale disposed of the body in a tunnel at Lauriston Castle, near St Cyrus.
The case against a third accused, Alan Peters, was found not proven.
While alive, Maxwell enjoyed a lascivious life. He was fond of female company and maintained physical relations with many. Tevendale's sister Trudy Birse was just one of them. Maxwell frequently arranged wild parties in his house which involved orgies. At first Sheila was not eager to take part, but her husband insisted and the latter won.
Sheila Garvie and Tevendale broke off contact shortly after the trial, they were both released in 1978. Tevendale died in December 2003, whilst Garvie died from Alzheimer's disease in 2014, aged 80.

A chain of title is the sequence of historical transfers of title to a property. It is a valuable tool to identify and document past owners of a property and serves as a property's historical ownership timeline. The "chain" runs from the present owner back to the original owner of the property. In situations where documentation of ownership is important, it is often necessary to reconstruct the chain of title. To facilitate this, a record of title documents may be maintained by a registry office or civil law notary.
Chain of title for real property
Real estate is one field where the chain of title has considerable significance. In real estate transactions in the United States, insurance companies issue title insurance based upon the chain of title to the property when it is transferred. Title insurance companies sometimes maintain private title plants that track real estate titles in addition to the official records. In other cases, the chain of title is established by an abstract of title, sometimes, although not always, certified by an attorney. In the United States, some holders of mortgage debt may be unable to establish chain of title, despite the fact that clear chain of title can be required by the mortgage holder before foreclosure can proceed. Widespread lack of clarity in chain of title results from a 1995 decision by many lenders to rely on a third entity—often, a specific company, Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (MERS)--to hold title nominally, in an effort to enable the buying and selling of mortgage liabilities without registration of changes of ownership with local governments. US states have objected and even sued over this practice.
Chain of title for copyrights, trademarks, and rights of publicity
In the motion picture industry, the chain of title involves the series of documentation which establishes proprietary rights in a film. The chain also applies to compilations in other fields, where many people have contributed to the project, thus acquiring authorship rights, or where materials were culled from many sources. Chain of title is extremely important to film purchasers and to film distributors, as it establishes the veracity of the owner's proprietary rights (or rights under license) in the intellectual property in a film, book or encyclopedia.
Chain of title documentation can include:
copyright clearances on music from the regional collecting society, and to a less common extent, footage of other films;
trademark clearances;
talent agreements, which should incorporate a legal release from the talent, be they actors (including crowds), directors, cinematographers, choreographers, or others, to use their works, images, likeness and other personality rights in the film;
proof of errors and omission insurance (a special form of insurance for motion picture producers which covers omissions in obtaining adequate chain of title).
Specialist organizations engage in the production of copyright property reports for motion picture studios, which cover original or unexploited works, and include the results of United States Copyright Office screening searches, author claimant searches, registration renewal searches and assignment searches. This involves reviewing US Copyright Office records from 1870 to present and numerous trade publications and databases, and Library of Congress records.

Dragnet is a 1954 American crime film directed by Jack Webb and written by Richard L. Breen. The film stars Webb, Ben Alexander, Richard Boone, Ann Robinson, Stacy Harris, Virginia Gregg and Vic Perrin. The film was adapted from the radio series of the same name, and is part of the wider Dragnet media franchise. The film was released by Warner Bros. on September 4, 1954.
Plot
The film uses the inverted detective story format. Los Angeles police detective Sergeant Joe Friday hunts down the killer of a mobster, Miller Starkie, focusing on West Coast mafia second-in-command Max Troy (played by Harris). The film depicts illegal police harassment against a suspect cleared by a grand jury. The vendetta between Friday and Troy becomes increasingly bitter and personal as the film proceeds, leading to a brawl at a private card game between Friday, Frank Smith, and several of Troy's henchmen. A policewoman (Robinson) infiltrates Troy's nightclub and is able to obtain vital information on the Starkie killing; Friday then gets additional evidence when an accomplice of Troy is sent out of state and killed, and the man's wife breaks down and gives the police what they need to convict Troy. The gangster, though, winds up never being prosecuted.

Presidential M&M's is the name given to the commemorative packs of red, white, and blue-colored M&M's given to guests of the president of the United States on board Air Force One and in other presidential locations. They were first created in 1988 and they later replaced cigarettes as the standard gift given to guests of the president. The M&M's are presented in boxes about the size of a packet of cigarettes, with the Seal of the President of the United States and the signature of the sitting president on one face, and one of the M&M's characters holding the flag of the United States on the other.
History
Under President John F. Kennedy, large quantities of cigarettes were supplied to the White House and Air Force One. President Ronald Reagan, as part of his anti-drug campaigns, replaced most of the cigarettes with jars of Jelly Belly jelly beans. In 1988, President Reagan wrote to Mars, Incorporated asking for a supply of customized M&M's for the Moscow Summit with the general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev. The first lady, Nancy Reagan, gave them out to Russian children during the summit. After that, M&M's became the official candy of the White House.
President George H. W. Bush continued Reagan's tradition of handing out M&M's to presidential guests but extended the privilege to presidential employees. President Bill Clinton altered the packaging to include the signature of the sitting president beneath the presidential seal. President Barack Obama was mixed on the subject of M&M's. On one occasion upon receiving a bag of trail mix with M&M's, he proceeded to pick out every M&M and declare to his personal aide: "I'm not going to eat these", but he chose to continue the tradition and personally handed out packs of presidential M&M's to guests. Obama also gave them out to children trick or treating at the White House on Halloween, along with dried fruits from First Lady Michelle Obama.
In 2014, Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy gave President Obama facsimiles of three 500-year-old historical works. In return, Obama gave Rajoy some presidential M&M's. The perceived inequality of the exchange provoked criticism from the Spanish press.
Air Force One
Starting under President Kennedy, guests and members of the press who traveled on Air Force One were given packs of 20 cigarettes in a box marked with the presidential seal and the signature of the sitting president, along with a matchbook; it became a tradition that all guests on Air Force One would receive a souvenir of their trip. In 1988, at the behest of Nancy Reagan, smoking was banned on Air Force One and M&Ms replaced cigarettes as the traditional gift for guests using presidential facilities. A spokesman for the White House stated that the change was made because of health concerns around cigarettes, and that candy was more suitable as a souvenir.
On President Donald Trump's first flight aboard Air Force One, unsigned boxes of M&Ms were provided because the ones with Trump's signature were not yet available. In May 2017, presidential M&Ms with President Trump's signature were released.

Muskrat Magazine is an online Indigenous literary, art, and culture publication, published in Toronto. It includes profiles of Indigenous peoples engaged in the arts including literature, film, music, and visual and performing arts.
The publication's name was inspired by the central role of the muskrat in a creation story re-told by Anishnabe storyteller Basil H. Johnston (Wasauksing Ojibway) in his work Ojibway Heritage.
Muskrat Magazine was established by Rebeka Tabobondung (Wasauksing Ojibway) and David Shilling (Ojibway). The founding editor was author Cherie Dimaline (Métis).
The online publication was launched in November 2010, with Tabobondung and Shilling working from their Beverley Street apartment in Toronto. Tabobondung has stated that one of the goals for Muskrat is to explore the history and culture of Canadian Indigenous people in urban cities, where more than 50 percent now live. She and Shilling are cofounders of Maaiingan Productions, a collective of Aboriginal writers and commercial artists who work for a range of corporate and nonprofit clients. Tabobondung and Shilling felt there was a need to start their own publication when one of Maaiingan's clients, the Toronto Native publication Spirit magazine folded in 2008.

The American wigeon (Mareca americana), also known as the baldpate, is a species of dabbling duck found in North America. Formerly assigned to Anas, this species is classified with the other wigeons in the dabbling duck genus Mareca. It is the New World counterpart of the Eurasian wigeon.
Taxonomy
The American wigeon was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus's Systema Naturae. He placed it with all the other ducks, geese and swans in the genus Anas and coined the binomial name Anas americana. Gmelin based his description on Edme-Louis Daubenton's hand-colour plate of "Le Canard Jensen, de la Louisiane" and Thomas Pennant's description of the "American wigeon" in his Arctic Zoology. Pennant had been sent a specimen from New York. The American wigeon is now placed with the Eurasian wigeon and three other dabbling ducks in the genus Mareca that was introduced in 1824 by the English naturalist James Francis Stephens. The name of the genus is from the Portuguese word Marréco for a small duck. The species is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.
An alternative common name is the "baldpate" due to whitish crown and forehead of the male bird.
Description
The American wigeon is a medium-sized bird; it is larger than a teal, but smaller than a pintail. In silhouette, the wigeon can be distinguished from other dabblers by its round head, short neck, and small bill. It is long, with a wingspan and a weight of . This wigeon has two adult molts per year and a juvenile molt in the first year, as well.
The breeding male (drake) is a striking bird with a mask of green feathers around its eyes and a cream colored cap running from the crown of its head to its bill. This white patch gives the wigeon its other common name, baldpate (pate is another word for head). Their belly is also white. In flight, drakes can be identified by the large white shoulder patch on each wing. These white patches flash as the birds bank and turn. In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake looks more like the female.
The hens are much less conspicuous, having primarily gray and brown plumage. Both sexes have a pale blue bill with a black tip, a white belly, and gray legs and feet. The wing patch behind the speculum is gray. They can be distinguished from most ducks, apart from Eurasian wigeon, by shape. However, that species has a darker head and all grey underwing. The head and neck coloring of the female is different as opposed to the Eurasian wigeon. It nests on the ground, near water and undercover. It lays 6–12 creamy white eggs. Flocks will often contain American coots.
The American wigeon is a noisy species, and in the field can often be identified by their distinctive calls. Drakes produce a three note whistle, while hens emit hoarse grunts and quacks. The male whistle makes a wheezy , whereas the female has a low growl .
Distribution and habitat
It is common and widespread, breeding in all but the extreme north of Canada and Alaska and also in the Interior West through Idaho, Colorado, the Dakotas, and Minnesota, as well as eastern Washington and Oregon. The conservation status of this bird is The Least Concern. The majority of the population breeds on wetlands in the Boreal Forest and subarctic river deltas of Canada and Alaska. Although wigeon are found in each flyway, they are most numerous in the Pacific Flyway. Key wintering areas here include the Central Valley of California and Washington's Puget Sound. Farther east, the Texas Panhandle, the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas, and the Caribbean also support large numbers of wintering wigeon.
This dabbling duck is migratory and winters farther south than its breeding range, in the southern half of the United States, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and the Mid-Atlantic coastal region, and further south into Central America, the Caribbean, and northwestern South America. It is a rare but regular vagrant to western Europe, and has been observed in significant numbers in Great Britain and Ireland since at least 1958.
In 2009, an estimated 2.5 million breeding wigeon were tallied in the traditional survey area—a level just below the 1955–2009 average. In recent decades, wigeon numbers have declined in the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada and increased in the interior and west coast of Alaska. The American wigeon is often the fifth most commonly harvested duck in the United States, behind the mallard, green-winged teal, gadwall, and wood duck.
Behavior
The American wigeon is a bird of open wetlands, such as wet grassland or marshes with some taller vegetation, and usually feeds by dabbling for plant food or grazing, which it does very readily. While on the water, wigeon often gather with feeding coots and divers, and are known to grab pieces of vegetation brought to the surface by diving water birds. For this reason, they are sometimes called "poacher" or "robber" ducks. Wigeon also commonly feed on dry land, eating waste grain in harvested fields and grazing on pasture grasses, winter wheat, clover, and lettuce. Having a largely vegetarian diet, most wigeon migrate in the fall well before northern marshes begin to freeze. The American wigeon is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and will form large flocks.
Breeding
Breeding begins in April-May. The nest is a depression on dry ground, often some distance from water. It is lined with grass and down and is hidden in vegetation. The clutch is 7–9 cream colored eggs which measure on average and weigh . They are incubated for 23–25 days by the female only. The male usually deserts the female before the end of incubation period. The young are precocial and leave the nest within 24 hours of hatching. They can feed themselves. The young can fly when around 47 days of age.

The Aquarius 24 Pilot Cutter, also called the Aquarius Pilot Cutter 24, Aquarius 24 Cutter and the Topsail Pilot Cutter, is an American trailerable sailboat that was designed by Frank Parish as a cruiser and first built in 1979.
Production
The design was built by Top Sail Yachts in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, United States. The company built 33 of the boats from 1979 to 1984, but it is now out of production.
Design
The Aquarius 24 Pilot Cutter was intended as a limited production ocean cruising boat and was inspired by 19th century working boat designs. The design goals were ease of handling, comfort and safety.
The design is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of hand-laid solid fiberglass with polyester resin, with wood trim. The deck and coach house are made from fiberglass cored marine plywood. It has a cutter rig with a Gunter topsail gaff rig optional. Spars are all aluminum. It has a spooned plumb stem, an angled transom, a keel-mounted rudder controlled by a tiller, a wooden bowsprit, a "V" shaped boomkin and a fixed long keel. Although described as a trailerable boat, it displaces and carries of lead encapsulated ballast. The trailering weight is estimated to be .
Even though the hull length is , with the bowsprit the length overall is or for the gaff-rigged model, as it has a longer bowsprit.
The boat has a draft of with the standard keel.
The boat is fitted with a Swedish Volvo MD 7 diesel engine of for docking and maneuvering. It could also be fitted with a small outboard motor and at least some were so equipped.
The design was factory delivered with a choice of at least four different interior arrangements and each boat was custom finished. Each of these layouts has sleeping accommodation for six people, with a double slant berth in the bow cabin, a "U"-shaped settee or aft berth on the port side in the main cabin and an aft cabin with a double berth on the starboard side. The galley is located amidships on the starboard side. The head is located just aft of the bow cabin on the starboard side. Cabin headroom is and the fresh water tank has a capacity of .
The design was sold as a "character boat", with features that were reminiscent of the late 19th century, such as ten opening bronze ports as well as bronze turnbuckles, chainplates and winches, as well as tanbark sails. For sailing the design is equipped with lazyjacks, with all lines led to the cockpit.
The design has a PHRF racing average handicap of 258 and a hull speed of .
Operational history
The boat is supported by an active class club, the Aquarius Pilot Cutters Owners Group.
In a 2010 review Steve Henkel wrote, "this is a compact character boat conceived in the 1970s, but designed to look like something from the 1920s or 1930s, and having the same general characteristics: heavy scantlings, lots of bronze hardware ... and tanbark sails ... Her displacement of 8,900 lbs. is more than any of her comp[etitor]s by over 10 percent and stretches the limit of practicality for a 24-foot boat, so her comp[etitor]s are probably all better performers in light air."
A review in Blue Water Boats noted that the boats are "overbuilt", "with a hull thickness varying from 3/8” at the minimum to 5/8" at the turn of the bilge and as much as 3/4" in the keel sections".

Thomas Januarius Smith (13 January 1890 – 23 September 1975) was an Irish-born Australian politician.
He was born in Dublin; his father was James William Smith. He was educated at St Francis Xavier's College, Liverpool, before becoming a clothing salesman. On arrival in New South Wales he became involved with the trade union movement, working as an organiser for the Australian Workers' Union. He was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1917 as the Labor member for King, but with the introduction of proportional representation in 1920 he was defeated running for the multi-member seat of Sydney. He remained involved with the Labor Party, serving on the central executive from 1921 to 1922 and being appointed to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1921, serving until the Council's reconstitution in 1934. He had two children from his first marriage to Grace Mary Lewis, which had taken place on 20 June 1917; his second marriage, on 30 April 1943, was to Alice Adela Louise. Smith died in Manly in 1975.

Nights in Rodanthe is a romantic love story novel by American writer Nicholas Sparks in September 2002.
Set in Rodanthe, North Carolina, the story follows the intense and close romance of a divorced mother, Adrienne Willis, and a divorced father and surgeon, Paul Flanner. The novel's two main protagonists meet in an inn in Rodanthe and fall strongly in love. However, fate and destiny falls upon them when they realize that leaving Rodanthe would mean going back to their separate lives.
Sparks based parts of his story on his own life's events, particularly his courting of the woman he married, Cathy Cote. Themes of genuine romantic love, and sacrifice are incorporated into the novel. Nights in Rodanthe was adapted into a 2008 film of the same name.
Plot summary
The story has a framing device set in Rocky Mount, North Carolina in 2002 where part-time librarian Adrienne Willis is comforting her daughter Amanda, who is struggling to raise her children because she is still mourning her husband's death. To show her daughter she will eventually recover, Adrienne tells Amanda about the time she met a surgeon named Paul Flanner when Amanda was thirteen.
In 1988, Adrienne managed a Rodanthe inn for a friend taking a leave of absence, for an opportunity of escapism. She had divorced her husband, who abandoned her for a younger woman, and she was taking care of her sick father while raising her three children. As soon as she arrives at the inn, a major storm is forecast. Her only customer is Paul Flanner, a 54-year-old recently divorced surgeon also wanting to escape his hectic life, who had sold his house and was being sued for malpractice. The two fall in love throughout the week but realize they will have to go back to their old lives. After conversations about their families, Paul decides to join his estranged son in an Ecuadorian medical clinic to rework their relationship, communicating with Adrienne through letters when she returns to Rocky Mount with her family. The romance continued, but Paul later died.
In the present, Amanda is annoyed her mother did not tell her and her two brothers about the situation. She reads Adrienne's last contact from Ecuador, written by Paul's son Dr. Mark, thanking her mother for helping his father realize how arrogant he had been.
Writing
Sparks developed the rudiments of Nights in Rodanthe while he was writing his fourth novel, The Rescue. He said that he contemplated writing "another short love story ... that harkens back to poignant emotional intensity of The Notebook", his first published novel. Unlike his other works, Nights in Rodanthe was not inspired by a specific person who was involved in Sparks' life; the story drew upon an incident when his mother-in-law requested as a Christmas present that her name and that of her husband, Paul, would appear in a Sparks novel. So Sparks worked on a story that his in-laws would "not only enjoy, but not offend them as well".
Sparks encountered difficulties; it "just didn't seem to come together". For Sparks, there should be an "element that [would keep] the characters apart in order to have drama". Throughout Sparks' career, he has attempted to not use the same element twice, so it had become harder for him to write each new novel. He comments, "If I don't have the 'conflict', I don't have the story, and for the life of me, I couldn't come up with something new to keep the characters apart. ... I also wanted to write a story using older characters, again because it's something I haven't done (with the exception of The Notebook, in which they're elderly, not middle-aged)."
Sparks diverted his attention by working on A Bend in the Road, his fifth novel, and the first draft of The Guardian, which succeeded the release of Nights in Rodanthe. However, The Guardian imposed a "tremendous challenge" to Sparks, and he reckoned it would require a "great deal of re-writing". He was tired of writing the novel and needed a break from it.
So Sparks returned to Nights in Rodanthe: "My mind then returned to the story I'd been thinking about, and suddenly everything began to click. Within days, I suddenly knew exactly how to tell the story. I knew the characters, the setting, and especially and most importantly, the 'conflict' that would keep the characters apart." Sparks started writing the novel in December 2001. He finished the draft in February 2002, and editing continued until April of the same year.
Style and themes
Sparks set the novel in Rodanthe, a small town in the Outer Banks off the coast of North Carolina. He chose Rodanthe because, according to him, it "looks wonderful on the page, and the name itself conjures up a mixture of mystery and sensuality", adding he had wished to write a novel about the place. In an interview, Sparks said, "In Nights in Rodanthe, I needed a sense of isolation. Find another area of coastline in the U.S. that isn't developed where that could happen." The inn, where the majority of the events in the novel happened, is fictitious. According to Sparks, there are a number of bed and breakfasts in other Outer Banks towns that are similar to his description of the inn in the novel, but he chose to create it for the story.
Sparks based parts of the story from his real life events, though less so compared to his previous novels. These events were given twists to "make the story as interesting as possible". The story parallels Sparks' relationship with his wife, Cathy Cote. In his speech in 2002 for the Friends of the Library in Fayetteville, North Carolina, Sparks cited several similarities of the story with his own life. Sparks and his wife, in their senior years, met in a small coastal town where they traveled to in hopes of respite. He recalls, "I sensed something kind and wonderful about Cathy almost immediately, though Cathy (like Adrienne) was a little bit more hesitant in her feelings for me."
The prose of the novel is written in third person. The main body of the novel consists of Adrienne's flashback about her love affair with Paul. Sparks incorporated the themes of sacrifice and existential dread into the story. Adrienne and Paul parted ways for the sake of their children. Sparks comments, "I think that sacrifice is inherent to good parenting. Both Paul and Adrienne loved their children, and the sacrifices they were willing to make them nobler than characters."
According to some critics, Sparks was inspired by the 1992 best-selling novel The Bridges of Madison County in writing Nights in Rodanthe. The Bridges of Madison County has a few similarities to Nights in Rodanthe: the characters are roughly of the same age and their relationships had ended. Sparks, said he was more guided by his novel The Notebook than The Bridges. He explained that the latter is a story of adultery while his is not. The main male character of The Bridges was a loner without children, while Paul has children. In his official website, Sparks writes, "The list [of the disparity of the two novels] could go on and on, but I think you get the point."
Release and reception
Nights in Rodanthe was published in September 2002 by Warner Books to commercial success. It was Sparks' first novel to debut at number one on the best-sellers chart. On July 1, 2003, Grand Central Publishing republished the novel in paperback. Nights in Rodanthe was republished in July 2007 by Hachette Book Group, and the novel's cover features the promotional photo for its film adaptation. An unabridged audio version of the novel was published by Hachette Book Group in August 2008. The audio is narrated by American actress JoBeth Williams, and it spans five hours and 30 minutes. Scarce copies of the first printing of the novel's hardcover edition are sold; the cover bears an autograph by Sparks.
Nights in Rodanthe received mixed reviews. Sheri Melnick of Book Reviews complimented the novel for its "emotional depth", adding, "No doubt bookstores should sell this tearjerker with a box of tissues, as even the most unemotional of readers will be hard pressed not to cry." Karen Valby of Entertainment Weekly magazine gave the book a "C" and notes, "Sparks, no slouch when it comes to a sales hook, employs many of the same elements of Robert James Waller's weepie in his Outer Banks romance." Trisha Finster of Lakeland Mirror complimented Sparks, saying "Sparks has a unique way of going about writing romance in his novels."
The novel was adapted into a film of the same name, released on September 26, 2008, in the United States. Sparks sold the film rights to Warner Bros. American film producer Denise Di Novi produced the film, directed by George C. Wolfe from a screenplay by Ann Peacock and John Romano. Nights in Rodanthe stars American actor Richard Gere as Paul and actress Diane Lane as Adrienne. The movie has received generally negative reviews.

Wayne County is a county located in east central Indiana, United States, on the border with Ohio. As of the 2010 census, the population was 68,917. The county seat is Richmond.
Wayne County comprises the Richmond, IN Micropolitan Statistical Area.
Richmond hosts Earlham College, a small private liberal arts college.
History
The first permanent European-American settlers in the area were Quakers from North Carolina. They settled about 1806 near the east fork of the Whitewater River, an area including what is today the city of Richmond. Jeptha Turner, the first white child in the county, was born here in 1806.
Wayne County was formed in 1811 from portions of Clark and Dearborn counties. It was named for Gen. "Mad" Anthony Wayne, who was an officer during the Revolutionary War. Wayne is mainly remembered for his service in the 1790s in the Northwest Indian War, which included many actions in Indiana and Ohio.
The first county seat was Salisbury, Indiana, a town which no longer exists. It was later moved to Centerville, Indiana in 1818, where it remained until Richmond was designated as the seat in 1873.
During the antebellum years, Wayne County had a number of stations on the Underground Railroad, a network of blacks and whites who aided refugees from slavery to reach freedom. Levi Coffin and his wife Catharine aided more than 1,000 refugees at their home in Fountain City, now designated as a National Historic Landmark and State Historic Site significant to the Ohio River National
In the 1920s, Indiana had the strongest Ku Klux Klan organization in the country, led by Grand Dragons D. C. Stephenson and Walter F. Bossert. Its members controlled the state legislature and had an ally in Governor Ed Jackson. At its height, national membership during the second Klan movement reached 1.5 million, with 300,000 in Indiana. Records show that Wayne County was home to Whitewater Klan No. 60. Robert Lyons, of Richmond, was national chief of staff for the Klan. During this period, the Klan had the most members in cities rather than rural areas; it attracted members new to cities who were unsettled by waves of immigrants from Europe and migrants from other regions of the US.
Geography
According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of , of which (or 99.36%) is land and (or 0.64%) is water. Wayne County includes Indiana's highest natural elevation, Hoosier Hill, at 1,257 feet (383 m).

Climate and weather
In recent years, average temperatures in Richmond have ranged from a low of in January to a high of in July, although a record low of was recorded in January 1994 and a record high of was recorded in July 1988. Average monthly precipitation ranged from in February to in May.
Government
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the Constitution of Indiana, and by the Indiana Code.
County Council: The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.
Board of Commissioners: The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected at-large, county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.
Court: The county maintains a small claims court that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level circuit court.
County Officials: The county has several other elected offices, including sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor, and circuit court clerk. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare party affiliations and to be residents of the county.
Politics
Wayne County is very Republican, even by the standards of traditionally Republican Indiana. It has not supported a Democrat for president since 1936. As a measure of how Republican the county has been, it voted for Barry Goldwater during Lyndon Johnson's 44-state landslide of 1964–albeit by 73 votes. Since then, the Democrats have only come reasonably close to winning the county three times. Bill Clinton held the GOP to pluralities during both of his bids, and Barack Obama came within three percent of carrying the county in 2008.
Demographics
As of the 2010 United States Census, there were 68,917 people, 27,551 households, and 18,126 families residing in the county. The population density was . There were 31,242 housing units at an average density of .

Those of Hispanic or Latino origin made up 2.6% of the population. In terms of ancestry, 24.4% were German, 11.8% were Irish, 11.0% were English, and 10.9% were American.
Of the 27,551 households, 30.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 47.4% were married couples living together, 13.3% had a female householder with no husband present, 34.2% were non-families, and 28.5% of all households were made up of individuals. The average household size was 2.41 and the average family size was 2.93. The median age was 40.2 years.
The median income for a household in the county was $47,697 and the median income for a family was $51,155. Males had a median income of $40,644 versus $30,194 for females. The per capita income for the county was $21,789. About 12.6% of families and 16.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 24.9% of those under age 18 and 9.3% of those age 65 or over.

Hymenophyllum rarum (Hymen-O-FIL-lum rare-um), the narrow filmy-fern, is a species of fern from the family Hymenophyllaceae. This thin-leaved fern is commonly found in New Zealand and Tasmania, growing in patches on rocks and is epiphytic on trees and tree ferns, growing in moist gullies or rainforests. A rather drought tolerant species often found at exposed sites ranging from coastal to montane areas. Forming extensive, interwoven and creeping patches with its thin long (creeping) rhizomes sparsely covered in red-brown hairs, easily recognised by its membranous grey-green fronds, the smooth margins of the pinnae, ultimate segments and indusia; and by the sunken sori in the uppermost segments of the uppermost pinnae. The species can be found throughout Tasmanian rainforests as well as occurring in New South Wales, Victoria and New Zealand on the North and South Islands as well as, Stewart, Chatham and Auckland Islands.
Etymology
Hymenophyllum: Membranous leaf, from the Greek and .
rarum: thin-leaved; from the Latin rarus.
Description
The narrow filmy-fern is distinct by its long thin, creeping rhizome, membranous fronds, that grow in moist areas. Fronds are pale grey-green, and the entire plant is glabrous (devoid of hairs). Fronds are pendant and up to 15 cm long; stipe to 20–70 mm long, very thin, black; rachis winged in the uppermost section of the frond; lamina 1-pinnate 1–2-pinnatifid, pale green, and up to 100 mm in length and 10–25 mm wide, with no toothed margins. Solitary sori borne at apex of segments, and sunken at the base but not tubular; a whorl or rosette of bracts surrounding the inflorescence or at the base of an umbel, shaped like a rhomboid, apex rounded or obtusely angled; receptacle slender, included. Indusium completely covers the sporangia, and splits apart when spores are ready to be dispersed by wind.
Habitat and distribution
The narrow filmy-fern is found in rainforests, forming patches on rocks and is often epiphytic on trees and tree ferns in moist gullies. It is highly dispersed throughout the tropical and south temperate zones occurring across Australia in New South Wales and Victoria. This species can also be found in Tasmania and on the Bass Strait Islands, While being highly dispersed throughout New Zealand, occurring on North and South Islands as well as, Stewart, Chatham and Auckland Islands.
Occurring in coastal to montane habitats, this species is common in rainforests, scrub, shaded cliff faces or amongst boulders and damp gullies. Often growing amongst other filmy-ferns, this species closely resembles is relatives H. cupressiforme and H. peltatum. As with H. peltatum, the pinnae are often divided on only one side. Unlike both these species, however, the pinnae of H. rarum do not have serrated margins.
Taxonomy and evolution
The family Hymenophyllaceae is a largely successful family under the division of Pteridophytes (ferns and fern allies). This family is commonly referred to as the filmy fern family, with around 670–700 named species, only 131 are accepted.
Divided into two genera, Hymenophyllum and Trichomanes. The Genera are separated based on the sorus and gametophyte structures, particularly the indsium structure (membrane covering sorus) and the receptacle.
The Australian plants of H. rarum differ from their New Zealand counterparts with widely spaced pinnae rather than imbricating pale green pinnae. The Sori of the Australian H. rarum are not wholly sunken within the pinnae nor are they bound to the uppermost segments of the uppermost pinnae.
Members from the genus Hymenophyllum are all small, thin and delicate. They are either epiphytic plants or rock plants, forming dense patches or mats along rainforest floors. Members of this family most commonly occur in moist habitats with few members being able to withstand dryer conditions, in which they are able to later 'revive' themselves when moisture becomes readily available.

Käthe Heidersbach (30 October 1897 – 26 February 1979) was a German operatic soprano.
Life and career
Born in Breslau, Heidersbach first wanted to become a pianist and studied piano at the conservatory of her home town. She then took singing lessons with Juan Luria (who was later interned by the Nazi regime and murdered at the Sobibor extermination camp in 1943), Lola Beeth and Fred Husler. The soprano made her debut in 1922 at the Detmold's Stadttheater and was engaged by the Wrocław Opera from 1924 to 1927. From 1927 to 1944, she was engaged at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin.
Guest performances led the artist to Dresden, Amsterdam, Vienna, Zurich, Hamburg, Munich and Barcelona. She was engaged at the Bayreuth Festival from 1928 to 1934, where she sang Waldvogel, Freia, Gutrune, Elsa and Eva, and in 1934 a flower girl in the first Bayreuth new production of Parsifal since Richard Wagner's world premiere production.
In 1934 she was appointed a Prussian Kammersängerin at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden. According to Joseph Goebbels, however, she was not satisfied there, as she is said to have complained to him in March 1939 about too little singing time. On 2 June 1939, she sang Eve in a gala performance of Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg in honour of the Regent Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, which was also attended by Adolf Hitler. Herbert von Karajan was the conductor. This performance became legendary because Karajan, who conducted without a score, got out of time and thus incurred the wrath of the Führer. In September 1941, Heidersbach performed in occupied Krakow as "bearer of the German cultural will in the East", among other places at the Theater der SS und der Polizei there. At this occasion she had lunch with the Governor General Hans Frank.
Heidersbach's first marriage was to Johannes Eppinger. She entered her second marriage in 1928 with the Swedish opera singer Nils Källe who was engaged at the opera of Breslau from 1924 to 1927. After 1945, she worked as a concert soprano and teacher in Stockholm, where she had moved to.
Heiersbach died in Kyrkhult, Olofström Municipality, Sweden at the age of 82.

The Yamaha Ténéré 700 is a midsize adventure/dual-sport motorcycle manufactured by Yamaha since 2019. It features a parallel-twin engine which powers the motorcycle through a six-speed gearbox and chain drive. Brakes are equipped with rider-switchable (on-off) ABS.
History and development
The "baby Ténéré" is the latest in a series of dual-sport Yamaha motorcycles named after the Ténéré desert stage of the Dakar Rally in the Sahara. The successor to Yamaha's XT660Z Ténéré was first announced as the T7 concept at the 2016 EICMA with an anticipated production launch in 2018. A refined concept was publicized a year later.
Yamaha announced that delivery of bikes would begin in Europe in July 2019, and only the following year to the USA due to emissions and other regulatory delays.
The liquid-cooled 4-stroke 8-valve DOHC engine with crossplane crankshaft was already in use and well reviewed in Yamaha's MT-07 naked and Tracer 700 sport touring bikes.

The fatlips minnow (Phenacobius crassilabrum) is a species of suckermouth minnow that was first described in the upper Tennessee River system. No fewer than 20 specimens were used for description, and the epithet crassilabrum (from the Latin crassus meaning thick or fat and labrum, or lip) was assigned to the species, separating it from Phenacobius catostomus, with which it had previously been identified. The first holotype specimen collected in 1947 was an adult female in length from the River.
Geographic distribution
The distribution of the fatlips minnow is restricted to North America, where it occurs in the upper Tennessee River drainage in western Virginia, western North Carolina, eastern Tennessee and northeastern Georgia. Its habitat is gravel and riffles in small to medium creeks. The fatlips minnow is believed to have arisen from a P. catostomus -like stock population that re-invaded the upper Tennessee River via reciprocal stream piracy. A genetic sister relationship between P. crassilabrum and P. uranops has been consistently resolved. The ranges of P. crassilabrum and P. uranops complement one another in the Tennessee River system, with the former opting for higher elevations. In Virginia, P. crassilabrum occupies the lower free-flowing portion of the South Fork of Holston River and Laurel Creek.
There are documented instances of nonindigenous (out-of-range) occurrences of Phenacobius species; these are believed to be a result of fishermen releasing their unused baitfish into local bodies of water. The current population of P. crassilabrum is presumed to be about 10,000 individuals.
Ecology
P. crassilabrum is known to favor gravel riffles in the warm clear waters of small to medium-sized streams and rivers. Species of the genus Phenacobius remain near the bottom of streams, rooting in the ground for their prey of detritus and aquatic insects such as mayfly and caddisfly larvae.
Life history
Breeding activity has not been observed in P. crassilabrum. Spawning for other Phenacobius species occurs in the spring and summer (April to August). Spawning events take place in the preferred gravelly riffles, allowing the released eggs to seek out nooks and crannies within the substrate. The maximum life span described in the genus is three years.
Management
P. crassilabrum, while existing in small numbers in comparison to other species sharing its ecosystem, is considered to be of the least concern in terms of conservation status (IUCN) and its population is considered stable. An additional factor to consider is the movement of non-native fish into the range of P. crassilabrum, threatening habitat and resource availability.

~ Aug 3rd.2004
Bailey went down during the Aug. 3rd training camp practice, and though initial reports were favorable, a week later his knee went under the knife to repair previously undetected cartilage damage. "The damage was worse than anyone had realized from the tests," Lions coach Steve Mariucci said. "The doctor immediately repaired it, but Boss will be off the knee for several weeks, and then will be looking at a rehab period on top of that." Mariucci declined to put a timetable on Bailey's return, but said the Lions hope to have him back this season. Bailey would end up missing the entire 2004 season. As the 2005 season kicked off, Bailey was finally back in pads after a lengthy and frustrating rehab, and his potential began to shine through again, as he played solid through 10 games, ranking 3rd on the team in tackles. But an ankle injury in game 11 turned out to be more severe than expected, and he found himself going to IR for the second straight season in a row.

The 2016 Indiana gubernatorial election was held on November 8, 2016, to elect the governor and lieutenant governor of Indiana, concurrently with the 2016 U.S. presidential election as well as elections to the United States Senate and elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections. The primaries were held on May 3, 2016. Republican Lieutenant Governor Eric Holcomb won the race with 51.4% of the vote.
Incumbent Republican Governor Mike Pence was running for reelection to a second term in office until July 15, 2016, when Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump selected Pence as his vice presidential running mate. As Pence was barred by Indiana law from simultaneously running for both offices, he subsequently withdrew from the gubernatorial election. Pence went on to become Vice President of the United States. He was replaced on the ballot for Governor by his former running mate, incumbent Lieutenant Governor Eric Holcomb, who was selected by the Indiana Republican State Committee as the nominee on July 26, 2016. Holcomb later selected State Auditor Suzanne Crouch on August 1, 2016, to be his running mate as the nomination for Lieutenant Governor was made vacant by the decision of Holcomb to seek the gubernatorial nomination; she was confirmed at a subsequent meeting of the Indiana Republican State Committee later that day.
John Gregg, the former Speaker of the Indiana House of Representatives, was the Democratic nominee. Gregg previously ran for Governor in 2012, but was defeated by Pence.

Republican State Committee selection
On July 15, 2016, Donald Trump announced that Pence would be his running mate as vice president in the 2016 presidential election. Under Indiana law, Pence was unable to run for both governor and vice president simultaneously; he therefore withdrew from the gubernatorial election, creating a vacancy on the Republican ticket. On July 26, the chairman of the Indiana Republican Party, Jeff Cardwell, announced that Eric Holcomb had been nominated by the Indiana Republican State Committee to replace Pence on the ballot for Governor. The vote totals were not released. Holcomb later selected Suzanne Crouch on August 1, 2016, to be his running mate as the nomination for Lieutenant Governor was made vacant by the decision of Holcomb to seek the gubernatorial nomination; she was then confirmed by the Committee at a meeting later that day.

Antihaitianismo (; ), also called anti-Haitianism in some English sources, is prejudice or social discrimination against Haitians in the Dominican Republic.
Antihaitianismo includes prejudice against, hatred of, or discrimination against Haitians due to their physical appearance, culture, lifestyle, and language.
Antihaitianismo in the Dominican Republic
Origins: 16th century through 19th century
Human Rights Watch has stated in their reports that the differences between Haitians and Dominicans can be based on colonial times from linguistic, cultural, and racial differences. For instance, the Dominican Republic was governed by the Spanish, and thus acquired part of their culture from the Spanish, mixed with Africans and Native Americans. Haiti, on the other hand, was governed by the French, and its culture is a mixture of French, African and Native American. The majority of Haiti's population is descended almost entirely from African slaves, while Dominicans possess a multiracial mix of Spanish, African and Indigenous ancestry. It is evident that historical background is related between the two countries, however, there are major cultural divisions.
Antihaitianismo can be traced back to a policy of racial segregation instituted by the Spaniards in the Captaincy General of Santo Domingo (present-day Dominican Republic). Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the island was split into absolutist chiefdoms, three where modern-day Santo Domingo now exists, and two where modern-day Haiti now exists (albeit also including some territory which is currently part of Santo Domingo). Carib people from islands further south were often at war with the Taíno people. Columbus reached the island in 1492 (slaves imported from Africa arrived from 1503 onwards—many natives were also soon enslaved), and within a few decades the Spanish controlled most of the island. During the 17th century, however, the French also began maneuvering for control, and in 1697 acquired the western portion (now part of Haiti—whereas the Spanish portion encompassed the modern Dominican Republic). During the 1790s and early 19th century, the French and Spanish battled back and forth across the island; by 1809 the Haitian Revolution had resulted in the overthrow of both French and Spanish control. The Spanish briefly retook the eastern portion that same year, but in 1821 lost control again in another rebellion. Shortly afterwards, Haitian forces again briefly controlled the entire island, from 1822 to 1844. In 1844 the secret revolutionary movement called "La Trinitaria" took place and the Dominican Republic declared its independence defeating the Haitian forces. After several tumultuous decades, the Spanish briefly acquired nominal control of the Dominican Republic in the 1860s, setting off another war. By the late 19th century, over three hundred years of European control was ended; the modern history of west Hispaniola (Haiti) and east Hispaniola (Dominican Republic) had begun.
Under Trujillo: 1930s and 1940s
Antihaitianismo was strongly institutionalized during the regime of Rafael Leónidas Trujillo. Border disputes under Trujillo culminated in the order of a military intervention and to massacre Haitians accused of practicing vodou or witchery, practices that were against the popular Roman Catholic beliefs in the Dominican Republic at the time. Claims range "from several hundred to 26,000" or even "recorded as having a death toll reaching 30,000" in October 1937, an event subsequently named the Parsley Massacre. During later diplomacy, Trujillo agreed to pay hundreds of thousands in reparations, but somewhat less was actually delivered. Due to corrupt Haitian bureaucrats, exceedingly little reached the families. Dominican intellectuals Manuel Arturo Peña Batlle, Joaquín Balaguer, Manuel de Jesús Troncoso de la Concha, among others, led the campaign.
The 1937 massacre legitimized subsequent state acts of violence against the Haitian-origin population in the Dominican Republic. Each successive government since has forcibly removed thousands of Haitians and Haitian-Dominicans in routine round-ups and expulsions by the military.
Present day: 1990s
Trujillo's policies served to perpetuate antihaitianismo within the Dominican Republic. In the 1996 Dominican presidential election, Joaquín Balaguer (historical leader of the populist right and former right-hand of dictator Trujillo) united in a "National Patriotic Front" with PLD candidate Leonel Fernández in order to prevent José Francisco Peña Gómez, who was adopted as an infant by a Dominican family but born to Haitian parents, from becoming President.

Saifur Rahman Halimi () was born in Afghanistan, and became a legal resident of the United States.
Following the arrest of bombing suspect Najibullah Zazi, and his father Mohammed Wali Zazi, the Associated Press characterized Saifur Rahman Halimi as Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's "chief representative".
In 1996, Halimi was an expert witness in a sexual abuse case.
Mohammad Kargar, a man from Afghanistan who was living in Maine was tried for kissing his 18-month-old son's penis. Halimi testified about the cultural background of Kargar's act when he appealed his conviction. Kargar's conviction was overturned.
Newsday reported on October 14, 2001, five weeks after Al Qaeda's attacks on September 11, 2001, Halimi was a leader of one faction who were disputing control over New York City's largest mosque.
Najibullah Zazi was a 24-year-old Afghan who had triggered suspicion that he had planned to explode a bomb or bombs in New York City on the eighth anniversary of Al Qaeda's attacks on September 11, 2001.
On October 4, 2009, the Associated Press offered a further trigger for suspicion—when Najibullah Zazi was a teenager in Queens, New York, his family lived in the same family as Saifur Rahman Halimi, and had attended the same mosque.

Scott County is a county located in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 census, the population was 174,669, making it the third-most populous county in Iowa. The county seat is Davenport.
Scott County is included in the Davenport–Moline-Rock Island, IA–IL Metropolitan Statistical Area.
History
The first American settlement in the area now known as Scott County was Clark's Ferry or Clark's Landing (now Buffalo) in 1833. Other early towns included Davenport (now the county seat and largest city) and the town of Rockingham (which ceased to exist in 1847). The area was fully surveyed in 1837, and the county was established by the Wisconsin territorial legislature in that same year. Scott County is named for General Winfield Scott, who was the presiding officer at the signing of the peace treaty ending the Black Hawk War.
By 1900 the population of the county was 51,500, and by 1950 it was over 100,000. Scott County now comprises part of the Quad City region, which includes the cities of Davenport and Bettendorf (in Iowa) and Rock Island, Moline and East Moline (in Illinois).
The present Scott County Courthouse was completed in 1955 and expanded along with the jail in 2007. The old section of the Scott County Jail was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The courthouse was included as a contributing property in the Davenport Downtown Commercial Historic District in 2020.
Geography
The county seat is the city of Davenport. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.2%) is water. Part of the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge is located within the county.

Politics
For most of its history, Scott County was primarily a Republican county. From 1880 to 1984, it only supported a Democrat for president nine times, six of which were national Democratic landslides. In more recent elections, the county has become consistently Democratic in presidential elections like many other midsize urban counties nationwide, with the party's candidates winning the county in every presidential election from 1988 on. However, their margins of victory have not been as wide as in many other counties of similar composition, especially in 2016 when Hillary Clinton only won the county by 1,291 votes.

Lieutenant General Sir Scudamore Winde Steel, (1789 – 11 March 1865) was a British Army officer of the East India Company.
Steel was the son of barrister David Steel and Mary Winde, daughter of Scudamore Winde, judge of the Supreme Court of Jamaica. Steel joined the East India Company's service as a cadet in 1805, and the following year was promoted to lieutenant in the Madras Army. He was slightly wounded in the Third Anglo-Maratha War of 1817–18. He was promoted to captain in 1821, and joined the 51st native infantry in 1824. He served on the quartermaster-general's staff at Nagpur and in the First Anglo-Burmese War in 1826. Steel was promoted to major in 1832, and from 1832 to 1845 served as secretary in the military department at Madras.
In 1834, Steel took part in the capture of Coorg, and the following year was promoted to lieutenant colonel. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1838 Coronation Honours.
In 1845, Steel was appointed military auditor-general and promoted to colonel of the Madras fusiliers in 1847. He commanded the Madras army during the Second Anglo-Burmese War in 1852–53. He was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in December 1853. He was promoted to Major General and given the command of the Pegu division and the Martaban provinces in 1854. Steel returned to England in 1856 and was promoted to lieutenant general in 1861.
Steel married Elizabeth Margaret, the eldest daughter of Lieutenant Colonel William Read, in 1840. His eldest son, Col. Charles Steel, served in the Crimean War with the 12th Lancers and was present at the Siege of Sevastopol. He married Anna Caroline Wood, daughter of Rev. Sir John Page Wood, 2nd Baronet.
Sir Scudamore died at his home at Hyde Park, London, in 1865.

The Remote Sensing Center (RSC) at the Naval Postgraduate School was established to bring together a range of capabilities and expertise to address problems of military and intelligence importance, as well as environmental and civil concerns. It is specialized in a variety of remote sensing technologies designed to enable people to look beyond the range of human vision in range or in spectral perception.
Mission
Members of the RSC come from the physics, electrical and computer engineering, computer science, meteorology, and oceanography departments. They are collaborating to develop new remote sensing systems, as well as use and exploit current systems in air and space. It is part of a larger activity in the Monterey Bay area that provides expertise in topical areas outside the technical disciplines available at NPS.
The Naval Postgraduate School, and specifically the Remote Sensing Center, has the ability to handle classified data, as well as access to a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) that is fully equipped with comms, storage, and processing capabilities. The RSC has pre-established cooperative research with government, academia, and industry in the remote sensing sector ranging from local to international partners. Highly experienced military officers, intelligence analysts, and faculty are a critical part of the NPS research staff.
Projects
Lidar
Lidar (LIght raDAR) works as an optical analog to radar in the visible spectrum of light with advantages related to the smaller wavelengths of the laser pulse. Lidar ranges in wavelength from ultra-violet (0.3-0.45 µm) to visible (0.45-0.70 µm) to the infrared (1-15 µm). Lidar can detect much smaller particles than radar in the atmosphere (which cannot detect things smaller than cloud particles), and thus can be used for aerosol detection.
The raw form of data is a set of x,y,z coordinate points. With recent advances, resolution has improved dramatically. Raw data can be processed to remove unwanted areas or features. Outputs such as topographic maps with contour lines can also be derived from lidar. Programs to manipulate lidar data include ENVI, ERDAS IMAGINE, ArcInfo, and ESRI ArcView (with 3D analyst ext.) One useful derivation of lidar data is the DEM (Digital Elevation Model). DEMs are displayed in a raster format with a matrix. The DEM has a specified cell size that corresponds to the earth's surfaces. The cell contains the average elevation of the points within it.
The Remote Sensing Center is planning research projects that undertake the modeling and testing of analytical processing and using more fieldwork to obtain ground-truth measurements. Projects have been completed and are currently underway in terrain classification including Elkhorn Slough and hidden trail identification. Other future projects include a collaboration with the MOdeling, Virtual Environments, and Simulation (MOVES) institute on lidar standards for data structure and visualization tools and modeling new lidar analysis tools.
Spectral Imagery Analysis
Spectral imagery measures the spectral character of materials within the visible range and beyond. Two objects may appear visually identical but may be distinguished through examination of their spectral properties. Computer software can use a color scheme to make them visible.
A subset of spectral imagery, hyperspectral imaging data, is produced when "solar electromagnetic energy reflected from the earth's surface is dispersed into many contiguous narrow spectral bands by an airborne spectrometer" (Stefanou, 1997, p. 2). Our current research and projects include environmental mapping, target detection, and change detection.
The Remote Sensing Center works with airborne and satellite systems including IKONOS/Quickbird multispectral imagery (MSI), and airborne hyperspectral imaging (HSI) systems including AVIRIS, HYDICE, CASI, and HYMAP. Classification and analysis, including atmospheric compensation is performed using standard industry research tools; notably ENVI and ERDAS Imagine. The RSC has acquired a polarimetric camera for expanding experimentation in the visible spectrum.
Intelligence
The Remote Sensing Center benefits from the secure facilities at NPS. Having the ability to process classified data with an on-site, fully equipped Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) allows students and faculty to pursue lines of research and work with technologies unavailable to the public.
The sustained efforts of fully funded graduate students, both military and civilian with an average of eight to ten years of field experience, have conducted research in an array of topics related to remote sensing.
Current projects include:
Helicopter Brownout (terrain classification) using National Technical Means (NTM)
Maritime Domain Awareness (ASW)
Snow/Ice study with UCSB using NTM
Degree Programs
The Remote Sensing Research and Education Program (RS-REP) is an interdisciplinary program to promote Remote Sensing technical education and research advancement to ensure that the Intelligence Community is fully supported for technology evolution. The curriculum is in hiatus as of 2017.

Sandown Manor (also Sande, 11th century; Sandham, 13th-18th century) is a manor house in the parish of Brading on the Isle of Wight.
History
Sandown was held by Ulnod of the Confessor as an alod and was in the king's hands at the time of Domesday. It had passed before the middle of the 13th century to the Glamorgans of Wolverton, Philip de Glamorgan making grants of land there in 1236 and 1241. It seems at this early time to have been divided into North and South Sandown.
In 1236 Philip Glamorgan granted William Malet 2 virgates of land in Sandown in addition to land which William already held there, and about 1280 the heirs of Richard Malet held a quarter of a fee there of Robert de Glamorgan. A few years later John le Marche held this estate, which was evidently in North Sandown. From this time until the middle of the 14th century it would seem that the Glamorgans held the manor in demesne, as in 1316 Robert de Glamorgan was said to hold the vill of Sandown, while tenements in North and South Sandown, later called a manor, were held by John de Glamorgan at his death in 1337. In 1346, however, John Serle held the quarter fee which had formerly belonged to John le Martre (evidently the John le Marche mentioned above), and John Stower was in possession in 1428 and 1431. The manor apparently remained in this family until about the middle of the 16th century.
In 1552 Henry Stower sold the northern portion of the manor to William Jeffreys, who seven years later disposed of it to George Oglander, and with the Oglanders of Nunwell it remained as of 1912. Other portions of the manor were sold by John Stower to Kingswell, Knott, Knight and others.
In 1808 Sir William Oglander established his right to the manor of Sandown in an action against Winchester College, who had inclosed part of the waste land known as Ryal Heath.
The manor of Appley probably formed part of the northern manor of Sandown and was held at the close of the 13th century by William Malet of the manor of Gatcombe as half a fee. In 1609 Sir William Oglander died seised of the manor or farm of 'Apple' in North Sandown. Sir John Oglander, writing in 16th–17th century, calls it 'Appleford alias Apley now Sandam Ferme,' and says it anciently belonged to the Stower family. It was evidently always part of Sandown and has now become merged in it, even its name having disappeared.

The Belgrade–Pristina dialogue is a series of EU-facilitated talks between the governments of Serbia and Kosovo. Serbia claims Kosovo as its southern province under United Nations administration, and rejects its independence. Kosovo considers Serbia as a neighboring state. The negotiations began in March 2011, three years after Kosovo declared independence. They are the first negotiations between the two entities since Kosovo declared independence in February 2008.
Background
The Republic of Kosovo declared independence on 17 February 2008, and has been partially recognized internationally. Serbia took the issue to the International Court of Justice for their advisory opinion. The court's verdict was that Kosovo's Declaration of independence was in accordance with international law. After the verdict Serbia and the European Union submitted a resolution to the United Nations General Assembly which called for technical negotiations between the governments in Belgrade and Pristina. The Serbia-EU resolution passed in the UN General Assembly. The talks were delayed due to the collapse of the Kosovar government, forcing Kosovo into early elections.
The dialogue serves the interests of both Kosovo and Serbia. For Serbia, progress in the dialogue, in the implementation of agreements reached and in the normalization of relations, is a key condition to advance in accession negotiations. Kosovo's progress on its EU path – such as the signing of its Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union, is linked to progress on the dialogue.
The EU facilitated Dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina was launched in March 2011 following a United Nations General Assembly Resolution in September 2010 co-sponsored by the European Union and Serbia, which affirmed the readiness of the EU to facilitate the dialogue and recognized the process as an important transformative power for peace, security and stability in the region.
The dialogue is held in Brussels and is facilitated by the European Union High Representative, the Vice President of the European Commission, and the team in the European External Action Service (EEAS). Meetings and working groups are convened at various levels in Brussels, Belgium, both technical – at chief negotiators' level – and political – at Prime Ministers' and/or Presidents' level.
Initial talks
The talks were first mediated by Robert Cooper. Oliver Ivanović said that Belgrade and Pristina were urged to continue talks in Brussels, but Serbia is not obliged to recognize Kosovo at any point in the process. Borko Stefanović led the Belgrade negotiating team and Edita Tahiri led the Pristina negotiating team.
The talks began on 8 March 2011 and featured three main issues:
Regional cooperation
Freedom of movement
Rule of law.
First round
The first round of dialogue took place on 8–9 March 2011 and covered economic co-operation between the two parties. Other issues on the agenda during the first round of dialogue were telecommunications, air traffic, customs seals, land books and civil records.
Second round
The second round of negotiations was delayed until 28 March 2011. Issues discussed in the second round of talks were electricity and possibly Freedom of Movement, as well as first round topics such as Kosovo's customs seal, air traffic and Kosovo's participation in regional initiatives. On 28 March, the representative discussed land books and registries of births, deaths and marriages, as well as power supply issues. Stefanović stated that "Certain progress has been achieved on land books, birth registries and electric energy supply; we laid out our proposal and hope that there will finally be a positive wrap-up of these topics at the next meeting".
Third round
The third round of dialogue took place on 15 April 2011. The issues discussed were freedom of movement, registration plates for vehicles and the recognition of educational diplomas.
Fourth round
The fourth round of dialogue was held on 17 and 18 May 2011. Agreement was almost reached on the cadaster and freedom of movement; the European Union proposed to also tackle the issues of missing people and cultural heritage.
Fifth round
The fifth round of dialogue was set to take place on 14 and 15 June 2011, but was delayed a few days before. It was assumed that the meeting would instead be held in late June, but it was pushed back to 2 July 2011. It was expected that solutions would be reached on the cadaster, freedom of movement and vital records. Electricity and telecommunications issues may also have been resolved in that round. Agreement was reached on freedom of movement across the border (both persons and cars), exchange of information regarding Serbia's civil registries to help Kosovo establish its own civil registry, and recognising each other's educational diplomas.
Sixth round
The sixth round of dialogue was set to take place on 20 and 21 July 2011. They were postponed to September on 19 July, allegedly because Kosovo's representative wanted to have Kosovo's state symbols shown, which the Serbian representative rejected. They were later set for 2 September 2011. Agreement was reached on the customs issue (the stamp will only feature the words "Customs of Kosovo") and on the cadaster; while telecommunications and university degrees were also discussed, no agreement was reached on these issues.
Seventh round
The seventh round dialogue was scheduled for 28 September 2011 (it was initially scheduled for 27 September, but was postponed shortly before due to a flare-up in violence). The Serb delegation refused to continue with the talks whilst Kosovo police and customs officials controlled border posts, which were not previously agreed upon, resulting in violence. The talks were then set for 14 October 2011, though only technical issues were planned to be discussed.
Outcome
Kosovo representatives agreed on freedom of movement across the administrative border, both for persons and cars.
Belgrade has agreed to give Pristina copies of land registries and documents on births, deaths and marriages in Kosovo.
Mutual recognition of each other's university diplomas.
Belgrade has agreed to accept Kosovo Customs stamps stating "Customs of Kosovo".
End of the trade embargo, restoring trade between the two entities.
Integrated operations at North Kosovo crossing points.
Representation of Pristina authorities at regional organizations.
Liaison officers would be exchanged between Belgrade and Pristina – to be stationed in EU missions.
Further aims
Additional agreements:
energy cooperation issues – electricity transmission, implementation of the Energy Community treaty
telecommunications issues – landline and mobile phone services in North Kosovo, roaming
Negotiations since 2013
The first stage of the dialogues 2011-2012 were referred to as the 'Technical Dialogue' and led to a significant number of technical agreements addressing the most pressing issues of concern.
The second phase, which began in 2013, is referred to as the 'High Level Dialogue' and is chaired by the High Representative-Vice President of the European Commission, with the "First Agreement of Principles Governing the Normalisation of Relations", signed on 19 April 2013, as its crowning achievement. After the signing of the agreement, the European Commission officially advised that work could start on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Kosovo and accession negotiations with Serbia.
In July 2017, the EU facilitated dialogue moved to pursuing comprehensive normalization of relations between Kosovo and Serbia.
In its 2018 strategy 'A credible enlargement perspective for and enhanced EU engagement with the Western Balkans', the European Commission wrote that, without effective and comprehensive normalization of Belgrade-Pristina relations through the EU-facilitated dialogue, there cannot be lasting stability in the region. A comprehensive, legally binding normalization agreement is urgent and crucial so that Serbia and Kosovo can advance on their respective European paths.
The lack of stability is clear due to the lack of consensus as well as an increase in violent developments. On 16 January 2018, Kosovo Serb politician, Oliver Ivanović, was assassinated in North Mitrovica and on 26 March 2018, the former Director of Serbia's Kosovo office Marko Đurić was arrested and deported after illegally entering Kosovo and attending a meeting in North Mitrovica.
From 2018 until July 2020, talks between Serbia and Kosovo halted. The negotiations ceased due to the increasing violence, particularly the expulsion of Marko Ðurić as well as the introduction of a 100% tariff on imported goods from Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina by Kosovo government. Despite the stall in negotiations, the European Union continues to support open dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia.
September 2020 talks
In July 2020, attempts were made to revitalize the negotiations by the EU. However, progress was made at the Kosovo and Serbia economic normalization agreements in Washington D.C. on 4 September 2020. While not a legally binding document, the international document provided a declaration of will and political commitment by both Kosovo and Serbia.
On 7 September 2020, Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić and Kosovo Prime Minister Avdullah Hoti met for talks in Brussels, hosted by Josep Borrell under the auspices of the European Union. At a press conference after the talks, EU Special Representative for the Serbia-Kosovo dialogue Miroslav Lajčák stated that "full progress" had been made in the areas of economic cooperation, missing persons and displaced people. Vučić and Hoti met again in Brussels on 28 September 2020 where they discussed arrangements for minority communities, the settlement of mutual financial claims and property and attempted to make progress towards a more comprehensive agreement.

Plot
Pandi is a shy young man. He is the son of the village's bigwig Azhagarsamy. Pandi slowly falls in love with the lovely village girl Easwari who, unlike him, is from a poor family. When the village blacksmith Marudhu learns about their love affair, he warns Pandi about Azhagarsamy's dark side.
In the past, Kasthuri, her parents (M. N. Rajam and T. K. S. Chandran), and Ramaiah lived together in their big house. Maruthu worked in their house and had much respect for Kasthuri. However, when Kasthuri's cousin Durairasu entered their house in order to marry Kasthuri, problems started. Kasthuri's father halfheartedly accepted the proposal as per the village custom, despite knowing that Durairasu was a bad person. However, Kasthuri refused the proposal and revealed she wanted to marry Maruthu, who was from another caste. Kasthuri's family accepted her wish, and she married Marudhu. At the village court the village heads did not accept the marriage because of the caste difference and Azhagarsamy ordered Kasthuri's father to kill his daughter to restore the village's honour. Later that night, Kasthuri's father fed Kasthuri a meal which he had poisoned. Marudhu came to save Kasthuri, but Durairasu and his henchmen stopped him. Marudhu beats them all, but was too late to save Kasthuri.
Pandi loses hope in being able to marry Easwari, and the lovers decide to kill themselves. The villagers intervene just in time, and Azhagarsamy surprisingly accepts for the marriage in front of the villagers. Later, Azhagarsamy forces Kaliappan to poison his daughter Easwari. Marudhu comes in time to save her, and he encourages Ramaiah to fight against the caste fanatic Azhagarsamy. Pandi and Easwari then marry. Kasthuri's father, Ramaiah, Kaliappan, and Marudhu collaborate to destroy Azhagarsamy, forcing him to drink poison for his crimes.

St. Lawrence is a town located on the Burin Peninsula of Newfoundland and Labrador. As of the 2021 Canadian Census, the population of St. Lawrence was 1,115, down from the 2011 Canadian Census of 1,244. Popular family names in the town include Turpin, Tarrant, Slaney, Pike, Lake, Drake and Edwards.
History
St. Lawrence was named by a group of shipwrecked sailors who came to the Newfoundland in 1583 with Sir Humphrey Gilbert. During the expedition, their vessel, Delight, sank off Sable Island. Sixteen of her crew drifted in a lifeboat for seven days before coming ashore on the South Coast in Little St. Lawrence. Richard Clarke, the master of the doomed ship, wrote a dramatic account of the event in 1584.
The area was known to English, French, and Basque fishermen in the 1500s and there were a few French stages at St Lawrence itself, for the early French ship fishermen for the fishing season. However, settlement actually began in the early to mid-1700s. Captain James Cook surveyed the St. Lawrence area and vicinity in 1765. St. Lawrence was a hive of activity in 1784 when Newmans opened its store in Little St. Lawrence and business was soon rivalling that of St. John's (the capital city). Newmans closed its Little St. Lawrence store in 1811.
On 18 November 1929, a tsunami struck the area following the 1929 Grand Banks earthquake; 27 people lost their lives, and many along the coast lost their houses, boats, stages and supplies.
USS Pollux and USS Truxtun
On 18 February 1942, over 200 American sailors died when ran aground near Chambers Cove and ran aground at Lawn Point. Tremendous community efforts and personal bravery by the citizens of Lawn and St. Lawrence reduced the high death toll. Residents of St. Lawrence and Lawn saved approximately 200 sailors.
In 1954 the U.S. Navy built a hospital at St. Lawrence in gratitude for their work.
In 1992, a memorial entitled 'Echoes of Valour' was erected in dedication of the mining industry in St. Lawrence, the sailors who died in the disasters, and those who lost their lives in the world wars.
Demographics
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, St. Lawrence had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
Economy
Fishing was the main economic activity of the area for hundreds of years due to the proximity of St. Lawrence with the Grand Banks. The November 1929 tsunami "added greatly to the hardship already inflicted by the Great Depression and the collapse of the saltfish trade", according to Heritage Newfoundland.
Fluorspar (also called fluorite) deposits had been noted as early as 1843 but it was not until 1933 that mining began. The operation was started by American Walter Siebert whose company was named the St. Lawrence Corporation of Newfoundland. Backbreaking work and no pay initially, finally led to a more significant mine by 1937; a second mine also opened in 1937, the American Newfoundland Fluorspar Company.
The fluorspar mines in St. Lawrence were major employers until business declined in the 1970s; the mines had closed by 1978. The most noteworthy heritage was the "numerous deaths associated with fluorspar mining, and the physical and social costs of widespread industrial disease", according to a Heritage Newfoundland report. The author of a book published in 2019 spoke of the "deaths and serious injuries from the beginning in a manifestly unsafe workplace" in an interview with Maclean's. Lung cancer "caused by radioactivity-laced water piled onto the other lung and heart disorders initiated by the dust" led to 313 deaths over the decades, he said.
In 2011 Canada Fluorspar Inc. outlined preparations to open a fluorspar mine on the site of the old mine. The federal government provided $5 million in funding in 2017 and the provincial government provided a loan of $17 million to finance the re-opening. Production finally commenced in mid-2018. In spring 2019, the company was planning to develop a new shipping port on the west side of Burin Peninsula as a more affordable means of moving their product to markets. The company believed that the port would also allow for shipping aggregates and the company president said that it would allow for fluorspar operations to continue for ten years longer than the previously-predicted eight years.
A wind project was initiated by the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador for St. Lawrence. The project resulted in the installation of nine Vestas V90-3MW wind turbines. As of September 2019, all nine were operational.
A plan to develop a major industrial park enabled the town to obtain $1.3 million in funding from the provincial and federal government, combined, to develop eight fully service lots. The 2019 plan stalled in September, however. At the time, some argued that the fluorspar mine was not adding enough to the local economy.
On February 21, 2022, Canada Fluorspar Inc. announced that they were going bankrupt. On that day, a total of 280 employees were laid off. On March 6, the provincial government reached a financing agreement with Bridging Finance Ltd. in an attempt to find a new buyer.
Education
St. Lawrence has a K-12 School, St. Lawrence Academy. The school was initially the high school for the town "St. Lawrence Central High School". With dwindling enrollment in the 1990s the school was renamed St. Lawrence Academy and encompassed K-6 upon the closure of Marion Elementary in 1999.
Sport
St. Lawrence has been referred to as the 'Soccer Capital of Canada'. St. Lawrence Centennial Soccer Field has been listed on the Historic Places in Canada since 2005.
The St. Lawrence soccer teams have been a powerhouse of soccer both on the Burin Peninsula where they have dominated. As well at the provincial level success has also been achieved culminating in the Laurentians being named the "Team of the Decade" for the 70's and 90's.
The town has nine organized soccer teams. The St. Lawrence Laurentians soccer club is the most recognized.
Climate
St. Lawrence has a subarctic climate, albeit an ocean moderated one more akin to a subpolar oceanic climate or to the even more similar climate of the Kuril Islands off Eurasia than one like that of Fairbanks, Alaska. The seasonal lag rivals that of the Pacific coast in California, with August being the warmest month and September and July having very similar temperatures. The coldest month is February. Summer lasts from mid-July through mid-September and winter lasts from late November through early May.

Mars Argo is a American singer, songwriter, actress, and internet personality Brittany Alexandria Sheets.
Sheets is prominently known for her portrayal of fictionalized stage personas of herself on YouTube. She became known as the lead singer of the indie rock band Mars Argo, named after her main stage persona. Mars Argo released their debut album, Technology Is a Dead Bird, on November 6, 2009. The band continued to release extended plays such as Internet Sessions and Linden Place throughout 2010 and 2011. In a 2013 Vice article, the band stated that they were working on their own TV show along with a second album, but both projects were later abandoned.
Besides releasing music, Sheets co-produced, wrote, and directed content for her YouTube channel, once co-operated by her former partner Titanic Sinclair (real name Corey Michael Mixter). The channel's content was often satirical, revolving around society and Internet culture. However, after the duo broke up, all but three videos were removed from the channel. The only videos that still remain on her grocerybagdottv (renamed shouldicleanmyroom in 2022) channel to this day are the music videos for "Using You", "Runaway Runaway", and a satirical video called "Delete Your Facebook".
Early life
Brittany Alexandria Sheets was born in Saginaw, Michigan. Growing up, she played piano and sang in her church choir. She has stated that her mother never allowed her to play video games as a child, believing that they were a distraction from her studies. Before launching the YouTube project grocerybagdottv, Sheets attended university and was pursuing a major in biology.
Career
2009–2011: Career beginnings, Technology Is a Dead Bird, and Computer Show
After meeting Corey Mixter (P.K.A. Titanic Sinclair) on Myspace, they cameoed and worked on the YouTube channel titled digitalfuntown. Sheets and Mixter later formed the alternative pop band Mars Argo. They also co-operated a YouTube channel under the title Grocerybagdottv, where they uploaded music-related content and a series of social commentary videos, dubbed Computer Show. Their most popular non-music video is a 2014 episode of this series, titled "Delete Your Facebook", mocking social media usage and the website of the same name. The music video for "Using You", the most well known single from the project, already counts more than 21 million views on the channel.
The band released their debut album, Technology Is a Dead Bird, on November 6, 2009. It was followed up with an acoustic EP, Internet Sessions, in 2010, and another EP, Linden Place, in 2011. They began working on an eventually scrapped and heavily delayed second album with Chicago-based producer, Johnny K, soon after Technology Is a Dead Bird was released.
2015–2019: Mars Argo breaks up
Sheets and Mixter moved to Los Angeles in 2012, where they filmed and released the remainder of the YouTube channel's uploads, followed by the romantic separation of the couple in 2014. The band continued to perform during the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, before going on a hiatus, being briefly revived in December of the same year, although permanently splitting up sometime in March 2015. According to a 2018 lawsuit filed by Sheets, the dissolvement of both the relationship and band was due to Mixter's incessant verbal abuse and physical violence.
Sheets resurfaced in April 2018, by addressing her absence, and promising new music in the future to her fans.
2020–present: Dinner in America, Angry and future projects
Sheets portrayed Sissy in the film Dinner in America alongside Kyle Gallner, Emily Skeggs, Pat Healy, Griffin Gluck, Lea Thompson, and Mary Lynn Rajskub. The film was filmed in Detroit, Michigan and was selected to premiere at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival. On April 25, 2022, Sheets released her debut solo single, titled "Angry".
Lawsuit against Sinclair and Poppy
In 2018, Sheets filed a lawsuit against Mixter and his collaborator at the time, Poppy (real name Moriah Rose Pereira). The lawsuit details her experiences of physical and emotional abuse from Mixter and her artistic identity and likeness being stolen. The lawsuit was settled out of court.
On April 17, 2018, after a period of little to no activity, Sheets filed a 44-page lawsuit against Mixter and his collaborator at the time Poppy (real name Moriah Rose Pereira) alleging copyright infringement, stalking, and emotional and physical abuse being inflicted upon her by the two. That same day, Argo posted a message on her social media pages addressing the lawsuit, thanking her fans for their support and confirming new music to come. On May 7, Poppy made a public statement about the "frivolous" lawsuit, stating that Argo was attempting to manipulate her psychologically. She called the suit a "publicity campaign" and a "desperate grab for fame".
The lawsuit was dismissed on September 14, having been settled outside of court with agreements that Mixter and Pereira would not be in contact with Sheets, and with Sheets gaining all rights, title and interest to the Mars Argo music and brand. Pereira later publicly split with Mixter in December 2019, and alleged that she was a victim of "manipulative patterns" by him. However, Pereira has never publicly retracted her initial statements regarding the lawsuit and insists she was "never controlled" by Mixter, further stating that "he didn't want to make YouTube videos, but [she] begged him".

Willi (Willie) Huttig (28 March 1909 – 27 December 2001) was a German photographer and alpinist.
Early life
Willi (referred to as 'Willie' in English references) Huttig was born on 28 March 28 1909 in Chodov in Bohemia (today in the Czech Republic) into a significant regional photographic family. His grandfather, Wenzl Fritsch (1842–1916), founded the first photographic studio in the region in 1884 and by the beginning of the 20th century owned and operated photographic studios, in addition to the original in Chodov, in Karlovy Vary, Drahovice, Stará Role, Loket and Jáchymov. After the death of Wenzl Fritsch during the First World War, his son, Willi Fritsch took on management of the company and maintained the head office in Chodov, where he built a house with a studio in what today is Tyršova Street.
Professional photographer
After 1932, the young Willi Huttig, who had worked for his grandfather and uncle, took over the management of the established company. He became a respected portraitist and also conducted business in picture postcards in partnership with Richard Wörsching who in 1932 won a contract to photograph landscapes of Starnberg and environment for advertising purposes and the sole right to photograph and film on the lake promenade and in the popular urban bathing beach of Starnberg.
By the mid-30s, in addition to his wife and assistant, Vera (and later, his son Thomas), Huttig had employed fourteen co-workers, giving him some leisure to pursue his lifelong passion as an alpinist. His pictures taken while mountain climbing garnered awards at more than twenty international exhibitions during the 1930s; in Budapest, Barcelona, Amsterdam, New York and Chicago among others.
Huttig's successful career was interrupted by the World War II, in which he participated as a photographer at the front. After returning post-war to Chodov, which had been annexed by Nazi Germany as part of the Sudetenland, and from which all Germans were being expelled, he found his shop confiscated. He managed to secure work with an American military crew and left with them for Germany at the end of 1945. With him he took only two cameras and a few of his pre-war images and negatives, leaving everything else in his house in Tyršova Street. In Germany he worked as a photographer for the US Army magazine Stars and Stripes. In 1947 he settled at Hauptstraße 25, Starnberg on the Starnberger See (lake) in Upper Bavaria 25 km from Munich, at the foothills of the Alps, and there opened a photographic studio.
Recognition
In 1955 Huttig's photograph of a priest officiating at a funeral in the snow, surrounded by mourners under umbrellas, was featured in MoMA's world-touring The Family of Man exhibition, curated by Edward Steichen, which was seen by nine million visitors.
In 1959 he photographed Pvt Elvis Presley during his stint with the US Army's Armored Division in Germany. Elvis used a three-day pass to visit Munich and Huttig was contracted to make publicity shots of him with 18-year-old German actress Vera Tschechowa, which were important for keeping alive Elvis' reputation with his fans during his army service years.
During his life, Huttig won awards at forty-eight international exhibitions around the world. His work is held in the collection of the Museum Folkwang, Museumsplatz 1, 45128 Essen.

Mountaineer
Willi Huttig was a keen mountaineer. For the Starnberg section of the Alpine trail in 1968, as its first chairman, he acquired a high-alpine hut, the Hohenzollernhaus at 2123 m. After negotiations with the main committee of the Deutsche Alpenverein (DAV) and its Berlin section, the Starnberg section was able to purchase the Hohenzollernhaus in 1978, and after renovations made it the first DAV hut and a vital asset in mountain rescues.

Japanese War Bride (also known as East is) is a 1952 drama film directed by King Vidor. The film featured the American debut of Shirley Yamaguchi in the title role. In February 2020, the film was shown at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, as part of a retrospective dedicated to King Vidor's career.
Synopsis
A wounded Korean War veteran, Jim Sterling (Don Taylor), returns to his California home with his Japanese wife. The couple had met and fallen in love in a Japanese hospital where Tae Shimizu (Shirley Yamaguchi) was working as a nurse. Back in America, the couple face racism and bigotry from their neighbors and family, particularly their sister-in-law, Fran (Marie Windsor).
Impact and legacy
The widespread publicity surrounding the film's launch made Japanese wives increasingly visible in the United States. Along with The Teahouse of the August Moon and the more successful film Sayonara, Japanese War Bride was argued by some scholars to have increased racial tolerance in the United States by openly discussing interracial marriages.

The D.C. Nine were nine men and women, including seven who were priests and nuns, who engaged in a daytime protest against the Dow Chemical Company and its production of napalm and were charged with malicious destruction of property and unlawful entry. They attempted to present a political defense, but the judge instructed the jury, "The Vietnam War is not an issue in this case. You are not trying ideas. You are not trying the United States. You are not trying society...Therefore, if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that one or more of the defendants had the required intent to commit one or more of the offenses with which they are charged, then it is no defense that he or she also had one or more other intentions, reasons, purposes or motives, such as to protest against the Vietnam War or the activities of the Dow Company; nor is it a defense that he or she acted from sincere, religious motives, or that he or she believed that his or her intent was justified by some higher law." The defendants were also not allowed to proceed pro se, since the judge was concerned that they would disrupt the proceedings. They were convicted, but were granted new trials due to the denial of their right to self-representation. Their appellate case, United States v. Dougherty, had important implications for the jurisprudence surrounding jury nullification.

Ricardo P Lloyd (born 20 November 1993) is a British actor and presenter. He began his career in theatre, appearing in productions, including those by Shakespeare's Globe. In 2020, The Voice named him one of the Top 20 to watch out for. In 2022, Lloyd presented and produced his own documentary for BBC Radio 4.
Early life and education
Ricardo P Lloyd was born on 20 November 1993 in Ipswich, England. His grandparents were a part of the Windrush generation, migrating from Jamaica to England.
Lloyd moved from Ipswich to London with his mother when he was very young. He grew up in the London Borough of Brent, attending Kensal Rise Primary School now known as Ark Franklin Primary Academy. In his teenage years, he went to the secondary school Capital City Academy, and performed in school productions of Bugsy Malone and West Side Story.
He then went down a bad path, hanging around with the wrong crowds trying to fit in, which led him to get into some fights and failing most of his GCSEs. Lloyd later turned his life around, staying at the school's sixth-form to retake some GCSEs and do an A-Level in drama.
However, staff continued to stereotype him. Lloyd eventually left Capital City Academy's sixth-form to pursue a BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma in performing arts acting at Harrow College (2011–2013). The actor then went on to Buckinghamshire New University to study Performing Arts; Film TV & Stage at undergraduate level (2013–2016). After Lloyd received his BA Honours degree in 2016, he then did an MBA at Anglia Ruskin University (2016–2018) to enhance his skills in business.
Career
Lloyd began his acting career in theatre, performing in various theatre shows. He then appeared in several short films. He made his professional stage debut in 2015 in a production of Animal Farm at Oxford House (settlement).
Lloyd subsequently starred in the short film University Life (2015) where he played the (lead) protagonist Anthony. The film was a runner-up in a BIFA short film competition. In February 2016, Lloyd played Karam in the show Fragile things performed at the Wycombe Swan Theatre. In the same year, he filmed a part in a short film titled Cussin.
In April 2019, Lloyd acted in Shakespeare Walks, where he took on the role of Snug (A Midsummer Night's Dream). He also performed in Shakespeare within the Abbey, produced by Shakespeare's Globe. Lloyd worked alongside Oscar-winning actor Mark Rylance and his wife Claire van Kampen. These shows were created to celebrate Shakespeare's birthday, brought alive by a company of different actors.
"one of the most moving celebrations of Shakespeare I've experienced" – Michael Billington The GuardianIn November 2019, Lloyd portrayed Romeo in the critically acclaimed topical (theatre) production Excluded, produced by Intermission Theatre. The play transplanted and re-imagined some of Shakespeare's iconic characters into a London secondary school as they prepared for their GCSEs, highlighting how the education system fails many young people. Lloyd received much praise for his performance.
On 3 November 2019, Lloyd made an appearance on BBC One's Sunday Morning Live season 10, episode 20, presented by Sean Fletcher. Lloyd performed a scene from Excluded with fellow cast and was then interviewed by Ria Hebden. He was seen wearing an eye patch with the word 'excluded' on it, created for him by British artist Eugene Ankomah. When interviewed by Vanessa Feltz on her BBC Radio London breakfast radio show (23 October 2019) what it meant, Lloyd said it was a symbol to represent how society "only chooses to see what they want to see concerning young people" or people who come from where he does.
Lloyd also appeared on ITV News London, where he candidly spoke out on the effects of school exclusions, saying: "When you exclude a child, you are essentially saying they're not good enough for society." He added, "A lot of my peers who have been excluded ended up in prison or dead."
Lloyd has a number of further credits. He worked on Creation Theatre Company's The Time Machine: A Virtual Reality (2020) in the West End. Lloyd performed at the Lyric Theatre as part of the Evolution festival (2020). He also starred in the documentary film Arts hole (2020), which he co-produced with Wendy Richardson and Tara Dominick. Lloyd appeared in Kar-go's promotional video for autonomous delivery UK launch (2020).
In 2021, Lloyd wrote, acted, produced and filmed his own short film titled Call It A Problem, to inspire youth and the community during the COVID-19 pandemic, teaming up with charities The People's FC and Teviot Rangers JFC.
Lloyd starred in the short film Con-Spiracies (2021), produced by the National Film and Television School, where he played lead character Jaden. He also performed a monologue to a select audience for the virtual event My Story, My Monologue hosted by BlackRock with thousands of employees watching.
In January 2022, it was announced that Lloyd would narrate the audiobook of the crime novel Silenced by Jennie Ensor.
On Saturday, 9 April 2022, Lloyd played John Blanke at the National Maritime Museum part of the Caribbean Takeover celebrating black history. The event was an opportunity for visitors to discover the fusion of cultures from Africa, the Caribbean and Britain. It was the first time in the museum's history that an event was held of that magnitude celebrating black history. Lloyd was joined by other notable public figures including ITVThe Chase's Shaun Wallace, as well as Leroy Logan.

In November 2021, The Guardian published an article that focused on Lloyd and actor David Harewood, comparing the actors' lives and careers. This was part of Black British culture matters, curated by Lenny Henry and Marcus Ryder for The Guardian's Saturday Culture Issue No 7.
On 28 August 2022, Lloyd won the Anglia Ruskin University Vice counsellor alumni Contribution to Culture award.Lloyd was recognised and celebrated by Your Brent Magazine for Black History Month 2022 as one of the Black British stars from brent making an impact.

Lloyd spoke boldly about the challenges many black British actors face in the industry. In 2021, he wrote an article for The Independent extensively discussing some of his own experiences of discrimination being a black British actor. He has also written articles for various publications including Radio Times, The Big Issue, The Voice ,Student Pocket Guide.
Personal life
Lloyd is a practicing Christian, he has spoken openly about how importance his faith is to him on platforms like Premier Christian Radio, saying it keeps him grounded.
In 2021, he told Church Times:
"Faith has enabled me to survive in this business: faith in God through Christ Jesus. I trust in him that he has a purpose regarding my life and career, and he knows what is best for me. I also need to have faith in myself, my abilities, my value. I have business skill-sets to help me create my own work. I no longer want to just survive, but thrive. I'm also trying to help other people who come from where I come from."
Lloyd revealed his favourite actor of all time is Sidney Poitier. He wrote a tribute to Poitier after hearing of his passing in January 2022, which was published by The Voice. He also is a fan of Michael Jackson since childhood and has said that Michael Jackson's life, career, artistry (work) has greatly inspired him.

Lloyd then found himself going through a dark period becoming homeless and going through different traumatic experiences. Lloyd spoke out about the lack of support many black men face.
The stories kept on circulating about the actor: "Police appeal after actor is attacked by unknown woman in Lambeth."
One journalist added: "Because of his facial scars Ricardo will also have to step away from the camera and put his acting career on pause."

Henry Fox (30 September 1856 – on or after 30 August 1888) was an English businessman, sportsman, and adventurer. He played cricket and rugby for his county, and began climbing mountains in the mid-1880s. He was part of the Fox family of Wellington, Somerset, and was a partner in the family business, Fox Brothers, a prominent textile manufacturer.
Fox played and financed cricket and rugby in Somerset; he played cricket for Somerset County Cricket Club from 1877 to 1882, and remained as a vice-president of the club until his death. He founded Wellington Rugby Football Club in 1874, and was an administrator and captain of the Somerset Rugby Football Union. After retiring as a rugby player, he continued to take part as an umpire. In 1884 he started mountaineering, and within two years he was well known in the mountain climbing community, and a well-regarded alpine explorer. In 1888, he and William Frederick Donkin travelled to the Caucasus Mountains in the Russian Empire in a bid to be the first ones to climb Koshtan-Tau. The pair, along with their Swiss guides, died in an accident during the expedition.
Early life and sporting exploits
Henry Fox was born on 30 September 1856 as the second son of Dillworth Crewdson and Mary Augusta. He was educated at Sherborne School. His family owned Fox Brothers, of which he became a partner. In 1874, he founded Wellington Rugby Football Club. Three years later, he became the honorary secretary, treasurer and captain of the Somerset county rugby football team upon its formation. He was captain in both 1877 and 1878, playing as a three-quarter back, and remained secretary and treasurer until 1882. After retiring from the game, he continued as an umpire. Fox appeared in his final match in 1887, officiating the game between Somerset and Yorkshire.
As well as rugby, Fox also played cricket for his county, first appearing for Somerset County Cricket Club in 1877 during a match against Wiltshire. He tended to play as a lower-order batsmen for the county. His highest score in county cricket was 42 runs, made against Kent in 1881, prior to Somerset's elevation to first-class status. In June 1882, he was part of the Somerset team that competed in first-class cricket for the first time, losing by an innings and 157 runs to Lancashire; Fox scored no runs in either innings, and did not bowl. He made two further first-class appearances that season, and did not appear for Somerset again, due to business engagements. In all, he scored sixteen runs in first-class matches for Somerset at an average of 2.66. After retiring as a player, Fox continued to provide financial support to the cricket club, and remained a vice-president until his death.
Fox was also a keen mountaineer; having started mountain climbing in 1884, he joined the Alpine Club the following year. He received training initially from William Woodman Graham and then William Cecil Slingsby. According to an article in The Times, he was well regarded by his peers as "a climber of great skill and daring". He was a very experienced alpine climber, and often climbed without guides, ascending Aiguille du Dru, Fletschhorn, Ober Gabelhorn amongst others in this fashion. With guides, he climbed some of the toughest mountains in the Alps, such as the Matterhorn and the Eiger.
Death in the Caucasus Mountains
Fox left Wellington in late July 1888 for the Caucasus Mountains in the Russian Empire, joining up with William Frederick Donkin and Clinton Dent. The three were aiming to become the first climbers to scale Koshtan-Tau, one of the few mountains in the region yet to be scaled. The three started from Nalchik, though Dent was forced to return home due to ill-health, leaving Fox and Donkin to attempt the climb, along with two Swiss guides. Their initial plan was to climb a glacier on the northern slopes of the mountain, and then make their final ascent on the western side. However, a rock wall on the western slopes prevented this, and they changed their plans to attack the mountain from the east. They planned to meet up with their outfitter to the south-east of the mountain, but after they missed that meeting, a message was sent back to Dent reporting the climbers missing. The Times reported on 6 October that Donkin and Fox, along with their guides, had suffered a mountaineering accident that had led "to the almost certain loss of four lives".
Multiple searches were carried out, including one on the direct order of Tsar Alexander III, but no evidence was found. The Russians did recover items from the climbers' base camp, including Fox's diary. Russian authorities, possibly for political reasons, claimed that the climbing party may have probably strayed into Svaneti, Georgia, and may have been murdered by the local population, who had rebelled against the Russians not long before. In 1889, Dent and Douglas Freshfield led an expedition to search the area. Although they were unable to find any remains, they did discover a bivouac at around on the Ullu-auz pass between two glaciers. They recovered a number of personal items from the camp, but found that light climbing gear – rope, ice axes and a camera – were missing. The search party concluded that Donkin and Fox had continued their climb, intending to return to the bivouac, but had fallen while navigating a narrow ridge higher up the mountain. Such a fall would have been thousands of feet, and the winter snow would have covered the climbers' bodies. So despite conducting a search of the valley floor, no bodies were recovered.
For the purposes of his will, Fox's death was recorded as being "on or since the 30th August, 1888, at some place unknown." The value of his personal estate was just over £7,639. As he was not married and had no children, his estate was shared between his eldest brother, Charles Dillworth, and his four sisters, Sarah, Anna, Alice and Louisa. A cricket pavilion was erected in his memory at Wellington Cricket Club in Somerset, and a mountain in the Dawson Range in Canada was named Mount Fox in his honour.

Oberdiessbach Castle (also called Neues Schloss) is a castle in the municipality of Oberdiessbach of the Canton of Bern in Switzerland. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.
History
The town of Oberdiessbach (known as Diessbach until 1870) was the center of the late medieval Herrschaft of Diessbach. The first castle in the area, Diessenberg on the Falkenfluh was built above the town and was destroyed in 1331. In 1546 Niklaus von Diesbach built the Alte Schloss (Old Castle) on the valley floor near the town. In 1666, near the Old Castle, construction began on the Neue Schloss or New Castle for Albrecht von Wattenwyl (1617-1671). Albrecht von Wattenwyl had been a commander of the Swiss Guard in service to the French king. So, he had the castle built in the French late Renaissance style. It was built by the Neuchatel architect Jonas Favre. The castle exterior remained generally unchanged after initial construction finished in 1668. The only major changes occurred around 1720, when the gate house was converted into a prison and in the 1850s when the garden was redone in the English style. The garden remained an English garden until 2005 when it was converted back into a Baroque style garden.
The castle today
Today Oberdiessbach Castle remains the home of the von Wattenwyl family. Groups may tour the castle from April until October with prior arraignments. Some rooms in the castle and the gardens can be rented for events. Every July there are several Jazz concerts in the castle gardens as part of the Castle Jazz Festival. The castle is surrounded by a of working farms.

Endorectal coil magnetic resonance imaging or endorectal coil MRI is a type of medical imaging in which MRI is used in conjunction with a coil placed into the rectum in order to obtain high quality images of the area surrounding the rectum. The technique has demonstrated higher accuracy than other modalities in assessing seminal vesicle invasion and extra-capsular extension (ECE) of prostate cancer (96% and 81% respectively). Endorectal coil MRI is useful for determining the extent of spread and local invasion of cancers of the prostate, rectum, and anus. The coil consists of a probe with an inflatable balloon which helps maintain appropriate positioning. Similar coils may be used vaginally for evaluating cervical cancer.

Pampatar is a city on Isla Margarita, Nueva Esparta State, Venezuela. It is located in the Maneiro Municipality.
Pampatar lies 10 km (6 mi) northeast of Porlamar.
A coastal town which was founded 1552. Its strategic importance becomes clear when visiting the Castillo de San Carlos de Borromeo on the waterfront in the center of town. Constructed entirely of coral, the fort, built by the Spanish in 1662 after the original was destroyed by the Dutch. In the center of town is the Iglesia Santísimo Cristo or Iglesia del Cristo del Buen viaje, which features a bell tower with an outside staircase — an architectural oddity found on several churches on Isla Margarita. Nowadays this town is very famous for its malls (Sambil or Rattan Plaza) and its commercial activity 24 hours a day.

The Simpleton (, translated also as The Muff) is the debut novel by Alexei Pisemsky, written in the late 1840 and first published in October and November 1850 by Moskvityanin. The novel has met critical acclaim and made Pisemsky a popular author.
Background
In his autobiography Pisemsky wrote: "In 1846 I completed a large novel called Boyarschina. In 1847 I sent it to Otechestvennye Zapiski and it was banned by the censors. By this time, while in the country, I've written another novel, Tyufyak, but, defeated already in my aspirations, decided against sending it [to the publishers] and resumed my state service." Here Pisemsky got the date wrong: Boyarshina was sent to OZ in 1848 and, as the Soviet scholar Mikhail Eryomin noted, "there are reasons to believe that The Simpleton rough copy was ready in 1848, too."
In the Stellovsky Publishers's (Saint Petersburg, 1861) edition the novel came out as dated "29 April 1850". On April 21, Pisemsky wrote to Alexander Ostrovsky: "I send you, my dear Alexander Nikolayevich, my book for you to decide what to do with it. I gave it the title "The Family Dramas" (Семейные драмы), but should it appear to be incompatible either with the censorial demands or the magazine's general mood, please change it to whatever you like: "Bashmetyev", "The Muff", whatever. I send you only the first part of it, but rest assured, the second one is ready, just needs some polishing done."
Pisemsky was working upon the second part through the summer of 1850. He formulated the novel's general idea in his April 21 letter to Ostrovsky:
The Simpleton passed the censorship without trouble. On 4 September Mikhail Pogodin received the rest of the manuscript and the magazine published the novel in its October and November 1850 issues.
Reception
The early reviews of The Simpleton were positive, although, coming from different literary camps, each carried its own ideological agenda. The anonymous Otechestvennye Zapiski reviewer called it the best work of fiction published in Russia in 1850 and praised the author's "gift for depicting the real life, backed up by serious attitude."
Alexander Druzhinin in his otherwise warm review found the Mansurov character too similar to Gogol's Nozdryov (Otechestvennye Zapiskis reviewer agreed with him on that). Druzhinin stated that Pisemsky rather "spoiled the character of Beshmetyev… by giving him some trivial, hackneyed qualities" and found The Simpleton not entertaining enough. Disputing some of Vissarion Belinsky's ideas, the critic suggested that the formula of success was, "simplicity of details, intricacy of fantasy," something that he deemed Pisemsky's novel, apparently, as lacking.
Critic Stepan Dudyshkin in his "Russian Literature in 1850" review found Pisemsky's debut novel's characters too grotesque, Bashmetyev's major weakness being his "inability to act." Alexander Ostrovsky in his large essay published in Moskvityanin, praised the novel's originality. Several years later Apollon Grigoriev, reviewing several Pisemsky's books argued that The Simpleton (unlike his later stories) had nothing to do with Gogol's school of realism.
After the 1861 release of the first volume of the Stellovsky's edition of Pisemsky's Selected Works, Dmitry Pisarev subjected the novel to thorough analysis in the article called "Silent Waters". The radical critic's general verdict was that the novel's idea was to show that the Russians, leading the kind of lives they do lead, were "ignorant of the better options and incapable to recognize the very extent of their own suffering."

Gerrit Van Niekerk Viljoen (11 September 1926 in Cape Town – 29 March 2009) was a South African government minister and member of the National Party.
He was chair of the Broederbond from 1974 to 1980, Administrator-General of South West Africa from 1979 to 1980, Minister of Education in South Africa from 1980 to 1989, and Minister of Constitutional Development from 1989 to 1992.
Early life
He was born in Cape Town in 1926, the son of Helena and Hendrik Geldenhuys Viljoen, the editor of Huisgenoot magazine. He attended Afrikaanse Hoër Seunskool (Afrikaans High School for Boys, also known as Affies), a popular and renowned public school located in Pretoria. He continued his studies at the University of Pretoria. Here he was elected to the Student Representative Council and in 1948 was a founder of the Union of Afrikaans students.
He studied classical literature and philosophy at the University of Cambridge, then at the University of Leiden, where he passed his PhD summa cum laude. On returning to South Africa, he worked at the University of Pretoria and in 1967 was named vice-chancellor of the Rand Afrikaans University.
Political career
In 1974, he succeeded Andries Treurnicht as chair of the Broederbond, an influential organisation of Afrikaners, of which almost all South African government ministers of the time were members.
In 1979, he was appointed Administrator-General of South West Africa, and in 1980 joined the government of P. W. Botha as Minister of Education.
In 1989, he became Minister of Constitutional Development in the government of F. W. de Klerk. As a senior ideologue and spokesman of the National Party, he investigated several constitutional models for a "new South Africa", and took part in the first official negotiations with the African National Congress in May 1990 after the release of political prisoners including Nelson Mandela. During the CODESA negotiations he championed the idea of "group rights", differentiating them from "individual rights", and saw them as a way to entrench the rights of South African groups, including the white minority. He retired from politics and government in 1992 for reasons of health.
Gerrit Viljoen was the father of seven children.

Parliamentary elections were held in Nauru on April 26, 2008, following the dissolving of Parliament by President Marcus Stephen on April 18. The decision came after what Stephen referred to as "months of political deadlock". Of the parliament's eighteen members, nine supported the Stephen government and nine were in opposition.
Events leading to election
The deadlock had been exacerbated by a crisis between the President and the Speaker of Parliament, Opposition member David Adeang. On March 22, Adeang had called a Parliamentary session, allegedly without informing government ministers, who therefore did not attend. Opposition MPs, Adeang included, constituted a majority of legislators present, and passed a ruling outlawing dual citizenship for Members of Parliament. The ruling, if applied, would have affected senior Cabinet ministers Dr. Kieren Keke and Frederick Pitcher. Had they been compelled to resign from Parliament, the Opposition would have controlled a majority of seats in Parliament. The law was overturned as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, and Adeang subsequently sought to suspend all pro-government MPs from Parliament, citing their allegedly "unruly behaviour". A week later, Stephen dissolved Parliament.
Two observers from the Pacific Islands Forum were present to monitor the election, at the request of the Nauruan government.
There were 65 candidates for the 18 seats, among whom were former Presidents Ludwig Scotty and René Harris.
Results
All nine supporters of Stephen (Stephen himself, Kieren Keke, Mathew Batsiua, Roland Kun, Frederick Pitcher, Sprent Dabwido, former Speaker Riddell Akua, Dominic Tabuna and Rykers Solomon) were reelected, while three opposition MPs (former President René Harris, Cyril Buraman and Fabian Ribauw) lost their seats; the government claims it has thus won the election. Indeed, all three newly elected MPs joined the government and thereby ended the legislative deadlock. The new parliament was expected to hold its first session on 29 April 2008.

A non-inertial reference frame is a frame of reference that undergoes acceleration with respect to an inertial frame. An accelerometer at rest in a non-inertial frame will, in general, detect a non-zero acceleration. While the laws of motion are the same in all inertial frames, in non-inertial frames, they vary from frame to frame depending on the acceleration.
In classical mechanics it is often possible to explain the motion of bodies in non-inertial reference frames by introducing additional fictitious forces (also called inertial forces, pseudo-forces and d'Alembert forces) to Newton's second law. Common examples of this include the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force. In general, the expression for any fictitious force can be derived from the acceleration of the non-inertial frame. As stated by Goodman and Warner, "One might say that F ma holds in any coordinate system provided the term 'force' is redefined to include the so-called 'reversed effective forces' or 'inertia forces'."
In the theory of general relativity, the curvature of spacetime causes frames to be locally inertial, but globally non-inertial. Due to the non-Euclidean geometry of curved space-time, there are no global inertial reference frames in general relativity. More specifically, the fictitious force which appears in general relativity is the force of gravity.
Avoiding fictitious forces in calculations
In flat spacetime, the use of non-inertial frames can be avoided if desired. Measurements with respect to non-inertial reference frames can always be transformed to an inertial frame, incorporating directly the acceleration of the non-inertial frame as that acceleration as seen from the inertial frame. This approach avoids use of fictitious forces (it is based on an inertial frame, where fictitious forces are absent, by definition) but it may be less convenient from an intuitive, observational, and even a calculational viewpoint. As pointed out by Ryder for the case of rotating frames as used in meteorology:
Detection of a non-inertial frame: need for fictitious forces
That a given frame is non-inertial can be detected by its need for fictitious forces to explain observed motions. For example, the rotation of the Earth can be observed using a Foucault pendulum. The rotation of the Earth seemingly causes the pendulum to change its plane of oscillation because the surroundings of the pendulum move with the Earth. As seen from an Earth-bound (non-inertial) frame of reference, the explanation of this apparent change in orientation requires the introduction of the fictitious Coriolis force.
Another famous example is that of the tension in the string between two spheres rotating about each other. In that case, prediction of the measured tension in the string based upon the motion of the spheres as observed from a rotating reference frame requires the rotating observers to introduce a fictitious centrifugal force.
In this connection, it may be noted that a change in coordinate system, for example, from Cartesian to polar, if implemented without any change in relative motion, does not cause the appearance of fictitious forces, despite the fact that the form of the laws of motion varies from one type of curvilinear coordinate system to another.
Fictitious forces in curvilinear coordinates
A different use of the term "fictitious force" often is used in curvilinear coordinates, particularly polar coordinates. To avoid confusion, this distracting ambiguity in terminologies is pointed out here. These so-called "forces" are non-zero in all frames of reference, inertial or non-inertial, and do not transform as vectors under rotations and translations of the coordinates (as all Newtonian forces do, fictitious or otherwise).
This incompatible use of the term "fictitious force" is unrelated to non-inertial frames. These so-called "forces" are defined by determining the acceleration of a particle within the curvilinear coordinate system, and then separating the simple double-time derivatives of coordinates from the remaining terms. These remaining terms then are called "fictitious forces". More careful usage calls these terms "generalized fictitious forces" to indicate their connection to the generalized coordinates of Lagrangian mechanics. The application of Lagrangian methods to polar coordinates can be found here.
Relativistic point of view
Frames and flat spacetime
If a region of spacetime is declared to be Euclidean, and effectively free from obvious gravitational fields, then if an accelerated coordinate system is overlaid onto the same region, it can be said that a uniform fictitious field exists in the accelerated frame (we reserve the word gravitational for the case in which a mass is involved). An object accelerated to be stationary in the accelerated frame will "feel" the presence of the field, and they will also be able to see environmental matter with inertial states of motion (stars, galaxies, etc.) to be apparently falling "downwards" in the field along curved trajectories as if the field is real.
In frame-based descriptions, this supposed field can be made to appear or disappear by switching between "accelerated" and "inertial" coordinate systems.
More advanced descriptions
As the situation is modeled in finer detail, using the general principle of relativity, the concept of a frame-dependent gravitational field becomes less realistic. In these Machian models, the accelerated body can agree that the apparent gravitational field is associated with the motion of the background matter, but can also claim that the motion of the material as if there is a gravitational field, causes the gravitational field - the accelerating background matter "drags light". Similarly, a background observer can argue that the forced acceleration of the mass causes an apparent gravitational field in the region between it and the environmental material (the accelerated mass also "drags light").
This "mutual" effect, and the ability of an accelerated mass to warp lightbeam geometry and lightbeam-based coordinate systems, is referred to as frame-dragging.
Frame-dragging removes the usual distinction between accelerated frames (which show gravitational effects) and inertial frames (where the geometry is supposedly free from gravitational fields). When a forcibly-accelerated body physically "drags" a coordinate system, the problem becomes an exercise in warped spacetime for all observers.

Caernarvon is a residential neighbourhood in the Castledowns area of north Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. It is named for a castle in Wales.
According to the 2001 federal census, the majority of residential construction in the neighbourhood occurred during the 1970s and early 1980s. It was during this period that approximately eight out of ten (82.1%) of the residences in the neighbourhood were built.
The neighbourhood has a mixture of housing types, according to the 2005 municipal census, with the most common type being the single-family dwelling. Approximately six out of ten residences (59%) are single-family dwellings. The next most common type of residence is the row house; row houses account for another 22% of residences. Duplexes make up another 13% of the residences. The remaining 7% is a mixture of apartment style condominiums and rented apartments, both in low rise buildings with fewer than five stories. Approximately three out of four residences (74%) are owner occupied, while the remaining one in four residences (26%) are rented.
The neighbourhood population is comparatively stable, with over half (53.6%) of residents having lived at the same address for five years or more according to the 2005 municipal census. Another 11% have lived at the same address for at least three years but less than five years. Fifteen percent of the residents have moved within the previous 12 months.
There are two schools in the neighbourhood. Caernarvon Elementary School is operated by the Edmonton Public School System and Katherine Therien Catholic School is operated by the Edmonton Catholic School System.
The neighbourhood is bounded on the north by 153 Avenue, on the east by Castledowns Road, and on the south by 145 Avenue. The boundary on the west side is approximately half a block west of 123 Street.
The community is represented by the Caernarvon Community League, established in 1974, which maintains a community hall and an outdoor rink located at 118 Street and 148 Avenue.
Demographics
In the City of Edmonton's 2012 municipal census, Caernarvon had a population of living in dwellings, a -3% change from its 2009 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of people/km2 in 2012.

Bugle Boy Industries, Inc. was a clothing company founded by Dr. William Mow in 1977. It is perhaps best known for its namesake brand of denim jeans that were popular in the 1980s. The company declared bankruptcy in 2001.
William C. W. Mow (Traditional Chinese: 毛昭寰) was born in Hangzhou, China, and later moved with his family to the United States. He graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1959 and then earned an MSEE from Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Purdue University in 1967. He worked for Litton Industries for two years before venturing out on his own. Mow founded Macrodata based on his invention of a method of testing large-scale integrated chips and the company went public in 1973. Around 1976, Mow sold his shares and left the company due to an investigation by the SEC. Although he was later cleared, he had to stay out of the electronics design industry for a few years due to a non-competition clause he had signed with Macrodata.
In 1977, Mow founded Bugle Boy Industries. During the 1980s, the company enjoyed continued growth. Sales approached $1 billion, making Bugle Boy one of the largest privately owned apparel companies in the United States, but the company fell into troubled times in 2001, declared bankruptcy, and was sold that year for $68.6 million. The Bugle Boy brand was purchased in 2001 by Schottenstein Stores Corp., owner of Retail Ventures and several retail chains.
Bugle Boy featured men's and boys' clothing, often with a denim theme. Elastic cuffs at the bottom of the jeans and cross-stitching patterns were also a major part of the Bugle Boy style, with brands such as Pilot and Cotler being its contemporaries. They also popularized parachute pants during the breakdancing fad of the early 80s, in a line called Countdown. Bugle Boy also produced men's and boys' tops, but was best known for its varieties of jeans and jean shorts. As of 2018, the Bugle Boy brand is no longer in use.
In 2001, Bugle Boy closed all 215 of its U.S. outlet stores in an agreement with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. All the operation centers in China, Taiwan, Singapore were also closed. Their store at Gurnee Mills remained open to sell off remaining inventory.

Avé de Fátima (English: Fátima Ave), also known as the Fátima Hymn, is a popular Roman Catholic Marian hymn. It is sung in honour of Our Lady of Fátima, a Catholic title of the Blessed Virgin Mary based on the Marian apparitions reported in 1917 by three shepherd children at Cova da Iria, in Fátima, Portugal.
The hymn was written in August 1929 by Portuguese poet Afonso Lopes Vieira and it was first published, anonymously ("by a Servite"), in the 13 September 1929 issue of the religious periodical Voz da Fátima. Lopes Vieira had witnessed what he later identified as the Miracle of the Sun on 13 October 1917 from the balcony of his house in São Pedro de Moel (about 50 kilometers from Fátima), alongside his wife and mother-in-law. The month he wrote the hymn, August, 1929, coincides with the conclusion of a small chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Fátima that Lopes Vieira had built in the house. The original version of the Avé de Fátima, sent to José Alves Correia da Silva, Bishop of Leiria, was set to a tune by Francisco de Lacerda.
Versions
There are several versions of the hymn in use in different parts of the world; the adaptations in different languages are set to the same tune, theme, and refrain. What follows are two English-language versions:

Thomas of Zumárraga and Lazcano (9 March 1577 – 12 September 1622) was a Roman Catholic Missionary from Spain. He was beatified in May 1867 by Pope Pius IX.
Biography
Thomas was born in Vitoria, in 1577. In 1594, he was professed in the Order of Preachers in Vitoria. After he entered the Convento de San Esteban de Salamanca, he received the name of Fray Tomás del Espíritu Santo (Brother Thomas of the Holy Spirit). In 1601, he was sent to Mexico en route to the Philippines. Shortly after arriving, in 1603, Fray Francisco Morales, superior of the Dominicans in Manila, sent him to Japan to found a mission..
He hid in the mountains, in the area of Nagasaki and Ōmura. He was captured on 23 July 1617. After five years of imprisonment, he was burnt alive on 12 September 1622.

"The Santa Simulation" is the eleventh episode of the sixth season of the American comedy television series The Big Bang Theory. The episode was originally aired on the CBS television network on December 13, 2012. The story was created by Chuck Lorre, Eric Kaplan and Steve Holland, and turned into a teleplay by Steven Molaro, Jim Reynolds, and Maria Ferrari. Mark Cendrowski directed the episode.
The series depicts a group of male friends employed at the California Institute of Technology, and their relationships with others. In this episode, Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki) runs a Christmas-themed Dungeons & Dragons game for his friends. Meanwhile, Penny (Kaley Cuoco) and the girls take Raj (Kunal Nayyar) to a club.
"The Santa Simulation" received mostly positive reviews from television critics, with comparisons being made to other shows such as Arrested Development and Community due to the relationships and the Dungeons & Dragons game. The episode was viewed by 16.77 million viewers and received a 5.4/17 percent rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, ranking first in its timeslot. The Big Bang Theory was also ranked as the highest-rated program of the night.
Plot
Leonard, Sheldon (Jim Parsons) and Howard (Simon Helberg) each inform their significant others that they will play Dungeons & Dragons and that the girls are banned from participating, while Raj invites Stuart (Kevin Sussman). The game begins at Leonard and Sheldon's apartment, with Leonard as the dungeon master, who reveals the game has a Christmas theme by giving Sheldon a scroll in a Christmas stocking and telling them that their characters have to save Santa Claus from hungry ogres. Sheldon is not happy, and the game begins with Raj's character dying in the first room of the dungeon. The girls enter the apartment wearing sexy dresses (with the exception of Amy (Mayim Bialik), who has a dress Penny describes as from "Forever 63") and do a runway show for the boys in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade their men to go with them to the bar. Only Raj wishes to go as his character is already dead. After initially refusing, they allow him to do so.
When the girls and Raj arrive at the club, they decide to find a girl for Raj, who initially says that he requires someone physically attractive before admitting that he would take anyone. Raj returns to the girls' table with a girl's email address, but it is fake. Disappointed, he complains that he cannot find anyone and laments about how he used to fancy both Penny and Bernadette (Melissa Rauch). Amy suggests that he at some point had found her attractive, to which he responds that he never has, despite encouragement from both Penny and Bernadette to agree. When he realizes how much that hurts Amy, Raj apologizes to her. Amy and Raj connect over their failed love lives, and Raj suggests that he would like to find someone like her. Satisfied, she leaves the club with the others in tow. Raj laments to Penny that he now finds the unavailable Amy attractive.
Meanwhile, in the game, a trap requires the singing of the carol "Good King Wenceslas" to prevent all the characters from being crushed to death. Although only the first verse is needed, Sheldon sings the entire song. A later puzzle results in the boys playing "Jingle Bells" on handbells, in order to lower a drawbridge. Their characters find Santa and are about to release him when Sheldon double crosses the group, paralyzing the other characters and throwing away the only key to Santa's shackles, leaving him in the dungeon to be eaten by ogres. Sheldon then explains that his maternal grandfather, Pop-Pop, was the only member of his family who supported his scientific pursuits. Pop-Pop died when Sheldon was five and Sheldon asked Santa, that Christmas at a mall, to bring Pop-Pop back, but instead received a set of Lincoln Logs; this traumatized him from celebrating Christmas ever since.
In the tag scene, Santa (Dakin Matthews) visits Sheldon in his apartment and apologizes to him for being unable to revive Pop-Pop, but then surprises him by firing a cannon at him in revenge for being left to be eaten by ogres. Sheldon wakes up from his nightmare.
Production
"The Santa Simulation" marks the second appearance of Dungeons & Dragons in a Big Bang Theory plot. It previously appeared in season 5's "The Wiggly Finger Catalyst".
Broadcast and reception
Ratings
"The Santa Simulation" originally aired on CBS on December 13, 2012. The episode was viewed by 16.77 million viewers and received a 5.4/17% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. It was top in its timeslot, ahead of the Fox Network's reality television singing competition The X Factor which received a 2.4/7 percent rating and an episode of the ABC drama series Last Resort, which received a 1.0/3 percent rating. The Big Bang Theory was also the highest rated television show of the night.
Reviews
The A.V. Club reviewer Oliver Sara thought that the episode made Sheldon more sympathetic, while changing the dynamic between Raj and Stuart to something similar to Tobias Fünke and Michael Bluth from Arrested Development. He hoped that the writers would commit to answering the question finally on whether or not Raj is homosexual, and gave the episode an overall grade of "B". IGN writer Jesse Schedeen enjoyed both halves of the episode, but felt that the girls' bar scenes needed more time. While he compared the use of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons in the episode to "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" that of the series Community, he said the "results were characteristically brilliant", but that the "D&D adventure was more of a loose framing device in this case". He compared Sheldon's breakdown in the episode to that of Pierce Hawthorne in the Community episode, and thought that Sheldon's family revelation was dealt with in a silly manner rather than something "overly depressing". He also enjoyed the beginnings of a new bond between Raj and Amy. He summarised the episode by saying "Season 6 has generally been underwhelming after a fairly strong start. This was the first episode in a while that I genuinely enjoyed without any real reservations."
Carla Day of TV Fanatic doubted she would have enjoyed the episode more if she was a Dungeons & Dragons player. She was left disappointed by the girl's bar scenes, and thought the "only entertaining moment was when Raj and Amy bonded over their youthful woes with the opposite sex". She thought the boy's side of the episode fell flat, with the exception of Sheldon singing and the bell scene. ScreenCrave's Candace Butler enjoyed the manner in which Leonard had tailored the experience, saying "we like how his desire to save Santa mimics our desire to retain holiday traditions of caroling, presents or a holiday-themed mocha at Starbucks". She gave the episode an overall score of 9/10, and said, "The Santa Simulation" was a thought-provoking and humorous Christmas-themed episode. Big Bang Theory did not disappoint when exploring Christmastime, gender roles and innuendo." Maane Khatchatourian for Entertainment Weekly thought that it wasn't as good a Christmas episode as season 2's "The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis", but that "it was hilarious and heartfelt, nonetheless". They were pleased with Raj getting more attention in the episode, but also felt that the two sides of the episode reaffirmed the stereotypes of the characters.

Countries and territories in South Asia have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The first South Asian country to report a confirmed case was Nepal, which documented its first case on 23 January 2020, in a man who had returned from Wuhan on 9 January. As of 2 July, at least one case of COVID-19 has been reported in every country in South Asia. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Maldives have implemented lockdowns, Sri Lanka has responded with quarantine curfews while India and Nepal have declared a country-wide lockdown. Countries have also instituted various levels of restrictions on international travel, some countries have completely sealed off their land borders and grounded most international flights.
India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh were three South Asian countries that overtook China in terms of the number of coronavirus cases. In the middle of May, India was the first South Asian country to overtake China in terms of the number of coronavirus cases. On 4 June, Pakistan was the second South Asian country. And on 13 June, Bangladesh was the third South Asian country.
In India, the number of recoveries exceeded the number of active cases on 10 June. In Pakistan, the number of recoveries exceeded the number of active cases on 3 July. And in Bangladesh, the number of recoveries exceeded the number of active cases on 12 July.
Governments are attempting to coordinate a response to the pandemic through the regional organization, SAARC, the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation. India Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed a joint emergency fund to tackle the pandemic, and pledged to seed US$10 Million. As of 11 April, Sri Lanka had contributed US$5 million to the SAARC COVID-19 Emergency Fund and Pakistan $3 million, Bangladesh $1.5 million, Afghanistan and Nepal had given $1 million each, Maldives had given $200,000 while Bhutan $100,000.
Background
The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019 and recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. , more than 708,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in over 190 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 33,500 deaths. More than 150,000 people have since recovered.
The virus primarily spreads between people in a way similar to influenza, via respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing.
The time between exposure and symptom onset is typically five days, but may range from two to fourteen days. Symptoms are most often fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment, but research is ongoing. Efforts are aimed at managing symptoms and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include handwashing, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people (particularly those who are unwell), and monitoring and self-isolation for fourteen days for people who suspect they are infected.
South Asia is one of the most densely populated regions and having low testing rates, and is considered highly vulnerable to any large scale outbreak of an infectious disease.

Regional response
15 March conference call
On 13 March, India Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for a joint regional response to the pandemic through the regional organisation, SAARC; the proposal was met with positive response. A conference call was attended by heads of governments of all member states, except Pakistan which sent the special adviser to the Prime Minister, on 15 March. Modi's proposal to setup an emergency fund was agreed upon. Modi also proposed creating a common research platform to coordinate research within the South Asia region, while Afghan President Ashraf Ghani proposed creating a common framework for telemedicine.
SAARC COVID-19 Emergency Fund
On 15 March 2020, coinciding with the International Consumer Rights Day the emergency fund was proposed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a video conference of SAARC heads of government from New Delhi as a result of the global coronavirus pandemic. The purpose of this fund is to tackle and mitigate the risks associated with the coronavirus pandemic in the South Asian region. Other member nations welcomed the decision of Modi for the proposal of coronavirus emergency fund.

A video conference was held among health professional of all countries at the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) level on 26 March, to discuss a framework for cooperation as agreed in the 15 March conference. A shared electronic platform for sharing of information, knowledge and expertise was proposed.
Censorship
People in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka have been arrested for allegedly spreading false information about the COVID-19 pandemic.
Impact of mobility reduction on air quality
In light of the Google COVID-19 community mobility reports, apparently Afghanistan has a base decrease of mobility and a lower mobility in residential from the base. As far as indoor activity, rate versatility expanded in all nations at a comparable level aside from Afghanistan. Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka had a higher decrease in outdoor, open air versatility. Notwithstanding, for Bangladesh and Pakistan, mobility in the parks didn't lessen that much (around 10-25%) contrasted with other SAARC nations aside from Afghanistan. Likewise, in all classes, Sri Lanka has a reliably higher decrease in portability.
The impact of mobility decrease was likewise seen noticeable in air-quality record (in view of particulate issue size 2.5 micrometers, otherwise called AQI PM2.5). Aside from the Bhutan and Maldives, all nations in SAARC have day by day records of PM2.5 (as announced in airnow.gov) which has been imagined in figure 4 from mid 2020 until May 10 for all urban areas for which the information is accessible in SAARC. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka indicated an expansion of AQI PM2.5 esteem in mid 2020 that crested in mid February, and afterward reliably declined until May. In every single other nation, a consistent diminishing has been seen in these five months. Since a huge extent of PM2.5 can be credited to traffic vehicle's gas and mechanical consuming of fills, this overall decrease of AQI information by implication shows an impact of lockdown in these nations.

IUCN has assessed this bird as vulnerable with its population being estimated at 10,000 to 19,999 mature individuals. Forest loss, due to legal and illegal logging, mining and conversion into farmland and urban development, is its main threat.
The whole of Palawan was designated as a Biosphere Reserve; however, protection and enforcement of laws has been difficult and these threats still continue. It occurs in just one protected area in Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park.
Conservation actions proposed include surveys of remaining lowland forest to understand its true distribution and population status and to propose key sites as protected areas; to assess its ecological requirements, particularly its sensitivity to habitat modification; to support the extension of Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park; and to formally protect the forests of Iwahig Prison and Penal Farm.

"For My Broken Heart" is a song written by Keith Palmer and Liz Hengber, and recorded by American country music singer Reba McEntire. It was released in September 1991 as the first single and title track from her album For My Broken Heart. The song was a Number One hit for her, topping the country singles charts in both the U.S. and Canada.
Content
"For My Broken Heart" chronicles a failed relationship. In the first verse, the male is packing up his belongings and then leaving. After falling asleep on the couch, she reluctantly wakes up and, despite being "so sure life wouldn't go on" without him, she says "I guess the world didn't stop for my broken heart." The song's radio edit omits a string section prelude, the radio edit is included on her Greatest Hits Volume Two compilation albums, but the full album version including the prelude is included on her Reba 1's and her 50 Greatest Hits compilation albums.
McEntire originally planned to record the song as a duet with Clint Black, but he was unavailable at the time.
Music video
The song's music video was directed by Jack Cole and shows four women dealing with heartbreak during a rainy night. Three of them are: a young, white woman sitting at a corner booth at a cafe, a middle-aged black woman in her apartment, and an elderly, white woman, also in her apartment. The fourth woman is Reba herself, clad in a blue nightgown. Reba sings the song while the other three women lip sync along with her. The video ends the next morning, with each of the women over their heartbreak and going about their lives.
The video does not include the string section prelude at the beginning of the song.
Chart positions
"For My Broken Heart" debuted at number 64 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts dated for October 12, 1991. It peaked at number 1 on the chart dated for December 7, 1991 and held the position for two weeks. The song was also a Number One country hit in Canada, holding that position on the RPM Country Tracks chart dated for December 21.

Fernando Castro Palao (b. at León in 1581; d. at Medina, 1 December 1633) was a Spanish Jesuit theologian.
Life
At the age of fifteen, in 1596, he entered the Society of Jesus. He taught philosophy at Valladolid, moral theology at Compostela, and scholastic theology at Salamanca.
Later he became rector of the College of Medina, and consultor and qualificator of the Holy Inquisition. He filled these three offices until his death.
Theologian
He excelled as a moral theologian; his classes of moral theology were attended by a greater number of students than were ever known to follow the course at Compostella. His decisions were regarded as oracles, and difficult cases were submitted to him for solution. Alphonsus Liguori numbers him among the principal authorities on moral theology (Dissert. schol. mor., Naples, 1755, c. iv, n. 119) and Jean-Pierre Gury calls him "a probabilist, a most learned, wise, erudite, and prolific author."
Works
His "Opus Morale" comprises seven volumes, and covers in the same number of treatises, the whole field of moral theology. It appeared first at Lyon, 1631–51; its fifth edition is dated 1700. A general index to the whole work is found in the fourth volume of this last edition, and also in the third edition, which appeared at Venice in 1721.
Immediately after his death (1633) there appeared at Valladolid a meditation book written by him, entitled, "Manual del Cristiano de varias consideraciones para el exercico santa de la oracion." The first part of this work contains meditations on the end of man; the second treats of the life of Christ and his Blessed Mother; the third considers God Himself and in his relations to us.
An English translation of a letter of Castro Palao on the death of Thomas White appeared in The Month for 1890 (vol. 69, pp. 91–93).

Early life and high school
In eighth grade Marrow caught the attention of Hampton coach Edward Joyner at a basketball camp, and Joyner offered him a scholarship on the spot. In his youth Marrow befriended Allen Iverson, whom he considers like a big brother and the greatest player of all time. Marrow played for Heritage High School in Newport News, Virginia as a freshman and sophomore, then transferred to New Hope Christian Academy in Thomasville, North Carolina before his junior season. He returned to Heritage as a senior and was their top scorer, averaging 31 points per game. In January 2016, Marrow committed to Hampton.
College career
Marrow made an instant impact at Hampton as a freshman, averaging 15.6 points, 3.0 assists, and 3.2 rebounds per game but struggled with turnovers.

As a junior, Marrow averaged 24.4 points, 4.9 assists, and 4.1 rebounds per game, shooting 37 percent from behind the arc. He was named to the First Team All-Big South. Following the season, he declared for the 2019 NBA draft but later withdrew his name. In August 2019, he announced he was entering the transfer portal. However, Marrow later announced he was staying at Hampton. As a senior, Marrow surpassed Rick Mahorn as Hampton's all-time leading scorer during a win over UNC Asheville. Marrow scored 18 points as Hampton lost to Winthrop in the Big South championship game 75-68. He finished his career with 2,680 points, the 27th highest in Division I history. He averaged 24.8 points and 6.5 assists per game as a senior and became the first two-time national Player of the Year as selected by BoxToRow, covering historically black colleges in NCAA Division I. He was named to the First Team All-Big South and finished second to Carlik Jones in conference Player of the Year voting.

The flora of Romania comprises around 3,450 species of vascular plants, which represents around 30% of the vascular flora of Europe.
The three major vegetation zones in Romania are the alpine, steppe, and forest zones. The latter can be subdivided (depending on soil, climate, and altitude) into regions dominated by the Norway Spruce, European Beech, and various species of Oak, together with less widespread vegetation types such as the Dinaric calcareous block fir forest.
The Danube Delta is the largest continuous marshland in Europe. Vegetation in the marshland is dominated by reeds, with Willow, Poplar, Alder, and Oak on the higher ground. In 1991, this area became part of the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. The delta supports 1,688 different plant species.
The meadow-steppe grassland areas of Romania are also species-rich, but endangered.
Among the flora of Romania are medicinal plants such as Arnica montana, Primula veris, Tussilago farfara, and Atropa belladonna.
All the genera and species of plants found in Romania are listed in the 1977 work The Flora of Romania Illustrated Determinator of Vascular Plants.

Richard "Dick" Cresson Harlow (October 19, 1889 – February 19, 1962) was an American football player and coach, as well as an oologist. Harlow served as the head coach at Pennsylvania State University (1915–1917), Colgate University (1922–1925), Western Maryland College (1926–1934), and Harvard University (1935–1942, 1945–1947). He is credited with pioneering modern defensive schemes. Often fielding undersized teams, Harlow coordinated stunts to avoid blockers, rather than trying to overpower them. His offensive style utilized shifts, reverses, and lateral passes. Harlow was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1954.
Early years
A native of Philadelphia, Harlow attended Pennsylvania State University, where he played football for the Nittany Lions, under Bill and Jack Hollenback. As a tackle, Harlow distinguished himself during the 1910 and 1911 seasons. In the latter year, the team went undefeated and won the national title. A two-year letterman, he also was a member of the baseball and track and field teams, as well as the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity.
Coaching career
Penn State
Upon graduation from Penn State, Harlow remained with the Nittany Lions as an assistant football coach for three seasons, under his former coach Bill Hollenback. Harlow succeeded him as head coach in 1915, and hired Lawrence Whitney as an assistant. After compiling a combined 20–8 record in three seasons, Harlow entered the United States Army in 1918, and was stationed at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, where he was an assistant coach for Charles A. Bernier. After an honorable discharge, Harlow returned to Penn State in the following year, again as an assistant, but this time under coach Hugo Bezdek. Harlow also became the boxing coach at that time.
Colgate
Harlow left Penn State to become the 20th head coach at Colgate University from 1922 to 1925, succeeding Ellery Huntington Jr. For the first two seasons, Harlow hired Punk Berryman as assistant. Harlow coached the team to a 55–0 victory over Niagara University, where players refused to tackle any Colgate players, leading to many scores. Harlow's overall coaching record at Colgate was 24–9–3.
Western Maryland
Harlow moved from Colgate to become the head coach at Western Maryland College from 1926 to 1934, succeeding Ken Shroyer. There, Harlow coached the Green Terror to a 60–13–7 record with three undefeated seasons. In 1934 Western Maryland was invited to play in the inguinal Orange Bowl. Seeing it as not much of a challenge; Harlow declined to have his players play in then more prestigious East–West Shrine Game. In Orange Bowl, Bucknell, who lost to the Green Terror early that season, beat the Miami Hurricanes.
Harlow had many great players such as Eugene "Stoney" Willis, who threw the first shovel pass against Boston College in 1932, and Bill Shepherd, who was considered to be one of the best running backs in the country in the early 1930s, starring the East West shrine game in 1934 behind Michigan center Gerald Ford. At Western Maryland, Harlow also coached Rip Engle. He had a great influence on Engle's career, and they remained good friends for many years. Harlow said that his "biggest thrill" came from those games where he beat Bosten College and Bucknell by such a lopsided margin.
Harvard
In 1935, Harlow became the first non-alumnus ever to coach at Harvard. The job was initially offered to Clark Shaughnessy, but was turned down. Harlow's assistant coaches immediately became Henry Lamar and Skip Stahley. Lamar took over as head coach while Harlow served in the United States Navy during World War II. When Harlow returned, Lamar went back to being an assistant. From 1938 to 1946, Lyal Clark also served as an assistant. At Harvard, Harlow was voted Coach of the Year in 1936, and a year later, was chosen as the Ivy League Coach of the Year. He retired in 1947 with a lifetime record of 149–69–17, and was succeeded by Arthur Valpey. Harlow was named to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1954.
Oology career
Harlow was an expert in oology, the study of birds' eggs. In 1939, he was named curator of oology at the Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology, and he remained in that position until 1954.

Reviews
As Ninos Mikelides wrote: "Mazomenos records the route of his tragic hero through images selected with thought, images artistically wonderful, with lightings that clearly present the psychological state of the persons. The route of the Afghan immigrant gives the director the opportunity to present us cared and inspired pictures of the sad life of immigrants in our country, to conclude with the amazing, shocking images in the finale. Mazomenos managed with that to give us a strong film".

A Counterfeit Silence : Selected Poems (1969) is a poetry collection by Australian poet and novelist Randolph Stow. It won the Grace Leven Prize for Poetry in 1969.
The collection consists of 65 poems, most of which were published in various Australian poetry publications.
Contents
Critical reception
Geoff Page, reviewing the collection in The Canberra Times, found a unique voice: "Randolph Stow is one of the few younger Australian poets who have found truly individual voices. It is a voice which will not please everyone for it can be high-pitched and contorted but it is unique, and that, these days, is a distinct achievement."
While reviewing the book as a part of a survey of Australian poetry of the time, Ronald Dunlop noted: "Here, landscape slips into place. Randolph Stow's poetry, strongly rooted in the earth, reaches out from it to the other world of humanity. Essentially the poetry of experience, its promise is great, its performance so far impressive."
Notes
Epigraph: "Even speech was for them a debased form of silence; how much more futile is poetry, which is a debased form of speech." Thornton Wilder: The Bridge of San Luis Rey
Dedication: To Jock Curle

Cairns v Visteon UK Ltd (2006) is a United Kingdom labour law case, regarding the scope of protection available to agency workers.*
Facts
An assistant manager of 7 years with Visteon UK Ltd, Ms Cairns became an agency worker for the four most recent years through an agency named ‘MSX'. She was dismissed for allegedly falsifying her time sheets. The agency did investigations and cleared her, but Ms Cairns was not allowed back to work. The agency gave her pay in lieu of notice and redundancy. But she wanted compensation for unfair dismissal and brought a claim to the tribunal.
Judgment
Judge Peter Clark held that Ms Cairns was not an "employee" under ERA 1996 s 230, and therefore could not bring an unfair dismissal claim. Doubting dicta in Dacas v Brook Street Bureau (UK) Ltd by Sedley LJ he insisted there was different policy behind ERA 1996 Part 10 to that of tort law, and there was "no good policy reason for extending that protection to a second parallel employer."

Kevin William Walsh AO (13 July 1925 – 4 December 2017) was an Australian pioneer of the profession of clinical neuropsychology.
Career
Walsh served with in the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II, then commenced medical studies in 1946. In the first year of his medical training, he became interested in psychology and enrolled in the University of Melbourne's newly established Department of Psychology.
After completing his medical studies, Walsh became interested in abnormal behaviour, and during his tenure as a Neuropsychiatric Medical Officer at the Mont Park Mental Hospital, he studied the complex behavioural alterations induced by prefrontal leucotomy, for which the degree of Master of Science was awarded in 1960. Working as a medical officer, he saw a clinical discipline that would unite psychological depth with neurology.
In 1961, Walsh joined the teaching staff of the University of Melbourne's Department of Psychology, initially in an honorary position. Walsh taught a syndrome-oriented approach to neuropsychology, informed by an understanding of neuroanatomy, neurological and neuropsychological syndromes and psychometrics. He taught his students to listen to and observe the patient, talk to the family and to think logically, describing neuropsychology as 'a body-contact sport.' Walsh collaborated with his friend Peter Bladin, director of neurology at the Austin Hospital, Melbourne, to establish a postgraduate training program in Clinical Neuropsychology at the university and a Clinical Neuropsychology Unit at the hospital. The first student intake was in 1977. Walsh retired from teaching in 1991.
One of his most influential works was Neuropsychology: A Clinical Approach, first published in 1978, intending it to be an introduction to the field. The book was published with David Darby in 1999, then published as Walsh's Neuropsychology in 2005, and was translated into a number of languages.
Conference and organisation
In 1977, Walsh and Gordon Stanley founded the Australian Society for the Study of Brain Impairment (ASSBI), with Walsh as the inaugural president. The organisation has focused on giving aspiring neuropsychologists an environment to meet their peers and more experienced clinicians and researchers.
Walsh, Bladin and Stanley hosted a conference called the Brain Impairment Workshop at the Austin Hospital in Melbourne in 1976, where the ASSBI organisational name and logo were chosen and it became the annual conference of the organisation. At the 1978 conference, Walsh gave the opening address entitled ‘The Nature of Modern Neuropsychology' in which he spoke about the studies of neurologists Hans-Lukas Teuber, Brenda Milner and Alexander Luria, who looked at missile wounds from World War II and applied the concept of the neuropsychological syndrome. This was in contrast to the single construct of organic brain damage being advocated by clinical psychologists in the United States of the time. Annual conference proceedings were published until 2000 when the society launched Brain Impairment, a peer-reviewed scientific journal.
Awards
Walsh was honoured with the Order of Australia in the 1991 Australia Day Honours for service to neuropsychology.
In 1995, the International Neuropsychological Society (INS) awarded Walsh with an Honorary Membership in recognition of his contribution to Neuropsychology and in 2013 was awarded a Distinguished career Award.

Ibrahim Hani Bisharat (; born February 22, 1984 in Amman) is a Jordanian equestrian rider. He is a three-time Olympian and is currently ranked no. 285 in the world by Fédération Équestre Internationale (FEI).
At age twenty, Bisharat made his official debut for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, where he competed in the individual jumping event, along with his horse Qwinto. He placed fifty-second at the end of qualifying rounds, with a total of forty-two penalties.
At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Bisharat rode his second horse Sam-Sam in the individual jumping event, where he received a total of forty-one penalties in the second qualifying round, and was thereby eliminated from the competition.
At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Bisharat selected his third and current horse Vrieda O to ride and compete for the third time in the individual jumping event. Unlike his two previous games, Bisharat was immediately eliminated at the first stage of the qualifying rounds after knocking down three fences, and incurring time penalties, which placed him in the bottom fifteen places of a seventy-five strong field.
Bisharat is currently coached by Dutch-born Belgian equestrian rider Jos Lansink, a seven-time Olympian and gold medalist for the jumping event at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.

This is a list of The Citadel baseball seasons. The Citadel Bulldogs baseball team represents The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina and is a member of the Southern Conference of the NCAA Division I. The team played its first season in 1899, but complete records were not kept until after the ACC split prior to the 1954 season. Results listed for seasons prior to that are those compiled by the school from historical accounts and represent the most current information The Citadel has. No team was fielded from 1932–34 or from 1941–46. In addition, the 1917 team was disbanded due to the outbreak of World War I.
The Bulldogs are eight time Southern Conference Baseball Tournament champions, thirteen time regular season conference champions, and have participated in postseason play thirteen times through the 2017 season. In 1990, the team won the Atlantic Regional in Miami, FL and advanced to the 1990 College World Series, becoming the first and (as of 2016) only military school to ever play in Omaha.

Gail discovers the friendship one night after Linda comes over to ask Erik about something Dexter ate in the boys' quest to find a natural cure for his disease. She furiously warns Linda to keep Dexter away, but Linda encourages the friendship. When the boys read an article in a tabloid about a doctor in distant New Orleans who claims to have found a cure for AIDS, they set out on their own down the Mississippi River with the hope of finding a means of saving Dexter's life.
The boys take a boat down the river with a bunch of degenerates who don't treat the pair very well. Eventually the boys steal their money and try to hitchhike the rest of the way. When the boatmen find out their money has been stolen, they locate the kids at a bus station and proceed to chase them until they reach a dead end of a dilapidated building. Erik draws a switchblade and one of the men draws a knife. Dexter suddenly grabs the knife from Erik and cuts his own hand. He threatens the boatman with his blood, saying that he has AIDS and could easily transfer the disease to him through the man's open wounds. This scares the men off. Dexter then realizes what he has done by directly exposing his blood to the outside environment. He suddenly feels sick, so Erik escorts him back to the bus station. Realizing that their journey must end if Dexter is to be treated, Erik resorts to calling Linda to have her pick the boys up when they reach Stillwater by bus.
Once they return, Dexter spends the rest of his time in the hospital. As his relationship with his mother has grown increasingly strained, Erik goes to stay with Linda who lets him visit Dexter. The boys joke and prank the doctors three times that Dexter has died, but when a third doctor arrives to check on him, Dexter has died for real. While driving Erik home, Linda notices a mother holding her young child while crossing the street. Reminded of her own son, she pulls over and breaks down crying. Erik apologizes to her, saying that he should have tried harder to find a cure. Linda, taken aback by his comment, embraces Erik, explaining that he was the happiest thing in Dexter's difficult life. Upon their arrival at home, a furious Gail confronts the pair. When Gail starts to hit Erik, Linda quickly intervenes, angrily and tearfully informs her of Dexter's death, and demands that she allow Erik to attend the funeral and never hit him again and threatens to report her to child protective services. Gail guiltily complies.
At Dexter's funeral, Erik places one of his shoes in the coffin and takes one of Dexter's to let sail down the river. This pays homage to an earlier moment in their trip when Dexter, who was having nightmares, was given one of Erik's sneakers to hold as a reminder that he's always by his side.

Production
Development
The script for the film was written in 1993 by Robert Kuhn. Although studio executives were initially skittish about the film's commercial prospects due to its subject matter, the script became a hot property when Steven Spielberg's production company Amblin Entertainment showed interest in buying it. A resulting bidding war ended with a million-dollar sale to Eric Eisner of Island Pictures.
Eisner sought out Martin Brest to direct the film, but Brest declined as he was unsure he could get the necessary performances out of young actors. Other directors who declined were Sydney Pollack, Rob Reiner and Paul Brickman. Universal Pictures, who had signed on to distribute the film, expressed concern that no director had yet come on board, so Eisner halved the film's initial $20 million budget and hired Peter Horton to direct.
While the script circulated through talent agencies for the casting process, some industry figures criticized the script's irresponsibility in its treatment of homosexuality and accused it of homophobia. Particular criticism was directed towards scenes in which neighborhood bullies insult Dexter, calling him gay slurs while no other characters attempt to neutralize the insults. Horton attempted to address this problem through the character of Jerry, a gay male nurse played by actor Peter Moore. Commenting on Jerry's character, journalist Jess Cagle opined, "Jerry's homosexuality is apparent only in a slight part of Moore's performance. The result is an effeminate character who is at best secretly gay, at worst an offensive stereotype."
Casting
Horton hoped to cast big stars to boost the film's box office returns and asked his ex-wife Michelle Pfeiffer and actress Meg Ryan to participate, both of whom declined. Horton was hesitant to work with children as he doubted the ability of young actors to express the emotional weight needed for the film, but was blown away by the auditions of both Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro. Mazzello had not met anyone with AIDS before, so Horton suggested he watch an HBO special about an Australian boy who died of the disease.
Filming
The film was shot over the summer of 1994 in Stillwater, Minnesota. Locations included the St. Croix River and Minnehaha Creek.
Soundtrack
The original soundtrack to the film was composed by Dave Grusin and released by GRP Records on May 9, 1995.
Tommy Morgan contributed to the musical harmony and Michael Fisher worked with percussion. The instruments used in the martial band of the track are: piano, electric bass, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, synthesizer, and alto flute. The song called "My Great Escape" was written and performed by Marc Cohn. However, this song has never been released in any medium outside of the film.
In a review for AllMusic, Jason Ankeny commented, "The music's gentle strings and playful woodwinds sweetly capture the innocence of childhood without trafficking in schmaltz...More important, he treats the film's subject matter...with admirable restraint, eschewing heart-tugging treacle in favor of light, organic melodies that celebrate life instead of mourning its loss."
Reception
Box office
The Cure debuted in the number 13 spot in North American theaters and grossed $1.2 million during its opening weekend. Across 832 theaters in the US and Canada, the film's grosses totaled to $2,568,425. It performed better in Japan, grossing more than $4.5 million in its first three weeks of release with $1.73 million on opening weekend across 33 theatres.
Critical response
The Cure has an approval rating of 45% based on 11 critics' reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.
The performances of Renfro, Mazzello, and Sciorra were roundly praised. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review, stating "Mazzello is naturally captivating and Renfro especially, is a remarkably instinctive young actor...What makes us cry is not that Dexter has AIDS, but that Dexter and Erik have each other to the end, until death separates them. It is an odd feat to create a dramatic story that brings us to tears even without worrying about AIDS. 'The Cure' achieved this miracle." Peter Stack of The San Francisco Chronicle said Renfro and Mazzello's "performances are so warm and richly layered...in a loving, funny and wistful film that plays like a slightly torn Norman Rockwell illustration."
Kevin Thomas from the Los Angeles Times wrote, "[The film] works as a drama on friendship and its challenges" and commended Horton in drawing measured performances from his actors. Stephen Holden of The New York Times stated "it evokes with an intense clarity the particular blend of innocence, curiosity, terror and bravado that drives children to commit desperate acts."
Among the criticisms were that the film was predictable, implausible and manipulative. Thomas noted, "All told, 'The Cure' plays more like a movie made for TV than the big screen." Leonard Klady of Variety stated, "Director Peter Horton is more assured with his artists, particularly the central youngsters. The strength he brings to the material is in the development of their relationship," but lamented that "wholly preposterous plot turns take over, and [the] pic never recovers once the two boys decide to paddle down the Mississippi a la Huck Finn."
Another criticism was towards the film's softening of the physical ravages of AIDS, "[reducing] the symptoms to weakness, occasional fever and a few mild coughing fits." Schwarzbaum wrote, "A dying child is emotional blackmail; a child dying of AIDS is an emotional bludgeon, and a filmmaker would do well to keep the case very, very specific, rather than make the deterioration a poetic mystery."
Joey O'Bryan of The Austin Chronicle said, "There are some good, effective moments in The Cure, but far too often the film lapses into silly heart-tugging...[ultimately] the movie's good intentions are rarely realized, and the nice message of this family film (Kids with AIDS are people too!) is unfortunately delivered with a slight whiff of homophobia. Then subtract another half a star for the absurdly in-your-face Butterfinger product placement, and what you've got left is a competently acted, high concept, family entertainment, coming of age, AIDS tearjerker that occasionally doubles as a candy bar commercial."
Accolades
Home media
The Cure was released in DVD on November 23, 2004 and also in Blu-ray on March 23, 2021 in Japan.
The film will be released on Blu-ray in the United States via Mill Creek Entertainment, under their "Retro VHS Collection", on October 4, 2022.

Ferndale is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It forms part of the Detroit metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 19,190.
Ferndale is well known in the Detroit area for its LGBT population and progressive policies.
History
Native Americans were early inhabitants of the area now known as the City of Ferndale. In the 1800s farmers began cultivating the land. After the invention of the automobile and the development of the automotive assembly line, the population of Ferndale increased rapidly.
Ferndale was incorporated into a village in 1918. It was then incorporated into a city on March 7, 1927, by vote of the citizens of the village. It became a bedroom community for Detroit workers, with most of its growth in housing from 1920 to 1951. Through the early 1950s there were trolley (interurban railroad) lines in the median strip of Woodward Avenue from downtown Detroit to Pontiac. These helped the northern suburbs of Detroit grow as bedroom communities as people could take the trolley to shop or work in Detroit.
In the 1970s, the Ferndale suburban community emerged as a place for families to raise children during the "Baby Boom" era, with its elementary schools, a downtown, city parks, active churches and civic groups. Ferndale High was completed in 1958.
Ferndale's downtown shopping area, 9 Mile Road, featured many busy, popular stores in the 1940s to 1960s, but later went into decline, and many businesses closed. In recent decades, the downtown area has revitalized. Ferndale's downtown is formed by two major thoroughfares, Nine Mile Road and Woodward Avenue. Circa 1997 the city made the downtown more pedestrian-friendly by narrowing West Nine Mile Road, the heart of the downtown, to one lane in each direction and adding on-street parking. The result has been a return of pedestrian traffic and an influx of new stores and restaurants. The city has continued to make itself more accessible to people by reducing traffic lanes on Hilton Road and Pinecrest Road, two major local north/south streets, and adding bicycle lanes.
Government
Ferndale utilizes the council-manager form of government, and is governed by a city council consisting of a mayor and four council members. The city council appoints a city manager, who manages the day-to-day operations of the city. The current mayor of Ferndale is Melanie Piana. Current city council members are Raylon Leaks-May, who is also Mayor Pro Tem, Greg Pawlica, Kat Bruner-James and Laura Mikulski. The current city manager is Joseph Gacioch.

Ferndale is adjacent to the cities of Detroit to the south, Oak Park to the west, Hazel Park to the east, Pleasant Ridge to the north, Royal Oak Township to the southwest, and Royal Oak to the north.
Ferndale is bordered to the south by 8 Mile Road, to the north (west of Woodward Avenue) by Oakridge Street, and (east of Woodward Avenue) by 10 Mile Road and I-696.

The Land Trust of Virginia (LTV) was originally formed in 1991 as the first statewide nonprofit land trust in the Commonwealth of Virginia. LTV uses a legal tool called a conservation easement to help landowners voluntarily protect scenic, historic or environmentally sensitive lands while keeping the land in private ownership and open for compatible uses, including forestry, farming, recreation and limited residential uses.
The Land Trust of Virginia is headquartered near Middleburg, Virginia and has protected more than 151 properties and 16,049 acres (40 km2) throughout the state. The greatest density of easements are in Loudoun and Fauquier Counties, but LTV also holds easements in Clarke, Rappahannock, Culpeper, Madison, Hanover, and Green Counties. In 2009, the Land Trust of Virginia was accredited by the Land Trust Accreditation Commission, an independent program of the national Land Trust Alliance. The Land Trust of Virginia is one of the first 54 land trusts in the nation – and the second in Virginia - to receive such a designation.

MaxiK channels are large conductance, voltage and calcium-sensitive potassium channels which are fundamental to the control of smooth muscle tone and neuronal excitability. MaxiK channels can be formed by 2 subunits: the pore-forming alpha subunit and the modulatory beta subunit. The protein encoded by this gene is an auxiliary beta subunit which slows activation kinetics, leads to steeper calcium sensitivity, and shifts the voltage range of current activation to more negative potentials than does the beta 1 subunit.

An Infinite Summer is the second collection of science fiction short stories by British writer Christopher Priest and the first of his books to collect stories set in the Dream Archipelago. The stories had all previously been published in various anthologies and magazines; they may be described, somewhat interchangeably, as science fiction, fantasy literature, metafiction and macabre.
Stories
"An Infinite Summer" (1976)
"Whores" (1978)
"Palely Loitering" (1979)
"The Negation" (1978)
"The Watched" (1978)
The material in the collection may be divided into two types: the first, namely "An Infinite Summer" and "Palely Loitering" are more straightforward works of science fiction involving time travel, while the other three are early parts of Priest's "Dream Archipelago" sequence, described by John Clute as "intensify[ing] the sense that Priest's landscapes had now become forms of expression of the psyche, and are of intense interest for the dream-like convolutions of psychic terrain so displayed." Priest would later revisit the setting at length in novels such as The Affirmation and, in 1999, these early stories would be revised and reassembled with other material as The Dream Archipelago.
"An Infinite Summer" was originally published in the anthology Andromeda 1 (1976, ed. Peter Weston, ). A time travel story, it was reprinted in later anthologies, such as Trips in Time (1977, ed. Robert Silverberg, ), and in translation. It was selected for The Best Science Fiction of the Year 6 by editor Terry Carr. Priest says that he interrupted the writing of his 1976 novel The Space Machine ("somewhere in Chapter 13, to be precise"), and chose to publish the story separately "because there was one strong feeling that would not fit in the novel: the sense that layers of time exist, that places do not change so much as people."
In August, 1940, protagonist Thomas Lloyd daily visits the Thames Bridge in Richmond, London, England. He spots "freezers" around the park; freezers is his term for people from an unknown future who, for unknown reasons, will occasionally use a device to freeze people out of time. These frozen people remain visible only to the freezers and to others, like Thomas, who were once frozen. In June, 1903, Thomas was frozen at the very moment of proposing to a lovely young lady, Sarah, who accepted him. Thomas remained frozen in this tableau until 1935, after which he finds that the frozen are considered, by their contemporaries, to have vanished. He is now disinherited and poor; he learns that freezing may "erode" after minutes or years; and he finds what work he can in the vicinity so that he may visit Sarah, in her radiant immobility, every day. "Thomas Lloyd, of neither the past nor the present, saw himself as a product of both, and as a victim of the future." After long, patient waiting, he sees Sarah unfreeze during The Blitz. The freezers have watched Thomas; when Sarah awakes, blissful but baffled by the bombing, they restore their tableau, presumably so that the lovers will wake again in a kinder future. If so, this is one of Priest's happier endings.
"Whores" was written immediately prior to his novel A Dream of Wessex. It was originally published in the anthology New Dimensions: Science Fiction: 8 (1978, ed. Robert Silverberg, ). It was reprinted in later anthologies and in translation. It was selected for Best Science Fiction Stories of the Year: Eighth Annual Collection (1979) by Gardner Dozois.
"Whores" is a nightmare from the vagina dentata school of folk tales. It is narrated by a soldier, recovering from a blast of "the enemy's synaesthetic gas", who is sent to the Archipelago island of Winho to convalesce. There he hopes to find a young prostitute whom he had loved, Slenje, but she is dead. He is seduced by Elva, who has been "experimented upon" when Winho was occupied by enemy troops. According to her, their enemies are the real whores, not prostitutes like herself. He enjoys the sex, but several incidents disturb him beyond his momentary flashes of synesthesia: Elva's legs are bizarrely scarred, her teeth have been filed into points; when her year-old boy in the next room cries because he has hurt his hand, Elva soothes him by sucking his little hand into her mouth; while Elva pleasures the soldier, he "visualized her as some monstrous animal, chewing into my gut. It was the most hideous image of woman." The next day, boarding a ferry, the soldier realizes that Elva had teased his torso with her teeth; these are now becoming open wounds. When he reaches into his pocket to pay the ferryman, a tiny child's hand, severed at the wrist, seizes his fingers and will not let go. In his Introduction, Priest writes that he wrote the story at Christmas. "There the resemblance to good cheer ends, as you will discover, and in retrospect think I must have eaten too much plum duff."
"Palely Loitering" was originally published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in the January 1979 issue; Priest reaped the cover illustration by Ron Walotsky. Anthologist Terry Carr selected the story for The Best Science Fiction Novellas of the Year #2 (1980; ), and Mike Ashley chose it likewise for The Mammoth Book of Time Travel SF (2013; ). The story has been translated several times.
The title is harvested from the ballad La Belle Dame sans Merci by John Keats; the relevant lines run:
1 O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,2 Alone and palely loitering?. . .41 I saw their starved lips in the gloam,42 With horrid warning gapèd wide,43 And I awoke and found me here,44 On the cold hill's side.45 And this is why I sojourn here,46 Alone and palely loitering...
"Palely Loitering" earned the BSFA Award for Best Short Fiction in 1979. It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novelette in 1980, and was further nominated for the 1980 Locus Award for Best Novella.
Priest remarked of "Palely Loitering" that it "was written soon after I returned from a long and very happy stay in Melbourne, Australia. It was an attempt to think myself back into a European sensibility; visiting Australia is like seeing the past and future simultaneously, and the familiar and unfamiliar at once."
"The Negation" was originally published in Anticipations, a 1978 anthology edited by Priest; it has been collected here in An Infinite Summer and in his The Dream Archipelago (1999). In French translation, it has been anthologized in Le livre d'or de la Science-Fiction: Christopher Priest (1980) and L'Archipel du Rêve (1981). Of his collection An Infinite Summer, Priest wrote, "'The Negation' also fits into the [Dream Archipelago] series, although in a slightly different way."
Dik, an eighteen-year-old policeman, looks eagerly forward to the visit of novelist Moylita Kaine, author of The Affirmation (the title of Priest's own 1981 metafictional novel). From her and from the events surrounding her visit, he learns more about the nature of his world and about the limitations that even novelists may face.
"The Watched" was first published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in the April 1978 issue; it was nominated for the 1979 Hugo Award for Best Novella and the 1979 Locus Award for Best Novella. Anthologist Terry Carr selected the story for The Best Science Fiction Novellas of the Year #1 (1979; ). Priest has said that he wrote "The Watched" immediately after finishing A Dream of Wessex.

The Samoan fantail (Rhipidura nebulosa) is a species of bird in the family Rhipiduridae.
It is endemic to Samoa and is found in Upolu and Savaiʻi islands.
Description
The plumage is mostly dark greyish-brown with white undertail, black tail and light (white or pale smoky) throat. White spot behind the eyes. Like other fantails, Samoan fantail often spreads its long tail like a fan. The usual sounds are a low chirp. Sometimes imitates the voices of other bird species.
Distribution and habitat
The Samoan fantail is described as common and widespread on Upolu Island and has a limited distribution on the island of Savaiʻi.
It's natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. Prefers primary and secondary rainforests, but tolerates man-made landscapes: plantations and gardens.
Taxonomy
According to IOC there are 2 recognised subspecies. In alphabetical order, these are:
R. n. altera Mayr, 1931
R. n. nebulosa Peale, 1849
Samoan fantail (R. nebulosa) forms a superspecies with:

It's About Time is the first CD digital format album release by the California State University, Los Angeles Jazz Ensembles completed in 1990. In addition to two big bands (1989/1990) the CD features the CSULA Jazz Sextet. The jazz bands had numerous student musicians that have made a name for themselves as professionals to include Luis Bonilla, Jack Cooper, Corey Gemme, Alan Parr, Randall Willis, Paul De Castro, Alex Henderson, Sheffer Bruton, Ruben Ramos, and José Arellano.
Background
In 1984 and 1985, the California State University, Los Angeles Music Department and CSULA Associated Students decided to fund LP recordings of the jazz ensemble to better serve as a teaching tool for student music, jazz groups. It's About Times is the fifth of six albums to come from CSULA during the 1980s featuring the award winning CSULA #1 Jazz Ensemble. The CD contains tracks from the #1 CSULA Jazz Ensembles of two successive years and a sextet to include compositions of five students and from the two directors (professors David Caffey and Jeff Benedict).
There has been a consistent tradition of musicians coming from the CSULA program who have worked with major musical acts, on major studio and movie projects, and hold positions in higher education in music. The roster on this album is self-evident as to the diversity and level of student musicians CSULA developed at that time and has for many years dating far back to musicians (graduates) such as Lennie Niehaus and Gabe Baltazar.

The coffee production in Honduras played a role in the country's history and is important for the Honduran economy. In 2011, the country became Central America's top producer of coffee.
History
19th century
The cultivation of the coffee plant was in its infancy in the Republic of Honduras at the end of the 19th century. While there were numerous coffee plantations at the time, they were small. The soil, climate, and conditions in Honduras are the same as those of Guatemala, Nicaragua, or Costa Rica. The drawback in Honduras was lack of means of transportation and facilities for shipment to the coast. There was practically no exportation of coffee from Honduras, the product was mostly sold domestically. A new plantation of coffee would begin to produce a profit by the end of the fourth year after planting, and after the seventh year a profit of from 100 to 300 per cent on the capital invested could be expected. The production of coffee in 1894 was reckoned at 20,000 quintals, of which only 10 per cent was exported. The exportation was from the southern Pacific port of Amapala and the northern, deep water, Caribbean port of Puerto Cortes. In 1900, Honduras exported 54,510 pesos' worth of coffee.

to the south.
Places of interest include the El Vendrell beaches, the town of Roc de San Gaieta, the Roman Arch of Bará, the remains of Tarraco, declared a World Heritage Site and as well as several small towns or places such as Sant Carles de la Ràpita, with one of the best fishing ports in this entire coastal sector. Inlands, the walled town of Montblanc and the Poblet Abbey stand out, where various kings of the Crown of Aragon lie.
Another tourist attraction on the Costa Dorada is the PortAventura World amusement park.
Etymology
Costa Daurada, literally, the Golden Coast, takes its name from the colour of its sand when the sun is shining.

The 11th/28th Battalion, Royal Western Australia Regiment was formed in 1987 by the amalgamation of the 11th and 28th Battalions. These two battalions both trace their history back to units formed for service in the First World War, although they also perpetuate previous units that served during the Second Boer War.
The 11th Battalion was raised at Black Boy Hill Camp on 17 August 1914 as part of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). Attached to the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, it was one of the first units raised in Australia following the outbreak of the war. After training in Egypt, the 11th Battalion landed at Anzac Cove and fought throughout the Gallipoli campaign. After being withdrawn from Gallipoli the battalion served with distinction on the Western Front in France and Belgium until the end of the war. Following the end of hostilities, the 11th returned to Western Australia and was disbanded on 5 February 1919.
In 1921 the decision was made to perpetuate the designations and battle honours of the AIF by reforming these units as part of the Militia. In 1927 territorial titles were adopted and the battalion became the 11th Battalion (City of Perth Regiment). During the economic hardships of the 1930s the battalion was briefly amalgamated with the 16th Battalion, however, in 1936, in response to the reoccupation of the Rhineland by German military forces, the Australian government decided to expand the Militia; as a result, the two units were delinked once again.
At the outbreak of the Second World War, due to the provisions of the Defence Act (1903) which precluded sending the Militia outside of Australian territory to fight, it was decided to raise an all volunteer force for overseas service. This force was known as the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF). The infantry units of the 2nd AIF adopted the same designations as those of the 1st AIF, with the prefix numeral '2' in front to differentiate them from the Militia battalions that continued to exist. As result, during the war there were two battalions to bare the numerals 11th Battalion. The 2/11th Battalion was attached to the 6th Division and served in the Western Sahara, Greece, Crete and the Tobruk, as well as in the Pacific. At the same time, the Militia 11th Battalion (City of Perth Regiment) was attached to the 13th Brigade, 4th Division and spent most of its active service on garrison duties in Australia before taking part in the New Britain campaign in 1944–45.
The 28th Battalion shared a similar history to the 11th, being formed in 1915 as part of the 7th Brigade and fighting in Gallipoli, France and Belgium during the First World War. Following the war, it was re-raised as the 28th Battalion (Swan Regiment) in 1921 and was based in east Perth.
During the Second World War, the 2/28th Battalion served with the 9th Division at Tobruk, El Alamein, New Guinea and Borneo, while the 28th Battalion (Swan Regiment) fought in New Britain alongside the 11th Battalion in 1944–45.
Following the end of the war, these four units were disbanded. In 1948, when Australia's part-time military forces were re-raised as the Citizens Military Force (CMF), the 16th/28th Infantry Battalion was formed. They remained joined until 1952 when the two units were split once again. In 1960, when the Australian Army was reorganised along Pentropic lines, the regional regiments were amalgamated into multi-battalion State-based regiments. As a result, both the 16th and 28th Battalions were reduced to company-level formations within the larger 1st Battalion, Royal Western Australia Regiment, with the 16th providing one company known as 'B' (The Cameron Company), and the 28th providing one company known as 'A' (The Swan Company).
The 11th Battalion was also re-raised in 1948, although it was re-raised as an amalgamated unit known as the 11th/44th Battalion (The City of Perth Regiment). They remained on the order of battle until 1960 when they became a company-level organisation within the Pentropic 1st Battalion, Royal Western Australia Regiment, known as 'A' (The City of Perth Company).
In 1966, following the decision to revert to the tropical establishment and reorganise the CMF, the 28th Battalion was reformed as the 28th Battalion, Royal Western Australia Regiment, and the following year the 11th Battalion was also reformed. In 1977, both units were redesignated as independent rifle companies; however, in 1987 they were amalgamated together to form the current unit known as the 11th/28th Battalion, Royal Western Australia Regiment.

The Constitutional Army (; also known as the Constitutionalist Army) was the army that fought against the Federal Army, and later, against the Villistas and Zapatistas during the Mexican Revolution. It was formed in March 1913 by Venustiano Carranza, so-called "First-Chief" of the army, as a response to the murder of President Francisco I. Madero and Vice President José María Pino Suárez by Victoriano Huerta during La Decena Trágica (Ten Tragic Days) of 1913, and the resulting usurpation of presidential power by Huerta.
Carranza had a few military forces on which he could rely for loyalty. He had the theoretical support of Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata, but they soon turned against the Constitutionalists after Huerta's defeat in 1914.
In July 1913, Carranza divided the country into seven areas for military operations. Each area was, at least in theory, the responsibility of a general commanding an Army corps. These corps were: Northeast, Northwest, Central, East, West, South and Southeast. However the last four existed only on paper and in reality the Constitutionalist army was made up of only the Northwest Corps (renamed the Army of Operations) under Álvaro Obregón, the Northeast Corps under Pablo González, and the Central Corps under Pánfilo Natera.
When fighting broke out in 1914 between the Constitutionalists (Carranza, Obregón, etc.) and the Conventionalists (Villa and Zapata) following the Convention of Aguascalientes, the Constitutional Army numbered 57,000 men, to Villa and Zapata's 72,000 men. But as the Constitutionalists grew stronger, Villa and Zapata grew weaker. Eventually the war against the Conventionalists was won after the assassination of Zapata in 1919 and the surrender of Villa in July 1920. By 1917, the main fighting of the civil war between the two factions was over, with some minor revolts by Felicistas (supporters of Félix Díaz, nephew of ousted president Porfirio Díaz). This marked the end of any real resistance to Carranza.
However, when Carranza's autocratic rule was threatened, the threat would come from the Constitutionalist army he had set up. Carranza was assassinated after he tried to have Obregón arrested on false charges (Obregón was put up for election for president, which threatened Carranza and his choice of successor, Ignacio Bonillas) and Obregón, under the Plan of Agua Prieta,
marched on Mexico City with his army. Carranza fled the capital and was killed in the Sierra Norte of Puebla on 21 May 1920.
In 1920, Obregón was elected president, and some other former Constitutionalist generals would eventually become presidents and leading politicians in the years ahead.

The Young Gods is the eponymous debut studio album by the Swiss industrial rock band The Young Gods, released in 1987 by Play It Again Sam, Organik and Wax Trax! Records. The album employs a sample-based approach to rock music: the tracks are composed from samples from metal guitar riffs and classical compositions. The Young Gods was produced by Roli Mosimann, who went on to become a frequent collaborator of the band. It is the band's only record to feature their original drummer, Frank Bagnoud.
The Young Gods met with a critical acclaim, with a particular interest from the British music press: it was named as the "Album of the Year" by Melody Maker. The album peaked at number 14 on UK Independent Albums Chart, while its sole single, "Did You Miss Me?," charted on the UK Independent Singles Chart.
Background and recording
The Young Gods formed in Geneva in 1985, after Fribourg-native guitarist Franz Treichler decided to assemble a band for his sound collage compositions. The band started rehearsing and performing with the inclusion of sampler player Cesare Pizzi and drummer Frank Bagnoud. After a series of early gigs, the trio signed to the Swiss label Organik, which was a subsidiary of RecRec Music. Their self-financed debut single, "Envoyé!," was released in 1986 to positive reviews and publicity. It was named as "the Single of the Week" by Melody Maker; the band soon started touring in Europe and the United Kingdom. The success of the single won the band a recording deal with the Belgian label Play It Again Sam.
The band soon started recording their debut album with Roli Mosimann. Treichler had previously met with Mosimann during the latter's tenure as the drummer of Swans. The album was recorded at the Artag Studio in Zurich, Switzerland. According to Treichler, Mosimann was heavily involved in the songwriting and arrangement process.
Music and lyrics
On The Young Gods, the band used the sampler as a compositional tool: the tracks are constructed from classical and rock/metal guitar samples. On the band's arrangements, David Stubbs of The Quietus wrote: "They used artifice and synthesis, mechanically retrieving the sounds of the dead rock (and classical) past, but forging them in such a way as to create something bold, grandiose and absolutely new under the sun." Treichler's vocals were described as "leering" and "guttural." The tracks often deviate from the standard verse–chorus form. The band have described their music as "new sonic architecture."
The track "Nous de la lune" features a martial beat, tolling bells, and "a vomiting, bass growl" by Treichler. "Jusqu'au About" was characterized by "exhaust fume sputters of revving guitar," while the track "A ciel ouvert" features "Treichler's melodramatic, pterodactyl-like screams." "Did You Miss Me?," a cover of Gary Glitter's "Hello, Hello, I'm Back Again," was constructed from string samples and was compared to the works of Laibach. The track features an audience sample from a Yello live album. "Jimmy" was described as a "furious punk" track. The tracks "Percussione" and "Feu" are driven by "primitive, muscle-powered percussion" and "a looped riff", respectively. "Envoyé!," featured on the CD version, consists of a "motorik percussion, gunshots, an abbreviated hair metal riff;" the track was likened to "techno played by a speed-metal band." "Comme si était la dernière fois," another CD bonus track, features a slowed down guitar riff from The Ruts.
The lyrics on The Young Gods are sung in French, except for "Did You Miss Me?" and "The Irrtum Boys."
Release and reception
The Young Gods was released in April 1987 on Play It Again Sam and Organik. Wax Trax! Records handled the North American release. The record received a critical success in the United Kingdom and peaked at number 14 on UK Independent Albums Chart. The band regularly relocated to London for the accompanying tour.
AllMusic critic Ned Raggett wrote: "Even if the uniqueness of the Young Gods' sample-based compositional and playing method of heavy rock wasn't a question, the band's debut would still have caught many a discerning ear." Raggett further added: "While not consistently strong throughout, this self-titled effort has far more hits than misses to its overall credit." Music critic Robert Christgau noted the tracks "Feu" and "Did You Miss Me" as notable cuts from the record. Simon Reynolds of Melody Maker praised the record, stating that the record "looks like the most creative record released this year." Reynolds further stated that the band "takes sampling beyond the dance functionalism which limits hip hop. Where most pop is linear, horizontal, The Young Gods open up space along the vertical." Trouser Press wrote: "Bombastic would be a gross understatement, but when ability matches ambition, The Young Gods has a uniquely menacing majesty."
The album was chosen as the "Album of the Year" by Melody Maker in 1987. It was also included on Sounds magazine's lists of "Albums of the Year" and "The Top 80 Albums from the '80s" in 1987 and 1989, respectively. In 2010, Spin featured the record on its list of essential industrial metal albums.

Tachileik (also spelt Tachilek; , ; , ; , , ), is a border town in the Shan State of eastern Myanmar. It is the administrative seat of Tachileik Township and Tachileik District and most populated city in eastern Shan State with 51,553 residents per 2014 census count, ahead of Kyaing Tong, but only 4th statewide. It faces Mae Sai in Thailand.
History
Tachileik was a border crossing used in the opium trade from the Golden Triangle, at pbase.com, archived here on 9 February 2005 by Internet Archive and was the town that the drug lord Khun Sa used to live in.
On 24 March 2011 a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the region very close to Tachileik. It caused some damage as far away as Chiang Mai.
On 24 March 2012, a bomb wounded 2 people at the Regina Hotel golf course in Tachileik, followed by a second bomb that exploded an hour later.
Climate
Transport
Tachileik has an airport which links to four Burmese cities – Yangon, Mandalay, Taungyi Heho and Kengtung. By road Tachileik is connected to Kengtung, which lies 106 km (66 miles) to the north, by the Asian Highway route AH2, and via Kengtung west to Taunggyi, capital of Shan State, and east by route AH3 to Mongla and on to Yunnan Province, China.
Border crossing
Tachileik can be accessed from the Thai town of Mae Sai, which sits directly south on the other side of the small Mae Sai River. There are two bridges that provide access between Mae Sai and Tachilek, one is actively used for border crossings and the other newer one was not yet being used as of January 2007.
It may be possible for tourists to take a bicycle across the bridge, but logistically it would be difficult. It is a porous border and is actually not difficult to wade across the river. Burmese merchants used to be able to cross over and do business in Mae Sai for days at a time. The border is also a popular destination for Westerners (referred to locally as farang) who either reside in or are visiting Thailand and who need to get their passport visas renewed.
There is no charge for a 'visa run' going from Thailand to Burma on the Thai side, but there is a charge of US$10 or 500 Thai Baht on the Burmese side.
Tourism
The crowning tourist attraction is a large gold-colored stupa, which, among other things, showcases the seven days of the week. The idea is for a pilgrim to go to the spot which has the day he/she was born known as the planetary post, and do a simple spiritual ritual.
West of town there are hiking trails, though currently they are designated for locals, not for tourists. There is an Akha hill tribe, over an hour's walk north-west of Tachilek called Ho Yu. There are no maps and no guides for such excursions, and Burmese authorities frown on foreign visitors leaving the beaten track. Perhaps in the future, Tachilek authorities will lighten up on their restrictions for tourists, but for the foreseeable future: trekking, hiking, exploring, rock climbing, camping, and enjoying the river are not allowed.
Pasa Wildlife Reserve is located in the eastern side of the district.
Economy
In 2009, it was reported that Tachileik vendors openly sold endangered animal parts. Located immediately following the bridge that divides Myanmar and Thailand is a marketplace that sells a large variety of products, including DVDs, perfume, clothing, luggage, and wine.
Tachileik once had the reputation as a distribution nexus for heroin and ya ba (methamphetamine pills) moving from rural Myanmar to the world market. The Western media's reports said the drugs were manufactured and distributed by a number of armed groups in Myanmar.

Miksa Róth (26 December 1865 – 14 June 1944) was a Hungarian mosaicist and stained glass artist responsible for making mosaic and stained glass prominent art forms in Hungarian art. In part, Róth was inspired by the work of Pre-Raphaelite artists Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris.
Róth apprenticed at his father, Zsigmond Róth's leaded stained glass studio. Starting a business in 1885, he would make commissions for a number of buildings, largely in Budapest, including the Hungarian Parliament Building and the Buda Castle. Róth also received a number of commissions outside the country as well, for example the National Theatre of Mexico.

In Hawaiian mythology, an ʻaumakua (; often spelled aumakua, plural, aumākua) is a personal or family god that originated as a deified ancestor, and which takes on physical forms such as spirit vehicles. An 'aumakua may manifest as a shark, owl, bird, octopus, or inanimate objects such as plants or rocks. The word ʻaumakua means ancestor gods and is derived from the Hawaiian words au which means period of time or era, and makua meaning parent, parent generation, or ancestor. Hawaiians believed that deceased family members would transform into ʻaumakua and watch over their descendants with a loving concern for them while also being the judge and jury of their actions.
ʻAumakua were believed to watch over their families and hear their words, give them strength and guidance, warn them of misfortune or danger, give punishments to wrong-doers while also rewarding worthy people with prosperity in the afterlife, and pass on prayers from the living to the akua (gods).
Hawaiian-born actor Jason Momoa has a halfsleeve tattoo on his left forearm that is a tribute to his family god, or aumakua, which is a shark. Some families had many ʻaumākua. Mary Kawena Pukui's family had at least fifty known ʻaumākua.
Roles of ʻAumākua
ʻAumakua could give warnings of coming misfortune or danger, punishments, and guidance to their respective ʻohana (families). ʻAumakua relayed these messages to family members through hōʻike a ka pō (revelation in the night, dreams), visions, or physical manifestations. Hawaiians also believed that “just the nagging feeling that something is wrong” was a message sent from their ʻaumakua.
ʻAumakua were also protectors of their families. An example of this comes from the Puna district on Hawaiʻi island which was shared with anthropologist Martha Beckwith: “...this one family… had a supernatural helper or aumakua who appeared in the form of a particular shark. When any of the family go fishing, the shark appears. The aumakua obeys the voice of man. Name the fish you want and it will bring it. This family can never be drowned. If there is a storm and the boat capsizes, the shark appears and the men ride on its back.”
As protectors, ʻaumakua could also give mental or physical strength to ʻohana members who were in need of help but could not help themselves, primarily the keiki (children), the sick, and the elderly.
ʻAumakua could also bring punishment to families who offended or displeased them. These offenses included behavior like greed, dishonesty, and theft, breaking ʻai kapu (link to ʻai kapu article), bathing in pools that were kapu (taboo), and eating the physical form of ones ʻaumakua. Punishments were often illnesses in the form of “diagnostic clues”, so a thief would develop a swollen hand or a sore foot would trouble a trespasser until they made restitution.
ʻAumakua also acted as judge and jury after a person's death. They had the power to punish or reward the personʻs spirit depending on whether or not that person lived a righteous life, or even send the spirit back to the body if it left the body prematurely in “apparent deaths”.
Physical forms
ʻAumākua could appear as:
ʻalalā - crow
manō - shark
pueo - a species of short-eared owl
heʻe - octopus
mea kanu - plant
pōhaku - rock
mo'o - lizard
Moa wahine - Mud hen
Puhi - Eel
ʻIole liʻiliʻi - Small field mice
Peʻelua - Caterpillars
ʻAumakua were able to take on Kino lau (many bodies, many forms) which means that they could change back and forth from “invisible people'' (poʻe or ka pō), animals, plants, and minerals. ʻAumakua as animals could also inhabit plants that had similar characteristics or visual resemblance to that animal. For example, ʻaumakua as mackerel (ʻōpelu) were also associated with the lobelia plant (also called ʻōpleu) whose leaves are a similar shape and color as the fish.
In media
The 2016 Nintendo video games Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon, which are set in a fictional archipelago inspired by the real-world location of Hawaii, make reference to various aspects of Hawaiian culture, including the 'aumakua. Tapu Koko is called the guardian deity of Melemele Island and has a mask-like shell that looks like a stylized rooster head.
In the 2016 Disney animated film Moana, the concept of the 'aumakua is an inspiration for Tala's transformation into a manta ray; the Aumakua is referenced by name in pre-production artwork.
In "Ka laina ma ke one" ("Line in the Sand"), a seventh season episode of the U.S. television series Hawaii Five-O, Kono Kalakaua mentions that her family's aumakua is the manō, which motivates her to protect them.

Farsley Celtic Football Club is a football club based in Farsley, West Yorkshire, England. The club was founded in 1908, but folded in 2010 and were reformed as Farsley AFC before returning to the name Farsley Celtic in 2015. They are currently members of and play at The Citadel.
History
The club was established in 1908 as Farsley Football Club and played in amateur leagues in Leeds. They joined the West Riding County Amateur League in 1926 and were runners-up in 1936–37. In 1949 they joined Division Two of the Yorkshire League. They won the Division in 1951–52, earning promotion to Division One. After three bottom-half finishes, league performances improved and Farsley finished fifth in 1955–56 and fourth in 1956–57, before ending the season as runners-up in both 1957–58 and 1958–59. The 1959–60 season saw them win the league for the first time, and throughout the 1960s the club finished in the top seven of the league. They were champions again in 1968–69 and runners-up in 1970–71 and 1971–72. In 1974–75 the club reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 2–0 at home to Third Division Tranmere Rovers in a match moved to Elland Road to accommodate the record 11,000 crowds. After finishing in the bottom four of Division One the following season, the club were relegated to Division Two. The following season saw them finish fourth in Division Two, earning promotion back to Division One. However, their stay in Division One only lasted one season as they were relegated again at the end of the 1977–78 season. After three years in Division Two they were promoted back to Division One at the end of the 1980–81 season.
In 1982 the Yorkshire League merged with the Midland League to form the Northern Counties East League, with Farsley placed in Division One North. They remained in the division until winning it in 1984–85, after which they were promoted to the Premier Division. In 1986–87 they were Premier Division runners-up, earning promotion to the newly formed Division One of the Northern Premier League. The club remained in the division for seventeen seasons until a third-place finish in 2003–04 saw them promoted to the Premier Division. Their first season in the Premier Division ended in controversy; Spennymoor United failed to fulfil their fixtures as they folded and the league opted to expunge their results, leaving Farsley ending the season as league champions. However, the Football Association over-ruled the league, awarding three points to all clubs who had not played Spennymoor at the time they had stopped playing. This meant that both Hyde United and Workington moved above Farsley in the table, with Hyde gaining automatic promotion. Farsley attempted to overturn the decision in the High Court, but were unsuccessful and subsequently entered the play-offs. After beating Whitby Town 1–0 in the semi-finals, they lost to Workington on penalties in the final.
In 2005–06 Farsley finished fourth in the Premier Division, again qualifying for the play-offs. After beating Marine 1–0 in the semi-finals, they defeated North Ferriby United 2–1 in the final to earn promotion to the Conference North. A second successive promotion was achieved the following season when a fifth-place finish in the Conference North saw them again qualify for the playoffs. They went on to beat Kettering Town 4–2 on aggregate in the semi-finals, before beating Hinckley United 4–3 in the final at the Pirelli Stadium. They also reached the first round of the FA Cup again, eventually losing 2–0 in a replay to Milton Keynes Dons after the home match had ended 0–0. The club's first season in the Conference National ended in relegation back to the Conference North. Financial problems led to the club being expelled from the league prior to the 2009–10 season, although they were readmitted shortly afterwards. However, they subsequently went into administration and were expelled from the Conference in March 2010 after being unable to fulfil their fixtures, before being disbanded on 10 March.
The club was reformed as Farsley A.F.C. and joined the Premier Division of the Northern Counties East League for the 2010–11 season. They went on to win the division, earning promotion to Division One North of the Northern Premier League. A fourth-place finish in 2011–12 saw them qualify for the play-offs, losing 3–0 to Witton Albion in the semi-finals. In 2015 the club returned to the name Farsley Celtic. They finished second in 2016–17, again qualifying for the play-offs. After beating Colne 4–0 in the semi-finals, the club defeated Ossett Town 4–2 in the final to earn promotion to the Premier Division. The following season saw the club finish fifth in the Premier Division, reaching the play-offs. However, they were beaten 2–1 in the semi-finals by Ashton United. In 2018–19 the club were Premier Division champions, earning promotion to the National League North.
In 2019 the club changed their playing colours from blue to green and white, adopted a new badge and renamed their ground following a takeover by Paul Barthorpe.
Ground
The club moved to Throstle Nest in 1948. Following the club's collapse into administration in 2009, Leeds City Council purchased the ground from the administrators and sold it to the owners of the new club, Farsley A.F.C., while retaining the adjoining sports hall and land proposed for new football pitches. The ground was renamed The Citadel in 2019.

Catherine Schell (born Katherina Freiin Schell von Bauschlott, 17 July 1944) is a Hungarian-born actress who came to prominence in British film and television productions from the 1960s. Her notable roles include the Bond girl Nancy in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), Lady Claudine Litton in The Return of the Pink Panther (1975), Countess Scarlioni in the Doctor Who serial City of Death (1979), and a regular role as Maya in Series Two of the television series Space: 1999 (1975).
Early life
Schell's father, Baron Paul Schell von Bauschlott, was a Hungarian diplomat of three-quarter Magyar ancestry; her mother was Countess Katharina Maria Etelka Georgina Elisabeth Teleki de Szék. "Schell" is the family name, while "von Bauschlott" indicates the place in Germany where the Schell family owned its main estate.
Fleeing Hungary in advance of the Soviets and communism, the family lived in poverty until 1948, finding asylum in Austria: first in Vienna, then in Salzburg. In 1950, the family emigrated to the United States, where Schell's father acquired American citizenship.
Schell entered a convent school in the New York City borough of Staten Island. In 1957, her father joined Radio Free Europe and the family moved to Munich where Schell developed an interest in acting and attended the Otto Falckenberg School of the Performing Arts.
Career
Film
She acted under the alternate names "Catherine von Schell", "Catherina von Schell", and "Katherina von Schell" early in her career. Under the latter name, she made her film debut as the title character in the little-known German-language film Lana, Queen of the Amazons (1964). She appeared as Bond girl Nancy in the James Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), with George Lazenby in the lead. Around the same time, she appeared in Hammer Films science-fiction thriller Moon Zero Two (also 1969) cast in the role of Clementine Taplin. She appeared with Bette Davis, now credited as Catherine Schell, in Madame Sin (1972), a television film made by ITC which was released theatrically in some markets.
Schell appeared opposite Peter Sellers in the comedy The Return of the Pink Panther (1975) as Lady Claudine Lytton. It is regularly claimed that her apparent tendency for uncontrollable laughter, or corpsing, at Sellers' antics as Inspector Clouseau is an example of breaking character. Reputedly, the film shows Schell attempting to stifle laughter at Sellers's performance in a handful of scenes. Schell has maintained in interviews that she considered it in character for Lady Lytton to be amused by Clouseau, whom she does not see as a serious threat. Schell appeared with Sellers again in The Prisoner of Zenda (1979), one of his last films.
Television
Schell's first TV credit was Till Eulenspiegel (1967), a West German comedy in which she played Nele and was billed as Katherina von Schell.
Schell spent much of her career in British television, appearing in more than 47 series spanning a period of nearly 30 years. She played regular roles in series such as The Adventurer, Looking For Clancy, One by One, Mog and Wish Me Luck, in addition to many guest appearances, including The Persuaders!, The Troubleshooters, Arthur of the Britons, Return of the Saint, The Sweeney, The Onedin Line, The Gentle Touch, Lovejoy, Bergerac, The Bill, Howards' Way and The Search for the Nile.
Schell appeared in the science-fiction series Space: 1999 as a robotic servant ("Guardian of Piri", 1975), and returned to the series in its second season as the regular character Maya, a shape-shifting "metamorph" from the planet Psychon. Schell appeared in another British science-fiction series, as Countess Scarlioni in the Doctor Who serial City of Death (1979).
Personal life
Family
Schell's brother, Paul Rudolf (born 1940), now known as Paul von Schell, has acted in German-language productions. A younger brother, Peter (1941–68), died young. Through a German great-grandfather, Schell is related to Louis XIV of France (1638–1715), Philip II, Duke of Orléans (1674–1723), Regent of France and Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor (1708–65). She is not believed to be related to the Austrian-Swiss actors Maximilian and Maria Schell.
Marriages
While filming Amsterdam Affair in 1968, Schell met and married her first husband, British actor William Marlowe (1930–2003), and moved to London. The marriage ended in divorce in 1977. Schell married director Bill Hays (1938–2006) in 1982. In 1984, they worked together for the first time as husband and wife on a TV production of Ivan Turgenev's play A Month in the Country.
Retirement
Schell's career continued into the mid-1990s, after which she retired from acting and opened Chambre d'Hôtes Valentin, a small guesthouse in Bonneval, Haute-Loire, France, which would become a popular destination for fans of Space: 1999. She reportedly sold the inn after the death of her second husband in 2006.
Schell made her first convention appearance at MainMission:2000, a celebration of the 25th anniversary of Space: 1999 held in New York City. To date, she has appeared at only one other convention, mainly due to her second husband's declining health.
Schell contributed a foreword to the Space: 1999 novel Born for Adversity, written by David McIntee and published by Powys Media in 2010.
Schell's autobiography A Constant Alien was published in 2016.
She subsequently came out of acting retirement to portray the Grand Duchess Valeria in the BBC One/Netflix series Dracula, which aired in 2020.

Bhabanipur () is a sacred site around Karatoya located about from Sherpur Upazila of Bogra District, Rajshahi Division, Bangladesh. It is one of the Shakti Pithas of the Indian subcontinent.
Significance
According to the Purana, in the Satya Yuga, King Daksha (Son of Lord Bramha) arranged a ritual called Yagya in which hisr daughter Goddess Sati and Her husband "Lord Shiva" was not invited. Still Goddess Sati attended the function. Unable to bear the insult towards Her husband Lord Shiva, Goddess Sati protested by sacrificing Herself into the fire of the Yagna. Enraged with grief, Lord Shiva started the dance of destruction across the Universe with the corpse of Goddess Sati on His shoulder. To stop this, Lord Vishnu cut the corpse of Goddess Sati with the Sudharshan Chakra and as a result the various pieces of Goddess Sati's body and Her ornaments fell at various places of the Indian subcontinent. These places are now known as Shakti Pithas. Shakti Pithas are holy abode of the Mother Goddess. Each temple have shrines for Shakti and Kalabhairava. The Shakti of Bhabanipur shrine is addressed as "Aparna" and the "Bhairava" as "Vaman". It is believed that Sati Devi's Left anklet fell here.
The Shakti devi here is called Aparna and the Bhairava is Vaman. The part of "Sati" Maa Tara's body fell at Bhabanipur could be left anklet (ornament), ribs of left chest, right eye, or bedding (according to various sources).
Being a Shakti Pith, Bhabanipur is a historic place of pilgrimage for the followers of Hinduism. There are numerous temples at this Shakti-pith premises which are visited by pilgrims from all over the country and abroad, irrespective of sectarian differences.
Legend
There is a legend saying that while once a conch-bangles dealer was passing by the side of a lonely pond in a dense jungle near the then Bhabanipur temple, a little girl with a tip of vermilion on her forehead approached him and told him that she was the daughter of the Natore Rajbari (Palace). She bought a pair of conch-bangles from him and requested him to collect the price of that bangles from the then Maharani Bhabani from a basket kept in the Rajbari at a specified place. Her appearance and polite words overwhelmed the conch-dealer. The Maharani (Queen) rushed to the place/site with her men and the conch-dealer as soon as she heard this from him. On the earnest prayer by the conch-dealer, Ma Bhabani raised from that pond showing her two wrists with the conch-bangles worn. The Maharani and the men present there were surprised, and the divinity of Mother Bhabani spread throughout this subcontinent. This is that sacred "Shakha-Pukur" (conch-bangles pond) where the devotees take their holy bath when they go there.
Temples
Surrounded by a boundary wall, the Temple comprises about an area of four acres (12 bighas) - Main Temple, Belbaran Tala, 4 Shiva Temples, Patal Bhairava Shiva Temple, Gopal Temple, Bashudev Temple and Nat Mandir. On the north side, there is a Sheba Angan, Holy Shakha-Pukur (conch-bangles pond), 2 bathing ghats, 4 Shiva Temples outside the boundary wall and a Panchamunda Asana.
Worship, rituals and festivals
Pravati and Balya Bhog worship and Anna Bhog at noon, and Arati and Bhog at evening. Devotees can offer Bhog to the divine mother "Tara" (Ma Bhabani) every day and take Prasad later.
Every year, festivals take place at the Bhabanipur Temple premises on auspicious occasions. They are:
Maghi Purnima in the Bengali month of Magh/Falgun
Ram Nabomi in the month of Chaitra/Baishakh
Durgotshov in autumn
Dipannita Shyama Puja
Nabanna in the month of Aghrahoyon
Communication
Devotees can go to Bhabanipur from Dhaka via Jamuna Bridge and after passing Chandaikona in Sirajganj District, they can reach Ghoga Bot-tola bus stoppage on the same highway from where they can reach the Bhabanipur Temple premises by availing themselves of van or scooter. Pilgrims from the districts located to the North of Bogra can reach the Bhabanipur Temple premises by passing through Sherpur, Mirzapur and Ghoga Bot-tola (bus stoppage) of Bogra district.
Temple management
The Bhabanipur Temple Renovation, Development and Management Committee had been successfully supervising the temple activities and Ma Bhabani's properties from 1991 up until 2010. On 13 February 2007, Combined Forces of that time (Special law enforcement forces) destroyed the Guest House which was under construction by the committee for the devotees.

Ashburton College is a state coeducational secondary school located in Ashburton, New Zealand. It opened in 1965 following the merger of two Ashburton secondary schools: Ashburton High School and Hakatere College, and moved to its current site in 1974. Serving Years 9 to 13, Ashburton College has a roll of students as of .
Enrolment
Ashburton College is naturally zoned by the school's relative isolation (the nearest alternative state secondary school is Mount Hutt College, 35 km away in Methven), therefore does not need to operate an enrolment scheme. The school has an effective service area of the entire township of Ashburton and much of the coastal half of Mid-Canterbury, with Mount Hutt College in Methven, Ellesmere College in Leeston, Geraldine High School in Geraldine, and the Pacific Ocean bounding the Ashburton College service area to the west, north, south and east respectively.
At the April 2013 Education Review Office (ERO) review of the school, the school had 1173 students enrolled, including twelve international students. Fifty-one percent of students were male and 49 percent were female. Seventy-seven percent of students identified as New Zealand European (Pākehā), ten percent as Māori, four percent as Pacific Islanders, three percent as Asian, and six percent as another ethnicity.
Critical praise
In 2012 Ashburton College was first equal in The Clean Green Business Award, won the Large Business Award and was also named the Overall Supreme Award winner in the Ashburton Business Association biennial business awards.
In 2008, The Education Review Office ranked the school the top in the country for the promotion of male's learning.
Statistics from the 2008 NCEA results ranked the school fifth in performance out of the 19 decile seven to nine schools.
Ashburton College in the Media
Media Coverage.
Given Ashburton College's status as the much larger of two secondary schools in Mid Canterbury and the only secondary school based in Ashburton (Mount Hutt College is in Methven) the local newspaper, The Ashburton Courier provides coverage of the College's activities.
NCEA Statistics.
Ashburton College has consistently improved its performance in NCEA over recent years. In 2014 the College achieved a 90% pass rate across all Year 11 students, which is significantly higher than the national or decile scores. This result was also reflected in all sub-groups (e.g. gender, ethnicity) in Year 11.
Similar results and trends were also achieved for NCEA levels 2 and 3 (Years 12 and 13) students.

Bhrama (Sanskrit: भ्रम), in the context of Hindu thought, means – error, mistake, illusion, confusion, perplexity. But, it literally means – that which is not steady; and refers to error etc., caused by defects in the perceptive system. The seeing of snake in a rope in darkness, silver nacre in moonlight, water in a mirage on a hot day and a person in a stump of tree are four classic instances quoted in Vedantic texts. Bhrama is a mistake, it is a confusion about one object which exists for another object which does not exist, it merely refers to the fallibility of human perception.
Human nature is ordinarily afflicted by - भ्रमप्रमादविप्रलिप्साकरणापाटवदोषाः – i.e. bhrama (false knowledge or mistakes), pramāda (inattention or misunderstanding reality), vipralipsā (cheating propensity) and karaṇa-a-pāṭava (imperfection of the senses) are four major mind-faults which mislead human beings and do not permit right perception and cognition. Amongst these, the knowledge which is of the nature of bhrama is the direct thought-wave of avidya. And, the texts speak about there being five theories of illusion or erroneous perception – Ātmakhyāti (Yogacara theory of subjective apprehension), Asatkhyāti (Madhyamaka theory of the nonexistent), Akhyāti (Prabhākara's theory of non-apprehension), Anyathākhyati (Nyaya theory of misapprehension) and Anirvacanīyakhyāti (Advaita Vedanta theory of apprehension of the indeterminate), developed by five schools of thought.
The Vedantic texts reveal the Self as Pure Consciousness; they reveal the Self as the ever blissful witness who is neither the enjoyer nor the enjoyment or the object of enjoyment. The enjoyer is Chidabhasa or Jiva, the sheath of the intellect, a product or manifestation of Maya, not transcendentally real and subject to change. Vidyaranya in his Panchadasi (VII.9-10) explains:-
अधिष्ठानांशसंयुक्तं भ्रमाशमवलम्बते |
यदा तदाऽहं संसारीत्येवं जीवोऽभिमन्यते ||
"When Jiva, having the immutable Kutastha as his basis, wrongly identifies himself with the gross and subtle bodies, he comes to think of himself as bound by the pleasures and pains of this world."
भ्रमांश्स्य तिरस्कारदधिष्ठानप्रधानता |
यदा तदा चिदात्माहामसङ्गोऽस्मीति बुद्धयते ||
"When Jiva gives up his attachment to his illusory portion, the nature of the substratum becomes predominant and he realizes that he is associationless and of the nature of pure consciousness."
Swami Swahananda in his commentary tells us that Kutastha, conventionally identified with ego, is not the object of identification for it is incapable of being associated with ego.
According to Shankara, atma-anatma adhyasa, the so-called locus of superimposition, is a mispresentation or proksha-aproksha bhrama. Panchapadika pf Padmapada interprets purovasthitava (the object in front) as contact with the visual sense, whereas Ratnaprabha of Niścalakara relates it with sense-contact; the former explains that a non-object can become an apparent object and the latter explains that Shankara in no way considers the said locus to be complete and conclusive.
Saguna (with attributes) worship leads to a typical illusion in as much as the devotee mistakes physical or mental images for the formless God; it is of the nature of the Samvadi-bhrama that finally leads to the realization of Nirguna Brahman, the endless pursuit after sense-objects is the Visamvadi-bhrama. But, the cumulative subtle awareness of bhrama need not necessarily result in the awareness of Maya because owing to the latter either one wakes up from a dream or goes on dreaming forever.
Svarūpa-bhrama (illusion about spirituality) is one of the four major anarthas (useless, meaningless, disastrous, wrongdoings) and is said to be of four kinds – sva-tattva which is illusion about one's own spiritual identity, para-tattva which is illusion about the spiritual identity of the supreme absolute truth, sādhya-sādhana-tattva which is illusion about the spiritual means and the object gained, and māyā-tattva which is illusion about the Lord's external energy. These anarthas are required to be uprooted in order to develop niśṭa (devotion). But, bhrama is not an āropa (imposing of, imputation, figurative substitution) which is an āhārya (wilfully caused in spite of falsity) cognition.
The Yoga School of thought adopts the Anyathākhyati theory of misapprehension of the Nyayas for dealing with bhrama, which theory is based on the premise that bhrama is thinking of something as that which it is not, like attributing the characteristics of Prakrti to Purusha and vice versa.
In Ayurveda, bhrama refers to Vertigo, a discreet disease due to Vata prakopa and Pitta prakopa which shows six distinct stages, and is curable.

Reg Strikes Back is the 21st studio album by English musician Elton John. Released in 1988, it was his self-proclaimed comeback album, and his own way of fighting back against bad press. The "Reg" in Reg Strikes Back refers to John's birth name, Reginald Kenneth Dwight.
In the US, the album was certified gold in August 1988 by the RIAA. It was also John's third studio album in the 1980's to be placed inside the top 20 of US Billboard 200 (number 16, 1988).
Background
This was the last album that bassist Dee Murray (albeit without bass) appeared on prior to his death in 1992. Additionally, Nigel Olsson, the longtime drummer for John's band, appears (without drums) on backing vocals. John brought back record producer Chris Thomas for the album. This was the first studio album to be recorded and released after John's throat surgery the previous year. The album cover featured costumes from John's collection that he decided to put up for auction.
The tracks "I Don't Wanna Go On with You Like That" and "A Word in Spanish" peaked at No. 2 and No. 19 on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively.
While in the UK, "I Don't Wanna Go On with You Like That" was the only song from the album to reach the Top 40 there, reaching #30 as the follow-up "Town of Plenty" and "A Word in Spanish" appears outside the Top 40 on the same chart, peaking at #74 and #91.
Tour
After taking over a year off (to recover from throat surgery, address personal issues and record Reg Strikes Back in London), John returned to the stage with a new rhythm section. He wanted more of an R&B sound to his material, so drummer Jonathan Moffett and bassist Romeo Williams, along with backing singers Marlena Jeter, Natalie Jackson and Alex Brown, were added to the band. Guitarist Davey Johnstone, now also in the role of music director, had assembled the new band, a task that he continues to do.
The band's first show was at an AIDS benefit at the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles, where they played a 14-song set that featured the never-released John/Taupin composition, "Love Is Worth Waiting For". The US tour then began on 9 September at the Miami Arena in Miami, Florida and concluded on 22 October at New York's Madison Square Garden.
After recording the follow-up album Sleeping With The Past in Denmark, the band (now with backing vocalist Mortonette Jenkins instead of Alex Brown) resumed their tour on 20 March 1989 at La Halle Tony Garnier in Lyon, France, and played across Eastern Europe and the UK, concluding on 10 June 1989 at the RDS Arena in Dublin.

The Christian Research Institute (CRI) is an evangelical Christian apologetics ministry. It was established in October 1960 in the state of New Jersey by Walter Martin (1928–1989). In 1974, Martin relocated the ministry to San Juan Capistrano, California. The ministry's office was relocated in the 1990s near Rancho Santa Margarita. In 2005, the organization moved to its present location in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Background
The establishment of CRI in 1960 is closely linked to Walter Martin. It represents one of the pioneering organizations in what is called the Christian countercult movement, but also relates to the wider history of Evangelical Christian apologetics in the mid-twentieth century.
Martin is considered one of the first full-time career apologists to have specialized in Christian countercult apologetics. In 1949, Martin began his forays into the theological analysis of various groups, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, Christian Science, Mormonism and Spiritualism. Much of this early work coincided with his tertiary studies at Shelton College and New York University during the 1950s.
In 1953, Martin became acquainted with the Presbyterian radio Bible teacher Donald Grey Barnhouse. Barnhouse was the founding editor (1950) of the monthly periodical Eternity magazine. Stephen Board, in his study of the history of evangelical periodicals, has observed that during its first decade of publishing Eternity was built around Barnhouse's personality and his own particular causes.
In 1954, Barnhouse invited Martin to be a columnist in Eternity magazine, and then between 1955 and 1960 Martin served as a regular contributing editor. Martin wrote a number of articles about cults, which formed the embryonic texts for various books he wrote. However, Martin also wrote book reviews, examined general apologetics and doctrinal issues, and also considered social questions such as alcoholism.
The early 1950s witnessed the publication of several books that Martin wrote, or co-wrote with Norman Klann, such as Jehovah of the Watchtower (1953), The Christian Science Myth (1954), The Rise of the Cults (1955) and The Christian and the Cults (1956). Barnhouse wrote the foreword to The Christian Science Myth, and his support for Martin's ministry was crucial in legitimating countercult apologetics to the wider church constituency. In 1960, Barnhouse died from a brain tumor only a few weeks before Martin formally established CRI. By that time Martin had become an emerging apologist whose ministry and reputation was gaining recognition in parachurch organizations like the American Tract Society, Evangelical Theological Society, National Association of Evangelicals, and National Religious Broadcasters.
Early ministry development
The basic charter for CRI began with the aim of serving as a bureau of information on cults, other religions, and Christian apologetics. Walter Martin subsequently gave this summary profile about CRI: "The Institute's purpose is to supply primary data on all the cults, and non-Christian missionary activities, both here and abroad. It is the function of this Institute to index the major cults and to supply resumes of their origin, history, and doctrines, with bibliographical material aimed at specifically evangelizing and refuting their respective teachings."
CRI was assisted by individual donors and by charitable grants from organizations like the Pew Foundation. CRI was administered by a Board of Directors that included Martin's brother-in-law Everett Jacobson.
In the early 1960s, much of CRI's activities centered on Martin's itinerant preaching ministry in churches and with parachurch organizations. Martin delivered seminars throughout North America on the problems churches and missionaries faced with cults. He utilized the emergence of audio-cassette tapes with several of his seminar presentations recorded and initially distributed by Bible Voice Inc. in New Jersey and the Audio Bible Society in Pennsylvania (later through Vision House and finally by CRI itself).
Martin also developed a profile on radio initially as a co-host of Barnhouse's Bible Study Hour, then as a regular panel guest on the Long John Nebel show in the 1960s. Martin then became the host of his own shows, The Bible Answer Man and Dateline Eternity. The shows became nationally syndicated and accelerated in popularity following the ministry's relocation to California.
Martin sought to develop a library of resources on cults and apologetics, including books, audio files, and periodicals. He encouraged the development of a bureau of speakers associated with CRI, which in the 1960s included figures such as Walter Bjorck, Floyd Hamilton, James Bjornstad and Shildes Johnson. Other prominent theologians who were affiliated with CRI included Harold O. J. Brown and John Warwick Montgomery. The intention was to maintain a network of scholars involved in apologetics.
CRI produced various tracts about the Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses, distributed tapes, books and booklets by Martin, and initially ran a periodical in 1961–62 known as Religious Research Digest. In 1968, the ministry published a 26-page booklet UFO: Friend Foe or Fantasy.
In 1963, Martin conceived of the idea of creating a computer data bank of apologetics information. The concept was subsequently framed under the acronym SENT/EAST (Electronic Answering Search Technology). In 1968, a symposium of scholars was convened in Austria where the plans for CRI's computerized apologetics data bank were presented in lectures by Martin and John Warwick Montgomery. Much of these details were reported in Christianity Today and then in Montgomery's book Computers, Cultural Change and the Christ.
Transfer to California
In 1974 Martin left New Jersey and relocated to California, and this also entailed the transfer of CRI. In the early stages Martin was assisted by Bob and Gretchen Passantino as staff members in CRI. Martin also became part of the teaching faculty of the newly formed Melodyland School of Theology in Anaheim, where countercult apologetics was integrated into the curriculum and the 13,000 volumes of CRI's library was housed there. Later the ministry opened an office in El Toro, and then shifted to larger premises in Irvine.
The upsurge of interest in Martin's work and CRI coincided with the Jesus People revolution, the counterculture, and the social conflicts over new cults in the 1970s. During the 1970s and 1980s a number of younger apologists were mentored by Martin through CRI and included Cal Beisner, Todd Ehrenborg, Craig Hawkins, Carole Hausmann, Kurt Van Gorden, John Weldon, George Mather, Paul Carden, Rich Poll, Robert M. Bowman Jr., Kenneth Samples, and Elliot Miller. The profile of CRI increased with the widespread sales of Martin's book The Kingdom of the Cults (now with approximately 750,000 copies sold), his audio-tape albums, his radio ministry, and his appearances on national television.
Martin was also involved in the establishment of the MA program in apologetics at the Simon Greenleaf School of Law (now Trinity Law School) in 1980. Martin taught there on cults and the occult throughout the 1980s, and was assisted from time to time by Bob and Gretchen Passantino.
In 1977, CRI launched a new quarterly periodical called the Christian Research Institute Newsletter, which in 1978 was retitled Forward. Through this periodical analyses were published about such movements as Hare Krishna, Jonestown, Rajneesh, the New Age and Satanism.
In 1983 CRI established the Instituto Cristão de Pesquisas (ICP), an affiliate ministry in São Paulo, Brazil. Founded by staff researcher Paul Carden, it was eventually led by Martin disciple Paulo Romeiro.
In 1987 Forward was revamped as Christian Research Journal, which was initially devised as a triennial publication. In 1990, the journal was enlarged in size and became a quarterly publication, and has since become a monthly periodical. The Christian Research Journal has won several awards of excellence from the Evangelical Press Association. The journal now covers a wider range of issues in addition to cults, such as general apologetics, ethical apologetics, world religions, and theological controversies. It also includes contributed essays by authors who are not staff members with CRI.
Ministry post-1989
On June 26, 1989, Martin died at his home of a heart attack at age 60. The news of Martin's death was reported in various Christian periodicals. Hank Hanegraaff succeeded Martin as the ministry's president.
Both at the time of Martin's death and then in the immediate years to follow, a number of staff researchers associated with CRI began to emerge as authors of various countercult apologetics books. These authors included Richard Abanes, Robert M. Bowman, Erwin M. de Castro, Craig Hawkins, Robert J. Lyle, Elliot Miller, B. J. Oropeza, Ron Rhodes, and Kenneth Samples. Many of these authors left CRI and started their own organizations or joined others.
Controversies
Countercult apologetics
Due to the controversial nature of the Christian countercult movement, both Martin and CRI have been involved in various theological and social conflicts. During Martin's lifetime a variety of conflicts erupted between himself and various leaders of religious groups, but especially with Mormons. These clashes sometimes led to public debates and even a lawsuit filed by Martin for alleged defamation.
For a short time in the late 1970s CRI and Martin were involved in a controversy over claims that apologists had located part of the manuscript of the Book of Mormon, which allegedly had been plagiarized from a novel by Solomon Spaulding. The case was argued in a book, Who Really Wrote the Book of Mormon? by Wayne Cowdrey, Howard Davis and Donald Scales. However, the case was seriously questioned by Christian apologists and Mormonism critics Jerald and Sandra Tanner in Did Spaulding Write the Book of Mormon? It was also rebutted by Mormon apologists Robert and Rosemary Brown in volume two of their series of books They Lie In Wait To Deceive. Edward Plowman reported on the CRI claims in Christianity Today magazine in July 1977, and then in October 1977 updated his report with evidence that pointed to the collapse in credibility of the claims.
A book entitled Who Really Wrote the Book of Mormon? – The Spalding Enigma (Concordia Publishing House, July 2005) attempts to revive the original argument. Co-authors Cowdrey, Davis, and Vanick attempt to show that Sidney Rigdon did in fact visit Pittsburgh, the last residence of Spalding, before 1820. A paper authored by LDS affiliated research group Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) devoted nearly 130 pages to review the 2005 book and its claims.
Widow of CRI news editor William Alnor gives her account of the controversies involving Walter Martin and Hank Hanegraaff in her account called, "Dueling Bible Answer Men" parts 1 and 2 by Jackie Alnor.
Financial accountability
The "Group for CRI Accountability," which included terminated employees, alleged that CRI's 1992 withdrawal from the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA) was to avoid restrictions on financial dealings with its chief executive, Hank Hanegraaff. After it had rejoined, a 2003 ECFA audit found CRI to be out of compliance with a number of financial standards. This resulted in sanctions requiring that "the board of directors be strengthened" and a "significant reimbursement" be made to CRI. Ministry Watch issued a Donor Alert in 2004 regarding CRI's failure to respond to repeated requests to explain corrective steps it has taken in regard to findings of violations of three of ECFA's Seven Standards of Responsible Stewardship.
Conversion of Hank Hanegraff to Eastern Orthodoxy
CRI President Hank Hanegraff was baptized into the Eastern Orthodox church on Palm Sunday, April 9, 2017. In a subsequent broadcast Hanegraff responded to charges that he had "walked away from the Christian faith" due to his departure from Protestant Christianity. "If I have caused any to stumble I humbly ask for forgiveness. My purpose in reading this is not so much to respond to anyone, but to reassure... I have never been more deeply in love with the Lord Jesus Christ and his body the church." CRI has defended the Eastern Orthodox doctrine of theosis in a video on the CRI website. Hanegraff's conversion has raised questions among evangelicals, who point to major differences between Eastern Orthodoxy and evangelical Protestantism.

Abu Yedda or Ibn Yedda Douanas or Yedder was a Berber leader of the 10th century. He is a member of the tribe of Banu Ifran when he murders his uncle Habbous. The Banu Ifren tribe was unhappy with him. Yedda crosses to Spain with Zenetes troops in 992. Yedda partnered with the Berbers when they defeated the armies of the King of Spain and the Mehdi. He was killed and buried in Spain after the battle. His family governed in Cordoba for three centuries.
History of Abu Yeddas and his sons
Version 1
He murdered his cousin Yeddou from the Banou Ifren tribe. Subsequently, he moved to Spain and became a military leader of the Berber rebellion in Spain around 1009.
Version 2
According to Slane's version, Abu Yeddas Ibn Dounas killed Habbous Ibn Ziri, leader of the Banu Ifren dynasty. A revolt then broke out against Abu Yeddas. The latter decides to go with his brothers to Spain. At that time, the Umayyads of Spain were going through an internal crisis. Abu Yeddas enjoyed a title as a sovereign due to his bravery. He was gifted in the art of war. In 1009, El Mostain gathers all the Berbers of Spain and names Cordoba as capital and declares war on El Mehdi. The latter had capitulated in Cordoba and he went to seek help from Don Raymond tale of Barcelona. El Mehdi and the King of Galicia will march against El Mostain. Abu Yeddas will die in battle, but the battle will be won by the Berbers. Abu Yeddas will be buried at the very place of this glorious battle of the Berbers, on the edge of Guadiaro in the province of Cadiz. He will be venerated by all the Berbers of Spain. Subsequently, the sons and grandsons of Abu Yeddas will have to govern the entire province of Cordoba in the tenth century.

List of governors during the Hammudite dynasty:
Khalouf (son of Abu Yeddas)
Temim Ibn Khalouf
Yahia (son of Abderhamane, son of Attaf)
History of the brothers of Abu Yeddas
According to Ibn Khaldoun, Abou Yeddas went to Spain with his brothers, Abou Corra, Abou Zeid and Attaf
Abu Nour takes Rounda by force around 1014 from the Umayyad hands. He declares the province independent and belongs to the Banou Ifren family. Around 1058, Abu Nour was invited to his rival Ibn Abbad, lord of Seville. Ibn Abbad will try to trap Abu Nour by presenting him with a letter from a supposed concubine of his son. Abu Nour decides to kill his son because he had a concubine. In the end, Abu Nour discovers the truth, that is, Abu Abbad plotted an ambush targeting Abu Nour directly. The latter will die of grief.
Around 1065, Abu Nasr subsequently took power, being the second son of Abu Nour. He will be killed in treachery by a member of his bodyguard, who was in the service of Ibn Abbad.
Another version of the facts according to Firas Tayyib:
The son of Corra, Abou Nour will be lord of Ronda and Seville in Andalusia from 1023 to 1039 and from 1039 to 1054. Nour Badis ben Hallal's son from 1054 to 1057 in Ronda. Abou Nacer from 1057 to 1065 in Ronda.
The Banou Ifren flag in Ronda was white and red.

the Boroughs of :
Bolivar
New Florence
Seward
all of St. Clair Township
and part of Fairfield Township.

Archidamia () (c. 340-241 BC) was a Spartan queen, wife of Eudamidas I, mother of Archidamus IV and Agesistrata, grandmother of Eudamidas II, and great-grandmother of Agis IV.
War
Siege of Sparta
Archidamia served as Queen of Sparta with her husband Eudamidas I (331 BC – c. 305 BC). In 272 BC when Pyrrhus decided to attack Sparta in the siege of Sparta. Ruling was Archidamia's grandson Eudamidas II in conjunction with King Areus I (r. 309–265 BC). With the pending siege the Spartan Gerousia planned to evacuate the women to Crete. However, Archidamia, speaking on behalf of the Spartan women, entered the Gerousia, "with sword in hand," and contested this proposal, questioning whether the Spartan women were "so faint hearted as to live after Sparta was destroyed". Famously she asked "Spartans! I ask, by the memory of your race, Are ye worthy of the name!" before ending her speech with "her women can die, and be free". With her speech given the Women of Sparta were given a role in the siege.
Women in War
With the matter settled, the Spartans initiated the construction of a defensive trench running parallel to Pyrrhus's camp. Archidamia direct the Spartan women in task, since it is reported that the Spartan women impressively "completed with their own hands a third of the trench." Consequently, Archidamia led the efforts of Spartan women during the subsequent battle against Pyrrhus, as they are noted for supplying the defenders with weapons and refreshment during combat, and extracting wounded from the battlefield.
Later life
Later records of Archidamia date three decades later, with her assisting in the revolutionary designs of her grandson/great-grandson Agis IV, as he attempted to restore Lycurgan institutions to a Sparta then thoroughly corrupted by wealth and greed. Because Archidamia and Agesistrata were the wealthiest two people in all of Lacedaemon, Archidamia's support of Agis was instrumental in gaining support for the cause. She was among those who first pledged to contribute their wealth to a common pool, which was then to be distributed equally amongst both old and new Spartan citizens.
However, these revolutionary designs were foiled by the corruption of Agis's uncle and erstwhile supporter, Agesilaus, and the machinations of a rival party, led by the Agiad King, Leonidas II. Leonidas and the Ephors had Agis illegally imprisoned and executed, unbeknownst to a mob that had gathered out of concern and a possible desire to see him freed. Archidamia and Agesistrata were subsequently lured into the prison on the premise that they were to see Agis; and there they too both met their ends at the hands of their political rivals. Considering that she must have born her son Archidamus IV before 320 BC, at the time of her execution in 241 BC she was probably far in her nineties.
Other literature
Queen Archidamia has been referenced in other forms of literature. The references include the German work Die grossmüthige Spartanerin, oder, Archidamia by composer Johann Adolf Hasse. More recently Queen Archidamia was referenced in Professor Scott Romine's 'Belles and Poets; Intertextuality in the Civil War Diaries of White Southern Women'. According to Romine Kate Stone drew inspiration from the Queen's famous 'Are you worthy of the name' speech.

Coalition is a 2015 British television film about the formation of a coalition government following the 2010 United Kingdom general election. It was broadcast on Channel 4 on 28 March 2015, shortly before that year's general election. The film was written by James Graham and starred Bertie Carvel as Nick Clegg, Ian Grieve as Gordon Brown, and Mark Dexter as David Cameron. Graham wrote the film in the aim of giving humanity and enabling empathy to all of the figures portrayed within it, which earned it positive reviews from critics.
Plot
Nick Clegg is popular with the electorate ahead of the 2010 general election, with his Liberal Democrat party promising electoral reform and an end to the dominance of the two main parties, Labour and Conservative, who had led every British government in almost 90 years. The election results in a hung parliament with no party having a majority of seats: the Conservatives have the most, then the governing Labour, and then the Liberal Democrats. Nick is disappointed that his popularity did not reflect in the results, but is consoled by his party's former leader, Paddy Ashdown.
As the party with the most seats, the Conservatives led by David Cameron are given the first choice to form a government, which will either be a minority government or a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. Conservative peers are vehemently opposed to working with the Liberal Democrats due to what they see to be contrasting policies, but Shadow Chancellor George Osborne tells David that if they ally with them, it would put the Tories into a centrist position and potentially make them more electable for the next general election. Meanwhile, Labour, led by incumbent Prime Minister Gordon Brown, prepare for negotiations with the Liberal Democrats. Gordon points out to Nick that both parties are left-wing and progressive, but Nick is held back by the personal unpopularity of Brown amongst the British public.
Liberal Democrat MPs meet with their Conservative counterparts to negotiate a possible government, discussing the possibility of a referendum on electoral reform. Conservative peers are furious with Cameron on this proposal, stating that reform would end any future possibility of a Conservative majority government. However, he convinces them by saying that a Labour—Liberal Democrat coalition would pass electoral reform without a referendum, as both parties support it. In another meeting, Gordon tries to win over Nick by promising to resign during their first term in government, but Nick wants it sooner.
Gordon resigns for the good of his party and to leave in a dignified way, strategically forcing David Cameron into becoming Prime Minister in a minority government. Nick is adamant to form a coalition as he sees Labour as unpopular. His MPs are angry with the possibility of a coalition with the Conservatives, due to the opposition between the two parties. However, Paddy Ashdown makes a speech saying that this is the best opportunity for the party to enter government and execute their policies. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats form a coalition.
Cast
Production
The film was written by James Graham, who also scripted This House, a National Theatre play about the government of James Callaghan from 1976 to 1979. Graham chose to dramatise the formation of the government in 2010 because "The personalities, clashes, the farcical nature of some of it, the loss of dignity – it was characterful and weird. The lack of sleep, the pressure, and exhaustion make it exciting ... It's really important to me to try and humanise them". He stated that the message of the film was not to change political opinions, but to encourage empathy towards politicians because "There's this presumption that they're all corrupt and incompetent – but I'd love people to empathise with the incredible situation".
The film was sponsored by Japanese car manufacturer Lexus.
Reception
Kasia Delgado of Radio Times praised the film for managing "to make the most powerful men in the country seem both ridiculous, and entirely human", calling it "like The Thick of It on valium".
In the New Statesman, Anoosh Chakelian wrote that it "starts off as satire and ends as an opera. It is the young playwright's eye for detail and evident reams of source material that allow for such an astute commentary, and human portrayal", while also being "masterfully unbiased; the one clear lesson to the audience is that our politicians are humans". She singled out the best performance to be Gatiss as Mandelson, as the "darkly frivolous" performance "has the macabre silliness spot on".
Lucy Mangan of The Guardian stated that her opinion of the film was prejudiced by opinions on the politicians portrayed within it, but wrote that it gave a new image to them when "bloodless freaks began to swell with life and humanity".
When commenting on the actors, GQ writer Ian McGurk praised the range of the portrayal of Brown by Grieve but reserved highest praise for Mark Dexter as Cameron, citing Dexter's striking physical similarity to the real Cameron and adding that "He also gives the best performance".

The Guardian's Dave Simpson enthused that "this may well be Persson's best album", and called it "a major work, whatever it sells". Yahoo's Josh Rogan had special praise for producer Mark Linkous, concluding that "Linkous has crafted an album that complements Persson's songs and vision to great effect".

Abderrahmane Abdelli (born April 2, 1958) is a Berber author, composer, and singer songwriter known for mixing the traditional North African music of his homeland with modern sounds.
Biography
Abdelli was born in Mechta Behalil, a hamlet in the Great Kabylie, Algeria, during the Algerian War of Independence. His family was displaced by the bombing of their village, Kennour, part of the Tizi Ouzou Province, by the French airforce. After the war, Abdelli's family settled in the coastal town of Dellys. As a boy, Abdelli constructed his first guitar out of an empty oil can, a plank of wood and fishing line. After learning to play the guitar, Abdelli was introduced to the mandol by Chaabi master, Chaïd Moh-Esguir.
Abdelli made his musical debut in Dellys, Kabylie, during the 1974 Algerian Independence festival. He won several contests in Algeria for amateur singers. Abdelli produced his first album in 1984, but it saw little success. Two years later, he released an album that sold 12,000 copies, but never received payment from his record company Abdelli produced a couple of albums in Algeria, but moved to Belgium in 1984. It was there "he met producer Thierry Van Roy, who was so fascinated with Abdelli's music that he spent two years exploring the roots of the Berbers' musical tradition at the University of Algiers." Since 1986 he has made his home in Brussels, Belgium.
Abdelli's most popular albums are New Moon and Among Brothers He has performed at major festivals in Europe, including WOMAD and the 0110 concert in Ghent. In addition to Europe he has toured in England, the US and Canada.
Influences
Abdelli's music reflects a heavy Algerian influence. As stated by World Music Central:
Abdelli's lyrics express strong and poetic images of his culture which is threatened from all sides. He expresses himself essentially by symbols which are parts of his traditional culture. He tries to make known the ancient Berber culture which, by its tolerance and openness, is an example to follow in our troubled world.
Abdelli has collaborated with musicians from Europe and South America, often incorporating instruments such as the cajón (Peru), the tormento, the quena (Chilean), and the bandura (Ukrainian).

Bayshore (also known as Accora Village) is a neighbourhood in Bay Ward in the west end of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Prior to amalgamation in 2001, the neighbourhood was in the City of Nepean. It is bounded east by row houses off Bayshore Drive, to the north Carling Avenue, to the west Holly Acres Drive and the Lakeview neighbourhood, and to the south Ontario Highway 417. The main street in Bayshore is Woodridge Crescent, while the Bayshore Station is the major bus transit station.
According to the Canada 2016 Census, the neighbourhood had a population of 5,585. The neighbourhood is characterized by rental communities. The homes are townhouses (row houses), garden homes and high-rise apartment buildings.
Most of the population in the community features different ethnic groups. Most immigrants are from the Philippines (330), Iraq (315), and Afghanistan (205). The neighbourhood has a large Muslim population. The 2011 National Household Survey reported that 34% of the people in Bayshore's Census Tract were Muslim.
History
The community was first built in 1963-1965. The developer was the Minto Group which is a significant developer of rental and non-rental communities in Ottawa. In the 1970s and 1980s more townhouses and high-rises were built. In the early 2000s, the community changed ownership to Ferguslea Properties Inc, which is owned by Dan Greenberg. In 2011, Ferguslea announced that they would manage Accora Village, and all staff became employees of Ferguslea.
The main attraction is the Bayshore Shopping Centre which was built in 1973 and had two floors extended in 1987. Bayshore underwent a $270 million renovation, that included a new parking garage, updates to the mall, and the addition of several stores such as H&M, Victoria's Secret and Zara. Target was supposed to open a location in the mall, but plans were cancelled when Target pulled out of the country in 2015. This space is now occupied by Walmart.
In 2011, Ferguslea Properties Ltd, the owner of 2,465 units in the area, announced their plan to invest $40 million into the community. They also announced the community would be renamed Accora Village.
Accora Village
Accora Village is home to 2,465 units, with approximately 7,000 residents. The community features 10 high-rise apartment buildings, and a range of townhomes and garden homes. Accora Village also offers its residents a recreation centre, named the Accora Centre. The Accora Centre holds an indoor pool, a gymnasium, a weight room, a lounge, and party rooms. The community is undergoing renovations to revamp the buildings. Its first apartment building to undergo complete renovations is Cobalt, located at 90 Woodridge Crescent.
Accora Village was the 2013 recipient of the Crime-Free Multi-Housing Program's Rental Owner of the Year award, for its commitment to ensuring safety and security in the community.
Education
Within the bounds of the community there are two elementary schools. Bayshore Public School is an English Public elementary school providing Grade JK-6. The school's programs include a Regular English Program and an English as a Second Language program. Parent resources are available in Arabic, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Persian, Polish, Punjabi and Urdu.
St. Rose of Lima School (formerly Bayshore Catholic School) is a somewhat smaller English Catholic elementary school providing Grade JK-6 The school's programs include English, and French Immersion programs.
Recreation
For recreation, there is the Bayshore Community Centre, with an indoor gym and an indoor swimming pool. Bayshore Park features a baseball diamond and a few soccer fields. There is a National Capital Commission (NCC) bike path that goes along the western border of the neighborhood. The bike path goes to Kanata in the west and central Ottawa to the east.
In late 2013, Ferguslea Properties, the Senators Foundation, and the City of Ottawa announced their commitment to build the next rink of dreams, to be located in the middle of Accora Village, in Bayshore Park.
Entertainment
There is a movie theater owned by Cineplex Entertainment called "Cineplex Cinemas", previously called "the Coliseum" on Carling Avenue just outside the neighborhood. In that location there was once a drive-in movie theater and a 6-plex movie theatre called Britannia 6. In 1998 they were both demolished to make way for the Coliseum.

The Institute for Social and Economic Analyses (ISEA, ) is a Prague-based think tank established in 2002. Its members' research covers subjects related mainly to the recent social and economic transformation of the Czech Republic. These include education, competitiveness, public finance, pension system reform, income inequality, tax issues of research and development, political systems and political corruption.
The policy institute's motto is Diagnosis and Dialogue while the institute claims to strive to achieve a consensus among experts and the Czech political representation. The institute has been actively involved in lobbying the Czech Parliament regarding tax issues related to European Union funds available for research.
ISEA has obtained grants mainly from the Open Society Fund in Prague, the Czech government via the Czech Science Foundation and from other sources such as Konrad Adenauer Stiftung. The institute is associated with the Global Development Network. In 2007, the institute founder, sociologist Petr Matějů, was named a Fulbright New Century Scholar.

Okie is the third studio album by J. J. Cale, released in 1974.
Background
After having Eric Clapton take his composition "After Midnight" to the Top 20 in 1970, Cale scored another windfall when Lynyrd Skynyrd recorded "Call Me the Breeze" for their 1974 LP Second Helping. Although Cale would not have the success with his music that others would, the royalties from artists covering his songs would allow him to record and tour as it suited him. As he put it in 2013, "I knew if I became too well known, my life would change drastically. On the other hand, getting some money doesn't change things too much, except you no longer have to go to work."
Recording
Like his previous album Really, Okie was recorded in several different studios with producer Audie Ashworth. Okie is the first album where Cale layers his vocal tracks, something that would become one of the hallmarks of his sound. Cale later explained:
Musically, Okie covers a number of genres blended together in Cale's highly idiosyncratic sound, from the gospel standard "Precious Memories" to straight country on the Ray Price cover "I'll Be There If You Ever Want Me". "Any Way the Wind Blows" and "Cajun Moon" are examples of the sound Cale was establishing for himself, often referred to as the "Tulsa Sound", while the reggae-tinged opener "Crying" showed his willingness to explore new styles. The title track is the first of many instrumentals that would appear on future records, and according to the 2014 Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame bio on Cale, was recorded on the back porch of Cale's Tulsa home.
Okie contains some of Cale's most covered songs. In the same year of its release, Captain Beefheart recorded "I Got the Same Old Blues" (shortened to "Same Old Blues") for his Bluejeans & Moonbeams LP, one of the few covers to ever appear on a Beefheart album. The song would also be recorded by Eric Clapton, Bobby Bland, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Bryan Ferry. "Cajun Moon" was recorded by Herbie Mann on his 1976 album Surprises with vocals by Cissy Houston, by Poco on their album Cowboys & Englishmen, and by Randy Crawford on Naked and True (1995). In a 2013 interview Cale singled out jazz vocalist Crawford's version as his favorite rendition of the song, and he also listed this cover as one of his favorite takes of the other artists' of his songs. "Anyway the Wind Blows" was covered by Brother Phelps in 1995 and Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings in 1999, and Cale would re-record the song himself for his 2006 album with Clapton, The Road to Escondido. "I'd Like to Love You, Baby" was covered by Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers in 2003, appearing on their 2009 album, The Live Anthology.

WEBF (88.3 FM) is a K-LOVE-affiliated radio station in Lerose, Kentucky, United States. The station is owned by Hour of Harvest, Inc. and features programming from K-Love. The station is also broadcast on HD radio.
In 2006, Governor Ernie Fletcher honored the station with the Arts Broadcasting Award..
History
The station went on the air as WSPE on 8 January 1999, owned by the Owsley County Schools with studios at Owsley County High School. On 31 July 2001, the station changed its call sign to WOCS, and on 23 March 2011, the station changed its call sign again to the current WEBF.
From 2001 to 2011, then-WOCS served as a repeater for Morehead State University's NPR station, WMKY. However, in 2011, Owsley County Schools sold the station to Hour of Harvest, who then leased the station to K-LOVE.

The Science Mission Directorate (SMD) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) engages the United States' science community, sponsors scientific research, and develops and deploys satellites and probes in collaboration with NASA's partners around the world to answer fundamental questions requiring the view from and into space.
The Science Mission Directorate also sponsors research that both enables, and is enabled by, NASA's exploration activities. The SMD portfolio is contributing to NASA's achievement of the Vision for Space Exploration by striving to:
Understand the history of Mars and the formation of the solar system. By understanding the formation of diverse terrestrial planets (with atmospheres) in the solar system, researchers learn more about Earth's future and the most promising opportunities for habitation beyond our planet. For example, differences in the impacts of collisional processes on Earth, the Moon, and Mars can provide clues about differences in origin and evolution of each of these bodies.
Search for Earth-like planets and habitable environments around other stars. SMD pursues multiple research strategies with the goal of developing effective astronomically-detectable signatures of biological processes. The study of the Earth-Sun system may help researchers identify atmospheric biosignatures that distinguish Earth-like (and potentially habitable) planets around nearby stars. An understanding of the origin of life and the time evolution of the atmosphere on Earth may reveal likely signatures of life on extrasolar planets.
Explore the solar system for scientific purposes while supporting safe robotic and human exploration of space. For example, large-scale coronal mass ejections from the Sun can cause potentially lethal consequences for improperly shielded human flight systems, as well as some types of robotic systems. SMD's pursuit of interdisciplinary scientific research focus areas will help predict potentially harmful conditions in space and protect NASA's robotic and human explorers.
Leadership
Thomas Zurbuchen is the Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate beginning October 3, 2016. Recent Associate Administrators for the SMD include Edward J. Weiler (1998–2004, 2008–2011), Mary L. Cleave (2004–2005), Alan Stern (2007–2008) and John M. Grunsfeld (2012–2016). Stern resigned 25 March 2008, to be effective 11 April, over disagreements with Administrator Michael D. Griffin.

David Michaels (born October 11, 1954) is an American epidemiologist and professor in the Departments of Environmental and Occupational Health and Epidemiology at the Milken Institute School of Public Health of the George Washington University. He held high-level public health positions in the administrations of Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.
Education and early life
Michaels graduated from the City College of New York, and holds a Master in Public Health (MPH) and a PhD from Columbia University. Before joining the faculty of the George Washington University, he taught at the CUNY School of Medicine and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
Career
From 2009 to January 2017, Michaels served as the Assistant Secretary of Labor for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Nominated by President Barack Obama and unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Michaels served as OSHA's 12th Assistant Secretary, the longest serving administrator in OSHA's history.
As Assistant Secretary, Michaels issued new health standards protecting workers exposed to silica and beryllium, strengthened the agency's enforcement in high risk industries, expanded OSHA's whistleblower protection program, promoted common sense worker protection programs and standards, increased compliance assistance provided to small employers, and focused outreach on the vulnerable populations who are at greatest risk for work-related injury and illness. He also increased OSHA's capabilities in the areas of data analysis and program evaluation.
Michaels served as the United States Department of Energy's Assistant Secretary for Environment, Safety, and Health from 1998 through January 2001. In this position, he had primary responsibility for protecting the health and safety of workers, the neighboring communities and the environment surrounding the nation's nuclear weapons facilities. Michaels developed the initiative to compensate workers in the nuclear weapons complex who developed cancer or lung disease as a result of exposure to radiation, beryllium, silica, or other hazards. That initiative resulted in the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program, which has provided over $18 billion in benefits to sick workers and the families of deceased workers since its inception in 2001.
During the HIV/AIDS epidemic, Michaels developed a widely used mathematical model to estimate the number of children orphaned by the disease. In addition, while employed at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, NY, he helped found and directed the Epidemiology Unit at the Montefiore-Rikers Island Health Service, the first such unit at a jail in the United States.
Writings
Michaels has written extensively on issues related to the integrity of scientific information that serves as the basis of public health and environmental regulation. His studies and articles have been published in Science, JAMA, Scientific American, the International Journal of Epidemiology, the American Journal of Public Health and other scientific journals.
He is the author of The Triumph of Doubt: Dark Money and the Science of Deception (Oxford University Press, 2020). In her review in Science magazine, Sheril Kirshenbaum described the book as "a tour de force that examines how frequently, and easily, science has been manipulated to discredit expertise and accountability on issues ranging from obesity and concussions to opioids and climate change.” In Nature, Felicity Lawrence wrote that “The Triumph of Doubt is a brave and important book, raising the alarm about the systemic corruption of science.”
Michaels is also the author of Doubt is Their Product: How Industry's Assault on Science Threatens Your Health (Oxford University Press, 2008). In his review in Science magazine, Carl F. Cranor asks "Ever wonder why it has been so slow and difficult to reduce the health risks from tobacco, secondhand smoke, lead, beryllium, or chromium? David Michaels's excellent Doubt Is Their Product provides part of the explanation, showing numerous ways in which “the product defense industry” uses scientific (and pseudoscientific) arguments to undermine public health protections, corrupt the scientific record, and mislead the public."
Awards
In February 2006, Michaels was awarded the American Association for the Advancement of Science's Award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility. He has also received the American Public Health Association's David P. Rall Award for Advocacy in Public Health, the 2009 John P. McGovern Science and Society Award of Sigma Xi, the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH®) William D. Wagner Award and the US Department of Energy's Meritorious Service Award.
Personal life
Michaels lives in the Washington DC area with his wife Gail Dratch. He has two children, Joel Michaels and Lila Michaels. He is the son of photojournalist Ruth Gruber, step-brother of writer and activist Barbara Seaman, and cousin of science writer Dava Sobel.

Manhattan Tower is a 1932 American pre-Code film directed by Frank R. Strayer starring Mary Brian and James Hall.
Plot
Mary Harper and Jimmy Duncan both work at the Empire State Building, he as an engineer, she as a secretary. They would like to marry and buy a house that they saw advertised in a window in the building lobby, but they need more money.
Mary asks her womanizing boss for advice, and he persuades her to give him all her savings to invest. Unbeknownst to her, the boss has speculated in the commodity market, and lost not only his money and that of his wealthy wife, but also some of the firm's funds too. His wife would like to quietly divorce him to marry her politician friend, but the husband asks her for money to avoid a scandal. When Mary changes her mind and asks for the return of her savings, her boss refuses and mistreats her. That causes a confrontation between Jimmy and Mary's boss, and they fight. Meanwhile, the politician and an honest accountant of the firm, who discovered his superior's misdeeds but kept silent, fearing to lose his job, decide to confront Mary's boss. During the fight, he takes a gun from a drawer, and menaces them all. He trips and falls through a window to his death. The witnesses decide to declare it a suicide and go on with their lives.
There are other intertwining stories of people who work at the Empire State Building, and a bank run started by a casual comment by the politician's secretary.

The International Peace Gardens is a botanical garden located in Jordan Park in Salt Lake City, Utah.
Part of Utah's history, the garden was conceived in 1939 and dedicated in 1952. The International Peace Gardens has welcomed tens of thousands of travelers from every corner of the globe, including exchange partners from Salt Lake's several Sister Cities. The project was brought to fruition by Utah citizen Mrs. Otto (Ruey) Wiesley, working with the Salt Lake City Superintendent of Parks, the Mayor, and the Salt Lake Council of Women. Today, the garden remains under the direction of the Salt Lake Council of Women Past Presidents Council. Each participating Utah-based nation group is allotted a plot in which to create a garden with native plantings and garden architecture and statues of world peace leaders typical of the homeland and its culture. The Peace Gardens currently represents the cultural diversity of 28 gardens and encourages pleasant wandering and meditation by visitors.
Description and history
The purpose of the Salt Lake Council of Women is to take an active interest in community affairs and to promote whatever may contribute to the general welfare of the communities on the Wasatch Front.
The gardens comprise 11 acres and are located in Jordan Park along the banks of the Jordan River at 9th West and 10th South in Salt Lake. They symbolize the true spirit of democracy and world peace, brotherly love, history, literature, and cultural heritage of many lands.
The project was initiated in 1939 by Mrs. Otto Wiesley, Citizenship Chair, for good citizenship and to give foreign origin groups a specific part in the beautification of the city for the coming Centennial Celebration of 1947. It was presented to the City Commission and the Parks department and was given their approval and support.
The garden project was stopped before anything was planted because of the onset of World War II, but was resumed in 1947.
Each of the nationality groups is allotted a garden section which they design, create and plant at their own expense. Plans have to be approved by the City Parks Director before they are implemented. As each garden is completed, it is dedicated and presented to the city, who then assumes the permanent maintenance of the garden.
The United States became the first country represented in the gardens. Its section is the largest of the sections representing countries from the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Asia. The second section to be organized, planted, and dedicated was the Japanese garden. Others followed every year until there were 28 countries represented with others who would like to have a garden, but unfortunately space ran out. Land has opened up on the northwest side of the gardens across the river and has been deeded to the city by Union Pacific; some hope that the gardens will obtain use of it for purposes of expansion.
Sculptures include: A Monument to Peace: Our Hope for the Children, Bauta Stone, the bust of Mahatma Gandhi, The Little Mermaid, Irish Cross, Olmec Head Replica, Peace Cradle, Preaching Buddha, and Spirit Poles.

An abrasive saw, also known as a cut-off saw or chop saw, is a circular saw (a kind of power tool) which is typically used to cut hard materials, such as metals, tile, and concrete. The cutting action is performed by an abrasive disc, similar to a thin grinding wheel. Technically speaking this is not a saw, as it does not use regularly shaped edges (teeth) for cutting.
These saws are available in a number of configurations, including table top, free hand, and walk behind models. In the table top models, which are commonly used to cut tile and metal, the cutting wheel and motor are mounted on a pivoting arm attached to a fixed base plate. Table top saws are often electrically powered and generally have a built-in vise or other clamping arrangement. The free hand designs are typically used to cut concrete, asphalt, and pipe on construction sites. They are designed with the handles and motor near the operator, with the blade at the far end of the saw. Free hand saws do not feature a vise, because the materials being cut are larger and heavier. Walk-behind models, sometimes called flat saws are larger saws which use a stand or cart to cut into concrete floors as well as asphalt and concrete paving materials.
Abrasive saws typically use composite friction disk blades to abrasively cut through the steel. The disks are consumable items as they wear throughout the cut. The abrasive disks for these saws are typically in diameter and thick. Larger saws use diameter blades. Disks are available for steel and stainless steel. Abrasive saws can also use superabrasive (i.e., diamond and cubic boron nitride or CBN) blades, which last longer than conventional abrasive materials and do not generate as hazardous particulate matter. Superabrasive materials are more commonly used when cutting concrete, asphalt, and tile; however, they are also suitable for cutting ferrous metals.
Since their introduction, portable cut-off saws have made many building site jobs easier. With these saws, lightweight steel fabrication previously performed in workshops using stationary power bandsaws or cold saws can be done on-site. Abrasive saws have replaced more expensive and hazardous acetylene torches in many applications, such as cutting rebar. In addition, these saws allow construction workers to cut through concrete, asphalt, and pipe on job sites in a more precise manner than is possible with heavy equipment.

Agile marketing is an organizational effectiveness strategy that uses self-organizing, cross-functional teams doing work in frequent iterations. It aims to drive growth by focusing team efforts on those that deliver value to the end-customer. This emerging practice in marketing applies selected principles of agile software development. Proponents argue this increases speed, quality, flexibility, and effectiveness of a marketing department.
At a high-level, agile marketing may be described as a group of teams organizing around the question “How can we best deliver value to our customer?” Teams collaborate across an organization executing a set of high priority tasks over a recurring short (1-4 week) period - adapting direction, objectives, and processes as needed.
Principles
The core Agile Marketing principles are as follows.
This is more about responding to changes over following the plan.
Focus on working not only documentation
Focus more on Individuals not only process
Focus more on Customer collaboration not the Contract or negotiation
The famous frameworks for the Agile Marketing are Kanban board & Scrum (software development).

Robert Oswald Moon (17 March 1865 – 28 July 1953), was a British physician, writer and Liberal Party politician.
Background
He was born on 17 March 1865 in London, the youngest son of Robert Moon, a barrister. He was educated at Winchester School and New College, Oxford. His medical training was at Guy's Hospital. He married Ethel Waddington. They had one son and three daughters. Ethel died in 1933.
Medical career
In 1897 he became Surgeon to the Phil-Hellenic Legion in the Græco-Turkish War. In 1990 he was a Trooper in the Hampshire Yeomanry in South Africa. In 1901 he was a Civil Surgeon for the Field Force in South Africa. In 1909 he was a senior physician at the Western General Dispensary. He wrote a number of books on medical subjects. In 1915 he was Chadwick Lecturer on Typhus in Serbia. In 1917 he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps with the temporary rank of Major. He was a consulting physician to the Royal Waterloo Hospital and senior physician to the National Hospital for Diseases of the Heart. He became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1909.
Political career
In November 1909 he was adopted Liberal candidate for the Marylebone East Division of London for the January 1910 General Election. This was a seat that had always voted in a Conservative since it was created in 1885.
He was a Liberal candidate again for Marylebone East at the December 1910 General Election.
He did not contest the 1918 General Election. He was a Liberal candidate for the Wimbledon Division of Surrey at the 1922 General Election. This was another Unionist seat that they had won at every election since it was created in 1885.
He did not contest the 1923 General Election. He was selected at the eleventh hour as Liberal candidate for the Oxford Division of Oxfordshire for the 1924 General Election. This seat was a better prospect for a Liberal as the party had won the seat in 1922 and 1923 before losing it in a by-election early in 1924 back to the Unionists. In a difficulty election campaign for the Liberal party, he was able to do little more than retain second place;
He was a Liberal candidate again for Oxford at the 1929 General Election. With the Liberal party experiencing a mini-revival nationally he was unable to make this tell in Oxford and finished second again;
He did not stand for parliament again.
Family
Moon married in 1901 Ethel Rose Grant Waddington, daughter of Major-General Thomas Waddington. They had a son, Penderel Moon, and four daughters.

Just for Laughs () is a comedy festival held each July in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Founded in 1983, it is the largest international comedy festival in the world. It also serves as a television division.
History
Just for Laughs was formed in 1983 as a two-day French-language event. In 1985, Andy Nulman joined the festival's staff and introduced English-language events as well; under Nulman's stewardship, the festival increased to a full month, with French-speaking performers during the first half, and English speakers in the second half. International and non-verbal acts (acrobats, pantomimes, etc.) are scattered throughout the program.
In 1999, Nulman left the festival's full-time employ; however, he directed its major Gala Shows at the Saint-Denis Theatre every July, and remained on the board of directors of the festival's parent company. After an 11-year absence, Nulman returned to Just for Laughs in July 2010 as president of Festivals and Television.
Each day, performers, "New Vaudevillians" and other acts both vocal and visual perform throughout the city, particularly in the "Latin Quarter"—an area known for its theatres, cafés and boutique shopping. In the evenings, the nightclubs and live venue theatres offer special programs supporting the performers.
Although Just For Laughs attracts spectators from around the world, many of those in the audience are talent scouts, booking agents, producers, and managers from the entertainment industry. Performing at the festival is one of the biggest opportunities for undiscovered talent to showcase their act in front of industry professionals.
The Just For Laughs festival also has the Comedia comedy film festival component, which started in 1996. It gives awards for feature and short films. In 2005, Comedia screened 125 short films from around the world as well as several feature-length films.
In February 1994, the festival sponsored a splinter project in Hollywood, Florida. That coastal area is a favourite winter destination for Quebecers who head south to vacation in the warmer weather. The event, Juste Pour Rire—En Vacances (Just For Laughs—On Vacation), was held in the Young Circle Park, an outdoor venue with an urban park setting.
In July 2007, Just For Laughs celebrated its 25th edition, launching a festival in Toronto, Ontario.
In 2009, a U.S. edition of the festival was held in Chicago, sponsored by U.S. cable network TBS.
On November 24, 2010, it was announced that they have to move the Just for Laughs galas to Place des Arts and that the 2011 festival in the Saint-Denis Theatre would be recycled due to budget cuts.
In July 2016, Just For Laughs London was held at Russell Square.
On April 1, 2019, Just For Laughs name went fully stylized to Just for laughs. On April 3, 2020, it was announced that the 2020 edition of Just For Laughs would be postponed until the fall due to the coronavirus pandemic. It was scheduled to run from September 29 to October 11, 2020, however, on July 21, 2020, organizers reversed their decision and cancelled the event. To fill the gap, they choose for a series of virtual performances that will run online (via the Internet only), for two days, on October 9 and 10, 2020.
Sale to ICM Partners, Bell and the Molson family
On October 18, 2017, festival president and founder Gilbert Rozon resigned from his position following allegations of sexual misconduct. Rozon later announced that he would sell the festival. As per a partnership with the conglomerate, Quebecor was given right of first refusal to counter competing offers. The company, however, declined. On March 21, 2018, it was announced that the entire company would be acquired by a partnership between U.S.-based talent agency ICM Partners and Ontario comedian Howie Mandel. In their announcement of the purchase, it was stated that Just for Laughs would remain based in Montreal (with Mandel considering the event to be a key component of local culture), and that there would be no changes in its management or operations. It was also stated that the partnership was seeking other local partners. Quebecor subsequently announced that it would become a "founding partner" of Le Grand Montréal Comédie Fest—a competing event (which lasted 2 years) that has been established by a group of Quebecois comedians as a competitor in the wake of the Rozon scandal.
In May 2018, La Presse reported that the partnership planned to sell a 51% stake in Just for Laughs to Bell Canada and Evenko (an event management company owned by the Montreal Canadiens' ownership group Groupe CH, in turn owned by the Molson family), so that the event would remain majority-owned by Canadian interests and remain eligible for government tax credits. On June 7, 2018, Just For Laughs confirmed that Bell Media and Groupe CH had acquired stakes in the festival.
In July of 2022, Just for Laughs announced a line-up of 62 comedians that will be featured in the Montreal festival that will run from July 13 to 31st. This festival also marks the 40th anniversary of Just for Laughs.
TV shows
Tapings from festival performances have been featured in Just for Laughs-branded television programs and specials, which have aired on channels such as CBC Television, Radio-Canada, The Comedy Network (including the original Just for Laughs series, as well as a new series that premiered in 2012, Just for Laughs: All Access), and TVA.
A UK series, also entitled Just for Laughs, aired on Channel 4 from 1987 to 1996.
Just For Laughs Australia screens on the Ten Network in Australia and features highlights from the festival with an emphasis on Australian comedy performers.
The festival has also lent its name to a hidden camera comedy series, Just for Laughs: Gags, which has also been aired by various Canadian channels, and has been sold internationally.
In 2018, Radio-Canada and The Comedy Network (now called CTV Comedy Channel) briefly dropped all Just for Laughs programming, apparently caused by Gilbert Rozon allegations of sexual misconduct. TVA continued to air Just for Laughs: Gags, but renamed Les Gags. CBC Television still air Just for Laughs: Gags with no changes. Following the festival's subsequent ownership changes, CTV Comedy and other Bell Media channels have resumed airing festival programming.
Mascot
Victor is the mascot and logo for the comedy festival Just for Laughs. It was designed by Vittorio Fiorucci of the Canadian Design Resource company.
The image was inspired by a monster that preys on Montreal. The logo can be seen across the world on posters, T-shirts, event site markers, costumes, and inflatables.
In 2005 the character was redesigned by animator Alan Best at the behest of advertising agency Cossette as part of a comprehensive graphic overhaul of the Just For Laughs brand.
In 2007, "Rose" was created, a character to be the wife of Victor.

The Rolls-Royce Falcon is an aero engine developed in 1915. It was a smaller version of the Rolls-Royce Eagle, a liquid-cooled V-12 of 867 cu in (14.2 L) capacity. Fitted to many British World War I-era aircraft, production ceased in 1927. The Falcon was designed by R.W. Harvey-Bailey.
An airworthy Falcon survives today and powers a Bristol F.2 Fighter during summer displays.
Design and development
Production of the Falcon began in September 1916 and was so successful that it was also manufactured under licence by Brazil Straker in Bristol. Production continued until 1927, by which time 2,185 had been built.
An unusual feature of this engine was the epicyclic propeller reduction gear which contained a clutch designed to limit the maximum torque, thus protecting the reduction gears.
The Falcon was notably used in the Bristol F.2 Fighter and Blackburn Kangaroo bomber.
Variants
Note:
Falcon I (Rolls-Royce 190 hp Mk I)
(1916-17), 230 hp, 250 engines produced in both left- and right-hand tractor versions.
Falcon II (Rolls-Royce 190 hp Mk II)

The genus Annwoodia was named in 2017 to circumscribe an organism previously described as a member of the genus Thiobacillus, Thiobacillus aquaesulis - the type and only species is Annwoodia aquaesulis, which was isolated from the geothermal waters of the Roman Baths in the city of Bath in the United Kingdom by Ann P. Wood and Donovan P. Kelly of the University of Warwick - the genus was subsequently named to honour Wood's contribution to microbiology. The genus falls within the family Thiobacillaceae along with Thiobacillus and Sulfuritortus, both of which comprise autotrophic organisms dependent on thiosulfate, other sulfur oxyanions and sulfide as electron donors for chemolithoheterotrophic growth. Whilst Annwoodia spp. and Sulfuritortus spp. are thermophilic, Thiobacillus spp. are mesophilic.
A. aquaesulis is moderately thermophilic with an optimum temperature of 43 °C and a temperature range of 30 °C to 55 °C - a similar temperature profile to the related genus Sulfuritortus - and is a facultative chemolithoautotroph that grows on reduced sulfur oxyanions such as thiosulfate as the electron donor and carbon dioxide or bicarbonate as the carbon source. Unlike Thiobacillus spp., Annwoodia spp. do not produce tetrathionate during growth on thiosulfate and can also grow heterotrophically on nutrient broth. Elementary sulfur is deposited by the organism in batch culture with thiosulfate as the electron donor, but not in chemostat culture. A. aquaesulis can use nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor, as well as molecular oxygen. The dominant respiratory quinone is ubiquinone-8 and the G+C fraction of the type strain of the type species is 67.5 mol%. All members of the genus produce volutin (polyphosphate) granules but not capsules or endospores. A. aquaesulis has a pH optimum of 7.5-8.0 and pH range of 7.0 to 9.0. Whilst nutrient broth and yeast extract will support heterotrophic growth, simple carbon compounds and ions such as sugars, organic acids, formate and monomethylamine do not support growth. Ammonium is the only source of nitrogen.
Annwoodia aquaesulis strains have been detected in mixed-population packed-bed reactors containing limestone as a source of carbon, elementary sulfur as the electron donor and nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor, as well as in karstic sulfidic thermal groundwater ecosystems of broad similarity to those from which the type strain was isolated
Annwoodia aquaesulis grown on thiosulfate, tetrathionate or trithionate has high growth yields, which are broadly similar to those of Thermithiobacillus spp., and are higher than members of the closely related genus Thiobacillus, indicating core metabolic differences. This high yield was observed in spite of 70% more carbon dioxide being fixed than could be accounted for as biomass, indicating the excretion of a carbon intermediate, which is not observed in Thermithiobacillus tepidarius, which was isolated from the same location at the Roman Baths in Bath, also by enrichment culture on thiosulfate as the sole electron donor and molecular oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor.

Numerous people have been involved in the various aspects of making and distributing the series.
Critical reception
The Louise Log won two awards at the 2014 LA Web Festival, Outstanding Writing in a Comedy (Anne Flournoy), and Lead Actress (Christine Cook, Seasons 1 & 2).
The Louise Log was shortlisted for the 2013 Web Show Shorty Awards.
The Independent, in its annual review of 10 Filmmakers to Watch, included Anne Flournoy for The Louise Log, and published an interview with her.
Digital Chick TV described The Louise Log as "a hilarious on-going comedy that gets into a woman's mind. Literally.".
Good Day, Regular People said, "I very much relate to the heroine in this series, Louise. I do all the fumbling self doubt and second guessing of myself, as she does. My internal dialogue is much like hers--and to hear it voiced aloud, I laugh in recognition. And relief."
Funny Not Slutty said that The Louise Log is "a dark, funny, weird yet relatable web series about a woman, her life, her men, and her inner voice".

Nasr ad-Din Abu Abdallah Muhammad ibn Asad ad-Din Shirkuh (sometimes referred to as Nasr ad-Din ibn Shirkuh and al-Malik al-Qahir) was the Kurdish Ayyubid emir of Homs from 1179 to 1186.
Accession
The Zangid Sultan Nur ad-Din Zengi had given the domain of Homs to Shirkuh in 1164. Five years later, on Shirkuh's death, Nur ad-Din took the city back, but following his victory at the Horns of Hama in 1175, Saladin gave the domain of Homs to his son Muhammad ibn Shirkuh. He also gave him Palmyra and ar-Rahba. Saladin thought so highly of Muhammad ibn Shirkuh that in 1185 (581) he planned to give him the major strategic domain of Mosul in northern Iraq. However, the campaign to take the city from the Zengids was not successful, and he had to withdraw his forces, so Muhammad ibn Shirkuh received nothing.
Family
Muhammad ibn Shirkuh married a sister of Saladin, who was thus his own first cousin, known as Sitt Ash-Sham (‘The Lady of Syria', i.e. not her given name). Her full name was Sitt Ash-Sham Zumurrud Khatun bint Najm d-Din Ayyub. When she married Muhammad ibn Shirkuh she was the widow of one of Saladin's military commanders named Lajin, by whom he had a son named Husan ad-Din Umar b. Lajin. Sitt Ash-Sham was famous for the scale and generosity of her charitable works. It is not clear whether she was or was not the mother of his heir Al-Mujahid, but it is generally assumed that she was not.
Death
Saladin fell ill while laying siege to Mosul in 1185 and was obliged to retreat back into Syria. As he began making arrangements for his succession, Muhammad ibn Shirkuh saw an opportunity to expand his domains. He hurried away to Homs and made arrangements with certain notables in Damascus for them to surrender their city to him in the event of Saladin's death.
Before any of his plans could be put into effect, however, Muhammad ibn Shirkuh died suddenly in Homs on 4 March 1186 (10 Dhu'l Hijja 581). The cause of his death was apparently excessive drinking. He was succeeded in Homs by his thirteen-year-old son Al Malik Al-Mujahid Asad ad-Din Shirkuh II. Widowed a second time, his wife Sitt ash-Sham outlived him by more than thirty years and died in 1220 (616) in Damascus.

One Nation was an Australian Government program of infrastructure development carried out under the Keating Government from 1991 to 1996. Much of the program was implemented as a means of stimulating the economy in the aftermath of the early 1990s recession.
Elements
Key elements of the One Nation program included:
the Melbourne-Adelaide railway line was converted to standard gauge in 1995.
the 1067mm gauge Fisherman Islands railway line to the Port of Brisbane was converted to dual 1435/1067 mm gauge and extended in parallel with the duplicated passenger line to Dutton Park in 1997.
a standard gauge link was built to the port at Fremantle, Western Australia.
new standard gauge sidings were provided at Adelaide Outer Harbor.
a separate freight line was built between Macarthur and Glenfield as the first stage of what is now known as the Southern Sydney Freight Line. Its planned extension to the Chullora - Enfield freight line near Sefton was completed in 2013 by the Australian Rail Track Corporation with funds provided by the Australian Government under AusLink.
the Sydney-Brisbane railway line was upgraded with longer passing loops, the replacement of wooden trestles with concrete bridges, concrete resleepering, some minor deviations and bank stabilisation.
passing loops were extended on the North East railway line between Wodonga and Melbourne.
overhead clearances on the Adelaide-Perth railway were increased to allow for the transit of double-stacked containers.

Michael Lindqvist (born 12 December 1994) is a Swedish professional ice hockey forward for Färjestad BK of the Swedish Hockey League (SHL).
Playing career
Lindqvist made his Elitserien debut playing with AIK during the 2012–13 Elitserien season.
Having played seven seasons within the AIK organization and with the club continuing in the Allsvenskan, Lindqvist left the club and signed a contract to return to the SHL with Färjestad BK on 31 March 2017. In the following 2017–18 season, Lindqvist led the club in points per game and established new career highs with 20 goals and 34 points in just 33 games.

Rockhampton War Memorial is a heritage-listed memorial in the Rockhampton Botanic Gardens at Penlington Street, The Range, Rockhampton, Rockhampton Region, Queensland, Australia. It was built in 1924. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.
History
The Rockhampton War Memorial was unveiled on 16 October 1924 by the Governor of Queensland Sir Matthew Nathan. It was designed by architects Hockings and Palmer and produced by monumental masons, F M Allen. The granite memorial honours those who served in the First World War.
A public meeting was held in February 1919, when it was decided to erect a memorial to those who served in the First World War. It was to be a regional monument, representing surrounding districts, but erected in Rockhampton. In 1921, a site was selected on the riverbank and a national design competition was announced by the newly formed Central Queensland War Memorial Committee. This however, was not successful as most designs were too costly.
In 1922, the committee commissioned Rockhampton architects, Hockings and Palmer to present a design for a memorial to be situated in the Rockhampton Botanic Gardens. Their design, at a cost of £2,654 was accepted and Rockhampton masons, F M Allen were contracted to complete the work.
The firm of Hockings and Palmer was a partnership between Edwin Morton Hockings and Leslie Tarween Palmer.
Edwin (Ted) Hockings was the son of Albert John Hockings, one of Brisbane's best known citizens the mayor in 1865 and 1867. Edwin Hockings was articled to Richard Gailey and, while working there, won a competition for the design of Rockhampton Girls Grammar School. He moved to Rockhampton to become clerk of works for the project and remained there, opening his own practice in 1895. He was wounded whilst commanding a squadron of the Third Queensland Contingent in the Boer War and also served in the First World War.
Less is known about Palmer except that he was educated in Melbourne and employed by E A Scott and Green, Architects in Sydney. He worked alone for two years in Rockhampton before entering into partnership with Hockings in 1916. The partnership continued until 1938.
The area in which Rockhampton is located was first discovered by Ludwig Leichhardt and Thomas Mitchell between 1844 and 1846. The Fitzroy river was later discovered by the Archer brothers in 1853 and lead to the establishment and success of the region as a pastoral district. The initial development of the city itself was due to the discovery of gold at nearby Canoona in 1858.
The Rockhampton Botanic Gardens were established in 1869 when Mayor R M Hunter requested that the government turn the Native Police paddock into a reserve for botanic gardens. This was approved and the land was gazetted. However a working gardener was not appointed until 1873. The impetus for the gardens came from Frenchman Monsieur Anthelme Thozet who was among the first to re-establish substantial plantings in Rockhampton by planting trees from his private nursery along the river bank in Quay Street. The first appointed gardener was J S Edgar, partially trained by Thozet. His successor was R Simmons, a naturalist whose skills were frequently called upon by local and overseas scientists. In his capacity as curator of the gardens, Simmons laid out the grounds surrounding the memorial.
Australia, and Queensland in particular, had few civic monuments before the First World War. The memorials erected in its wake became our first national monuments, recording the devastating impact of the war on a young nation. Australia lost 60,000 from a population of about 4 million, representing one in five of those who served. No previous or subsequent war has made such an impact on the nation.
Even before the end of the war, memorials became a spontaneous and highly visible expression of national grief. To those who erected them, they were as sacred as grave sites, substitute graves for the Australians whose bodies lay in battlefield cemeteries in Europe and the Middle East. British policy decreed that the Empire war dead were to be buried where they fell. The word "cenotaph", commonly applied to war memorials at the time, literally means "empty tomb".
Australian war memorials are distinctive in that they commemorate not only the dead. Australians were proud that their first great national army, unlike other belligerent armies, was composed entirely of volunteers, men worthy of honour whether or not they paid the supreme sacrifice. Many memorials honour all who served from a locality, not just the dead, providing valuable evidence of community involvement in the war. Such evidence is not readily obtainable from military records, or from state or national listings, where names are categorised alphabetically or by military unit.
Australian war memorials are also valuable evidence of imperial and national loyalties, at the time, not seen as conflicting; the skills of local stonemasons, metalworkers and architects; and of popular taste. In Queensland, the soldier statue was the popular choice of memorial, whereas the obelisk predominated in the southern states, possibly a reflection of Queensland's larger working-class population and a lesser involvement of architects.
Many of the First World War monuments have been updated to record local involvement in later conflicts, and some have fallen victim to unsympathetic re-location and repair.
Although there were many different types of memorial were erected throughout Queensland, few were of the scale or cost of the Rockhampton one. Funds however, did not cover the cost of recording the soldiers names on the monument and it was proposed at the unveiling that a list of names would be kept at the Rockhampton Town Hall. This is one of the few memorials in Queensland without lists of names.
Description
The First World War Memorial is situated in the Botanic Gardens in Rockhampton.
It sits in the centre of a neat grass mound and is approached by a paved path from the south. The path surrounds grass mound, forming a circle which is reinforced by garden beds and evenly spaced Canary Island Date Palms (Phoenix canariensis), traditionally a symbol of victory. The grassed area is free of planting apart from a flower bed on the northern side in which herbaceous plants are pruned to form the word ANZAC surrounded by a border. A gun or war trophy is located in the centre of the approach path.
The memorial stands from the ground and is of Gracemere Grey granite. It comprises a plinth surmounted by a large obelisk.
The pedestal is located in the centre of a double stepped base which has rock faced vertical surfaces and smooth horizontal surfaces. The plinth is square in plan and is surmounted by the pedestal dado which is made up of three granite blocks. On the front face of the dado are the words IN REMEMBRANCE TO THOSE WHO FELL and the dates of the First World War and later conflicts. A polished granite plate has been bolted to the lower front face and also has dates of later conflicts. The northern side displays the word SACRIFICE on the top block.
The pedestal is surmounted by a tall obelisk which culminates in a pyramidal apex.

GPKism (typeset as GPKISM) was a gothic/industrial music group formed in 2007. It was originally the solo project of GPK (Gothique Prince Ken), while Kiwamu (of Blood) joined later that year. Both GPK and Kiwamu compose music for this project. They were featured in several publications including Cure Magazine and they have toured Australia, Japan, the United States, Europe and Central America.
History
GPKism was formed in January 2007 as the solo project of Australian musician GPK, and in September, guitarist Kiwamu of the Japanese goth band Blood joined the project, which was announced on the Internet Radio Show Tainted Reality. In January 2008, the same month that they released their first EP Sublimis, they were featured in Cure Magazine.
The band played their first live show on April 13, 2008 in Japan. In June they went on to play three shows in Australia, that were accompanied by in-store events.
Their first single, "Illuminatum," was released in September, 2008. This was followed a month later by their "Lament of the Fallen Star Tour" which included shows in Japan, Mexico, Costa Rica and in the United States at Nekocon. In December of that year, they played two live shows, opening for Suicide Ali. GPKism returned to Mexico and the United States to accompany Blood on their final tour.
GPKism's first full-length album, Atheos, was released on March 4, 2009 with the concept "Lament of a Fallen Angel". This was followed in March and April by a multi-city tour of Japan and Australia; their Australian tour also had Aural Vampire and DJ SiSeN performing. GPKism also toured Europe for the first time for their "Holy Blood" tour which included dates in Germany, Austria, Italy & Poland in May 2009.
On July 12 GPKism contributed a cover of RINK for the Blam Honey album Providence of Decadence and also performed alongside them at the Live Inn Rosa, Kiwamu and ex-BLOOD keyboardist RYO also helped arrange several tracks on the album.
The band released their EP Barathrum in August and a released a PV for it, gaining over 10,000 hits on YouTube under a month. This was the first release using the theme Countess Elizabeth Bathory. In September they toured South America and several of the Conventions there. After returning they released the EP Iudicium under the same theme.
In 2010 GPKism returned to the United States on tour with Seileen.
In late 2011 GPK returned to his own solo project Gothique Prince Ken while Kiwamu resumed activities with Blood.
They no longer appear to be active as a collaboration.

Xavier Romeu Matta is a counselor and litigator, with expertise in securities litigation and regulation, and corporate, commercial and employment litigation. He is a former politician, and an advocate of statehood for Puerto Rico, and of the appointment of Puerto Rican-Americans to the federal bench, most notably of current Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayor, whom he served as a law clerk.
Biography
Mr. Romeu was born and raised in Puerto Rico where his family resided since 1813. Following graduation from the Academia del Perpetuo Socorro in Miramar, he attended Haverford College in Pennsylvania, where he was Secretary, Vice President and President of the Student Council.
As a student leader, Mr. Romeu pushed and obtained the approval by the Board of Directors of funding of a new student center (currently, the John C. Whitehead student center). He also led in the fight for weight room/ sport facilities and for funding of Skeeters, the student-run pizza business. He was a strong supporter of self-governing by students and actively opposed the college administration on a proposed campus-wide alcohol ban. He successfully advocated for accountability and individual responsibility for social events on campus. Mr. Romeu was graduated with Honors in Philosophy.
He lives and works in New York and is married, has a daughter, and continues to strongly advocate on Puerto Rican matters, and for equality for the U.S citizens of the Territory of Puerto Rico.
In May 2010 he was invited to testify before the White House Taskforce on Puerto Rico on the subject of economic development strategies for the island and the inextricable relationship between economic development and status. Mr. Romeu explained that the island's colonial status has served as fertile ground for federal tax subsidies to the pharmaceutical and manufacturing industry for revenues realized, and patents held, in the U.S. Territory, but that the exceptions no longer increase job creation. Mr. Romeu advocated extension of a wage and job based tax credit, instead of revenue based corporate tax subsidy, and extension of empowerment zone status to all of Puerto Rico.
Public office
Xavier Romeu chaired the HNBA Governmental Affairs Committee. In that capacity, in 1998, he led the national coalition that broke the Republican Senate's hold on Judge Sonia Sotomayor's nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit

Gar Mandaran (গড় মান্দারন) is a village and a gram panchayat in the Goghat II CD block in the Arambag subdivision of the Hooghly district in the state of West Bengal, India.
Overview
The ruins of a fort at Gar Mandaran provided the setting for Bankim Chandra Chatterjee's novel Durgeshnandini.
Durgeshnandini is a romantic novel, based partly on history and partly on hearsay. The story centres around the attack and occupation of Gar Mandaran stronghold of Raja Birendra Singh, linked to the Bishnupur Raj, by the Pathans who were then entrenched in Odisha. The Mughal general Man Singh's son, Jagat Singh, was despatched to keep the Pathans at bay. Jagat Singh fell in love with Tilottama, the beautiful daughter of Raja Birendra Singh. The Pathans captured the fort, killed Raja Birendra Singh and held Jagat Singh and Tilottama, but a fatal attack on the Pathan general Kotlu Khan, turned things around.
Durgeshnandini, published in 1865, took the literary world by storm and was considered an epoch-making novel. It went through 13 editions during Bankim Chandra's life-time.
Geography

The fort of Mandaran was under the control of Gajapati Kapilendra Deva of Odisha but was lost to Bengal Sultan later. The ruler of the then Bengal, Hussain Saha was surrounded by forces of Gajapati Prataprudra Deva in this fort when he was chased down by Odia forces just after his raid into Odisha.When the frontiers of Bengal were expanded during Mughal rule, there were three prominent administrative zones in the Saptagram area – Sirkar Satgaon, Sirkar Selimabad and Sirkar Mandaran. The tomb of warrior Shah Ismail Ghazi is situated in the mound of Gar Mandaran.

Barnham railway station is a former station in Barnham, Suffolk on a now closed line between Thetford and Bury St Edmunds. It was located close to the Norfolk border.
History
The railway line between Bury St Edmunds and Thetford was proposed by the Bury St Edmunds and Thetford Railway (B&TR) and authorised on 5 July 1865; but the company had problems in raising the necessary money. After assistance was given by the Thetford and Watton Railway (T&WR), the plan was modified, and instead of running to the main station at , a curve was built so that T&WR trains from could run directly to the Bury St Edmunds line without reversing at Thetford. The B&TR line between and was opened on 1 March 1876. The B&TR was purchased by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) in 1878.
Trains on the B&TR were operated by the T&WR until 1879, when operation was taken over by the GER; after this, trains from Bury began to run to Thetford; the east to south curve at Thetford Bridge was not used after 1880. Thetford Bridge was then the last station before .

Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones is the sixth official compilation album by The Rolling Stones. It was initially released worldwide, except in the US, in 1993. The American release came on 24 August 2004.
It was the first Rolling Stones compilation packaged in the compact disc era, and covered the band's career from 1971's Sticky Fingers to then-most recent studio album Steel Wheels in 1989. It was also the band's first release under their contract with Virgin Records, which had been signed in November 1993, while Voodoo Lounge was being recorded. The album reached No. 16 in the UK and became an enduring seller. Despite its very belated release in the US in 2004, it managed to peak at No. 30 and go platinum.
The album artwork was designed by Bill Smith with an inner sleeve collage designed by Len Peltier.
In 2009 it was remastered and reissued by Universal Music, with the album version of "Miss You" being included in place of the single version.

Hebrew literature consists of ancient, medieval, and modern writings in the Hebrew language. It is one of the primary forms of Jewish literature, though there have been cases of literature written in Hebrew by non-Jews. Hebrew literature was produced in many different parts of the world throughout the medieval and modern eras, while contemporary Hebrew literature is largely Israeli literature.
In 1966, Agnon won the Nobel Prize for Literature for novels and short stories that employ a unique blend of biblical, Talmudic and modern Hebrew, making him the first Hebrew writer to receive this award.
Ancient era
Literature in Hebrew begins with the oral literature of the (), "The Holy Language", since ancient times and with the teachings of Abraham, the first of the biblical patriarchs of Israel, c. 2000 BCE . Beyond comparison, the most important work of ancient Hebrew literature is the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh).
The Mishna, compiled around 200 CE, is the primary rabbinic codification of laws as derived from the Torah. It was written in Mishnaic Hebrew, but the major commentary on it, the Gemara, was largely written in Aramaic. Many works of classical midrash were written in Hebrew.
Medieval era
During the medieval period, the majority of Jewish and Hebrew literature was composed in Islamic North Africa, Spain, Palestine, and the Middle East. Many works of medieval philosophical literature such as Maimonides' Guide to the Perplexed and The Kuzari, as well as many works of fiction, were written in Judeo-Arabic. Works of rabbinic literature were more often written in Hebrew, including: Torah commentaries by Abraham ibn Ezra, Rashi and others; codifications of Jewish law, such as Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, the Arba'ah Turim, and the Shulchan Aruch; and works of Musar literature (didactic ethical literature) such as Bahya ibn Paquda's Chovot ha-Levavot (The Duties of the Heart). One work of fiction which was written in Hebrew was the "Fox Fables" by Berechiah ben Natronai ha-Nakdan, Hebrew fables which resemble Aesop's fables.
Much medieval Jewish poetry was written in Hebrew, including liturgical piyyutim in Palestine in the seventh and eighth centuries by Yose ben Yose, Yanai, and Eleazar Kalir. These poems were added to the Hebrew-language liturgy. This liturgy was compiled in book form as "the siddur" by rabbis including Amram Gaon and Saadia Gaon. Later Spanish, Provençal, and Italian poets wrote both religious and secular poems; particularly prominent poets were Solomon ibn Gabirol, Yehuda Halevi, and Yehuda al-Harizi. Most were also active in translating Jewish rabbinic and secular literature from Arabic into Hebrew.
Only one Hebrew poem by a woman is attested for the medieval period (and is both the first and the last for some centuries): composed by the wife of Dunash ben Labrat, it laments Dunash's departure into exile.
Modern era
In addition to writing traditional rabbinic literature in Hebrew, modern Jews developed new forms of fiction, poetry, and essay-writing, which are typically called "Modern Hebrew Literature."
18th century
By the early eighteenth century, Jewish literature was still dominated by Sephardic authors, often writing in Judeo-Arabic. Moses Hayyim Luzzatto's allegorical drama "La-Yesharim Tehillah" (1743) may be regarded as the first product of modern Hebrew literature. It has been referred to as "a poem that in its classic perfection of style is second only to the Bible." Luzzatto's pupil in Amsterdam, David Franco Mendes (1713–92), in his imitations of Jean Racine ("Gemul 'Atalyah") and of Metastasio ("Yehudit"), continued his master's work, though his works are not as respected as were Luzzatto's.
Later in the eighteenth century, the Haskalah (Jewish enlightenment) movement worked to achieve political emancipation for Jews in Europe, and European Jews gradually began to produce more literature in the mould of earlier Middle Eastern Jewish authors. Moses Mendelssohn's translation of the Hebrew Bible into German inspired interest in the Hebrew language that led to the founding of a quarterly review written in Hebrew. Other periodicals followed. Poetry by Naphtali Hirz Wessely such as "Shire Tif'eret," or "Mosiade," made Wessely, so to speak, poet laureate of the period.
19th century
In nineteenth-century Galicia, poets, scholars, and popular writers who contributed to the dissemination of Hebrew and to the emancipation of the Jews of Galicia included:
Joseph Perl (1773–1839), writer and educator who, in 1819, published Revealer of Secrets, the first Hebrew novel.
Nachman Krochmal (1785–1840), a philosopher, theologian, and historian.
Solomon Judah Loeb Rapoport (1790–1867), a rabbi, poet, and biographer
Isaac Erter (1792–1841), a satirical poet whose collection of essays, "Ha-Tzofeh le-Bet Yisrael," is one of the purest works of modern Hebrew literature, attacking Hasidic superstitions and prejudices in a vigorous and classical style.
Meir Halevy Letteris (1800–1871), a lyric poet also known for his adaption of Goethe's Faust into Hebrew.
In Amsterdam, a circle of Hebrew-language literary artists emerged in the nineteenth century, including the poet Samuel Molder (1789–1862).
Prague became an active center for the Haskalah in the nineteenth century, and the best known among the Haskalah writers there was Jehudah Loeb Jeiteles (1773–1838), author of witty epigrams ("Bene ha-Ne'urim") and of works directed against Hasidism and against superstition.
In Hungary, Hebrew-language authors included Solomon Lewison of Moor (1789–1822), author of "Melitzat Yeshurun"; Gabriel Südfeld, a poet who was the father of Max Nordau; and the poet Simon Bacher. A notable Jewish author in Romania during the nineteenth century was the physician and writer Julius Barasch.
Italian Jews of the nineteenth-century who wrote in Hebrew included I. S. Reggio (1784–1854), Joseph Almanzi, Hayyim Salomon, Samuel Vita Lolli (1788–1843). Another figure of note was Rachel Morpurgo (1790–1860), who was one of the few female writers in the Haskalah movement, and whose poems have been described as characterized by "religious piety and a mystic faith in Israel's future." The best known Italian writer was Samuel David Luzzatto (1800–65) was the first modern writer to introduce religious romanticism into Hebrew and to attack northern rationalism in the name of religious and national feeling.
Prominent Hebrew writers in the Russian empire in the nineteenth century included:
the poet and mathematician Jacob Eichenbaum (1796–1861)
the Haskalah leader Isaac Baer Levinsohn
Kalman Schulman (1826–1900), who introduced the romantic form into Hebrew
the romantic poet Micah Joseph Lebensohn (1828–52)
the Lithuanian author Mordecai Aaron Ginzburg, known as "the father of prose"
Lithuanian poet Abraham Baer Lebensohn, known as the "father of poetry," whose poems "Shire Sefat Kodesh" were extraordinarily successful.
Abraham Mapu (1808–67), the creator of the Hebrew novel, whose historical romance "Ahabat Tziyyon" exercised an important influence on the development of Hebrew.
The poet Judah Leib Gordon, also known as "Leon Gordon" (1831–1892), was a well-known satirical poet who has been characterized as "an implacable enemy of the Rabbis."
20th century
As Zionist settlement in Palestine intensified at the start of the twentieth century, Hebrew became the shared language of the various Jewish immigrant communities along with native Palestinian Jews of the Old Yishuv, who continued the literary traditions of earlier Sephardic and Arab-Jewish writers such as Maimonedes (Moshe ibn Maimoun) and al-Harizi. Eliezer Ben-Yehuda in particular worked to adapt Hebrew to the needs of the modern world, turning to Hebrew sources from all periods and locales to develop a language that went beyond the sacred and poetic and was capable of articulating the modern experience.
With the rise of the Zionist movement amongst Jews in Europe, Ashkenazi Jews embraced Hebrew literature and began to dominate it for the first time. The foundations of modern Israeli writing were laid by a group of literary pioneers from the Second Aliyah including Shmuel Yosef Agnon, Moshe Smilansky, Yosef Haim Brenner, David Shimoni and Jacob Fichman. Hayim Nahman Bialik (1873–1934) was one of the pioneers of modern Hebrew poets and came to be recognized as Israel's national poet. Bialik contributed significantly to the revival of the Hebrew language, which before his days existed primarily as an ancient, scholarly, or poetic tongue. Bialik, like other great literary figures from the early part of the 20th century such as Ahad Ha-Am and Tchernichovsky, spent his last years in Tel Aviv, and exerted a great influence on younger Hebrew writers; the impact of his work is evident throughout modern Hebrew literature.
In parallel, a number of Palestinian and Levantine Jewish writers were influenced by the resurgence of Hebrew literature, and adopted Hebrew for their writings. In contrast to the experiences of pioneers such as Bialik, who were Ashkenazi immigrants from Europe, the Levantine Jewish writers were educated in Arabic literary traditions, and thus they incorporated many Arabic, Sephardic, and vernacular Palestinian themes and linguistic elements in their writing. Novelist Yehuda Burla, born in Jerusalem in 1886, served in the Ottoman army, and later taught Hebrew and Arabic in Damascus. In 1961, he was awarded the Israel Prize, for literature. The novelist Yitzhaq Shami was a Palestinian Jewish native of Hebron, and his work—which was written from the perspective of both Arabic-speaking Jews and Muslim Palestinians—incorporated diverse Arabic, Sephardic, and Middle Eastern themes. Shami holds a relatively unique place in Hebrew literature, since his writing is also recognized as Palestinian literature; in 2004 Shami was recognized by the Palestinian Academic Society as one of the important Palestinian writers.
In 1966, Agnon won the Nobel Prize for Literature for novels and short stories that employ a unique blend of biblical, Talmudic and modern Hebrew. Literary translators into Modern Hebrew, most notably Leah Goldberg among others, also contributed a great deal to Israeli-Hebrew literature through bringing international literature and literary figures into Hebrew circles through translation. Goldberg herself was also noted for being a prolific writer and pioneer of Israeli children's literature as well.
Contemporary era
A new generation of Hebrew writers emerged with the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. This new generation included the novelists Aharon Megged, Nathan Shaham, and Moshe Shamir, and the poets Yehudah Amichai, Amir Gilboa, and Haim Gouri. The novels My Michael (1968) and Black Box (1987) by Amos Oz and The Lover (1977) and Mr. Mani (1990) by A. B. Yehoshua describe life in the new state. These works also explore topics such as the conflict between parents and children and the rejection of some once-sacred ideals of Judaism and Zionism. Many Hebrew writers in the late twentieth century dealt with the Holocaust, women's issues, and the conflict between Israelis and Arabs. Another topic was the tension between Jews of European origin, the Ashkenazim, and Jews of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean origin, the Mizrahim and Sephardim. In 1986, the Palestinian-Israeli author Anton Shammas published the Hebrew novel "Arabesques", marking a milestone with the first major work of Hebrew literature written by a non-Jewish Israeli. Shammas's novel has been translated into a number of foreign languages.
Modern Hebrew authors include Ruth Almog, Aharon Appelfeld, David Grossman, Amalia Kahana-Carmon, Etgar Keret, Savyon Liebrecht, Sami Michael, Yaakov Shabtai, Meir Shalev, and Zeruya Shalev. Contemporary Israeli authors whose works have been translated into other languages and attained international recognition are Ephraim Kishon, Yaakov Shabtai, A. B. Yehoshua, Amos Oz, Irit Linur, Etgar Keret and Yehoshua Sobol. Hebrew poets include David Avidan, Maya Bejerano, Erez Biton, Dan Pagis, Dalia Ravikovitch, Ronny Someck, Meir Wieseltier, and Yona Wallach. In the 2010s, thousands of new books are published in Hebrew each year, both translations from other languages and original works by Israeli authors.

Notable songs
Su'mon Big Wheel (C'tait l'fun)
One of their ultimate naïve art-esque songs. A silly 10 second pieces with the title constituting the entire lyrics (On my Big Wheel, 'twas fun!). (A Big Wheel is a child's plastic tricycle toy). (listen)
Le Plombier
A thoroughly farcical song about a grotesque plumber sharing the name of ice hockey great Guy Lafleur, speaking fanatically about wrestling not being fake. The song grew out of a bet made to J-F Pauzé by singer Karl Tremblay to manage writing a song with bizarre, random expressions like Jaromir Jagr haircut, butt crack and Velveeta. And since that time, when I see the real Guy Lafleur on TV; I always have a little thought for a fat badly raised plumber! (listen)
Québécois de souche
A complete critical comical mocking of the anglicisms of the popular language of some Quebecers, and their corny lifestyles. I am an old-stock Québécois... My Bill 101, don't you dare touch it; It's not that I don't know how to speak well... but I'm an englished colon (in the sense of colonist)... (listen)
Mon Pays
Mon Pays, suivi du Reel des Aristocrates is a very amusing song which ends in a long reel and laying down the ludicrous theory that much of the Quebec independence-related defeats of the Quebec people throughout its history (the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, the Lower Canada Rebellion and the October Crisis) are caused by an almost endemic tradition of drunkenness. The Patriotes rebelled, the English regime will have to fall, they got out their ceintures fléchées! The Patriotes all agreed: to achieve victory, we will have to stop drinking! (listen live)
Le Gars d'la compagnie
It's about Trois-Rivières workers and the Quebec forest, as well as aboriginals, being exploited by American businessmen before the Quiet Revolution. This might be one of the few songs with little irony (although some lyrical passages are indeed ironic). And the guy from the company was laughing secretly; Who's the idiot that says that money doesn't grow on trees! (listen live)

Saint Joseph's Church (, ) is a church situated on the / in the Leopold Quarter of Brussels, Belgium. Built between 1842 and 1849 in eclectic style, it is a national sanctuary dedicated to Saint Joseph, who has been the patron saint of Belgium since 1679.
History
Inspired by the church of Trinità dei Monti in Rome, the architect Tilman-François Suys decided to create a church resembling one of Rome's many basilicas with a flat apse choir. The first stone of the building was laid by Cardinal Engelbert Sterckx on 6 April 1842. The Apostolic Nuncio, Cardinal Giacomo Cattani, consecrated the church on 24 June 1874 and also made it the National Shrine of Saint Joseph.
The church was occupied by the Redemptorists for many decades until it was looked after by the Syriac Orthodox from 1989 to 2001. It was then acquired by the Priory of Christ the King of the Society of St. Pius X, offering a much-needed place of worship for their growing number of parishioners.
The building received protected status through a royal decree issued on 13 May 1981.
Description
The church has three naves measuring a total of in length and in width. Its vault is high and is supported by two rows of Corinthian columns that separate the two aisles of the main church.

The 15th Air Army was a military formation of the Soviet Air Forces, active from July 1942 until December 1993.
History
It was formed between 11 July and 15 August 1942, in accordance with the directive of the commander of the Soviet Air Force of 10 July 1942, on the basis of the Air Force of the Bryansk Front. The formation of the army began in the village of Pavlovka (18 km southeast of the city of Yelets) in the Lipetsk Oblast.
The 15th Air Army received its baptism of fire in the autumn of 1942, participating in the defensive battles near Voronezh and in the elimination of the enemy's foothold on the left bank of the Don. In the winter of 1943, it supported the front troops in the Voronezh–Kastornoye operation.
In May 1943 it participated in an air operation to destroy German aircraft at airfields.
In July-August 1943, as part of the Battle of Kursk, she participated in the Orlov Strategic Offensive, and in September 1943, it supported the front troops in the Bryansk Offensive.
In October 1943, the Army was transferred to the 2nd Baltic Front, where it fought in the Leningrad–Novgorod Offensive and Riga Offensive (1944).
In 1945, the Army participated in the elimination of Army Group Courland and German forces in the Klaipeda area (January-February 1945).
During World War II, in total, 15th Air Army pilots made some 160,000 sorties.
After 1945
In the post-war period, the army was part of the Baltic Military District.
The 15th Air Army was renamed the 30th Air Army between 20 February 1949 and 4 April 1968.
The 15th Air Army was renamed the Air Forces of the Baltic Military District between December 1977 and May 1988. In spring 1980, the 899th Fighter Aviation Regiment, part of the 1st Guards Stalingradsko-Berlinskaya Red Banner Fighter Aviation Division, 15th Air Army, moved from Riga-Rumbula also in Latvia to Lielvārde airfield. In July 1981 the regiment was redesignated as a Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment and shifted to the 39th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Division, still within the Air Forces, but now within the Air Forces of the Baltic Military District, as it had become.
On 1 January 1991 the 15th Air Army consisted of the:
79th Separate Communications Regiment (Riga)
249th Separate Mixed Aviation Squadron (Riga) with 7 Mi-8, 1 Mi-6 and few transport aircraft
285th Separate Electronic Warfare Helicopter Squadron (Jelgava, Riga area) with 19 Mi-8
886th Order of the Red Banner "Stalingrad" Separate Reconnaissance Aviation Regiment (Jēkabpils, Latvian SSR) with 12 Su-24 and 14 Su-17M4. The regiment was known as the 16th Independent Reconnaissance Aviation Regiment (ORAP) during the Second World War.
39th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Division (Liyelvalde, Riga area), activated 1981.
53rd Guards "Stalingrad" Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment (Šiauliai, Lithuanian SSR) with 35 MiG-27 and 11 MiG-23
372nd Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment (APIB) (Daugavpils, Latvian SSR) with 49 MiG-27 and 12 MiG-23
899th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment (Lielvarde, Riga area) with 47 MiG-27 and 11 MiG-23.

Chang Fee Ming (, born 1959) is a Malaysian artist who works in watercolour, painting idyllic rural scenes. Chang is one of the most successful and highly regarded contemporary watercolourist in Southeast Asia. A self-taught artist, he began his career in the early 1980s.
He started his international travels in the early 1980s — to Nepal, India, Indochina — spending about two months on a trip. While his travelling and painting seemed intertwined, for him, travelling is not only for painting's sake. He said: "Throughout the journey, the things you see, the people you meet, even the air you smell can give you so much enjoyment. I don't count how many paintings I can do every trip — this way, the travel is full of potential and surprises." In the 1990s, he used to spend four months a year in Bali (where he has a studio), as he found that the island gave him good "chi" to paint.
However, his favourite place to visit is the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia, from Eastern Johor all the way to the end of Kelantan, where he is most happy as he knows the region well, and feels strongly connected to its people and culture, making it easy for him to paint the subjects related to the area.
Asked about his choice of watercolour as his medium for painting, he said: "It all began as a practical choice as it is non-cumbersome and easy to pack and use, and also odourless and easy to clean. But artistically, I was moved by the works of Malaysian East Coast watercolour painters such as the late Mat Zain and the great Khalil Ibrahim. Their watercolour paintings seem to capture the tones and moods of the region so well, convincing me that it was the medium to use for these subjects."
Despite his many travels to Indonesia for the past 30 years, it remains a favourite travel destination. His dream is to complete a thematic body of work for an exhibition called "Taman Mini Indonesia", to show his sketches and drawings on envelopes as a documentary of this beautiful multi-cultural country.
He is currently in Singapore (May 2016) to hold an exhibition called "A Traveller's Diary".

The 1986 Saskatchewan general election was held on October 20, 1986, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.
The Progressive Conservative government of Premier Grant Devine was returned for a second term with a reduced majority in the legislature.
While the New Democratic Party managed to increase its share of the popular vote and significantly increase its presence in the legislature, former Premier Allan Blakeney's attempt to return to power was unsuccessful. Despite winning slightly more votes than the Tories, most of the NDP margin was wasted on landslide margins in Regina and Saskatoon. While the NDP won eight seats in Regina and eight seats in Saskatoon, they only won nine seats in the rest of the province. As a result, they were consigned to Official Opposition status for another term.
The Liberal Party captured almost 10% of the popular vote, but elected only one member – party leader Ralph Goodale – to the legislature. The party's vote was spread out across the province, and was not concentrated in enough areas to translate into more seats.

The Chicotte River (French: Rivière Chicotte) is a tributary of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, flowing in the municipality of L'Île-d'Anticosti, in the Minganie Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of North Shore, in province of Quebec, in Canada.
A forest road (north–south direction) serves the west side of this valley and another on the east side; these roads connect to the south the coastal road of the island (east–west direction). These roads are mainly used for forestry and recreational tourism activities.
Forestry is the main economic activity in this area, particularly through Anticosti National Park which covers the upper part of the river; recreational tourism activities, second.
Geography
The Chicotte River draws its source from a mountain stream (altitude: ), located in the south-central part of the island. This source is located in a forest area at:
east of the town center of the village of Port-Menier;
south of the north shore of Anticosti Island;
northeast of the south shore of Anticosti Island.
From its source, the Chicotte River descends between the Rivière aux Rats (located on the west side) and the Rivière aux Plats (east side). The Chicotte River generally flows towards the southeast and the south over with a drop of , according to the following segments:
first to the south to a bend in the river corresponding to a stream (coming from the northwest); then towards the south-east in an increasingly deep valley, collecting a stream (coming from the north), until the discharge (coming from the north) of a small river;
in a deep valley, first towards the south-east leaving the territory of Anticosti National Park after about of this segment, up to a bend in the river; then south, curving south-east at the end of the segment, until the outlet of a stream (coming from the north-west);
first to the southeast in a deep valley until a bend in the river; towards the south curving towards the south-east; passing under the forest road bridge that runs along the southern coast of Anticosti Island; by crossing the Petit canyon Chicotte and passing in front of the locality Chicotte la Mer at the end of the segment, to its mouth.
The Chicotte River empties on the south shore of Anticosti Island, in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, on the west side of Cap des Caps. This confluence is located at east of Pointe des Morts, at east of the mouth of the Galiote River and at east of the village center of Port-Menier.
Toponymy
The toponymic designation "Chicotte River" appears on an 1856 map of Anticosti Island by geologist James Richardson. The spelling "Chicotte" derives from the English pronunciation of the French word "chicot", meaning debris of trees or shrubs.
The toponym “rivière Chicotte” was made official on December 5, 1968.
Recreational tourism activities
Anticosti National Park has an appendix to the southwest, that is, to the south of Lake Jolliet and to the south of the forest road leading southeast to Lake Martin; this park appendix covers approximately of the upper reaches of the Chicotte River. A path allows you to contemplate nature on the south shore, between the limit of the national park and the course of the river.

Heike Fleßner (14 April 1944 – 2 February 2021) was a German educationalist and professor, whose work focused on social education and social work. She was a Professor of Social Pedagogy at the Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg from 1996 until her retirement in 2009. Her scientific work focuses on analytics and conceptual developments in the field of gender- and diversity-conscious social education. For many years, Fleßner was involved in social policy and the institutional anchoring of public toddler care and early childhood education (crèche and kindergarten).
Career
Fleßner was born in Esens, East Frisia, Hanover, Prussia. From 1966 to 1971, she was a secondary school teacher. She later became a scientific assistant and then a director of studies at the University of Oldenburg. In 1980 she earned her doctorate degree from that university, studying the development of public preschool education in rural areas in Germany from 1870 to 1924. Her habilitation in 1994 – she received a venia legendi for educational science with a focus on social education, also at the University of Oldenburg – dealt with the topic "Motherhood as a profession: historical findings or current structural feature of social work?" In 1996, Fleßner was appointed by the university as a lecturer and Professor of Social Pedagogy. The following year, in 1997/98, she was a visiting professor of women's studies at Towson University in Maryland in the United States.
Fleßner was a co-founder of Gender studies at the University of Oldenburg, which began offering a Master's degree in Gender Studies in the 1997/98 school year and BA in Gender Studies beginning in 2007/08, and of the university's Center of Interdisciplinary Research on Women and Gender (ZFG) which opened in December 2000, and which she directed until her retirement in 2009.
Heike Fleßner died on 2 February 2021, at the age of 76.

The de Muyser Lantwyck family is an old Belgian family dating back to the beginning of the 15th century, tracing its roots to Jean Moyser, alderman of Vaelbeek (duchy of Brabant), who held lands in Héverlé in 1451, censier of the Groenendael Priory, lord holding the lands and manor of Cockelberg by lease dated 19 June 1438, husband of Aleyde Crabbé.
History
The son of Jean I, Gilles de Muyser, bought, in 1472, the manor of Hoff ten Rides in Bierbeek. His grandson, Jean II de Muyser, is son of Godefroid and brother of Pierre, is cited in 1494 and 1509 in the book of the fiefs of Héverlé as feudataire of Philippe de Croÿ, lord of Héverlé.
He married Ida de Lantwyck, daughter of Wautier before 1500. According to the aforementioned book of fiefs, Jean de Muyser died on 20 July 1531.
His descendants stayed in Vaalbeek, where the family remained, for every generation until the early 18th century, aldermen. These local offices were most likely given to the family as a souvenir of the lordship that was lost by Jean de Muyser's family. Indeed, a charter by Philip the Good dated to 1452 is kept at the Arenberg archives of the university of Louvain, tells us that Wautier de Lantwyck, father of Ida, definitively renounces in 1452, along with his siblings, all rights to the lordship of Vaalbeek that their father Jean was lord of until 1429. This lordship belonged to them through their grandfather, the knight Jean de Lantwyck, who had exchanged it for the lordship of Blanden. We know that the knight of Lanwyck, lord of Blanden, had sold to cense of half of the lordship of Blanden in 1388 to the Parc Abbey, but what happened to the other half remains a mystery.
Members
Between the 15th and 18th centuries, Muyser's family gave two aldermen and a burgomaster to Vaalbeek as well as an alderman to Neervelp :
John II of Muyser, alderman of Vaalbeek
John III of Muyser, alderman of Vaalbeek
John IV of Muyser, burgomaster of Vaalbeek about 1636, collector of ordinance in 1639, alderman in 1642 and 1644 and dorpmeester in 1649
Pierre de Muyser, alderman of Neervelp, from 1753 to 1762
From the 19th to the 20th century:
Albert-Walther de Muyser (1870–1917), postmaster
From the 20th to the 21st century:
Albert de Muyser (1920–2003), painter and racehorse owner

Founded in Kansas City, Missouri in 1908, the American Automobile Manufacturing Company acquired the Jonz Automobile Company of Beatrice, Nebraska in 1910 with a planned initial capitalization of $1,000,000. In early news releases, the company claimed "$100,000 of the stock has been subscribed for by Chicago and Kansas City men". Initial plans called for the establishment of factories in Kansas City and Louisville, Kentucky.
The company settled on moving its offices to Louisville, Kentucky in December, 1910, and began manufacturing in an abandoned woolen mill across the Ohio River from Louisville in New Albany, Indiana. The factory buildings were two and three stories in height, located on a six-acre tract on Vincennes Street in New Albany. The factory was reported in 1914 to be "one of the very largest factories in the state of Indiana... and is equipped with machinery, tools, raw materials, parts and accessories for the manufacture of motor cars."
Promising huge potential profits, the company sold stock using catalogs, pamphlets and an extensive magazine and newspaper ad campaign reaching as far as Great Britain. The company did produce a limited number of cars which were marketed as the Jonz (automobile), named after the "Jonz Tranquil Motor" developed by the three Jones brothers in Kansas. The American Automobile Manufacturing Company built the two-stroke engine "American" from 1911 to 1912 in New Albany.
American Automobile Corporation went bankrupt, and Ferdinand N. Kahler purchased its assets, forming the Ohio Falls Motor Company, largely to protect the assets of his woodworking business, The Kahler Company.

Timequest is an interactive fiction game released by Legend Entertainment, and written by Bob Bates. The game can be played online at the Internet Archive.
Plot
In the year 2090 AD, the use of time machines (called interkrons) is regulated by officers of the Temporal Corps. There is a strict prohibition against travel into the past, because of its potentially disastrous effects on the timestream and the catastrophic consequences for current civilization.
Zeke S. Vettenmyer, a Lieutenant in the Temporal Corps, has stolen an interkron, traveled back into the past, and subtly altered historical situations so that the outcomes of these events will be changed. The world as we know it will be destroyed as the effects of these changes ripple forward towards the present and cause massive disruptions in the timestream.
You are a private in the Temporal Corps. You have been selected to travel into the past and untangle Vettenmyer's twisted plot. You must pursue Vettenmyer across 3,000 years of history, going to the times and places that he has visited and reversing the changes that he has made which are currently threatening the future that defines your very existence.
Historical events
As the manual notes, there are ten historical events that Vettenmyer has tampered with. They are:
The death of Julius Caesar, Rome 44 BC
Attila the Hun's halted attack on Rome 452 AD
The Crowning of Charlemagne, Rome 800
An attempted coup by Yahya the Barmakid, who plotted to overthrow Caliph Harun al-Rashid, Baghdad 800
The signing of the Magna Carta, Dover 1215
The siege of Peking by Genghis Khan 1215
Hernán Cortés conquers the Aztecs, Mexico 1519
Sir Francis Drake visits Queen Elizabeth I, Dover 1588
Napoleon's attack on Egypt, Cairo 1798
The planning of Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of Dunkirk before an attack by Hitler, involving visits to Dover and Rome 1940
Historical figures
Several historical figures make appearances in the game besides the ones listed above. They include:
King Tut
Moses (as a baby)
Cleopatra
Pope Leo I
King Arthur
Robin Hood
Montezuma
William Shakespeare
Admiral Horatio Nelson
Winston Churchill
Benito Mussolini
Locations
The game features six major locations—Mexico, Dover, Rome, Cairo, Baghdad and Peking—each of which can be visited in various years ranging from 1361 BC to 1940 AD (although Mexico, Cairo and Baghdad cannot be visited in all years).
Famous locations that appear in the game include Lake Texcoco, Teotihuacan, Tenochtitlan, Stonehenge, Runnymede, the Cliffs of Dover, the Circus Maximus, St. Peter's Basilica, the Palazzo Braschi, the Great Pyramids, the Nile River, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Forbidden City and the Great Wall of China. The climax of the game takes place inside the Tower of Babel.
Dates
2090 AD (Time HQ)
1940 AD (Dover, Rome, Peking)
1798 AD (Dover, Rome, Cairo, Baghdad, Peking)
1588 AD (Dover, Rome, Cairo, Baghdad, Peking)
1519 AD (Mexico, Dover, Rome, Cairo, Baghdad, Peking)
1215 AD (Mexico, Dover, Rome, Cairo, Baghdad, Peking)
800 AD (Mexico, Dover, Rome, Cairo, Baghdad, Peking)
452 AD (Mexico, Dover, Rome, Cairo, Baghdad, Peking)
44 BC (Mexico, Dover, Rome, Cairo, Baghdad, Peking)
1361 BC (Mexico, Dover, Rome, Cairo, Baghdad, Peking)
Puzzles
Timequest is an extremely non-linear game in which the player immediately has access to six geographical locations in nine different time periods. Many of the puzzles can be tackled by picking a particular location and moving forward from the earliest time period (1361 BC). However, like most adventure games, solving puzzles in one location often relies on the use of items obtained elsewhere.
There are also a series of written clues scattered throughout the game, which require some note taking and some insight in putting the clues together into a message.
The main puzzle in the end of the game involves travelling quickly back and forth through time while interacting with versions of your past and future selves. This puzzle resembles similar sequences found in Sorcerer, Discworld and Escape from Monkey Island.

Vermouth (, ) is an aromatized fortified wine, flavoured with various botanicals (roots, barks, flowers, seeds, herbs, and spices) and sometimes colored. The modern versions of the beverage were first produced in the mid- to late 18th century in Turin, Italy. While vermouth was traditionally used for medicinal purposes, it was later served as an apéritif, with fashionable cafés in Turin serving it to guests around the clock. In the late 19th century, it became popular with bartenders as a key ingredient for cocktails, such as the martini, the Manhattan, the Rob Roy, and the Negroni. In addition to being consumed as an apéritif or cocktail ingredient, vermouth is sometimes used as an alternative to white wine in cooking.
Historically, there have been two main types of vermouth: sweet and dry. Responding to demand and competition, vermouth manufacturers have created additional styles, including extra-dry white, sweet white (blanc or bianco), red (rosso), amber (ambre), and rosé.
Vermouth is produced by starting with a base of a neutral grape wine or unfermented wine must. Each manufacturer adds additional alcohol and a proprietary mixture of dry ingredients, consisting of aromatic herbs, roots, and barks, to the base wine, base wine plus spirit, or spirit only – which may be redistilled before adding to the wine or unfermented wine must. After the wine is aromatized and fortified, the vermouth is sweetened with either cane sugar or caramelized sugar, depending on the style.
Italian and French companies produce most of the vermouth consumed throughout the world.
Etymology and history
Consumption of wines fortified with herbs or roots is believed to have begun in China at least as early as the Shang and Western Zhou dynasties (1250–1000 BC). The extra ingredients were added to wine to make it a medicinal drink. Medicinal drinks made by alcoholic fermentation of herbs and sugars are mentioned in early Indian texts on medicine, though this does not imply that European vermouths originated from ancient Chinese and Indian drinks. Recipes for infusing white wine date back to ancient Greece from around 400 BC. A popular ingredient was wormwood, based on the belief that it was effective at treating stomach disorders and intestinal parasites.
It was commonly used in Hungary at least since the 15th century with different species of artemisia plant like mugwort or wormwood and other spices like mustard seeds, horseradish, elfdock etc. Wormwood is called "üröm" or "irem" in Hungarian hence the drink is called "ürmös" (wormwoodish) or "ürmösbor" (wormwoodish wine). In the 16th century it was used with imported spices too like cinnamon, clove etc. It was well known for healing stomach and digesting problems.
The name "vermouth" is the French pronunciation of the German word Wermut for wormwood that has been used as an ingredient in the drink over its history. Fortified wines containing wormwood as a principal ingredient existed in Germany around the 16th century. At about this time an Italian merchant named D'Alessio began producing a similar product in Piedmont as a "wormwood wine". D'Alessio's version of the libation contained other botanical ingredients in addition to wormwood. Competing brands developed shortly thereafter in eastern and southeastern France, containing their own proprietary mix of ingredients, including herbs, roots, bark and spices.
By the mid-17th century, the drink was being consumed in England under the name "vermouth" which has been the common name for the beverage until the present day.
Over time, two distinct versions of vermouth became established, one pale, dry, and bitter, and the other red and sweeter. Merchant Antonio Benedetto Carpano introduced the first sweet vermouth in 1786 in Turin, Italy. The drink reportedly quickly became popular with the royal court of Turin. Around 1800 to 1813, the first pale, dryvermouth was produced in France by Joseph Noilly.However, not all pale vermouths produced over time have been dry, and not all red vermouths have been sweet.
The use of vermouth as a medicinal liquor waned by the end of the 18th century, but its use as an apéritif increased in Italy and France. By the late 19th century, vermouth was being used in cocktails. Bartenders found that it was an ideal mixer for many cocktails, including the Manhattan (beginning around 1880) and the precursors to the Martini. In addition, the popular Vermouth cocktail, first appearing in 1868, consisted of chilled vermouth and a twist of lemon peel with the occasional addition of small amounts of bitters or maraschino. The popularity of vermouth-heavy cocktails in America, often using twice as much vermouth as gin or whiskey, continued through the 1880s and 1890s. Although the amount of vermouth used in cocktail recipes had somewhat declined, it has recently been experiencing a rise as a favorite among a new breed of bartenders, as a key ingredient in many cocktails. Vermouth gained popularity in the 1950s with help from the Martini, which was being marketed by liquor companies. Product placement and celebrity endorsements from personalities such as Ernest Hemingway and Humphrey Bogart helped to increase the Martini's profile. However, the most successful advertiser of the Martini was the fictional character James Bond.
The popularity of vermouth in the United States and Great Britain declined after the mid-20th century, but was still used in those countries in many classic cocktails such as the Manhattan, albeit in smaller amounts. The drink is more popular in other parts of Europe (such as Italy, France and Spain, where it is often consumed by itself as an apéritif).
In the years since 2013, there has been renewed interest in vermouth in the US. Artisanal makers have created new brands of vermouth which do not seek to imitate European styles, and vermouth has been a fast-growing category within the wine trade.
Production, ingredients, and flavours
Several wine grapes, including Clairette blanche, Piquepoul, Bianchetta Trevigiana, Catarratto and Trebbiano, are generally used as the base ingredients for vermouths. From these grapes, a low-alcohol white wine is produced by vermouth manufacturers. The wine may be aged for a short while before the addition of other ingredients. For sweet vermouths, sugar syrup is added before the wine is fortified with extra alcohol. The added alcohol is usually a neutral grape spirit, but may also come from vegetable sources such as sugar beets. The wine is then placed in large barrels or tanks to which the dry ingredients have already been added. The mixture is stirred at intervals until the dry ingredients have been absorbed and the drink is ready for bottling. Red vermouths can derive their color from botanicals, added red wine, or sometimes from caramel color. Rose-colored vermouth uses red and white wines as its base. Most vermouths are bottled at between 16% and 18% ABV, as compared with the 9–14% ABV of most unfortified wines.
Spice ingredients often used in vermouths include cloves, cinnamon, quinine, citrus peel, cardamom, marjoram, chamomile, coriander, juniper, hyssop, ginger, and labdanum. The prohibition of wormwood as a drink ingredient in the early 20th century in some countries sharply reduced its use in vermouth, but small amounts of the herb are still sometimes included in artisan products. Vermouth brand recipes vary, with most manufacturers marketing their own unique flavour and version of the beverage. Vermouth manufacturers keep their recipes for the drink secret.
Sweet vermouths usually contain 10–15% sugar. The sugar content in dry vermouths generally does not exceed 4%. Dry vermouths usually are lighter in body than sweet vermouths.
In addition to pale and red vermouths, there exist golden and rosé versions, but these are not as internationally popular. The region of Chambéry in France has received an appellation d'origine contrôlée for its vermouths, which is where the blanc style originated and also includes a strawberry-flavored version called Chambéryzette. Lillet, St. Raphael and Dubonnet are fortified wines similar to vermouth, but are usually considered separate products. The two predominant styles of vermouth—the red, Italian rosso and the dry, white vermouth from France—were created and commercialized more than two centuries ago.
The term "Italian vermouth" is often used to refer to red-colored, mildly bitter, and slightly sweet vermouths. These types of vermouths have also been called "rosso." The label "French vermouth" generally refers to pale, dry vermouths that are more bitter than sweet vermouths. The extra bitterness is often obtained by using nutmeg or bitter orange peel in the drink recipe. Blanc or Bianco is a name given to a type of pale, sweeter vermouth.
According to Stuart Walton and Brian Glover, vermouth "is as far removed from the natural produce of the vine as it is possible for a fortified wine to get."
Modern use
Beverage
Vermouth is a common cocktail ingredient, particularly in Martinis and Manhattans. When vermouth is drunk by itself— which is seldom outside of Spain, Italy, Portugal, and France — it is normally consumed as an apéritif. Vermouth is used as an ingredient in many different cocktails, as people found it beneficial for lowering the alcohol content of cocktails with strong spirits as their base, for providing a pleasant herbal flavor and aroma, and for accentuating the flavors in the base liquor. As previously stated, vermouth is an ingredient in the martini, one of the most popular and well-known cocktails. At first, martinis used sweet vermouth. Around 1904, however, drier French vermouths began to be used in the cocktail. The term "dry martini" originally meant using a drier vermouth as a mixer, not using less vermouth, as the term is used today.
Sharon Tyler Herbst's book, The Ultimate A-To-Z Bar Guide, lists 112 cocktails using dry vermouth and 82 containing sweet vermouth. Cocktails using either dry or sweet vermouth or both include the Americano, Bronx, Gibson, Malecon, Manhattan, Negroni, Rob Roy, and Rose. Variations of cocktail recipes using equal portions of dry and sweet vermouths are called perfect, as in a Perfect Manhattan.
Cooking
While vermouth can be used as a substitute for white wine in food recipes, because it is more flavorful than wine, it may be overwhelming when used in certain dishes. The herbs in dry vermouth make it an attractive ingredient in sauces for fish dishes or as a marinade for other meats, including pork and chicken.
Storing
Because vermouth is fortified, an opened bottle will not sour as quickly as white wine. Opened vermouth, however, will gradually deteriorate over time. Gourmets recommend that opened bottles of vermouth be consumed within one to three months and should be kept refrigerated to slow oxidation.
Notable brands
The Carpano family originated several notable brands of vermouth, including Punt e Mes, a deep red vermouth with sweet and bitter flavors, and the Antica Formula brand, a bitter, fuller-flavored version of vermouth. Distillerie Fratelli Branca of Milan bought 50% of the Giuseppe B. Carpano company in 1982 and acquired the company outright in 2001. Gancia, Drapò Vermouth, Delmistero, 9diDANTE and Cocchi are other Italian producers.
The Cinzano family began production in 1757 in Turin. Their Bianco product is a sweet, pale vermouth.
vermouth from Chambéry, France, has been made since 1815. Their product lineup carries both a traditional dry, two different kinds of sweet (red and blanco), and a strawberry (chamberyzette). Dolin is recognized as creating the blanc style.
Martini & Rossi, the top-selling international brand of vermouth, started in 1863 in Turin and produces both dry and sweet vermouths, but is mostly known for its Rosso.Cinzano and Martini & Rossi also produce rosé vermouths, which are mainly distributed in Italy and France.
Noilly Prat, based in southern France, is primarily known for its dry, pale vermouths, but also produces a sweeter version. The company was founded by Joseph Noilly in 1813.

FREESTAR, which stands for Fast Reaction Experiments Enabling Science Technology Applications and Research, was a payload of six separate experiments on the Space Shuttle Columbia.
It was mounted on a crossbay Hitchhiker Multipurpose Equipment Support Structure in the Shuttle's payload bay during the STS-107 flight, which ended with the disintegration of Columbia during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. Although data was lost in the re-entry, much of the data collected while in space, such as that from MEIDEX, had already been transmitted to ground stations.
Experiments
The six experiments were:
Mediterranean Israeli Dust Experiment (MEIDEX)
The primary mission of the MEIDEX payload was to study the temporal and spatial distribution and physical properties of atmospheric desert dust over North Africa, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Saharan regions. The aim was achieved by a remote sensing experiment operated by the astronauts aboard the shuttle. Also, MEIDEX accomplished diverse secondary science objectives by performing slant visibility observations, sea-surface reflectivity observations, desert surface observations and observations of Transient Luminous Events, better known as sprites. MEIDEX also made the first space observation of a glory.
Shuttle Ozone Limb Sounding Experiment-02 (SOLSE-02)
SOLSE-2 was a hyperspectral imaging spectrometer built at the Goddard Space Flight Center that demonstrated a new technique to measure the vertical distribution of ozone in the atmosphere. The first demonstration flight of SOLSE-1 was on STS-87 in 1997. Once proven over a wider range of viewing conditions, the SOLSE-2 technique was incorporated to routinely measure ozone by the next generation of weather satellites, including the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS), that was launched in 2011.
Critical Viscosity of Xenon-2 (CVX-2)
The Critical Viscosity of Xenon-2 Experiment measures the viscous behavior of xenon – a heavy, inert gas used in flash lamps and ion rocket engines – at its critical point.
The data from the CVX-2 experiment was believed lost in the disaster. The hard drive that carried its data, a Seagate ST9385AG 2.5" hard drive with 400 MB storage capacity, was found and believed to be melted beyond recognition. In 2008, however, a data recovery specialist cleaned the hard drive's storage platters and rebuilt them into a new hard drive. They were able to recover 99% of the data, saving the experiment.
Solar Constant Experiment-3 (SOLCON-3)
The SOLCON instrument is designed to accurately measure the solar constant and identify variations in the value during a solar cycle. SOLCON measures the solar irradiance in space to avoid perturbations by the atmosphere of the Earth. It is also used as a reference to construct a long-duration time series of the solar irradiance. This data will ensure continuity of the solar constant level obtained by instruments mounted on free flyers, over climate time-scale duration.
Space Experiment Module (SEM)
The SEM is made up of 11 separate student experiments from schools across the United States and is the 14th flight of a SEM on the Space Shuttle.
Low Power Transceiver (LPT) experiment
The Low Power Transceiver is a compact, flexible device that can be configured to perform custom communications and navigation functions in terrestrial, airborne and space applications.

The 2005 Lake Tanganyika earthquake occurred at on 5 December with a moment magnitude of 6.8 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X (Extreme). The shock occurred along the East African Rift, an active continental rift zone in East Africa that is characterized by normal faulting, and initiated at a depth of .
Early reports indicated that the heaviest damage was sustained by the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a region already ravaged by extensive war and extreme poverty. The area houses tens of thousands of refugees displaced by conflicts, such as the Second Congo War and the Burundian Civil War, that have plagued the African Great Lakes in the 1990s and 2000s.
Dozens of houses collapsed in the DRC city of Kalemie. A UN spokesman said that most of the casualties were caused by falling zinc or steel roofs.
Depending on several factors including soil types, prevalent construction techniques and the acceleration from the earthquake itself, earthquakes with magnitudes in the 6–7 range may or may not cause widespread damage. In East Africa such seismic events can wreak havoc. The quake was centred roughly below Lake Tanganyika and – in addition to the DRC, where the most widespread damage has been reported – it was felt in Burundi, Tanzania, Rwanda, and as far away as Mombasa, Kenya, and Luanda, Angola.

Maganja da Costa District is a district of Zambezia Province in Mozambique.
Introduction
The name probably derives from that of the Mang'anja people, now mainly resident in southern Malawi. However, from the 17th century onwards, Portuguese explorers used the name Manganja as a territorial designation, and called the people living in that area Maganjas. The original area occupied by the Mang'anja, and the area called Manganja, extended south and east of the area this people currently occupy, and the name of the town Maganja da Costa ("Maganja of the Coast"), about 20 kilometres inland from the Indian Ocean near Pebane records their former eastern extent. At present, the population of the area is mixed, and the largest group consists of Makua people from northern Mozambique who first arrived in the 19th century. The area does not now contain any Mang'anja people, but in 1960 the oldest inhabitants recalled that a few survivors of the original population still spoke the Mang'anja language and used to visit rain shrine of M'Bona in southern Nyasaland, a cult exclusive to Mang'anja people.
The Alves da Silva
During the 19th century, for major Afro-Portuguese or Afro-Asian families established in Mozambique were involved in the Zambezi wars. The Caetano Pereira to the north of the Zambezi river, the Vaz dos Anjos of Indian origin near Quelimane, the Da Cruz, also near Quelimane, whose founder was from Thailand and Alves da Silva. The Maganja da Costa district became the stronghold of the Alves da Silva family. Its founder, António Alves da Silva, came from the province of Beira in Portugal in the early 19th century and established a trade in ivory and slaves, engaging a number of African soldiers or "sipais" from the Sena district. His two sons, João Bonifacio and Victorino Romão, became prominent slave traders operating in the Luangwa and Lower Shire valleys. As they were unable to use the port of Quelimane after the banning of the legal slave trade in 1830, they built a number of fortified villages called “aringas”, consisting of a wooden stockade and earthworks in the form of a ditch and bank in the district. The aringas were manned by about a dozen chikunda bands or "ensacas" of armed retainers, initially each of around 250 men, under its own captain. The largest da Silva aringa in the Maganja da Costa district was known as M'Passue after the African title used by the head of the family, and it was said to be the largest aringa ever built in Mozambique. Much of the slave trade on the central Mozambique coast was in the hands of the Angoche sultanate, which came into conflict with the Alves da Silva as its slave raiding moved further inland. João Bonifacio was killed in 1861 when unsuccessfully attacking an Agoche barracoon, and Victorino Romão died childless in 1874, ending the direct line of succession from António Alves da Silva
The "Military Republic"
After the death of Victorino Romão, Maganja da Costa evolved into a form of chikuna republic. Mist of the major decisions, particularly those related to warfare, were taken by assemblies of the chikunda, although each band elected a captain, or "Kazembe" of their aringa from the leaders of the squads making up the band, and each of the 12 Kazembes formed a council for the military leader, or captain-general that they elected from among themselves. The Portuguese military commander, João de Azevedo Coutinho, called this arrangement the "Military Republic of Maganja da Costa". The ensacas, originally of about 250 men, grew to between 1,000 and 1,200 men each. They were recruited from enslaved captives, but after some years of satisfactory service, they gained a degree of freedom and were granted privileges, including a share of the tribute extracted from the local population.
By the 1890s, the "Military Republic" was in decline as the illicit slave trade had largely been suppressed. The Mozambique Company, founded in 1891, began to encroach on the area over which the Maganja da Costa chikunda believed that they had a monopoly of ivory trading and, in 1892, attacked and destroyed several of the company's trading posts. However, at other times they cooperated with the Portuguese and, in 1897, de Azevedo Coutinho was able to recruit an armed force from the Maganja da Costa chikunda to overcome resistance to Portuguese colonial rule in the Zambezi valley. Once resistance in other areas had been suppressed, Maganja da Costa was itself occupied in 1898, by Portuguese forces, in alliance with several local chiefs opposed to the chikunda. Although the Maganja da Costa chikunda resisted, their armaments were out of date and they suffered 600 dead and many captured when their independence was ended.

Bashkim Shehu (born 22 June 1955, Tirana) is an Albanian writer who lives in Barcelona, Spain.
Biography
From 1975 to 1980, he studied Liberal Arts at the University of Tirana. Until 1981, he worked as a screenwriter at Kinostudio Shqipëria e Re. At that time his father, Mehmet Shehu, was Albania's Prime Minister and a leading candidate to replace Enver Hoxha. This connection allowed him access to literary works that were banned by the Communist regime. His exposure to those works prompted his decision to become a writer. His first work appeared in 1977 and, until 1981, he worked as a screenwriter at Kinostudio Shqipëria e Re.
That year, Hoxha accused his father of being a foreign agent. The elder Shehu was found dead in December and Bashkim was sentenced to ten years in prison for distributing subversive propaganda. In 1989, his sentence was reduced to eight years, but he was still kept under house arrest after his release from Spaç Prison. His freedom was restored when the Communist government fell in 1991. He returned to his position at the Kinostudio (now "Albfilm") and remained there until 1993, when he went to Hungary to study sociology at the University of Budapest.
Upon returning to Tirana, he became a monitor for the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights. In 1997, during the Albanian Civil War, he went into self-exile and settled in Barcelona, where he still resides. After ten years of being an advisor to the Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona, he became a freelance writer. He and his companion, Edlira Hoxholli, also translate English, Spanish and French works into Albanian.

Let the Music Play is the third studio album by Australian-New Zealand recording artist Stan Walker, released through Sony Music Australia on 18 November 2011. Walker worked with several record producers on the album, including Richard Vission, Chico Bennett, Nicholas "RAS" Furlong and Static Revenger, among others. The album featured several guest vocalists, including Jessica Mauboy, Annabel Fay and Walker's mother April, who is featured in a remake of Eva Cassidy's version of "Songbird". Musically, the album features more up-tempo dance-pop and R&B genres than Walker's previous album, From the Inside Out (2010), which included deep and emotional tracks.
Two singles preceded the album's release including, lead single "Loud", which reached the top-ten on the singles charts of Australia and New Zealand. "Light It Up", featuring Static Revenger, was released as the album's second single. Let the Music Play debuted at number 18 on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart, becoming the lowest charting album of Walker's career to date. On the New Zealand Albums Chart, the album debuted at number 12.
Background and recording
Walker described the album as "a declaration of a celebration", stating that it is far more upbeat, playful and fresh in comparison to the deeper tracks on his previous album From the Inside Out (2010). In an interview with Nathan Taylor from Western Weekender, Walker explained, "The last album was more serious and showed the deeper parts of me. This one still shows all the depths of me but also me as a 21-year-old – the young, crazy and fun side definitely comes out in Let the Music Play." The album was inspired by many sounds from around the world, including Indian Bollywood to UK bubble gum pop and Māori culture.
Let the Music Play was recorded over four weeks; Walker recorded much of the album in the United States. The album includes a duet with Walker's mother, April, in a remake of Eva Cassidy's version of "Songbird". Walker said that he had to find the right song to sing with his mother on one of his album's, and chose Cassidy's version of "Songbird" because it is one of their all-time favourite songs. Let the Music Play also includes a duet with fellow singer Jessica Mauboy on the track "Galaxy", which had originally appeared on a re-release of her second studio album Get 'Em Girls. Walker explained, "We had been waiting for the right song to come for a while, because we really had to choose the right song for this. And that song came about and we both really liked it and decided that was the one, and that we just had to do it. And it turned out really well."
In an interview with Leesa Smith from Southern Courier, Walker explained, "The album is quite pop and dance-y, but there are hints of old skool stuff, like the duet I did with my mum. There are songs about freedom, liberation, unity and music."
Release and promotion
Let the Music Play was released by Sony Music Australia on 18 November 2011, as both digital download and CD formats. A CD release in New Zealand followed on 21 November 2011. To celebrate the album's release, Walker appeared at the Westfield Parramatta store in Sydney with dance troupe Justice Crew on 19 November 2011, to perform several of the album's songs and sign CDs. The following day, he appeared at the Highpoint Shopping Centre in Melbourne. During a promotional tour in New Zealand, Walker appeared at The Warehouse Sylvia Park in Auckland on 24 November 2011, to sign CD copies and perform a song from the album. On 29 November 2011, Walker and Jessica Mauboy made a guest appearance on the Australian breakfast television program, Sunrise, to perform "Galaxy".
Singles
"Loud" was released as the album's lead single on 6 May 2011. It peaked at number nine on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart and number eight on the New Zealand Singles Chart. "Loud" was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), for selling 70,000 copies. In New Zealand, it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ), for selling 7,500 digital copies. "Light It Up", featuring Static Revenger, was released as the second single on 16 September 2011. It peaked at number 45 on the ARIA Singles Chart and number 23 on the New Zealand Singles Chart. "Music Won't Break Your Heart" was released as a Digital EP on 23 March 2012, as the third single from Let the Music Play.
Commercial performance
Let the Music Play debuted at number 18 on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart on 28 November 2011 and spent two weeks in the top 50. It marks the first time in Walker's career that one of his albums has missed the top five. His debut studio album, Introducing Stan Walker (2009) debuted at number three, while his second studio album, From the Inside Out (2010) charted at number two. On the ARIA Urban Albums Chart, Let the Music Play debuted at number three. On the New Zealand Albums Chart, the album debuted at number 12, again becoming Walker's first album in the country to miss the top five.

Modliborzyce is a town in Janów Lubelski County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Modliborzyce. It lies in the historic province of Lesser Poland, approximately north-west of Janów Lubelski and south of the regional capital Lublin. It has a population of 1,311.
Modliborzyce is picturesquely located at the point where three major geographical regions of Poland meet - Lublin Upland, Sandomierz Basin, and Roztocze. Southern part of the town belongs to the Landscape Park of Janów Forest, and northern is covered by the protected area of Roztocze.
Name
The name comes from Modliborzyce, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, which had existed before the foundation of the town. The name Modliborzyce itself is based on an ancient Polish given name Modlibog.
History
The history of the town dates back to February 27, 1631, when a local nobleman Stanisław Wioteski of Rola coat of arms received King Sigismund III Vasa's permission to found a town in the area of the already-existing village of Słupie. The town was called Modliborzyce, and in 1644-1664, the church of St. Stanisław was built. The Wioteski family's Rota coat of arms is the town's official coat of arms since. After the Wioteski family, the town belonged to Mikołaj Słoniewski. In the second half of the 17th century, a synagogue was opened, due to a steady influx of Jewish settlers. During the Great Northern War, in 1706 Russian troops were garrisoned in Modliborzyce, which had a negative influence on the development of the town. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Modliborzyce belonged to several noble families - the Nahorecki, the Wierciński, the Doliński and the Gorzkowski. Since 1815 the town belonged to Russian-controlled Congress Poland. Modliborzyce burned in 1804 and 1841, and in 1855 its population was decimated by the cholera.
During the January Uprising, on initiative of a local nobleman Ignacy Solman, a regiment was formed, which was engaged in a skirmish with the Russians near Janów Lubelski. Solman was killed by the Cossacks, and in 1869 Russian government punished Modliborzyce by reducing it to the status of a village. Modliborzyce was again part of independent Poland since 1918, when the country regained sovereignty after World War I.
During the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the Luftwaffe twice bombed Modliborzyce (September 8 and 15). As a result, 87 people died and most of the buildings in the town were destroyed. The local wójt (head of the gmina) Karol Potocki was murdered by the Germans during large massacres of Poles committed in 1940 in Rury, Lublin as part pf the AB-Aktion. In 1940 German authorities brought some 1,200 Jews from Vienna to the Modliborzyce ghetto. This group later perished – with the local Jewish population of 1,200 Jews – at Bełżec extermination camp in October and November of 1942. The Jewish community ceased to exist. Modliborzyce was one of local centers of the Home Army, and German occupation ended in July 1944.
Town rights of Modliborzyce were restored on 1 January 2014.
Sights
Due to its location, Modliborzyce is a tourist center of local importance. Its most important points of interest are the Baroque church of Saint Stanislaus (1644–1664), bell tower (1775), and a synagogue (1760), which now houses the center of culture.

Huqin () is a family of bowed string instruments, more specifically, a spike fiddle popularly used in Chinese music. The instruments consist of a round, hexagonal, or octagonal sound box at the bottom with a neck attached that protrudes upwards. They also usually have two strings, and their soundboxes are typically covered with either snakeskin (most often python) or thin wood. Huqin instruments usually have two tuning pegs, one peg for each string. The pegs are attached horizontally through holes drilled in the instrument's neck. Most huqin have the bow hair pass in between the strings. Exceptions to having two strings and pegs include variations of huqin with three, four, and sometimes even more than five. These include the zhuihu, a three stringed huqin, the sihu, a huqin of Mongolian origin, and the sanhu, a lesser-known three-stringed variation.
The most common huqin are the erhu, which is tuned to a middle range; zhonghu, which is tuned to a lower register, and gaohu, which is tuned to a higher pitch. The lowest pitched huqins include the dahu and gehu. The highest pitched huqin is the jinghu, used in the Beijing opera. Over eighty types of huqin instruments have been documented.
Huqin instruments are believed to have come from the nomadic Hu people, who lived on the extremities of ancient Chinese kingdoms, possibly descending from an instrument called the Xiqin (奚琴), originally played by the Mongolic Xi tribe. Like the people of China, Mongolian people also have cultural and ethnic heritage of the ancient Hu nomads, and the Mongol version of the xiqin, known as the khuuchir, is testament to this shared heritage.
In the 20th century, large bass huqin such as the dihu, gehu, and diyingehu were developed for use in modern Chinese orchestras. Of these, the gehu and diyingehu would be analogous to Occidental cellos and double basses respectively, and were designed to have a timbre that would blend in with the sound of traditional huqin. These instruments generally have four strings and fingerboards, and are played in a similar manner to cellos and double basses, and are very different from the traditional huqin.
Similar instruments also feature in the music traditions of neighboring countries, such as Mongolia, Korea, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos.

Tang Ying (; 1682–1756) was a Qing dynasty writer, playwright and ceramist. He was the Superintendent of the Imperial porcelain works in Jingdezhen where he served over a period twenty-eight years under two emperors. His tenure at the Imperial kilns was noted for some of the finest porcelain produced during the Qing dynasty, and the porcelain produced under his supervision is known as Tangyao (唐窯) or Tang ware. He also wrote a number of books on porcelain, as well as 17 plays for kunqu-style regional operas.
Early life
Tang Ying was born on the 5th day of the 5th month in the 21st year of Kangxi reign (1682) in Fengtian (奉天) in today's Shenyang, Liaoning. His great-grand-father Tang Yingzu was a bondservant leader serving in the Plain White Banner of the Han army, therefore he was technically born a bondservant, but he is normally described as a Han Bannerman in Chinese biographies. He entered into the service of the Imperial Household Department when he was 16 working as a page. He worked in Yangxin Hall which housed a library of books and paintings; there he acquired a knowledge of art and skill in painting, design and writings. He appeared to know Yongzheng well before he became emperor; in 1723, soon after Yongzheng came to the throne, he was appointed to the position of Vice Director of the Imperial Household Department, acting as foreman for the artisans working in the Imperial workshops.
Porcelain
While he was working at the Imperial Household Department, Tang Ying produced designs for decorating porcelain pieces. In 1728, during the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor, Tang Ying was sent to Jingdezhen in Jiangxi to supervise the production of Imperial porcelain. Tang was initially assistant to Nian Xiyao, working as the resident Manager at Jingdezhen. Tang was said to have learnt making pottery by living closely with the workmen at Jingdezhen for three years. In 1735, during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor, he replaced Nian who was accused of corruption. Although in control of Jingdezhen as Superintendent of the Imperial porcelain works, he was stationed most of the time at Huai'an or Jiujiang Custom Offices since he was also responsible for collecting custom duties.
Tang was the only superintendent who had a close understanding of the potting process, and played a significant role in the development of ceramics production in Jingdezhen. Under Tang's supervision, the quality of the Jingdezhen improved and some of the finest porcelain produced during the Qing dynasty were made during his tenure. He was able to communicate effectively what the Emperor wanted to the workmen to produce the ware required, and his writings on porcelain provided invaluable information on the production of Jingdezhen porcelain in this period. He also personally made porcelain pieces signed with his various names.
Tang Ying introduced a number of innovations during his tenure at Jingdezhen, such as new colours (for example different shades of purple and blue) and glazes, and introduced new designs and techniques (e.g. silvering and painting in ink black). He managed to reproduce textures and effects of wares of other material such as silver, wood, jade or bronze, copied porcelain from other countries, and he was also known for revival of old forms and faithful imitation of antique wares such as those of the Song era.
Porcelain pieces produced for two Qing emperors under Tang Ying's supervision are highly regarded, and their quality is considered unmatched before or during his time. A vase believed to have been presented by Tang Ying to Qianlong Emperor fetched a record price of US$69.5 million at auction in 2010, although it was later sold for US$35 million after the original buyer disputed the auctioneer's fees. Another was sold for US$19 million in 2018, while a smaller piece from 1742 sold for US$9 million in 2020. These yangcai vases have a reticulated form with double walls, an innovation introduced by Tang Ying in the early 1740s. These vases were technically difficult and expensive to produce and Tang Ying presented nine such single vases to Qianlong.
Tang also served for a short period (1750–51) in Canton in the Maritime Customs Service. He returned to Jingdezhen, but retired in 1756 and died shortly afterwards on the 27th day of the 7th month the same year. Although his successor was able to maintain some standard at Jingdezhen, the quality of porcelain produced declined, and after the reign Qianlong, the quality of porcelain produced in Jingdezhen deteriorated.
Theatre
Tang Ying became interested in the local popular theatre. He was unusual in seeking inspiration from local theatre for his plays, and more than half of the plays he wrote feature content derived from popular local theatre. The plays he wrote are eclectic, where Kunqu opera melodies are mixed with local ones. He wrote 17 operas, among the best-known are Crossroad at the Slope () and Laughter in a Flour Barrel (). Crossroad at the Slope is a single-act play derived from the local bangzi opera (折子戲), and features a story from the Water Margin. Laughter in a Flour Barrel tells the story of a quick-witted courtesan who survived abuse. Other plays include Predestined Debt (), a twenty-scene play from 1754.
Other works
Tang Ying wrote or supervised the writing of a number of books on porcelain which are important documents on porcelain making during the Qing dynasty, such as The Order of Porcelain-making (Twenty Illustrations of the Manufacture of Pottery) (陶冶圖編次), a book written at Qianlong's command. Other books on pottery include Record of Pottery Production (陶成紀事), A Summary of the Pottery Business (陶務敘略), and Draughts of Instructions on the Manufacture of Porcelain (瓷務事宜諭稿).
Tang also wrote poetry and excelled at calligraphy and paintings. His poetry is collected in Collections of Songs during the Reign of Kangxi and in Potters Thoughts (陶人心语). His calligraphy and paintings are kept among the Palace Museum collection.

Svenska Cupen (), Svenska Cupen i bandy, is a knockout cup competition in Swedish bandy and the main bandy cup only open for domestic Swedish teams.
The first year was 2005, and was won by Edsbyns IF. The first women's edition was played in 2019, and won by Västerås SK.
Starting for the second year of the cup, a qualification round was made with matches played at different locations around Sweden in January. The real cup was then played at one location in the beginning of or mid-October. Since bandy is a winter sport with a season from autumn to spring, this meant that the qualification games were played in another season than the final cup was played, which could mean that a qualified club could come to the cup with a team consisting of many other players compared to the qualification round, as players are usually traded during the summer. For the 2010 Svenska cupen the qualification round was moved to August–September and the final cup was made smaller, from earlier 16 teams to now 8.
The cup in October has been played in Edsbyn, Västerås, Vänersborg and Linköping in different years.

George Legge, 1st Baron Dartmouth PC (c. 1647 – 1691) was an English Royal Navy officer, who was appointed Admiral of the Fleet by James II in September 1688. However, he failed to intercept the invasion force under William III that landed at Torbay on 5 November 1688 and was dismissed following the Glorious Revolution.
Personal details
George Legge was born in 1647, the eldest son of Colonel William Legge (1608-1670) and his wife Elizabeth Washington (c.1616–1688). A close friend of Prince Rupert of the Rhine, Colonel Legge served in the Royalist army during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and was arrested several times during The Protectorate for conspiring to restore Charles II. After the Stuart Restoration in 1660, he was appointed Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, a position he held from 1660 to 1670.
His younger son William (circa 1650-1697), MP for Portsmouth in 1685, was "a wild, profane creature", who allegedly killed a man while still in his teens. His daughter Mary (1647-1715) married diplomat and politician Sir Henry Goodricke (1642-1705).
In November 1667, Henry married Barbara Archbold (1650–1718), daughter of Sir Henry Archbold of Abbots Bromley in Staffordshire; they had a son, William (1672-1750), and seven girls. His daughter Mary (died 1753) married Sir Philip Musgrave (1661-1689), who served under Legge as Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance from 1682 to 1687.
Career
Educated at Westminster School and King's College, Cambridge, Legge began his naval career during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, when he served as a volunteer under his cousin Admiral Sir Edward Spragge in the 1666 Four Days' Battle. Thanks to these connections, at the age of twenty in April 1667 he was made Captain of HMS Pembroke, a 28-gun fifth-rate, which sank on 11 May following a collision with near Torbay.
Despite this inauspicious beginning, he was appointed Groom of the Chamber to the future James II of England in 1669, then given command of HMS Fairfax in January 1672. In late March, he took part in an attack on a Dutch Levant Company convoy in the Channel, which was beaten off by its escort but became an immediate cause of the Third Anglo-Dutch War. In June he fought in the Battle of Sole Bay. The following year he commanded under Prince Rupert of the Rhine in the Battle of Schooneveld.
By 1683 Legge had risen to be Admiral and he was sent out to Tangier with Samuel Pepys to oversee the evacuation and destruction of the ill-fated English colony there. His last naval appointment was to the command of a fleet in the channel which unsuccessfully attempted to intercept the invasion force led by William III of Orange that landed in 1688 at the beginning of the Glorious Revolution. The same year he was appointed the first Admiral of the Fleet.
Death
Following the abdication of James II, Dartmouth was dismissed by the triumphant William III, and imprisoned in the Tower of London in July 1691. He died in the Tower a few months later, on 25 October, without having been brought to trial, and was buried, as his father had been, in the church of the Holy Trinity, Minories, in London. He was succeeded as Baron Dartmouth by his only son, William Legge, 1st Earl of Dartmouth (1672–1750).

Pocket Venus were a Welsh rock band from Conwy in North Wales. Their style was that of a harder-edged Britpop and they played all over the UK and received national airplay on BBC Radio 1. Pocket Venus split in 2003 during negotiations with major record labels, the band cited musical and personal differences as the reason for the breakup. In late 2010 Pocket Venus reformed.
History
Formation (1998 - 2003)
Pocket Venus, from North Wales formed in 1998, an amalgamation of various members of earlier bands, the original line up was Chris Yates, Naldo Algieri, Steve Jones, Chris Bainbridge and Mark Kendall (formerly of Y Cyrff). The line up changed in 1999 when guitarist Chris Bainbridge left transferring rhythm guitar duties to Chris Yates. Keyboardist Dave Robinson joined shortly after but the lineup changed again in 2000 when drummer Mark Roberts left the band to be replaced by Pete Ryan. The band were managed by Neil Crud, who released two singles for them on his Secrets of Sound record label. First release; "Make It Through Your Day" had good reviews and received airplay on BBC Radio One from John Peel and Mark Radcliffe, and also airings on BBC Radio Wales from Adam Walton, who invited the band on his show for a session. The band produced a video for their second release Tell Me Why, which is still available on YouTube and the NME's official website. gigs and an energetic stage performance led to more airplay from radio stations both across the UK and internationally, notably winning "Best International Artist" at the Orange County Music Awards. The lineup changed again in late 2002 with the departure of Steve Jones on lead guitar. Jones's place was taken by Dyfed Roberts formerly of Gwacamoli. The band continued to play live shows until August 2003 when the band split up. The band had become disillusioned and disheartened by the music industry, so in order to save their friendships and personal relationships they went their separate ways.
Post-breakup activities (2003 - 2010)
After the band split Yates and Roberts went on to form Gotti, with Steve Flavell on drums and bass player Mauve. Gotti played locally and also recorded a number of demo tapes. Ryan, Algieri and Robinson stayed away from the music scene for various reasons and concentrated on their family lives and other responsibilities. The band attempted to reform in 2008 but never got past the rehearsal stage.
Reunion (2010 - present)
In December 2010, Yates, Algieri and Robinson were joined by Chris Ryan on lead guitar and John "Hargi" Hargest on drums for a low key gig in North Wales announcing the band's return. Hargi was replaced on drums by Simon Barton early on, since then the band have played a number of gigs and have recently released a new E.P, Back to Make it Better, tracks include "Back To Make It Better", "Godspeed" and "Life Of Misery". The E.P has received national airplay and has helped the band reach a wider audience.
The band is also supporting various charities including rereleasing their E.P Tell Me Why for Help For Heroes, and also playing gigs to support the Oxjam Music Festival. The band have suggested, via their Facebook page, that they intend to begin recording their debut, full-length album in 2013.
Live
Pocket Venus played at many of the more infamous London venues including the Garage in Highbury, The Water Rats in St Pancras and The Bull And Gate in Kentish Town. The band played several festivals during their career playing Pigstock in North Wales and also played alongside Reef at the prestigious Wakestock festival. Pocket Venus have also played Manchester's world-renowned "In The City" showcase festival.
The band played at Club 147 in Llandudno with Talk To Angels and Danny McNamara of Embrace on Friday 2 September 2011. Later the band performed an acoustic set with Chris Helme of The Seahorses and supported Ultrasound at the launch of their new album at the Borderline Club, in Soho, and again in Llandudno on 14 December 2012.

Messier Channel is a channel located in Patagonia, Chile. It trends north–south between Wellington Island and other Pacific islands and the continent, and is bounded on the north by the Gulf of Penas. Southward the name of this inside passage changes first to Angostura Inglesa (English Narrows) and then to Paso del Indio.
The channel is named after Charles Messier, who was a French astronomer. It is a fjord in the Scandinavian sense of the word. A depth of 1,358 m has been measured in the north part of this channel, making it one of the deepest fjords in the world. Messier Channel is surrounded by the Bernardo O'Higgins National Park and the Katalalixar National Reserve.
The Fallos-Ladrillero-Picton Channel combination is an optional route to the Messier-Grappler-Wide Channels route between the Golfo de Penas and the Trinidad Channel.
Just north of Angostura Inglesa (English Narrows), is the wreck of MV Capitán Leonidas, a small freighter that ran aground on the Bajo Cotopaxi (Cotopaxi Bank) in 1968. The hulk provides warning as both a shipwreck and lighthouse (NGA-nr: 2068, Adm.: G 1552).

The Arriflex 16BL is ARRI's first silent 16mm production motion picture camera, released in 1965.
Function
The functionality is similar to the Arriflex 16M. It is built around the spinning reflex twin-bladed "butterfly" mirror shutter, set at 45 degrees horizontally to the lens axis. It is self blimped and measures 31 dB while running, in 3 ft distance from the camera.
The 16BL introduced the ARRI Bayonet lens mount, which was also used in later cameras. This stainless steel mount is much stronger than the aluminium Arri standard mount. The viewfinder is located on the gate door.
The Arriflex 16ST can load 1200 ft and 400 ft external magazines, which can be attached to the top. The camera is driven by a 12V crystal control motor, which can be controlled on the right side. It can record between 8 and 48 fps.
The standard matte box is adjustable in length to fit the different focal lengths of the lenses.
Trivia
During the development this camera model was called Arriflex 16Q, for "quiet". The name was changed to Arriflex 16BL, for "blimped".
The Arriflex 16BL is still popular among independent filmmakers today, since it is one of the cheapest silent 16mm cameras.

Woodland Grey is a 2021 Canadian independent horror film directed and co-written by Adam Reider, and starring Jenny Raven, Ryan Blakely, and Art Hindle.
Cast
Jenny Raven as Emily
Ryan Blakely as William
Art Hindle as Moses
Release
Woodland Grey premiered at the Blood in the Snow Canadian Film Festival (BITS) on November 22, 2021. It screened at the Another Hole in the Head Film Festival in San Francisco, California, in December 2021. It is scheduled to screen at Cinema On The Bayou festival in Lafayette,Louisiana, in January 2022.
Reception
Dakota Dahl of Rue Morgue praised the film's music and the "unnatural on purpose" performances of Raven and Blakely, but referred to Hindle as "brutally under utilized". Dahl lamented the film as being "slow and weird for weirdness sake, in a way that is neither thoughtful nor rewarding"; comparing it unfavourably to surrealist films by David Lynch, Dahl wrote that, unlike Lynch's works, Woodland Grey "doesn't seem to have that original vision, instead opting to provide clues and red herrings that point to multiple conclusions, while really sticking the landing with none of them."

Ruggero Berlam (20 September 1854 – 22 October 1920) was an Austrian architect.
Born in Trieste (then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire), he followed in the family tradition, as his father Giovanni Andrea had already stood out as architect with buildings like Palace Gopcevich near the seafront in Trieste. Ruggero Berlam was also skillful designer-painter. He completed his education in Milan at the Brera Academy, where he was taught by Camillo Boito that architecture should "be linked to an Italian style of the past, lose then the archaeological features of that style and become completely modern": this lesson can be considered the summary of all Berlam's works between 1880 and 1920, when he died.
From 1905 his son Arduino actively contributed to his father's works.
One notable building designed by Berlam today in his home city is the Synagogue of Trieste.

Victimless Leather – a prototype of a stitch-less jacket, grown from cell cultures into a layer of tissue supported by a coat shaped polymer layer.
This is a sub-project of the Tissue Culture & Art Project where the artists are growing a leather jacket without killing any animals. Growing the victimless leather problematizes the concept of garment by making it semi-living. This artistic grown garment is intended to confront people with the moral implications of wearing parts of dead animals for protective and aesthetic reasons and confronts notions of relationships with manipulated living systems.
Tissue Culture & Art Project
The SymbioticA website explains what it is, "an artistic laboratory dedicated to the research, learning, critique and hands-on engagement with the life sciences.". The artists work with tissue, constructing and growing complex organisms that can live outside the body, making the new objects semi-living. Their projects are meant to question life, identity and the relationship between humans and other living beings and environments. They are also interested in the ethics around partial life and the possibilities around this type of technology in the future.
Other projects
These are some of the sub-projects that are also part of the TC&A project, in addition to Victimless Leather:
NoArk – NoArk is a collection of cells and tissue from many different organisms, growing together inside a "vessel", a reference to Noah's Ark. The project website states that NoArk is "a tangible as well as symbolic ‘craft' for observing and understanding a biology that combines the familiar with the other".
Worry Dolls – Seven modern versions of the Guatemalan Worry doll were hand-crafted of degradable polymers and surgical sutures and seeded with skin, muscle and bone tissue. The tissue was then allowed to grow inside a bioreactor, replacing the polymers as it degrades, thus creating seven semi-living dolls.
Disembodied Cuisine – Along with Victimless Leather, this is part of the "Victimless Utopia". The idea for this project was to take cells from a frog and grow them into something possible to eat, displaying it next to the still living frog the food came from. This problematizes the whole meat industry – how we kill animals to eat them. Growing tissue outside of the body of the animal is a way to "make" meat while the animal stays healthy and living.
Extra Ear – ¼ Scale – Using human tissue, a quarter-scale replica of artist Stelarc's ear was grown. The project wanted to confront the cultural perceptions of life now that we are able to manipulate living systems, and also discuss the notions of the wholeness of the body.
The Pig Wings Project – This project bases its ideas on xenotransplantation and genetically modifying pigs so their organs can be transplanted to humans. The artists used tissue engineering and stem cell technologies to grow pig bone tissue, forming three different sets of wings. One set shaped as bat wings ("evil"), one as bird wings ("good") and one as pterosaurs wings ("neutral").
The Idea
An aim for the "Victimless Leather" project is to explore and provoke scientific truths, using conceptual art projects to encourage better understanding of cultural ideas around scientific knowledge. The project website point out how clothing has always been used to protect the fragile skin of humans, but lately have evolved into a fabricated object used as a tool to show one's identity. Based on this, clothing can be explored as a tangible example of the relationship between humans and others, and how humans treat others. As the artists put it: "This particular project will deconstruct our cultural meaning of clothes as a second skin by materialising it and displaying it as an art object."
The intention to grow artificial leather without killing an animal is meant as a contribution to a cultural discussion between art, science and society. Making this jacket presents a possibility of wearing leather that is not part of a dead animal. The projects are presented in Workshops and exhibitions throughout the world to address ethical questions related to bioscience and technology. The artists want the project to be seen in this cultural context, not a commercial one. Their intention is not to create a consumer product, but to offer a starting point for the cultural discussion points mentioned above. As with most of the TC&A projects the artists are concerned with the relationship between humans and other living systems, both natural and scientific made or manipulated.
The Victimless Leather project
Growing the jacket
The artists wanted to make a leather-like material using living tissue, and ended up making it in the shape of a stitchless jacket. The artists based the jacket on a biodegradable polymer, coated it with 3T3 mouse cells to form connective tissue and topped it up with human bone cells in order to create a stronger skin layer.
To create the victimless leather, the team needed an artificial environment where semi-living entities are grown, so it is grown inside a bioreactor that acts as a surrogate body. The bioreactor used in this project was custom made, based on an organ perfusion pump designed by Alexis Carrel and Charles Lindbergh. It has an automatic dripping system which feeds the cells. The artists assumed that when the polymer degraded, an integrated jacket would appear. The resulting jacket was tiny, about 2 inches high and 1,4 inches wide and would just fit a mouse.
To idealize the "victimless" of the jacket, immortalized cell lines or cells that divide and multiply forever once they are removed from an animal or human host forming a renewable resource, have been used in the project. The 3T3 mouse cells all come from a mouse who lived in the 1970s.
Research and development
The research and development of “Victimless Leather” has been conducted in SymbioticA: the Art and Science Collaborative Research Laboratory, School of Anatomy and Human Biology at the University of Western Australia and in consultation with Professor Arunasalam Dharmarajan from the School of Anatomy and Human Biology as well as Verigen, a Perth-based company that specializes in tissue engineered cartilage for clinical applications. Western Australia state made the investment in the project through ArtsWa in Association with the Lotteries Commission.
Exhibitions
From a list of selected TC&A exhibitions.
Killing the Jacket
The victimless leather was featured in the exhibition “Design and the Elastic Mind” at The Museum of Modern Art in New York City, United States. February 24 – May 12, 2008 The project was scheduled to grow continuously until May 12 when the exhibition ended. There were some problems though, when the leather started expanding too quickly, clogging tubes inside the bioreactor. The exhibition leader therefore decided to unplug the project before the end of the exhibition – in a way, killing it.
Response
Because the artificial leather is made semi-living, the project might be seen as speculative and provocative to some people – questioning whether it is better to kill semi-living beings rather than living beings. "One of the most common and somewhat surprising comments we heard was that people were disturbed by our ethics of using living cells to grow living fabric, while the use of leather obtained from animals seems to be accepted without any concern for the well-being of the animals from which the skin has been removed." artist Ionat Zurr uttered after showing the jacket to the public on "The Space Between" exhibition in Australia.

Related work and ideas
The project also focuses on human consumption, highlighting that there are victims on every level of it, and that the boundaries between harm and benefit often are blurred. The French actress Brigitte Bardot strongly opposed hunting of animals for vanity and the commercial purpose of the skin. From an indigenous point of view, the context must be seen different. An Inuit hunts the seal and uses the whole body of the animal as a basic resource for his survival.
Similar to ethics like this, is the interest for artificial meat production due to reactions against the livestock sector because of health and environmental problems. A 2006 UN Food and Agriculture Organization FAO report pointed out the livestock sector as one of the most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems like soil degradation and water pollution. And because of methane, it spews out more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than transportation.

"Ice in the Sunshine" is a song by German pop group Beagle Music Ltd. Initially composed and recorded as a jingle for a 1985 Langnese cinema commercial, it gained massive popularity after its screenings and was subsequently released as a single in Germany in 1986, reaching the top ten. Lead vocals of the original jingle were done by Ian Cussick. The recordings for the single release feature a different singer.
In the 2000s, the song was revitalized when America singer Anastacia re-recorded the track for another Langnese commercial. It has since been covered by several artists for promotion, including No Angels, DJ Tomekk, Shaggy and The Bosshoss.

Riems is an island in the southwestern part of the Bay of Greifswald, a broad, shallow embayment of the Baltic Sea between the German mainland and the island of Rügen. Riem belongs administratively to the urban district of Greifswald, but is an exclave. Riemserort is municipally part of Riems, but lies opposite the island on the mainland.
Geography
The island of Riems measures about 1,250 metres from east to west, and is about 300 metres across at its widest point. Since the early 1970s, it has been connected to the mainland by a 500m long causeway. It has, therefore, been an artificial peninsula for more than 30 years. Before the causeway, a cable car used to transport goods to the mainland. The cable car has now gone, but the ruins of its pylon foundations are still visible. Because the lack of fresh water to the Gristower Wiek resulted in oxygen depletion in the shallow bay, in the autumn of 2007 a 30-metre-long section of the causeway to the island was opened and bridged to allow fresh water to pass once more.
Fauna
Riems is an important resting and moulting area for waterbirds. The Fahrenbrink Peninsula Nature Reserve () is a recognized reserve. Approximately 15 percent of the northern European waterfowl population spend their winter in the area of the Bay of Greifswald and the Strelasund. It has therefore been declared a European bird reserve.
History
Riem has been inhabited since prehistoric times as Stone Age and Slavic archaeological finds demonstrate. The island later belonged, together with the adjacent village of Gristow, to the family of Dotenberg. Between 1375 and 1382, Riems and Gristow became the possession of the city of Greifswald, which leased the then uninhabited island out as pasture land. After 1820, the city built a homestead but sold it back to its previous tenant in 1883.
Riems are home to the oldest virological research institution in the world, now called the Friedrich Loeffler Institute, which was built by Friedrich Loeffler in 1910. Loeffler, a professor at the University of Greifswald, ran filtration tests in 1898 and found that the dangerous foot-and-mouth disease was not a bacterium, but a previously unknown class he called "the smallest of all organisms". He had determined it to be a virus. After investigations showed that Loeffler had inadvertently infected the whole region of Greifswald with foot-and-mouth disease he moved to the safer location of his institute on the island of Riems in 1910.
The Third Reich used the institute in Riems to research bioweapons.
While East Germany controlled Riems approximately 800 people were working on vaccine research and development, today there are less than half that number. The population on the island is quite small. There are only 13 houses, five one- or two-family homes and eight apartment buildings, with a total of 62 residential units.
Since 1997, the research complex is the headquarters of the Riemser Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI). The duties of the FLI include research on animal diseases, such as Bovine spongiform encephalopathy, foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever, and the development of preventive and protective measures against it, especially veterinary vaccines. As of 2006, Riems was working on a vaccine for the avian flu. By 2010, the Institute was to reduce their current locations Tübingen, Wusterhausen and Jena to just Jena and Riems. The total budget for the expansion work is some 150 million €. The construction needed to be handled carefully because of the historically rich old buildings.
The former production plant for animal vaccines was successfully privatized as Riemser Arzneimittel AG. It has about 150 employees.
After the 1990s the populated area in the western part of the island was freely accessible for some years. However, because of the renewed research work with viruses the island is again closed to the public. Quarantine stables and laboratories security levels are level 4. This means employees and visitors to the complex must change their clothes, and shower, when entering and exiting.
