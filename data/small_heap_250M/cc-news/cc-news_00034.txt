Reigning dancehall queen Ebony, while performing her hit song ‘Sponsor' at the ‘Odadee Torch and Bonfire Night' at the Presbyterian Boys' Secondary School (PRESEC) in Accra, fell on stage.
Ebony, known as the ‘bad girl' of Ghana's music industry due to her provocative style of dressing coupled with her stage performances, narrowly escaped what could have been a fatal fall during her performance after she slipped and fell to her knee.
The 20-year-old singer immediately got up to continue her performance amidst cheers from her fans.
The ‘Odadee Torch and Bonfire Night' is an annual event for PRESEC old school reunion which serves as a networking and socialisation platform brought together alumni of the school to relive memories of their secondary school days.

Attorneys for Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens want to disqualify St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner from overseeing the governor's latest felony charge — and instead appoint a special prosecutor.
It stems from how Gardner has handled Greitens' other felony case for felony invasion of privacy.
Greitens was charged on Friday with felony tampering with computer data. He's accused of taking a fundraising list from The Mission Continues without the organization's permission — and using that information to raise money for his 2016 gubernatorial bid.
In a Monday filing, Greitens' attorney James Bennett wrote that the St. Louis Circuit Court should appoint a special prosecutor instead of Gardner. Among among other things, Bennett says that Gardner has a “personal motivation to justify the prior charges and conduct by bringing new charges, which the defendant believes to be unfounded.”
“It is improper for a prosecutor to have a personal interest in creating another prosecution to distract from the way a prior prosecution was handled,” the filing states.
The filing also states that Burlison told attorneys in a closed meeting that William Tisaby, an investigator that Gardner hired to interview witnesses in the felony invasion of privacy case, may have committed perjury. Greitens' attorneys wanted the invasion of privacy case thrown out after Tisaby allegedly made false statements during a deposition, including whether he took notes while interviewing witnesses.
“[Burlison] then explained to Ms. Gardner ‘the point still remains is that there is (sic) allegations that someone has to investigate,'” the filing states. “Without explaining the basis for her conclusions and acknowledging that other members of her staff had stated that Mr. Tisaby would be investigated, the circuit attorney responded ‘these are allegations that are unfounded.' It is very difficult to understand how any person could conclude that Mr. Tisaby told the truth in his depositions. Thus, the circuit attorney's support for Mr. Tisaby is difficult to understand.”
Gardner's response
In response, Gardner's office said in its filing that it “categorically rejects the claim that she is ‘interested' or vindictive, and the circuit attorney likewise disputes the reckless and unwarranted accusation of subornation of perjury.”
“Defendant's argument, if accepted, presents the very real prospect that courts will be called upon to appoint a special prosecutor in every case where the defendant has aggressively attacked the methods and conduct of the prosecutor in one case, to preclude the prosecution of other meritorious cases against that defendant,” the filing states.
The filing goes on to say that there is “simply is no realistic likelihood of vindictiveness when the prosecutor files an unrelated charge based on her own investigation and an investigation by the attorney general of the State.” That's a reference to how Attorney General Josh Hawley sent evidence to Gardner in the computer data tampering case.
“The defendant's motivation is transparent: he wishes to disable both the circuit attorney and the attorney general — the responsible elected officers charged with enforcement of the criminal laws — from proceeding on a criminal charge, in an obvious effort to delay the cause so as to deflect the General Assembly from pursuing its own agenda,” the filing states. “The court should not aid or abet this gambit.”
That line may be a reference to how Greitens' attorneys want any special prosecutor to be “outside and independent from” Hawley's office. Hawley called on Greitens to resign after a House report on the governor's conduct was released. Greitens' attorneys have requested a restraining order to prevent Hawley from any future legal involvement with the governor. A hearing on that request is set for Thursday in Cole County.
Greitens is facing the possibility of being impeached, especially after GOP House Speaker Todd Richardson called for the governor to step down. It only takes a majority of House members to impeach a governor — and then a panel of judges that the Senate selects decides whether that officeholder is removed.

Roasting a goose may be daunting, but if your goose is well cooked, it has succulent, tender, dark meat that is rich tasting, and free of fat. A fine roasted goose can be a feast for king and peasant alike, according to the French writer Honoré de Balzac. It certainly is a classic choice for Christmas dinner.
Roasting a goose is slightly different than roasting a chicken or turkey, so it's important to have a good recipe and an understanding of what to expect (plenty of precious goose fat to cook with, for one). Goose pairs well with various fruits and chestnuts, and the recipes below reflect that. Find one you like and go for the goose this holiday season.
Forget your fear of flabby, greasy goose with our roast goose recipe. This do-ahead method produces a succulent, flavorful bird with crispy skin. A poaching or steaming technique can be employed to render fat and par-cook the bird. In this recipe, after poaching, only a half-hour of high heat roasting is needed before serving.
We've been searching the internet for goose recipes, and one from Saveur for a Slovenian style stuffed goose got our attention. Served with handmade, shredded egg noodles – called mlinci – this is definitely something different.
You had us at Armagnac-soaked prunes. This recipe from Nadine Levy Redzepi (yes, she's the wife of René Redzepi) appears in the December issue of Food & Wine. She does most of the cooking in their home, and her new cookbook called Downtime details how the Redzepis dine day-to-day.
We're pleased to see that the Danes have a taste for Armagnac and prunes like we do (See our French Kisses). Try her inspired Goose Stuffed with Apples and Armagnac-Soaked Prunes for a taste of what the world's best chef might be eating this Christmas.

Speaking of prunes, Julia Child used them to stuff a goose (along with pork and chestnuts) in this recipe recreated by Kay Chun at Food & Wine. Research shows that Julia made this for Christmas dinner in 1970, but the recipe does not appear in any of her cookbooks. The stuffed goose recipe at Food & Wine was developed using Julia's goose recipes in Mastering the Art of French Cooking, and it looks like a keeper.
Are you serving goose this year? Have you roasted goose before? Tell us about your experiences right here, or on social media. Tag @dartagnanfoods on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter to talk about roasting goose or any other holiday food plans.
Only hours after Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee released a previously-classified memo alleging “abuses” in the FBI's use of government surveillance, FBI Director Chris Wray sent an internal video to employees of his agency, telling them that, “Talk is cheap,” and, “The work you do is what will endure.
Interested in Russia Investigation? Add Russia Investigation as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia Investigation news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest
"I wanted to take a moment to reach out in person, given all that's been going on as of late,” Wray said in the video message, described to ABC News by one FBI official." “You've all been through a lot in the past nine months, and I know it's often been unsettling, to say the least. And the past few days haven't done much to calm those waters.”
Wray continued: “Let me clear: I stand fully committed to our mission. I stand by our shared determination to do our work, independently and by the book. I stand with you, and while there's no shortage of opinions about us right now, nobody has the same vantage point on the FBI that I do.”
Earlier on Friday, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep.Devin Nunes, R-Calif., released a memo drafted by his own staff, accusing the FBI of inappropriately placing former Donald Trump adviser Carter Page under government surveillance.
The FBI conducted that surveillance based on what the memo called a “minimally corroborated” dossier alleging ties between President Donald Trump, his aides, and Russian operatives.
The secretive court that oversees such monitoring, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, first approved an application for the FBI to monitor Page's communications in October 2016 – before Trump was elected president.
The Justice Department continued the surveillance after Trump was elected, according to the memo.
The dossier was written by former British spy Christopher Steele, whose work was funded with money from the Democratic National Committee. Steele wanted to block Trump from becoming president, the memo alleged.
“While the [surveillance] application relied on Steele's past record of credible reporting on other unrelated matters, it ignored or concealed his anti-Trump financial and ideological motivations,” the memo said.
“Our findings … raise concerns with the legitimacy and legality of certain DOJ and FBI interactions with the” surveillance court, and “represent a troubling breakdown of legal processes established to protect the American people from abuses,” the memo read.
On Wednesday, after Wray reviewed the memo, the FBI issued a statement saying it has “grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy.”
Page first came onto the FBI radar several years ago, well before Trump announced his latest candidacy, because suspected Russian spies in New York City were overheard saying they wanted to recruit Page as an intelligence asset.
The suspected spies were later charged, but no charges were brought against Page.
In his video to FBI employees Friday, Wray said he is “continually inspired by what you do on a daily basis to keep people safe.”
“In the end, actions speak louder than words. That sounds simple, but there's real strength in remembering that,” Wray said. “The American people read the papers and they hear lots of talk on cable TV and social media. But they see and experience the actual work you do, keeping communities safe and our nation secure, often dealing with sensitive matters and making decisions under difficult circumstances. And that work will always matter more.”
An Irish citizen recently acquitted after four years of being imprisoned in Egypt says he saw dozens of cellmates become radicalized and adopt views of the Islamic State group during his brutal captivity in overcrowded jails.
Ibrahim Halawa, 21, was arrested after security forces broke up a 2013 sit-in protesting the army's overthrow of an elected Islamist president, and was released in October after being held in a half-dozen detention centers. His experience provides a unique perspective on how conditions inside Egypt's notorious prisons have degenerated during an unprecedented crackdown on dissent.
Born in the Dublin suburb of Crumlin to parents of Egyptian descent, Halawa had faced death by hanging on charges that ranged from inciting violence to murder, and says regular beatings with bars and metal chains during captivity led him and others to the brink of despair.
"In the beginning, no one had even heard of Daesh, but by the time I left, maybe 20 percent were openly supporting their ideas," he said, using the Arabic acronym for IS. "It could have been just talk — many of them were engineers, students and doctors who just wanted to get home to their families — but after all those years of being in jail with no explanation, much wanted revenge."
The extremist group boasts a powerful affiliate in Egypt's northern Sinai that has stepped up attacks in recent years, killing hundreds of security forces and civilians and expanding its reach to the mainland. Last month gunmen waving the group's black flag killed 300 people at a Sinai mosque in the deadliest terror attack ever carried out in the country.
Authorities have meanwhile waged a sweeping crackdown on dissent. Human rights groups say as many as 60,000 political prisoners are being held in Egyptian jails, mainly Islamist supporters of ousted President Mohammed Morsi but also several prominent secular activists.
Halawa said prison officials routinely described him and his cellmates as "political prisoners," even writing it on cells that were built to hold 10 men but were packed with dozens. The Egyptian government, which has branded Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood group a terror organization, denies holding any political prisoners.
"The prisons were packed — originally there were many members of the Muslim Brotherhood and April 6 (secular youth movement) but new people were always coming in," he said. "Toward the end, the guards became really rough with us because they saw people who left were returning still politicized, posting their views on Facebook."
Halawa was detained in the summer of 2013, just a few days after the army cleared out mass protests against the overthrow of Morsi, whose awkward one-year rule divided the country. Hundreds of protesters were killed.
Halawa and his sisters travelled regularly to Egypt for vacation, and had arrived that summer, just after he finished secondary school exams.
"I had no clue what was going on in Egypt at the time. I went to a few protests, including anti-Morsi ones, but everyone did back then, and I wanted to see all sides," he said. Only after friends were killed by the military did he accept an invitation to speak on stage at the main sit-in, where he said organizers were inviting anyone to address the crowd.
"The place was full of lots of simple people who were just against military rule, like farmers who earned ($50) a month. And at the stage, they were desperate for speakers, especially foreigners," he said.
Halawa's Egyptian-born parents urged him and his sisters to avoid the demonstrations, but their curiosity got the better of them, he said. His father, Hussein, is the imam for Ireland's largest Muslim community, in Dublin, and both he and Ibrahim insist they have nothing to do with the Brotherhood.
"Our relatives in Egypt aren't political at all, and everyone knows this — even the prosecutors and police never accused us of being a pro-Brotherhood family. My sisters and I, by going to a simple protest, were the most politically involved in the family," he said. Authorities released his three sisters after three months' detention.
Halawa says he had a typical Irish childhood, even playing Gaelic sports like hurling. But as a devout Muslim of Egyptian descent who looks older than his age, he was seen by authorities as a threat. When they found him sheltering in a mosque during street clashes, it confirmed their suspicions.
Despite speaking only rudimentary Arabic at the start of his sentence, he was treated as an Egyptian in prison, beginning with the customary welcome beating guards referred to as "the party."
"The food was often rotten, although I luckily got packages from the Irish Embassy," he said. "It was pretty corrupt in there, the guards could accuse anyone of anything and the charges would stick." Prisoners were often punished when high-profile attacks were carried out against the state over the years, such as the assassination of the prosecutor-general in 2015.
"When that happened they gave us a thorough 'inspection,' dumping out all our things in the middle of the cell and throwing food and water on it," he said. "They also made us stand under the sun all day sometimes, but other times when they tried to get information they'd offer me extra food."
Human rights groups say torture and other abuses are rampant in Egyptian prisons. Egyptian officials deny any systematic abuse and say individuals are held accountable for any violations.
Toward the end of Halawa's imprisonment, the Brotherhood — previously known for organizing inmates in detention — had lost much of its pull inside jail, he said, with only die-hards sticking with the group.
"Most people wanted nothing to do with them after four years, they just wanted to get out so they'd avoid associating with them," he said.
Halawa's case — a collective trial with nearly 500 defendants — began to be resolved only in March of this year, the first time he was allowed to come before a judge to declare his innocence. While most of the accused received sentences of between five years and life imprisonment, Halawa and some 50 others were declared innocent. He was released on Oct. 18 and returned home.
Now he hopes to finally begin his studies in computer science and business, and get on with his life. Grateful for the sustained support of human rights organizations and the Irish government, he also wants to campaign for the unjustly detained, especially his countrymen.
"There are plenty of people out there imprisoned like I was for no reason, so I'd like to help."

CAIRO (AP) — Yemen's official news agency says the Shiite rebels have killed at least 20 people and detained dozens across the country's north since killing their top ally, former President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
The rebels known as Houthis appear to be escalating their crackdown on any possible sign of rebellion among their one-time allies from Saleh's party, the General People's Congress. They are also shutting down the internet and tightening an already existing media blackout.
According to SABA, the official news agency now under control of the internationally-recognized government, the Houthis also blew up 20 houses in the northern province of Hajja and replaced the province's governor who was a onetime Saleh associate.
The agency reported on Monday that the Houthis also arrested 49 people in Mahwet, another northern province in Yemen.
A Main Street Bethlehem furniture home decor store is relocating to the South Side to expand its showroom and join the burgeoning arts district.
Initially an online retailer, Domaci in May 2016 opened its first brick-and-mortar shop at 523 Main St.
The store's owners, Derrick and Warren Clark, announced Monday they plan to move in January to the former Cleo's Silversmith Studio and Gallery, 21 E. Third St. Cleo's closed earlier this year when longtime owner Cleo Smith retired.
"We've been watching the growth and redevelopment that's been going on in the arts district, and we're eager to be part of the South Side revival," Derrick Clark said in a news release.
It's a loss for Bethlehem's Main Street, where downtown merchants have put an emphasis on attracting more retail over new restaurants in hopes of keeping feet on the street throughout the day.
But its a gain for the South Side which is in the midst of a revival and construction boom. Cleo's was one of the first businesses to take a bet on the neighborhood 20 years ago. The store's closure left a large vacancy in the Third Street corridor.
New market, cafe planned for Bethlehem neighborhood
The new storefront is nearly three times larger than Domaci's current space, which opens up many new opportunities, Derrick Clark said.
"We will be able to host more in-store events and introduce some exciting product lines and initiatives that we simply didn't have the space for on Main Street," he said.
The Clarks launched Domaci in 2015 as an online-only furniture retailer specializing in sustainably-sourced solid-wood furnishing and unique homewares and gifts, like t-shirts with Musikfest mug graphics or Bethlehem pennants.
Shoppers will find the same "mix of old and new, and unique and stylish decor that customers have come to expect and love," the release states. The store plans to add a design bar where customers can work with the in-house designers on their projects and design custom furniture, including live-edge pieces.
But the move will allow Domaci to expand its locally-made products from their Domaci Makers, like Rustik Rehab which specializes in turning reclaimed and salvaged wood into custom furniture pieces and decor.
The extra space will allow Domaci to add in new vendors, some who have been basically unavailable in the Lehigh Valley area, the release states.

The Trump administration has been taking its time coming up with a response to the nation's ongoing opioid epidemic since declaring a national emergency in August 2017. One of President Trump's big talking points has been giving drug dealers the death penalty, despite no evidence that the death penalty is a deterrent to criminal activity, and the fact that President Trump likely got the idea from the regime of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte. Despite the criticism from both abuse and criminal justice experts, and little support thus far from Congress, President Trump is not backing off.
Speaking at an event in Manchester, New Hampshire — a state that has been hit particularly hard by the opioid epidemic — he unveiled the administration's opioid response plan, which includes the death penalty for some drug dealers as well as tougher sentencing laws. “We're wasting our time” if we don't get tough with drug dealers, Trump said, “and that toughness includes the death penalty.”
Trump added that he didn't want to have America facing this problem in seven years, presumably when he leaves office. During his speech, he declared that this would be done in a number of ways, including “not so addictive” painkillers, and “great commercials” during “the right shows” that demonstrate to children “how bad” drugs are. “And we'll make them very, very bad commercials…unsavory situations,” the president said.
While the event eventually morphed into a miniature campaign rally in the battleground state, the administration released details of the plan to the public. Some experts noted some of the relatively popular proposals included, but countered that it would be more prudent to expand Medicaid and prescription drug coverage and ensure prisons have the resources to treat substance abuse and addiction among their inmates.

PHOENIX (AP) -- Joshua Braun scored 14 points to help spark Grand Canyon's wire-to-wire, 89-55 rout of Chicago State in a Western Athletic Conference contest Saturday night.
Chicago State has now lost 19 straight.
Grand Canyon opened the game with back-to-back-to-back 3-pointers by Alessandro Lever, Casey Benson and Braun and never trailed. By halftime, the Antelopes led 36-27. Benson hit a layup and followed it with a 3 to push the lead to 46-27 barely two minutes into the second half. Grand Canyon finished with 11 3-pointers on 27 attempts (40.7 percent).
Grand Canyon (17-7, 6-2) had its four-game win streak snapped by Utah Valley and the Lopes now have won back-to-back games.
Oscar Frayer had 12 points and Keonta Vernon added 10 points and grabbed eight rebounds for the Antelopes, who had 15 players see action and 13 figures in the scoring.
Glen Burns scored 12 points to lead Chicago State (2-23, 0-8).

FILE - In this Oct. 24, 2016 file photo, the HealthCare.gov 2017 website home page is seen in Washington. On its very first day, the new Congress plans to take initial steps toward repealing President Barack Obama's health care law. That would accomplish two things: Showing GOP stalwarts they're serious about shipping repeal legislation to new President Donald Trump, and postponing divisive decisions about how to replace Obama's law and cover some 20 million Americans until later. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)
WASHINGTON (AP) — The stakes confronting Republicans determined to dismantle President Barack Obama's health care law were evident in one recent encounter between an Ohio congressman and a constituent.
"He said, 'Now you guys own it. Now fix it. It's on your watch now,'" recalled GOP Rep. Pat Tiberi, chairman of a pivotal health subcommittee. "And this is a supporter."
Republicans have unanimously opposed Obama's law since Democrats muscled it through Congress in 2010. They've tried derailing it scores of times but have failed, stymied by internal divisions and Obama's veto power.
With the Republicans controlling Congress and Donald Trump entering the White House on Jan. 20, their mantra of repeal and replace is now a top-tier goal that the party's voters fully expect them to achieve — starting this week.
But by unwinding the statute, the GOP would kill or recast programs that provide coverage to 20 million Americans who will be wary of anyone threatening their health insurance. And continuing Republican rifts over how to reshape the law, pay for the replacement and avoid destabilizing health insurance markets mean party leaders have a bumpy path ahead.
___
Q: What's first?
A: When the new Congress convenes Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said his chamber will begin debating a bare-bones budget for next year. Most significantly, that would trigger a special procedure letting Republicans repeal much of Obama's law by a simple Senate majority.
That's big because GOP senators will have only a 52-48 edge. The debate will also be a way for Republicans to signal quickly to voters that they're starting to erase the law, even as they save actually doing it for later.
___
Q: And then?
A: Lawmakers will work on legislation actually repealing much of Obama's law.
The legislation is likely to erase the mandate that people buy insurance or face hefty IRS fines, which Republicans despise. Also facing elimination or reductions: taxes Obama imposed on upper-income people to finance the law, subsidies that help millions afford health care and the expansion of Medicaid health coverage to more lower-earning people. Federal aid to Planned Parenthood would be halted, reflecting GOP opposition to the right to abortion, one of the women's health services provided by the organization.
They hope to pass the bill by late spring, but its provisions probably won't take effect for up to four years to give lawmakers time to craft a replacement.
This won't be easy. Many congressional Republicans are from states like Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania that have added about 10 million people to Medicaid and will oppose abandoning so many voters. Others will be nervous about voting to repeal the overall law without having replacement legislation to show constituents.
Republicans also worry that during the transition to a new system, health insurers — already struggling in some states — might protect themselves by leaving some markets and boosting premiums. To ease that, GOP aides say they're considering including some kind of stabilization fund in the repeal bill to protect insurers against losses. That remains a work in progress.
___
Q: Will the 20 million people now covered lose their benefits?
A: Some probably will, a byproduct of reducing Medicaid coverage and dropping the requirement that individuals buy insurance.
That could be partly offset by some who'd purchase less expensive policies because the bill will probably let insurers drop coverage for some of the 10 services they now must provide, such as outpatient care and pregnancies.
At a briefing for reporters, top House GOP aides said the goal is "universal access" to health benefits, as opposed to aiming for coverage of all Americans. They said Obama's law ended up with many policies that are too expensive and offer limited access to doctors, but the shift in focus to "access" suggests Republicans don't want to be measured by the number of people actually covered.
The Senate's new minority leader, Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said recently that repealing Obama's law without a replacement would mean "huge calamity from one end of America to the other."
House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, called claims that 20 million people will lose coverage a "big lie." He said Republicans will provide "an adequate transition period to give people piece of mind."
Cousins has also, like it or not, dived right into the extraordinary expectations surrounding the Vikings following their advancement to the NFC championship game last season. The junior-high kids were yet another reminder of this.
"Most of the questions revolved around, 'Will we go to the Super Bowl?' and 'Will we make the playoffs?' I just throw it back at them saying, 'Do you think we will?' and they say, 'Yes'. They're confident, and that's a good place to start."
As the Vikings worked through their fifth of nine formal spring practices labeled by NFL parlance as organized team activities, outside linebacker Anthony Barr was back on the field with the team after an absence last week he confirmed was related to his contract status.
Now playing the final season of his rookie contract at a fully guaranteed salary of slightly more than $12.3 million, Barr said he hoped to have a new deal in place before the on-field workouts began. That didn't happen, so he took out an insurance policy to protect his future earnings in case of injury in 2018.
The issue for Barr and his desire for longer-term security is the Vikings also have hefty paydays looming for wide receiver Stefon Diggs and defensive end Danielle Hunter, who are also playing this season on expiring contracts for a team that has plenty of expensive stars.
"My agent is doing a great job, and they're having conversations," said Barr, who was the team's first-round draft pick in 2014. "I don't know too many details on that. My focus is here with the team and getting better."
Sounds a little like the quarterback, dealing with his challenge of taking over a championship-chasing team.
"Everything is new, so I'm just continuing to try to get to where the plays and the reads and the terminology are all instinctual without having to think," Cousins said. "That takes a long time, but every day you can take a step in that process."

(KGTV and KESQ) - The Santee attorney who was rescued after a fall in Joshua Tree National Park is speaking about the experience.
Paul Hanks drove to the park to hike on his 54th birthday last week. He had intended to spend half a day ‘bouldering' before returning home.
Hanks' plans took a painful turn when he slipped and fell about 20 feet, injuring his leg.
“It happened. I slipped and it was just, having not slipped in 45 years, it was instant and total shock,” Hanks said.
RELATED: Family details how hiker stayed alive in Joshua Tree
Hanks crawled for miles, yelling for help. Eventually he settled under a Joshua Tree for the night, hoping he could throw some loose dirt on himself for warmth. Hanks quickly ran out of food and supplies.
“By the very first night, I was drinking my own urine. I had drank all of the water in my bottle and was refilling my bottle with my own urine.”
Hanks said the decision saved his life. He later found rainwater to drink and ate a cactus.
“It gave me some physical energy and it gave me some hope and it made me believe this is giving me the 24 hours I'm looking for,” said Hanks.
On Hanks' fifth day in the park, search and rescue teams found him.
“These three angels appeared out of nowhere and I was... I was shocked,” Hanks said. “I just couldn't believe it. I didn't want to say I had given up. Multiple times I had written myself off as dead. That I was never going to see another human being again and they showed up.”
The rescue team gave Hanks Gatorade and took him to safety.
Hanks are being treated at Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs. Family members say he'll have several surgeries for fractures on his leg, heel, forehead and pelvis. Hanks are expected to make a full recovery.
Chimamanda Will Lead Women to ‘Hell' – By Fredrick Nwabufo
Who made Chimamanda Adichie the supremo of feminism? Who made her the feminist papal? How did she become the feminist potentate?
By asking Hilary Clinton, former US presidential candidate, why her Twitter bio starts with “wife', Chimamanda has not only intruded into the personal business of Clinton, but also scorned a key principle of feminism – “choice”.
Besides other leanings, feminism entails freedom of choice. A woman is at liberty to be anything she wants to be – doctor, lawyer, housewife or mother. The right to choose is principal, and this should not be prejudiced.
Setting straightjacket standards and rules, which Chimamanda's brand of feminism promotes, will result in a second captivity – by matriarchal she-lords.
Notable feminists of the first and second waves such as Betty Friedan, author of ‘The Feminine Mystique', emphasised the essence of “choice” in their works; that a woman can be a housewife or a career person if she chooses to. The key word here is “chooses”.
The imposition of personal foibles on the feminist struggle gives it a blemished complexion. The result of this is the ridiculing of women who choose to be mothers or housewives by their so-called “woke” peers.
As a matter of fact, Chimamanda's brand of feminism makes a caricature of the movement's goal – equality of gender. How? Chimamanda's virulent feminism, by default, teaches all women are not equal – the housewife is less of a woman and in shackles, while the stiletto-wearing career woman is the archetypal vanquisher of the demonic patriarchal order.
In all, it is still “woke” if a woman chooses “wife” as her title. It is all a matter of choice. Personally, I believe “father” is an esteemed title. Nursing my six-year-old son from infancy has been the most rewarding duty for me. Yes, I am a father first.
In conclusion, Chimamanda's feminism is already leading some women to the hell of confusion, bitterness and misandry. Feminism should be defined by all women in different stations, according to their realities and choice, not by some self-installed matriarchal potentates.

A few years ago TiVo rolled out SkipMode for its DVRs that would allow viewers to jump past ads (on certain prime-time programs) with the press of a button. This year, for Super Bowl LII it's flipping the technology around with GameSkip that works favor of people who watch the game just to see all of those (incredibly expensive) advertisements. Sure, you can usually see the best ones on YouTube either before the game or immediately after they are, but for dedicated fans of everything except Eagles vs. Patriots, it could be an easy way to catch up.

HeresJohnny: Antifa is mostly street people in certain cities who take advantage of a opportunity to riot, but another core group are people who are paid to go "protest". Those are the ones with the masks on to conceal their identity [because they go from place to "protest"]. They attract some locals though so it makes them look organic, but it is a mostly paid group who drive from place to place and cause trouble. Another obvious clue to this, is they were throwing bricks at people at Charlottesville and they all had pepper spray with them - thats the antifa MO for "weapons", that and flag poles. The media has been giving this group a complete pass for nearly two years now. They also showed up at Trump rallies constantly and assaulted people/attempted to provoke fights [which the media would blame on Trump, and they did do that]. There most likely is a heavy DNC hand in their funding and thats why the Democrats dont want to condemn this group, they are doing their dirty work for them.
Taylor Swift took a jaunt to the U.K. this past weekend, a process she may or may not be very familiar with already. But on Sunday (May 27) she appeared at the BBC's Biggest Weekend festival in Swansea, Wales—not the sort of place that ordinarily sees much of Taylor Swift—where she graced the crowd with a six-song set ambitiously scheduled in between U.S. dates of her Reputation tour (and, tellingly, ahead of the U.K. ones).
Swift operates at an echelon of stardom that almost never requires her to give unscripted remarks at the spur of the moment. Her privacy is so carefully managed that the idea she might periodically disappear on private flights to another country seems entirely plausible. But because Biggest Weekend is a BBC festival, the entire event was recorded for broadcast. As Swift stepped offstage after her performance, she met Radio 1's Greg James for her first on-camera interview in two years. The weather was reportedly humid. Swift was wearing long sleeves. She looked… a little sweaty. It would have been weird if she wasn't.

“TS has a great sense of humour and we have known each other for ages and had a good catch up after the interview,” James wrote in a since-deleted tweet. “It's all cool. It was hot up there. I almost said we should both go for a shower but after this reaction I'm glad I didn't!”
Taylor Swift sometimes sweats. Greg James almost said something even more awkward… Is this news?

WASHINGTON — The State Department says it has received “a handful of reports” from American citizens who say they've experienced symptoms similar to those in attacks of U.S. government workers in Havana. But the U.S. isn't vouching for those reports.
The United States last week issued a travel warning that urges American travellers to stay away from Cuba. The warning said attacks on government personnel have occurred in Havana hotels and the U.S. can't make sure that Americans who stay at hotels wouldn't be harmed.
A State Department official says in the days following the travel warning, some citizens reported having similar symptoms after travelling to Cuba. The official says the U.S. government has “no way of verifying” whether they were harmed by the same attacks that have targeted government employees.
The official wasn't authorized to comment by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.
Catch Photos

Late summer and early fall fishing off the coast of Maine was fine all the way around. Pollack were big offshore with a good amount of haddock caught as well. Sizeable monkfish and halibut were hauled in on the Nor'easter, and shark, whale and tuna sightings were frequent. Inshore stripers were steady and plentiful too.
And that's O.K. Just pull over, get out of the car and look around. An eclipse is the ultimate democratic experience. Permission is not required. As Bob Dylan once sang, “But for the sky there are no fences facing.”
Photo
You don't need an astronomer to know whether the sun glows (or does not). Nor do you need any special equipment. If you don't have those special eclipse sunglasses, make a pinhole camera with your fist and see an image of the sun on the ground as it is eaten away by the moon.
The whole show, for those privileged to make it to the hallowed ground, will last about two hours, from the time the moon first bites into the sun (“first contact,” in astronomical jargon) until the sun is finally whole again (“fourth contact”).
At first, nothing dramatic will happen. Half a sun, or even a quarter, is still daylight, after all. You won't notice the sun shrinking unless you have special glasses or you're carrying a pinhole camera.
If you are under a tree, the gaps between the leaves may serve as pinholes. When you look down, you may see the ground carpeted with crescent suns.
It's when the crescent gets small that things start getting weird. Shadows sharpen drastically. The landscape is bathed in a melancholy banana light.
Then it all happens too fast. If you are in a high place looking west, you might see the moon's shadow approaching. Regulus, the brightest star in Leo, will step out of a robe of sudden twilight over the sun's shoulder. Mercury, Mars and Venus will pop out of the deepening gloom.

The last glimpse of sunlight as it disappears behind the moon looks like a diamond ring. And then, suddenly, the corona is there.
You always knew it was there, a hidden vibration in your soul, the intuition of something unseen, a mandala meaning whatever you want it to mean. But you couldn't perceive it.
This moment — “second contact,” by the way — is a good time to scream.
I first experienced this weirdness between goal posts on a soccer field in Siberia in 1968, where a colleague and I had ventured to record an eclipse that lasted only 35 seconds.

We brought with us a camera from the esteemed Harvard astronomer Donald Menzel, who couldn't make the trip. We recruited a Russian astronomer to run it.
Afterward, it was my job to deliver the film to Dr. Menzel's graduate student, a young astronomer named Jay Pasachoff.
It began a long acquaintance with Dr. Pasachoff, now one of the leading eclipse astronomers in the world. The man is driven by the mystery of the corona, which is only a millionth as bright as the sun's surface yet more than a million degrees hotter.
In 1983, a photographer and I crashed a National Science Foundation expedition to a place called Frog Point, on the island of Java, where Dr. Pasachoff's team was set up to record an eclipse.
We had an excuse because a friend of mine, Dennis di Cicco, then an editor at Sky & Telescope and a renowned astrophotographer, had been summoned all the way from Cambridge, Mass., to bring Dr. Pasachoff an important filter.
Willie Nelson is blaming Utah's high altitude for forcing him to cut a performance near Salt Lake City short.
Nelson ended his show early at the USANA Amphitheatre in suburban West Valley City on Sunday night.
He later apologized in a statement posted to his Twitter and Facebook accounts. The 84-year-old country music legend explained: "The altitude got to me. I am feeling better now and headed for lower ground."
Nelson's publicist didn't immediately respond to a request for further comment Monday.
Nelson was forced to cancel several concerts earlier this year because of what his publicist said was a bad cold.

Books of The Times A New Biography Traces Tiger Woods's Mythical Rise and Fall Image Credit Sonny Figueroa/The New York Times
There have been many biographies of Tiger Woods, and surely there will be many more. Some are friendly and shyly philosophical, like David Owen's early “The Chosen One,” from 2001. Others are curmudgeonly and expert about golf, like Tom Callahan's “His Father's Son” (2010).
Amid these books, “Tiger Woods,” the new biography from Jeff Benedict and Armen Keteyian, rides in as if on 18 wheels, for better and only occasionally worse. It's a confident and substantial book that's nearly as sleek as a Christopher Nolan movie. It makes a sweet sound, like a well-struck golf ball.
I found it exhilarating, depressing, tawdry and moving in almost equal measure. It's a big American story that rolls across barbered lawns and then leaves you stranded in some all-night Sam's Club of the soul. It reminded me of a line from Martin Amis's new book of essays: “How drunk was Scott Fitzgerald when he said there were no second acts in American lives?”
The authors have hoovered up everything there is to be learned from previous writing about Woods, and then interviewed more than 250 people on their own. (They declined to interview Woods after he set draconian conditions.) They bring grainy new detail to almost every aspect of Woods's life.
Better, they have a knack for scene-setting. They tuck us inside Woods's private plane as the desert gives way to Las Vegas's megaresorts to open a chapter about Woods's exploits in that city, sometimes with Michael Jordan or Charles Barkley in tow. They refresh old stories by telling them from new angles.
Image Armen Keteyian Credit John P. Filo/CBS
This biography begins the only way it probably could have: with the car accident at Woods's home on the day after Thanksgiving in 2009 that precipitated his steep fall from grace. He groggily ran over hedges and curbs and smashed into a fire hydrant after his wife, Elin, who had learned of his adultery, apparently smashed his S.U.V. windows with a golf club.
At the time, Elin didn't know the half of it. Woods's paramours (strippers, waitresses, neighbors) began popping up from behind every swizzle stick. The scandal was on the cover of The New York Post for 21 consecutive days; each issue was so sleazy you wanted to pick it up with tongs. (The Sept. 11 attacks, by contrast, managed only 20 straight covers.) This was a purge of schadenfreude. Many were delighted to see this ostensible paragon of virtue take a fall.
Woods, the greatest athlete of our time, has not won a major tournament since. But he is healthy and playing well and has his sights on the Masters in a few weeks. This story might easily have another twist.
Benedict is a writer for Sports Illustrated. Keteyian is a CBS News correspondent. Together they are the authors of a previous book, “The System: The Glory and Scandal of Big-Time College Football” (2013).
In “Tiger Woods” they take special aim at Woods's parents, especially Earl Woods, Tiger's father. They raised a champion. They also raised a narcissistic loner who lacked basic decency. “Even the most basic human civilities — a simple hello or thank you — routinely went missing from his vocabulary. A nod was too much to expect.”
This book is littered with the bodies of those Woods cut out of his life without a thank you or goodbye — girlfriends, coaches, agents, caddies. If you stripped most of the golf out of this book, you might sometimes think you are reading the biography of a sociopath, a nonmurderous Tom Ripley or Patrick Bateman or Svidrigailov from “Crime and Punishment.”
Earl Woods, the worst kind of stage father, profited early and often from his son's career. He was a liar and an adulterer. The later years of his life were particularly sordid. He hired multiple young women to attend to his needs.
Image Jeff Benedict Credit Jeffrey Shaw
“Pornography played steadily on the television,” the authors write. “Sex toys were stuffed in drawers, and sexual favors were performed at Earl's request. ‘It was a house of horrors,' recalled a former employee. ‘Every drawer. Every cabinet.'”
There is beauty and awe in this perfectly pitched biography, as we watch Woods's skills blossom. Woods was shy and nerdy in his first years of high school. No one knew of his golf exploits. The moment here in which an early girlfriend, Dina Gravell, watches him play for the first time is terrific. It's as if she's discovered that he's Harry Potter.
Lovely too is the scene the authors set when Woods win his first Masters. Woods looks up — at this tournament in which the first black man, Lee Elder, played in 1975 — and “witnesses the abundance of black people from the Augusta staff who had left their posts and assembled on the lawn and the veranda on the second floor.”
Many other details accrue. The authors tally up the lies Woods has told the media since he was young. There's little evidence, for example, that he was mugged while at Stanford as he claimed. They marshal evidence that suggests Woods took illegal performance-enhancing drugs. There is good writing here about agents and ad campaigns.
If this book has a flaw it may be that it's too confident. Reading it can be like watching one of those crime shows in which the bumper music ends with slamming car doors. The authors move about like a supersleuth Starsky and Hutch, or Tango and Cash, or Crockett and Tubbs. To be fair, a bit of wit and play are allowed to sneak in.
Who is Tiger Woods? The authors don't get to the bottom of that question, but does anyone really expect that they could? Woods himself doesn't appear to have a clue.
Whom the gods will destroy, Cyril Connelly said, they first call promising. This intense book gives us Woods's almost mythical rise and fall. It has torque and velocity, even when all of Woods's shots, on the course and off it, begin heading for the weeds.

A West Yorkshire Police spokesperson said: "As a result of the incident the victim was left with a broken jaw.
"Anyone who knows the male pictured or has information about the incident is asked to call police on 101 quoting crime reference 13180054326."

PHOENIX (AP) — Survivors of the 2011 mass shooting in Arizona at an event hosted by former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords say the recent attack on lawmakers at a congressional baseball practice in Virginia shows how vitriolic political discourse has become.
Ron Barber, who took over Giffords' seat in Congress, called for an end to the harsh rhetoric and personal attacks in politics. Other victims said the recent shooting reignited strong feelings about the need for gun control.
Giffords was holding a constituent event outside a grocery store in 2011 when gunman Jared Loughner opened fire, killing six people, including a federal judge and a 9-year-old girl, and shooting Giffords in the head, severely wounding her.
Wednesday's shooting happened in a similarly public place — a popular park and baseball complex in Alexandria, Virginia.
Nevada contractors feel like they're facing a wrecking ball in the 2017 Nevada Legislative Session.
Progress made in 2015 to make construction defect regulations more reasonable, according to the industry, could be dismantled by a pair of bills introduced in the 2017 session, Assembly Bill 462 and Senate Bill 450.
"If (the laws) revert back, it will kill the market," said Aaron West, CEO of Nevada Builders Alliance.
West noted in particular the need for workforce housing in the region, which is enjoying an economic boom.
The reforms of 2015 improved the market climate for developers to build condominiums, townhouses, and apartments priced so that lower incomes could afford them, West said.
Before 2015, Nevada laws regulating how housing defects were handled substantially increased the risk for the builder, especially for multifamily projects, which almost guaranteed a lawsuit, he said.
"The definition of defect was so lose, it wasn't based on industry standards, it was based on opinion," West said.
"Attorneys were going to homeowners saying 'we think you have an issue with your house. We'll represent you and you'll get some money.'"
Attorneys could go to the homeowners association, which could file a lawsuit on behalf of everyone and individual homeowners would have to opt out or automatically be a part of it.
It cost contractors millions of dollars and the cost of liability insurance skyrocketed, he said.
In a $30 million settlement, "attorneys would get $25 million and $5 million was divided among homeowners," West gave as an example. "But there was nothing in place to ensure anything went to repairs.
"It was a fundamentally flawed system. Contractors steered clear of multifamily construction."
For years, the builders fought for reforms, finally succeeding during the 2015 Legislative Session.
The reforms reduced the time to file a complaint from 10 to six years; removed the HOAs from being able to initiate litigation; and more clearly defined a defect.
The reforms opened the doors for more work force housing.
The changes in 2015 were a "reasonable reform to a difficult law," said Mark Turner, a principal with CC Builders. Defect litigation laws "in Nevada were the most difficult in the country, even more difficult than in California.
"Builders just opted to avoid that type of housing," he said.
That changed after the 2015 reforms took effect. Construction on multifamily projects increased significantly.
In mid-March, CC Builders broke ground on a 105-unit townhouse project in Carson City called Mills Landing..
The company would not have started the project without the reforms of 2015, Turner said.
Assembly Bill 462 and Senate Bill 450 could set construction back.
SB 450 awards attorneys' fees automatically in a successful lawsuit.
AB 450 dismantles the rest of the 2015 reforms.
West, Turner and others in the building industry feel the reforms weren't given a chance to work and to show that defects would be taken care without the harsh laws of the past.
"It's been in place two years and we haven't seen any negative affects," West said. "If anything, it's been positive. …
"Not one of (the legislators we've talked to) have said 'I was contacted by constituents that weren't able to get a defect fixed.' Not one. Just from a policy perspective, you'd think policy should be based on a need."
Even if the 2017 bills do not become law, the swift inclusion of the bills suggests the battle will need to be fought again in the next legislative session.
With the possibility that the reforms could be undone this year or in the future, some contractors are hesitant to move forward with plans to construct workforce housing.
"I don't want to go near that," Turner said of the potential for litigation presented by AB 462 and SB 450.
Even construction of the Mills Landing project could come to a halt.
"We're on the fence. We would lose money if we didn't move forward. But we could lose a lot more if (in a lawsuit)," he said.
Despite the uncertainty, construction is moving ahead for now.
"We're continuing because the ball is rolling. It's hard to pull back," he added.
Whether they take on new projects is more doubtful.
"For us, the risk of building entry level housing, workforce housing, are just too great." Tuner said.

Jason Linkins is a writer who covers American politics and the media. He previously served as a columnist for The Huffington Post in Washington, D.C.
At this point, it's hardly controversial to note that the average day in the never-not-making-news Trump presidency can often feel freighted with a week's worth of psychic burdens. And for the White House, this last fortnight in particular has been something of a season of struggle. On one end, you have another failure to repeal and replace Obamacare. On the other, there's a push for a tax reform package that's proving to be a heavier lift than one might have expected with the GOP controlling all the levers of power.
It's the same old story: President Donald Trump is failing to beat Washington at its own game—or at least failing to be the outsider dealmaker and pathbreaker he vowed to be on the campaign trail. As is his wont, Trump has dealt with these setbacks by deflecting his ire—as well as the starry-eyed attention of an eager press corps—onto enemies beyond the Beltway.
The media, of course, has taken its regular barrage of Trumpian rage; at this point, if Trump goes 24 hours without tweeting about “fake news” or the “lying media,” it's cause for concern over whether he's trapped himself in a broom closet. In recent days, Trump has padded out these outbursts, weighing in on the activism of black athletes and lobbing insults at North Korea's dodgy dictator, Kim Jong-un. But he's also found time to publicly spar with Puerto Rican citizens and their elected officials for all sorts of perceived faults and slights. All that effort has only earned him a media narrative in which his crass treatment of the beleaguered islanders has been front-and-centre on banner headlines and evening cable newscasts.
But then, something unexpected happened. In an interview with Fox News' Geraldo Rivera, Trump said, “We have to look at Puerto Rico's whole debt structure…They owe a lot of money to your friends on Wall Street and we're going to have to wipe that out.”
And suddenly, Trump was interesting again. Forgive Puerto Rico's debt? Why not?
Well, we mustn't get too far ahead of ourselves. If you want to talk about heavy lifts, few come heavier than than the island's burdensome debt crisis—a toxic mixture of public policy choices that have limited Puerto Rico's economic competitiveness while running up huge budget deficits and the teeming flocks of vulture investors who've circled in to pluck the carcass to the bone. With all these entanglements, there is—to put it charitably—no easy path to “wiping” it out, legislatively or otherwise.
Besides, while Trump may find it easy—even instinctual—to start spitballing about Puerto Rico's debt problem while free-associating on television with Geraldo, sooner or later the president was going to find himself in the company of one of the many advisors he imported from Wall Street, none of whom would greet the idea with friendly favour. Indeed, by Wednesday morning, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney was walking it back in the now-classic style of everyone who's ever debated whether to take Trump seriously or literally. “I would not take it word for word,” said Mulvaney. “We are not going to deal with the fundamental difficulties Puerto Rico had before the storm.”
If there's a striking thing about Mulvaney's comments, it's how freely he depicts his boss as passive and out-of-touch, his occasional original ideas easily kicked to the curb. This is Capitol Hill sclerosis distilled to its essence, yet another rebuke to the theory that Trump presented on the campaign trail: that, for all his coarse behaviour, he would take on a system that had gotten bogged down in the conventional thinking of insider suck-ups. But in reality, Trump has more or less been nothing more than a lethargic spectator to events, railing at the system only when it fails to deliver some bill—any bill, really—that he can sign in the Rose Garden for the sake of pocketing a win. He's spent more time in office reminiscing about how easy his past life was than he has bust the system, like he promised. And for all his talk about “draining the swamp”—and it's an open question whether that was sincere, given all the avenues to self-enrichment he's exploiting—it seems he's sunk deep into the bog.
If Trump wants this to change, he needs to ignore the words of his swamp-monster budget director. Puerto Rican debt forgiveness may be the best possible war for Trump to wage at this exact moment—and, perhaps, the last great test of his political reputation.
For starters, much of the legwork has already been done. That's great news for a president who doesn't like legwork; Trump would be wading into the issue at a moment when significant momentum behind debt forgiveness has already been amassed. As the Intercept's Kate Aronoff reported this week, “Ahead of Maria, the federally appointed fiscal oversight board now in control of Puerto Rico's finances had developed a plan that would wipe out 79 per cent of the island's annual debt payments, taking a massive chunk out of the payday hedge funds had been hoping to land from the island.” Now, the principal fight, currently playing out in U.S. District Court, is over who is going to take the larger haircut: Will it be the residents of the island or the bondholders themselves?
In his interview with Rivera, Trump never clarified who would be the intended beneficiary of his imagined debt “wipe-out.” But if his campaign promises are any guide (sure, sure, grain of salt and all that), this is precisely the sort of fight Trump said that he would pick—one in which he, as the billionaire class-traitor, would break the backs of Washington ditherers and Wall Street crooks. No other looming issue presents Trump with this opportunity to re-embrace his campaign's brand of populism with as much resonance, relevance, and attendant political benefit. As Politico's Marc Caputo put it, “If Trump delivers a wipeout of Puerto Rico's debt and a fix to the island, it would have a Nixon-goes-to-China feel.”
You might remember Nixon going to China as the 37th president's moment of cutting through the knot of conventional thinking. Or, as some might prefer to recall, as the one good thing the old crook ever did.
Well, if we can contemplate that sort of esteemed level of historical comparison, then it's also possible to imagine Trump being showered in many lesser kudos from all quarters if he goes all in on stabilizing Puerto Rico, as he waits for presidential historian Michael Beschloss to properly sort him among the Great Men. For all of the enmity that Trump has sown with the press, he likely knows that his media antagonists are, nevertheless, constantly searching for an opportunity to declare Trump to be “presidential.” He'd earn these pleasing headlines by coming out in favour of debt forgiveness. For that matter, he would also gain some temporary alliances with lawmakers on the left side of the aisle, which would in turn tick that “bipartisanship-slash-independent leader” box that's so important to Beltway touts.
And if Trump has made himself an enemy of Puerto Ricans—many of whom could, through displacement, become Florida swing-state voters in very short order—then there is no faster way for Trump to get himself out of arrears. Solving the debt problem is a pre-eminent issue for residents of Puerto Rico, as well as the island's state-side diaspora. All of the stick that Trump has taken for his hurricane response would likely turn to praise if he took up this cause. One can easily imagine that Hamilton playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda—who only recently condemned Trump to “hell” on Twitter—would be singing a different tune if Trump's White House was making debt forgiveness a daily issue.
Ultimately, the best reason to support some measure of debt forgiveness for Puerto Rico is that it is a helpful and just thing to do, especially in light of the crippling damage done by Hurricane Maria. Trump, of course, can't be relied upon to pursue such just arrangements for their own sake, but he has nevertheless stumbled onto one which offers him the opportunity to do what he says he loves to do: battle America's elites, disrupt Capitol Hill gridlock, and dominate his “haters.”
The truth is, Trump might not have a better opportunity lying ahead to prove that he can bring Washington and Wall Street to heel, using nothing more than the force of his personality and his outsider style, and after a series of high-profile busts in Congress, he alone has a chance to reverse the narrative before it ossifies. Naturally, he'll be risking some capital on a venture that may not succeed. But even if he merely champions a Puerto Rico debt wipe-out, he'll be seizing an issue with tremendous, media narrative-altering power.
In a way, putting Puerto Rico's fiscal house in order would be a great way for the president to drain some of the red from his own ledger. And after all, you'd think that someone with Trump's insight into the transformational power of discharging one's debts would know the positives of this play.

Scientists Sarah Sadavoy and Steven Stahler were studying the Perseus molecular cloud, packed with newly formed stars, to determine what percentage of stars like our sun form in pairs. (The young stars within Perseus are less than 4 million years old. Our sun, by comparison, is roughly 4.6 billion years old.) Their notion, that the majority of stars don't form as single stars, isn't new; the question is more about numbers. Just how many sunlike stars form as binaries?
To find the answer, the scientists used existing data from a survey of every star in the Perseus stellar nursery. They ran a series of statistical models that took into account the numbers of both single stars and binary stars within the cloud. What they discovered surprised them: It appears as though all sunlike stars initially form as wide binaries, with 500 AU between them (a distance 17 times that of Neptune to our sun). Over the first million years of the stars' lives, the systems either shrink into a truly binary system or break apart, like our sun and Nemesis.
But will we ever find our sun's lonely companion, Nemesis? It's unlikely. The press release states, in a melancholy fashion, "Based on this model, the sun's sibling most likely escaped and mixed with all the other stars in our region of the Milky Way galaxy, never to be seen again." While this study has fascinating implications for what we know about how stars are born, it also underlines the fact that there's still a lot left to learn about our own star; that's why NASA is launching the Parker Solar Probe, the first spacecraft to touch the sun's atmosphere, in 2018.
Curtis, Saine discuss NC redistricting plans
MATT CHAPMAN
Staff Writer
North Carolina legislators have until the end of the month to redraw the state's election district lines, after 28 districts were deemed unconstitutional by federal courts due to racial gerrymandering.
The current lines, drawn in 2011 with Republicans in control of the legislature, have been under scrutiny for years despite receiving preclearance from the United States Department of Justice under the leadership of former President Barack Obama. In 2013, a state court ruled in favor of the maps, a ruling that was upheld twice by the state Supreme Court.
The maps that have now been used to elect the North Carolina General Assembly on three occasions were ruled unconstitutional by a panel of three federal judges in August 2016, a finding that was affirmed by the United States Supreme Court in June. However, the Supreme Court denied an order from the lower court for an immediate special election in the state.
“I guess I would say that I do have some concerns about the way that this entire process has gone forward,” state Sen. David Curtis, a Denver Republican whose district includes Lincoln County, said. “The North Carolina Supreme Court and the Obama Department of Justice both said that the current maps were OK. Then, three liberal Democrats in Richmond decided that they were not and unfortunately those three liberal Democrats were all federal judges. It's just a bit troubling to me that three individuals can basically say that our Supreme Court is wrong and the Obama Justice Department is wrong.”
Curtis serves Senate District 44, which currently includes the entirety of Lincoln County as well as part of Iredell County and a small portion of Gaston County. While his is not one of the nine Senate districts drawn unconstitutionally, it's likely that Curtis will have to campaign to a different set of constituents in 2018.
“I suspect that District 44 will change, but I don't know exactly how it will be changed yet,” Curtis said. “They identified nine districts that were illegal and it's like a domino effect because once you change one district, every other district has to change as well. Even though they didn't say that the 44th District was illegal, I suspect that it will be changed in order to comply with the districts that they did determine were illegal.”
Lincoln County state Rep. Jason Saine, a Lincolnton Republican, is confident that his district will remain in tact. House District 97 is one of a handful of districts within the state that encompasses an entire county and only that one county.
“The Lincoln and Caldwell County House districts are actually Constitutionally correct in the way that they're drawn,” Saine said. “They encompass an entire county, which is how our North Carolina Constitution says it should be when possible, and then of course our population in Lincoln County is almost exactly the number designated for a state House district. Looking at how counties were clustered and how districts will have to be redrawn, western North Carolina won't really be impacted. Those districts won't be touched in the redrawing and that's really quite nice from a regional aspect because there won't be a lot of upheaval. Whether Republican or Democrat it's nice to have that continuity.”
Last week, North Carolina lawmakers adopted the rules that will be used to draw the new maps, which must be submitted prior to the Sept. 1 deadline set by the three federal judges. Those rules allow the legislators to consider past election results when drawing the new lines, while also permitting them to draw the map in such a way to protect incumbents. The rules prohibit the legislature from considering race while drawing the new map.
Republican legislators have also hired Tom Hofeller, the same political consultant who drew the current, unconstitutional map. Hofeller will receive at least $50,000 from the state to draw the new district lines, according a report by the News and Observer.
“This is my first experience with redistricting,” Saine said. “It's really been a process because of the court order. There's been a lot of back and forth between attorneys, trying to make sure that our legislative staff understood specifically what the court wanted to see in the redrawing of the districts. We've been identifying what districts that they felt were out of compliance and it's kind of a moving target because one court rules this way and the other makes a different decision. It's just part of the ebb and flow of the political process and this seems to be the new norm, particularly in a state like North Carolina that is so competitive.”
North Carolina's legislative leaders are hoping to have the new map drawn within the next two weeks.

On regular TV, 4,181,000 Fox viewers, peaking at 5,373,000, saw Mexico play Brazil, according to Nielsen -- numbers that are pretty great for not-exactly-soccer-mad America (though half of what Telemundo did). Soccer also drove more than half (55 percent) of Fox's 632 million streaming views for all sports in June. That means, despite a lot of hand-wringing when the US was eliminated from World Cup qualifying, the $200 Fox spent to get the 2018 World Cup rights now seems like a wise bet.
PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistan's military says a roadside bombing has killed at least two soldiers and wounded three in the country's northwestern tribal region that borders Afghanistan.
A military statement says that Wednesday's bombing took place in the Datta Khel area of North Waziristan.
It says the bomb exploded as a vehicle ferrying soldiers drove near it. The casualties were transported to a military hospital in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
The tribal region was a sanctuary for militants until several massive military operations claimed to have pushed them out of the safe havens. The army claims to have cleared the area but militants in North Waziristan sporadically strike back, targeting security forces.

Jerry Brown signed legislation, SB54, the statuary state bill, that extends protections statewide for immigrants living the United State illegally, Thursday, Oct. 5, 2017. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu,file)
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California Gov. Jerry Brown signed sanctuary state legislation Thursday that extends protections for immigrants living in the United States illegally — a move that gives the nation's most populous state another tool to fight President Donald Trump.
Brown's signature means that police will be barred from asking people about their immigration status or participating in federal immigration enforcement activities starting Jan. 1. Jail officials only will be allowed to transfer inmates to federal immigration authorities if they have been convicted of certain crimes.
"These are uncertain times for undocumented Californians and their families, and this bill strikes a balance that will protect public safety, while bringing a measure of comfort to those families who are now living in fear every day," Brown said in statement.
It was one of several immigration-focused bills that Brown signed Thursday, which was also the final day for young immigrants to renew their permits under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that protects them from deportation. Trump intends to end the program if Congress doesn't act on it.
California is home to an estimated 2.3 million immigrants without legal authorization.
The Trump administration said the sanctuary state bill will make California more dangerous.
The state "has now codified a commitment to returning criminal aliens back onto our streets, which undermines public safety, national security, and law enforcement," Devin O'Malley, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice, said in a statement.
The measure came in response to widespread fear in immigrant communities following Trump's election. He railed against immigrants in his campaign and promised to sharply ramp up the deportation of people living in the U.S. illegally.
Democrats hope blocking police from cooperating will limit the reach of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.
The bill "will put a large kink in Trump's perverse and inhumane deportation machine," Democratic Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon said at a press conference in Los Angeles celebrating the signing.
De Leon's bill cleared the Legislature with support only from Democrats. Republicans said it will protect criminals and make it harder for law enforcement to keep people safe.
The bill, SB54, originally would have severely restricted the authority of police officers to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. At Brown's insistence, it was scaled back to allow cooperation in jails.
Police and sheriff's officials, including jail officers, will still be able to work with federal immigration authorities if a person has been convicted of one of about 800 crimes, mostly felonies and misdemeanors that can be charged as felonies. But they will be barred from transferring immigrants to federal authorities if their rap sheet includes only minor offenses.
The changes convinced the California police chiefs association to drop its opposition, while sheriffs — elected officials who run jails — remained opposed. ICE Acting Director Thomas Homan has condemned the measure, saying California is prioritizing politics over public safety.
California's Democratic political leaders have enthusiastically battled Trump and his administration with lawsuits, legislation and fiery public rhetoric, particularly about immigration and the environment.
Among other things, the other bills signed Thursday by Brown will limit federal immigration authorities from entering schools and workplaces without warrants; prohibit landlords from reporting tenants to ICE; and stop local governments from contracting with for-profit companies and ICE to hold immigrants.
Some law enforcement officials say the impact of the sanctuary measure likely will be minimal because it bans immigration enforcement activities that few agencies participate in.
Immigrant rights advocates say it's important to codify restrictions with the force of law while adding new ones. For them, it's a rare victory during Trump's presidency.
The measure was dubbed a sanctuary state bill because it sought to expand so-called sanctuary city policies that have long been in place in some of California's biggest cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Brown, though, has resisted the label. In his signing statement, he noted the bill does not prohibit ICE from operating in California.
"They are free to use their own considerable resources to enforce federal immigration law in California," Brown wrote.
De Leon put it somewhat differently.
"It won't stop ICE from trolling our streets," he said.

A 25-year-old Chinamhora man appeared in court on Saturday accused of beating up his stepdaughter to death after ordering her to leave his house, together with her sibling.
Saul Marufu of Marufu village, Chief Chinamhora in Domboshava appeared before Harare magistrate Mr Elisha Singano and was remanded in custody to December 21. He is facing murder charges.The age of the deceased was not given.
Prosecutor Ms Linda Gadzikwa alleged that Marufu married Diana Kabasa, the deceased Ashley Munyurwa's mother and she brought two children from previous marriages.
The court heard that Marufu's mother did not approve of his relationship with Kabasa because of the children.
It is alleged that Marufu decided to keep the marriage a secret from his mother. Marufu was allegedly in the habit of assaulting the children in the absence of their mother, insisting that they leave and go to their respective fathers.
It is alleged that on October 28, Marufu was left in custody of the children while the mother went to look for part time jobs.
Marufu allegedly assaulted Ashley with an unknown object all over her body. On realising that he had injured the child, Marufu handed her over to a neighbour and asked the neighbour to tell the mother that she had fallen and got injured.
The neighbour observed that the child had a cut below the nose, lost a front tooth, had two scars above the waist and was bleeding through the mouth.
The court heard that when the mother arrived, she rushed the child to Makumbe Hospital, but was referred to Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals.
The child died on the way. A postmortem revealed that the child died of hepatic renal intestinal trauma, hypovotemic shock, marked abdominal and head trauma. The Herald

At this stage, the vast majority of trade discussions surrounding Kawhi Leonard have involved the Los Angeles Lakers. With talks seemingly stalled (at least to some degree) with the Lakers, though, other teams with the ability to make interesting offers have surfaced and that includes the Boston Celtics.
The Celtics are legitimate NBA title contenders and are currently listed as the Eastern Conference favorites by most odds-makers at this very early juncture. With that in mind, Boston is apparently quite interested in Leonard but, in short, they reportedly aren't willing to send any of their “core” players to San Antonio.
ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski appeared on SportsCenter (h/t Fred Katz of MassLive.com) and indicated that the Celtics have a list of five players that aren't currently available.
BENTONVILLE, Ark. — Wal­mart has shuffled its merchandising management ranks while eliminating some positions in its merchandising and replenishment divisions. At the same time, the retailer has unveiled new proposals to promote manufacturing in the United States.
The management changes are taking place in food, general merchandise and merchandising operations, and they were revealed in three internal memos issued in late July. Some of the changes are related to an initiative focused on Hispanic consumers, while others reflect structural changes within merchandising operations.
According to a memo issued by Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food for Walmart U.S., Shawn Baldwin, senior vice president and general merchandise manager for produce and global produce sourcing, will lead the Hispanic initiative. In 2012 Baldwin won the Sam Walton Entrepreneur of the Year award for his work in growing the fresh business within Sam's Club.
He is being replaced by Martin Mundo, senior vice president of operations, Southeast, for Walmart U.S. Mundo, who joined Walmart in 1994, held leadership positions in Argentina before joining Walmart U.S. in 2012.
In recognition of the growing importance of deli and bakery, Redfield said responsibility for those businesses will be split between Kerry Robinson and Tyler Lehr. Robinson had been responsible for both departments, but he will now concentrate on bakery alone as senior VP and GMM of bakery. Lehr, who had been VP of Win in Fresh, has been promoted to senior VP and GMM of deli services. He is being succeeded by Marc Lieberman, VP of Neighborhood Markets.
Other changes in food merchandising include the promotion of Seth Malley to VP and divisional merchandise manager, beverage. He had been merchandise manager for frozen foods.
On the general merchandise side of the business, Scott McCall, senior VP and GMM for health and wellness merchandising, has been moved to leadership of entertainment, toys and seasonal products, while Deanah Baker, senior VP and GMM for ladies' apparel, intimates, jewelry and accessories, has expanded her portfolio to include all apparel, shoes and accessories.
In addition, Jeff Evans, who had been in charge of men's and children's apparel and shoes, has been named senior VP and GMM of home merchandise, which includes cooking, dining, bed and bath, home decor, fabrics, and crafts.
According to a memo from Scott Pleiman, executive vice president of merchandising operations, the division will now be led by centralized teams that work with the buying organization “to drive value and provide better insights into customer expectations.”
A number of personnel shifts have occurred in the merchandising ops team as well. Greg Hall, who had been senior VP and GMM of entertainment, will take on the role of senior VP of food merchandise operations. Kim Strickland, who had been VP of health and wellness, central operations, has been appointed senior VP of merchandise operations for consumables and health and wellness. Finally, Kevin Pate has been named senior VP of general merchandise operations.
The shifts and promotions were announced the same week that Walmart revealed its latest round of layoffs at its home office — the third to occur this year. The layoffs, said to number “a few dozen,” are being made in Walmart's merchandising (which includes buyers and planners) and replenishment divisions, for the most part.
While Walmart hones its operations, it has also maintained its focus on promoting U.S. manufacturing and creating more jobs in this country. Late last month the company revealed a program, “Walmart's Policy Roadmap to Renew U.S. Manufacturing,” intended to spur job growth by boosting domestic manufacturing. The main proposals contained in the plan include:
• Building vocational training programs linked to local ­industry.
• Encouraging component production to help close supply chain gaps.
• Facilitating public-private cooperation to promote manufacturing clusters.

By JENNIFER PELTZ
Associated Press
NEW YORK (AP) - Harvey Weinstein was indicted on rape and criminal sex act charges, furthering the first criminal case to arise from a slate of sexual misconduct allegations against the former movie mogul.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said Wednesday's indictment brings Weinstein "another step closer to accountability" for alleged attacks on two women in New York.
Weinstein's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said he would "vigorously defend" against the indictment and ask a court to dismiss it. He called the allegations "unsupported" and reiterated that Weinstein strongly denies them.
The indictment came hours after Weinstein's lawyer said the film producer would decline to testify before the grand jury because there wasn't enough time to prepare him and "political pressure" made an indictment unavoidable.
"Regardless of how compelling Mr. Weinstein's personal testimony might be, an indictment was inevitable due to the unfair political pressure being placed on Cy Vance to secure a conviction of Mr. Weinstein," the statement said.
Weinstein, 66, learned of the specific charges and the accusers' identities only after turning himself on Friday, according to his lawyers. Brafman said that with a deadline set for Wednesday afternoon for Weinstein to testify or not, prosecutors denied his request for more time.
Vance said the Weinstein camp's "recent assault on the integrity of the survivors and the legal process is predictable."
"We are confident that when the jury hears the evidence, it will reject these attacks out of hand," Vance said in a statement.
Weinstein was charged Friday with raping one woman and committing a criminal sex act by compelling oral sex from another. A grand jury continued hearing evidence in the case, as it had been doing for weeks.
Defendants have the right to testify in a grand jury's secret proceedings but often don't, for various reasons.
Freed on $1 million bail and electronic monitoring, he is due back in court July 30, though that date may now be moved up in light of the indictment.
Beyond the two women involved in the case, dozens more women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to assault in various locales.
He has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex, and Brafman said Tuesday that Weinstein was "confident he's going to clear his name" in the New York prosecution.
Brafman called the rape allegation "absurd," saying that the accuser and Weinstein had a decade-long, consensual sexual relationship that began before and continued after the alleged 2013 attack.
The woman, who hasn't been identified publicly, told investigators that Weinstein confined her in a hotel room and raped her.
The other accuser in the case, former actress Lucia Evans, has gone public with her account of Weinstein forcing her to perform oral sex at his office in 2004. The Associated Press does not identify alleged victims of sexual assaults unless they come forward publicly.
Vance, a Democrat, came under public pressure from women's groups to prosecute Weinstein after declining to do so in 2015, when an Italian model went to police to say Weinstein had groped her during a meeting.
Police set up a sting in which the woman recorded herself confronting Weinstein and him apologizing for his conduct. But Vance decided there wasn't enough evidence to bring charges.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo, also a Democrat, ordered the state attorney general to investigate how Vance handled that matter.

You can't really tell from this picture, but it has been a very mild winter so far in Calgary. I'm not sure what the temperature was when I shot this photo, but it was sweater weather for sure. I did kind of a weird edit on this shot, I was going for a grainy film look. I'm not sure if the edit worked out exactly how I was planning, but I kinda like the picture. Anyhow, I think the warm weather is going to be sticking around for a little while longer, so I'll be getting out there as much as I can before it get's cold again!

Nigerian Army of ‘Operation Lafiya Dole' in the north east on Friday night made a heavy breakthrough when it arrested a Caretaker Chairman of Mafa Local Government Area of Borno state, Alhaji Shettima Lawan Maina for hiding a top Boko Haram Commander (name withheld) in his house at 1000 housing estate along Maiduguri- Damaturu- Kano road.
Vanguard reports that the incident, according to sources living at the same estate with the Chairman did not come to them as a surprise following the capture of Sambisa Forest, a stronghold of insurgents by troops that led to so many of the terrorists escaping to various places for safety.
A resident and neighbours of the LG boss said, the military and some security operatives stormed the house after getting an intelligence report that the top Boko Haram commander had sneaked into the
house for safety.
Already the source said, both the top Boko Haram Commander and the Chairman have been detained in a military facility to enable thorough investigation as to how a wanted terrorist will sneak into the house of the Chairman, knowing fully well, that politicians of such caliber do not usually allow access to their house of abode.
When contacted for confirmation, the Police Public Relations Officer, Victor Isuku's phone lines were not reachable, but a top security officer who is not authorized to talk to the press confirmed the incident, stating that
Research Indicates 20% of Financial Institutions Plan to Trade Crypto
According to a survey by Thomson Reuters, one in five financial institutions are thinking about trading digital currencies at some point over the next year. Despite the lull in prices so far in 2018, it appears that many are seeing opportunity thanks to the volatility associated with the space.
Is This the Beginning of Institutions Taking Public Positions in Crypto?
The survey published today was put to over 400 of Thomson Reuters Corp's clients. These included asset managers, hedge funds, and trading desks associated with the world's largest banks. Twenty percent of those asked indicated that they had thought about buying and selling digital assets at some point in the next twelve months.
The co-head of trading at Thomson Reuters, Neil Penney, spoke to Business Insider earlier today about the pending rise in institutional investment in digital assets:
“Cryptocurrency is still a relatively small part of the trading market, but this survey makes clear this niche segment is starting to enter the mainstream of the financial services industry. This is a major change from a year ago.”
Unfortunately, today's survey was the first of its kind by Thomson Reuters. As such, there are no such figures to help determine the change in institutional interest in digital currencies over the last twelve months.
Many crypto analysts had wrongly assumed that the launch of the CME and CBOE Bitcoin futures markets last December would signal an influx of money from traditional investment sectors. However, these particular financial products have not proved nearly as popular as some had hoped.
This hasn't dampened enthusiasm for cryptocurrency trading too much, however. Of the 20% of survey respondents who affirmed that they were considering trading digital currencies in the next twelve months, over two thirds of them said they were planning on entering the market in the next three to six months.
Financial regulators have begun to clean up the space of fraudulent companies and blatant scams and it is this maturing market, along with the dramatic volatility and potentially limitless upside potential of certain crypto projects, that is currently attracting such institutional interest to trading digital currencies.
Already this week, we've reported about Goldman Sachs' new appointment of Justin Schmidt to their cryptocurrency markets unit. This highlights a very real commitment to helping their clients get the exposure to digital assets that they're obviously seeking. It appears from the Thomson Reuters survey this week that many more will follow Goldman's lead in the coming months.

Nigeria targets 50m database growth by December
Nigeria has targeted to grow its database to 50 million by December this year and 70 million by 2019.
This is as the process of harmonization of identity schemes in Nigeria, the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has seen the database grow from 7 million to 14 million by 2016 and from 14 million to 28million in 2017.
The Federal Government believed that a robust identity management system with quality data is key for every emerging economy as such, Nigeria and by extension Africa must leverage on its digital identity as a reliable tool for socio economic development.
President Muhammadu Buhari gave these indications Tuesday while declaring open the fourth annual government forum on electronic identity in Africa organised by the National Identity Commission, NIMC in collaboration with ID4Africa on the theme: ‘Harmonization of Identity Scheme' holding at the International Conference Centre, Abuja.
Buhari who was represented by Secretary to Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha noted that, the Federal Government has long recognized the need to have a single national identity system for all citizens in order to carry out its mandate in social and economic development, law enforcement, intelligence and political development.
He emphasized that the international community, especially the developed countries have adopted identity as a tool for transformation of governance and service delivery in areas such as transportation, financial inclusion, immigration, healthcare, social safety nets, agriculture, security and so on and Nigeria as well as Africa cannot be left behind.
“Africa needs to embrace the global drive towards optimization in the use of resources by making its Digital Identity Infrastructure efficient thereby creating an enabling environment for talented African youths to tap into these technologies.
“Indeed, with the advent of disruptive technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Block-chain, now is the time to build an ecosystem that will enhance continent-wide security, minimize fraud and wasteful expenditure”, the President maintained.
In his introductory remarks, Joseph Atick, Executive Chairman, ID4Africa who explained that the body is a multi- stakeholder movement that promotes the transparent and responsible adoption of digital identity in the service of development in Africa, announced that Nigeria is on its way to harmonize its identity practices.
Atick explained that the three day conference would explore the applications of identity not only for socioeconomic development, but also for humanitarian action, security and facilitation through a rich and diverse programme and thanked the government of Nigeria, the World bank and other stakeholders who make this year's event a success.
Also speaking, Nigeria's Minister of Interior, Abdulharaman Danbazzau stressed importance of digital identity in Nigeria as he said, “identity is everything, identity is security, without identity it is impossible to know who belongs where”
Danbazzau stated that the conference was of high significance, not only for the intention to harmonise identity in the whole Africa but the need to digitalize the identity and promised the support of his ministry to identity management in Nigeria.
On his part, the Comptroller General, Nigerian Immigration Service, Muhammad Babandede said immigration is a key government agency responsible for identity management and the major identity it hold is that of Nigerian passport which account for 10 million identities in its data base which is unique, hence it cut across all the elites.
“Based on the directives of Mr. President, we have linked with NIMC that is why this year you have to fill your National Identification Number as you get your passport. We also provide offices for NIMC anywhere we are operating and we invite NIMC to join us in our foreign missions. We are working to harmonise all identities at the airport with NIMC”, he stated.
Earlier in a welcome address, Chairman of the Governing Board, NIMC, Olagunsoye Oyinlola observed that despite challenges, there is a renewed determination to leverage on the enormous opportunities such as public/private partnership synergy to turn the identity management sector in Nigeria, while Aliyu Aziz, NIMC Director General, thanked ID4Africa, the Federal Government, local and international partners for their support.

SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) — Customs officers in Macedonia say they have seized more than 300 kilograms of cannabis in a truck, hidden in pallets loaded with sacks of rice, at a border crossing with Greece.
The customs office said Tuesday that the drugs, bound for Western Europe, had an estimated street value of 800,000 euros ($990,000). The 36-year-old Greek truck driver, whose name wasn't provided, was arrested on trafficking charges.
The office said the vehicle had started out in Athens and that details of the case had been forwarded to a prosecutor's office.
Macedonia is a major transit point for international drug traffickers, including the transport of heroin from southwest Asia to Europe, and has recently seen a spike in cannabis trafficking, according to reports from European Union monitoring agencies.

In 2008, MCPS installed their first turf field at Richard Montgomery High School. Their contractor told them they were getting “breakthrough” technology and touted “unmatched durability” against wear—the “safest system you can buy,” as described in company sales pitches.
Now, 10 years later, FieldTurf—the company that installed all six Montgomery County high school turf fields—is the target of a federal class-action suit brought by organizations in 46 states and the District of Columbia, alleging the company knowingly sold “inherently and materially defective” fields.
A major player in the international turf industry, FieldTurf has been forced to replace one MCPS high school's field three years ahead of schedule “to assure the safety of athletes,” because the carpet on the field was “deteriorated” and “heavily worn,” according to a January 2017 Montgomery Parks department press release.
FieldTurf, for its part, stands by the safety of its fields.
“Every single field in Montgomery County is proven the safest possible field in existence,” FieldTurf regional sales representative John McShane said in a phone interview Feb. 28.
Over the past decade, MCPS has replaced some of its grass fields with artificial turf because it offers increased field-time and durability, MCPS athletic director Jeffrey Sullivan said.
Whitman, along with Einstein High School and Julius West Middle School, is in line to get a turf field this summer. The Montgomery County Council approved $4.9 million to fund construction of the fields; Montgomery Soccer Inc. agreed to cover $4.2 million of the cost in exchange for 1,000 hours of field time per year over a 10-year period. The Whitman All-Sports Booster Club will contribute an additional $300,000 to the school's project.
FieldTurf is among the bidders in the district's open bid process, McShane confirmed.
Meanwhile, tests at two of the current turf fields have revealed spots that at times have been worn to the point of being deemed unsafe for athletic competition, per MCPS and industry standards. Continued use of the fields has raised concerns over the validity of MCPS's testing protocol and whether MCPS is doing enough to ensure the safety of athletes.
Faulty technology…
In 2005, FieldTurf started selling fields made of Duraspine fiber, which they marketed as a breakthrough product that would last at least 10 years, according to sales pitches cited in the class-action suit. FieldTurf sold at least 1,450 Duraspine fields all over the country between 2005–12, the lawsuit states, including the field at Montgomery Blair High School. Two other MCPS fields—at Richard Montgomery and Walter Johnson High Schools—are made of FieldTurf Duraspine fiber as well.
FieldTurf stopped selling the Duraspine fields in 2012 after complaints over the durability of the fields, according to the lawsuit.
The class-action lawsuit against FieldTurf came in the wake of national criticism following a 2016 investigative series titled “The 100-Yard Deception,” written by NJ Advance Media, a content provider for newspapers across New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The piece alleged that FieldTurf knew about the defects with the Duraspine fiber but continued to sell the fields anyway.
FieldTurf denied the allegations in the NJ Advance Media story, saying that concerns with Duraspine never compromised field safety and only affected some fields.
“There is not and has never been any issue with the safety of these fields for playing on,” FieldTurf CEO Eric Daliere wrote in an open letter late 2016.
In 2011, the company sued their supplier for defects in the manufacture of the Duraspine fiber. Daliere said in the open letter that the defects only affected “how a field looks over time in certain UV environments,” particularly in the Southern and Southwestern regions. However, many organizations that have joined the national suit against FieldTurf—including Montgomery Parks—are not located in high UV environments.
From the sale of these Duraspine fields, FieldTurf made an estimated revenue of $570 million, mostly at the expense of taxpayers, NJ Advance Media reported.
Blair was forced to replace their Duraspine field, owned and overseen by Montgomery Parks, three years earlier than expected after it failed a safety test midway through the fall sports season in October 2016. The field was still under warranty, Parks director Michael Riley wrote in a letter April 5, 2017, though it wasn't clear at the time how much—if any—the company would pay for the “approximately $725,000” replacement. A Jan. 27, 2018, NBC4 report cites an unnamed “official” as saying the replacement was billed to taxpayers, but The Black & White was unable to verify this report. Montgomery Parks joined the class-action lawsuit against FieldTurf in January 2018.
MCPS, which owns all other turf fields and will own Whitman's, is currently monitoring the conditions of its fields and will join the lawsuit if it becomes necessary, MCPS spokesman Derek Turner said in a phone interview Feb. 28.
…Leads to unsafe fields
Athletes say the fields at Richard Montgomery and Walter Johnson have more visible patches of exposed crumb rubber pellets than other turf fields. The suit against FieldTurf alleges that Duraspine fibers shed from the field during normal use, meaning they hold infill less effectively, as can be seen by these exposed patches. Infill is more easily moved around and off the field, compromising the safety of the turf.
Tests at the Richard Montgomery and Walter Johnson fields have revealed both to be potentially dangerous to MCPS athletes per industry standards. Still, MCPS continues to allow athletic competition on the fields, leading some experts to question their testing procedure and standards for turf safety.
One important measure of turf field safety is the GMAX level test, which measures shock absorption and intensity of impact when an athlete falls on the field. The higher the GMAX level is, the less shock the surface absorbs and the more dangerous the field is for athletes—specifically in terms of knee and head injuries.
Turf infill is intended to soften the playing surface, cushioning the concrete base underneath. When the field is used, the pellets are displaced from high traffic areas and the GMAX levels there increase as the layer of shock absorption between player and concrete is thinned.
GMAX levels above 200 can be life threatening if a player hits their head on the field, according to Penn State's Center for Sports Surface Research.
The Synthetic Turf Council, an industry trade association, recommends a standard maximum of 165, which is also used by the NFL and Fairfax County. For reference, the average natural grass field has an equivalent GMAX rating of 90, Maryland SoccerPlex states on its website. Yet the MCPS standard for GMAX is anything below 200.
“When you see something that looks like grass, you think you can play on it,” said Gastón de los Reyes Jr., an assistant professor of strategic management and public policy at George Washington University. “But if the GMAX levels are above 200, then it might be closer to playing on concrete, and that's when you get the risk of head and knee injuries.”
In October 2016, Athletic Field Consultants, Inc., a company subcontracted by FieldTurf, tested Blair's field during a mandated biannual test. GMAX levels on the field measured over 200 in multiple areas, a report published by the Montgomery County Parents Coalition revealed. Initial repairs were made before play resumed, and the field was replaced in 2017. However, it's likely that students played on the field while the levels were still unsafe: the Blair Blazers had played a home football game just three days before the test.
“ When you see something that looks like grass, you think you can play on it. But if the GMAX levels are above 200, then it might be closer to playing on concrete.” — Gaston de los Reyes Jr.
“Current guidelines for GMAX have a limit of 200, but we are well, well below that limit. That's a threshold limit and all our fields are well below that,” county athletic director Sullivan said in a phone interview. “We follow MCPS standards and make sure our levels are well in compliance with those testing standards.”
MCPS doesn't own the Blair field, but its fields suffer similar issues. Tests in the summer of 2016 on the fields at Richard Montgomery and Walter Johnson revealed that both had average GMAX ratings around 180 with multiple spots at Richard Montgomery registering well over 200, according to reports by the companies FieldTurf contracted to test the fields. One spot at RM registered over 250—significantly higher than the threshold for life-threatening. This information was first published in an Aug. 16, 2016, Forbes article and a Nov. 2, 2016, Bethesda Magazine article.
Instead of immediately replacing the fields like Montgomery Parks did at Blair, MCPS waited to have the fields retested. The turf tester noted in his report that maintenance crews added rubber infill to high-use areas and groomed the fields immediately prior to tests. Resulting average GMAX levels dropped close to 30 points at each site.
Though he has not been involved in MCPS fields, de los Reyes expressed concern about this testing method.
“We also want to know what the field was testing at before you went to do your test,” de los Reyes said. “That would show what children are actually exposed to so they should know what the test number revealed before they added the infill.”
A FAQ on turf fields posted on the MPCS website states, “areas reading close to 200 in GMAX will be monitored and rejuvenated as needed by de-compacting infill and adding infill mix to increase depth.”
While this process can lower GMAX levels temporarily, if a field has GMAX levels in the 250s in some areas, like Richard Montgomery had in 2016, simply adding infill can't bring down those levels for any length of time, said Buzz Splittgerber, owner of Idaho-based turf testing company BuzzTurf. Especially on a high-use high school field, the infill is going to get moved around very quickly, creating an inconsistent surface, he said.
“I've never seen a case like that, and I've tested a lot of fields. When it gets to be that high [then] the turf is worn out, so the infill material itself just doesn't stay in,” Splittgerber said in a phone interview.
Splittgerber has not tested any Montgomery County fields.
Ryan Teeter, who administered the June 2016 test of the Richard Montgomery field, corroborated this view in an interview that year with Bethesda Magazine. Teeter said in the interview that the grass fibers are responsible for holding the crumb rubber infill in place, and if the fibers fail, which Teeter said they had, the field can quickly deteriorate.
In any case, both Duraspine MCPS fields are dangerously close to—if not over—even the weakest of standards.
“Any ratings close to 200 should be cause for concern and should not be considered to be safe,” Splittgerber said in an email. “In my opinion, accepting average readings of 199 is not safety first.”
For MCPS athletes, what happens next?
MCPS will install a turf field at Whitman in the near future. Installation is planned to start immediately after the spring sports season, county athletic director Sullivan said. FieldTurf has submitted a bid for the field, sales representative McShane confirmed. FieldTurf no longer uses Duraspine technology.
Asked if FieldTurf remains a serious contender for the new contract, MCPS spokesman Turner replied: “MCPS has a formal bid process for fields where any qualifying vendors can submit their bids. No announcement has been made about who will receive the contract at this time.” MCPS has offered no public indication of concern over FieldTurf itself and has not yet followed Montgomery Parks in joining the class-action lawsuit against the company.
“FieldTurf has installed a lot of successful fields across the country,” Sullivan said.
The MCPS Board of Education has twice delayed awarding a contract for the three fields. In anticipation of the new turf field, Whitman's Bermuda grass field never underwent its regular winter maintenance. Since the turf won't be installed until summer, Whitman's spring athletes will now be forced to play home games on the grass anyway. Sullivan said the field will be ready for play in time for the spring season.
This summer, the Richard Montgomery field will have completed its 10th year of use, but Richard Montgomery athletic director Chamara Wijeratne said he wasn't aware of any definite plan to replace it. The Walter Johnson field will have completed its eighth year. At present, MCPS has not allocated funds to replace either the Walter Johnson or the Richard Montgomery field.
MCPS athletes will spend hundreds of hours playing on the two fields this spring. Given ongoing lawsuits, defective technology and weak testing standards, their safety is questionable at best.

KNUST has admitted the youngest student ever into the university.
The Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology has admitted the youngest student ever into the university.
A 13-year-old girl called Ruth Ama Gyan-Darkwah has become the subject of discussion among many Ghanaians, after she was admitted into the KNUST.
The Chronicle reported that young Ruth is pursuing a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Mathematics at the University
She is related to Dr Afari Gyan
Reports suggest that Ruth Ama Gyan-Darkwah is related to former chairman of the Electoral Commission (EC), Dr. Kwadwo Afari Gyan.
It is not very clear what Afari Gyan's actual stand in the family line of the 13-year-old is, however, both are from the same family lineage. That should probably explain where her brilliance comes from. Maybe it runs in the family.
Her father is a physics teacher
Mr. Kwadwo Gyan-Darkwah is the father of Ruth, and he actually teaches physics at Prempeh College Senior High School. And if you care to know, Ruth lived with her father at the teachers' bungalow of Prempeh College before gaining admission to KNUST.
She entered SHS at age 10
Most 10-year-olds in Ghana should normally be thinking about getting into junior high school, but the story of young Ruth is quite different. She actually entered the St. Louis Senior High School aged just 10. She offered a course in General Science and successfully graduated in 2012
Her Elder sister will graduate from KNUST aged 18
It seems not only Ruth has entered the university at a very young age. Her elder sister, Grace Gyan appears to also have entered the university at a tender age, albeit still not beating that of Ruth.
Grace, who offers Political Science at the KNUST, will complete her tertiary education next year at age 18.
A court has ordered that a dog be put down after it attacked a child and injured a man in a second incident.
The order was passed on Lion, an eight-year-old Dogue de Bordeaux by Blackpool magistrates.
Deborah Barnes-Dunne, a 57-year-old professional dog walker, of Ullswater Avenue, Fleetwood, pleaded guilty to having a dog which was dangerously out of control at a Freeport Shopping Village car park.
She was sentenced to six months in prison suspended for two years, put on a two months curfew from 8pm to 6am and fined £100 with £200 compensation plus £115 victims' surcharge by Blackpool magistrates.
Prosecutor, Malcolm Isherwood, said the victim and two friends were walking back to their car on the overflow car park at Freeport on November 26 about 4pm.
He said a large scary angry looking dog ran up and grabbed his arm with its teeth. He ended up on the ground with the dog on top of him.
He said if he had not been wearing a long-sleeved jacket he said he would have been severely injured.
Barnes-Dunne then dragged the dog into her car. The victim, who said there were adults and children about at the time, suffered a cut to his thumb and grazing to his legs.
He said Barnes-Dunne apologised and asked him not to report the matter to the police. She went to a cash machine and gave him £250 for the damage to his clothes.
A witness said the dog had no muzzle on and was not on a lead.
At the time of the offence Barnes-Dunne was on a suspended prison sentence made in November last year for an offence of having the same dog dangerously out of control when it injured a child.
The court on that occasion ordered that if the dog did not wear a muzzle and be on a lead at all times in a public place, it should be destroyed.
Gerry Coyle, defending, said in June this year his client's home had burnt down and she was living with a friend.
She had been diagnosed with mental health issues and was on medication.
Mr Coyle added: “The dog is like the dog in the film Turner and Hooch – a big slobbering type. It is eight and has hardly any teeth. The breed suffers from heart back and leg problems.”
“The day of the offence the dog had been sick in the car, so the defendant went to a quiet parking place to give him a drink of water.
“The dog was full of exuberance and jumped up at the man, knocking him over. She had apologised and was full of remorse.
“Later that evening the police came, took the dog and put him in kennels.
“Since then she has been heartbroken.”
If you do your homework, now is the time to practically steal a new sedan from your car dealer.
For more than a year, sales of cars have been tanking because Americans have gone nuts over SUVs and trucks. As stockpiles of sedans such as the Chevrolet Malibu and Chrysler 200 stretch across car lots, automakers are forced to offer big discounts to move them.
There are a few steps to finding the best bargain, but it boils down to this: Figure out which cars aren't selling, research discounts and don't buy until the end of the month when dealers are more desperate to sell.
Brad Korner, general manager of AIS Rebate, an Ann Arbor, Michigan, firm that follows the labyrinth of automaker discounts, equates buying a car cheap with purchasing discounted baked goods. To get the good deal, you have to really look. "You go into the store and the day-old bakery stuff is on a different shelf," he says.
Be wary of offers that seem too good to be true, like $69 per month payments. Earl Stewart, a North Palm Beach, Florida, Toyota dealer who is critical of other dealers' sales tactics, advises people to ignore dealer advertising. "Probably 99 percent of it is misleading," he says. The low-price deals often are on stripped-down models that the dealer may not even have. They also can include hefty down payments.
But armed with the right information, you can navigate the new car sales maze and get 20 percent or more off a car's sticker price:
FIRST: PICK A TARGET, FIND SLOW SELLERS
For more than a year, many compact, midsize and large cars, gas-electric hybrids, and many lower-level luxury cars haven't sold well. So dealers have big supplies. Because they're paying interest on the cars, they're eager to sell. So figure out the size of car you want. Then look for automaker monthly sales press releases on the internet and find models with big year-over-year declines. The sales figures are released early in the month. To get the best deal, you can't be too picky about color or equipment because you need to buy what's on dealer lots.
SECOND: LOOK FOR DISCOUNTS ONLINE
Many websites, including those from the auto companies as well as kbb.com, truecar.com and Edmunds.com, list publicly available discounts called incentives. Say you decide on a midsize car. Sales of the Nissan Altima were off nearly 15 percent in January, so incentives are likely. On its website, Nissan was offering $4,550 off a nicely equipped $25,460 Altima Midnight edition. That's nearly 18 percent off the sticker without haggling! There often are combinations of zero percent financing and cash back. according to Wards Automotive, midsize cars with the biggest inventories include the Chevrolet Malibu, Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Hyundai Sonata and Ford Fusion — some of the top-selling cars in the U.S.
THIRD: VISIT DEALERS
During the first two weeks of the month, go to a few dealers. Confirm the incentives you found online — then ask for more. Often automakers add deals by region, or they offer rebates if you own a competitor's model or have one of their models. There also are other discounts for being an AAA member, serving in the military or being a recent college graduate. Most sales people, when they find out you've done your homework, will be honest and give you a good price, says Korner. Michelle Krebs, an analyst for Autotrader.com, says at this point, don't mention a trade-in. Work that into the deal later. Don't agree to buy at this time.
FOURTH: PICK A DEALER, GO BACK LATER
You'll get an even better price by waiting until the last few days of a month or quarter. First, dealers offer sales people bonuses to meet monthly sales goals. If they are close to the bonus, they'll be more willing to deal. Also, dealers get what are called "stair step" incentives from automakers for hitting sales goals. It's big money, so dealers close to their targets are more willing to bargain.
For a larger dealer, Stewart says hitting stair step goals can mean $250,000 or more, the difference between a monthly profit and loss. General Motors is helping some dealers get rid of 2016 cars by giving up to 20 percent off the sticker.
Bigger dealers can get higher payments from automakers and sometimes can offer better prices than smaller ones.
The bottom line is if you go through all these steps and you're a tough negotiator, you can get a well-equipped car for less than the price of a stripped-down SUV.
Even if you don't move this month, deals on cars probably will go on for a while. "Until the buying public loses its appetite for SUVs, it's not going to change," says Jeff Rogers, general manager of the Williamson Automotive Group in Miami.

MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Jose Mourinho expressed his concern about the potential schedule logjam facing Manchester United in the final months of the season, saying Wednesday it poses the team "many, many, many problems."
United is still involved in four competitions — the Premier League, the FA Cup, the Europa League and the League Cup.
"If we progress in the competitions," Mourinho said, "we will be in trouble."
United is through to the last 32 of the Europa League — it plays French club Saint-Etienne in the first leg on Thursday — and has also reached the last 16 of the FA Cup. There are 13 rounds left in the Premier League, in which United is in sixth place and fighting for Champions League qualification through a top-four finish. And United has got through to the final of the English League Cup against Southampton on Feb. 26.
With 13 weeks left in the season, United could have 27 games to play. Multiple games per week would be commonplace, especially since United is in good form with only one loss in 22 games in all competitions.
"We cannot choose competitions at Man United," Mourinho said.
For that reason, Mourinho is set to play a strong team against Saint-Etienne at Old Trafford, in a competition that offers the winner an automatic place in next season's Champions League.
"The Europa League is a not a competition we want to play," Mourinho said, "but we play."
Mourinho said Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick and Phil Jones will miss the game because of injury. Paul Pogba is set to play, which will mean the France midfielder taking on his older brother, Florentin, for the first time in a competitive game.
"It's a good, nice destiny," Mourinho said. "I think only mum Pogba is in trouble. It's impossible for the lady to choose. I know, from Paul, that the mum wants a draw."
BOSS BRIAN McDermott praised the toughness of players who battled through the pain barrier in Leeds Rhinos' 42-22 win over Widnes Vikings yesterday.
BOSS BRIAN McDermott praised the toughness of players who battled through the pain barrier in Leeds Rhinos' 42-22 win over Widnes Vikings yesterday.
Ashton Golding and Liam Sutcliffe missed out after being hurt in the win at Hull on Good Friday and Ash Handley was called into the side despite struggling with a knee problem.
McDermott revealed Stevie Ward, who returned from a hamstring injury against Hull and Brett Delaney were also carrying knocks.
Anthony Mullally has joined Rhinos' casualty list after suffering suspected fractured ribs in the first half yesterday.
“Stevie was a doubt for the Hull game,” McDermott revealed. “We are down some troops at the moment through suspensions and injuries.
“He probably should not have played at Hull, so for him to back up and play at centre is a really big effort from him.
“Brett Delaney has been carrying a hamstring for a number of weeks and Ash Handley took himself out of a [knee] brace after being told he'd be four to six weeks.
“I think he's been about nine days in the brace and took himself out to play. There's another fella (believed to be Tom Briscoe, who suffered a dead leg at Hull) who probably should not have played.
“There was some real toughness. The medics would advise them all to spend longer on the sidelines before coming back, but we are not afforded that luxury.”
Rhinos led 30-6 at half-time, but saw Widnes cut the gap to just eight points before two late
tries sealed the win.
McDermott said: “There were a couple of things involved in the second half, not the least Widnes' desire to get back into the game.
“I think we were running at something like a 40 per cent completion rate in the second half and I don't care who you are, how good a coach you are or what type of team you've got, nobody can keep challenging against any team like that.
“They are a determined team. The last thing we wanted to do was give them an invite into the game and that's exactly what we did.
“Credit to Widnes, they made it a contest when, if we had gone about things differently, it never would have been.”
Of the effect of two games in such a short period, McDermott said: “Everyone's in the same boat.
“I can't be too critical. I am not too down on the players about it.
“We found ourselves in a situation where we were fighting for the game and we should never have been.
“We can get angry about that if you like, but you have to deal with the situation itself and I thought the players showed some maturity and some toughness.
“I won't get too wrapped up in the second half. It made it interesting and entertaining and got everybody all anxious, but the real focus point for us will be the first half.
“We were really clinical and looked great, full of energy.”

Sex-for-marks: What Monica Osagie told OAU's investigative panel today
The alleged victim in the sex-for-marks scandal, Miss Monica Osagie affirmed before an investigated panel that Prof. Richard Akindele deliberately failed her because she refused his sexual demand.
Osagie, a postgraduate student in the Masters of Business programme, had released a recorded telephone conversation, which went viral, in which the lecturer identified as Akindele, allegedly demanded sex for marks.
The committee, which held its session at the Pro -Chancellor's Lodge on the campus, allowed only Osagie and her counsel into the venue.
Journalists, students and some members of the National Human Right Commission who came to witness the sitting were not allowed into the venue by security personnel of the institution who manned the entrance.
Akinyode-Afolabi, who spoke with newsmen after the closed door session which lasted for more than seven hours, said Osagie told the panel that she passed the course but was later failed by the don because of her refusal to sleep with him.
She said that Osagie narrated in details what transpired between her and the don, adding that lawyers present at the meeting were not allowed to make any contribution.
Akinyode-Afolabi , who is the Executive Director for Human Advocate Research and Documentation Centre, Abuja, said that Osagie also informed the panel that she recorded the conversation between her and the professor as evidence.
She said Osagie also informed the panel that she reported the sexual harassment by the don to some lecturers in the university, adding that no action was taken by them.
Akinyode-Afolabi said some lawyers who represented the lecturers who Osagie claimed she reported the case to also appeared before the panel.
She said that Osagie also told the panel that she did not score 33 per cent as alleged but was failed so that she could bow to the sexual demand of the don.
Akinyode-Afolabi said she was optimistic that the outcome of the panel would serve as a lesson to other lecturers who also engage in such acts.
She, however, urged the panel to ensure that justice prevailed on the issue so as to maintain the integrity of the institution.
Akinyode-Afolabi, who did not allow Osagie to talk to newsmen, said her client would always be available to give evidence whenever she was called upon.
Members of the panel did not also speak with newsmen after the meeting.

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — An Ohio officer's fatal shooting of a 16-year-old boy during a scuffle outside a juvenile courtroom has some people questioning whether such sheriff's deputies should carry guns while monitoring that court.
The Columbus Dispatch reports the Jan. 17 shooting of Joseph Haynes prompted an online petition demanding that deputies stop carrying guns in Franklin County Juvenile Court.
An official from the local police union that represents deputies says taking away guns from trained officers would be a mistake.
Sheriff Dallas Baldwin declined to talk about whether court security measures are being reviewed, saying such discussion would be inappropriate until the shooting investigation is finished.
Court security by armed deputies is common practice, though not universal. Connecticut and Massachusetts don't allow their court-employed security officers to carry guns in court.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A failed attempt to sneak into Japan to visit Disneyland in 2001 may have doomed the leadership dreams of the half-brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, who was assassinated this week in an airport in Malaysia. Banished from his dictator father's favor, the exiled Kim Jong Nam frequented casinos, five-star hotels and traveled around Asia, with little say in North Korean affairs. That ended Monday when he was killed in the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Officials in South Korea say they believe the attack was carried out by North Korean agents. Despite multiple reported assassination attempts over the years, Kim Jong Nam was still a member of the most important family in North Korea, a direct blood descendent of North Korea founder Kim Il Sung. Estranged for years from his relatives, the 45-year-old gambler and playboy played a key, if complicated role in the dynasty that has ruled for three generations since North Korea's foundation in 1948. Here's a look: — PARENTS Kim Jong Nam is the eldest son of Kim Jong Il, the second member of the Kim family to rule North Korea. Kim Jong Il had three known sons with two different women. Jong Nam was born from his father's unofficial relationship with North Korean actress Sung Hae Rim. Kim Jong Il forced Sung to divorce her first husband and live with him, but Kim Il Sung – the first leader of North Korea and Kim Jong Il's father – never accepted Sung as his daughter-in-law. Kim Jong Il reportedly kept Kim Jong Nam's 1971 birth a secret from his father for several years. Sung was reportedly forced to leave North Korea and died in Moscow in 2002. Despite his mother's exile, some foreign experts believed that Kim Jong Nam would end up inheriting power because of a traditional Korean value system that favors the eldest son as heir. Unlike his mother, Kim Jong Nam eventually won the affection of his grandfather, who died in 1994, according to South Korean media reports. — BROTHERS AND SISTERS Kim Jong Nam's two younger brothers share a mother: Kim Jong Il's Japan-born mistress, the dancer Ko Yong Hui. Ko's links to Japan, which colonized the Korean Peninsula in the early part of the 20th century, led some to believe that Kim Jong Nam would outpace his siblings in the succession race. Ko immigrated to North Korea in the 1960s from Japan, where she had lived among the ethnic Korean minority. She died in Paris in 2004. Kim Jong-un eventually won the succession race and became the North's supreme leader in late 2011 upon the death of his father. Believed to be in his early 30s, Kim Jong-un has carried out a series of high-profile executions and purges, and outside experts say few can now challenge his rule. Kim Jong Nam's other half-brother, Kim Jong Chol, was once viewed by some outsiders as a potential candidate for leader. But a former sushi chef of Kim Jong Il said the late leader derided the middle son, known as a huge fan of rock guitarist Eric Clapton, as “girlish.” The brothers also had at least two known sisters. One is Kim Yo Jong, who shares a mother with Kim Jong-un and who is currently working as a top propaganda official. Another sister, Kim Sol Song, was born from Kim Jong Il's relationship with another woman, Kim Yong Sok. There has been little information about Kim Sol Song, but unconfirmed rumors in the South say she is being detained. — AUNT AND UNCLE Kim Jong Nam's aunt, Kim Kyong Hui, is Kim Jong Il's younger sister. She was reportedly behind the expulsion of Kim Jong Nam's mother to the then Soviet Union in the 1970s. Kim Kyong Hui and her husband Jang Song Thaek then acted as Kim Jong Nam's caretaker. But Jong Nam gradually lost favor with his father. He reportedly spent too much money at a Pyongyang hotel and made wild shopping excursions to China. When he was detained in Tokyo for trying to enter the country with a fake Dominican passport, he sported a diamond-encrusted Rolex watch and carried wads of cash. Kim Kyong Hui and Jang were believed to have played a major role in grooming Kim Jong-un as the next leader. After Kim Jong-un took power, the two initially enjoyed great power. Jang was seen as the country's No.2 until he was stripped of all posts and executed in a sudden purge for alleged treason in 2013. Kim Kyong Hui, who was reportedly seriously ill, disappeared from the public eye. — Follow Hyung-jin Kim on Twitter at twitter.com/hyungjin1972

UNILAG Wades into LUC Controversy, Recommends Rental, not Capital-based Property Assessment
The Department of Estate Management in the Faculty of Environmental Sciences, University of Lagos has volunteered to assist the Lagos State Government to enthrone sustainable Land Use Charge Administration to resolve the current impasse. This is in line with what the Vice Chancellor of the University, Professor Oluwatoyin Ogundipe described as desirable engagement between Town and Gown. Bennett Oghifo reports
The implementation of the new Land Use Charge of the Lagos State Government has, no doubt, hit a major dilemma. Regardless, the impasse, according to the University of Lagos, could be resolved if the government accepted its rich research-based findings on property tax.
The University made its honourable intentions known at ‘A Round Table/Expert Panel Discussion on Property Tax Reform: Towards Sustainable Land Use Charge Administration in Lagos State,' organised by the Department of Estate Management,
Faculty of Environmental Sciences, University of Lagos, last week.
Setting a tone for discussions, the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe said the expert panel set up by the Department was desirable because it was necessary to have quality engagement between Town and Gown to “make positive impact in the environment where we live.”
The VC, represented by the DVC, Management Services, Prof Emukufia Oghojafor, said it was very pleasing that the Department of Estate Management rose to the challenge posed by the controversial new Land Use Charge Law. He charged them to make the outcome of the roundtable available to the Lagos State government, Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing and to the University of Lagos.
In her presentation, the Head, Department of Estate Management, Prof. Modupe M. Omirin commended the state government for its desire to better the lot of residents, but observed that the reviewed Land Use Charge Law lacked key ingredients and thus counterproductive. The HOD, and other experts, who discussed the new law, also provided an alternative.
Prof. Modupe M. Omiri stated that the purposes of the Land Use Charge Law are quite laudable. But, “We are advocating a careful reconsideration of the key issues underlying the Law in order to ensure sustainable administration which, in addition to Adam Smith's canons of taxation – certainty, equity, convenience and economy; will include acceptability; enforceability; affordability; legality or legitimacy; and transparency.
“A good property tax system and the Land Use charge for that matter must be seen to comply with the principles of good governance which also include inclusiveness, subsidiarity, accountability and efficiency. It is the seeming absence of evidence of some of these characteristics that has engendered so much of the negative reactions seen so far.”
She said there are some fine points in the new LUC Law, but that what is wrong with it is the “adoption of capital values as basis of assessment of all properties. Unlike annual rental values which are receivable by property owners and evidence of which is easier to obtain through market surveys and records of actual collection, Capital values are not realisable until a sale occurs. Their determination is not as clear and the fact that transactions that yield evidence of capital values are very infrequent and are subject to various influences make them suspect as a basis for an annual levy. Without gainsaying, the new tax regime may discourage real estate investments in an already depressed market plagued by a rising housing deficit.
“The 40% general relief on all assessed capital values does not in any way provide any relief for persons not in beneficial occupation of their properties. A recourse to the use of Annual rental value (or in the case of properties not let, the annual equivalent of the capital value) should be the basis because; It is more transparent and easier to achieve; The incidence will be on actual earnings from the property; There will be reduced need to adopt an arbitrary general relief rate; The potential inflationary effect of the LUC rate review will be better understood and dealt with; Assessment will be easier based on abundant actual evidence or comparables; Capital values are subjective and ‘unreal' because they do not actually accrue to landlords until a sale occurs and may never do.”
Landlords, she said would shift the incidence of increased LUC by charging higher rents on residential, commercial and other types of property. “Tenants will in turn shift the incidence to goods sold, services rendered, thereby causing widespread inflation and hardship for all citizens. In an economy that is already seriously constrained this is a dangerous trend.”
Discussing an ‘Amicable Resolution to The Seeming Impasse
on the Lagos State Land Use Charge (Luc), 2018', Dr. G.K. Babawale demonstrated why the rental and not the capital value should be used for property assessment.
He stated that “the rental value is generally considered more appropriate, pragmatic, objective, transparent, logical, equitable, cost-effective with higher potential for compliance and therefore revenue yield buoyancy. It is highly recommended for Lagos State.”
According to Babawale, “The LUC, 2018 valuation/assessment process, through a modified area-based mass valuation using the cost method complicates the tax system making it difficult both to understand and administer; it renders it a subject of conflicting interpretation and thereby opening the tax system to manipulation and abuse. It opens the door to endless disputes; makes collection cost excessively high; encourages tax delinquencies: and breeds corruption. All these have grave consequences on compliance and revenue yields.”
Prof. Abiola Sanni, Department of Commercial & Industrial Law, Faculty of Law, University of Lagos, in his presentation, recommended that “Property tax should be used to strengthen the local government system and make them accountable (of course under the supervision and monitoring of the State through the Commissioner of Finance and Local Government).”
The Professor of Taxation & Fiscal Matters, however, said there is Constitutional infraction in the LUC law. “Section 3 of the Land Use Charge Law will resuscitate the debate on conflict with the provision of section 7 Item 1(j) of the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999. “Vesting the Commissioner with the power to “…undertake assessment” is also in conflict with section 7 Item 1(j) of the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 which provides: “The main functions of a local government council are as follows: assessment of privately houses or tenements for the purpose of levying such rates as any be prescribed by the House of Assembly.” The Phrase “The Commissioner” in sections 5(1) & 6, he said should be substituted with “the Local Government Authority.” He said there is also Conflict between section 9(1) and (2). Section 9(1) makes a leaseholder of less than 10 years liable which implies that a leaseholder of more than 10 years is not liable. Section 9(2) then goes further to make leaseholder of over 10 years liable. The combined reading of section 9 means that leaseholders are generally liable irrespective of year. If this is the intention, reference to 10 years is unnecessary.
M.J Fasona, Department of Geography, University of Lagos, in his presentation, ‘GIS and Remote Sensing for Sustainable Land-Use Charge Revenue Collection in Lagos State' advised that “the LUC assessors need to work with credible GIS-based data for a progressive and inclusive LUC –: that is Geo-enabled governance.”

Back in March, Kanye West split from his longtime manager Izzy Zivkovic and hired Scooter Braun, the man behind Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, Carly Rae Jepsen, and more. It was a kingmaking move of sorts for the rapper, but the partnership will apparently be short lived. According to multiple reports, including Billboard, TMZ, and Page Six, the two are no longer working together, at least as it pertains to West's music career. The reports differ in one significant way, though, with Page Six saying that West fired Braun, and TMZ and Billboard presenting the decision as Braun's. A source told Billboard that the split was based on Kanye's decision to “leave the traditional music business,” and that the rapper wants to take his entire business operation in-house instead of using an outside manager and legal team.
TMZ and Page Six's reports make allusions to the stability of West's mental health. TMZ reports that its “sources say [West] seems a little erratic”; Page Six—citing a site called The Blast, which was started by ex-TMZ staffers—writes that West is “behaving in a similar way as he did before his breakdown in 2016,” when he was hospitalized after the cancellation of his Saint Pablo Tour. Despite speculation and rumors regarding his health, West has never revealed any sort of diagnosis.
The separation from Braun is the latest development in what has been a wild reemergence into the public eye by West, who has been tweeting incessantly for over a week, with the lowlight being his dalliance with America's right wing. He also announced the date of several albums, including his own and a collaboration with Kid Cudi, as well as new records by Nas, Pusha T, and Teyena Taylor. This morning he had a frankly bizarre phone call with Ebro Darden of Hot 97, who yesterday had reported that West had told him he “really love[s]” Donald Trump and had been hospitalized for an opioid addiction.
Barack Obama might not be in the Oval Office anymore, but that doesn't mean that he's not still working to help the public. The former president is continuing his work in politics by helping to mentor the next generation of leaders through his Obama Foundation Fellows program.
The two-year program is geared towards “civic innovators from around the world” who are working to help their communities through fresh and creative methods. While the application opened on September 6th, Obama took to his Instagram on Thursday to remind his followers that the final day for applications is today — October 6.
“When I left office, I told you all that the single most important thing I could do would be to help prepare the next generation of leaders to take their own crack at changing the world,” he wrote in his Insta caption.
The application is available on the Obama Foundation's website.
Why Zuma's Love Life Is Great News For Cyril Ramaphosa
On Friday news broke that dear old Jacob was going to be a father again, this time with 24-year-old Nonkanyiso Conco.
We compiled everything we know about Conco in this story, but what about how Cyril will be taking the news?
Sightings of the president patrolling the Sea Point promenade have been few and far between, but I guess that's because he has had his hands full.
One issue that he has had to deal with is Zuma's new habit of taking pot shots at the ANC, the same party that the New York Times took to task, which has led many to wonder if he is trying to create a breakaway faction.
Well, with Zuma set to become a baby daddy for the 22nd 23rd 24th time (nobody seems sure), Huff Post believes Cyril should be grinning ear to ear.
Check it:
This is the best possible news for President Cyril Ramaphosa who reportedly faced the threat of a scalded Zuma mobilising behind disaffected ANC members in KwaZulu-Natal. But now it seems that Zuma has chosen to use his retirement to reignite a plan to marry more regularly… In his first years in office, he married Thobeka Madiba and Gloria Ngema [below] until the ANC put a stop to it. At his wedding to Ngema, Zuma told his new bride, “Don't close the door that you found open…” and he is clearly now free to exercise his options.
A member of the ANC's former leadership told me that the women in the party had approached Zuma and told him that his polygamous lifestyle was accepted as a traditional right, but if the first family expanded annually it would impact on the party's identity as a modern organisation that supported gender rights. So, the president stopped the wedded bliss and reportedly left a Swazi princess, Sebentile Dlamini, stranded after he proposed to her family in 2002. But, unshackled from the chains of office, the former president is now free to be the lover he always was. …to hear that Zuma's lover has won out over his fighter is the best possible news for Ramaphosa.
Finally unshackled, it appears those oats are set to be sown.
Maybe his new conquests will slow his political aims down, although it's obvious that being ousted by his own party has cut him deep.
Let's just hope he eventually ends up behind bars, sans conjugal visits from outsiders.

LAS VEGAS (AP) — A month after speaking at the March for Our Lives in his hometown of Austin, Texas, Matthew McConaughey says he supports some gun control but fears the youth-led movement could be "hijacked" by those hoping to eliminate all guns in the United States.
McConaughey spoke about his support for the marchers in Las Vegas on Monday, where he was promoting his upcoming film, "White Boy Rick," at the CinemaCon theater-owners convention.
He called gun violence "an epidemic in our country." But he says there are responsible gun owners and some want to ban all guns, and he worries the March for Our Lives will be overtaken by that faction.
He says he hopes there's room for agreement between anti-gun activists and the National Rifle Association.
Tim Farron is quitting as leader of the Liberal Democrats saying he cannot carry on the face of continuing questions over his Christian faith.
He said he had been torn between his religion and serving as a political leader.
“The consequences of the focus on my faith is that I have found myself torn between living as a faithful Christian and serving as a political leader,” he said.
“A better, wiser person than me may have been able to deal with this more successfully, to have remained faithful to Christ while leading a political party in the current environment.
“To be a political leader - especially of a progressive, liberal party in 2017 - and to live as a committed Christian, to hold faithfully to the Bible's teaching, has felt impossible for me.”
The shock came just hours after the party's openly gay home affairs spokesman Lord Paddick announced he was quitting citing “concerns about the leader's views on various issues”.
Mr Farron faced criticism during the General Election campaign for failing to answer questions about his position on homosexuality.
He made clear he supported equal marriage and LGBT rights, but in a broadcast interview did not say whether or not it was a sin.
After days of pressure to clarify his stance on the issue, he finally made clear he did not believe gay sex is a sin but continued to face questions in interviews.
In his statement, Mr Farron said the continued questions over his faith showed “we are kidding ourselves” if people in Britain thought they were living in a tolerant liberal society.
“I'm a liberal to my finger tips, and that liberalism means that I am passionate about defending the rights and liberties of people who believe different things to me,” he said.
“There are Christians in politics who take the view that they should impose the tenets of faith on society, but I have not taken that approach because I disagree with it - it's not liberal and it is counterproductive when it comes to advancing the gospel.
“Even so, I seem to be the subject of suspicion because of what I believe and who my faith is in.
“In which case we are kidding ourselves if we think we yet live in a tolerant, liberal society. That's why I have chosen to step down as leader of the Liberal Democrats.”
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has ordered that rapper Meek Mill be immediately released from prison on bail.
The Philadelphia-born rapper, whose real name is Robert Rihmeek Williams, has been fighting for his release while appealing a two- to four-year sentence for a probation violation.
His controversial incarceration has drawn response from the sports community. New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft visited Mill at a state prison in Pennsylvania earlier this month and later called for criminal justice reform.
"It's really bad. I know some of our players in the NFL have talked about this. I see it firsthand. It's just wrong," Kraft said then. "We have to find a way to correct it and also help the community help themselves. It's just sad. This guy is a great guy. Shouldn't be here. And then think of all the taxpayers here paying for people like this to be in jail and not out being productive."
Philadelphia 76ers co-owner Michael Rubin has been one of Mill's biggest supporters. He tweeted Tuesday that he was on his way to pick up the rapper from prison. The Sixers host the Miami Heat on Tuesday night in Game 5 of their first-round playoff series.
Said Mill on Twitter:
"I'd like to thank God, my family, and all my public advocates for their love, support and encouragement during this difficult time. While the past five months have been a nightmare, the prayers, visits, calls, letters and rallies have helped me stay positive.
"To the Philly District Attorney's office, I'm grateful for your commitment to justice. I understand that many people of color across the country don't have that luxury and I plan to use my platform to shine a light on those issues.
"In the meantime, I plan to work closely with my legal team to overturn this unwarranted conviction and look forward to reuniting with my family and resuming my music career."
Mill was jailed in November 2017 for violating his probation by failing a drug test, traveling out of the region and getting arrested for fighting and other related offenses.?A team of lawyers and public relations consultants had waged a battle to get Mill freed on bail ever since.

By Julie Davis
HealthDay Reporter
(HealthDay News) -- A goal like having a flat stomach may give you the initial impetus to start exercising, but may not be enough to keep you on track.
For that you need "intrinsic motivation" -- being motivated from within by enjoying fitness and valuing it.
Below are key steps to building that drive to exercise.
1. Enjoy what you're doing -- find fitness activities you like.
The fact is many people don't have the internal motivation to work out, and say they'd rather do something else. The trick is finding a "something else" that just happens to have fitness benefits.
2. Become a master to feel comfortable and competent, and gain a sense of accomplishment.
A big motivation killer is not feeling adept at exercise. Since mastery is motivating, get instruction to become more proficient at your chosen activity. A few one-on-one training sessions can keep your head in the game.
3. Develop a plan and follow through -- no distractions.
Some people lose motivation because they don't follow through with their exercise plans. Make workout time sacred, and get rid of any hurdles in your way. That could mean hiring a babysitter or changing to a different class at the gym that gives you more time to get there from work.
4. Join a fitness group or exercise as a family to deepen your commitment to workouts.
Add a social component to make exercise more fun. You'll also be more motivated if you know others are depending on you to show up.
Finally, believe in yourself. You're more likely to engage in meaningful amounts of exercise if you feel that fitness is part of who you are.

NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) – A YouTube star is helping New York City live up to its reputation as a concrete jungle.
But as WCBS 880's Ethan Harp reported, the city is not impressed by his latest stunt.
“When I was driving around New York City, I hit a pothole with my car,” professional prankster Coby Persin posted on his YouTube channel. “My tire popped and I had to buy a new one.”
He claims that's what inspired him to fill some of the city's craters with nature.
“I'm going around with different-sized plants put in different-sized potholes, so New Yorkers avoid them,” Persin said.
Video shows his green thumb in action in the middle of the street – in areas like Radio City Music Hall. Cars can be seen swerving around the plants, which Persin pulled out minutes later, Harp reported.
The Department of Transportation found nothing pretty about the prank.
A spokesperson told WCBS 880 Persin put himself and drivers in danger. The spokesperson also noted the average response time for pothole repairs is a day and a half.
If you see a pothole, call 311.
In the International Science Contest, students from various universities of India and across the border have asked to find new and improve methods to remove the yellow stains of the Taj Mahal. The 8th International Natural Sciences Tournament (INST) of Russia is underway in Agra with India being represented by a team from the Mumbai University, and other countries like Singapore, Russia, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Belarus also participating in the competition.
Finding a new and improved method of removing the yellow stains of the Taj Mahal may be devised in the coming days as university students from India and elsewhere have been posted this problem at an international science contest underway in the Taj city. The eighth International Natural Sciences Tournament (INST) of Russia is underway in Agra with India being represented by a team from the Mumbai University. Other teams and jury have come from Singapore, Russia, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Belarus.
The three-day competition that started on Thursday requires students to solve a dozen difficult problems in the spheres of medicine, biology, physics, and chemistry. One of the problems is to propose a “new method” to remove the yellow pollution stains which have started to develop on “the snow-white cupola and the upper part of the facade” of the 17th-century monument. “Our mission is to bring real-world problem-solving skills to bright scientists around the globe. We believe the science to be not only an interesting subject to study but a real tool to change things around us, to create new products and solve ecology problems,” the tournament's founder Sergey Safonov said in a statement.
He said it was their belief that there is a lot of “under-evaluated talented students” in Asia, who should be helped to find their place in the science and industry. “That's why we brought the tournament to India, a country with well-developed industry, especially in pharmaceuticals,” he said. The INST originated in Russia's St. Petersburg, and its former participants launched many events in their cities on this model, covering topics such as biology, medicine, and engineering.
According to the INST press service's Dina Mostovaya, the tournament movement in Russia “became a gathering point for an elite of science, medicine and engineering students, resulting in new careers for top students, scientific collaboration…” and the organizers hope to help Indian universities to launch similar national events.
Prime Minister Hun Sen kicked off the Khmer New Year holiday on Friday by condemning the escalation of tensions in the Korean Peninsula and in Syria before using an allegory to caution against greed and the hunger for power.
Speaking at the opening ceremony for Angkor Sangkranta at Bayon Temple in the Angkor Archaeological Park in Siem Reap province, the prime minister said that increasing global tensions, exacerbated by U.S. airstrikes against Syrian air bases and increasing talk of war in North Korea, hit close to home for Cambodia.
“As a member of the United Nations, [Cambodia] shares her deep concern about the situation in the Middle East, especially the situation in Syria, and in North Korea,” he said.
“We ask for patience and to try to solve those disputes through negotiation.”
The prime minister appeared to condemn Syria's alleged use of chemical weapons in an attack earlier this month as well as the U.S.'s response of a missile attack on a Syrian air base.
“The activities of firing missiles or chemical weapons are tragedies,” he said.
“Cambodia had been a victim of this kind and clearly understands the difficulties of people from war-torn countries.”
Mr. Hun Sen has increased his criticism of the U.S. in recent months, frequently mentioning the damage inflicted by U.S. bombing campaigns during the Second Indochina War in the same breath as demanding a reprieve from Lon Nol-era war debt the U.S. insists Cambodia must repay.
The prime minister then put his own spin on a Cambodian folk tale, describing how two priests—one good, the other bad—died, with the former reincarnated as the king of the kingdom of gods, and the other into a leprosy-infected beggar.
The king descended to Earth to visit his friend, granting an escalating series of requests—first to become well again, then village chief, then commune chief, before eventually asking to control half of the god kingdom. Fed up with the former leper's demands, the king turns his friend back into a leper.
“If we compare to someone nowadays, there are people that are like that,” he said without naming names, before urging against reading too much into the metaphor.
“This is just a folktale. In everything, please don't be too greedy so that we can have cooperation…for the unity of our nation for generations to come,” he said.
“Otherwise it causes trouble.”

COCOA, Fla. (WESH) — The father of a 32-year-old woman killed while protesting the presence of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia told WESH 2 News that he forgives the man charged in his daughter's death.
Three people were killed and dozens were injured amid what is believed to be the largest group of white nationalists to come together in a decade to protest the city's decision to remove a Confederate monument. A car rammed into a crowd of protesters, killing Heather Heyer, and a state police helicopter crashed into the woods, leaving two troopers onboard dead.

Heather Heyer's father lives in Cocoa and told WESH 2 News that his daughter was the type of person who stood up for injustice wherever she saw it.
Mark Heyer said he learned of his daughter's death Saturday when Heather's mother called him.
“Through tears and from the hospital, she said ‘Our daughter's gone,' and I kind of lost it, I kind of freaked you know,” Mark Heyer said.
Heyer said he was not watching the news and did not know a riot had broken out in his daughter's hometown.
“My daughter was a strong opinionated woman that was willing to stand up for what she believed in. For her it wasn't lip service it was real,” Mark Heyer said of Heather Heyer.

Mark Heyer said he doesn't hold any ill will toward James Alex Fields Jr., the man who is believed to have been behind the wheel of the car that rammed into the crowd.
“I don't hold any ill will toward this young fellow who did this, he's stupid, OK. He's only 20 years old. It doesn't have enough sense to make a lifelong decision about nothing, you know,” Heyer said.
“He was misinformed, he was deceived and you know I forgive him flat out. I forgive him. The thing is, he's going to have to live with the consequences, and he's going to have to live knowing he took somebody's life for the rest of his life. I wouldn't wish that on nobody.”
Mark Heyer hopes that his daughter's death will bring about change.
“Everybody has a circle of influence, no matter how small it is. Affect those people around you positively. Give them a cup of coffee, buy them a sandwich, tell them a joke, give them a smile, bring joy into their life. You don't have to do the masses, do the people you deal with,” Mark Heyer said.
James Alex Fields Jr. was charged with second-degree murder and other counts.
The rally's purpose was to condemn a decision by the city to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.

OTTAWA — Canada has imposed new sanctions on Venezuela in the wake recommendations that the country's president Nicolas Maduro and his regime be referred to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.
Canada was the first country Tuesday to welcome the recommendations from a panel of legal experts convened by the Organization of American States, which over the past few months studied egregious examples of human rights abuses. On Wednesday, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland introduced new sanctions on 14 Venezuelan individuals connected to the Maduro regime, including the first lady Cilia Flores, bringing the total to 106.
Ahead of the G7 summit in Quebec next week, Canada is facing calls to take even more of a leadership role and ask the ICC for a formal investigation.
“I would like to see the states from the G7 agreeing to refer the matter of crimes against humanity to the International Criminal Court for a prospective investigation and prosecution,” said former Liberal Justice Minister Irwin Cotler, who was on the OAS panel. He held a press conference in Ottawa Wednesday alongside an all-party group of MPs and senators.
After hearing from victims, witnesses and experts on human rights crimes, the OAS panel found Maduro responsible for dozens of murders, thousands of extra-judicial executions, more than 12,000 cases of arbitrary detentions, more than 290 cases of torture, attacks against the judiciary and a “state-sanctioned humanitarian crisis” affecting hundreds of thousands of people, Cotler explained. Venezuela has been refusing aid, with the country's economy in a tailspin of hyper-inflation and food shortages worsening.

More than 1.1 million people have been displaced due to the ongoing crisis, which the United Nations has estimated is the largest forced migration in Latin American history.
“We have a persistent and pervasive culture of impunity finding expression in a massive assult on the rule of law. There is no independent judiciary. There is no independent prosecutors. There is no independent justice system. This is the arch-typical example of why a reference is needed, as to why the ICC was created,” Cotler said.
“The testimony that we heard in our public hearings, of the graphic examples of torture and rape and imprisonment, and then the humanitarian crisis — we can't forget that behind all these findings of fact and conclusions of law are suffering human beings. They need justice. They need relief. And this is a way to bring that remedy and hopefully that sense of justice not only for them but for the international community as a whole.”
Liberal MP Michael Levitt, who chairs a House of Commons subcommittee on international human rights, said he agrees with Cotler's call for Canada to refer the matter to the ICC. “This is not just a domestic crisis. It has far-reaching regional and international repercussions,” he said.
Global Affairs Canada said on Wednesday that the new sanctions come in response to “illegitimate and anti-democratic” presidential elections held in Venezuela on May 20.
In a statement responding to the OAS report on Tuesday, Freeland stopped short of announcing that Canada would ask for a formal investigation at the ICC. The court had already opened a preliminary examination in February, and Freeland said the report “will provide valuable information” to support it.
“We are appalled, though not surprised, by the evidence the panel found supporting the allegation that crimes against humanity have been committed in Venezuela. … It is because of the Maduro regime's ongoing abuse of its people and attacks on democracy that Canada has taken a series of punitive actions, including imposing targeted sanctions,” Freeland's statement said.
The crisis is one of the few issues on which G7 leaders seem to fully agree and on which the leaders have issued a joint statement ahead of the summit next week in Charlevoix, Que., which will feature the leaders of Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.
Leaders jointly rejected the presidential elections last week, saying that Maduro was trying to solidify an “authoritarian grip” amid the suffering of his people.
“We stand in solidarity with the people of Venezuela and call on the Maduro regime to restore constitutional democracy in Venezuela, schedule free and fair elections that can truly reflect the democratic will of the people, immediately release all political prisoners, restore the authority of the National Assembly and provide for full, safe and unhindered access by humanitarian actors.”

There are 60 National Parks across America. That's not counting the hundreds of National Monuments, historical sites, battlefields, memorials, trails, and more. When you count all of them together, the number of protected sites that fall under the US National Park system is well over 400. So it's not going to surprise anyone when we say: “There are scores of incredible sites worth exploring, in this nation. From sea to shining sea.”
Still, that point feels worth mentioning again, with summer rapidly approaching. So we thought we'd put together a list of the 12 US National Parks we love that don't get the big ticket acclaim of a Yellowstone or Olympic. These are the parks that are a little more off the beaten path, a little more unique, and 100 percent worth a visit this summer.
Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota
South Dakota is more than motorcycles and Mount Rushmore. The state is a summer vacay wonderland with endless forests for camping, mountains for climbing, rivers for floating, old-timey casinos for a little fun, and saloons for tipping back a cold one.
Wind Cave in South Dakota is a high plains wonderland. It's where the beauty of the open prairie meets the lush wilderness of the Black Hills. The park has major historical significance as the place where the American Bison was saved from extinction (with the help from the Bronx Zoo). The herd that's repopulated almost all of the American bison living today is still there, roaming what's left of the great American frontier.
Summer Vibes: Spacious. SoDak (not a thing) is a land of wide open plains, so get in the mood to have room to explore. This goes double if you're visiting Wind Cave. It's literally where the buffalo roam.

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. consumer prices rose in January at the fastest pace in nearly four years, strengthening the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year.
The Labor Department says consumer prices rose 0.6 percent last month, most since February 2013. A 7.8 percent jump in gasoline prices accounted for almost half the increase. Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, consumer inflation rose 0.3 percent.
Overall, consumer prices rose 2.5 percent from a year earlier, most since March 2012.
After remaining low following the 2007-2009 Great Recession, inflation is running above the Fed's 2 percent annual target.
The Fed left a key interest rate unchanged at its Jan. 31-Feb. 1 meeting. It said it needs more time to monitor the economy but still expects to raise rates gradually.
Hundreds of people are getting ready for a moonlight stroll – all in a good cause.
St Catherine's Hospice is preparing for its biggest annual fundraiser, the Moonlight and Memories walk.
Among those getting ready are is Collinson family from Lea, Preston.
Mum Jenni, her husband Daryl, and their children Madeleine, aged 13, Sophie, 12, and Theo, 10, are looking forward to a family night out with a difference.
With a 10-mile and four-mile route to choose from, the whole community will be welcomed into the hospice grounds of St Catherine's Park on the evening of Saturday, June 30, for the poignant sponsored trek.
Hairdresser Jenni says: “I did the Moonlight and Memories Walk a few years ago with a group of friends and loved it. I also took part in the Shine Night Walk London for Cancer Research UK, which is a night time marathon walk, and the children were really excited for me and wanted to join in. So the four-mile Moonlight and Memories Walk is perfect for us to do together as a family.”
Norman Cutler, fundraiser at St Catherine's Hospice, said: “Hundreds of people have already signed up to our biggest annual fundraiser, and we're really looking forward to seeing our grounds filled with supporters in our famous pink t-shirts ahead of the sponsored walk.”
Registration is £15 for adults and £10 for under-18s, with sponsorship raised helping to fund the specialist palliative and end-of-life care provided by St Catherine's Hospice.

Determined to avoid the embarrassing rules mess from a year ago, the USGA is shaking up the way it officiates the U.S. Open at Erin Hills.
It pledged to respond quicker and not wait to make a ruling.
"I think last year there were two things we fell short on — it took too long to make the ruling and it left uncertainty with the competition," said John Bodenhamer, the USGA's managing director of rules and competition. "I think should a similar circumstance happen, I think we are poised to move quickly."
The U.S. Open, as well as the USGA's other biggest events, will no longer have referees who walk with each group, a practice that dates to 1991. Instead, officials will be stationed at various spots on each hole around the course.
The biggest advancement is having four video monitor stations, along with the use of tablets, that will allow officials to review any rules discrepancies on the course to reach conclusions immediately.
That might have made it a lot easier on Dustin Johnson — and everyone else — last year at Oakmont.
Johnson's golf ball moved slightly as he stepped in for a 3-foot par putt on the fifth hole. He didn't think he caused it to move, called in the walking referee and no penalty was assessed. But when the USGA saw video, officials thought there might be a penalty.
They told Johnson when he was on the 12th tee, saying he might be penalized and they could review it after the round. That would have been fine except that it was the final round. Johnson played the last seven holes not knowing if he would be penalized, and thus not knowing the score.
It was a major gaffe, saved only by Johnson playing so well that he had a four-shot lead when he birdied the final hole to win the U.S. Open. After meeting with officials, he was given a one-shot penalty that affected only the margin of victory, not the name on the trophy.
The USGA has a five-member rules committee led by Thomas Pagel, the senior director of rules. Pagel will be the chief referee for the U.S. Open, who can make immediate decisions that would stand.
A repeat of the Johnson incident is unlikely this year, and not just because the greens at Erin Hills are nowhere near as fast as Oakmont's putting surfaces. The USGA introduced a local rule last year that if a golf ball or marker moves accidentally, the player puts it back without penalty.
Having video more readily available for review should help avoid uncertainty.
Bodenhamer said the rules committee — not always the player, in some cases — would be able to look at the video and quickly decide whether it's a penalty.
It was the most significant change for a U.S. Open that is desperate to have a smooth tournament. The previous year at Chambers Bay, the grass on the greens was starting to die before the U.S. Open began and at times on the weekend, players were putting through what amounted to matted dirt.
Jordan Spieth won when Johnson, needing a 12-foot eagle putt to win, three-putted for par to finish second. He missed a 4-foot birdie putt on the bumpy green.
Part of that could be attributed to weather in the Pacific Northwest that week.
As for Oakmont a year ago, that was a breakdown in communication and delivering the ruling at the right time.
"We not only learned from it, but we made changes," USGA executive director Mike Davis said. "And I think that's the way you have to approach anything that doesn't go right: 'How can we make it better? How can we make sure it doesn't happen in the future?'"
Our youngest child, Sean, walked across the stage in his graduation robe. Earlier in the day, he had been inducted into the Order of the Engineer and into Phi Beta Kappa, the honors society. Now, as he prepared to throw his mortarboard skyward, a thought crossed my mind: I might possibly be the worst parent in the world.
When he was younger, I'd been pretty good at the parenting thing. Hour after hour, year after year, we'd read to him — “The Very Hungry Caterpillar,” “Johnny Tremain,” one Harry Potter book after another. Then one night we came home to find him gluing together a 32-sided sphere of interlocking pentagons and triangles. We asked him what he was making. “An icosidodecahedron,” Sean explained. “It's an Archimedean solid.”
“That's so interesting,” my wife, Deirdre, said. “Is this for school?”
He just looked at her, perplexed. “School?” he said, as if the idea that you'd make an icosidodecahedron for any reason other than your own pleasure was unthinkable.
We'd been good parents, we hoped, and if we had fallen short on occasion — as most surely we had — we were still consoled that both of our children were, at the very least, imaginative and loving souls.
A Warren County teen has earned a first-degree black belt from Golden Dragon Karate and is the youngest student to ever earn the rank.
Sempai John Hudson Olson started at the school, 1100 East Boulevard in Alpha, in January 2009 when he was 7-years-old. Olson, now 15, became the youngest Sho-Dan first-degree black belt ever to receive the promotion, according to the school.
Representatives of Golden Dragon said Hudson was a junior black belt since November 2014 and has proven his loyalty to the school.
Olson also received an obi (belt) from Shureido, Okinawa, Japan (known as the birthplace of Karate) with his name written in Japanese on one side and "Golden Dragon Karate Dojo" written in Japanese on the other.
The belt also included a gold stripe, noting Olson's first-degree rank.
Olson often competes in karate tournaments throughout New Jersey and Pennsylvania, as well as travels to North Carolina to take part in karate summer camps.

The Walking Dead just threw its viewers for another loop in their latest mid-season finale by killing off a main character that everyone assumed was safe for years to come. Carl Grimes has been on the show since the very beginning and many expected him to assume the role of leader from his dad Rick eventually. That may still happen in the comics, but on the show we just learned that Carl is dying from a walker bite.
It was a surprising moment, one that caught most viewers by surprise. And it turns out it also caught actor Chandler Riggs by surprise as well, when he was told by The Walking Dead producers in June that he wasn't going to make it.
“I was really shocked too,” he said in an interview with FanFest. “I don't think me or my family or anyone on the cast or crew or anyone in the audience anywhere thought this was gonna happen, and this is how it was going to go down. Like you said, Carl has played such a big role, and it's a huge deviation from the comic. So it's definitely quite the shocker.”
While Chandler's parents don't sound like they were very impressed with the show's decision to kill his character off, Riggs seems to be taking it all in stride and is excited to branch out into other areas of the entertainment world like music and movies.
Bitcoin - a web-based "cryptocurrency" that has no central authority, relying instead on thousands of computers across the world that validate transactions and add new bitcoins to the system - jumped 2.5 percent to $1,022 on the Europe-based Bitstamp exchange, its highest since December 2013.
Though the digital currency has historically been highly volatile - a tenfold increase in its value in two months in late 2013 took it to above $1,100, before a hack on the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox exchange saw it plunge to under $400 in the following weeks - it has in the past two years been more stable.
Its biggest daily moves in 2016 were around 10 percent, still very volatile compared with fiat currencies, but markedly lower than the trading of 2013, which saw daily price swings of as much as 40 percent.
Bitcoin may have been boosted in the past year by increased demand in China on the back of a 7 percent annual fall in the value of the yuan in 2016, the Chinese currency's weakest showing in over 20 years. Data shows most bitcoin trading is done in China.
Bitcoin is used to move money across the globe quickly and anonymously and does not fall under the purview of any authority, making it attractive to those wanting to get around capital controls, such as China's.
It is also may appeal to those worried about a lack of supply of cash, such as in India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed high-denomination banknotes from circulation in November.
"The growing war on cash, and capital controls, is making bitcoin look like a viable, if high risk, alternative," said Paul Gordon, a board member of the UK Digital Currency Association and co-founder of Quantave, a firm seeking to make it easier for institutional investors to access digital currency exchanges.
Though bitcoin is still some way off the all-time high of $1,163 that it reached on the Bitstamp exchange in late 2013, there are now more bitcoins in circulation - 12.5 are added to the system every 10 minutes. Its total worth is at a record-high above $16 billion, putting its value at around the same as that of an average FTSE 100 company.

The U.S. Treasury Department, specifically its intelligence division, has been conducting a program of “domestic spying,” including accessing American citizens' financial records, sometimes for other intelligence agencies, according to reports observed by Buzzfeed News
Reportedly, officials at the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN, a bank regulator that combats crimes like money laundering and tracks information in a regularly updated database) have repeatedly warned (dating back to the Obama administration) of the issue. That is, that officials at the Treasury's Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) — which is tasked with monitoring suspicious financial activity that occurs outside the U.S. — are “illegally collecting and retaining domestic financial information from the banking database.” Here's more:
Some sources have also charged that OIA analysts have, in a further legal breach, been calling up financial institutions to make inquiries about individual bank accounts and transactions involving US citizens. Sources said the banks have complied with the requests because they are under the impression they are giving the information to FinCEN, which they are required to do.
Moreover, the OIA has allowed officers from other intelligence agencies, like the CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency, to temporarily transfer to the OIA for short periods of time and gain “unrestricted access to information on US citizens that they otherwise could not collect without strict oversight.”
Some treasury officials called the OIA's actions “domestic spying” and “an invasion of privacy.” Under a Reagan-era executive order, for intelligence agencies to operate within the United States and collect information on U.S. citizens, they must set up and follow strict guidelines to protect the civil rights of Americans. These guidelines have to be approved by the Attorney General and director of national intelligence before the agency can conduct operations. The OIA has never completed this process.
After officials at FinCEN pointed out that the OIA was doing this, FinCEN was cut off from various classified networks. As such, FinCEN has been hindered from helping law enforcement during several events, which also prevented it from “fully complying” with the Senate's Russia probe.

A scheme to move a library into a leisure centre is on track to be completed later in the year, say council chiefs.
Work to upgrade Peterlee Leisure Centre and re-locate the town's library is on schedule, with building work set to be completed in autumn this year.
The leisure centre is benefitting from more than £2 million of investment, which will see a new, modern library at the venue as well as a refurbished changing room and revamped reception.
A number of consultations were held last year, where leisure centre users were asked for their views on what they would like to see included.
Following further consultation in February this year, the decision has now been made to build a new sauna cabin within the pool complex, replacing the old facility which was located elsewhere in the venue.
Coun Audrey Laing, from Peterlee, said: “We know the sauna is highly valued by users and we have listened closely to the feedback provided.
“It is fantastic that an updated facility will be offered as part of the refurbishment and we hope that it will encourage more visitors to the pool and the venue as a whole.”
It is expected that the new sauna will be open in autumn, at the same time as the new library.
Coun Ossie Johnson, cabinet member for tourism, culture, leisure and rural issues, said: “The investment into Peterlee Leisure Centre is great for the town and we are looking forward to the work being completed later this year.”

Malaysia Airlines Berhad (MAB) is considering launching new service to Europe using some of the Airbus A350s the carrier is scheduled to receive next year. MAB is currently “in active negotiations” with 12 airports regarding potential new service, including two in Europe, an airline spokeswoman said. However, she cautions that, “As of now, we have not got the right deal on costs and airport slots” on any of these new routes. Additional long-haul routes are in play ...
South African police kill teen during anti-graft protests
South African police said on Tuesday one of their officers had shot dead a teenager during anti-corruption protests which have forced the president to cut short a foreign trip.
Riots over alleged government corruption and poor public services erupted last week in the North West province, where cars were set ablaze and shops looted in the first wave of unrest to face President Cyril Ramaphosa, who came to power in February.
“A 16-year-old boy was found dead during a violent protest yesterday evening in Taung,” provincial police spokesman Sabata Mokgwabone told AFP.
“He was shot dead by the police,” police watchdog spokesman Moses Dlamini told AFP, adding that investigators had been dispatched to the town where the situation was “still very volatile”.
“At this stage we are trying to gather information about what happened,” said Dlamini, of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate.
After prematurely returning home from a Commonwealth summit in London on Friday and going straight into talks with local provincial leaders, Ramaphosa appealed for calm and promised a “speedy” resolution of the crisis.
Following a lull over the weekend, new protests broke out on Monday — this time in Taung town, 300 kilometres (about 200 miles) from the provincial capital Mahikeng which was the epicentre of last week's protests.
Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets during clashes with the protesters.
The North West province has been a hotbed of unrest due to frustration over lack of housing, health services and jobs.
Much of the anger has been directed at Supra Mahumapelo, the provincial premier, who is accused of involvement in graft scandals that have engulfed the ruling African National Congress party.
He is accused of diverting 1.5 million rand ($120,000) from government coffers to buy cattle for former president Jacob Zuma.
His son allegedly received a 1.1 million rand pilot-training bursary from the state arms manufacturer under suspicious circumstances.
Ramaphosa, who took over from Zuma three months ago, has vowed to crack down on government corruption.

YULETIDE: Passengers stranded in Lagos
By Bose Adelaja
Lagos, yesterday, experienced light vehicular traffic on most major roads in the metropolis, while there was human traffic on some roads.
Ikorodu/CMS, Oshodi, Apapa, Ikeja and Mile 2-Badag­ry Expressways recorded light traffic, as few commercial motorcycles, buses and taxis were seen plying the routes.
On Ikorodu/CMS route, few Bus Rapid Transit, BRT, were seen providing services to the commuters at bus stops, such as Ikorodu, Mile 12, Ketu, Ojota and environs.
Some commuters, who bared their minds, lamented that they wasted much time at bus stops in their bid to visit their friends and families.
They, however, said there was no increase in fares unlike days before the festive period.
At Oshodi, a commuter, Bernad James, said he experienced difficulty boarding a luxurious bus from Oshodi to Mile 12 as few of the buses were available to provide services for so many commuters on the route.
He said: “I made a mistake to take my three children along with me, because there are so many commuters on the road with few commercial buses. There was no increase in fares, but you have to run after the buses to avoid being stranded.”
At the inter-state level, Ojota Park recorded low turnout of passengers, although fare to Ado-Ekiti was at N2,500.

Arewa/Biafra Quit Notice: ”Stay Where You Are” – Lai Mohammed To Nigerians
The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed has asked Nigerians not to panic or find alternatives outside the country in the face of the recent threats by the Arewa and Biafra groups.
The Minister stated this on Wednesday while briefing State House correspondents after the Federal Executive Council meeting in Abuja.
“The idea is not just to assure Nigerians that we are doing something about it but also to give comfort to all Nigerians that this matter is completely under control,” he said.
Mr Mohammed gave strong assurances that the Federal Government was putting measures in place measure to address the issue.
He further reiterated that Nigeria remains safe for every citizen and everyone is free to live in any desired part of the country.
“Any Nigerian anywhere is safe. The security authorities are completely on top of the matter and they will deal decisively with any conduct that they believe is going to create instability in the country,” the Minster said.
“So there is no need for anybody to panic, there is no need for anybody to move from any part of the country. The security agencies are on top of the matter and there is no reason for anybody to panic,” he added.

The flood waters have also washed debris and all kinds of filth unto the streets
Many parts of Ghana's capital, Accra, have been submerged in flood waters, curtailing vehicular movement after few hours of rain on Friday morning. Most drivers have been forced to make a detour, while others have parked their vehicles due to the pool of flood waters on major highways.
Areas such as Teshie-Nungua, Lapaz, Shiashie, Darkuman and Kaneshie have been badly affected. The flooding situation has resulted in a gridlock in areas such as Kaneshie, Tetteh Quarshie and Lapaz.
The flood waters have also washed debris and all kinds of filth unto the streets.
The flood raises questions about governments; past and present's competence to address the problem which has become a perennial one.
Following a downpour in February 2017 that wrecked havoc in the area, the Works and Housing Minister, Samuel Atta Akyea, said the country requires $700 million to permanently fix the issue.
But before the amount is raised to commence works to halt the floods, city authorities and the Greater Accra Regional Minister, have contracted a private company to dredge some major drains in the capital to allow water to flow freely whenever it rains.

The US Department of Justice (DOJ) sent threatening letters to 23 so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions last week, including Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, as Attorney General Jeff Sessions throws his weight behind the Trump administration's deportation agenda.
The letters promise federal subpoenas and threaten local police funding for cities where local law enforcement fails to share information with federal immigration officers. The funding at stake, Byrne JAG grants, are the leading source of federal funding for state and local governments and is a major funding source for state and local law enforcement, prosecution, and courts.
Squeezing sanctuary cities to carry out this administration's unsound deportation plan undermines rights and threatens public safety. When local law enforcement does share information with immigration authorities, immigrant communities stop reporting crimes – making everyone less safe.
Last year, the Trump administration made 40 percent more immigration arrests in communities around the country, uprooting people with deep ties to the United States and putting their families and communities in turmoil. Most of these arrests by immigration authorities occurred after some type of run-in with law enforcement – even something so small as a traffic stop or marijuana possession. In an effort to ensure that everybody has access to police protection, sanctuary cities have adopted policies to ensure that minimal contact with the criminal justice system does not result in deportation.
Courts in Chicago, California, and Philadelphia have issued rulings blocking some of these moves, and the administration has vowed to fight the matter in court. With these letters, however, Sessions and the Trump administration is escalating their bullying of localities that are – rightly – making public safety their first priority. Indeed, a recent study found that crime rates are actually lower in sanctuary jurisdictions than in those cities that partner, formally or informally, with the federal government on immigration enforcement. Forcing these cities to entangle policing with federal immigration enforcement means eroding trust in local police and, ultimately, sending people to detention centers rife with abuses. The good news is that local communities have the power to – and should – push back and make their leaders prioritize public safety and families.
According to fashion trade publication Drapers, Amazon UK recently snapped up senior design and buying experts from leading high street retailers as part of an ongoing recruitment drive for its fashion business. Karen Peacock, former head of design for womenswear and accessories at M&S, and Primark's menswear buying director Glen George recently joined the company, heaping further pressure its high street competition.
Amazon's own-label clothing is now said to be in production and could launch in the UK as soon as this spring. To be clear, Amazon UK already sells women's underwear under its Iris & Lilly brand, while Amazon US has at least seven trademarked brands, including: James & Erin, Franklin & Freeman, Franklin Tailored, Lark & Ro, North Eleven, Scout + Ro, and Society New York. Amazon is no stranger to fashion, but the company has only recently begun looking to increase its presence in the market.
As we've reported before, many high-fashion labels are reluctant to sell clothing via Amazon because it doesn't fit with or might devalue their brand. Some companies, like footwear designer Birkenstock, have also pulled their products citing a rise in counterfeit goods and "a constant stream of unidentifiable unauthorized resellers."
By taking matters into its own hands, Amazon may choose to list thousands of its own products alongside other labels, giving customers a choice between low-to-middle priced items and more valuable garments marketed by brands themselves. Free next-day Prime deliveries might help, too.
I should have done this sooner, but I had to mourn the loss of my friend before I could.
We are blessed to continue on in 58's life with his daughter-in-law since she has joined NV ♥ Please everyone give her a big NV (((hug))) and welcome her into your nations.

Jakarta's Christian governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (C), better known as "Ahok", flanked by his wife Veronica (R) and son Nicholas (L) show off their ballot papers in Jakarta on February 15, 2017 (AFP Photo/GOH CHAI HIN)
Jakarta's Christian governor was heading for a tough run-off against a Muslim opponent in city elections seen as a test of religious tolerance in Muslim-majority Indonesia after a tight first round Wednesday.
Basuki Tjahaja Purnama held a narrow lead, according to private pollsters, despite being on trial for blasphemy, but is seen as unlikely to win in April's second round against ex-education minister Anies Baswedan, who came a close second and will attract more Muslim votes.
Third candidate Agus Yudhoyono, another Muslim challenger and the son of a former president, trailed far behind.
Baswedan said "Thanks be to God!" on hearing he looked on course to become governor of the megacity of 10 million -- but Purnama, who has won support with his determination to clean up Jakarta, signalled he was ready for a fight.
"This is not over yet," he told cheering supporters at his campaign headquarters in Jakarta. "Some pollsters said we were the candidates no one would vote for," he said, referring to himself and his running mate. "We ended up in the lead."
Over 100 polls to elect local leaders were taking place across Indonesia Wednesday but the race in the capital was the most hotly contested, with the top job in Jakarta seen as a stepping stone to victory in the 2019 presidential polls.
The stakes in the vote have been raised by allegations that Purnama -- the city's first non-Muslim governor for half a century and its first ethnic Chinese leader -- insulted the Koran.
The claims drew hundreds of thousands of conservative Muslims onto the streets of Jakarta in major protests last year, and Purnama has been put on trial in a case criticised as unfair and politically motivated.
Purnama, known by his nickname Ahok, was not barred from running but his popularity was dented for a period. The vote is now seen as a test of whether pluralism and a tolerant brand of Islam in the world's most populous Muslim-majority country are being eroded.
- 'Needs a miracle' -
Once the favourite to win the gubernatorial election, Purnama was on about 43 percent to Baswedan's 39 in Wednesday's first round, meaning no candidate had passed the threshold needed to avoid a run-off, according to early vote tallies by private pollsters.
The official results are not expected for a few weeks but the early tallies, called "quick counts", are generally thought reliable.
Despite his upbeat remarks, analysts warn Purnama is unlikely to win a second round against a candidate who has appealed to voters disillusioned by the governor's alleged blasphemy and controversially courted a hardline group that organised the protests against him.
"At this stage, it will be a miracle if Ahok wins," said Tobias Basuki, a political analyst from Jakarta think-tank the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, adding it was unlikely the first round votes for Yudhoyono would go to Purnama.
Observers also warn that any run-off between Purnama and Baswedan could stoke religious tensions further after months of a dirty campaigning.
"The tense situation will continue until April -- this kind of thing is dangerous," said Burhanuddin Muhtadi of pollster Indikator.
Campaigning was marked by a flood of "fake news" which has mainly targeted Purnama, and included claims that a free vaccination programme he backed was a bid to make girls infertile and reduce the population.
In the event that Purnama wins and is convicted of blasphemy, which could see him sentenced to up to five years in prison, he would not automatically be barred from holding office and could avoid jail for a long time by filing successive appeals.
Purnama's troubles began in September when he said in a speech that his rivals were tricking people into voting against him by using a Koranic verse, which some interpret as meaning Muslims should only choose Muslim leaders.
The controversy is a high-profile example of the religious intolerance that has become more common in Indonesia, 90 percent of whose 255 million inhabitants are Muslim.
Purnama won popularity for trying to improve traffic-choked and chaotic Jakarta by cleaning up rivers and demolishing red-light districts, although his combative style and controversial slum clearances sparked some opposition.
The Bureau of National Investigations (BNI), Wednesday invited the Principal, Accountant, and Administrator of the Tepa Nursing and Midwifery Training College in the Ahanti Region.
Information available to Joy News is that a team from the BNI and police went to the College to drop invitation letters for the Principal, Victoria Amoah and Accountant; Richard Asamoah, both of who were unavailable.
Madam Amoah was not on campus but some sources said Mr Asamoah who was in the washrooms on campus disappeared mysteriously.
Investigations have uncovered irregularities in admissions and financial transactions at the College.
Luv News checks revealed, among others that there are shady deals in fuel administration by the management, which is draining the state of huge sums of money into private pockets.
Ministry of Health payment vouchers sighted by Luv News' Erastus Asare Donkor showed that the Principal spent GHS29,150 as travel expenses for herself and her driver.
The figure excludes the cost of fuel for three official trips to Accra. A journey to Accra by Madam Amoah and her driver on January 5, 2016, to collect scratch cards for the institution cost GHS19,450 minus fuel.
On another payment voucher, expenses for similar day's journey to Accra by the Principal on January 13, 2016, were quoted at GHS6,700 besides fuel.

Other visits captured featured GHS3,000 as personal expenses to Accra.
Fuel vouchers intercepted by Luv News also shows that Mrs Amoah and the College accountant Richard Asamoah together draw 240 gallons of fuel at the expense of the state every month from Star Oil Company.
Hundreds of fake receipts issued to cover a non-refundable interview and result verification fees paid by applicants between 2012 and 2016 were also discovered in the investigation.
Students of the College have been demanding answers for the whereabout of over GHS52,000 they paid as matriculation fees over five years.
According to them, though each student paid GHS50 between 2011 and 2015, they were never matriculated neither has their monies been refunded to them.
The College has been without a Board for three years and Mrs Amoah stands accused of unilateral decisions in admissions and allocations of resources in a manner concerned stakeholders say is not transparent.
In a quick reaction, the C/Sup of Ahafo Ano Division, T.K Tindow Kulffai, wrote to the three saying, “My attention has been drawn to the mentioned case from a Peace FM News on 12/0617 to the effect that some students of the school paid fees to the institution but were given fake receipt.”
“You are therefore invited together with your Accountant and Administrative Officer to meet this command on 15/06/17 at 09:00hrs for a discussion,” the letter said.
It also implored the three to treat as urgent.
SARASOTA, Fla. (WFLA) — As students head back to school in Sarasota, the police department wants to remind everyone, you are now sharing the road with students.
Students are out there on buses, teens may be driving to school, and many students walk or ride bikes.
The Sarasota Police Department has been using social media to remind people of the traffic laws now that school is back in session.
In Sarasota, all school zones are 15 mph and police warn if you don't follow the law it will cost you.
“For example, if you are caught speeding in a school zone your fine can vary from anywhere from $150 to $460, depending on how fast you were going and if you decide to go to traffic school or not. Again, it is all about the safety of our kids and our community,” said Genevieve Judge, Sarasota Police Department.
Be sure to watch WFLA News Channel 8 from 4:30 to 7 a.m. during the month of August. Every morning, we'll bring you a special back-to-school story to help you and your family prepare for the school year.

CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Ashleigh Barty and Daria Gavrilova will lead Australia in its Fed Cup match against Ukraine, while Ukraine's top-ranked player Elina Svitolina will not be competing.
Tennis Australia said Thursday that No. 16 Barty and No. 25 Gavrilova will be joined by Casey Dellacqua and Destanee Aiava for the World Group II first-round match in Canberra on Feb. 10-11.
Australia captain Alicia Molik said "this is one of the strongest Fed Cup teams we've had in many years."
Ukraine prevented Australia from reaching the eight-nation World Group in February of last year, winning 3-1 in Kharkiv. The Canberra winner will play off against one of the four losers in the World Group first round for a place in the final eight.
Svitolina, a quarterfinalist at the Australian Open who is ranked No. 3, is not making the trip to Canberra.
The Fed Cup said on its website that Marta Kostyuk, a 15-year-old qualifier who made the third round at the Australian Open, will lead Ukraine, joined by Lyudmyla Kichenok, Nadiia Kichenok, Dasha Lopatetskaya and captain Mikhail Filima.
A SpaceX rocket is ready to deliver one of the most high-tech payloads ever to the International Space Station.
The launch is scheduled for 12:31 p.m. ET. on Monday from NASA's Kennedy Space Center is Florida.
It marks the 12th unmanned resupply mission that SpaceX -- the private space exploration company headed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk -- has conducted for NASA since 2012.
Cargo missions are always packed with some interesting payloads -- typically several tons of experiment equipment, food and other provisions.
But Monday's mission will carry something the space station has never seen before: A supercomputer built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, dubbed the "Spaceborne Computer."
If it works, it could be the most powerful commercial computer ever to operate in space.
Astronauts aboard the space station already have a bunch of devices you'd find at your local electronics store -- including HP laptops.
But a supercomputer is something different. It's a much more powerful piece of hardware that can crunch massive amounts of data and send the results to other computers in just moments.
According to Mark Fernandez, the HPE engineer who is heading up this new experiment, the space-bound supercomputer will have the ability to make one trillion calculations in a single second -- about 30 to 100 times more powerful than your average desktop computer.
Julie Robinson, the chief scientist for NASA's space station program, said if this supercomputer can function in the harsh conditions of space -- it'll be very exciting news for companies down here on earth.
Robinson points out that a huge point of interest for the private sector is taking high-quality satellite images of earth in order to track things like crop growth or oil exploration.
"What's happening is -- just as your TV now has so much more resolution -- the same thing is happening with [satellite imagery]," she said.
But the high-definition images require 200 to 300 times more data, which can clog up the communication pipeline between earth and space. That's where a supercomputer on board the space station would become hugely valuable, Robinson told CNNMoney.
"If you can process the data on board [the space station], you then only need to send down a subset of the data that's actually needed," she said.
Will the supercomputer work?
We'll find out soon enough. After launch on Monday, SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft will detach from the top portion of the rocket. It'll then fire up its own engines and spend about two days traveling through orbital space.
Then, it'll dock with the space station, and the astronauts on board can collect the payload.
Fernandez said HPE has volunteered to have its payload removed last, so it'll be a few days into September by the time the supercomputer makes its way onto the space station and is plugged in.
"If it powers up, that's going to be my first relief. I will be very excited then," Fernandez told CNNMoney.
Hussain wins APC ticket for Osun West bye-election
Mudashiru Hussain on Wednesday emerged the Progressives Congress (APC) candidate for the July 8 bye-election in Osun West senatorial district.
He won the primary election held at the De Distinguished Event Centre, Egbedore local government area of the state.
The Speaker of the Zamfara State House of Assembly, Sanusi Rikiji, who led the screening committee, declared Hussein winner of the election after polling 2, 412 out of 2,413 total valid votes.
2, 560 delegates participated in the poll.
Hussain had twice survived disqualification from the APC Screening Committee and the Appeal Committee but was cleared for the election by the party's National Working Committee (NWC) who intervened in the dispute.
He was given the party's ticket as sole aspirant following the defection of late Senator Isiaka Adeleke's younger brother, Ademola, to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Tuesday.
Adeleke also secured the PDP ticket on Wednesday.

BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors have charged two Syrian men with fighting for terror organizations in their home country.
Abdulmalk A., 30, is accused of joining a combat unit of the Nusra Front extremist group in 2012. The charge says he became a commander for the extremist group in eastern Syria, where he participated in the capture of gas fields and the town of Tabka, including its military airport. In 2014, he allegedly joined the Islamic State group and engaged in combat operations.
Anas Ibrahim A.S., 26, is accused of also joining the Nusra Front in 2012 and participating in the takeover of an ammunition depot belonging to Syrian President Bashar Assad's troops.
Federal prosecutors said Monday that both men, whose last names were not released, were arrested in Germany in May.
Denver-based Frontier Airlines has agreed to a flow-through program for Trans States Airlines (TSA) pilots, giving the mainline carrier feed for its aggressive expansion plans, while the regional carrier gets a benefit to help it attract more pilot applicants.
The deal paves the way for TSA pilots to flow up to Frontier as first officers in as little as two years.
“With forecasted retirements, it's no secret that the demand for highly qualified pilots will grow over the next several years,” Frontier COO Jim Nides said. “This new partnership helps address our future pilot staffing needs while providing pilots entering the workforce a certainty for their careers.”
Frontier is in expansion mode, with a target of serving 50 million passengers with a 200-aircraft Airbus narrowbody fleet by 2026. The carrier currently serves more than 80 destinations and operates 300 flights per day with 80 A320-family aircraft, a mix of ceos and neos. Frontier, part of privately held Indigo Partners, does not release detailed traffic or financial information.
The agreement gives Missouri-based TSA a leg up on competitors that do not have flow-through agreements, and aligns with the carrier's existing operation. Frontier is the third-largest carrier at Denver International Airport with an 11% share of traffic in 2017, US Transportation Department figures show, and—like Trans States—has a pilot base in the city.
“Judging by the popularity of our growing Denver crew base with our crews, we expect Frontier's significant presence in Denver to be very attractive to our pilot group,” Trans States chief pilot Lee Stelzner said.
The agreement makes qualified Trans States pilots eligible immediately. First officers must complete a minimum of two years' active service with Trans States, while pilots who have upgraded to captain must complete a minimum of one year of active service after upgrading, Trans States said.

Jonathan did nothing for Igbos – Amaechi tackles the former president
Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, on Tuesday stated that Igbos benefited nothing from former president, Goodluck Jonathan, even though they massively supported him in 2011.

Over 20,000 CEO, Equity Analyst and Money Manager Interviews
The authorities in Ukraine have been sharply criticised for faking the murder of a Russian dissident journalist in Kiev. An official from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said Ukraine was spreading “false information”.
Reporters Without Borders said it was “part of an information war”.
Ukraine said it had acted to foil a Russian plot to kill Arkady Babchenko. Moscow said it was a provocation.
Babchenko, a 41-year-old critic of the Kremlin, sprang a major surprise when he arrived at a press conference in Kiev on Wednesday – the day after he was reported dead.
The head of Ukraine's security service, Vasyl Hrytsak, said an elaborate sting operation had been set up to catch hitmen paid by Russian forces. Police reported making one arrest.
Relations between Kiev and Moscow have been tense since Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014 and was accused of covertly backing rebels in the bloody conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Why is Ukraine being criticised?
Ukraine was accused of undermining the credibility of journalists.
Harlem Desir, the OSCE's representative on the freedom of the media, said: “I deplore the decision to spread false information on the life of a journalist. It is the duty of the state to provide correct information to the public.”
“Reporters Without Borders expresses its sharp indignation on learning of the Ukrainian secret service's manipulation carried out as part of an information war,” said Christophe Deloire, the group's head.
“It is always very dangerous for states to play with facts and especially on the backs of journalists.”
Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova described the Ukrainian operation as “a masquerade” done for “propagandistic effect”.
How did the story develop?
Babchenko's wife said on Tuesday she had found her husband at the entrance to their apartment block with bullet wounds in his back, and he was reported to have died in an ambulance later.
But on Wednesday there were gasps at a Kiev press conference when Babchenko entered the room.
“There was no other way,” he said.
Babchenko later tweeted to say he would “die at 96” after “dancing on Putin's grave”, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said Kiev would offer protection to Babchenko and his family. “It is unlikely that Moscow will calm down,” he added.
Was Babchenko a marked man?
The journalist fled Russia in 2017 after writing about the crash of a Russian military passenger jet in which 92 people died.
He said his Facebook post, in which he described Russia as an “aggressor”, had led to death threats from the Russian state.
Babchenko said he had been informed a month ago about an alleged Russian plot against him and had agreed to co-operate with Ukraine's counter-operation.
Mr Hrytsak alleged that Russian security forces had recruited a Ukrainian citizen to find hitmen.
He said the citizen had approached several acquaintances, offering $30,000 (£22,600) for the killing, one of whom revealed the plot to the security services.
Recent high-profile murders in Kiev
CARDIFF, Wales (AP) — Worcester wing Josh Adams will make his debut for Wales against Scotland in Six Nations rugby in Cardiff on Saturday.
Adams, the leading try-scorer in the English Premiership with nine, joins six Scarlets in the backline chosen on Tuesday.
Cohesion was a tipping factor in picking Rhys Patchell as the starting flyhalf ahead of the more pragmatic Gareth Anscombe, who was in the reserves. Patchell, capped five times, will continue his club combination with scrumhalf Gareth Davies.
With eight front-line players out, seven of them British Lions including Sam Warburton, Taulupe Faletau, George North, Jonathan Davies, Dan Biggar, Liam Williams, and Dan Lydiate, the Welsh selectors went with known combinations in an effort to compensate for lack of experience.
There are 10 Scarlets in the 15, including the front row.
Ross Moriarty, who suffered nerve damage in his back in the first match of the Lions tour in New Zealand and didn't return to action until this month, makes a timely return to No. 8. Plus, openside flanker Josh Navidi and blindside Aaron Shingler, who started together three times in the autumn tests, have been retained, leaving Lions flanker Justin Tipuric in the reserves.
"We know what a quality player Ross is, it's great he is back and available and we are looking forward to seeing his explosive ball carrying on Saturday," coach Warren Gatland said in a statement.
"Rhys and Gareth have been training really well over the last couple of weeks. It was a tough call between them, Rhys has started most of his games for the Scarlets at 10, we are really happy with his form and the combination with Gareth at nine.
"For this opening game, we looked at a lot of combinations, especially the front row. It is exciting to see Samson (Lee) back playing well and the familiarity of the Scarlets front row will be important."

Wales: Leigh Halfpenny, Josh Adams, Scott Williams, Hadleigh Parkes, Steff Evans, Rhys Patchell, Gareth Davies; Ross Moriarty, Josh Navidi, Aaron Shingler, Alun Wyn Jones (captain), Cory Hill, Samson Lee, Ken Owens, Rob Evans.

Zola Leaves Birmingham Post
Chelsea legend Gianfranco Zola has resigned from his managerial role at Birmingham, the championship club has confirmed.
Zola's last game was a 2-0 loss to Burton Albion, leaving them three points outside the relegation zone.
Zola was appointed as manager when Birmingham was seventh on the table. He won only two match so far, amassing only 13 points from his 22 games in charge.
His loss on Easter Monday led to more fan unrest and his resignation was made known one hour after the match against Burton Albion.
Zola faced the press soon after the announcement and he said: “I am sorry because obviously I came here with huge expectations, from the club and myself.
“Results unfortunately haven't been good and I take full responsibility for that. I am the first one to be disappointed with the results.
“It's not that I like quitting but I feel like this club deserves the best chance. If I feel like I cannot help these players why stay – it's better that I leave and let somebody else do that.”

The Bui Power Authority says it erred when it purchased 40 Ford Ranger Double Pick-ups at the cost of $1,345,000 in 2013, without the approval of a Tender Committee.
The power generator has admitted it breached the procurement law in its transaction.
Acting Bui Power Authority CEO, Fred Oware told Parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC), the contract was awarded without the constitution of a tender committee.
He said it was after the deal that the Authority made the call for a tender board to be constituted.
The Authority has been cited in the 2015 Auditor General's report for various financial irregularities.
In 2013, the power generator ordered 40 Ford vehicles from Mechanical Lloyd at a unit cost of $33,650.
An initial amount of $504,750 was paid on December 24, 2013 for 25 pick-ups. Subsequent payments were made but these were done without the approval of a tender committee.
Section 17 (1) of the Public Procurement Act, 2003 (Act 663) mandates state entities to establish their own Tender Committees to supervise their transactions.
But the purchase of the 40 Ford vehicles was done in breach of the law.
“I don't think there will be any disagreement about [a breach of the law] to the extent that there wasn't [a Tender Committee],” Mr Oware told the lawmakers.
He said subsequent to the formation of the Committee, all transactions made were done in accordance to the procurement law.
When asked about the state of the vehicles, Mr Oware said: “they are on the road working and we don't have any problem with them.”
China on Thursday launched its first ever space telescope to observe black holes, pulsars and gamma-ray bursts. Through the telescope, scientists will also study how to use pulsars for spacecraft navigation, and search for gamma-ray bursts corresponding to gravitational waves.
The 2.5-tonne Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT) was launched via a Long March-4B rocket from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in Gobi Desert at 11 a.m., reports Xinhua news agency.
The HXMT, dubbed Insight, was sent into an orbit of 550 km above the earth to help scientists better understand the evolution of black holes, and the strong magnetic fields and the interiors of pulsars.
The result of the wisdom and efforts of several generations of Chinese scientists, Insight is expected to push forward the development of space astronomy and improve space X-ray detection technology in China.
The unprecedented flow of leaks coming out of the American intelligence community about President Donald Trump and members of his inner circle does not appear to be stemming anytime soon. Tonight, the New York Times published a report based on the account of anonymous U.S. intelligence officials detailing how “phone records and intercepted calls show that members of Donald J. Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election.” The Times notes that U.S. intelligence “intercepted the communications around the same time that they were discovering evidence that Russia was trying to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee.”
The National Security Agency, which monitors the communications of foreign intelligence services, initially captured the communications between Mr. Trump's associates and Russians as part of routine foreign surveillance. After that, the F.B.I. asked the N.S.A. to collect as much information as possible about the Russian operatives on the phone calls, and to search through troves of previous intercepted communications that had not been analyzed.
…
But the intercepts alarmed American intelligence and law enforcement agencies, in part because of the amount of contact that was occurring while Mr. Trump was speaking glowingly about the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. At one point last summer, Mr. Trump said at a campaign event that he hoped Russian intelligence services had stolen Hillary Clinton's emails and would make them public.
The officials said the intercepted communications were not limited to Trump campaign officials, and included other associates of Mr. Trump. On the Russian side, the contacts also included members of the Russian government outside of the intelligence services, the officials said. All of the current and former officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the continuing investigation is classified.
Justin Bieber may be an international star, but he's not above hitting on a cute girl via direct message.
Jessica Gober, a 22-year-old from Savannah, Georgia, claimed that the singer messaged the gym where she works after they posted a Boomerang of her promoting an energy drink on their Instagram.
“Who is that girl ? In ur the latest post,” Bieber wrote, adding a heart emoji, according to Gober's screenshot of the message.
Gober told Buzzfeed that she was shocked to discover that the message came from the 23-year-old pop star's verified account, especially given that the Instagram account was not frequently used.
“We were like how in the world did he see this random post,” she said. “We only had 70 followers and had posted 5 times previous to this.”
Bieber's representative did not respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.
Did this actually just happen... lmao
Justin Bieber just messaged the gym that I work at and asked who I was hahahaha WTF pic.twitter.com/mktcdB1iDP — Jessi (@jessicagober) August 9, 2017
I've got everything I need right here ???? pic.twitter.com/mET9XXkM8d — Jessi (@jessicagober) August 10, 2017
Gober posted images of the screenshots to her Twitter, and they quickly went viral.
However, the fitness and nutrition coach said she wasn't interested in reaching out to Bieber. She followed up her previous Twitter post with snaps of herself and her boyfriend.
“I've got everything I need right here,” she captioned the post.
“I didn't post the pictures of my boyfriend and because I thought that Justin Bieber wanted to ‘get with me,' ” she told Buzzfeed. “I posted them in response to everyone commenting that I ‘ruined my chances with Justin by tweeting the screenshots.' Either way I didn't want a ‘chance' because I am perfectly happy with my boyfriend.”
Gober said that her boyfriend, like herself and her family, think the situation is “very random and shocking.” However, she doesn't hold anything against the singer.
“We didn't think Justin Bieber was being creepy, the gym did respond to him on Instagram,” she said. “I don't think he had any inappropriate intentions by simply asking who I was.”
Bieber canceled the remainder of his Purpose world tour last month and penned an emotional letter to fans in the wake of the decision.
“He needed to take a break and just focus on himself. He is doing better already,” a source told PEOPLE. “He is focused on his spiritual journey. He wants to be stronger mentally.”
Just your average Joe Trudeau
Another day, another stumble from White House press secretary Sean Spicer in pronouncing a world leader's name. After appearing to call Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull “Malcolm Trumble”—twice—Spicer made note of Monday's much-hyped first meeting between Donald Trump and Justin Trudeau in his briefing, but managed to call Trudeau “Joe.” Perhaps he just hadn't had his morning cup of Justin yet.
He says, she says, Flynn goes
Michael Flynn is finally out as national security advisor after misleading White House officials over conversations with Russian officials. Press secretary Sean Spicer said the president asked for Flynn's resignation; Trump's advisor Kellyanne Conway said it was Flynn's decision. Alternative facts?
The invitation stands
Nearly two million people signed an online petition to un-invite Trump from a state visit to the United Kingdom, but it's all for naught. British officials have rejected the proposal, which means—oh yes—Donald J. Trump might soon get a meeting with Her Majesty the Queen.
About that tax return
Long after Trump won the election, Democrats are still trying to force him to release his tax returns. The latest attempt involved a little-known law and efforts to frame it as a national security issue, but that was quickly blocked by House Republicans. Maybe that audit will be done come re-election time.
Declined transaction
The U.S. ethics office said Kellyanne Conway made a “clear violation” when she urged Fox & Friends viewers to go online and shop for Ivanka Trump's fashion label. The office's director urged the White House to consider disciplinary actions. Trump disciplining Conway for supporting Ivanka? Good luck with that.
Down the drain
After a decade of legal battles to get his own name trademarked in China—as products from pacemakers to condoms without any affiliation to Trump get produced and sold in the country—Trump appeared in line for a huge victory on Tuesday. The losers? Anyone who dreams of flushing Trump-branded condoms down a Trump-branded toilet, with none of their profits going to the president. (Editor's note: condoms should not be flushed down toilets, as they can cause serious damage to your septic tank.)
Presidency, Senate face-off deepens over stolen mace
The festering crisis of confidence between the Presidency and the National Assembly may have deepened.
There were signs yesterday that the Senate may have resolved to dump all Executive communications sent to it for action.
The resolution to “keep all Executive communications in view” was one of the high points of about three hours closed session the upper chamber held yesterday.
The April 18 invasion of the Senate chamber by thugs was said to have dominated discussions at the closed session.
It was gathered that Senator Abdullahi Adamu (Nasarawa West) was confronted by his colleagues over his alleged role in the invasion of the Senate chamber.
Sources said that Adamu was pointedly called an “enemy of democracy” when he allegedly insinuated that “there is no smoke without fire”.
It was gathered that most senators at the secret meeting insisted that “the sustained persecution of the Senate by the Executive must stop”.
The senators, it was gathered, decided that “they must defend themselves as well as democracy.”
It was learnt that the lawmakers also vowed that “whatever comes from the executive will not be considered as long as the persecution continues”.
Asked what specifically the Senate decided to dump, the sources refused to go into details but noted that “the decision was near unanimous”.
One said: “It was obvious that most senators were not comfortable with the sustained onslaught against the National Assembly, particularly against the Senate.”
He said that most senators agreed that the alleged attacks were being “orchestrated and sustained by the Presidency”.
According to the source, discussion of the invasion of the Senate chamber by thugs and the role allegedly played by some senators generated a lot of heat in the chamber.
He said that senators agreed that the invasion was “too daring” to be considered as ordinary.
He said that although the mace, the symbol of authority of the Senate, had been recovered by the police, “many of our colleagues insisted that the matter must not be swept under the carpet”.
Senator Kabiru Marafa (Zamfara Central) was said to have accused some senators of “steadily causing division in the Senate”.
He was also said to have claimed that “many of those promoting the division in the Senate were not originally with President Muhammadu Buhari”.
Marafa was said to have insisted that whereas he and some other senators followed the party's line at the beginning of the 8th Senate, others who backed Senate President Abubakar Bukola Saraki defied party directives to install Saraki.
The Zamfara senator, the source said, was categorical that some senators were promoting, and sponsoring seeds of discord in the Senate.
He was also said to have insisted that the actions of some senators partly led to the April 18 invasion.
It was gathered that shortly after Marafa spoke, the former Nasarawa State governor, Adamu, took the floor to caution senators to be wary of the discussion of the invasion.
Adamu was also said to have cautioned against the insinuation that Senator Ovie Omo-Agege was linked to the incident.
The source noted that “the outburst of Adamu to the effect that there is no smoke without fire” infuriated many senators.
He said that Adamu drew the ire of other senators when he insisted: “There is no smoke without fire, and I tell you there is big fire behind this smoke.”
The source said Marafa particularly and some other descended on Adamu, calling him names, including “a threat to democracy”.
He said that the session almost became rowdy when many senators rose in anger to attack Adamu.
He said that Adamu was accused of failing to play the role of a statesman even though his age and experience in government showed him as one.
Adamu was also accused of being “a threat to democracy and sustainable peace in the chamber”.
After the closed session, the Senate at plenary announced at a short session that a joint committee with the House of Representatives would probe the incident.
Saraki, who announced this, said: “This legislature is a true representation of democracy and as long as we defend this legislature, we defend democracy in this country,
“We also resolved the need to tighten the security at the National Assembly and I'm calling on all members of the public to please cooperate with us.
“Clearly, there are some loopholes here and we need to tighten them.
“A constitution of a joint committee of the Senate and the House of Representatives also resolved to investigate the incident of the 18th of April, to look at the factors leading to it and to ensure that such never happens again at the National Assembly.
“We also directed our committee on Security, Intelligence and Police to engage with the Director of the Department of State Services (DSS) and the Inspector General of Police to look at how to strengthen the security of the National Assembly to ensure that these security lapses will not reoccur.”

DETROIT — Two-time Olympic boxing champion Claressa Shields is looking to take over another division.
The 23-year-old super middleweight champion is scheduled to take on Hanna Gabriels for vacant middleweight title on June 22 at Masonic Temple in Detroit.
Shields, who is from Flint, Michigan, is training with John David Jackson for the first time. She has won all five of her fights, including two by knockouts.
The 35-year-old Gabriels, who is from Costa Rica, is a super welterweight champion. She is 18-1 with 11 knockouts.
WASHINGTON – A timeline of key dates leading to the resignation of White House National Security Adviser Michael Flynn:
Nov. 17: President-elect Donald Trump offers former military intelligence chief Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser.
Dec. 25: According to incoming Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Flynn sends a text to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak “wishing him a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year” and saying he looks forward “to touching base with you and working with you, and I wish you all the best.” Spicer says the ambassador texted Flynn back, “wishing him a Merry Christmas as well.”
Dec. 29: The United States retaliates against Russian hacking aimed at influencing the U.S. election. President Barack Obama announces sanctions Russian intelligence services and their top officials, kicking out 35 Russian officials and closing down two Russian-owned compounds in the U.S. Flynn texts the ambassador and the two speak by phone. Spicer later says the call was “centered around the logistics of setting up a call” between Trump and President Vladimir Putin.
Dec. 30: Putin announces he won't immediately retaliate against Obama's sanctions, breaking from a pattern of angry denunciations of U.S. penalties. The Russian leader says he plans to restore U.S. ties “based on the policies that will be carried out by the administration of President D. Trump.” Trump later praises Putin's restraint on Twitter. “Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!” he writes.
Jan. 13: Asenior U.S. official tells The Associated Press that the Obama administration is aware of contacts between Flynn and Kislyak, including one on Dec. 29. Spicer denies the timing of the call, then later acknowledges it. Spicer says Flynn and Kislyak did not discuss sanctions. They only discussed logistics, he said, “that was it, plain and simple.”
Jan. 15: Vice President Mike Pence repeats that denial in an interview with CBS's “Face the Nation.” Flynn and Kislyak “did not discuss anything having to do with the United States' decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia” in their conversations, he says.
Jan. 23: Spicer says in his first scheduled press conference that he'd spoken with Flynn the night before and was assured that the sanctions were not a topic that was discussed in Flynn's calls with Kislyak.
Jan. 26: The Justice Department informs White House Counsel Don McGahn that the White House denials contradict what intelligence officials knew to be true based on routine recordings of communications with foreign officials who are in the U.S. The White House says Trump and other senior advisers were “immediately” informed of the issue. Trump's tasks the White House counsel's office to begin looking into the legal issues involved, Spicer said.
Jan. 28: Flynn is photographed sitting in the Oval Office as the president speaks with Putin by phone.
Feb. 1: Flynn continues to serve in full capacity. He makes a surprise appearance at a daily White House briefing and delivers a message to Iran. “As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice,” he says.
Feb. 8: Flynn again denies that he'd discussed sanctions with Kislyak, according to The Washington Post.
Feb. 9: Flynn, through his spokesman, backs away from his comments, according to the Post. A spokesman for Flynn tells the paper “that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn't be certain that the topic never came up.” Citing U.S. officials, the Post publishes a report stating that Flynn did discuss U.S. sanctions against Russia with Kislyak during the month Trump took office, despite administration officials' denials. The report also suggests Flynn had misled Pence.
Feb. 10: Trump is asked about the Post report. “I haven't seen them. I'll look into them,” he says. Flynn meets with Pence and speaks with him by phone.
Feb. 13: Flynn delivers the president's daily briefing, sits in on his calls with foreign leaders and joins his meetings with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Around 5 p.m., White House adviser Kellyanne Conway tells reporters that the president has “full confidence” in Flynn. Less than an hour later, Spicer tells reporters that the president is “evaluating the situation.” Shortly after, the Post breaks the news of the earlier Justice Department warning. Flynn submits his resignation. Keith Kellogg is named acting national security adviser. Flynn is spotted waking down the hallway that leads from the Oval Office to his office just after 10 p.m.
Mr Trump's call for an investigation into the media comes after Senate Intelligence committee says Russia collusion issue 'is still open': AFP/Getty
Donald Trump has urged the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is currently investigating him over alleged ties to Russia during the 2016 election, to launch a new probe into the "fake news" media.
It comes after the committee's chairman Richard Burr said the investigation "has more work to do" to determine whether there was collusion between Russian officials and members of Mr Trump's election team.
Writing on Twitter, Mr Trump made the call for an investigation into “fake news networks” 24 hours after naming US news organisations NBC and CNN as “dishonest”.
“NBC news is #FakeNews and more dishonest than even CNN,” Mr Trump wrote. “They are a disgrace to good reporting. No wonder their news ratings are way down!”
On Wednesday NBC reported that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called the President a “moron” at a Pentagon meeting in July, citing several senior Whitehouse officials.
This week the news outlet reported Mr Tillerson was “on the verge of resigning” over the summer, citing “senior administration officials”.
Mr Tillerson rapidly issued a statement to reporters that said: “I have never considered leaving this post.”
However, he did not issue an outright denial of having described Mr Trump as a “moron”, saying, “I'm not going to deal with petty stuff like that.”
Mr Trump's call for an inquiry also comes one day after after Mr Burr said the Senate Intelligence Committee is still examining whether Russia colluded with Trump campaign advisers in efforts to influence the 2016 election.
“The collusion issue is still open”, Mr Burr said, adding the panel had confirmed the findings of US intelligence agencies which had found Russia did interfere in the election.
Mr Trump's call for the committee, which is responsible for overseeing the intelligence agencies and bureaus of the US government, to examine news reporting in the US is the latest indication of his frustration with the media's coverage of his administration.
Eight of 19 of the President's tweets and retweets in the last 48-hours have referenced “fake news” or the media.

WHITECOURT, Alta. — A man in Alberta is dead after a confrontation with the RCMP in which shots were fired.
Mounties say an officer tried to stop a vehicle on Tuesday along Highway 43 in the Whitecourt region, about 180 kilometres northwest of Edmonton.
They say a confrontation followed, officers opened fire and the suspect was later found dead.
It's not yet clear why police were seeking the man.
Around 5:15 p.m., the RCMP said traffic tie-ups on the highway following the incident had been cleared.

Lyft's Ridership Skyrockets While Uber Keeps Losing
Ride-hailing service Lyft carried more passengers through June this year than it did in all of last year as it capitalized on missteps by Uber.
Ridership through June surpassed the record 162.5 million rides it gave in all of 2016, Lyft said Monday. A spokeswoman wouldn't give an exact number.
The company has made its gains as some people avoid Lyft's much larger rival, Uber. Both companies are based in San Francisco.
Uber has been without a CEO since June when company co-founder Travis Kalanick stepped down under pressure from the board. The departure took place after investigations by outside law firms uncovered widespread sexual harassment at the company. Kalanick also was captured on video in a profanity-laced tirade toward an Uber driver, and the company is under federal investigation for allegedly using software to thwart city inspectors who were trying to monitor its drivers.
And finding a replacement for Kalanick has not gone smoothly. The reported front-runner, Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman announced on Thursday that she would not take the job. Media reports say some board members are now talking to outgoing General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt. The New York Times reported Monday that Kalanick may attempt to regain an operational role in the company he helped to create.
Lyft wouldn't comment on Uber but says it added 160 U.S. cities this year. The company operates only in the U.S.
Uber says it's given more than 5 billion rides worldwide since 2010.
Lyft confirmed its 2017 ridership numbers for the first time Monday while announcing the appointment of a new board member. Former Obama administration senior adviser Valerie Jarrett is the board's 10th member. She was assistant to the president for public engagement and intergovernmental affairs for his entire term, according to Lyft.

See smuggling as crime, give credible intel to help us succeed- Customs
The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has urged Nigerians to see smuggling as a crime and support it to succeed in the war against smugglers.
Mr Joseph Attah, Public Relations Officer of the Service, made the speech on Monday in Abuja.
He said that the service anti-smuggling strategy was yielding positive dividend, adding that in the past three months, the service had seized 136,506 bags of rice.
“All Nigerians should see smuggling as a crime so that they will support the service to succeed in our ongoing war against smugglers.
“Seeing smuggling as a crime means that you will be willing to give creditable information that will help us succeed.
“As villagers that live around borderline, they should be willing to support customs officers whenever they make seizures and they are encountering some difficulties, rather than supporting the smugglers against customs
” In Nigeria when a thief is arrested or an armed robber is arrested, you hardly get to see people going to beg for them.
“But today when a smuggler is arrested you see Nigerians, including some respected ones in our society, coming to beg for such persons to be released because they don't see smuggling as a crime; they see it as a trade,'' Attah said.
He said that some Nigerians often times accused the NCS of not doing enough in its service delivery.
He said it was wrong for people to think that a smuggler could only be successful when supported in active connivance by customs officers.
According to him, smugglers now take advantage of the porous borders, adding that oftentimes they are supported by villagers at the borderline and unpatronic well to do individuals in carryiny out their smuggling activities.
” NCS cannot 100 per cent vouch for its officers like any other human organisation; it is totally wrong to suggest that every criminal activity must be with the connivance of an operative,” he added.
Attah said that the service would remain focused on its statutory function of enforcing government polices rather than being distracted by the blame game
” In our continuous efforts to suppress smuggling, information, suggestions that can help the service to perform better are welcome from well meaning individuals or organisation.”

Cardi B made history this week as “I Like It,” her collaboration with Bad Bunny and J Balvin reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. This makes her the first female rapper with two No. 1's, Billboard reports. Cardi B's first No. 1 occurred in October when “Bodak Yellow” reigned supreme on the Hot 100 for three weeks, ousting Taylor Swift's “Look What You Made Me Do” in the process. “I Like It” is Bad Bunny and J Balvin's first No. 1.
According to @chartdata, Cardi B's debut album, Invasion of Privacy, is time a female artist's album produced multiple No. 1 singles since Taylor Swift's 1989. The Bronx rapper is in elite company as she joins the four other female rappers to crack No. 1: Lauryn Hill for “Doo Wop (That Thing), Lil Kim with “Lady Marmalade,” Shawnna with Ludacris for “Stand Up,” and Iggy Azealia for “Fancy.”

Angel di Maria scored twice as Paris St-Germain stunned Barcelona to leave the Spanish side in danger of failing to reach the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time in a decade.
PSG dominated this last-16 first-leg tie throughout and took the lead through Di Maria's curled free-kick.
Julian Draxler added a second with an angled drive before Di Maria curled an effort into the top corner.
Edinson Cavani then sealed a famous win with a powerful fourth.
A lacklustre Barcelona – with Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar largely anonymous – did not produce an effort of note until seven minutes before the end when Samuel Umtiti headed on to the post.
The defeat leaves Luis Enrique's side with an almighty task to stay in the competition when they host PSG in the return leg on 8 March.
No side has managed to overturn a four-goal first-leg deficit in the Champions League.
Barcelona breezed into the knockout stage by topping Group C, winning five of the six games they played.
Their one defeat was also the only time they conceded three goals in a group-stage game, when they lost 3-1 at Manchester City.
At least in that match they managed to score – Messi putting them ahead at Etihad Stadium – but at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday they barely troubled Kevin Trapp in the PSG goal.
The visitors regularly squandered possession and looked lethargic throughout. When they have not been at their best in the past, their star players have stepped up. But on this occasion they offered nothing.
Messi, so often capable of creating something from nothing, made uncharacteristic mistakes and was at fault for PSG's second when he lost the ball to Draxler, who then played a one-two with Marco Verratti to slice through a static defence and put the French side in control.
It was one of the worst Barcelona performances in recent memory but PSG were also at their absolute best and, in truth, could have won by an even bigger margin.
They finished the game with 16 shots on goal, 10 of those on target.
PSG have long been the dominant force in French football, winning their domestic league title every season since 2013, but they are yet to transfer that form into Europe.
They have never progressed beyond the quarter-finals but dominant wins home and away against Chelsea at this stage of the competition last year suggested they had finally joined the continent's elite, only for them to then lose against Manchester City.
Unai Emery, PSG's Spanish manager, had faced Barcelona 23 times before in his coaching career and won just once.
But Emery has form in Europe. He led Sevilla to three successive Europa Leagues titles from 2014, getting the best of the players at his disposal and that is proving to be the case at PSG.
Cavani now has 34 goals in 32 matches while Di Maria is producing consistently what he only managed in flashes at Manchester United. Draxler, who underperformed at Wolfsburg, has excelled since his January move to the French capital.
All three were key to Barcelona's downfall and this could prove to be a watershed moment for both PSG and Emery.
“I think this makes PSG a threat in the competition,” former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand told BT Sport.
“Mentally they will go on again and they will believe now they are capable of winning this tournament by beating one of the best teams.”
Home form hope for Barcelona
Barcelona were one of the favourites to win the Champions League at the start of the season but will now need to produce one of the greatest comebacks in football to stay in the competition.
They are more than capable of scoring goals for fun at the Nou Camp, having hit three or more in six of their previous seven games.
Borussia Monchengladbach were the last side to visit Barcelona in the Champions League and they lost 4-0 in December.
But PSG possess much more quality, with Di Maria and Cavani more than capable of scoring an away goal that would surely put the tie beyond Barcelona.
It is sure to be one of the toughest tests of Enrique's Barcelona career to date.
Barça's joint-heaviest defeat – the stats
Welterweight champion Keith Thurman is relinquishing his WBC title.
Thurman, who also owns the WBA belt, said Tuesday he would step aside while rehabilitating from elbow surgery and a recent hand injury. That should lead to Danny Garcia and Shawn Porter fighting for the championship.
Garcia and Porter have lost to Thurman. WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman said Thurman will be a mandated opponent for the organization's champion once he heals.
The 29-year-old Thurman (28-0, 22 knockouts) has been plagued by a string of injuries the last two years. He injured his neck in an auto accident in February 2016, four months before beating Porter.
He defeated Garcia by split decision in a welterweight unification match on March 4, 2017. A month later he had major surgery on his right elbow to remove bone spurs and calcium deposits.
In training last month, Thurman damaged his hand.
Goodale had to delay some events on Monday but Tuesday's final day of talks unfolded largely as planned. A major focus was addressing violent extremism and preventing the internet from being as a tool for training, propaganda and financing.
"It's the insidiousness of the messaging on the web," Goodale said in an interview prior to the talks.
"That's something that all ministers worry about."
Goodale and his fellow G7 leaders called on major internet service providers that are also at this meeting — Google, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft — to do more to prevent their platforms from being exploited.
Goodale said the service providers realize the need to co-operate, and were to discuss options with the G7 ministers. He said they will be urging service providers "to be quick and proficient and quick and persistent in making sure their various services are not any kind of platform for terrorist material or terrorist activity."
"You do not want your platform to be known as a safe harbour for terror or sexual exploitation or human trafficking or political interference."
The internet giants addressed the G7 ministers last fall in Italy, when it held the presidency, and Krings said it was necessary to hear from them again.
In Germany, the government has taken a hard line against internet providers and what they can disseminate and has a network enforcement law that it is not popular in some quarters, he said.
"Certainly, the companies didn't like it so much. But it's also clear that the standards of what can be communicated on the internet can't be set by the terms and conditions of private contracts," he said.
"These standards have to be set by democratically elected lawmakers, who decide on what is libel, what is defamation and how far can you go in even an open society."
In Tuesday's opening remarks, Goodale said cybertechnology has become "a disruptive force" with the potential to harm critical infrastructure "and the power to more easily conceal identities."
In the interview, Goodale offered some insight into the closed-door discussion he planned to lead with his counterparts.
"You're looking for the holes. When you're dealing with this technology and you get into the deep, dark web, how much of it is encrypted, how much of it is inaccessible, how much of it is beyond technical capacity to crack into?"

After being missing for more than three decades, the famed "Woman Ocre" painting by Willem De Koonig was discovered in Silver Springs, New Mexico after it was purchased at an auction. ABC's Ron Claiborne reports.
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Marvel Studios has built a movie empire that has not only proved crowd-pleasing, but has also racked up box-office profits to the tune of nearly $15 billion in the 10 years since "Iron Man" was released.
The 2008 film starring Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man proved that superheroes not named Spider-Man, Superman and Batman could find massive audiences. "Avengers: Infinity War," the 19th film in the Marvel Studios universe arrives Friday, and may break box-office records in its opening weekend. The third Avengers film assembles characters and story lines developed over the years, including Captain America, Thor, the Guardians of the Galaxy and this year's sensation, the Black Panther.

These measurement expeditions have typically excluded experts from Nepal, which shares the mountain with China and is one of the poorest countries in Asia.
Now, for the first time, Nepali surveyors are limiting intervention from foreign powers and sending a team to the summit to settle the height question for themselves. In addition to the science, a bit of national pride is at stake.
“Mount Everest is our treasure,” said Buddhi Narayan Shrestha, the former director general of Nepal's Department of Survey. “What will happen if foreign experts continue to reduce the height of our mountain without us participating?”
The first recorded attempt to measure Everest's height came in the mid-19th century, when Nepal was a Hindu monarchy, closed to outsiders.

A team hired by Sir George Everest, a former surveyor general of India, assembled near India's border with Nepal. It was there that Radhanath Sikdar, a young Indian mathematician, and a group of so-called human computers, used triangulation to collect data on the mountain, known then as Peak XV.
Folklore has it that when Mr. Sikdar finished calculating his findings in 1852, he made a beeline for the office of a superior stationed in the foothills of the Himalayas and announced that he had “discovered the highest mountain in the world.”
In 1856, the height of Peak XV was recorded at 29,002 feet, a number remarkably close to the height recognized by climbing bodies today. But Mr. Sikdar's contributions were pushed to the footnotes, and Peak XV was eventually renamed in honor of Mr. Everest.

About 100 years later, when Nepal cracked open its borders to foreigners, scientists moved their measurement tools closer to the mountain, which lies partly in Tibet. In the mid-1950s, the height was recognized as about 29,029 feet, making it the world's tallest mountain above sea level.
(By one measure, the world's highest peak is actually Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador. The summit of Chimborazo, an inactive volcano in the Andes, rises about 20,500 feet above sea level, far short of Everest. But because of the globe's bulge at the Equator, it's a different story when you measure from the center of Earth: Chimborazo's apex then rises the farthest, at about 21 million feet or 3,967 miles.)
Government officials in Nepal have been selective about recognizing data generated by other countries, with some measurements less welcome than others.

Take the case of China, which shares the summit with Nepal. After Chinese surveyors assessed Everest's summit in 2005, measuring the height both from the peak's rock base and from the top of the snowfall, a heated dispute over the height ensued.
Ang Tshering Sherpa, the former head of the Nepal Mountaineering Association, said China applied pressure on the Nepal's government and an international climbing body to recognize 29,017 feet, the measurement from the rock base, as the mountain's new height.
But Nepal held its ground, and China recently backed down, Mr. Sherpa said, apparently in response to a drop in climbers tackling the mountain from the Tibet side.

Having those few extra feet recognized on summit certificates was enough for some mountaineers to switch routes, opting to climb from, and spend money in, Nepal.
“China changed its own findings last year after the number of climbers summiting Mount Everest from the northern side significantly decreased,” Mr. Sherpa said.
A proposal from India to jointly measure the mountain with Nepal was passed over. Last year, Swarna Subba Rao, then the surveyor general of India, allocated resources to send a 30-member team of mountaineers to gather data from the summit. Nepal, which has had frosty relations with India in the past, “humbly declined” the proposal.

“We are capable of the job,” said Ganesh Prasad Bhatta, the director general of Nepal's Department of Survey, which is overseeing Nepal's measurement project.
Roger Bilham, a geologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, said Everest's location in the zone of compression between southern Tibet and India means it sinks during earthquakes and rises in the period between them. A major earthquake in 1934 lowered the mountain by 63 centimeters, or about two feet, according to data provided by Mr. Bilham.
In the 19th century, the height of Everest was calculated by measuring the angles between the top of the mountain and points on the ground whose positions relative to the average height of the sea were already known.
Now, surveyors place a global positioning system receiver on the summit ice for an hour, and mathematically calculate the height of the sea from satellites and measurements of gravity at the base.
To prepare for the country's own expedition, Nepali surveyors will collect measurements this month along the country's southern plains, where they plan to calculate sea level. A team of Sherpas are also being trained to bring a GPS receiver to the summit. The cost to measure the mountain is estimated at $250,000.
Alan Arnette, a well-known mountaineer, said any measurement of the summit is still “a snapshot in time,” with different levels of ice accumulation causing variations in the height. He questioned whether the expedition was worth what it would cost Nepal.
“As a mountaineer, I would like to see the results,” Mr. Arnette said, “but as someone who supports the Nepal people, the money could be spent on jobs, food, clean air and other programs more important to the health of the nation.”
Transcript for Will Trump fire Mueller?
So, is it last call for Mueller time? Trump spent the weekend attacking Robert Mueller on Twitter, and his lawyers want an end to the Russia investigation, but his golf buddy, Lindsey graham, thinks it's a bad idea. Watch. Are you worried that the president is preparing fo order the firing of Mueller? It sure looks that way from his tweets. Well, as I said before, if he tried to do that, that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency because we're a rule of law nation. When it comes to Mr. Mueller, he is following the evidence where it takes him, and I think it's very important he is allowed to do his job without interference. There are many Republicans who share my view. So who are these other Republicans? Paul Ryan said through his spokesperson that Mueller should be able to do his job. That's what he said. And Mitch Mcconnell has said zip. So why won't they just step in and way -- really say -- as a matter of fact Mcconnell said we don't need a law to protect Mueller. Trey goudwdy said that does him a disservice. He said firing Mueller would be cataclysm cataclysmic, I think Lindsey graham in particular because he's a hard person to pin down. Some days he's golfing with trump, some days he's a critic of the administration. If you're innocent, that's the thing that trey Gowdy -- I also liked that quote. He said if you've done nothing wrong you should want the investigation to be as fulsome as possible. At the end of this I'm going to come out looking good. The more he tries to shut it down, the more I'm intrigued. It's very disingenuous for them to say if you have nothing to hide. He has plenty to hide. I remember there were people that we would investigate and they'd say come into my office, take all my computer files. They wanted the investigation to be as robust as possible. As a prosecutor you start to think, well, maybe they don't have anything to hide if they're being so transparent. But when you have someone who is at every turn trying to obstruct justice and you're investigating him for obstructing justice, it raises a lot of red flags. I know, I know. Graham is a notorious flip-flopper. I like him but he flip-flops. I don't know if I can believe him. We were talking about it in the meeting today. He was the one that said you shouldn't be able to fire the special counsel. He co-sponsored this bill to prevent the president from firing -- Where is Mitch Mcconnell and Paul Ryan? They're the leaders of the party. They say nothing, really. Honestly, I don't think it's logical that Mueller is going to get fired. I don't think it's in the realm of possibility. I think on both sides there would be absolute bedlam in the street if it happened. Really? Yes. Constitutional crises for sure. I think it would be absolute chaos. So I don't see -- I think you can tweet a lot of things and say a lot of things but if it happens, I mean, we would probably come into this show drinking, quite frankly. We've already seen that in history with Nixon, right? But the Republicans were different. They actually cared more than these Republicans. For god's sake, trey Gowdy, Lindsey graham, I'm here telling you -- It's only Monday. Let's work into this. It was because of the Republican party back in the day of watergate that Nixon had to resign. I wonder if that will happen. It's so obvious that the Russians have hacked into this election. They control our national grid. When is trump and the rest of them going to -- when they stop not being able to watch Fox News, is that when it's going to happen that the lights go out? If they can do that they can tap into our nuclear facilities. I mean, we're in trouble in this country and everybody seems to be la, la, la. I don't think it's la, la, la. There are studies that more people are going to therapists and on medication. I don't think anybody is like la, la, la.

Three men have been arrested since May of last year on charges of plotting attacks in New York City for the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isil) during the summer of 2016, US prosecutors said on Friday.
The planned attacks, which were thwarted by law enforcement, included detonating explosives in Manhattan's Times Square and in the city's subway, according to the office of acting US Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan.
One of the men, 19-year-old Canadian citizen Abdulrahman El Bahnasawy, has been in US custody since May 2016, when he was arrested in New Jersey. He pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in October 2016, the prosecutors said.
Talha Haroon, a 19-year-old U.S. citizen, was arrested in Pakistan, where he lives, around September 2016, and Russell Salic, a 37-year-old citizen of the Philippines, was arrested in that country in April of this year, according to Mr Kim's office.
Prosecutors said they expected Haroon and Salic to be extradited to the United States to face the charges, which include conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism and to support a terrorist organisation. If convicted of the most serious charges, they face a maximum sentence of life in prison.
Acting Manhattan US Attorney announces unsealing of charges in foiled 2016 NYC terror plot https://t.co/2Lf8aGSWA3 — US Attorney SDNY (@SDNYnews) October 6, 2017
Lawyers for the three men could not immediately be identified.
Prosecutors said El Bahnasawy bought bomb-making materials and helped secure a cabin near New York City from which to stage attacks. They said Haroon planned to travel from Pakistan to help El Bahnasawy carry out attacks, and that Salic helped fund the plot.
According to documents unsealed in federal court in Manhattan on Friday, El Bahnasawy and Haroon planned to carry out attacks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which ran from early June to early July.
El Bahnasawy told an undercover law enforcement officer posing as a supporter of Isil that he wanted to "create the next 9/11," prosecutors said. El Bahnasawy told the officer of plans to detonate a car bomb in Times Square and "shoot up concerts," according to prosecutors.

Haroon likewise told the officer that Times Square was "a perfect spot to hit them," prosecutors said.
Salic, who maintained a pro-Islamic State social media presence, told the undercover officer that he had been communicating with El Bahnasawy, and sent the officer about $423 from the Philippines to help pay for the attacks, according to prosecutors.
El Bahnasawy bought bomb-making materials in Canada, and was arrested the same day he came to the United States, the prosecutors said

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Republicans' ardor for investigations and oversight, on display throughout the Obama administration, has cooled off considerably with Donald Trump in the White House.
Each day seems to bring a new headache or near-crisis from Trump, the latest being the departure of his national security adviser under questionable circumstances involving Russia.
Yet if there is a line too far, at which point Republicans will feel duty-bound to call for an independent investigation of their president or his administration, Trump hasn't crossed it yet.
Democrats are clamoring for a full-scale probe of the resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, including demanding to know what Trump knew, and when, about Flynn's pre-inauguration conversations with a Russian ambassador about U.S. sanctions. White House press secretary Sean Spicer disclosed that Trump was told in late January that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about those conversations.
Rather than go along with Democrats' call for an independent outside investigation, Senate Republicans insisted Tuesday that the Intelligence Committee could look at the circumstances as part of an existing probe into Russia's interference in the presidential election.
"The Intelligence Committee is already looking at Russian involvement in our election and they have broad jurisdiction over the intel community writ large and they can look at whatever they choose to," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., adding that "it's highly likely they'd want to take a look at this episode as well."
The intelligence panel's chairman, Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, told reporters that "aggressive" oversight would continue "privately. We don't do that in public."
House Republicans were even less interested, with some shrugging off Democrats' calls for an investigation entirely. Rep. Devin Nunes of California, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that the "real crime" is how Flynn's phone conversations were leaked, echoing a complaint Trump himself made over Twitter.
"I think the situation has taken care of itself" in light of Flynn's resignation, House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, told reporters. That's a far different stance toward potential wrongdoing by the executive branch than Chaffetz took last year, when House Republicans issued more than 70 letters and subpoenas aimed at investigating Democrat Hillary Clinton over a period of less than three months after the FBI announced criminal charges weren't warranted related to her use of a private email server as secretary of state.
Chaffetz did turn his attention to a different Trump administration matter later Tuesday, sending a letter to the White House seeking information about Trump's discussion of a North Korea missile launch while dining al fresco with the Japanese prime minister at a resort in Florida.
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., went so far as to counsel publicly against spending too much time investigating the White House, saying that doing so could only be counterproductive at a moment when the GOP faces a daunting legislative agenda on Capitol Hill.
"I just don't think it's useful to be doing investigation after investigation, particularly of your own party," Paul said in an appearance on Fox News Radio's "Kilmeade and Friends." ''We'll never even get started with doing the things we need to do like repealing Obamacare if we're spending our whole time having Republicans investigate Republicans. I think it makes no sense."
The relatively hands-off stance of the GOP toward the Trump White House angers Democrats, who are powerless to do much except fume from the minority in both chambers of Congress.
"Do you hear the silence? This is the sound of House Republicans conducting no oversight of President Trump. Zero," Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, complained at a news conference Tuesday. "That is what it sounds like when they abdicate their duty under the Constitution. We've been asking for months for basic oversight."
The GOP's lack of enthusiasm about investigating the Trump White House comes as Capitol Hill Republicans struggle to come to terms with a new administration that has been engulfed in upheaval after upheaval. Republicans are trying to focus on their agenda despite the distractions. And for now, they appear to have concluded, going easy on Trump is the best way to achieve their goals, including confirming a Supreme Court justice and passing a new health care law and other legislation they want the president to sign.
"We know full well that there are issues that are going to come up on a daily basis that we're going to get asked about and have to respond to," said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 Senate Republican, "but we're interested in repealing and replacing Obamacare, reforming the tax code, reducing the regulatory burden on businesses, confirming a Supreme Court justice, getting these Cabinet nominees through — that's what our agenda is right now."

WINNIPEG — Police in Winnipeg say they were already considering a potential vehicle attack as they planned security for Jets fans looking to party downtown during the NHL playoffs.
Insp. Dave Dalal says attacks such as the one in Toronto on Monday are becoming more common, and Winnipeg police are prepared to keep fans at the so-called Whiteout street parties safe.
Police have said there were 36,000 people downtown when the Jets clinched a first-round victory against the Minnesota Wild.
Dalal, who is special events commander, says large trucks parked at the four street entrances to the party are there to keep crowds safe.
So is the increased police presence at the party site near the MTS Centre where the Jets play.
Dalal says police are ready for when the Jets take on the Nashville Predators in the second round of the playoffs.
“We've been mindful of this type of threat and that's why you've seen the large vehicles parked there,” Dalal said Tuesday. “We've seen these threats worldwide. The reason that they're so prolific is that they're hard to prevent and they're easy to carry out.
“Our intent is to make sure that everybody who's down celebrating has a safe environment to do so. Part of that is ensuring there are no vehicles that will either deliberately or inadvertently get through.”
There are also security measures in place to protect fans walking to the Whiteout parties, Dalal said, but he wouldn't comment on specific operational tactics.
“People will see street closures to prevent vehicles from accessing the area. You'll see officers at various points leading into the area as a visible presence,” he said.
“Nobody thought it would happen in Toronto … We're doing our best to make sure that doesn't happen here.”
Security will increase as projected crowd numbers grow larger, Dalal added.

"How do you reconcile public safety and the First Amendment?" That's the question Charlottesville, Va., Mayor Mike Signer asked in an interview on Sunday.
And it's a question city and state governments are likely grappling with after the weekend's violence in Charlottesville.
Around the country, white nationalists and other groups have protested efforts to remove statues and other symbols of the Confederacy. As counter-demonstrators arrive to protest the white nationalists, the resulting scenes are often tense and brimming with the potential for violence.
State and local officials prepared for Saturday's protests in Charlottesville, which were known about for months. But in the wake of fierce brawling in the streets of the usually quiet college town, and then a driver plowing his car into a crowd of pedestrians, killing one and injuring 19, many are asking what Charlottesville authorities could have done differently—and what could be done to prevent such violence in the future.
City Permitting and Free Speech
Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe told NPR's Morning Edition that local authorities had done what they could to head off the fighting that erupted, but that they were foiled by a federal judge's decision to allow the Unite The Right rally to go on in Charlottesville's Emancipation Park.
Charlottesville tried to revoke the permit it had issued for the rally to be held in Emancipation Park, in order to move the protestors about a mile away to McIntire Park, which offered more open space.
"That was the place it should have been. We were unfortunately sued by the ACLU and the judge ruled against us," McAuliffe said. "That rally should not have been in the middle of downtown ... where [people] dispersed all over the city streets, and it became a powder keg. We've got to look at these permits, and we've got to look at where we put these rallies and protesters."
The ACLU responded that the injunction was the city's fault because it mounted a weak legal case.
"The Governor's anger about what happened is understandable," ACLU Virginia Executive Director Claire Guthrie Hastings said in a statement to NPR. "We are angry, too. The situation that occurred was preventable, and our lawsuit challenging the City to act constitutionally did not cause it. ... All we did was ask the City to live up to the requirements of the Constitution. That it failed to do so is on the City, not us."
Charlottesville Police Tactics Scrutinized
Also under scrutiny was the action – or inaction – of the Charlottesville police.
McAuliffe told Morning Edition that the police did "a magnificent job," and said the potential for violence had been high.
"They had to be very careful," the governor said. "We had been planning for this for a while. We had to show tremendous restraint because ... these people all came armed. I've never seen so many weapons. These people were wearing better gear than my own state police were wearing. They had body armor, helmets. I mean people were walking around with semi-automatic rifles through the streets."
"[If] one person fired one shot, it would have been a melee, and I would be talking to you today with a lot of body bags. None of that happened."
"Think of this," McAuliffe said. "Not one window was shattered, not one ounce of property damage, not one shot fired, and not one person went to the hospital, except for the 19 who were hit by a car terrorist. Which, you can't, you know – there's no preparation's that's gonna prepare for some nut, some murderer, who's going to turn his car into a weapon and run through a crowd."
But both protesters and counter-protesters criticized the police response.
"There was no police presence," Brittany Caine-Conley, a minister in training who locked arms with other clergy members in counter-protest, told The New York Times. "We were watching people punch each other; people were bleeding all the while police were inside of barricades at the park, watching. It was essentially just brawling on the street and community members trying to protect each other."
Princeton professor and activist Cornel West, who was also at the protest, told The Washington Post "the police didn't do anything in terms of protecting the people of the community, the clergy."
To Unite The Right rally's organizer, Jason Kessler, was also critical. "Charlottesville refused to honor permit as ordered by a federal judge. CPD didn't even show up until 1.5 hrs into the permit," he tweeted. "Inside the park was peaceful. Outbreaks of violence occurred where police refused to separate or even pushed the feuding groups together."
White nationalist Richard Spencer, another organizer, said the police had failed to protect the people who had gathered for the rally. "We came here as a demonstration of our movement," Spencer told the Post. "And we were effectively thrown to the wolves."
The ACLU's Hastings also criticized the policing on Saturday, which she said "was not designed to be ... effective in preventing violence."
"I was there and brought concerns directly to the Secretary of Public Safety and the head of the State Police," said Hastings. "They did not respond. In fact, law enforcement was standing passively by, waiting for violence to take place, so that they would have grounds to declare an emergency, declare an 'unlawful assembly' and clear the area."
Charles Ramsey, who formerly headed the police in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., told the Post that demonstrators and counter-demonstrators "need to be in sight and sound of each other, but somebody has to be in between .... That's usually the police."
"The whole point is to have overwhelming force so that people don't get the idea they can do these kinds of things and get away with it," he said.
An NPR request for comment from the Charlottesville Police Department was not returned.
Lt. Joseph Hatter, a commander with the Charlottesville police, told the Post that officers tried to create separate areas. "It didn't work, did it?" he admitted. "I think there was a plan to have them separated. They didn't want to be separated."
He told the newspaper that he doesn't know that police waited to react to the violence. "I think we did the best we could under the circumstances."
Public Assembly and Public Space
Questions about how governments manage protests are likely to continue, and to be argued in court.
On Friday, a federal judge granted a temporary injunction, ruling that the city could not revoke the permit it had issued to Kessler to hold the demonstration in Emancipation Park.
In his opinion, Judge Glen Conrad said Kessler was likely to prevail on his claim that Charlottesville's decision to revoke his permit was content-based.
"Kessler's assertion in this regard is supported by the fact that the City solely revoked his permit, but left in place the permits issued to counter-protestors," Conrad wrote. "The disparity in treatment between the two groups with opposing views suggests that the defendants' decision to revoke Kessler's permit was based on the content of his speech rather than other neutral factors that would be equally applicable to Kessler and those protesting against him. This conclusion is bolstered by other evidence, including communications on social media indicating that members of City Council oppose Kessler's political viewpoint."
The judge wrote further that though the city maintained its decision to revoke Kessler's permit was due to the number of people likely to attend his demonstration, "their concerns in this regard are purely speculative." He added, "there is no evidence to support the notion that many thousands of individuals are likely to attend the demonstration."
Following the events in Charlottesville, those worried about potential violence have fresh evidence.
Public protests can become especially complicated when people are carrying guns and dressed in full camouflage, as some did this weekend in Charlottesville.
McAuliffe argues officials need help from the courts if governments are to maintain public safety while allowing people to exercise their First Amendment rights.
"We've got to get a better understanding with these judges to understand our job is to keep our community safe," he said. "The judiciary needs to do a better job of working with us."
And the ACLU's Hastings says that whatever strategies authorities use, they need to be lawful and in keeping with the Constitution: "It is my firm hope and desire that the Governor and other local officials will learn from this past weekend how constitutionally to prevent events like the horror we saw in Charlottesville."

Afghan First Lady Rula Ghani on Tuesday called for the protection of Afghan girls against child marriages.
According to her, forced marriages affect physical health of young girls and robs them of their childhood and future.
“Child marriage is a depressing phenomenon for the young generation of Afghanistan and it is a national responsibility to stop the menace,'' she told audience in an event held in Afghan Media and Information Centre.
The event marked the inauguration of “National Action Plan to Eliminate Early Child Marriage'' by Afghan Ministries of Women Affairs and Information and Culture.
The inauguration was supported by the Embassy of Canada in Afghanistan and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA).
“I urge all Afghan families to avoid child and forced marriages. Your girls face a huge risk when they get married at young age.
“Early marriage robs them of their childhood and future opportunities,'' she added.
The first Lady noted that getting married in an appropriate age reduces girls' risk for physical, sexual, psychological as well as economic abuse.
UNFPA country representative at the event, Bannet Ndyanabangi said a girl, below 18, was capable of rapidly gaining wisdom and knowledge from the people around her.
“She can be one day an inspiring leader, a productive worker, an innovator, a caring parent or take any other role that empowers a society.
“She can shape the future of her society.
“But all of this depend on how we support her today,'' Ndyanabangi said.
According to a statement issued by UNFPA, the plan of action adopts two approaches, it outlines initiatives designed to prevent and end early child marriage.
“It strives to improve the implementation of laws and services which aim to support people at risk of early child marriage,'' it added.
According to UNICEF, girls aged 15 to 19 who experience pregnancy and childbirth are twice as likely to die of related complications as women aged 20 to 24 years.

The Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem had its license renewed for another five years on Wednesday.
The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board voted to renew the casino operator's license for another five years following a public hearing Wednesday morning in Harrisburg.
In April, the board held a public input hearing in Bethlehem's Town Hall where Sands officials made the case for extending their license and community members expressed support for renewal.
What casino sale? Sands license renewal hearing mum on pending deal
The casino first opened its doors in May 2009. Since then, the gaming hall on former Bethlehem Steel Corp. land has generated almost $4 billion in gross revenue from slot machines and table games resulting in the state collecting more than $1.6 billion in gaming taxes. Its license was last renewed in April 2014.
Once again, there was no acknowledgment of the pending casino sale. Parent company Las Vegas Sands Corp. announced March 8 that it plans to sell its smallest property to Wind Creek Hospitality, an affiliate of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama, for $1.3 billion.
Questions instead focused on the Sands' efforts to curb underage access to the gaming floor and how the casino stays competitive in a tightening northeast gaming market.
Sands Bethlehem President Brian Carr said the casino is constantly looking at how to continue attracting guests, especially folks in the greater New York area. Its hotel renovations have been a success, he said.
Sands is asking itself how to turn the Bethlehem casino more into a resort destination and getaway for our guests, Carr said.
When asked if the Sands had plans to add amenities in the near future, Carr said none that he was ready to speak to Wednesday, but noted there are several options being weighed.
The Sands has not filed a change of ownership and control application with the gaming oversight agency.
Wind Creek Hospitality will have to go through an extensive criminal and financial background check. The board will also ensure it can afford the purchase price.
The application will trigger another public hearing before the gaming board, which would eventually vote to approve or reject the sale.
The Sands currently employs more than 2,400 people and has over 3,000 slot machines and 254 table games.

DENVER (AP) — Taylor Swift has won long-awaited vindication after a jury decided that a radio host groped her during a pre-concert photo op four years ago.
After a weeklong trial over dueling lawsuits, jurors determined Monday that fired Denver DJ David Mueller assaulted the pop star by grabbing her backside during a backstage meet-and-greet.
The six-woman, two-man jury also found that Swift's mother and radio liaison were within their rights to contact Mueller's bosses.
Mueller sued the Swifts and their radio handler, Frank Bell, seeking up to $3 million for his ruined career.
Just before closing arguments, the judge dismissed Taylor Swift from Mueller's lawsuit and drastically reduced the amount Mueller could collect.
The singer-songwriter said in her countersuit that she wanted a symbolic $1 and the chance to stand up for other women.

Hundreds of Deeper Life Bible Church worshippers have escaped death when the LAGBUS conveying them from camp to Lagos burst into flames.
According to PM News, It was gathered that the worshippers were coming from the National Deeper Life Retreat on Sunday, caught fire on Otedola Bridge, Berger area of Lagos, Southwest Nigeria.
The bus took off from the Deeper Life Conference Centre, DLCC, Km 42, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway after the end of the four-day retreat.
On Otedola bridge, the bus carrying at least 100 worshippers was said to have burst into flames as people scamper to safety before the inferno could consume them.
Officials of the Lagos State Fire Services and the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, LASEMA arrived the scene on time to rescue worshippers before the LAGBUS was burnt in the inferno.
Any eye witness, who craved anonymity, told PM News that the bus was filled to capacity with worshippers when it caught fire, but that no life was lost.
He said the bus might have caught fire as a result of over heating.
According to him, several worshippers abandoned their loads as escaped to avoid being burnt in the inferno, saying that there was frantic scampering for safety by the passengers.
The source added that officials of the fire servicemen arrived on time to assist in evacuating the passengers from the burning bus. He said when worshippers suspected that a fire was about to be ignited, the asked the driver to stop and that when he did, they found every available means of escape before the fire fully engulfed the bus.
Worshippers were said to have gathered at one side of the road singing praises to God for saving them from being burnt to death after they just left an inspiring retreat where Pastor Williams Kumuyi of the Deeper Christian Life Ministry prayed for the for God's blessings and that they would not die untimely.
Director, Lagos State Fire Service, Rasak Fadipe said his men arrived the scene on time and were able to rescue worshippers and confirmed that life was lost. A LASEMA official who craved anonymity also confirmed that no life was lost but that the bus burnt complexly.
Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said people write off Cristiano Ronaldo at their peril after the Portuguese forward struck twice in the 5-0 drubbing of Sevilla on Saturday as the Spanish La Liga soccer champions and their prolific scorer roared back to life.
Ronaldo has been widely criticised in Spain for his domestic form this season and before the game with Sevilla he had only scored twice in the league, his lacklustre form mirroring Real's feeble defence of the title they won so convincingly last May.
Ronaldo was crowned world player of the year for a joint-record fifth time on Thursday and showed off his shiny Ballon d‘Or trophy on the Bernabeu pitch before kick off and when the game began he appeared to have an extra spring in his step.
He latched onto a through ball from Marco Asensio to confidently sidefoot the ball inside the near corner to score Real's second goal midway through the first half and then powered home the third from the penalty spot, his shot bouncing under Sevilla goalkeeper Sergio Rico.
“It has been a perfect week for him and I hope he continues at this pace, although I already said you have to be careful with him,” Zidane told a news conference.
Ronaldo also scored in Real's 3-2 win over Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday to become the first player ever to score in all six Champions League group games in one season.
“I don't say that for no reason, I know him well and I see how ambitious he is every day in training, he knows he's going to score.
Sometimes it doesn't come off for him and no-one is happy about that, but you always have to be careful with him.”
Zidane also praised Ronaldo's overall play, as the Portuguese helped tee-up 19-year-old right back Achraf Hakimi for the fifth goal of the game before the half-time whistle.
“After watching the game we can safely say we have got him back,” added the coach after Real moved to within five points of La Liga leaders Barcelona, who visited Villarreal yesterday.
We're very happy with the performance as it's not easy to score five goals against Sevilla.
I hope we can keep scoring, we've scored eight goals in our last two games and we have to keep going like this.
“We're growing in every sense and playing better. When you play better you create more chances, we created a lot today and scored five times, for the first time this season (in the league).”
Real left back Marcelo added: ”For me, Cristiano Ronaldo is the best player in the world. I never saw (Diego) Maradona or Pele play but I know you can't compare anyone to him.
We're privileged to live in the same era as (Lionel) Messi and Cristiano, each own has his own story and attributes, but I prefer Cristiano.” — Reuters.

NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to create health care company "free from profit-making incentives ".
LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — A retired Bolivian bishop tapped by Pope Francis to be a cardinal is furiously denying suggestions that he has a wife and children and is threatening legal action.
Toribio Ticona said Wednesday that he "has nothing to do" with the alleged actions and said he would bring a legal complaint if the claims continue.
Francis named the 81-year-old cardinal last week. Ticona says the accusations were disproven after they first emerged in 2011 and have "resurfaced as slander in an attempt to attack" the pope by "sectors that are hostile" to the pontiff.
The accusations recently appeared in the Catholic blog "Adelanto en la Fe" — "Forward in the Faith." It cites a 2011 complaint to local Catholic authorities that says Ticona had a family in a rural town.

The holidays are a time for gathering with friends, family, and — if you're Lady Gaga — the Haus of Gaga. The Joanne singer and her creative team celebrated Christmas with an array of “naughty elf” costumes this weekend. Gaga's sister dressed up as Mrs. Claus and the “Born This Way” hitmaker dubbed herself “Mistress Claus.”

Wearing long, pointy ears and a green bodysuit, Gaga merged the festive with the provocative. Her squad explored the theme in felt tree costumes, velvet capes and other campy fashions of the North Pole.
“We love you and wish you lots of cheers and no tears!” Gaga captioned the Instagram album. The singer is currently on tour promoting Joanne and preparing for the 2018 release of the film A Star Is Born. It was recently announced that Gaga would use her given name—Stefani Germanotta—in credits for the film.

Harmatan haze: How Nigerian pilots can avert air accidents
By Louis Ibah
The harmatan season is here with its characteristic dusty-cold wind blowing across the Sahara. For the Nigerian air transport industry, the season comes with some challenges. Weather conditions are so critical to the aviation sector. Therefore, the poor visibility associated with the harmatan haze makes it impossible for pilots to fly.
You fly all the time. Have you noticed that what the entire pilot tells you always is about weather? When he stabilises the aircraft and is cruising at a comfortable altitude, he will inform passengers that the en-route weather is either good or that there are a few clouds to encounter along the route and so passengers should expect some bumps.
In the last one week, airlines have to delay, reschedule or cancel their flights for safety purposes. And this comes with a huge loss in revenue to the airlines as well as an untold hardship and inconveniences to air passengers.
In fact, an estimated N200million is lost daily by airlines whenever they are forced to cancel, delay or reschedule flights in Nigeria.
NIMET warning
Director-General of Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET), Dr. Anthony Anuforom, had already forecasted that there would be moderate to severe outbreaks of dust haze during the period of November 2016 – March 2017 in Nigeria, which will reduce horizontal visibility significantly to 1,000meters and below in some parts of the country.
To forestall any air crash during the harmatan season, the Nigerian Meteorology Agency NIMET had warned airlines and pilots to ensure that prior to flight operations that they obtain adequate and accurate weather information from NIMET. Airlines are also advised to ensure that flight operations are scheduled with adequate weather information from NIMET to minimise delay or cancellation of flight operations and pilots in particular are warned to exercise maximum restraint when adverse weather is given by NIMET.
Poor navigations facilities
Ideally, with such warnings by NIMET coming months ahead of the onset of the harmatan season, one would have expected the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) and the Nigerian Airsapce Management Agency (NAMAS) to have swung into action by making the investments in the requisite technology that would boost aircraft take off and landing at various airports in the country even with the poor visibility associated with the harmatan. But sadly, that never occurred. According to the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) several flights, especially the early morning flights, are being grounded owing to the deplorable state of navigational aids at airports around the country which makes flying in the Nigerian airspace virtually impossible during the harmatan season.
The AON bemoaned the obsolete navigational and lightening aids in Nigerian airports saying most international and local flights had to be diverted to airports in nearby Cotouou, Benin Republic where facilities exist to support landing under harsh weather. The AON said 40 years ago on December 28, 1968 the first aircraft operated at Category Three (CAT lll) and landed in zero visibility at Heathrow airport, and wondered why Nigeria was unable to land aircraft with visibility of about 800meters in 2016.
Weather related air crashes
The most recent weather related air crash involved an Air France jet that hit a patch of thunderstorms and lightning over the Atlantic Ocean in 2009.
Air France Flight 447 left Rio de Janeiro heading for Paris May 31, 2009 carrying 228 people, according to news reports. The last contact with the plane came just after it hit a rough patch of weather and signaled a possible electrical malfunction.
Some analysts said a lightning strike could have disabled the plane, noting that there could have been several other weather warnings that the pilots may have failed to heed.
In Nigeria, the ADC and Sosoliso Airlines flights which crashed Abuja and Port Harcourt respectively have been linked to harsh weather. Accident investigators attribute the Sosoliso flight, which crashed on December 10, 2005 at the Port Harcourt International Airport killing 108 passengers and crew, including school children. to missed approach, a pilot error which was caused mainly by low level wind shear at the airport. Similarly, on October 29, 2006, there was the ADC Flight which crashed shortly after takeoff from the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, killing 105 passengers and five-crew. The cause was also linked to low-level wind shear. To conquer weather there must be accurate weather report, which airline operators must adhere to.
Therefore, based on the ADC and Sosoliso flights weather induced air-accidents and the spate of near-air-crashes that followed thereafter, the Federal Government had to invest massively in the development of weather information gathering and dissemination infrastructure at the Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NIMET). Wind shear alert system is not a cheap technology. It costs quite some money to install one. Prior to that ADC crash in 2006; there was no single wind shear alert system in any Nigerian airport. But after that and based on the recommendation of Accident and Investigation Bureau (AIB), Nigeria at present has equipped nine airports with wind shear alert system.
Greenhouse emissions
It however appears that weather conditions in Nigeria are getting worse and the impact on the aviation sector aggravated more with each passing year. Experts have therefore warned that at the root of the problem lies the degradation of the Nigerian environment.
Director-General of NIMET, Dr. Anthony Anuforom, in a paper presented recently to mark the convocation ceremony at the Enugu State University of Science and Technology (ESUT), explained why Nigeria has suddenly become highly vulnerable to Climate Changes. Nigerians are polluting the environment at a very alarming rate through the wrong use or disposal of chemical, industrial waste and deforestation without a corresponding effort to remediate the hazard.
In the lecture titled “Weather Observation, Modelling and Forecasting for Managing Climate Change Impacts”, Anforom opined that considering the “cross-cutting and multifaceted nature of climate change issues, greater inter-disciplinary research is recommended as no single organisation, Ministry, Department or Agency can tackle it alone.”
He also threw a big challenge to the academic community in Nigeria to rise up and contribute its quota to the resolution of climate change issues through vigorous research and establishment of basic weather observatories across the country in other to increase the density of weather data collection in Nigeria.
According to him, the Maplesoft Climate Change Vulnerability Index, places the country as the third most vulnerable country in the world. “This is an issue of serious concern that requires decisive and coordinated action,” said Anuforom.
The INDC effort
In order to nip these challenges in the bud, Anuforom said a Presidential Committee has finalised Nigeria's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions to Reduction in Green Gas Emission (INDC) with an adaptation component which gives speed to the project.
He said that the adaptation component of Nigeria's INDC is derived largely from the National Adaptation Strategy and Plan of Action for Climate Change Nigeria (NASPA-CCN). “The goal of the adaptation component spells out actions to be taken to reduce vulnerability to climate change impacts, minimise risks, increasing resilience, improving adaptive capacity, leveraging on new opportunities and facilitating collaboration within the country as well as the global community,” said Anuforom.
“The INDC outlines adaptation strategies for 13 sectors, namely: agriculture (Crop and Livestock), water Resources (Fresh and Coastal), forestry, biodiversity, health and sanitation, energy, human settlement and housing. There are also transportation and communication, industry and commerce; disaster management, migration and security, livelihoods, vulnerable groups and education
“Weather observation and forecasting, as well as other climate services provided by NIMET are required for implementing the strategies set out for most of the sectors,” Anuforom added.
To guarantee sustainable success, Anuforum recommended the resuscitation and completion of the Development of a National Framework for Application of Climate Services (NFACS) which was conceptual prized in 2013 to “provide a mechanism or platform that brings together climate information providers (such as NIMET), end-users, researchers and other stakeholders to facilitate the production and timely dissemination of science-based information”.
“Like the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) developed by WMO, the proposed NFACS will enable Nigerians manage the risks and opportunities arising from climate variability and change by providing science-based information to the most vulnerable and incorporating such information into planning, policy formulation and implementation at all levels of government”, the DG declared.
Anuforom said that with advancements in computing and ICT infrastructure, the weather forecasting procedure in NIMET has become highly modernised in the past few years. He said modern technology has eliminated the stress of manual data collection and analysis before a forecast is generated. He noted that the contemporary practice involves the use of supercomputers to produce Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) Models.
Anuforom said although the development of accurate weather report was a continuous process, the level so far attained in weather forecasting by NIMET enables it give accurate weather report for Nigeria and other countries in the ECOWAS sub-region.
Enforcing weather reports
The task of ensuring a safe sky in Nigeria is one that must be pursued by all stakeholders. There is therefore the need for the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) to ensure the enforcement of the bad weather data generated by NIMET by pilots and airlines.
Above all, the relevant agencies at the airports need to invest in modern navigation aids and runway lights in line with global trend. That way aircraft can fly under any weather conditions at Nigerian airports. Passengers should also show restrain and understanding whenever flights are cancelled or delays due to weather conditions because it is in the interest of safety.
Also, the planned concession or privatisation of Nigerian airports might be a way forward provided it is transparent and with a clear agenda as the concessionaire would make sure these landing aids are in place at the airports they bought-over or manage under a concession deal with the government.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) – SpaceX is about to launch a few tons of research to the International Space Station – plus ice cream.
An unmanned Falcon 9 rocket is scheduled to blast off at 12:31 p.m. Monday from Florida's Kennedy Space Center.
Experiments make up most of the 6,400 pounds of cargo. That includes 20 mice.
The Dragon capsule is also doubling as an ice cream truck this time.
There was extra freezer space, so NASA packed little cups of vanilla, chocolate and birthday cake ice cream for the station's crew of six, as well as ice cream candy bars.
Those treats should be especially welcomed by U.S. astronaut Peggy Whitson, in orbit since November.
As usual on these cargo flights, SpaceX will try to land its leftover booster back at Cape Canaveral.

If you think the UniParty attacks upon President Trump are vitriolic now, just wait until President Trump presents his budget proposal to congress; that's when the UniParty is really going to go bananas, and every crony-conservative pundit and radio talker will simultaneously demand Trump immediately spend more money.
These politicians will demand more spending. Notice anything familiar about them?
The federal fiscal year runs from October 1st to September 31st annually. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 requires the President to submit his budget request for the upcoming fiscal year no later than the first Monday of February.
However, in the first year of the first term of each administration – congress waives the statutory deadline because so much of the election and campaign is structured around fiscal budget and tax policy. The waiver gives the incoming administration time to construct their budget after the inauguration. Historic reference:
Year One Bill Clinton budget was delivered on 4/8/93 (66 days past deadline).
Year One GW Bush budget was delivered on 4/9/01 (63 days past deadline).
Year One Barack Obama budget was delivered on 5/11/09 (98 days past deadline).
Currently President Trump is in the process of putting his budget together. Heck, the Senate hasn't even confirmed Trump's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director, Mick ‘Cantalopes‘ Mulvaney.
But one thing is abundantly clear President Trump has already stated his expressed intention to bring the federal budget to balance within his first term.
To comprehend the scope of this budgetary dynamic, consider the first four months of fiscal year 2017 (October 1, 2016 through Jan 31, 2017) which was just announced:
♦ Receipts through January totaled $1,084 billion [$1.08 trillion], CBO estimates—$5 billion more than the amount for the same period last year.
♦ Outlays for the first four months of fiscal year 2017 were $1,243 billion [$1.24 trillion], CBO estimates—$4 billion more than they were during the same period last year.
If not for shifts in the timing of certain payments from October 2016 to September 2016 because October 1 fell on a weekend, outlays would have been $45 billion (or 4 percent) greater.
The Federal Government took in a record $1.08 Trillion, and yet spent $1.24 Trillion.
That's running a 13% deficit spending rate of $159 billion more than the treasury took in (mostly due to ObamaCare).
Tomorrow, President Trump is meeting with retail CEO's to discuss economic growth:
[…] The meeting will include Target CEO Brian Cornell, Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly, Gap Inc CEO Art Peck, Autozone Inc CEO William Rhodes, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc CEO Stefano Pessina, J.C. Penney Company Inc CEO Marvin Ellison, Jo-Ann Stores LLC CEO Jill Soltau and Tractor Supply Co CEO Gregory Sandfort, according to the people familiar with the matter. This is the first time well-known retail CEOs will descend on Washington as a group to try to make the case that a controversial proposal to tax all imports will raise consumer prices and hurt their businesses. Their input has more urgency as Trump is finalizing his own tax plan that he plans to unveil in the coming weeks. (read more)
No single issue will lose President Trump more voter support than if he caves on this budget and allows the UniParty to continue deficit spending. Accounting gimmicks are not going to work any longer. The SSI trust funds have been emptied and void. Federal spending to prop up Obamacare is blowing a $1.3 trillion hole in the budget each year, and it's getting worse.
Those who have lived by scheme and graft amid the DC Swamp are going to fight to keep the spending levels as high as possible; and we can well expect to see the idiots who attend CPAC each year begin to broadcast messages that President Trump must spend more.
Wait for it…
…Some of those who will demand more spending. Watch!
LONDON (AP) – Big Ben will fall silent next week in London as a major restoration project gets underway.
The bongs of the iconic bell will be stopped on August 21 to protect workers during a 4 year $38 million conservation project that includes repair of the Queen Elizabeth Tower, which houses Big Ben and its clock.
Steve Jaggs, keeper of the Great Clock, said Monday that the mechanism will be dismantled piece by piece and its four dials will be cleaned and repaired.
Big Ben has been stopped several times since it first sounded in 1859, but the current restoration project will mark the longest period of silence for the bell. It will still sound on big occasions, such as Remembrance Sunday.

…my vindication today calls for celebration – Saraki
Respite came the way of the Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, Wednesday, as the Code of Conduct Tribunal, CCT, sitting in Abuja, dismissed the entire 18-count criminal charge the Federal Government preferred against him.
In a unanimous decision, the two-panel panel tribunal headed by Justice Danladi Umar, held that FG failed to prove essential elements of all the allegations it levelled against Saraki.
Saraki responding to the the victory in a statement said .my vindication today calls for celebration.
Saraki said “You would recall that at the beginning of the trial, I maintained that I will clear my name. The conclusion of this trial has vindicated my position. With the outcome of this case, our faith is renewed in our courts and our hope is restored that the judiciary in our country could indeed provide sanctuary for all those who seek justice,” he said.
“I thank the Almighty Allah, the ultimate Judge and the repository of all powers. He alone has brought about this victory. I am immensely grateful to all my colleagues in the national assembly for their abiding support. All through my trial, they demonstrated their strong conviction about the choice we all decided to make two years ago. I thank members of my family for their unflinching support. I thank all friends and supporters back home in Kwara state and across the length and breadth of our country for their prayers and their sacrifices. My gratitude also goes to all members of my legal team for their tireless efforts to ensure the cause of justice is served.
“After undergoing the crucible of a tortuous trial, my vindication today calls for celebration. It is my belief however that if there should be any celebration at all, it should be a celebration of the hopes that this judgment gives us as citizens that despite all the challenges that we face as a country, we are well on our way to building a country where the innocent needs not be afraid. I therefore urge all my supporters to refrain from any unbridled triumphalism. The challenges that our country faces today are enormous and do not allow for wanton celebration. Instead, we should all reflect on the significance of this moment and what it meant for our democracy.
“On a personal note, I harbour no grudge against anyone, regardless of the role they might have played in the persecution that I had endured in the last two years. I believe that If my trial had in anyway given hope to the common man that no matter the forces arraigned against him, he can still get justice in our courts, then my tribulation had not been in vain.
“Once again, I thank my colleagues in the 8th senate for standing firm. Regardless of the distraction of my trial, we have achieved more than legislators than the previous senates. Now that this distraction is over, we can even achieve so much more. We must now proceed from here with greater vigour to deliver on the expectations of Nigerians and show that this 8th senate can indeed play a central role in improving the quality of lives of our people.”

Dear Amy: I was snooping in my son's basement and discovered he is growing weed. Should I confront him? He could lose his job, house, reputation and shared custody of his daughter.
I am a nervous wreck thinking about how to approach him. My husband would have a stroke if he found out. I know I should do something, but what?
-- Sad Mom
Dear Sad: Here's what you should do: Stop snooping in your son's basement.
Unless he has a sophisticated commercial marijuana ranch down there, you should assume this is for his own use, and leave it alone.
If you absolutely cannot stand it and must confront him about this, you will have to tell him the truth about your own behavior. One natural consequence of your admission would be for him to stop trusting you.
If you are ready to make this sacrifice, you should only urge him not to expose his child to his marijuana growing and weed use. Obviously, if you found this in the basement, so could she, and this would put his daughter in an even worse position than you are in, because involving her in this sort of secret could be ruinous for their relationship, and disastrous down the line.
State laws regarding marijuana cultivation seem to be quite convoluted. If he doesn't have a license to grow and is caught (by someone other than you) the consequences could be extreme in proportion to his crime.
Dear Amy: My daughter, 9, is in Girl Scouts. She loves it. I offer a lot of my time helping out the troop. Today, they went to an ice show in which the troop paid for the tickets, so this was not an out-of-pocket expense for us.
The parents were asked to either provide a snack for their daughters, or send money for the girls to buy a snack. We opted to send a snack instead of sending money, as we struggle financially.
Once they got there, they realized that you can't bring snacks in to the facility (understandable), so one of the troop leaders purchased popcorn buckets for each girl.
All the other girls brought money and were able to purchase their own drinks to go with the popcorn.
My daughter did not have any money with her, so her troop leader bought her a drink with a souvenir cup. My daughter thinks it cost around $15. I emailed the troop leaders and asked how much the souvenir/drink was and offered to reimburse them for it.
I felt like this was the right thing to do. However, my husband disagrees. He feels as though I shouldn't have offered, since we basically followed their initial instructions.
I know this is a small problem but every time someone purchases something on my kids' behalf without us asking, I feel obligated to at least offer to reimburse them when I have the funds. I know they can answer, "No -- don't worry about it." Am I wrong for offering to reimburse the troop leader? Or is my husband right?
-- Confused Girl Scout Mom
Dear Confused: You did the right thing. These troop leaders volunteer their time to help supervise the girls, and in addition to spending their time, they willingly spend money on all sorts of little (and large) things along the way. It was kind of this troop leader to purchase this treat for your daughter. You can assume that she did so very happily and does not expect to be reimbursed, since this was an unanticipated expense.
Of course you should acknowledge this and (if you're able) offer to reimburse her. You can expect her to turn down your offer, but your gesture is a nice way of acknowledging her kindness without making specific assumptions. She was being nice, and now you will be nice in return. That is the social contract your husband doesn't seem to understand.
Dear Amy: The man signing his letter "No Prior Precedent" described his wife's adult biological daughter, who she had surrendered for adoption at birth, entering their lives as an adult and wanting her biological mother to readopt her.
It is quite obvious that this person wants money. Once she is legally their child, she stands to inherit their money.
-- Seeing the Obvious
Dear Obvious: State laws differ, but generally children do not have an automatic right to inherit. And the prospect of inheritance does not always motivate people seeking a relationship with their parents.
The school bus driver charged in a crash on Interstate 80 in Morris County earlier this month that left a Paramus middle school teacher and a 10-year-old student dead was released from jail as he awaits trial.
A Superior Court judge said Hudy Muldrow, 77, of Woodland Park, will remain free ahead of his trial. He was released on the condition that he turn in his driver's license and check in with pre-trial services twice a month.
Muldrow is charged with two counts of death by auto in the May 17 crash with a dump truck that killed a teacher and fifth-grade student from East Brook Middle School in Paramus.
Authorities say Muldrow missed an exit on Interstate 80 and later attempted to make an illegal U-turn while driving 44 passengers from Paramus to Waterloo Village on Byram on a school trip.
The bus was struck from behind by a dump truck traveling in the center lane of I-80 in Mount Olive. It was ripped apart and landed on the center median of the highway.
Muldrow has received eight speeding tickets over the years and his license has been suspended multiple times -- most due to parking tickets or administrative snafus.
Willie Clark, a pastor at Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Jersey City told reporters last week that Muldrow is "sad" but doesn't believe he did anything wrong.
His son, Hudy Muldrow Jr. has said that his father is a "good driver."

Ethiopian Airlines lands Airbus in Abuja Tuesday
The Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport will be open for traffic from Tuesday and Ethiopian Airlines says it will land a brand-new Airbus A350-900 to mark the official reopening of the airport on Wednesday.
The Airline's Traffic and Sales Manager, Mrs. Firiehiwot Mekonnen, made this known, on Monday, in Abuja.
Mekonnen said that the aircraft would land in Abuja on its first day of operation from Addis Ababa and that it would remain on Abuja route.
The airline launched its first A350-900 Airbus on the London Heathrow route August last year. It has three of the plane in its fleet and awaits the delivery of nine more before 2019.
She said that the decision to celebrate the inaugural flight to Abuja was because of the airline's commitment to the Nigerian market.
According to the manager, the 313-passenger capacity aircraft is expected to land at 11.15 am to be the first aircraft to land at the newly rehabilitated Abuja runway.
“The Ethiopian's brand-new Airbus A350-900 is landing in Abuja airport tomorrow (Tuesday) as the first aircraft to land on the newly rehabilitated runway and first airbus to land in Abuja.
“From now on, we are going to operate Airbus on Abuja route,'' she said.
When Abuja Airport was closed on March 8 for repairs on its runway and flight operations were diverted to Kaduna International Airport, Ethiopian Airlines was the first to land its new Boeing 787 in Kaduna.
The airline, being the only international carrier that agreed to operate at Kaduna, had maintained consistent operation at the airport in the last six weeks.
Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State had also requested that the airline maintained its Kaduna operation even after the reopening of Abuja airport.
Mokennen said that the airline “is seriously considering the governor's request”. (NAN)

It seems Beyoncé and Jay-Z's daughter Blue Ivy has an appreciation for fine art -- and a bank account to fuel it.
While attending the second annual Wearable Art Gala with her famous parents in Los Angeles Saturday, the confident 6-year-old bid on an acrylic painting of a young Sidney Poitier, valued at $16,000. The starting bid for the art piece was $10,000 and in footage shared online from a fan account, Blue is seen raising her hand at $19,000, with Jay-Z attempting to stop her in jest.
Vanity Fair reported that director Tyler Perry ultimately placed a winning bid on the painting for $20,000.
However, the magazine also noted that Blue took home another piece of art for the whopping price of $10,000 -- deconstructed law books from Indiana and medical books from California by artist Samuel Levi Jones. Her mother reportedly also won a set of Lorraine Schwartz panther earrings for a winning bid of $17,000.
The night was a special one for the Carter family for more than one reason, though. Beyoncé was also recognized for her humanitarian work at the gala, which was hosted by her mother, Tina Knowles-Larson, and stepfather, Richard Larson.
"I feel very overwhelmed and I feel really full and really blessed and fortunate," the singer said in a speech at the event. "There's something that feels very off about receiving this award from my mother. She raised me to believe that giving was not an option, but a privilege and a responsibility. I think the real reason I feel weird to receive this award from my mother is because I feel like I should be giving her an award tonight."
Many data and analytics leaders face a chicken and egg situation. Without experienced data scientists, venturing into machine learning and data science is difficult. Without any successful pilots, getting serious business commitment to fund data science projects and hire data scientists is equally challenging.
Most organisations are still in the early phases of their data science journey and struggle to understand what machine learning and data science can do for them. They don't exactly know which skills are needed and hiring data scientists seems really difficult.
According to a recent Gartner survey, more than 40 percent of organisations practicing advanced analytics say a lack of adequate skills is a challenge. Hiring experienced candidates can be difficult for a number of reasons:
Experienced data scientists will want to avoid being the first to join a company.
The amount of energy needed to just get access to data, integrate it and have the first machine-learning models deployed into the business can be staggering.
There's a limited pool of available candidates.
Retaining quality data scientists is also a struggle. They currently favour job hopping as this gives them more exposure to a broader range of tasks — ideally in different industries.
What options do you have?
You don't have to have a large data science lab to be able to take advantage of machine learning. Start small and evolve the following competencies:
Train existing staff into (citizen) data scientists
Partner with academia
Hire third-party professionals
Use packaged applications
Many organisations have mathematically skilled employees without knowing it. They might have been math geeks since high school or are using their quantitative skills in other roles.
The right employees just need to possess the following important characteristics:
The right mindset — curiosity and entrepreneurial drive.
A holistic attitude — the whole data science pipeline, from data collection to delivery of the analytics results, must be questioned and analysed.
The right dose of mathematical affinity — data is often noisy and messy, and the situations data scientists deal with are loaded with uncertainty and high dimensionality.
Many universities and colleges now offer data science related degrees. Using universities for specific projects serves the dual purpose of an organisation getting skilled resources, while also providing students with real-world learning experiences.
The relationship can take four main forms: internships, class projects, innovation labs or hackathons. Coca-Cola, for example, partners with Georgia-Tech in the U.S. for innovation in machine learning and robotics.
It's best to utilise senior academics that know the business processes and quantitative methods in your area really well. Get them to advise you. They will benefit from the practical traction with you, and in turn, you will benefit from their knowledge and their students.
In this time of immense machine learning skills shortage, third-party professionals can accelerate and kickstart the success of data science programs. There are hundreds of consultancies that can provide a spectrum of assistance, from creating project ideas, early piloting, coaching and teaching of junior staff, to the fully fledged creation of managed services.
Analytics service suppliers should provide the following:
Upskilling of existing staff - Suppliers can educate existing math literate staff and even further assist in hiring full-time data scientists.
- Suppliers can educate existing math literate staff and even further assist in hiring full-time data scientists. A range of value-adding knowledge assets and knowledge – frameworks, collateral and knowledge artefacts that improve solution quality, repeatability, project delivery effectiveness and time to value.
– frameworks, collateral and knowledge artefacts that improve solution quality, repeatability, project delivery effectiveness and time to value. Critical thinking, imagination and creativity – They shouldn't be solely focused on project execution.
– They shouldn't be solely focused on project execution. A learning experience and knowledge transfer – Coaching and mentoring your in-house team will ensure that the data science capability is sustainable beyond the term of engagement.
It's important to perform a thorough assessment of your internal advanced analytics capabilities to determine which service provider engagement and pricing model is the most suitable for your overall advanced analytics program in relation to skills, funding and bandwidth.
Machine learning capabilities are often packaged as targeted software applications to solve specific problems. In fact, there's already an enormous wealth of prefabricated solutions available, and it's growing all the time.
These solutions often provide superb cost-time-risk trade-offs, significantly lower the skills barrier and can provide a solution much faster than creating one from scratch. Even for organisations with larger data science teams, packaged applications are an important consideration, especially as a productivity gain.

Amazon could be one step closer to dominating your household. According to Bloomberg, Amazon is building smart robots as part of a project named “Vesta.”
The robots may launch as soon as 2019, according to the report, which says they'll be equipped with cameras that let them drive around our homes. Amazon has reportedly increased the number of hires for the project, which will form part of a “smart team of doers that work passionately to apply cutting-edge advances in robotics and software to solve real-world challenges” in order to “transform” their customers' experiences in ways they “can't even imagine yet.”
According to Bloomberg, Lab126 intends to roll out the prototype robots into employees' homes by the end of the year, with commercial prototypes possibly becoming available early next year. The information comes from “people briefed on the plan,” but Amazon refused to comment on “rumors and speculation” when Bloomberg reached out for further confirmation.
Advances in computer-vision technology, cameras, artificial intelligence and voice activation help make it feasible for Amazon to bring its robot to the marketplace.
Eventually, robots and driverless cars will be the new normal. Amazon is just trying to beat everyone to launch first.

RIO DE JANEIRO — At least 60 inmates died during a prison riot in the northern state of Amazonas, including several who were beheaded or dismembered, in the biggest killing at a Brazilian prison since 1992.
Authorities said the riot apparently grew out of a fight between two of the country's biggest crime gangs over control of prisons and drug routs in northern Brazil.
Amazonas state public security secretary Sergio Fontes said that in addition to the deaths, some inmates escaped from the Anisio Jobim Penitentiary Complex in Manaus, but he did not say how many. He added that 40 had been recaptured.
Twelve prison guards were held hostage by the inmates, though none was wounded during the riot that began Sunday afternoon and ended Monday morning.
“This is the biggest prison massacre in our state's history,” Fontes said during a press conference. “What happened here is another chapter of the war that narcos are waging on this country and it shows that this problem cannot be tackled only by state governments.”
Fontes confirmed that many of the dead had been beheaded and Judge Luis Carlos Valois, who negotiated the end of the riot with inmates, said he saw many bodies that were quartered.
“I never saw anything like that in my life. All those bodies, the blood,” Valois wrote on Facebook.
It was the largest death toll during a Brazilian prison riot since the killing of 111 inmates by police officers in the Carandiru penitentiary in São Paulo in 1992. Police said they acted in self-defence then.
Two other prisons in Manaus also reported riots on Monday. In one of them 87 prisoners escaped, including one that posted a picture of him on Facebook as he left. Amazonas police are investigating whether there is a link between the incidents in the three prisons.
By the end of Monday afternoon Amazonas state police said the situation had become stable in all three prisons.
Brazilian daily Estado de S.Paulo later reported that federal police were investigating whether Valois has links to one of the gangs involved in the incident.
Fontes said the inmates made few demands to end the riot, which hints at a killing spree organized by members of a local gang, the Family of the North, against those of the First Command of the Capital that is based in São Paulo.
The secretary said that officers found a hole in a prison wall through which weapons entered the building. A policeman was wounded in exchange of fire with the inmates. Several firearms were found in the post-riot search by police.
The First Command, nationally known as PCC, is the most powerful drug and prison gang in Brazil and it has been trying to extend its reach to northern prisons dominated by the Family of the North. To counter, Family of the North associated with the Red Commando of Rio de Janeiro, the second biggest crime gang in Brazil.
Valois said that during the negotiations, inmates only asked “that we did not transfer them, made sure they were not attacked and kept their visitation.”
The riot ended after the inmates freed the last of the 12 prison staffers they had held hostage, Valois said.
Gabrielle Leith Bentzoni, 19, is wanted for failure to appear for a bail hearing after being charged with theft, according to the Northampton County Sheriff's Department.
Bentzoni, last known to frequent the Bangor area, is described as 5 feet 5 inches tall and 110 pounds with brown hair and hazel eyes.
The sheriff's department asks anyone with information about Bentzoni to call Sgt. George Volpe his contact number is 610-829-6527.
For drivers that want to go faster than the law allows while simultaneously learning how to be better behind the wheel, the automaker has introduced the Performance Data Recorder (PDR). The onboard computer tracks 34 channels of performance while recording video. It replaces the aftermarket GoPro mounted to the windshield and performance tracking systems drivers place in their track cars with an easy to understand and use the system.
The recorder fires up directly from the infotainment system with only two taps. It's so simple, on the first try I thought I missed a few steps. Sure, it said it was recording, but was it really? To my delight after pushing the stop button and parking the car, I was able to watch back my drive right there with data overlays of my speed, tachometer, which gear I was in, and what g-force I was pulling around corners. It's super nerdy, yet simultaneously helpful.
For example, you might be that person that veers out of their lane while cornering but don't really notice. With evidence right there in front of you, you'll start to make a conscious effort of staying in your lane on switchbacks. The rest of us on the road will also appreciate it.
The teaching tool only gets better when you transfer the video (stored on an SD card in the glove compartment) to the Cosworth application (Windows only). The app displays your drive on a map along with an incredible amount of detail, such as steering angle or pressure applied to the brakes and accelerator. It's an extravaganza of data that should appease both data nerds and car nuts.
My biggest fault with the system is that the videos are only 720p. They're good enough for Twitter and Facebook sharing, but if you watch them on your TV, the quality is disappointing.
Sure, with all that power, you might be tempted drift your way around every corner, and thankfully the steering feels precise. The result is that I always felt completely in control of the situation. Plus, the car feels lighter than previous generation Corvettes thanks to an aluminum frame and carbon fiber everywhere.
The interior is pure sports car. The racing seats keep you from sliding around the cabin during your recreations of the Fast and Furious. But after three or four hours they do start to wear on your body especially if you happen to skip cardio days at the gym. The steering wheel is wrapped in carbon fiber and suede. The latter for better grip. Everything in the car is driver-centric -- the center dash is pointed so far away from the passenger their climate controls are mounted on to the very right below the vent.
The infotainment system suffered just a hint of latency. I hoped Chevrolet would update it for the 65th anniversary Vette. Alas, it's adequate and with Android Auto and CarPlay support, you'll likely only use it for the PDR. The dash cluster, on the other hand, is a wealth of knowledge from the typical speed limits and tire pressure to a timer that tracks your zero to 60 runs (and tells you how warm your tires are).
Then there's the secret compartment. Well, it's not really a secret, there's a big button that says "screen" next to it. When you push that, the 8-inch display lowers to reveal an additional storage area revealing enough room for my phone, wallet and sunglasses. When friends would get in the car expecting me to do donuts at every intersection (I didn't), instead I'd show them the compartment. In a car which has a trunk that's capable of transporting two pieces of carry-on luggage and not much else, any additional storage is welcome.
That little storage area is like the rest of the Corvette. Fun but completely impractical -- which is what a sports car should be. It's something you drive to go fast even though 80 percent of the time, you're not going to use more than 10 percent of it's potential.
But the potential to do easily do donuts in abandoned parking lots is there and when you do find a stretch of empty road in the desert or make it to the track, the car delivers. That said, you really don't have to drop over $100,000 to put a Corvette in your garage.
Let's take a quick look at that $111,000 price point of the Carbon 65 version. Again Chevy will only make 650 of these so you're probably not going to get one anyway. Plus, there's a Z06 Corvette with a manual transmission (you should only buy this car with manual transmission) starting at about $80,000. That's still a lot of money but for the power and features you're getting, it's a steal compared to offerings from Porsche, Ferrari, Audi and other automakers.
Plus it's just a fun car to be in. Of course, once you're over the age of 40 everyone thinks you're having a mid-life crisis (and maybe you are) when you're seen in the vehicle. And again it's one of the least practical cars you can purchase. But who cares, it's a Corvette and after 65 years it still quickens the pulse and with the PDR system, you can note the exact moment that happened.
The arrival of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang cannot come quickly enough for Arsenal.
A 3-1 loss on Tuesday to Swansea, which started the match as the Premier League's last-place team, punctured some of the optimism generated by the imminent signing of one of Europe's most lethal strikers.
Aubumeyang flew to London earlier in the day to put the finishing touches to a drawn-out transfer from Borussia Dortmund that Arsenal hopes will be completed on Wednesday, the final day of the January transfer window.
He would be joining a team that slipped eight points off the Champions League qualification positions as a result of the chastening loss in south Wales. Arsenal has just 13 games to claw back the deficit, or it will be out of Europe's elite competition for a second straight season.
Swansea midfielder Sam Clucas scored either side of a goal by Jordan Ayew following a dreadful error by Arsenal goalkeeper Petr Cech, who miskicked a clearance straight to the striker.
Olivier Giroud came on as a late substitute for what could be his last appearance for Arsenal, with Aubameyang arriving as a direct replacement for the France striker. Giroud waved to Arsenal's traveling fans before the leaving the pitch after the final whistle.
Asked about the departure of Giroud and the arrival of Aubameyang, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said all will be revealed on Wednesday morning.
Henrikh Mkhitaryan played the final half hour in his first appearance for Arsenal since joining from Manchester United in a swap deal with Alexis Sanchez.
Fourth-place Liverpool capitalized on Arsenal's slip-up by beating Huddersfield 3-0 away to move eight points clear of Wenger's team. Emre Can, Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah — from the penalty spot — were the scorers.
West Ham drew 1-1 with Crystal Palace in the other game.

Valentin Breiz's PS4 Linux Loader, the tool that makes it possible to hack your PlayStation 4 gaming console to install a Linux-based operating system, has been updated to work with newer firmware.
Previously designed to work only with PlayStation 4 firmware 4.55 and then with firmware 5.50, Valentin Breiz updated its PS4 Linux Loader utility to also support PlayStation 4 models that run the firmware 5.01 or 5.05. In addition, it would appear that the PS4 Linux Loader tool also supports PlayStation 4 Pro models.
PS4 Linux Loader is a payload tool created by developer Valentin Breiz and it leverages IDC's kernel exploit to let you install Linux on your PlayStation 4 running a supported firmware. However, the hack still does not support some PlayStation 4 models that have a disk drive formatted with the FAT filesystem. A full list of supported models can be found here.
Of course, this comes as great news for the PlayStation 4 homebrew community who wants to hack their gaming console and run a Linux-based operating system. The latest PS4 firmware is version 5.55, which isn't yet vulnerable to the kernel exploit used by the PS4 Linux Loader tool, so don't update to it if you want to install Linux on your PlayStation 4.
Here's how to run Linux on your PlayStation 4 with firmware 5.01 or 5.05 and PS4 Pro
If you have one of the supported PlayStation 4 models running firmware 4.55, 5.01, and 5.05, or a PlayStation 4 Pro, you can install Linux with the PS4 Linux Loader tool created by Valentin Breiz by downloading the bzImage and initramfs.cpio.gz files from here and the respective PS4 Linux Loader binary from developer's GitHub page.
Place all the files on a USB flash drive formatted with a FAT32 filesystem. Then insert the USB stick into one of your PlayStation 4's USB ports and point the PS4 web browser to darbness.com/ps4 to send the payload using netcat, or use Valentin Breiz's PS4 Payload Sender tool, which can be downloaded from his GitHub page (link above).
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has marked the country's 37th anniversary of independence with a call for tranquility even as the economy has collapsed to the point where livestock is being accepted in place of cash.
The 93-year-old Mugabe broke his tradition of walking the 100 meters to the podium and instead was driven in his official car before soldiers helped him into place.
Mugabe has been in power since the end of British colonial rule.
This once-prosperous country now faces a cash crisis and high unemployment. A bill presented to parliament last week would have banks accept livestock as collateral for loans. And an education official has said livestock can be accepted as school fees.
World leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin sent congratulatory messages to mark the independence anniversary.

A junior police officer stationed at ZRP Ntabazinduna Training Depot's finance department allegedly defrauded his employer of more than $200 000 in projects funds.
Fidelis Chivavava (28) of Pumula South yesterday appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Tinashe Tashaya facing seven counts of fraud involving $206 048, 47.
The magistrate remanded him out of custody to February 28 on $200 bail.
He ordered Chivavava to report twice a week at the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) Commercial Crimes Division offices in Bulawayo and to reside at his given address until the matter is finalised.
The magistrate also ordered Chivavava, who is already on suspension, not to interfere with investigations as part of the bail conditions.
The court heard that between January 1 and December 31, 2015, Chivavava was the acting finance clerk at ZRP Ntabazinduna Depot and responsible for withdrawing, holding in trust the withdrawn funds, conducting payments for suppliers and reconciling the money.
During the period between September 21 and December 31, 2016, Chivavava allegedly connived with Shonhiwa Mushonga, one Oswald, Tafadzwa Sibanda, Kelvin Moyo and Sibonginkosi Dube and transferred $14 785 belonging to ZRP Ntabazinduna Training Depot's Mess account into their individual accounts.
During the same year, the accused person stole $19 652 from his employer's coffers and purportedly indicated in the financial books that he paid $2 700 to Oscaria Bakery, $10 052.02 to Fortwell Wholesalers, $800 to Moyo and $5 102 to Dube. He converted the money to his personal use and in the process prejudiced ZRP of $19 652.02.
He later on double paid one Mrs E Mpofu $2 218 for goods received using the same invoice and prejudiced his employer of $1 109.
Between 18 and 19 January this year an internal audit was carried out at ZRP Ntabazinduna Training Depot and it was discovered that a total of $206 048,47 was missing.
When Chivavava was engaged over the issued he failed to account for the money. A report was made to police at Mbembesi on February 10 leading to his arrest.
The State had opposed bail through Mr Taurai Hondoyemoto, arguing that Chivavava was likely to abscond due to the gravity of the offence.
He also argued that there was no guarantee that if given bail, the accused would not interfere with ongoing investigations.
However, the magistrate ruled that the State failed to give compelling reasons warranting denial of bail.
“The reasons for opposing bail, which were proffered by the State, are not satisfactory.
“There is no way that accused would interfere with investigations since he is on suspension and in any case you don't arrest a person before conducting investigations.
“The investigating officer is just speculating and I do not understand the State's fears that accused would abscond, particularly taking into account that he turned himself in to the police when he heard that they were looking for him,” said Mr Tashaya. The Chronicle
How Nigeria's losing $6.5bn cotton export revenue
Stories by Steve Agbota styvenchy@yahoo.com 08033302331
Cotton farming in Nigeria has received very little attention from various governments over the past two decades. This has however made the commodity to witness continuous decline in production. With its contribution to GDP dropping from 25 per cent to 4 per cent.
Lack of improved seeds, access to extension services and low prices of the produce have been noted as the major setback over these years as Nigeria is said to be losing about $6.5 billion export opportunities in cotton annually. It has also been revealed that the country spends $4 billion annually importing textiles and readymade clothing, which could have gone into the pocket of Nigerian farmers if the industry is revived.
Already, Nigeria is missing out among the selected 15 African countries on the share of cotton in product exports by the World Cotton Market on cottonguide.org, where Burkina Faso ranked number one along with Benin with exports of 71.5 per cent and 63.2 per cent while Mali, Zimbabwe and Togo possessed exports of 35.6 per cent, 12.4 per cent and 11.7 per cent respectively.
However, United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda recorded exports of 6.4 per cent and 5.7 per cent respectively while Cameroon and Zambia also accounted for exports of 5.6 per cent and 5.4 per cent respectively. Meanwhile, Malawi, Sudan and Cote d'lvoire have exports of 3.8 per cent, 2.5 per cent and 2.2 per cent while Burundi, Ghana and Central African Republic possessed exports of 1.8 per cent, 0.8 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively.
Cotton farmers, especially in Northern Nigeria, have been lamenting over recording low yield and returns despite working hard and investing so much in the production of cotton. This development forced many farmers to divert attention to the cultivation of other crops like maize, sorghum, soybean and cassava.
Today, cotton which is essentially produced for its fibre, which is universally used as a textile raw material served as an important commodity in the world economy and is being used more than any other fibre. For instance, in the United States of America, cotton is a leading cash crop and at the farm level alone, the production of each year's crop involves the purchase of more than $5.3 billion worth of supplies and service. It also stimulates business activities for factories and enterprises throughout the country.
However, processing and handling of cotton after it leaves the farm generates even more business activity. Annual business revenue stimulated by cotton in the US economy exceeds $120 billion, making cotton America's number one value-added crop.
Considering the arable fertile land Nigeria possesses, with the important use of cotton across the country and the world, coupled with states like Kaduna, Kastina, Zamfara, Sokoto, Ondo, Ogun, Oyo, Osun and others where cotton grows, farmers say Nigeria can achieve 60 to 70 per cent of what America is getting today if government at various levels could provide improved seeds, fertilizer, modern equipment like tractors for clearing of land and give right supports.
In order to revive the cotton industry, stakeholders said Nigerian authorities must adopt biotechnology cotton, which they say has a high potential for added value.
On the fears of health implications of Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) products, the European Union (EU), World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), clarified that GMO has no adverse effect on humans and the environment.
The industry will continue to witness tremendous decline in production of high yielding, pest and disease-resistant variety such as the biotechnology cotton failed to be fully adopted by the Federal Government, according to stakeholders.
The biotechnology cotton, which is genetically modified by agricultural biotechnologists have some advantages such as bollworm resistance and high yield, was adopted by Burkina Faso, Senegal, Kenya and Mali, among other African countries, and they have benefited significantly from it, as farmers in these countries are earning millions of dollars from export markets.
Speaking with Daily Sun, Director General, Nigeria Textile Manufacturers Association, Mr. Hamma Kwajaffa, said government should be blamed for the decline in cotton production because of its policy summersault.
He said initially, right from colonial days, government had been involved in cotton production, adding that railway was built for cotton to be transported from the North to the coast for industrial revolution, which was very effective. He stated: “When Nigerian government took over, there was a cotton board and marketing board. During the economic liberalisation of 1986, government allowed everybody to be doing it on free business forgetting that cotton is a scientific crop and most of our farmers are illiterate and if anything happens, even if you over apply fertilizer or you over spray, your crops are definitely going to decline.
“When farmers are farming and their crops are facing decline in production, there are other cash crops they can grow, so most of them migrated from cotton production to other crops that were paying them better considering the level of scientific procedure involved in producing cotton.”
On reviving the industry, he said former Minister of Agriculture, Dr. Adewunmi Adesina, tried to revamp the cotton industry but his efforts were frustrated.
He explained: “The former Minister invited people from Australia to come and give him the roadmap on cotton production. The people recommended that they should have cotton corporation within the value chain as a board to guide the production. Adesina presented the plans to the government but at the Federal Executive Council, the Federal Ministry of Trade and Investment went against it arguing that Adesina was trespassing into its own schedule; that it was the industry ministry that should be talking about cotton corporation not agriculture. So that was how his efforts were frustrated and the whole thing declined.”
He said government should now graciously revisit those schemes and ensure that there is cotton corporation just like the board as a guide because there is no way farmers can produce cotton without government intervention.
Said he: “In America, farmers are literate and can read any template and follow the production of the cotton scientifically. Here in the North, most of the farmers are illiterate; they can't produce cotton easily without the guidance of extension officers. So government must look extensively into the area of cotton and come out with a master plan. Once there is a master plan for cotton production, they should implement the master plan. When things are put in proper perspective in cotton production, people will be happier and the textile industry will buy enough of cotton locally.”
A cotton farmer from Zamfara, Dinladi Hassan Dinladi, said farmers are no longer cultivating cotton because of low yields, lack of competitive price and market, and no improved seeds to replace the conventional ones.
According to him, since the dissolution of the Marketing Board, there has been no particular cotton market in Zamfara where farmers can take their cotton to be graded to determine the levels of the quality.
He explained: “Before the dissolution of Marketing Board, cotton used to be graded and rated A, B, C and D according to its quality. This is because any contaminated cotton will be rejected right at the spot. These are done for farmers to get value for their produce.
“Zamfara alone has about 15 ginneries and only four are working because of the lack of cotton in the market and most of these ginneries have sacked their workers. And each ginnery has the capacity to employ about 300 workers. Most of these ginneries have gone comatose and many people lost their jobs.”
He urged government to provide special intervention funds for cotton farmers, which would enable them to be committed to cotton farming and production.
A cotton farmer in Katsina, Alhaji Muhammed Jubri, said the major challenges facing cotton production in Nigeria include lack of access to credit facility, improved seeds and low price of the commodity. He said that cotton farmers are not getting returns for their hard labour and investment and blamed government for its inability to create standard cotton market, which has affected cotton production in the country, saying Nigeria's cotton used to export to countries like US, China, Pakistan and Indian.
He added: “Past and present governments are blind to the potential in cotton industry in this country. Look at what US, China are getting every year from cotton production. At the farm gate, US makes billions of dollars and it makes more when the commodity leaves farm gate. Without mincing words, Nigeria is loosing about $6.5 billion from this commodity because the demand is huge at exports market. The abandoning of cotton resulted to our textile industry in Nigeria going moribund. If cotton industry is revived, the textile industry will come alive and if the textile industry is revived, cotton production will be on the rise. You see how the two industries need each other. So government must do something about it as a matter of urgency.”
Cashew farmers earn $300m revenue in 2016
Nigeria's cashew farmers under the auspices of the National Cashew Association of Nigeria (NCAN) recorded revenue of $300 million in 2016, which represents an increase of 20 per cent from $250 million in 2015.
Speaking at the Annual Cashew Logistics meeting in Lagos recently, President of NCAN, Tola Faseru, said: “We produced about 170,000 metric tonnes this year and with what we have seen so far, 2017 is going to be better.”
According to him, in 2016, Vietnam, the world's largest cashew exporter, experienced its worst drought in a century, which reduced the country's export by 11 per cent and created market for cashew nuts from other countries.
As a result, the demand for Nigeria's cashew by foreigners increased and this pushed up the prices of local cashew nuts by 15.4 per cent.
Also speaking at the event, Publicity Secretary, NCAN, Anga Sontoye, said 2016 was a wonderful year for cashew farmers and exporters, adding that Nigerian cashew farmers would make more money in 2017 because output will increase by 10 per cent and prices are going to increase owing to lower value of naira against the dollar.
He added: “Having done our cashew survey for key producing 24 states, we realise that some cashew trees have started producing nuts and this implies that we are going to see an early crop from January and by February serious export will commence.”
However, he hinted that the price of a metric tonne of cashew in the international market sells between $1,000 and $1,200, adding that Nigeria's cashew industry will experience its greatest price regime in 2017 as the value of naira continues to drop against the dollar.
Meanwhile, Chief Executive Officer, Agri Commodity Inspection Limited, Zacheaus Egbewusi, said the demand for cashew has gone up and a lot of foreigners are calling and asking for Nigeria's cashew currently, which is why the price has gone up.
Said he: “Cashew is being sold for N450,000 per metric tonne. It was sold between N370,000 and N390,000 per metric tonne a month ago.”
Nigeria's cashew is usually harvested between February and June, though farmers stock the crop and export it all year round. The stakeholders complained about foreign traders who are moving into farmlands to purchase produce directly from farmers and called on the government to address the issue. The President lamented: “It is not done anywhere in the world, that foreigners will come into the country and source their produce directly from farms. Government at all levels need to regulate their activities,” said Faseru.
The stakeholders also requested for the grant of waivers for the importation of jute bags, which is used in packaging cashew for export.
20,000 farmers register for anchor borrower scheme in Bauchi
Over 20,000 farmers have registered for anchor borrower's scheme in Bauchi, after state government flagged off the scheme recently.
Bauchi State Governor, Mohammed Abubakar, who officially launched the scheme at Gadar-Maiwa town said his administration will give priority to programmes like the Anchor Borrowers Scheme, saying the government will, in addition to other supports, agreed to pay off the 9 per cent interest on the loan to be granted farmers in the programme.
According to him, the government has placed a high priority on agriculture, especially laudable programmes like the Anchor Borrowers Scheme, as part of efforts to empower the people, create jobs and tackle the challenges of food security in the state.
However, the lead consultant in charge of the programme in Bauchi State, Dr. Abdulmalik Nura, hinted that out of the 20,000 registered farmers, 10,000 have so far been screened by field officers and representatives of participating banks. He added that they have concluded all input assessment of irrigated rice production module for the state, which currently stood at N370,000 per hectare.
He explained: “The aim of the scheme is to create economic linkage between small holder farmers and reputable large scale processors. Each bonafide farmer is now expected to deposit N18,500, which is his mandatory 5 per cent equity contribution as prescribed by the Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP) guideline.”
Meanwhile, Bauchi Branch Controller of CBN, Musa Muhammad, said the target of the programme in the state was to create economic linkages between over 100,000 small-holder farmers and reputable large scale processors in the state.
The scheme was initiated by the Federal Government through the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) as an agricultural intervention to help farmers boost production.

Rick and Morty is partway into season 3, and we've already been blessed with cameos and PICKLE RICK. The prospect of a preview of next week's episode had us squanching when we received a YouTube notification from Not Justin Roiland (who is assuredly Justin Roiland) about a newly-uploaded video. It wasn't a season 3 clip, however. It was titled, “Rick and Morty But It's Only Mr. Meeseeks” and it's exactly what it says on the tin.
The supercut covers every scene awesome side character Mr. Meeseeks has been in so far, including season 1 episode 5 “Meeseeks and Destroy,” in which Meeseeks — who can be summoned to help someone with a task and then no longer exists once the task is completed — finds out there's one person who can't seem to be helped: Jerry. Mr. Meeseeks keeps summoning other Meeseeks to help Jerry, but he keeps failing and the Meeseeks descend into insanity as they exist far longer than they're meant to. They realize they may have to kill Jerry to return themselves to the void:
Government inability to provide amenities discourages tax payers
The Chattered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (CITN) has attributed the poor compliance of taxable Nigerians to the inability of government to make good use of taxes paid by Nigerians in the provision of basic amenities.
The body called on the Federal Government to ensure that taxes paid are used in the provision of amenities and improvement of the wellbeing of
Nigerians.
This is as Tunde Fowler, executive chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS), said that the Federal Government was doing everything to encourage Nigerians pay taxes as part of their obligation to the country.
Fowler, who was represented by Gbolaga Oshiga, the state coordinator for Enugu and Ebonyi, stated that government would ensure that the burden of payment was not high on the people, stressing that the workshop was to improve enlightenment on government's efforts, among other.
Speaking at a training workshop for professionals, on participation in the Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme
(VAIDS), organised by the federal Ministry of Finance in Enugu, Cyril Ikemefuna Ede, CITN president, said Nigerians were playing taxes before the oil boom, and that it were well utilised but that citizens lost interest in tax payments because money realised from it were no longer used for the provision of basic amenities by politicians.
It was gathered that with tax compliance of six percent, Nigeria remains the lowest in payment of taxes the world over, stressing that the development prompted the establishment of the VAIDS to sensitise Nigerians and enable them regularise their tax status. The scheme, which runs for nine months from July 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018, will
benefit tax payers who use the period to declare previously undisclosed assets and income as they are not charged interest and penalties and would be free from criminal prosecution for tax offices and audit.
“About six percent is paying tax at the moment. People are not seeing the effect of paying tax and because of that they became reluctant to pay. Again the general environment in Nigeria, when you see politicians having the whole money and these are money coming to government from taxes we pay, so some people are not being encouraged to pay. I am sure that if government turns out to do things that are good, people will start paying taxes.
“Government must make sure that the ones they pay are utilised and people have the effect of the taxes. “They pay 51 percent in Finland and people are happy to pay because they have everything they want. So, here if you pay it and government did not do anything, then they will not continue to pay,” he said.
He recalled how Nigerians were paying taxes effectively during the colonial era, “because they were seeing the effect of the payment. Each councilor was responsible to ensure that taxes were
collected and people paid freely; but when the oil money came, the whole thing slowed down and even the government was not even interested in paying tax and everybody went his way”.
Ede stated that the workshop was designed to enlighten Nigerians on the need to pay tax, stressing that lack of awareness was part of the challenge faced by the tax system in the country.
“We need continuous enlightenment, telling people the benefits because tax is an obligation. Tax payment is for government and so everybody is obliged to make contribution. It is good that everybody makes contribution according to his ability,” he said.

HARPURSVILLE, N.Y. (AP) — The long-awaited arrival of April the giraffe's baby in upstate New York has made Animal Adventure Park the second most live-viewed channel in YouTube's history.
YouTube says April's livestream had more than 232 million live views and 7.6 billion minutes of live watch time since February, second only to League of Legends eSports, which has been around since 2012.
The not-yet-named male baby giraffe was running around with its mother within three hours of birth Saturday at the private zoo in Harpursville, a village 130 miles (210 kilometers) northwest of New York City.
Animal Adventure Park owner Jordan Patch says the baby is healthy and April is recovering “perfectly.”
April and the baby will be introduced to the public when the park opens for the season next month.

These are tough times for sordid sex dramas — especially one involving coercion, deceit, and minors (oh, my!). Les Liaisons Dangereuses, last on Broadway in 2016, just barely gets away with it for being French, set hundreds of years ago, and featuring adults. Cruel Intentions, the 1999 movie that transfers the latter's ruthless plot of erotic conquest to would-be Gossip Girl Manhattan, is great fun — but also vacuous and a bit perverse.
Cruel Intentions: The Musical (aptly billed as a “musical nightlife experience”), which opened downtown last night at (Le) Poisson Rouge, solves all that with a clever and often inspired score of ‘90s pop-rock favorites, whose emo lyrics have never made more sense. (If they ever made sense at all: It's been decades since we gave up trying to decipher “Genie in a Bottle” or “Sex and Candy.”) The musical's nostalgic score actually brings the story to new heights, supplanting some of its empty cruelty with exactly the kind of soaring, confusing emotions that color teen romance.
Pop music is practically — if not explicitly — made for lending words and major chords to teenage drama of epic proportions. Co-creators Jordan Ross and Lindsey Rosin (who also directs) assemble a spot-on score of ‘90s gems that accompanied a whole generation of sexual and romantic awakenings, from the smitten passion of Sixpence None the Richer's “Kiss Me” and The Cardigans' “Lovefool” to defiant anthems from Garbage and Melissa Etheridge. Some are made into duets, others serve as earnest ballads of self-expression.
Quick primer on this prep school saga: Step-siblings Kathryn (a fierce and corseted Lauren Zakrin) and Sebastian (a built, square-jawed Constantine Rousouli) have a Cersei and Jaime Lannister thing going. Their grand scheme involves Kathryn exacting revenge on her ex, Sebastian deflowering the principal's daughter, and a wager where if Kathryn wins, she gets his Jaguar, and if Sebastian wins, he gets, well.. another kind of sweet ride involving Kathryn.
Their pawns are Sebastian's viginal conquest Annette (Carrie St. Louis, theme song: No Doubt's “I'm Just a Girl”) the naive-turned-nasty Cecile (Jessie Shelton), and her Black music teacher Ronald (Matthew Griffin) — who get together to the tune of Deep Blue Something's “Breakfast at Tiffany's.” In an expanded gay subplot, the entrapment turned romance between hipster Blaine (Spring Awakening's Alex Boniello) and football player Greg (Brian Muller) brilliantly unfolds to boy band hits “I Want it That Way” and “Bye, Bye, Bye.”
Not every number is a home run. TLC's “No Scrubs” is greeted by the same nostalgic yelps as all the others, but it doesn't land, or do much to solve the problem of Cecil's racist mother (Patricia Richardson of Home Improvement fame). When Griffin's Ronald reprises the song as a sort of clapback, it makes even less sense.
The screenplay by Roger Kumble (also one of the musical's creators) remains with its most iconic lines in tact (e.g. Cecile: “He took down my pants and started writing the alphabet, but he was writing it with his tongue.). The West Village club setting, in addition to being ideal for the young ensemble's belting talents, is a perfect homage to the movie's ‘90s Manhattan milieu. The production premiered two years ago in L.A., where it earned seals of approval from the film's stars Sarah-Michelle Gellar, Reese Witherspoon and Selma Blair. After a pop-up performance here in February, fortunately for nostalgic New Yorkers, Cruel Intentions: The Musical has come home to roost.

7mm RSAUM questions? I rarely post here but I have read almost every thread I can find and I still have some issues. I had SAC build me a new 7mm SAUM on a long action and using a proof barrel. It's throated for the 180 Berger and it shoots them lights out but I am seeing pressure signs with H8831sc with only 58.5 grains and H1000 at 61.5 grains. I am using Nosler brass necked down from 300 SAUM and I have turned the necks to .319 which is what I was told to do. The best I can do is 2750fps before pressure signs which makes no sense to me. I have checked everything I know to check and read every post I can find but not sure what is going on. I use 215 primers in all loads and I am .010 off the lands according to my OAL gauge. I have no issues closing the bolt which makes me think I am OK on the brass prep but maybe not?
I am considering switching to H4350 to see if I can get it to have some velocity. I'm sure it something simple I am missing but I figured I would ask.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Dwane Casey's 500th career game as Toronto's coach had plenty of moments to go sideways, especially after his team let a 15-point lead slip away in the first half.
DeMar DeRozan's decision to be more aggressive in the third quarter kept the Raptors on track and they extended their longest winning streak of the season.
DeRozan scored 13 of his 25 points in the third quarter and Toronto held off the Sacramento Kings 102-87 on Sunday for its sixth straight victory.
Kyle Lowry added 15 points, 12 rebounds and six assists on an off-night shooting, Serge Ibaka scored 20 points, and C.J. Miles had 11 for the Raptors. They won for the first time in Sacramento since 2014.
“That's something we've got to fight for is consistency and make sure it doesn't become a habit,” Casey said, referring to Toronto's blown early lead. “We've got to fight that. But I thought our defence carried us when we couldn't make shots.”
Toronto led by 17-2 four minutes into the first quarter, but couldn't shake the Kings until the third when DeRozan repeatedly got into the lane and to the free throw line. He also made two late baskets in the fourth after Sacramento pulled to 90-83.
DeRozan shot 9 of 15 and was 7 of 11 on free throws while going over the 12,000-point mark for his career. He went into the day six points shy of the milestone.
“Just being aggressive, picking and choosing my spots, understanding my knack of trying to get to the free throw line, when I can get to the free throw line,” DeRozan said. “That's all that was, me understanding the moment.”
That helped extend Toronto's longest winning streak of the season and ended a four-game skid against Sacramento.
Casey is the winningest coach in franchise history.
“That means you're old,” Casey said.”
The teams will meet again in Toronto next Sunday.
Zach Randolph had 19 points and 11 rebounds for the Kings, and Buddy Hield added 17 points.
Two days after an overtime road victory in New Orleans, Sacramento couldn't sustain the momentum and dug a hole with eight turnovers in the first quarter. Toronto scored the first 13 points and led 17-2 on DeRozan's short jumper four minutes into the first quarter.
Sacramento cut it to five going into the second and went ahead 29-28 on Frank Mason's two free throws with 8:06 left before the Raptors went on another run late to go up 54-46 at halftime.
The Kings cut it to 67-64 on Bogdan Bogdanovich's 3-pointer midway through the third, but Lowry scored on a three-point play, added a 16-foot baseline jumper and made two free throws to help the Raptors pull away
Sacramento committed 21 turnovers, leading to 27 points for Toronto.
“We struggled to score the basketball and our turnovers were a big Achilles heel for us,” Kings coach Dave Joerger said. “Their veterans All-Stars were terrific for them and kind of handled the game.”
ON A ROLL
The six-game winning streak matches Toronto's longest since it won 11 straight during the 2015-16 season. The Raptors had a pair of six-game streaks last season.
GOING DEEP
Jakob Poeltl made his first career 3-pointer to open the fourth quarter for the Raptors. The ninth overall pick in 2016, Poeltl hadn't even attempted a shot beyond the arc before Sunday. “That's what we do. That's our secret weapon,” Lowry said.
TIP-INS
Raptors: Lowry shot 4 of 17 and was 3 of 12 beyond the arc. . It was the first time that DeRozan won a game in Sacramento.
Kings: Hield scored 14 points in the first half on 6-of-8 shooting. … Bogdanovic started in place of George Hilll, who was out because of personal reasons. … Willie Cauley-Stein did not play because of a lingering sore back he initially hurt in Milwaukee on Dec. 2. … Sacramento had eight turnovers in the first quarter.
UP NEXT
Raptors: At the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday night.
Kings: Host Phoenix on Tuesday night.
ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — The creditors of Croatian retail and food company Agrokor have voted to approve a settlement deal that includes giving two Russian banks a more than 46-percent share in the country's biggest firm.
The vote by some 450 creditor representatives in favor of the deal was held Wednesday in a sports hall in Zagreb. Some 80 percent voted in favor of the deal that avoids bankruptcy for Agrokor, the largest company in the Balkans with 60,000 employees.
The company, which accounts for 15 percent of EU-member Croatia's GDP, collapsed under the weight of 8 billion euros ($9 billion) in debt, including a disputed sum owed to two Russian state-run banks, Sberbank and VTB.

Over the past few days, a fun if implausible rumor has spread about Kid Rock being named as a potential Republican candidate for Debbie Stabenow's Senate seat, which the Democrat has held since 2000. Judging from the headlines of local news outlets and Roll Call, you'd think Rock was seriously being considered for the roll, but alas the entire thing can be traced back to a quote by a single Tea Party operative in the state.
The Detroit Free Press first reported the story on Saturday as part of a larger article about the discussions to retake the seat at a Michigan Republican Party convention last weekend. From the Free Press:
Wes Nakagiri, a Livingston County Tea Party activist who was elected to the party's central committee Friday night, said Kid Rock, who endorsed President Donald Trump, “has named I.D., is an out-of-the-box idea, and would kind of get rid of that stodgy Republican image.” The Trump candidacy could be “a template” for a Kid Rock candidacy, and “I'll bet you he would generate as much excitement as Trump did,” Nakagiri told the Free Press.
Those quotes were picked up two days later by local affiliates for ABC and CBS, both of which went with headlines that appeared to take Nakagiri seriously: “Could Kid Rock launch a campaign to take Debbie Stabenow's Senate seat?” and “Kid Rock's Name Tossed Out For Possible Senate Run.” One day later, national politics publication Roll Call published the story with the headline “Kid Rock Eyed as Potential Senate Candidate.”
While Nakagiri is certainly active in Republican politics in Michigan—he ran for lieutenant governor in 2014, was one of the delegates from the state for the 2016 Republican National Convention, and was recently elected to the state party's central committee—it seems safe to say that Kid Rock's potential candidacy for Senate is just a rumor that, three days after it began, still hasn't been addressed by Rock's representatives.
That said, we hope he runs, if only so we can all relive the glass dildo Insane Clown Posse controversy.
Brent oil races toward $80 amid strong demand
Brent crude oil rose for a sixth day on Tuesday to hit its highest since November 2014 at over 75 dollars per barrel. This development is buoyed by expectations that supplies will tighten just as demand reaches record levels. Brent crude futures marked 75.27 dollars a barrel on Tuesday. Brent's six-day rising streak is the […]

NEW YORK — Michael Kingston has joined L'Oréal USA as chief information officer of the L'Oréal Americas Zone.
L'Oréal said he succeeds Barry Gilmore, who retired at the end of September after 17 years of IT leadership at the beauty care company.
Kingston reports to Frédéric Rozé, president and chief executive officer of L'Oréal USA, and Etienne Aubourg, CIO of the L'Oréal Group.
“We believe that Michael's diverse experience leading change and deploying strategic consumer solutions will be an important asset in driving innovation forward at L'Oréal,” stated Rozé, who's also executive vice president of the Americas Zone. “He is a progressive IT leader, and we are thrilled to add his talent to our management team.”
Before coming to L'Oréal, Kingston served in the global management consulting sector, leading digital transformation projects in key markets, the company said.
He has held several corporate leadership roles, including CIO of Neiman Marcus Group, Ann Inc., Coach Inc., LVMH and Castrol. L'Oréal noted that Kingston brings more than 20 years of IT expertise, pairing an extensive technical background with an ability to empower organizations around enterprise transformation.
The largest subsidiary of the L'Oréal Group, L'Oréal USA manages a portfolio of more than 30 beauty brands, including Garnier, Giorgio Armani Beauty, Kérastase, Lancôme, La Roche-Posay, L'Oréal Paris and Yves Saint Laurent Beauté.
L'Oréal USA also serves as the product development and marketing hub for L'Oréal's 16 U.S. brands: Baxter of California, Carol's Daughter, Clarisonic, Dermablend, Essie, IT Cosmetics, Kiehl's, Matrix, Maybelline New York, Mizani, NYX Professional Makeup, Ralph Lauren Fragrances, Redken, Softsheen-Carson, SkinCeuticals and Urban Decay.
Auburn ended its best season in nearly two decades with abundant reason for both optimism and concern.
The Tigers could return every key player next season, perhaps including centre Austin Wiley , but it's not certain that coach Bruce Pearl will join them. Auburn is still unraveling the details of a federal investigation that led to the indictment and firing of top assistant Chuck Person and entangled two players and a pair of support staffers.
Pearl's fate is unlikely to be settled before he sits down for a formal interview with attorneys conducting an internal review of his program. Neither President Steven Leath nor new athletic director Allen Greene has shed light on his job security pending that meeting.
The coach told reporters after Sunday's 84-53 loss to Clemson in the second round of the NCAA Tournament he feels his program is on “very strong footing.”
“Now we've got to finish this process with the NCAA and in my mind, as long as there are no major findings that are tied to me we'll be fine,” Pearl told reporters in San Diego. “We certainly have some other things that we're going to have to answer to and that's why you have to go through this process.”
Person allegedly accepted bribes to steer players to a financial adviser once they turned pro and funneling some of that money to the families of Wiley and Danjel Purifoy. Neither played this season.
The Tigers (26-8) have much to celebrate — and to look forward to, especially if Pearl is able to stick around. They won a share of their first Southeastern Conference regular season title since 1999 and snapped a 15-year NCAA Tournament drought, beating College of Charleston in the first round. Only the 1998-99 team won more games.
Barring early departures, every player in the regular rotation is scheduled to return from a team that set program single-season records for made free throws (647) and 3-pointers (324), along with blocked shots (180). That includes leading scorer Mustapha Heron, top 3-point shooter Bryce Brown and point guard Jared Harper .
Heron is only the fifth Auburn player to reach 1,000 points in his first two seasons. Brown, a first-team AP All-SEC guard, is 21 3-pointers shy of the Tigers' career record held by Wesley Person, Chuck's younger brother.
The NCAA has ruled that Wiley, a five-star prospect who enrolled midway through last season, is eligible to play next season. Purifoy's status remains unclear. Both could also explore entering the NBA draft.
Wiley's absence left Auburn severely undersized, especially with replacement Anfernee McLemore missing the final eight games with an ankle injury. Auburn went 3-5 down the stretch.
The uncertainty has helped leave Auburn without a commitment for the upcoming class. Five-star power forward prospect E.J. Montgomery withdrew his commitment after news of the investigation surfaced.
Pearl sounded a positive note on his program's standing after the season-ending loss.
“This is where we want our basketball program,” he said. “I have no seniors. No seniors. We're the second youngest team in the SEC behind Kentucky. I feel good about the foundation of our program.”

The company doesn't go into to too much detail about what the fingerprinting involves, but it stems from a command filtering patent. For the Super Bowl ad and other promos where Amazon already knows what's coming, Amazon will send fingerprints in advance so Alexa can compare input and ignore requests from ads. In situations where Amazon can't predict what will happen (such as a TV segment), it uses dynamic fingerprinting that looks for many simultaneous activations based on the same audio. This won't catch every false request, but it typically stops "80 to 90 percent" of devices from responding. Let's put it this way -- a funny incident shouldn't devolve into national chaos.
Amazon has another technique where it can send an inaudible signal in the 3kHz to 6kHz range to stop Alexa from responding, although that doesn't appear to be in use here.
Unfortunately, the patent suggests that other companies will have to find other ways to screen for unintended input. And that's unfortunate -- just ask anyone who's had a phone go off when a show says "OK Google" or "hey Siri." However, it's good to know that companies are just as annoyed by false responses as you are.
With a swipe of a pen Monday, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant signed into law a bill that prevents women from getting abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. His state, effective immediately, now holds the distinction of having the earliest abortion ban in the nation.
"As I have repeatedly said, I want Mississippi to be the safest place in America for an unborn child," Bryant tweeted this month in anticipation of the bill's passage. Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves echoed that sentiment Monday, tweeting "It's a great day in Mississippi" along with a picture of the signing.
Also known as the Gestational Age Act, Mississippi's new law makes exceptions only for medical emergencies or cases in which there's a "severe fetal abnormality." There are no exceptions for incidents of rape or incest.
The law also puts physicians on notice. Doctors who perform abortions after 15 weeks will be required to submit reports detailing the circumstances. If they knowingly violate the law, their medical licenses will be suspended or revoked in Mississippi. If they falsify records, they will face civil penalties or be forced to pay fines of up to $500.
The measure is just one in a string of efforts to diminish access to abortions in Mississippi, critics say.
"Abortion is a safe medical procedure and it is a critical part of the broad spectrum of reproductive health care that a woman may use in her lifetime," said Felicia Brown-Williams, Mississippi state director for Planned Parenthood Southeast Advocates, in a statement. "This ban is not only unconstitutional -- it endangers women's health care across our state. If legislators truly cared about women's health, they would be focused on ways to improve access to health care for women, not restrict it."
Access to abortions in Mississippi was already highly restrictive.
It is among a small handful of states that has one remaining clinic: in this case, Jackson Women's Health Organization. Although Mississippi is among the states with a 20-week ban, up until the enactment of this latest bill, the cutoff time for abortions at the Jackson clinic was 16 weeks. And since hospitals won't perform abortions, the resulting one-week change brought on by this new law is "arbitrary," based on "capricious whim" and a way to "feed political meat" to a political base, said Dr. Willie Parker, board chairman of Physicians for Reproductive Health.
Mississippi is the only state in the country that requires physicians who perform abortions to be board-certified or board-eligible obstetrician-gynecologists, a fact that's being challenged in court as unconstitutional by the Center for Reproductive Rights. Parker, an OB/GYN, explained that he could be trained in a plastic surgical procedure and be free to perform that procedure in Mississippi, even though he's not a board-certified plastic surgeon. But a family physician, a surgeon or an internist trained to perform abortions isn't given the same leeway.
Mississippi also requires in-person counseling and a 24-hour waiting period before receiving an abortion, which means women must make repeat trips to the facility -- a fact that's especially burdensome for those living outside Jackson. Health plans under the Affordable Care Act, insurance policies for public employees and public funding for abortions can be applied only in cases of rape, incest, fetal impairment or when a life is endangered, according to the Guttmacher Institute.
About 2,000 women a year in Mississippi receive abortions, Parker said. The vast majority, 88%, receive them in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. So by 15 weeks, he estimates, 200 women in Mississippi who should have access to an abortion no longer will.
For women living in poverty who need time to gather resources to pay for an abortion and for those outside Jackson who need to find ways to cover additional expenses associated with travel, House Bill 1510 will close the door to a procedure that's been a legal right for women since the passage of Roe v. Wade in 1973.
Proponents of the bill, like Mississippi State Rep. Dan Eubanks, argue that this law will do what's best for women.
"Beyond the obvious debate of trying to save the lives of innocent babies, there is the often less discussed issues that relates to the health of the mother who receives an abortion," Eubanks wrote in an email. "When did looking out for the life, health and overall wellbeing of a child or its mother start getting labeled as extreme in this country?"
Eubanks says that the longer a woman carries a child in her womb, "the greater the potential she will suffer from psychological, emotional, and physical damages as an outcome," though that contention is generally disputed by those who advocate for safe access to abortions.
The new Mississippi law is expected to be challenged in court.
The Center for Reproductive Rights points out that similar efforts in other states -- Arizona, North Dakota and Arkansas -- were shot down on constitutional grounds. And the advocacy group expects that this bill to ban "pre-viability abortion" will similarly be stopped.
"Mississippi politicians' flagrant assault on reproductive rights will not go unchallenged," said Lourdes Rivera, senior vice president of US programs at the Center for Reproductive Rights, in a written statement. "This bill is dangerous and unconstitutional. The Center is prepared to answer any attempt to undermine 40 years of Supreme Court precedent with the full force of the law."
LAKE FOREST A years-long attempt to turn an old nursery into a U-Haul rental and storage center took another step in the right direction after the Planning Commission approved updated plans for the design and landscaping for the project on Thursday, June 8.
The facility, at 25290 Jeronimo Road, would be the third for U-Haul in Lake Forest, but the first that offers a storage facility, according to city staff.
The facility would include a three-story, 120,172-square-foot self-storage building and a 5,350-square foot general warehouse building, which will include the rental of trucks and equipment from the site, new parking stalls, a rental truck parking area, an equipment and truck display parking area and additional landscaping, according to a staff report.
This is the second time the Planning Commission has voted in favor of the U-Haul project. The first approval occurred in June 2013 despite objections from some residents and city staffers.
However, the City Council reviewed the item in August and voted, 4-1, to deny the use permit and asked U-Haul to instead redesign the architecture of the building to match others in what is considered the city's Light Industrial Area and submit the revised plans to the Planning Division.
Some residents still came with concerns on June 8. Residents in Bennett Ranch, the neighborhood across Jeronimo from the projected site, said the facility would bring increased traffic, would worsen the already crowded parking situation in the neighborhood, and would attract day-laborers.
Residents said they were happy the city was considering doing something with the old nursery site, but said they didn't believe the rental facility was the right solution.
“We have enough problems in Bennett Ranch due to parking in the area, picking up trash and noise,” resident Joe Jaskowiak told the commission. “The three-story building for rental and storage will only add to these problems. It will cause greater traffic problems because more people will try to park on the street for these facilities.”
Resident Vincent Burke took issue with the number of trucks the company would display in the parking lot adjacent to the street.
“They keep saying they need the trucks out there so people can see what's available,” he said. “When I rent, I read Yellow Pages or go online to see what they have available. All they need is one vehicle of relative size on a platform either on the corner or near the entrance. The rest of the vehicles can be moved further back.”
Burke also requested fencing to be put around the facility to discourage day-laborers, but property owner Jim Lorimer said adding fencing would do the opposite. Lorimer said day-laborers would sit on the fencing or use it to chain bicycles or hang lunch pales.
“Having no fence gives no place for day laborers to sit, you promote the day laborers by having a fence and if they start stepping all over my landscaping, we'll have a bigger issue,” Lorimer said.
The commission also asked Lorimer about the possibility of increasing the number of rental trucks at the new facility. Lorimer said there is no plan to bring additional vehicles and the company has tools and means to transport trucks to other facilities if need be.
“We don't do rentals based on the size of the facility, but the demand of the community,” he said.
The Planning Commission held a public hearing regarding the facility, May 11, but decided to continue the item in June to allow Lorimer to make changes to the landscaping along Jeronimo Road and Orange Avenue.
Plans submitted for the June meeting included revised landscape elements including a new three-foot tall hedge of Thundercloud between all parking areas and street frontage, and a double row hedge of Regal Mist Pink Muhly, a pink ornamental grass, to be used as a groundcover along the street front.
“With the landscaping, this is an excellent choice with what they've got there,” Commissioner Dave Carter said. “The color scheme is going to be breathtaking….The vehicles will be the least visible of the bunch.”
The project may or may not be reviewed by Lake Forest City Council, depending on whether a council
Glo signs deal with Huawei for another submarine cable
Mobile giant Globacom is to build another multi-billion naira optic fibre submarine cable, which is expected to boost telecom services in Nigeria and the West African sub-region.
The contract for Glo 2 was signed yesterday between Globacom and Huawei at Eko Hotel and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos.
Globacom's Regional Director, Technical, Mr. Sanjib Roy said the submarine cable would be built from Glo 1 landing station, Alpha Beach in Lagos. It will run along the coast to the southern part of Nigeria, he said, adding that it will provide capacity to offshore oil platforms and the communities as well as facilitate ultra-high capacity connection to the Southsouth and provide capacity to offshore oil platforms and the communities.
“Glo2 will be the first submarine cable in Nigeria to land outside Lagos as the five existing submarine cables only landed in Lagos. Glo 2 will have capacity of 12Terabit per second and will provide ultra-high speed connection to oil platforms and communities to empower data coverage and support Enterprise market growth in this part of Nigeria,” Mr. Roy said.
Glo 2 is expected to provide high speed internet connectivity, thus supporting the oil platforms to improve productivity by uploading data to remote oil platforms at the speed of light. Besides, it will provide economic as well as social empowerment for the communities in oil producing regions through a unique telecommunication service delivery.
According to him, Glo 2 is coming on board to support the growth of “Nigerian economy and allow oil communities reduce their operational expenditure by providing the first submarine optical fiber dedicated to oil platforms. “It is also designed for further expansion southwards to Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Angola, among others,” Roy added.
“The New submarine cable will be approximately 850 kilometres long and will be named Glo2. The cable will be integrated to Globacom's existing terrestrial Backbone Network to provide additional service redundancy, especially Abuja and other parts of the country.”
The cable will be divided into three pairs, with the first pair connecting Lagos directly to the Southern part of Nigeria while for redundancy and maintenance purposes it will also be connected to other parts of the country. The second pair will deliver high capacity to offshore oil stations and communities connected directly to Bus and will be equipped with eight switchable Branching Units. The third pair will deliver high capacity to Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea and will be equipped with two switchable Branching Units.
Glo2 will support the Glo 1 international submarine cable built by Globacom in 2010. Glo 1, managed exclusively from Lagos to London, provides sufficient bandwidth for the West Africa sub-region. It is the only international submarine cable in Nigeria.
Huawei Nigeria Managing Director Mr. Li Beifang said: “Huawei is proud to partner with Globacom to build a revolutionary submarine cable, using innovative and leading technology. We believe the cable would bring a new era of digitalisation to Nigerian economy.”

CLEARWATER, Fla. (WFLA) – A pedestrian was injured in an accident in Clearwater Monday afternoon.
The vehicle versus pedestrian accident occurred at State Road 580 and McMullen Booth Road.
The adult woman was flown from the scene by medical helicopter.
Clearwater police say to expect traffic delays and to avoid the area.
The westbound lanes of State Road 580 at the intersection are mostly affected.
As you might guess, this is intended for servers where capacity takes priority over everything else, including performance (the 500MB/sec is nothing to write home about). A data center could hold 100 petabytes of data in a single rack instead of needing large swaths of server room space. That's helpful for cloud services, AI and other technologies that may need massive amounts of data.
And then there's the cost. When the DC100 ships in the summer, it'll have pricing comparable to other business-grade SSDs "on a per-terabyte basis." That likely means a price in the tens of thousands of dollars, which is enough to give pause even to those companies that can afford it. While the drive should be trustworthy enough, that's a lot of money (and a lot of data) to lose if one goes bad. Think of this more as a peek at the future of SSDs than anything else.

A man was taken to hospital for treatment following disorder on a Sunderland housing estate.
A 29-year-old was taken to hospital after an incident in Thorndale Road, Thorney Close, at 9pm yesterday.
Northumbria Police have not said what injuries he sustained, but said he was later discharged from hospital.
A 36-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of assault.
He remains in custody today as inquiries continue.
Anyone with information which can help the investigation can contact police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
President Edgar Lungu has complained that some of his ministers and permanent secretaries are now failing to discharge their duties for fear of being labeled corrupt, saying he “cannot take it anymore.”
Speaking when he swore in some State House officials and diplomats at State House yesterday, President Lungu challenged Roan MP Chishimba Kambwili and others to provide evidence of their corruption claims.
“I cannot take it anymore, some of my ministers and permanent secretaries are now paralyzed on account of corruption allegations. ‘You are corrupt, you are corrupt ,you are corrupt', come on, give us the evidence and the courts will deal with it,” President Lungu said.
President Lungu maintained that he will not fire anyone especially regarding the procurement of the 42 fire engines unless the whistle blowers prove their corruption allegation accompanied with evidence.
“Especially in the aftermath of the much talked about fire tenders, people have being telling me to drop some one or two even four guys to kill this but I do not fire anybody, transfer anybody or promote anybody like that but on merit,” said President Lungu.
He urged his ministers and permanent secretaries not to be intimidated but continue working as long as they were not involved in illegal dealings.
And in apparent reference to Kambwili, President Lungu said he was disappointed that the ACC has so far not given him feedback on their investigations, which he allowed after receiving information from the institution on one of his ministers.
The Head of State swore in Anthony Mukwita as Ambassador to Germany, Alfridah Kansembe as Ambassador to Brazil, Dr Ngosa Simbyakula as Zambia's Ambassador to the United States of America and retired Major General Toplyn Lubaya as Zambia's Ambassador to Egypt.
Others sworn in were Dr Simon Miti as principle private secretary at State House, Patrick Kangwa as Deputy Secretary to the Cabinet for Administration, Mabvuto Sakala as higher education permanent secretary and Yande Mwape as National Coordinator for DMMU.
MRC has compiled video that shows what the liberal mainstream media didn't want its viewers to see from last weekend's #ProtestPP march in Washington, D.C. ( Reuters photo )
The liberal mainstream media may have finally begun reporting on the nationwide protests against Planned Parenthood, but as the Media Research Center has pointed out, there's a long way to go.
During the #ProtestPP event held last weekend in Washington, D.C., counterprotesters representing the abortion giant engaged in all sorts of vile behavior. But at several points, they became physically violent and had to be pushed back by police.
None of that ever made the evening news, now did it?
MRC, however, has compiled several different videos that show what the news cameras didn't—or wouldn't. Fair warning, the language directed at both the pro-life activists and the police goes well beyond vulgar. Click here to see the clips.
The MRC report states:
While ABC and CBS displayed footage from the Washington, D.C. rally, they still didn't show the struggle between police and Planned Parenthood activists.
During the CBS Weekend News Saturday evening, anchor Reena Ninan introduced the segment on "demonstrations on both sides of the Planned Parenthood funding debate." Correspondent Tony Dokoupil continued the report on "dueling rallies" between supporters of abortion and the "opposition to a woman's right to abortion" or "abortion-rights opponents."
"The bulk of what Planned Parenthood does at clinics like this one all across the country is provided basic health care, but, Reena," he defended in his conclusion, "demonstrators say they won't stop until the number of abortions the group provides falls to zero." CBS Sunday Morning also mentioned the protests, without showing any conflict.
During ABC's Good Morning America on Feb. 12, reporter Ron Claiborne also noted the "demonstrations on both sides of the abortion issue," and included (peaceful) footage from Washington, D.C.
Besides ABC and CBS, NBC Nightly News anchor Jose Diaz-Balart also noted that "thousands showed up for protests and counter-protests" on Feb. 11. Correspondent Morgan Radford continued the segment on "anti-abortion demonstrators" versus the "abortion-rights activists." On Feb. 12, during Today, there was also a brief reference to protests against "repealing Obamacare and abortion rights."
Like ABC and CBS, NBC didn't even hint at the conflict between police and Planned Parenthood supporters.

U.S. President Donald Trump listens during a meeting with teachers and parents on education at the White House in Washington, U.S., February 14, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque -
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump assailed U.S. intelligence agencies on Wednesday for what he said were illegal information leaks, and dismissed reports of contacts between members of his presidential campaign and Russian intelligence officials.
Trump went on the counter-offensive as his administration reeled from the abrupt dismissal of Michael Flynn as national security adviser on Monday.
The New York Times reported late on Tuesday that phone call records and intercepted calls showed members of Trump's presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the Nov. 8 election.
Trump dismissed the report, firing back in a series of early morning tweets on Wednesday.
"This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign," the Republican president tweeted, citing his former Democratic rival in the 2016 presidential contest.
In another tweet, Trump said: "Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia," adding that the situation was "very serious."
"The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by "intelligence" like candy. Very un-American!" Trump wrote.
He did not give evidence to back his charge that intelligence officials were supplying information to the news media. He did not say if he had ordered any investigation into leaks.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the Times report, which the Kremlin dismissed on Wednesday.
CNN also reported that Trump advisers were in constant contact with Russian officials during the campaign.
INTERCEPTED COMMUNICATIONS
The Times, citing current and former U.S. officials, said U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies intercepted the communications around the same time they discovered Russia was trying to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee.
The officials had seen no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians on the hacking or other efforts to influence the election, the Times said, but they were still alarmed by the intercepted communications.
Flynn was forced out over conversations he had with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office on Jan. 20, and his misrepresentations to Vice President Mike Pence over what he had discussed.
The Times said the intercepted calls in its report were different from the wiretapped conversations between Flynn and the ambassador, Sergei Kislyak.
U.S. lawmakers, including some leading Republicans, called on Tuesday for a deeper inquiry into not just Flynn's actions but broader White House ties to Russia. Trump has long said that he would like improved relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Flynn's conversations with the Russian ambassador took place around the time that then-President Barack Obama imposed new sanctions on Russia on Dec. 29, charging that Moscow had used cyberattacks to try to influence the presidential election in Trump's favor.
A U.S. official familiar with the transcripts of the calls with the ambassador said Flynn indicated that if Russia did not retaliate, that could smooth the way toward a broader discussion of improving U.S.-Russian relations once Trump took power.
This was potentially illegal under a law barring unauthorized private citizens from interfering in disputes the United States has with other countries.

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — It can start with a couple of traffic tickets. Unable to pay the tickets right away, a driver becomes saddled with late fees, fines and court costs. Soon, the driver may be taken off the road indefinitely. More than 40 states allow the suspension of driver's licenses for people with unpaid criminal or traffic court debt. But now, advocates across the country are pushing to change that, arguing that such laws are unconstitutional because they unfairly punish poor people and violate due process by not giving drivers notice or an opportunity to show they cannot afford to pay the fees. Lawsuits have been filed in at least five states over the past two years.
“It's not that I don't want to take care of what I owe. I really wish I could,” said Brianna Morgan, a single mother from Petersburg, Virginia, who hasn't had a license in three years because she owes more than $400 in traffic fines and court costs from traffic violations and a disorderly conduct citation. “I really don't have a way to pay it,” said Morgan, who supports herself and her three children on a monthly disability check.
Advocates had a victory this week in Tennessee, where a federal judge ruled that a law that allows the state to revoke the licenses of low-income people with unpaid court debt from past criminal convictions is unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger called the law “powerfully counterproductive” and ordered Tennessee to stop revoking licenses and to reinstate the licenses of people who had theirs revoked due solely to nonpayment of court fees. “If a person has no resources to pay a debt, he cannot be threatened or cajoled into paying it; he may, however, become able to pay it in the future. But taking his driver's license away sabotages that prospect,” Trauger wrote in her ruling Monday.
In Virginia, nearly a million people currently have suspended driver's licenses at least in part because of unpaid court debt, according to the Legal Aid Justice Center, a nonprofit that is challenging the practice in a federal lawsuit. A judge dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds, but in a ruling in May, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals gave the case new life, sending it back to the lower court to allow the plaintiffs to revise the lawsuit.
Millions of drivers nationwide have lost licenses because of such laws. In a study released in September, the justice center estimated that 4.2 million people then had suspended or revoked licenses for unpaid court debt in five states alone: Virginia, Tennessee, Michigan, North Carolina and Texas.
Lawsuits are pending in North Carolina, Montana and Michigan, in addition to Virginia and Tennessee. In California, legislation enacted last year prohibits state courts from suspending driver's licenses simply because of unpaid traffic fines.
But supporters of the laws say people who violate traffic laws must be held accountable.
Virginia Republican state Sen. Bill Carrico said the threat of losing a license can provide incentive to pay fines.
“If we don't suspend driver's licenses, then people will say, 'I'm not going to pay the fine,'” Carrico said. “That's a slippery slope.”
A separate lawsuit still pending in Tennessee challenges a law that allows the state to take away the driver's licenses of people with unpaid traffic debt.
For Ashley Sprague, a 27-year-old mother of five from Lebanon, Tennessee, who is a plaintiff in that case, the thought of paying $946 in traffic debt, plus $388 to get her license reinstated, was overwhelming.
Her debt began in 2015 after she got a citation for speeding and failure to have proof of insurance. At the time, she made $2.13 an hour, plus tips, as a waitress at Waffle House.
Sprague said she couldn't afford to pay and lost two jobs while her license was suspended because she had to rely on other people to get to work.
In the Virginia case, Judge Roger Gregory, chief justice of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, wrote that the state's system does not differentiate between those unable to pay from those unwilling to pay.
“By suspending the licenses of those who cannot pay for reasons outside of their control, the state traps thousands of Virginians in a nightmarish spiral for which there is no apparent exit,” Gregory wrote.
But Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School, said he thinks it's unlikely the lawsuits will succeed in getting other states to stop suspending licenses for nonpayment of fees.
“There's no question that suspension for failure to pay a fine is the hardest on those who cannot pay the fine, but courts will be concerned about the slippery slope narrative,” Turley said.
“If there is a constitutional barrier to the suspension of licenses for failure to pay a fine, where does that right begin and end? Does that apply to all permits and licenses?”
We're partnering FG to boost ports investment –Andrew Dawes, CEO, Intels Nigeria Limited
From Uche Usim, Abuja
Before his appointment as the Chief Executive Officer of Intels Nigeria Limited, Andrew Dawes was the Managing Director of Lagos-based AP Moller Terminal.
A stickler for excellence, Dawes has extensive experience in a wide range of terminal operations and logistics having worked with several global terminal operators over a period of 20 years.
He is also well grounded in port operations and logistics, having held senior management positions and developed expertise in management and port operations with different organisations in North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa.
Recently, the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Mrs. Hadiza Usman, visited Intels' Onne office where Dawes reeled out a lot of investment plans the company has as it partners the Federal Government to boost port investment programme.
He shares some of those plans with Daily Sun.
Excerpts:
Allegation of monopoly tendencies
The question I received was that Intels is operating a monopoly and we have several times issued out a statement to the press to people accusing us of this.
Intels is investing billions of dollars in infrastructure on behalf of the NPA. We are partners with the public private sector, so our policy is to invest in concessioned terminals, which were issued under the concession agreement of the NPA, the Transport Minister, in line with the government strategy for infrastructure investment in the country. We do not issue oil and gas certificates to all the oil and gas terminals.
However, we do pay comparatively far more money to the government than any other private jetty. Private jetties partner the Federal Government to bring on the capacity when required. It's about building infrastructure strategy for the country and it doesn't matter if it was on gas, you can use the same example of containerisation. Container terminals that have concessions pay very high fees to the government and they have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure and equipment specialised in handling such type of cargo. That is exactly what we have done in the oil and gas sector. If a private person would come into the oil and gas sector and put in zero investment, zero employment to the government, that would be unfair to Nigeria, unfair to the port authority of Nigeria and wouldn't allow the infrastructure capacity to grow as required by the country.
Investment outlay in 2016
We have invested billions of US dollars in infrastructure and still investing. I cannot specifically give you figures now of what we've invested this year.
Challenges
The challenges we face are same with the challenges Nigeria is facing. The oil and gas prices have fallen to historic low at the last 10 years; cargo is down 70 per cent on several years ago but we are here, we are investing in infrastructure for a long term, we are not investing for this year, we are investing for a long term and we will partner the Federal Government for a longer term.
Phase 4B project
Phase 4B project is the only facility ready to receive a full Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) alongside. We have invested along with the Federal Government in partnership with building infrastructure with a total of 4km of key length, ready to take the biggest ships alongside.
Pulling investments in time of recession
During this period, our investment pace would slow down. We have enough capacity here in this facility to see the oil and gas growth not only back to where it was in 2014 but also through many years of growth and we will partner the Federal Government to ensure that the capacity we brought on are the right quality, quantity and at the right time. And that's why it's clear that the Federal Government controls the policy of port allocation and no one else; not the private sector.
Future projects
We will just want to see us partnering and becoming closer with the oil and gas sector as we have been in the last 25 to 30 years. That's three decades of partnering and we will look to bring on capacity and expertise long into the future with Nigeria.
Badagry deep seaport
Badagry port project is progressing and we are very excited about it along with our partners, APM Terminals. It'll be the largest port in Africa with the largest draft. It'll be a mega port for the largest economy in Africa with the largest population and we believe it will be the best growth potential of a long time.
About Intels
Intels Nigeria Limited was established 30 years ago with the vision to develop an integrated logistics solution offering a complete package of facilities and services to the oil and gas industry in Nigeria.
Intels Nigeria, working in conjunction with Intels West Africa (Intels), has become a leading supplier of oil and gas logistic support services throughout West Africa and particularly Nigeria. First in Nigeria and then in other countries, Intels has pioneered the concept of the integrated ‘one-stop-shop' oil service centre bringing together terminal operations, logistics plus transit and supply services.
To complete the range of services available at the oil service centres, and to offer a more complete logistics package, Intels also provides dedicated manpower and equipment hire, secure residential housing and commercial office areas. This benefits the operators by allowing them to concentrate on their core business rather than invest time and resources in peripheral activities.
Intels Nigeria Limited's mission is to promote the development of the Nigerian economy via the oil and gas industry by addressing its core competences to fulfilling the corporate market's outsourced logistics needs.
Intels Nigeria Limited's vision is to offer tailor-made logistics solutions to the Nigerian oil and gas Iindustry by leading the industry as a core services provider through its skill, efficiency, integrity and quality of service.
The vision is to also commercially utilise the opportunities derived from its expertise in logistics management and applying the “one-stop-shop” solution to its provision of serviced commercial ports and port infrastructure to optimise profitability and facilitating engagement with, and sustained development of communities and maintaining a healthy and cooperative partnership with government.

Richmond FBI to host second annual Youth Academy
| By
RICHMOND, Va. (AP) – The Richmond division of the FBI will host its second annual Youth Academy this summer to give teens a comprehensive look at today's FBI. The two-day program will be held in July at the FBI's Richmond field office. Students may be offered case studies drawn from resolved cases, but will not be exposed to active cases or day-to-day investigations. The program is open to Virginia high school students who are juniors or seniors during the 2018-2019 academic year. Students interesting in participating must have parental approval and maintain a grade point average of 2.5 or higher. The deadline to apply is May 7.
The University of Chicago will soon host a workshop on how to avoid the “negative ramifications” of contacting law enforcement by teaching students “alternatives to calling the police.”
During a workshop scheduled for February 22, explicitly titled “Alternatives to Calling the Police,” the prestigious school's “Students Working Against Prisons” club will discuss “the negative ramifications of calling the police, especially in regards to their racial oppression of black people and other people of color.”
“There will be a guided brainstorming of alternatives to calling the police.”
[RELATED: UW students make profit off of anti-police hoodies]
“It will then prompt participants to reflect on their own relationship to the police,” a description for the event explains, noting that the workshop will conclude with a “guided brainstorming of alternatives to calling the police.”
According to an advertisement for the event, students will consider alternatives to law enforcement officials in cases of “mugging,” “sexual assault,” “health emergencies,” “mental health crises,” and “public nuisances,” or “‘suspicious' activity.”
Campus Reform contacted the group hosting the event for clarification on what precisely the alternatives to calling police would look like in each of those scenarios, but did not receive a response in time for publication.

Notably, Students Working Against Prisons was founded to protest the university's ties to the food corporation “Bon Appétit,” a subsidiary of “Compass Group,” which the group describes as “the largest contract foodservice company in the world, and one that of course has a long history of involvement in prisons.”
The group goes on to explain that its objection to the Compass Group stems from the fact that it provides food to roughly 300,000 inmates at prisons across the country.
“Our goals are to educate U Chicago students about the prison-industrial complex, offer solidarity and support to prisoners, and end U Chicago's ties to prisons,” the student group states.

President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo
President Nana Akufo-Addo has revealed that government is instituting measures to have more exports to the United States (US) under the Africa Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA) to achieve a target of $500million in 2020.
Mr. Akufo-Addo, who was speaking at the Second National Policy Summit in Accra on Monday, August 14 said, “Ghana's total non-exports under AGOA for 2016 was $12 million and we aim to increase our export volumes under AGOA to $500million in 2020.”
According to Mr. Akufo-Addo, the AGOA Act was signed into law some 17 years ago and two years after the extension, to another decade. “Ghana has not extensively exploited this opportunity and accordingly not realized any significant gain,” he said.
In view of this, he indicated government is working to ensure measures are implemented for Ghanaians to take full advantage of the US market through the AGOA initiative.
He said government is in the process of finalizing a new AGOA Export Strategy and Export Plan to that effect, to boost the non-traditional exports.
This, he believes, falls in line with government's initiative to boost the economy and create numerous jobs for Ghanaians.
Stocks are rallying Monday morning as the tensions between the U.S. and North Korea that flared last week appeared to ease. Technology companies and banks are making some of the largest gains as stocks bounce back from their losses with some of the biggest gains the market has seen this year. All 11 industrial groups in the Standard & Poor's 500 index are moving higher.
KEEPING SCORE: The S&P 500 jumped 24 points, or 1 percent, to 2,466 as of 11:15 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 147 points, or 0.7 percent, to 22,005. The Nasdaq composite added 73 points, or 1.2 percent, to 6,329. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies climbed 14 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,388.
Last week was the worst for stocks since late March, as the S&P 500 fell more than 1.4 percent. Rising tensions between the U.S. and North Korea startled investors out of the complacency that has weighed on the stock market for most of this year. That eased Monday after officials said fighting is not imminent. The top U.S. military officer said the country wants to resolve the standoff peacefully.
Thursday was the worst day for stocks since mid-May, and Monday is shaping up to be the best day since late April.
LEADERS: Technology stocks rose in early trading. Apple added $1.88, or 1.2 percent, to $159.36 and Microsoft picked up $1.07, or 1.5 percent, to $73.57. Western Digital advanced $2.77, or 3.5 percent, to $82.67.
Chipmaker Nvidia rebounded after two days of sharp losses. It rose $6.32, or 4.1 percent, to $162.28. Competitors like Micron Technology and Analog Devices also rose.
NEW BUYER NETS NEFF: Equipment rental company Neff said it received a buyout offer worth $25 per share, or $596 million. It did not say who made the offer, but Neff said its board has decided the new offer is superior to a bid from H&E Equipment Services that the company accepted last month. H&E Equipment has the right to match the new offer and is entitled to a breakup payment if Neff it acquired by another company. Neff climbed $3.85, or 17.6 percent, to $25.70. H&E's offer valued Neff at $21.07 a share.
H&E Equipment lost 48 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $21.11.
FRIENDLY NABORS: Drilling technology developer Tesco said it will be acquired by drilling contractor Nabors Industries in an all-stock deal. The companies said Tesco is being valued at $4.62 a share. Tesco added 43 cents, or 10.9 percent, to $4.33. Nabors lost 33 cents, or 4.8 percent, to $6.48.
STICKER SHOCK? Fiat Chrysler climbed after Automotive News reported that a Chinese carmaker offered to buy the company. It did not identify that company and said Fiat Chrysler rejected the offer because it wasn't high enough, but investors hoped another bid would come. Fiat Chrysler stock gained 88 cents, or 7.6 percent, to $12.50.
RHIMES AND REASON: Netflix signed a deal with Shonda Rhimes, the creator of popular television series such as "Scandal" and "Grey's Anatomy." She will leave ABC and make shows for Netflix, although those shows will remain on ABC. Financial terms were not disclosed, but recently Netflix has started shelling out more money to try to get own and develop shows that more people will watch. Its stock dipped 23 cents to $171.17 Monday.
ENERGY: U.S. crude oil rose 18 cents to $49 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, picked up 11 cents to $52.21 a barrel in London.
BONDS: Bond prices turned lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.21 percent from 2.19 percent late Friday. That helped banks, as higher bond yields mean higher interest rates and greater profits on mortgages and other loans.
Bank of America climbed 48 cents, or 2 percent, to $24.35 and JPMorgan Chase gained $1.21, or 1.3 percent, to $92.63.
CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 109.45 yen from 109.04 yen. The euro fell to $1.1785 from $1.1824.
OVERSEAS: Germany's DAX jumped 1.4 percent, as did the CAC 40 in France. In Britain, the FTSE 100 index added 0.8 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index jumped 1.4 percent and the South Korean Kospi rose 0.6 percent. Japanese stocks fell sharply as investors played catch-up after an extended holiday weekend. The Nikkei ended 1 percent lower.

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) – Richmond officials have paid more than $138,000 to the Washington Redskins for the privilege of hosting the NFL team's training camp this year.The annual payment by the Richmond Economic Development Authority is on top of the $11 million that the authority and the city spent to build the team's training facility.The team requires Richmond to contribute $500,000 a year to defray some of the costs associated with practicing about 115 miles south of the Redskins' regular facility in Ashburn. Richmond officials hoped the contribution to be covered by sponsorships and other services including meals and transportation.The payment is lower than in past years, and officials with the authority tell The Richmond Times-Dispatch that they hope to continue reducing the amount they have to give the team.
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) — An Ohio man accused of plowing his car into counter-protesters at a white nationalist rally in Virginia is set to make his first court appearance.
Col. Martin Kumer, superintendent at the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail, says 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. has a bond hearing Monday morning.
Fields is charged with second-degree murder and other counts after authorities say he drove into the crowd, fatally injuring one woman and hurting 19 others.
Fields has been in custody since Saturday. Jail officials told The Associated Press they don't know if he's obtained an attorney.
A high school teacher said Fields was fascinated with Nazism, idolized Adolf Hitler and had been singled out by school officials in the 9th grade for his “deeply held, radical” convictions on race.

>> BACK TO TOP STORIES
Michael Danielewicz, P2 Energy Solutions' Senior Vice President and Canadian General Manager, sat down with us to answer a few questions about Qbyte All Access. QAA provides a new way for Canadian oil and gas operators to leverage the industry-leading Qbyte software applications.
What exactly is QAA?
QAA is our new, all-in-one software package that includes land, accounting, AFE management, production accounting, and all the associated reporting capabilities – the ERP for an oil and gas company. When an oil and gas organization is just getting going, they have a lot to worry about. The last thing they want to be doing is second-guessing their systems and whether they're giving their employees everything they need to perform at the highest level possible. So that's why we created the QAA bundle, because it allows startups to get up and running quickly and focus on what matters most to them – running and growing their business.
You said “up and running quickly.” How quickly are we talking about?
Days. The P2 Cloud and Qbyte QuickStart – that's how we do it. Because QAA is hosted in the P2 Cloud and because we use our templated setup with years of industry best practices built into it, we can have an environment set up in a matter of days. Not only is this approach fast, but it also keeps implementation costs to a minimum with the implementation focusing on how to use the applications efficiently. If the organization happens to be in the process of acquiring properties, we're able to have the seller's data converted and ready for use quickly, too.
So why now? Why did your team decide to develop QAA?
It's all part of adjusting to the new industry normal of lower commodity prices and the need to for operators to do more with less. Today, deals happen so fast. So does the transition to operatorship. Regardless of the situation, producers are keeping a very, very close eye on costs because margins are so tight right now. As I mentioned earlier, leveraging the P2 Cloud-Qbyte QuickStart combination, we're able to accelerate companies' time to value. Not only that, but operators get an unlimited number of users with QAA, so we're able to deliver additional value to them in that way.
And why QAA? Aren't there other software packages that are great for oil and gas companies that are just getting started?
The solutions that make up QAA – Qbyte CS Land, Qbyte Financial Management, Qbyte AFE Qbyte Metrix (for production accounting), and Qbyte Optix (for reporting) – are industry-leading applications and very easy to use. Eighty percent of Canada's top 50 companies use at least one Qbyte product. In total, we have more than 340 Canadian oil and gas customers. The Qbyte solutions are bulletproof, purpose-built, trusted, and they lead the way in terms of complete functionality. Organizations that use Qbyte are in very good company.
Do these solutions just live on their own then?
No, they're integrated. QAA includes cross-product reporting capabilities, master file integration, and transactional integration. The systems all work together, which means users are able to save time on important tasks, reduce errors and rework, and preserve the integrity of their data.
We've talked a lot about small startups. What if a startup using QAA wants to grow?
With QAA, a company can grow as much as they want. That's the great thing about the software – we have one version of code. So whether the company is small and just getting started or large and established, they get the same set of capabilities. Companies of all sizes implement Qbyte, grow with it, and never worry about having to change systems – that's probably the best part about the software.
How is QAA priced?
It's super simple – the monthly fee is based on the company's BOE/d and as I said earlier, every QAA customer gets an unlimited number of users.
Where can someone go to learn more about QAA?

The New England Patriots are the clear-cut favorites to win the Super Bowl heading into the playoffs, but bettors have been siding with the Green Bay Packers all season.
The Patriots are listed at 7-5 to win the Super Bowl at the Westgate SuperBook, followed by the Dallas Cowboys at 7-2. The Pittsburgh Steelers and Packers are each 8-1.
Despite an up-and-down season, more bets have been placed on the Packers to win the Super Bowl than any other team at multiple Las Vegas sportsbooks. Green Bay hosts the New York Giants on Sunday in the wild-card round.
The Packers opened at 10-1 to win Super Bowl LI and saw their odds drift all the way to 80-1 after a midseason four-game losing streak. But Green Bay closed out the regular season with six straight wins, including Sunday's 31-24 victory over the Detroit Lions that clinched the NFC North division title and a playoff game at Lambeau Field.
While Aaron Rodgers and the Packers have attracted the most bets, the larger action has been on Tom Brady and the Patriots. More money has been bet on New England to win the Super Bowl than any other team at multiple books.
Among the playoff teams, the Patriots have attracted 30 percent of the money bet on William Hill's odds to win the Super Bowl, including a $40,000 bet at 170 and a $30,000 bet at 250 that were placed in December. Those bets would net $68,000 and $75,000 respectively, if Brady leads New England to a fifth Super Bowl title.
The Kansas City Chiefs and Atlanta Falcons are each 10-1, followed by the Seattle Seahawks at 12-1 and Giants at 20-1. The Houston Texans, Miami Dolphins and Oakland Raiders are each 80-1, and the Lions, at 100-1, are the biggest Super Bowl long shots among the playoff teams at the SuperBook.

The legal battle between Taylor Swift and former Denver Country radio DJ, David Mueller is coming to close as the judge heard closing arguments from both parties today.

“That's not the type of guy who grabs or gropes a superstar, apparently out of the blue,” Mueller's attorney Gabriel McFarland said.
“Ms. Swift's story never changed. Ever. For four years,” Swift's attorney Douglas Baldridge said. “Will aggressors like David Mueller be allowed to victimize their victims?” he asked the jurors.
Baldridge then asked the jury to “return a verdict for a single dollar, a single symbolic dollar, the value of which is immeasurable to all women in this situation.”
The case is now with the jury.

Modern-day rap can feel like a persistent, ever-present storm front, ready to deluge its audience at anytime with a nonstop torrent of new music. It can be overwhelming. Where once upon a time, listeners had time to digest each release before the next, now each project lands seemingly together, all clamoring for attention. It doesn't help that so many records have begun to adopt extreme measures in length, going one way or the other in an effort to appeal to repeat listens or garner gaudier streaming statistics for their respective creators in the ever-saturated marketplace.
However, even with all the changes to the modern musical and technological landscape that offers up more and more options, one principle will always remain the same: The cream always rises to the top. Some projects will always stand out from the pack, through the care of their creators or the magic inherent to their execution. Bangers will always be bangers, bops will always be bops, great rappers will always shine, and the best beats will stand the test of time and multiple listens. Albums that impress will live long past their initial release, making you return to them even as the onslaught of new music continues.
From Nipsey Hussle to Cardi B and everything in between, here are the best rap albums that have impressed in 2018 so far.
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — The billboard is blunt by design.
“Black Lives SHOULD Matter, Especially to BLACK PEOPLE. STOP THE VIOLENCE. We don't want your business That bad.”
The bearer of this message is Marlan J. Gary, and his business is funerals.
Columbus is coming off a year of horrendous homicidal violence. There were 143 killings in 2017, a total unlike anything the city had seen in decades. The old record of 139 homicides occurred in 1991.
That was the year Gary came to Columbus. He was in his early 20s, and the surging homicide rate was not something a young man in a new town thought much about.
“I just wasn't community-minded, even to have an opinion,” he said.
Now he is a 48-year-old father of two, a community-minded businessman and, as the billboard makes clear, a holder of opinions.
This latest advertisement for Marlan J. Gary Funeral Home went up about two weeks ago on two billboards: one at East Main Street and Nelson Road on the Near East Side and another at East 5th and Woodland avenues.
Gary has advertised on billboards for years, and occasionally he alters the messages to reflect holidays or celebrate Black History Month.
The start of a new year, coming hard on the heels of such a violent one, seemed to him a good time to make a point.
In 2017, 111 of the city's homicide victims were Black, and all but of 10 of them were males. The median age was 29. Fewer than half of the killings have been solved, but Gary intuits that most of these young Black male victims were killed by other young Black men. He's handled the arrangements for more homicide victims than he can count, and he knows this as surely as the police do.
So far, the response to his message has been positive. He said he doesn't know if he'll receive any push-back for co-opting the language of the Black Lives Matter movement that began in 2013 in response to police killings of Black people.
These issues matter to Gary, who is Black and has a son about to turn 18 years old. In 2015, Gary irked the Columbus Division of Police with billboards that directly addressed the BLM movement by offering advice to young Black men (cooperate, don't commit crimes, don't run) and to officers (“You can stop me without killing me” and “I deserve a day in court, not in a casket”).
The Police Division released a statement in response that it was “disappointed” by the message, given officers' community-policing efforts.
“I'm all in support of the Black Lives Matter movement,” Gary said on Jan. 26. “At the same time, I realize that it has to matter to us before it matters to anybody else.
“The bottom line is that I don't bury a whole lot of people who were killed by police,” he said. “Right now, I'm burying a lot of Black people who are killed at the hands of Black people.”
Pictured beside Gary on the latest billboards is Fralisia Jefferson, one of his funeral directors. Jefferson, 25, lost her 27-year-old godbrother, DeShawn L. Marable, to gun violence last year. He was shot to death on the South Side in August, and his killing remains unsolved.
Jefferson said young people “feel invincible, untouchable, until it touches you and gets closer … and then it touches your immediate family, and then it's too late.”
Retaliation perpetuates the violence, she said.
“When you fight fire with fire, all you get is a bigger fire,” she said. ” “We're getting to a dangerous point.”
Nine people have been killed in Columbus this year; eight were black. Gary hopes the billboards add to a community conversation that makes 2018 a record low year for homicides and the heartbreak that follows.
“I just thought it would be great if we could try to beat that record,” he said. “It would be nice if we could just move back toward the record low.”

There's also a variant of the pump targeted at type 2 diabetes. Intarcia started the paperwork on commercial use in November, so you could see it in use relatively soon.
Any practical implementation of the HIV pump is years away. Intarcia still has to settle on a drug to use, and there are regulations and similar hurdles to clear before it's ready to use. If it's deployed as promised, though, it could go a long way toward reducing the influence of HIV and AIDS in places like sub-Saharan Africa, where the virus remains a serious problem. Like with many medicines, the biggest challenge is simply getting people to take preventative drugs on a consistent basis -- this would make it much less of a hassle. Cost is still a concern (will the medicine be inexpensive enough that wide distribution is practical?), but the technology is at least in place.

Lincolnshire County Council leader Martin Hill has again called on health bosses to reveal their plans for the future of services in the county in more detail following Tuesday's CQC report.
ULHT was rated as ‘requiring improvement' overall following inspections which took place earlier this year.
It actually received ‘good' ratings in 72% of the inspection areas, but this was not enough to move the trust up more than a notch.
The report has seen the trust say it is ‘moving in the right direction', however it remains in special measures.
Speaking on Tuesday, County Council leader Martin Hill praised the good news, however, he said the report demonstrated “what we already know about our hospitals in Lincolnshire.”
He said it was ‘encouraging' to see the trust progressing.
However, he said: “I think there still remains a concern particularly at Boston around children's services and indeed some issues at Lincoln.
“It is good that there's good progress, and they are beginning to get themselves into a better place.”
He added recruitment was still the major problem the trust has, but repeated that it was ‘imperative, now more than ever' that future plans for services were revealed.
The Sustainability and Trasformation Plan (STP) process started in 2016, but health bosses said it won't be ready until 2019, despite £1.2 million being spent on it already.
Martin Hill said: “If you want to sort out recruitment and give confidence to the public and to employees, please come out with your plans for the future so there is confidence that there is a good NHS services in the future.
“I do get get frustrated that nationally the NHS takes some time to bring forward plans. Things will be different, but if you're going to have to change, be open about it and come forward as soon as possible with what you're planning to do.”
In the CQC report Lincoln County Hospital was rated overall as ‘requires improvement, and Boston as ‘inadequate', while Grantham and Louth were both rated as ‘good'.
The comments follow a letter sent by Councillor Hill and leader of South Kesteven District Council Councillor Matthew Lee on Monday asking them to reveal their plans for the future of Grantham A&E, which remains closed at night due to staffing shortages.
HOWELL – The Township Zoning Board of Adjustment rescheduled the hearing for a proposed farm and home where the owner would also have a skeet shooting range.
The application for “Wildbrook Ranch” began last year, but was restarted at the January 23 meeting. An engineer for the property, a sound expert and a shooting expert were all interviewed during that meeting. It was supposed to be continued at the February 13 meeting. However, notice was given from the board postponing that meeting to April.
The plan calls for tree orchards, crops, an indoor riding area, a barn, paddocks, a clubhouse for personal use with three residential apartments above it, and a skeet shooting field.
The owner, Alex Adjmi, told officials he planned on this property all being for his own personal use. There would not be customers coming to the property. There are five lanes for the skeet shooting, and it would not attract more than a handful of friends and family. He said he would eventually be building his own home there, as well as homes for each of his three sons. The business interests would include crops grown, fruit from trees, and breeding horses.
The property owner needs to apply for a use variance to build and operate there. It is currently in the ARE-6 agricultural rural estate zone,
The neighbor, Lori and Bryan Oakes, retained Freehold attorney Mark Williams to represent them.
Board members wanted to make sure that the skeet shooting would only be done during certain hours, and that an expert was always on hand. Other questions from the board included the height of a decorative cupola above the barn, fencing, and lighting.
There were still a few more experts to be interviewed in the case. The application was carried to the April 3 meeting at 7:30 p.m.
In the first of a three-part series examining the impact of dementia in the UK, Chris Bond talked to Brian Robinson who was diagnosed with the condition four years ago.
In November, dementia overtook heart disease as the leading cause of death in England and Wales. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), more than 61,000 people died of dementia last year – which equates to 11.6 per cent of all recorded deaths.
Support: Brian Robinson, who has dementia, and his wife Pauline. (James Hardisty).
The change is largely down to the fact that we have an ageing population. More people are living longer and deaths from some other causes, like heart disease, have gone down. Also, doctors have become better at diagnosing dementia and the condition is now given more emphasis on death certificates.
Nevertheless, it was a significant moment and a stark reminder that currently “no-one survives a diagnosis of dementia”, as Hilary Evans, chief executive of Alzheimer's Research UK, said recently.
At the same time, though, dementia is not an inevitable part of ageing. It's caused by diseases that can be fought through research and finding a breakthrough in this battle has arguably become the greatest medical challenge of our age.
But what is it like for those living with the condition and their families?
Brian Robinson was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2013. This is a relatively uncommon form of dementia and is triggered by damage to the frontal lobe of the brain, but it's a significant cause of dementia in younger people, with most people diagnosed between the ages of 45 and 65.
Brian, from Leeds, was in his early 60s when he was given the devastating news that he was suffering from the disease. Since then his physical health has declined, his speech is a little slurred and he has problems with his short-term memory.
His wife Pauline says she first became alarmed after he passed out a couple of times on their sofa at home. She became increasingly concerned when one morning he had no recollection of getting to work.
“On this particular day he went to work, which usually took him 20 minutes but this time he couldn't remember leaving the house and getting to the school where he worked as a cleaner. Then he went wandering off and they brought him home.”
It precipitated a worrying decline in his health. “His memory went and he started forgetting things so we went to the doctors and they sent him for MRI scans and that's when he was diagnosed with dementia. It was a shock to us both and we cried a bit,” she says. “But we got through it,” adds Brian, tenderly.
The initial weeks and months after being told the devastating news was hard on them both. “I didn't lose my dignity but it meant I couldn't drive and to start with I wouldn't go outside because I felt embarrassed. I felt like a failure because if people looked at me they didn't see anything wrong with me,” says Brian.
“He was a hard-working man and suddenly he had to stop,” says Pauline. “I used to take him into town and I'd say, ‘it's nothing to be ashamed of you've got to walk with your head up because there are lots of people with dementia.'”
They put on a brave face but at times it's been an uphill struggle. “We just keep going, but he does forget things. The other night he got up and I said ‘where are you going?' And he said ‘I've got to wash the pots' and the next second he'd totally forgotten what he was doing.”
We are sat in a sunlit room at Armley Grange, a specialist day centre run by the Alzheimer's Society in Leeds which offers a community support service for younger people with dementia, including some still in their 40s.
Brian comes to the day centre four times a week though he still lives at home with Pauline. He sometimes gets stuck on words but he's still lucid and dementia hasn't been able to cloud over his sunny disposition.
He's been coming to Armley Grange for 18 months and says it's made a big difference to him. “Wherever I've gone I've always tried to make people laugh and what I like about it here is you can have a laugh and a joke. And if you ever get upset they'll have a little talk with you and you feel 10 times better.
“The staff here are wonderful. Here they treat you like a human being. They class everyone the same they don't just put you in a corner, they encourage you to do things.”
Since coming here he's taken up drawing, something he hadn't done before. “I've started doing art and they've put some of my artwork on the walls. I'm not great, but I'm learning and I enjoy it.”
The staff at the centre encourage Brian and other dementia sufferers to take part in activities. They play dominoes and cards and there's a jukebox, too. “I like my music, especially the 50s and 60s stuff, and we have sing-songs and it's great fun, they call me ‘the DJ,'” he says, laughing.
In the summer months Brian does a spot of gardening (he's growing potatoes) or he might join one of the day trips organised by the centre to a local museum, or park.
There are dark times, too, and after 43 years together this is not the retirement that Brian, who turned 66 last month, and Pauline would have wanted.
But their bravery, love and stoicism is an example to us all. “When you get any diagnosis you go through certain emotions, first of all it's denial then anger and then acceptance. The first six months were hard but when you feel supported you feel like you can move on,” says Pauline.
Together they, along with their daughter, as well as friends and the staff at Armley Grange, bring light to what is a dreadful situation. “I know I'm not going to get any better but I've gone through my pain,” says Brian. “I'm expecting to get worse, but I've got my family, what I call my little bubble.”
There are few words in the English language that strike such fear in people as ‘dementia' does. And with good reason. It is a harrowing condition, one that can rob people of their character while their families face the anguish of watching the person they love slowly disappear in front of them.
But at the same time there is support out there and in research centres up and down the country scientists are busy trying to halt the progress of this remorseless condition and one day, hopefully, stop it altogether.
What people like Brian and Pauline offer is a message of hope. “Once you get over the fact someone has dementia you find a way of coping. Brian does still do things, he's not just withering away.”
He nods in agreement. “When I was first diagnosed I sat in the corner and thought ‘that's it'. I was frightened. But now I'd say to people who have been diagnosed with dementia ‘don't be frightened, there is light at the end of the tunnel.
“You might be a bit slow but you've still got a brain, you're not useless. And you're not on your own, there is support out there... and once you realise that, that's when you start living.”
Dementia in numbers
According to research by the Alzheimer's Society more than 850,000 people in the UK have dementia.
It is estimated that 225,000 people will develop dementia this year, that's one every three minutes.
At present, one in six people over the age of 80 have dementia.
Alzheimer's disease accounts for 62 per cent of dementia cases.
Up to a quarter of hospital beds are occupied by people with dementia at any one time.
Two-thirds of the cost of dementia is paid by people with dementia and their families.
If anyone has any concerns about dementia they can go to alzheimers.org.uk to find their local branch or call the national helpline number which is 0300 222 11 22.
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — A United Nations expert on extreme poverty and human rights is meeting with hurricane victims in Puerto Rico, marking the first time such an envoy has visited the U.S. territory in recent history.
Special rapporteur Philip Alston's trip Monday comes as Puerto Ricans and some government officials voice complaints that the U.S. has not provided sufficient help after Hurricane Maria hit the island on Sept. 20.
The Category 4 storm killed dozens of people and destroyed tens of thousands of homes. Ten of the island's 78 municipalities are still without power, and thousands of businesses remain closed.
Alston told The Associated Press that there is a disproportionate number of Puerto Ricans living in poverty and that he's trying to assess the effectiveness of measures taken by the federal government.

Awudu Issaka
Former Ghana Black Stars winger Awudu Issaka says the whole nation must support the Under 17 team if they are to make a meaningful impact in the 2017 FIFA Under 17 World Cup.
Issaka was one of the stars of the tournament over two decades ago as Ghana won their second Under 17 World Cup trophy in Ecuador in 1995.
The man nicknamed “Disco Dancer” has tasked all Ghanaians to give the team the needed backing as they can do something meaningful in India.
“Everything starts from the first game this morning, It is very very important. Always, first games are difficult and the players cannot even sleep. The team need the support and prayers of all Ghanaians to succeed,” Issaka told Oman FM
“The players must be disciplined and very determined to do something for Ghana. They must go all outs and should not panic that they are playing against whites. They have to be focused,”
Ghana will face Colombia in New Delhi this morning in a Group A encounter.

As Dell Technologies publicly confirmed that it was exploring a number of potential transactions — ranging from an initial public offering to a combination with VMware, of which it owns 80 percent — much of the media coverage has focused on why it's doing so.
One theory has been the company's debt, of which there is a lot (particularly after its $67 billion takeover of data storage company EMC in 2016). A combination with VMware could help provide a way for Dell to manage its balance sheet, through both additional earnings power and the ability to raise money through stock sales.
But a closer look at Dell's financials suggests that the company doesn't have to strike a deal solely to manage its debt.
Diving In
Dell has a total of roughly $52.5 billion in gross debt. But company executives have explained to debt investors that such a number doesn't factor in a number of mitigating circumstances:
■ About $4 billion of that is investment-grade long-term debt that sits at VMware.
■ About $6 billion is held by Dell Financial Services, which is backed by computer equipment and, Dell has argued, shouldn't be lumped in with general corporate bonds or loans.

■ Then there's a $2 billion margin loan, which is backed by $8 billion worth of VMware stock.
That leaves us with what Dell internally calls $40.3 billion in net debt.
"A major component of this training includes a variety of scenarios that are designed to evaluate officer's skills in effectively communicating with people in crisis and those who are suffering from a possible mental disorder," said an email from the union.
Meanwhile, recruits at the Ontario Police College are now receiving more training, as are a number of police forces around the province, though it's yet to be a provincewide standard, said Dube.
Christian Leuprecht, a professor at Royal Military College in Kingston, Ont., who studies policing and security issues, said Lam's actions were "textbook" examples of the latest approaches.
The result is a suspect who is now in custody and who may be able to shed light on why the devastating incident occurred, he said.
Police say Minassian, 25, of Richmond Hill, Ont., is the lone suspect in the attack. He was charged Tuesday with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder.
At a news conference Tuesday, Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders said: "Our officer defaulted to his training and as a result we have successful outcomes."
Leuprecht noted how Lam only stood up after carefully observing the suspect and determining he didn't have a gun.
Lam spoke loudly and calmly, even as the suspect encouraged the officer to shoot him. When he claimed to have a gun in his pocket, Lam replied, "I don't care," and repeatedly instructed him to "Get down."
Leuprecht said Lam seemed to go further than some others might have when he decided to approach and arrest the suspect, rather than wait for backup.
"There's an impressive moment when he takes his firearm, puts it in his holster, he goes over with his baton, and he handcuffs the individual," he said.
"I think that goes above and beyond the call of duty. He could have had a knife. He could have had a suicide belt."
However, the university professor, who is currently teaching in Australia, says if the constable had waited for backup, the situation might have escalated and had a different outcome.
"The opportunity to ensure the individual could no longer pose a chance of harm to himself or to others is what that officer jumped at," said Leuprecht.
McCormack said while additional training is a factor, he knows Lam well enough to say his personality factored in.
He described him as an intelligent, relatively young officer who is highly skilled and trained.
McCormack says the constable — who is in his 30s — positioned himself well so that he could see precisely what was unfolding before him.
"By his actions he did not perceive the threat to escalate and that is why he did not use his firearm," he said.

Police: Death toll rises to 12 in London blaze
The death toll in the blaze that engulfed a residential tower in west London early on Wednesday has risen to 12 and “will rise further,” Metropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy said. Emergency services are continuing a “long and complex operation'' in the building, and the “incredibly challenging'' task of confirming how many people are missing. “It is very, very challenging to put a number on those unaccounted for,'' Cundy told reporters.

TORONTO -
U.S. customs officials have released a photo of a mock improvised explosive device that led to delays at Toronto's Pearson International Airport when it was found in a passenger's luggage earlier this month.
United States Customs and Border Protection tweeted the photo Monday morning and praised the officers who spotted the device on April 6.
The discovery of the item during an inspection at the airport's pre-clearance area caused what was described as a major security breach.
Passengers on a United Airlines flight to Chicago were stuck on the tarmac for more than four hours before they could disembark.
An American man — 58-year-old Joseph Galaska — was charged with one count of mischief in connection with the incident.
He was released on bail and his case is due back in a Toronto-area court on Tuesday, though his lawyer says he will not appear in person.
Galaska's wife has told ABC News the device found was an alarm clock.

One from this week's @NewYorker. Hello politics, my names Will. pic.twitter.com/5LfNYnOgMA — Will McPhail (@WillMcPhail) January 2, 2017
Donald Trump has made countless ridiculous claims throughout his campaign, election victory and ongoing transition. They range in content, length, and believably, though they often pertain to what his most recent boast about “know[ing] things that other people don't know” about Russia's alleged email hacking — knowledge.
And not just general knowledge, but knowing what's best for America while claiming current and outgoing elected officials — many of them schooled experts — do not. Hence the gimmick behind New Yorker cartoonist Will McPhail's latest for the weekly magazine, which is causing quite a stir on Twitter.
McPhail shared the cartoon on Twitter Monday morning, a week ahead of its scheduled publication, by saying “Hello politics, my names Will.” In the cartoon, a black-shirted man stands above the other passengers aboard an airplane and exclaims, “These smug pilots have lost touch with regular passengers like us. Who thinks I should fly the plane?” In addition to the speaker, roughly half of the people seen on the flight raise their hands in agreement.
As of this writing, McPhail's tweet has earned over 4,500 retweets and almost 6,500 likes. No wonder so many journalists, political pundits, and Twitter trolls have taken a liking (or not) to the new cartoon and the implied anti-Trump and Trump supporter sentiments therein.

To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Levi's trucker jacket, the brand asked pop superstar Justin Timberlake to help give the staple a redesign. He shared a couple of photos of the new piece via Instagram.

Timberlake posted, “For the 50th bday of the trucker jacket, @Levis asked me to redesign one. I did and ever since, it's been my favorite drinking buddy. 🍻👌🏻 #Denim #Flannel #LiveInLevis.”
The jacket features a Hank Williams patch that says, “Why don't you mind your own business.”
Timberlake has some experience as a clothing designer, having launched the William Rast brand with Trace Ayala in 2005.

Aiming at China's Armpits: When Foreign Brands Misfire Image Because of cultural and biological differences, deodorants are a tough sell in China. Credit Giulia Marchi for The New York Times
BEIJING — Unilever brought its Rexona deodorant to China a decade ago, dreaming of a market with 2.6 billion armpits.
Wages were rising, consumers were spending and the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics was making Chinese people feel more cosmopolitan. More of them, it stood to reason, would be open to a Western hygiene product.
“We had created established markets for Rexona from scratch in many countries, and we did not see any reason why we couldn't do the same in China,” Frank Braeken, Unilever's former China head, said by telephone from Dubai, where he now works as an investment consultant.
“We had an extremely ambitious plan at the time,” Mr. Braeken said.
But cultural differences and simple biology — scientists have shown that many East Asian people don't have Westerners' body odor issues — scotched those plans. Sales totaled only a fraction of the Chinese marketing budget for Rexona, Mr. Braeken said. Today, by some estimates, less than 10 percent of China's population uses deodorant, and it can be hard to find outside major cities.
China's growing consumer class has fueled global growth and lifted the fortunes of Starbucks, KFC and a host of other Western brands. Many Chinese people now drink coffee instead of tea, eat cheese and ice cream despite potential tummy tremors, and guzzle ice-cold sodas in a country where grandmothers express a mortal fear at any liquid below room temperature.
But the drive to win China's consumers has had its notable failures.
Like tampons.
Most Chinese women use sanitary pads because they believe tampons are invasive. In 2016, China spent $136 million on tampons, only a fraction of the $4.9 billion annual sales for sanitary pads and towels in the country, according to data from Mintel, a consulting firm.
Procter & Gamble, the American consumer products company, gave up on Tampax in China in 2000, though it relaunched the brand last year. In a statement, Li Fengting, China director for the Tampax brand, said it had reintroduced the product in hopes of attracting a younger generation of women.
Then there's Weetabix. Bright Food, a Shanghai-based company, bought a majority stake in the maker of the oblong staple of British breakfasts in 2012, hoping the cereal biscuits would find their way onto the Chinese family menu. It sold the stake to an American firm five years later, after what analysts said was a lackluster performance. A Bright Food spokesman, Pan Jianjun, said the decision to sell was part of the company's international strategy but declined to comment further.
Companies like Apple and Starbucks have prospered in part by selling aspirational products to Chinese consumers who want to show the world that they have made it. That task is tougher for products that nobody sees.
“It has to be something visible or something you can smell,” said Ye Tan, an independent economist in Shanghai. “Deodorant fails partly because it is invisible.”
The products have their Chinese adherents. Cai Qianyi, a 38-year-old media professional in Beijing, started using deodorant in 2006, when he was studying in France. He doesn't think he has body odor but sees a problem with sweat stains.
“Sweat leaving wet spots on your T-shirt in the summer is extremely ugly, especially around the armpits, which could be really socially embarrassing,” Mr. Cai said.
But most of his family and friends have no idea what deodorant is, he said. Once, a cousin mistook his deodorant stick for perfume and asked him why it was solid.
When global deodorant makers began their foray into China, they highlighted the social embarrassment caused by perspiration. Their central message was a proven winner in the West: Sweating will get you shunned socially and ruin your chances for romance.

That pitch fell on deaf ears in China, said Lucia Liu, a skin care assistant manager at Unilever who was involved in Rexona's marketing between 2011 and 2016.
“The traditional thinking here is that sweating is good because it helps people detox,” said Ms. Liu. “There is a marketing barrier that is really hard to overcome.”
Indeed, Chinese health websites have long promoted the benefits of sweating, ranging from a boost in immunity to memory enhancement to skin rejuvenation. To many Chinese, perspiration is a natural part of metabolism that should not be blocked.
There's another reason few Chinese consumers buy deodorant: basic biology.
Scientists in recent years have shown that many East Asians, a group that includes China's ethnic Han majority, have a gene that lowers the likelihood of a strong “human axillary odor” — scientist-speak for body stink.
That lowers the likelihood that they will use deodorant to begin with, according to a 2013 study by researchers at the University of Bristol and Brunel University in Britain, after a survey of nearly 6,500 women of various backgrounds.
“It is likely that deodorant usage is not widely adopted because there is, for much of the East Asia population, no need for it,” it said. (For those curious about such matters, that same genetic difference also leads to drier earwax.)
Unilever was not deterred. It deployed a range of traditional marketing tools, including signing top celebrities to appear in TV ads, in-store product sampling and sweat tests, and concert sponsorships.
Many of its efforts seem tone deaf in retrospect.
A series of Rexona print ads portrayed a person's armpits as potential threats to others. In one, a gunslinger — his armpit hovering over the scene in the foreground — appears to take down his opponent without touching his revolver. In a similar ad, a boxer appears to knock out his opponent with little more than his aroma.
Ng Tian It, a Singaporean creative director who oversaw the ad campaign, was proud of the look. But he said the ads appeared to be out of touch with many Chinese consumers unfamiliar with Old West shootouts, professional boxing and the prospect of offensive underarm smells.
“The series of advertisements we designed relied on the Western sense of humor,” he said. “Not many Chinese would understand this.”
Deodorant sales in the United States reached $4.5 billion in 2016, according to Euromonitor, a market research firm. China's total: $110 million. Deodorant also does not sell well in other East Asian markets: Japan's sales that year were about one-tenth those of the United States.
Companies hoping to sell deodorant in China have had to appeal to other senses. Nivea, a brand owned by Beiersdorf A.G. of Germany, has tried to lure female Chinese consumers by rolling out deodorants with whitening functions, to cater to a market where fair skin often confers social status.
Simon Cao, Nivea's China marketing director, said that the deodorant was popular but that “the room for growth is very limited.”
“We will not spend too much energy on deodorant, because the investment is not proportional to the return,” he said.
The dearth of deodorants in China has forced some expatriates to hoard.
Alex Stevens, a 26-year-old American former public relations professional who left Beijing last year after living there nearly a decade, said he loaded up on deodorant every time he was back in the United States.
“It's really become the only thing I stock up on when I go back home,” he said, “and I don't give any away to friends, not even for a price.”

Laurent Duvernay-Tardif doesn't have to worry about what he's going to do when his NFL career is over.
Duvernay-Tardif, an excellent guard for the Kansas City Chiefs, has somehow been juggling professional football and medical school for many years and succeeding at both. He said he will graduate from McGill University's medical school in Montreal on Tuesday.
[Yahoo Fantasy Football leagues are open: Sign up now for free]
Earlier this offseason Duvernay-Tardif said he wanted the NFL to allow him to add “M.D.” to the end of his name on his Chiefs jersey — which the NFL should allow without a second thought. He had been talking to the league office about the jersey change, and now he has a better argument since he's officially a doctor.
Proud graduate
Duvernay-Tardif announced on his Twitter feed that he's going to graduate this week, and that's worth telling the world about.
This is it! Today I become a doctor! It also marks the beginning of a great new adventure for all 2018 graduates of @mcgillu Faculty of Medicine. #LDTMD #graduation #passion #nfl #chiefs pic.twitter.com/j4oD1BCuXJ — Laurent D. Tardif (@LaurentDTardif) May 29, 2018
It's a great accomplishment for anyone to graduate medical school, but most med students don't juggle an NFL career. Duvernay-Tardif started in medical school in 2010, so this has been a long journey for him.
Story Continues
Splitting time between football and medicine
While the rest of the Chiefs took some time off after playoff losses each of the past two seasons, Duvernay-Tardif went right to medical school. He has said repeatedly during the past few years that the Chiefs and particularly coach Andy Reid have been great about allowing him to pursue his medical degree.
The Global News in Canada said Duvernay-Tardif's schedule last summer was to treat patients while training in anesthesia during the morning, then in the afternoon he'd be in the gym to keep with his training schedule.
Duvernay-Tardif even found some similarities between his two professions.
“In an emergency department, you have to be able to stay calm, relaxed and apply rational algorithms to different situations in order to save patients lives,” Duvernay-Tardif told the Global News last summer. “When you're on the field in front of 80,000 people and everyone's yelling at you, you've got to stay calm, you've got to analyze different scenarios and apply the algorithm of the protection on that play.”
Duvernay-Tardif still in his NFL prime
It's hard to decide what's more amazing: That Duvernay-Tardif was able to become a doctor while playing professional football, or that he was able to become one of the NFL's best guards while studying medicine.
Duvernay-Tardif has been a regular starter for a very good Chiefs team each of the past three seasons. When he starts his full-time career in medicine he'll already have all those student loans paid off; Duvernay-Tardif signed a five-year deal worth more than $43 million in February of 2017.
Everyone in the NFL has an interesting tale. But Duvernay-Tardif's story is fascinating, even by NFL standards.

Former President Rawlings and his wife, Nana Konadu Agyeman Rawlings
A Member of the New Patriotic Party's Communication team, Yazeed Adam has asked former President and founder of the National Democratic Congress, Jerry John Rawlings to join his wife at NDP since he is not welcome by members of his own political party, National Democratic Congress.
According to the Techiman-based communicator, is it worrying that although the former President worked hard to make the party what it is today, ‘some babies with sharp teeth' tear him apart and vilify him like a nobody in the party.
He indicated that like he did in building the NDC into a formidable force, the former president should join forces with his wife to build another formidable force that will hand the existing political parties a run for their money during electioneering periods
He said “Since he is still strong and has a lot of meaningful contributions to make in Ghana politics but the current NDC leadership wouldn't allow him to talk, my candid opinion is for our Father to leave the NDC for them, join her wife Mrs Konadu Agyeman Rawlings in the NDP where he will be allowed to operate fully”.
The communicator indicated that attempts by Rawlings to take back his party by planting his boys in vital positions will be futile since the Mahama boys have the resources and will quash any attempt by Rawlings through manipulating elections with their resources.

A FORMER family day care business operator who believed for years that a university education was out of reach is now achieving top grades in an Early Childhood Education degree at USC Gympie.
Gympie mother of four Kathleen Pitt, 42, said she hoped to inspire her family and fellow students at the USC Gympie campus.
"I am the first in my family to attend university so I am a bit of a pioneer,” she said.
"It took me a long time to believe in myself, after leaving high school during Year 10 and returning without too much success to complete Year 11 and 12 as a mature-age student.
"My inspiration was my children.
"I wanted them to know that not everyone is academic at high school, and it is okay to study later when you have discovered your passion in life.”
Mrs Pitt said that having the opportunity to study locally encouraged her to take the first step towards chasing her career goal, starting in 2015 with the University's award-winning Tertiary Preparation Program, TPP.
"I am grateful that I was able to complete TPP as a pathway to the Bachelor of Education (Early Childhood),” she said.
"It removed some of my misconceptions, assisted my learning and gave me confidence during the first semester of my degree,”
"For anyone who has doubts about whether they could attend university, I say just give it a try.
"It is surprising how well you can actually do and how much you will enjoy learning and making connections with like-minded people.”
Mrs Pitt, whose goal is to work as an early childhood teacher, attributes part of her study success to the supportive, close-knit environment of the Gympie campus.
"The friendly administration staff and lecturers do all they can to help you achieve your goals.”
She now supports other students in her new roles as Student Success Officer and Career Development team assistant.
"It is rewarding to share my knowledge and experience, and to help other students improve their skills while developing my own communication and leadership skills,” said Mrs Pitt, also a long-time member of the Centenary Gympie Scout Group.

This is an article from the BBC's LDRS (Local Democracy Reporter Service) scheme, which OnTheWight is taking part in. Final paragraph by us. Ed
The number of A-Level students achieving grades AAB or better on the Isle of Wight was just over half the national average last year.
The number achieving AAB, including two facilitating subjects (those recognised by Russell Group universities) was 7.7 per cent on the Island, compared to 14.7 per cent nationally.
In keeping with the new Progress 8 measure applied at Key Stage Four, the seven Island providers had a P8 score ranging from 0.08 to -0.25.
Post 16 levels of attainment remain variable
County Manager for Hampshire Futures, David Walker said:
“Young people on the Island are no less able or ambitious than their peers elsewhere, nor is the level of commitment from teachers for their success. “Nonetheless, levels of attainment, post 16, at a local authority level remain variable and are particularly poor for A-Level programmes.”
Outcomes for tech-level programmes at a post 16 level were judged to be significantly above the national average, as was the average awarded grade of a distinction.
Andre: Consolidate sixth forms
Speaking at the Policy and Scrutiny Committee for Children's Services, Cllr Debbie Andre said:
“One of my concerns is that we have perhaps too many providers and we need to look at ways, and what is being in done, to consolidate the sixth forms so that we are centres for excellence. “We can have fewer centres that are providing A-Level subjects that students want to study.”
Percentage of the highest grades below average
The committee papers also revealed that the proportions of A-level students who achieved the highest grades is significantly below national and statistical neighbour averages, with the gap widening on many measures. This is a key determinate for progression to higher education.
In 2017, the proportion of students achieving 3+ A*-A grades at A-level was 7.1% on the Island.
This compares to 11.1% nationally and 11.8% regionally.

OTTAWA — Beating Jennifer Jones in the round-robin finale gave Rachel Homan the hammer for their rematch in the semifinal at the Tim Hortons Roar of the Rings.
The victory also appeared to give Homan and her Ottawa teammates peace of mind.
Coach Adam Kingsbury noticed it as soon as he arrived at their rental house on the outskirts of town Saturday morning. That feeling carried over into their 6-3 victory over Jones in the afternoon.
“There was a sense of purpose, calmness, and I felt it,” Kingsbury said.
In the men's semifinal on Saturday night, Winnipeg's Mike McEwen posted a 6-4 win over Brad Gushue of St. John's, N.L. McEwen will play Calgary's Kevin Koe in Sunday's final.
Earlier, Homan, third Emma Miskew, second Joanne Courtney and lead Lisa Weagle seemed to own the ice before an adoring crowd at Canadian Tire Centre.
The front end was relentless, Miskew was in form, Homan was clinical. They set an early tone and never really let Jones into the game.
Even Team Homan's misses seemed to work out. It was that kind of game for the national and world champions.
Jones hung in there but was not her usual self, shooting a rather pedestrian 76 per cent.
She simply looked defeated in the seventh end. Homan forced Jones to try to hit for a single, but the stone jammed and spun out to give Homan a steal of one.
Jones closed her eyes and lowered her head, knowing the game was most likely over.
“In order to be successful, you have to make the big ones when they matter,” she said.
With a two-point lead and hammer in the 10th, Homan was in control. Jones still made the final throw mean something by sitting three and forcing Homan to hit a takeout.
Homan delivered for the single point and the win to the delight of the 7,001 in attendance.
“We definitely amped it up for that one,” Miskew said. “We knew we had to.”
In the men's semifinal, McEwen scored the first deuce of the game with an aggressive double takeout in the fifth end.
A tremendous hit and roll in the eighth left Gushue with an in-off attempt that gave McEwen a steal of two. McEwen's brilliant shotmaking continued in the ninth with a runback double that forced Gushue to a single.
“That's as good as I've ever seen him,” Gushue said. “If he plays like that tomorrow, he wins for fun.”
Up two with hammer coming home, McEwen eliminated the reigning national and world champion.
“I'm glad he picked this moment to bring out his best,” said Team McEwen third B.J. Neufeld.
McEwen, Neufeld, second Matt Wozniak and lead Denni Neufeld shot 87 per cent overall to 83 per cent for the Gushue rink, which includes third Mark Nichols, second Brett Gallant and lead Geoff Walker.
Homan will next play Calgary's Chelsea Carey, who advanced to Sunday's championship by finishing first in round-robin play at 8-0.
Homan's lone loss of the round-robin came to Carey last weekend. The Ottawa team won its next seven games before dashing Jones's chances of defending the Olympic title she won at the 2014 Sochi Games.
“We're right exactly where we need to be,” Homan said.
After an opening blank, Jones delivered a nice freeze to force Homan to a single in the second end. Jones ticked a guard in the third end and Homan stole one for a 2-0 edge.
Jones got on the board in the fourth with a nose hit for a deuce. Homan answered in the fifth with a hit of her own for two and took a 4-2 lead into the mid-game break.
The Homan win means there will be new Olympic champions in both team events at the Pyeongchang Games. That reality seemed to sink in as the members of Team Jones fought back tears after leaving the ice.
“Right now, I'm kind of gutted,” Jones said.
The Sochi men's title went to Brad Jacobs of Sault Ste. Marie, Ont. He did not make the playoffs this week.
As a team, Jones, third Kaitlyn Lawes, second Jill Officer and lead Dawn McEwen shot 84 per cent overall.
Homan, meanwhile, shot an impressive 93 per cent while the team finished at 87 per cent.
“They're just on a mission,” Kingsbury said. “All four of them.”
Eliminated curlers can still qualify for the Olympics in mixed doubles. The discipline will make its first appearance on the Olympic program at the Feb. 9-25 Games.
Members of the Canadian four-player teams in Pyeongchang cannot compete in the mixed doubles competition.
Announced attendance for the evening draw was 7,161. That brought the overall total to 99,477.

Photography student Will Mayrick said he feared for his life when he was placed in a headlock and left struggling to breathe on a London underground train. Two 16-year-old boys were arrested in London last week for assaulting the 19-year-old and forcing him to apologize for being gay.
Mayrick is now speakiing out and says he's not sorry for his sexuality.
The Evening Standard reports:
Mr Mayrick, from Clapham, was with four friends on the way to a fancy dress event at the O2.
Police said the suspects held him in a headlock, throttled him and demanded that he apologise for being gay.
They also took his phone and threatened to stab him, according to police.
One of the victim's female friends, 25, was allegedly punched and pushed to the ground when she came to his defence.
Mr Mayrick, president of the LGBT society at Ravensbourne design and digital media college in Greenwich, said: “We'd got a bit of glitter on and they obviously didn't like that. They shouted ‘f***ing gays' and ‘fag', whatever they could think of. Then one grabbed hold of me and got my head in a headlock. The other grabbed my phone and tried to make me apologise for being gay. I said that's absolutely not going to happen, that's not who I am. But he got me so tight round the neck that if I didn't say something I wouldn't have been able to breathe. At the same time the other guy was pulling something out of his coat. I was so, so scared.”
Mayrick added:
“I'm proud of the fact that I'm gay, I would never want to change. I'm not sorry. But at the time I thought if I don't apologise I don't know what's going to happen. Possibly if homophobia was on their school curriculum it wouldn't have happened.”
Claire Harvey, CEO of Diversity Role Models, which works to tackle homophobic bullying in schools, said:
“Like many others, we were shocked when heard about the horrific attack on Will. We have been hugely impressed by his determination to turn this terrible experience into something that will, ultimately, have a positive impact, and we are delighted that he is helping us to promote greater inclusion and empathy by sharing his story.”
Calling for a review of hate crime laws, in a statement Stonewall said:
“It's 2017 – lesbian, gay, bi and trans people should feel safe and no one should face hatred simply because of who they are. Sadly, the reality is very different. Our research shows that one in five LGBT people have experienced a hate crime or incident in the last 12 months. Homophobia, biphobia and transphobia are nothing new, but when witnessed, how we respond defines the kind of world we want to live in. We would also like to see a review of hate crime laws so that crimes based on sexual orientation, gender identity or disability are treated equally to those based on race and faith.”
British Transport Police said they were treating the incident as a hate crime. The two suspects, who were arrested following a public appeal, have been released on bail.

CULLOWHEE, N.C. — Mike Amius had his second career double-double and Devin Peterson made five 3-pointers and finished with 25 points, both career highs, on Saturday night to help Western Carolina beat Samford 88-71.
Amius had career highs with 28 points, on 12-of-14 shooting, and 13 rebounds. Peterson made 10 of 16 from the field.
Demetrius Denzel-Dyson's 3-pointer gave Samford (8-17, 4-8 Southern Conference) an 8-0 lead and Alex Thompson's layup made 15-11 with 11 minutes left in the first half. The Bulldogs missed their next nine field-goal attempts and committed four turnovers as Western Carolina scored 17 of the next 19 points to take an 11-point lead six minutes later. Peterson scored 11 points, including three 3s, during that stretch and the Catamounts, who took a 38-27 lead into the break, led the rest of the way.
Eric Adams tied his career high, set in Thursday's loss to East Tennessee State, with 21 points and grabbed a career-best 11 rebounds for Samford.
Western Carolina (11-13, 6-5) shot 51 per cent from the field, had 21 assists on 33 field goals and outrebounded the Bulldogs 50-25.
WASHINGTON (AP) – President Donald Trump plans to sign legislation to extend temporarily a program that gives veterans access to private-sector health care.
White House spokesman Sean Spicer says Trump will sign the bill Wednesday at the White House.
The extension will provide stopgap services while Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin develops a longer-term plan to allow veterans to more easily go outside the VA medical system for care. Under the bill, the VA will be allowed to operate its Choice program until the funding runs out.
The program is set to expire in August without the legislation, and with nearly $1 billion in the account.
The Choice program was developed after a 2014 scandal over wait times at the VA medical center in Phoenix. Some veterans died.

A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Dec 12, 2017 at 3:00pm PST
Beyonce is generally accepted to be at the top of her field in the music industry — even if the Grammys can't seem to honor her properly. Still, there are plenty of other organizations and entities in the world who have noted her work, and not just as a musician.
This past weekend at the second annual Wearable Art Gala in Los Angeles, Beyonce was honored for her work giving back to her community, including some public thanks from a fan suffering from a bone disease who Beyonce reached out to and a video of congratulations from former First Lady Michelle Obama, who offered her love and noted that Beyonce personally inspires her.
The Wearable Art Gala is directed by Beyonce's mom, Tina Knowles-Lawson, who runs the event along with her husband Richard Lawson to benefit the WACO Theater Center. While accepting her award, Beyonce said she likes to keep her charity work quiet because she thinks she should be doing more, and that giving is reward enough. She also shouted out her own mother, saying she thought that Tina should be getting an award instead, and crediting her mother's example as a role model in her life.
Watch several clips from the event below.

Rotten Mackerel
The Mile 7 District Police have impounded four 20-footer containers suspected to contain tins of rotten mackerel imported into the country to be sold to unsuspecting members of the public.
The suspected rotten mackerel, with the brand name ‘Asahi,' was allegedly imported by one Kofi Dokyi, owner of Dokyispo Ventures that deals in general merchandise.
The items were said to have been cleared on September 30 at the Tema Port to be sold on the Ghanaian market.
Residents of the area, who could not withstand the pungent stench, had to report the matter to the police.
A resident told DAILY GUIDE that the warehouse owned by Mr Dokyi and where the rotten mackerels were to be kept was used for storing only used cloths at Ofankor.
He said their attention was drawn to the situation on Tuesday, October 2, when the offensive stench started reverberating through the air in the area.
“When I went there to find out the source of the scent – since we know the owner of the warehouse deals in only used clothing – I saw some boys discharging the said goods into the warehouse and asked what they were,” the resident averred.
He said they later realized that it was mackerel imported for sale.
The country from which the product was imported was not immediately known.
He said when he checked the expiry date on the product, he realized that it would expire in 2018 but was already rotten “and so we reported the matter to the police.”
Another resident, Sylvester Aidoo, told DAILY GUIDE that if they did not report the matter to the police as concerned citizens, they feared the rotten mackerel would be rebranded and sold to unsuspecting individuals.
When the paper got to the scene, one of the containers had already been discharged into the warehouse, but the three other containers were intact.
In an interview with drivers of the vehicles, they claimed they did not know the owner.
The Mile 7 police patrol team later visited the scene to escort the vehicles to the station.
When contacted, ASP Efia Tenge, Accra Regional Public Relations Officer, said residents visited the station to give a report on the said rotten mackerel.
The owner of the product, she said, was later invited to the station to give his statement.
Meanwhile, she said efforts were being made by the police to get officials of the Food and Drug Authority (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to advise the police on what to do.
The owner has since been granted police enquiry bail while investigation continues.
The vehicles containing the goods have also been impounded.
The Transportation and Finance ministries have made a unilateral decision to guarantee the jobs of 1,250 port employees, granting them immunity from layoffs through 2030 or 2032, despite previous promises to the contrary. The decision, which came as a surprise, was the subject of harsh disagreement within the government and came amid negotiations with unions representing Haifa and Ashdod port workers and with the Histadrut labor federation.
In a surprise move on Tuesday night, the two ministries gave in to the demands of the labor unions. The decision was announced in the National Labor Court in Jerusalem. The Government Companies Authority and the Finance Ministry's budgets division had vociferously objected to the move, which Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz approved in a sudden about-face, despite his public promises to the contrary.
The guarantee will be part of a new labor agreement, whose details have not been settled. It will include all port workers employed as of Tuesday, including temporary employees. This protects employees should the ports need to cut back staffing as private ports start operating and create competition. It guarantees workers' jobs for 10 years from the date thenew ports start operating, which is forecast to happen in 2021 or 2022, and for a total of 15 years from the date of the commitment.
This means the government port companies, which are collapsing under the burden of salaries, which equal 52% to 58% of their revenues — cannot dismiss redundant workers even if retaining them is not financially viable.
Economic forecasts conducted a year ago predicted that such a promise would cost the public as much as 2 billion to 2.5 billion shekels ($570 million to $610 million).

Katz, who had promised not to give in to the workers' demands and not to permit fictitious employment at the ports, made an inexplicable 180-degree turn. It was his ministry that had pushed to close a quick deal with the unions and Histadrut chairman Avi Nissenkorn.
But Katz is not authorized to dictate the government's stance on such macroeconomic issues, which involve dramatic changes in labor agreements and wages. Katz needed approval from Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, but officials at his bureau claimed on Wednesday morning that it had not been involved. The only senior offical who supported the move was the Finance Ministry's new head of the wages division, Eran Yaakov.
Surprisingly, neither ministry conditioned the guarantee for the employees, known as second-generation workers, on a retirement plan for first-generation port employees, and did not even condition the promise on halting the practice of fictitiously filling shifts, or expanding the number of hours for crane operators' shifts. Crane operators currently receive a full salary for a shift of only four hours.
Furthermore, it emerged that under pressure from the Transportation Ministry, a mention of the 2015 agreement in principle between the state, the Ashdod port union and the Histadrut was deleted from the agreement presented to the court. That agreement had not mentioned any commitment to guarantee the second-generation workers' jobs.
Katz is thought to be seeking to avoid a strike at the ports, in order to project leadership at a time of political upheaval.
The Transportation Ministry rejected the criticism on Wednesday, stating that the deal would indeed be conditioned on an efficiency plan.
A figure in the public sector who spoke with Haaretz on condition of anonymity called the promise “simply capitulation,” saying it was “crazy” to force government companies to retain hundreds of superfluous workers without receiving anything in terms of efficiency or increasing their output. ... In one moment the government simply gave up on everything it had demanded over years of negotiation.”
Preston North End's fine form continued with victory at Burton Albion.
Look back on Monday's news, including all the reaction, below.
Hundreds of people have attended a commemoration ceremony honoring a Croatian general who died after apparently taking poison at a United Nations tribunal that confirmed his war crimes conviction.
Two government ministers attended the ceremony organized by a generals' association and held Monday at the main concert hall in Zagreb, the capital. The gathering is seen as a display of resurging nationalism in the European Union's newest member state.
Slobodan Praljak gulped what he said was poison after judges at the war crimes court in The Hague, Netherlands, confirmed his conviction in an appeals hearing last month. Dutch authorities and the court have opened investigations into how he obtained the substance.
Many in Croatia consider Praljak a hero despite his conviction for war crimes in Bosnia during the 1992-95 war.
One minute Kenneth James Cernobyl was preparing to run errands with his wife, police said.
The next minute he struck her in the head with a baseball bat, police said.
The criminal complaint filed Saturday against Kenneth Cernobyl says the living room attack was unprovoked and Holly Ann Cernobyl, 48, was facing away from her husband when she was struck. It offers no motive for the alleged homicide.
The complaint says Kenneth Cernobyl, 49, admitted to police that he struck his wife around 12:10 p.m. Wednesday, Dec. 6, in their home in the 1000 block of Fifth Street in North Catasauqua.
Her body was found in the home at 8:39 p.m. Friday, Dec. 8. North Catasauqua police initially responded to the address for the report of a cardiac arrest, then called in state police to take over the investigation upon finding the victim, according to state police.
The report says Kenneth Cernobyl used a shirt to strangle his wife after he struck her with the bat. Both the bat blow and the strangulation resulted in her death, police said.
Then he removed his bloody clothes and her bloody clothes and dragged her body up to their second-floor bedroom, the report says. It says he put the bloody clothes in a trash bag which he then took to the basement.
Northampton County woman killed, man in custody, police say
On the morning of Friday, Dec. 8, he allegedly moved his wife's body from the bedroom to the base of the stairs next to exterior Bilco doors. That's where police found her, the criminal complaint says.
Kenneth Cernobyl was arraigned Friday by District Judge Antonia Grifo. He was sent to Northampton County Prison. Defendants charged with criminal homicide are not eligible for bail in Pennsylvania.

(WFLA) – It's like Black Friday all over again. That's how some websites are describing the push to sell large screen TVs just in time for Super Bowl Sunday.
Lots of football fans are using the Super Bowl as an excuse to trade up to a bigger TV.
But before you get out your credit card, you should know about some “must have” features your new set should have.
“We're really excited. Yeah, my kids can't wait. They were real disappointed when we thought we were going to get it last night, so now we're trying to get it for tomorrow,” said TV customer Gary Goz.
Goz is shopping for a new 4-K set for his movie room.
“Got to go as big as you can go. I think the jump from the 75's to the 80, 85's, it's just way too much. I think this gets to the point that's like, it's big enough,” said Goz, as he eyed a new set.
There are key items to look for if a new TV is part of your Super Bowl plans.
“The quality of 4-K, in my view, is a really terrific quality considering the type of image quality that you're gonna get out of the sports games you're about to watch,” said Clearwater Best Buy Manager Tom Gray.
While no TV station broadcasts in 4-K, there is plenty of 4-K content out there.
Better sets will boost the Super Bowl picture and make it even better.
“It will take a 1080p high definition signal and it will enhance it to 4-K quality,” said Gray.
Before you buy, have a talk with a specialist about “refresh rate.” Faster is better.
Look for HDR, high dynamic range.
“It is the really terrific enhancement of the picture quality that will really bring out the vividness of the colors,” said Gray.
How big should you go? That depends on your room size, where people will sit and your budget. Deals are out there, so shop around.
WHAT OTHERS ARE CLICKING ON RIGHT NOW:
FRUSTRATED COACH Daryl Powell has warned he will not stay patient with any Castleford Tigers players who continue to under perform.
Last year's Betfred Super League leaders have struggled for consistency this term and Powell made no secret of his dismay after they were thumped 40-18 by St Helens a week ago.
Tigers visit Hull KR in a rearranged game tomorrow and Powell insisted he will not accept another below-par display.
“I am a little bit frustrated with the way we're playing,” he admitted.
“Our consistency is not good enough at the moment.
“We are missing a few players, but there are some teams missing a lot more than us who are more consistent than us in terms of attitude and effort.”
Powell added: “I'm asking for a consistent attitude and effort from the team and hopefully that's going to start to happen.
“If players aren't playing well there needs to be an ability to leave players out.
“That's the nature of a team sport, players need to play well to make sure they keep their place in the team and the team's functioning the way it should.”
A good performance and win tonight would boost Tigers' self-esteem, Powell reckons.
He said: “We know what we're capable of playing-wise.
“The difficulty is when you know you're capable of a certain standard and you're not at it. Confidence can take a bit of a whack.
“We have to grow our confidence in our defence first and foremost and then we've got to build on the back of that.
“It's an important game for us.
“This is our game in hand so we want to be winning this game and continue to get better as we move towards the important part of the season.”
Tigers are fifth in the table, 10 points adrift of leaders St Helens, but Powell insisted they are still right in the race for honours.
“We're not even halfway through the season,” he stressed.
“There are loads of scope for a team to come from nowhere and there's scope for us to hit a good run of form.”
Russia's main intelligence agency said on Monday it has foiled a plot led by two Soviet-born militants fighting for the Islamic State group in Syria.
Four people have been arrested on suspicion of plotting a series of attacks, the FSB said in a statement. That includes two would-be suicide bombers who were supposed to blow themselves up on Moscow's transit system and in a shop. The FSB said they discovered a lab outside Moscow where improvised explosive devices were made.
The intelligence agency said the attacks were directed by two senior militants who fight on the side of IS in Syria and hail from the former Soviet Union.
The suspects arrested outside Moscow were not identified, but the FSB said one of them is a Russian national and three others are from Central Asia. The FSB did not say when the arrests took place.
More than 4,000 Russian nationals, mostly from predominantly Muslim regions, are estimated to fight alongside IS militants in Syria. When Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2015 launched a military operation there to provide air cover for the government's offensive against the IS, he said Russia's involvement was necessary to deter Russians fighting there from coming back home.

2017 could prove a another big year for Witterings-based actor Frankie Oatway with the release of two feature films this summer – and the possibility of a part on EastEnders.
“It has just been so amazing,” Frankie says. “This last year has been so busy.”
Making it all the more remarkable is the fact that it is only relatively recently that Frankie has taken up acting.
“I had very little education and come from a tough background. I served in the parachute regiment for eight years from 17 years old. I'm from Nottingdale, the less ponced-up working-class area of Notting Hill. I was a builder for over 25 years then fell into acting.”
Towards the end of the summer, Frankie is expecting to be on cinema screens with the release of Finding Your Feet: “I play a great part as a London cabbie, working alongside some of the country's finest – Joanna Lumley, Imelda Staunton and Timothy Spall.
“It's a very funny film. I got on famously with Imelda. She was so lovely to work with. It was written Nick Moorcroft and directed by one of the best directors in the country who cast me for the film, Richard Loncrane.”
Frankie has also played another major role in the new British feature film, My Name Is Lenny, based on the bare-knuckle fighter Lenny McLean.
“I was auditioned to play one of the main characters Kenny Mac who was the main influence who introduced the career of bare-knuckle fighting to Lenny when he was in his twenties.
“Kenny was a man's man, a real life Del Boy who ran a second-hand car front and scrapyard from east London where he organised plenty of fights for Lenny with some tough opponents Kenny used to make up an illegal makeshift ring in his scrapyard out of a length of old rope and four gas canisters to resemble the corners of a boxing ring, a real spit-and-sawdust set-up but very effective. There was no shortage of punters. Kenny had them lined up left, right centre for Lenny. As long as Kenny could see a pound note, he would keep Lenny very busy.
“It was a real challenge to play Kenny. Even though I come from that side of life, I took time and studied some of the old documentary footage of Kenny Mac. I found there were some very similar traits we both had. For example, he was a sharp dealer who could think on his feet and put a deal together within a heartbeat. In today's world, I'm sure Kenny could
have been a finance minister or a top money trader. There's no shortage of real people who never get the chance to fulfil their potential, just like Kenny who probably never had the best of chances as a youngster.
“In the film I play alongside Josh Helman from the film X-Men and Mad Max who plays Lenny. Josh was a true professional to work witt. We bounced off each other really well. I also worked closely with Nick Moran from Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels.”
The film also sees what Lenny believes to be the last film appearance from John Hurt, who died earlier this year.
“I met John back in the late 90s when I was a builder. It was while I was doing a conversion on a fitness club in Kensington. I went out to get some tools out my van. I was gutted to discover my tools had been nicked, but who did I happen to bump into? None other than John Hurt doing a bit of shopping. I said ‘Excuse me, mate, you didn't see anyone breaking into my motor, did you?' Then I realised it was John Hurt!”

Tougher IIHS Crash Tests Leave Only 15 Top Safety+ Picks
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has announced its 2018 award winners. Just 15 vehicles qualified for the TOP SAFETY PICK+ award from IIHS, with another 47 earning TOP SAFETY awards, for a total of 62 winners.
Earning the highest "plus" award was tougher this year after requirements were strengthened to put more emphasis on headlight safety and passenger-side protection.
Better Passenger Protection Needed
Surprisingly, this is the first year that a passenger-side crash test has been included to qualify for an IIHS award. The first official passenger-side ratings were released in October, following research tests last year. The Institute said it added the passenger-side "small overlap front crash" test this year after realizing that some manufacturers weren't paying enough attention to the passenger side.
Back in 2012, IIHS began rating vehicles to see how well they protect drivers during small overlap crashes, which involve just the front corner of the vehicle. IIHS said automakers have acted more quickly to improve protection on the driver side than on the passenger side.
"Drivers expect that their passengers, who are often family, will be protected just as well as they are," says IIHS President Adrian Lund. "Manufacturers have been taking this issue seriously since we first shed light on it, and we're confident that good small overlap protection will become the norm on the passenger side, just as it has on the driver side."
Headlight Safety Also Now Key
IIHS explained that its headlight ratings also are relatively new, starting just last year in March 2016. In the beginning, few models performed well in IIHS track tests that measure the tradeoff of how well low beams and high beams illuminate the road, while not producing too much glare for oncoming drivers.
"Headlights have long been treated as design elements instead of the critical safety equipment that they are," Lund says. "We're pleased to see this changing. Every one of the 62 award winners for 2018 is available with headlights that are at least acceptable."
And the Winners Are...
Most of the TOP SAFETY PICK+ awards went to two manufacturers: Hyundai and Subaru. Toyota was also a big winner in the "top" category.
The biggest winner, with six TOP SAFETY PICK+ awards, was Hyundai Motor Co., which also owns Kia and Genesis in addition to Hyundai.
Subaru came in second with four "plus" awards, while Mercedes-Benz earned two. Toyota, BMW, and Ford earned one each.
Overall, Toyota could be viewed as the biggest winner, with 10 vehicles on the TOP SAFETY PICK list. Hyundai was close, with nine.
Subaru also impressed, with all but one of its seven vehicles (the BRZ) earning a TOP SAFETY PICK award. When equipped with optional front crash prevention and specific headlights, the Subaru Impreza, Legacy, Outback and WRX all qualified for the "plus" award, while Subaru's Crosstrek and Forester earn "top" awards.
See below for the full list of winners.
Improvements Coming
Across manufacturers, the vast majority of winners qualified only when optionally equipped because front crash prevention and acceptable or good headlights still are not part of their base packages.
Looking ahead, IIHS said most automakers have pledged to make auto-braking technology standard on virtually all passenger vehicles over the next five years, by 2022. While autobrake is available today, it remains mostly optional, especially on nonluxury brands.
IIHS pointed out that Toyota is an exception and is ahead of the game with its safety features. Almost all Toyota and Lexus models include standard autobrake and other advanced features. Seven models that include autobrake as a standard feature also come standard with acceptable or good headlights, and qualify for TOP SAFETY PICK without any added options. The seven models include the Toyota Camry, Corolla, Prius, Prius Prime, and Highlander, and the Lexus IS and NX.
Sorry Minicars, Size Matters
IIHS summarized the 15 TOP SAFETY PICK+ winners as "four small cars, three midsize cars, five large luxury cars, two midsize nonluxury SUVs, and one midsize luxury SUV."
No minicars, minivans, or pickups earned the highest award. Although models from a wider range of vehicle types earned TOP SAFETY PICK awards, there were no minicars in that category either.
Pushing for Safer Vehicles
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has been recognizing vehicles with TOP SAFETY PICK awards since the 2006 model year to help consumers identify vehicles with the highest safety ratings without having to wade through information about individual tests.
The TOP SAFETY PICK+ accolade was introduced in the 2013 model year, with the "plus" to recognize vehicles that offer a superior level of safety. By adding and strengthening criteria for its top awards, IIHS says it has helped push automakers to implement car safety advances.

LAS VEGAS -- According to sources, the Nevada State Athletic Commission intends to re-evaluate the disciplinary action it took against UFC lightweight champion Conor McGregor in October.
Sources close to the situation informed ESPN.com that McGregor, 28, met with NSAC officials on Tuesday in Las Vegas to discuss his written request for the regulatory body to reconsider its disciplinary order against him.
Per NSAC protocol, sources said, an NSAC chairman has the authority to grant a motion for reconsideration filed by a sanctioned athlete. That motion is then voted on by commission members and, if passed, reopens the case to a new disciplinary hearing.
NSAC chairman Anthony Marnell is expected to grant McGregor's request during the commission's monthly meeting in March.
The NSAC originally fined McGregor $75,000 and ordered him to produce an anti-bullying public service announcement with a production value of a minimum $75,000. He was also ordered to perform 50 hours of community service.
The order stemmed from McGregor's actions during a UFC fight week news conference last August, during which he threw water bottles and drink cans in the direction of his opponent,? Nate Diaz, inside the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino.
At the time of his initial disciplinary hearing in October, McGregor, of Dublin, was primarily focused on avoiding any suspension that would have prevented him from a scheduled lightweight title fight at UFC 205 on Nov. 12 in New York.
Shortly after that hearing, UFC president Dana White publicly stated McGregor had informed him that he never wished to fight in the state of Nevada again. McGregor later told RollingStone.com that he didn't see Nevada in his "foreseeable future."
On Nov. 18, six days after becoming the first fighter in UFC history to hold titles in multiple weight classes, McGregor filed a formal petition for judicial review of the NSAC's order in Nevada District Court. That case remains open for the time being.
The NSAC has undergone changes since McGregor appeared before the commission via conference call in October. Longtime commissioner Pat Lundvall's tenure with the NSAC came to an end in October. Former commissioner Michon Martin is no longer with the NSAC, as well.
It's worth noting that Lundvall made the initial motion to fine McGregor $150,000, which amounted to 5 percent of his $3 million purse to fight Diaz at UFC 202. And during deliberations, Martin suggested an even higher fine amount of $300,000, which was ultimately shot down.
The NSAC's pending decision to reopen McGregor's disciplinary order could have a direct effect on the recent developments regarding a potential megafight between McGregor and retired pound-for-pound boxing great Floyd Mayweather Jr.
In order for that fight to happen in Las Vegas, which is historically Mayweather's preferred location, McGregor would require a professional boxing license. Prior to submitting an application for that license, McGregor would need to settle any outstanding disciplinary orders with the commission.
Diaz was fined $50,000 for his part in the August incident. Diaz initially stood up from the news conference and began to walk out. As McGregor yelled to him from the stage, Diaz tossed a bottle in his direction, which prompted McGregor to return fire. The $50,000 represented 2.5 percent of Diaz's purse.
It's unknown at this time whether Diaz will file a similar request to reopen his disciplinary case with the NSAC, but sources told ESPN.com the commission would likely consider that request as well.
It's rare for an athletic commission to reopen a disciplinary case after a sanction has already been voted on. Most recently, and famously, the NSAC reached a settlement with UFC welterweight Nick Diaz in January 2016. After it initially suspended Diaz for five years, the commission reduced his sentence to 18 months.
LOS ANGELES — In a story March 16 about Alicia Vikander's preparations for the new “Tomb Raider” film, The Associated Press reported erroneously that trainer and nutritionist Magnus Lygdback worked with Gal Gadot on “Wonder Woman.” He is training Gadot for the upcoming sequel, but did not work with the actress on the original film.
A corrected version of the story is below:
Being Lara Croft takes months of training, plates of protein
It took months of training and endless plates of protein to transform former ballerina Alicia Vikander into musclebound badass Lara Croft in the new “Tomb Raider” film
BY SANDY COHEN
AP Entertainment Writer
It took months of training and endless plates of protein to transform former ballerina Alicia Vikander into musclebound action hero Lara Croft for the new “Tomb Raider” film.
The 29-year-old Oscar winner spent seven months working with Swedish trainer and nutritionist Magnus Lygdback, who also helped Ben Affleck get into superhero shape for “Justice League” and is helping Gal Gadot train for the upcoming “Wonder Woman” sequel.
Lygdback and his team of fitness professionals hosted a boot camp in Los Angeles recently to demonstrate Vikander's “Tomb Raider” training regimen.
“Physically, anyone can train being a superhero,” Lygdback said.
Diet is paramount, even more than physical training, he said. He directs his clients to eat every three hours and avoid sugar and “fast carbs” like white rice and flour.
“You'll see a big change, mentally and physically, just by changing the nutrition,” he said.
Vikander spent seven months preparing to become Croft. The first three were just about diet, Lygdback said. His clean-eating plan includes lots of protein and vegetables. A sampling at the “Tomb Raider” boot camp featured broccoli blossoms and seared steak. He says 17 out of 20 meals should be on point, with three splurge meals in the mix.
“I love desserts. I love chocolate. I love a glass of Barolo on a Saturday night,” said Lygdback, whose Hercules-shaped form appears to have zero body fat.
Four months ahead of filming, Vikander began working daily with Lygdback for hour-long sessions incorporating martial arts, weight training and movement education to give her a greater command of her body.
The process didn't just pack muscle onto Vikander's slender frame.
“Magnus really helped me transform for the role,” she said. “And gain a sense of empowerment.”
“Tomb Raider” opens Friday.

MIMS, Fla. (WFLA) – Harry T. Moore and his wife Harriette V. Moore, two little-known pioneers of the civil rights movement, lived in Mims, a tiny town along the space-coast just east of Orlando.
On Christmas Day in 1951, someone placed sticks of dynamite underneath the front porch of their modest shotgun home.
“That was the bomb that was heard around the world,” said Sonya Mallard, the Harry & Harriette Moore Cultural Complex Coordinator. “They told me that people as far as Titusville came running to see what happened, they thought NASA blew up.”
Harry Moore died that day. Harriet passed away nine days later.
Before his untimely death, Harry Moore was the statewide secretary of the NAACP. He routinely registered black voters and spoke out against lynchings, making the couple a target.
“They were the first couple that really took it by the horn. They didn't want to sweep it under the rug,” Mallard said.
Many believe that blast shined a brighter light on the civil rights movement, a movement that greatly affected William Gary.
Gary is the president of the Harry T. and Harry V. Moore Cultural Complex, the board that oversees the Moore Memorial Park & Museum in Mims. He's dedicated the last several years of his life to park, which includes a replica of their home.
Gary wants more people to know about the couple's legacy and the sacrifice they made for freedom.
“The early civil rights movement received a tremendous boost and the interest in their story has just grown by leaps and bounds over the years,” Gary said.
“It's a very emotional thing for me. I grew up in the segregated south in Mississippi, actually in the hotbed of civil rights history. So my ability to get a college education, to be an engineer and work for NASA, is a direct result of things they were fighting for back then,” Gary said.
The museum is open Monday through Thursday from 10 to 7, Fridays, 9-6 and Saturday 10 to 2.

President Donald Trump threatened Iran with "much bigger problems than they have ever had before" if the country restarts its nuclear program The warning comes as the clock ticks down toward Trump's May 12 deadline on whether he will keep U.S. commitments to the nuclear deal and sign waivers for Iran sanctions - or let them snap back into place and possibly destroy the deal.Trump made the comments in the Oval Office alongside French President Emmanuel Macron who is in town for a three-day state visit. Macron and other European allies are in an all-out effort to persuade Trump to stay in the agreement that he bashed again Tuesday as "a terrible deal.""It's insane, it's ridiculous, it should've never been made - but we will be talking about it," Trump said, sitting next to Macron.For his part, Macron tried to downplay the two leaders' differences on the issue: "Iran deal is an important issue. We will discuss that. But we have to take it as a part of a broader picture, which is security in the region.""What we want to do is to contain the Iranian presence in the region, and the JCPOA is part of this broader picture," the French leader added.Trump waived sanctions once again in January, but he warned it was for the last time, calling on European allies to make three fixes to what he sees as the deal's flaws: sanctioning Iran's ballistic missile program, ramping up inspections of Iranian sites, and eliminating expiration dates for the limits on Iran's enrichment levels.Since then, French, German, and British diplomats have been meeting with a State Department team to negotiate a side agreement, although they still have not reached a solution.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani delivered his own threat Tuesday, urging Trump to stay in the deal or face "severe consequences.""I am telling those in the White House that if they do not live up to their commitments, the Iranian government will firmly react," Rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on state television.Trump blasted Iran for destabilizing the region, saying, "Wherever there is trouble... Iran is behind it.""What kind of deal is it where you're allowed to test missiles all over the place? What kind of deal is it when you don't talk about Yemen and you don't talk about all of the other problems with respect to Iran?" he added.
Puebla, Mexico, October 6, 2017 ( venezuelanalysis.com ) – Venezuela has accused the head of the Organization of American States Luis Almagro of discussing new sanctions on Caracas with a top US military official.
On Monday, Almagro met with US Southern Command head Kurt Tidd. The meeting took place on the sidelines of a summit on Latin America organised by Florida Goveror Rick Scott.
The meeting was condemned by Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab, who accused Almagro of discussing the possibility of further US sanctions with Tidd. The Trump administration imposed economic sanctions on Venezuela in August, and has hinted that more could be in the works.
“The secretary general of the Organisation of American States should be a symbol of regional peace, regional diplomacy and regional peace,” Saab said, accusing Almagro of pursuing a political campaign against Venezuela's government.
“More sanctions on Venezuela, not only of an economic nature, are presumably militaristic, warlike, [and] aggressive to our territory,” he said.
Today at #LatinAmericanSummit I had an opportunity to talk to @ADMKurtWTidd about regional issues, especially the situation in Venezuela pic.twitter.com/Uouu2qWFEQ — Luis Almagro (@Almagro_OEA2015) October 2, 2017
Neither Tidd nor Almagro have confirmed whether they specifically discussed sanctions.
Almagro has, however, confirmed he did have a conversation with Tidd.
“Today at #LatinAmericanSummit I had an opportunity to talk to @ADMKurtWTidd about regional issues, especially the situation in Venezuela,” he tweeted on Monday.
On the same day, Almagro publicly called for tougher sanctions on Venezuela. Responding to a question from an audience member at the Latin American Summit, Almagro said Venezuela has "completely abandoned the rule of law," according to EFE.
He also met with House Democrat Joe Kennedy II at the same summit. According to Almagro, they discussed the need to “re-democratise Venezuela”.
Reunión c/ Joe Kennedy II. Compartimos visión sobre necesidad y camino hacia urgente redemocratización d #Venezuela #OEAconVenezuela pic.twitter.com/dnhQh2TQMY — Luis Almagro (@Almagro_OEA2015) October 3, 2017
Tweet reads: Meeting w/ Joe Kennedy II. We share a vision on the necessity and path towards the urgent re-democratisation of #Venezuela #OASWithVenezuela
Almagro has long been a fierce critic of the Maduro administration, and has endorsed unilateral US sanctions on Caracas in the past. Over the past year he spearheaded a campaign to have Venezuela suspended from the OAS, and in a recent report he argued for more economic pressure on the country.
“We reiterate the request we made in the past so that the international community will continue to apply increasingly hard sanctions against the [Venezuelan] regime,” he stated.
Venezuela is currently struggling with its worst economic downturn in decades, and the government warns more sanctions will hurt ordinary Venezuelans.
For one thing, the gameplay feels smoother than ever before, something you'll notice the moment you start a match, pass the ball around and try to score some goals. The players are much easier to control and their general body movement isn't as stiff as in past editions of the game. Pro Evolution Soccer 2018 is still powered by Konami's Fox Engine, which has been featured in franchises like Metal Gear Solid. This time around, though, the company says it wanted to focus on more than simply improving the gameplay. As such, the menus are now much easier to browse and look at, while the new "enhanced visual reality" makes the players closer resemble their real-life appearance.
Usain Bolt in 'Pro Evolution Soccer 2018.'
In what's a marketing plot more than anything, Konami is bringing none other than Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt into PES 2018. What that means is you'll be able to have him on your My Club team, playing alongside Messi, Neymar and the rest of the football stars in the game. Bolt, a Manchester United supporter, has always said he wants to be a pro soccer player, so at least now he'll have that chance in a virtual world. "We wanted to do things differently, a little bit crazy," says Adam Bhatti, the game's product and brand manager. That's the reason Argentina legend Diego Maradona will also be a part of Pro Evolution Soccer 2018.
I don't know if I'll be playing it over my football game of choice, FIFA, as I have done in the past. But, based on the few matches I played here at E3 2017, it's great to see Konami's franchise continuing to get better every year, even if it may not even on the same level as FIFA yet. You can make that call for yourself when Pro Evolution Soccer 2018 arrives September 14th in the US, and a couple days later in Europe. The game is going to be available for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One and PC.

One fun quirk of LeBron James is his decision to go dark on social media for the NBA playoffs. For each of the last few years, James has unofficially kicked off his team's postseason run with Zero Dark Thirty-23, signifying that he's not going to post anything until after he's been knocked out.
But on Tuesday evening, James decided to break with tradition and post something onto social media … kind of. James posted this to his Instagram Story, which looked like a message he was trying to spread to Cavaliers fans.
https://twitter.com/JustRyCole/status/988900955126087680
It's not hard to imagine that James would want to motivate people in Cleveland to keep believing in the team as the Cavs are in the first round fight of their lives against the Indiana Pacers. But soon after, James posted a series of videos that feature a young girl named Kheris Rogers, whose organization Flexin' In My Complexion designs clothing and wants to spread a message of positivity.

By GILLIAN WONG and CHRISTOPHER BODEEN
Associated Press
BEIJING (AP) - President Xi Jinping vowed Tuesday to protect "every inch" of China's territory while promoting "high-quality" economic growth and the resurgence of Chinese culture and creativity as he kicked off his second term, poised to rule indefinitely.
Xi, China's most powerful leader in decades, sounded a strongly worded warning that appeared directed at anyone from advocates of independence in the southern Chinese city of Hong Kong to the government of self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory.
The Chinese people are united in their belief that "every inch of our great motherland absolutely cannot and absolutely will not be separated from China," Xi declared in his speech before the nearly 3,000 members of the National People's Congress.
Attempts to split the country are "doomed to failure," he said.
Xi said the mainland would continue to promote "peaceful unification" with Taiwan. The island's 23 million residents are strongly in favor of maintaining their de-facto independent status.
Xi is set to shape the country's future for the coming decades after the historic legislative session that closed Tuesday abolished presidential term limits to allow him to rule for as long as he wants.
As an indication of what is to come, Xi stressed the absolute leadership of the ruling Communist Party - of which he is head - in all aspects of Chinese life. That authority is central to Xi's vision of a confident, rising China with him at the helm to tackle thorny challenges that include slowing growth, risky excessive borrowing, a possible trade war and other challenges.
Premier Li Keqiang, in a briefing with reporters, also promised to fully open manufacturing industries to foreign competitors and said China doesn't want to see a "trade war" with the United States. He made no mention of a possible Chinese response to any increase in U.S. import controls.
Beijing faces mounting pressure from President Donald Trump over complaints it hampers access to its markets, pressures foreign companies to hand over technology and is flooding foreign markets with unfairly low-priced steel and other goods.
The longer-than-usual, 16-day legislative session had earlier approved a range of new appointments, including that of key Xi ally Wang Qishan as vice president. New ministers were also appointed and a law passed establishing a powerful new anti-corruption body to oversee the party and civil service.
In his address, Xi said China would promote "high-quality" development that values innovation over speed of growth. Xi also invoked China's historical achievements in governance and culture and stressed the importance of national unity as it strove to reach new goals in poverty alleviation and economic development in coming years.
"I believe that as long as the more than 1.3 billion Chinese people ceaselessly carry forward this great creative spirit, we can certainly create one miracle after another," he said.
Xi pledged to expand the Belt and Road, his signature foreign policy initiative of building ports, bridges and railways connecting Europe with Asia - but in an apparent response to the project's critics, said China wasn't seeking hegemony.
"China's development does not pose a threat to any country," Xi said.
"Only those who habitually threaten others will look at everyone else as threats," he added.
This year's session has been dominated by the rubber-stamp body's historic move on March 11 to scrap a constitutional two-term limit on the presidency dating from 1982, enabling Xi to rule indefinitely.
While delegates overwhelmingly supported the move, critics and some analysts say it raises concerns about a return to one-man-rule - and greater political repression within an already highly controlled polity.
"There is a distinct danger now that there may well be a return to the Maoist style of leadership symbolized by the dissolution of collective responsibility and the concentration of power under one person," said Joseph Cheng, a long-time observer of Chinese politics now retired from the City University of Hong Kong.
The broad strokes of what Xi plans to do with these expanded powers were laid down over the weekend as he moved to appoint his trusted allies into key positions that appear, in part, set to further sideline Li, officially China's No. 2 leader.
One of them is Wang, reportedly an early acquaintance of Xi's and former anti-corruption czar who is expected to play a key role in managing trade tensions with the United States. The vice presidency is normally a ceremonial post but Wang's real standing can be seen in official events in which he is seated in eighth place in hierarchical order after the seven-man, all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee.
Another is longtime Xi adviser Liu He, who was appointed as one of four vice premiers and is expected to oversee a broad range of economic and financial issues.
Chief among Xi's priorities is controlling financial risk without derailing the economy. Regulators have been warning about ballooning debt that caused international ratings agencies to cut China's credit rating last year.
"He knows that if there's a financial crisis it will damage his credibility and legitimacy very much because he has no one else to blame," Cheng said. "People will blame him."

In Africa's fashion capital, Lagos, ‘trad is swag'
Lagos, Nigeria | AFP | Leggy dancers in tight shorts, bottles of Moet champagne and flashy cars feature in Nigerian pop icon Wizkid's bling-bling music videos.
But the singer himself has now swapped the Versace T-shirts and low-slung jeans that show his underwear for traditional African dress — a new youth trend in fashion hub Lagos.
Last year, Vogue voted Wizkid “Nigeria's best-dressed pop singer”, a particularly coveted and prestigious title in a country where appearance is all important and competition is fierce.
Clothing that used to be considered only for the old or for people out in the provinces is setting the trend in fashion, from the Yoruba agbada, a large, triple-layered robe worn in the southwest, to the Igbo “Niger Delta” embroidered collarless shirt from the south, and the northern Hausa babariga, a long tunic worn with an embroidered asymmetrical hat.
In recent years, this traditional clothing — or “trad” as it's dubbed — can be seen in offices as well as nightclubs, and at weddings and business meetings.
“It's the in-thing now,” Wizkid told Vogue magazine.
“When I'm back home, all I wear is African fabrics. I get material from different parts of Nigeria — north, west, south — and I mix it up,” said the 26-year-old superstar.
Lack of space in Lagos, a sprawling megacity of 20 million inhabitants, has meant there are few shopping centres and ready-to-wear clothing stores are hard to find.
Economic recession and the free fall of the naira currency has put paid to wealthy Nigerians' shopping sprees in Dubai, Paris and Milan.
Instead, they've had to make do with what's on offer locally, sending the popularity of roadside tailors soaring.
– ‘Trad is swag' –
In 2012, Omobolaji Ademosu, known as B.J., left his job in a bank to set up his own line of men's clothing, Pro7ven.
In two tiny workshops in Ojodu, on the outskirts of Lagos, his dozen employees cut, sew and iron a series of orders to the sound of a diesel generator.
B.J. calls his style “African contemporary”.
His work includes magnificent made-to-measure agbadas with embroidered collars, which can sell for up to 150,000 naira ($475, 420 euros) each.
“Trad is swag,” smiled B.J.
“Any day, I can switch from Yoruba to Igbo to Fulani, I'm rocking it! It's the Lagos spirit, there is no barrier, we are one.”
When attending professional meetings in business and politics, dressing in the ethnic outfit of your host is a sign of respect that can really pay off — or at least win big contracts.
Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari's election campaign in 2015, for example, featured him in a variety of traditional outfits from across the country.
With more than 500 ethnic groups, Nigeria is able to draw from a huge catalogue of fabrics, styles and jewellery.
The beauty of each ethnic look is a source of pride, which has begun to extend beyond Nigeria's borders.
In early May, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, a spokesman for South Africa's Economic Freedom Fighters party, posted a picture of himself on Instagram, dressed in a dark “Niger Delta” outfit, complete with wide-brimmed hat and gemstone necklace.
His numerous and enthusiastic female fans were quick to comment with emoji hearts, affectionately calling him “Igwe” — an Igbo prince.
– Retained ‘African pride' –
“Even in Paris, young people from the diaspora want to present themselves as African princes now,” said Nelly Wandji, owner of MoonLook, an African fashion boutique in the upmarket Rue du Faubourg St-Honore.
“Nigeria is clearly the leader in fashion in terms of style, creativity and number of recognised designers,” she said on a recent visit to Lagos.
“Lagos Fashion Week has dethroned Johannesburg. Nigerians have remained much more authentic, they have retained ‘African pride', whereas South Africa is very Europeanised.”
Wandji, who is French of Cameroonian heritage, said the fashion trend was due to the African diaspora, of which Nigerians were the main ambassadors by sheer weight of numbers.
“Young people from the diaspora are the drivers of African fashion, they have reappropriated their culture and made it trendy because it's seen in Europe or the United States,” she said.
Gloria Odiaka, a petite woman in her 50s, is the successful owner of a luxury traditional fabric shop in Lekki, a well-heeled Lagos neighbourhood.
“The young generation are into native wear and they look gorgeous,” she said.
“My sons study in Canada and when I go visit them they say, ‘Please, Mommy, buy us some trads, I'm done with Canadian T-shirts',” she said with a laugh.

5 helpful tips for juggling work and parenting
Juggling work and parenting might not exactly be the easiest thing to do, but there are a couple of things you can do to make it easier. Jumia Travel, the leading online travel agency, shares 5 tips for juggling work and parenting.
Involve Your Spouse
Involving your spouse can be a great way to ease juggling work and parenting. If you don't have a spouse, involve trusted close friend(s) or relative(s) who is (are) willing to be there for you. The fact is you can't successfully juggle work and parenting on your own. You can communicate with these people and hash out the details of who's going to do what and when, and then agree on it. Communication and a willingness to sacrifice and compromise are vital in making this work.
Get Great Childcare
Good and reliable childcare is better than a thousand gold bars when you're trying to juggle work and parenting. You thus have to do your research very well and find good daycare centers and nannies that you can trust to help look after your child in your absence. However, you should be sure to keep a watchful eye on them to be sure they are taking care of your child or children in the best possible way.
Put Things in Proper Perspective
When managing work and parenting, you need to be able to put things in proper perspective. You should cut yourself some slack and try not to feel bad about having to leave your child or children all the time because in the end you are working to provide a better, easier and more comfortable life for your child or children. At this same time, you shouldn't get carried away and use this as an excuse to be negligent. You must learn to balance the two sides and manage it as well as you can. Be away when you need to be, but be prepared to make sacrifices and compromises to be as present in your child's life as possible. Make the effort.
Learn to Manage Your Commitments
When you're at work, you're at work. Be focused on completing your work and doing it to the best of your ability. When you're at home, be at home and be focused on being the best parent ever to your child. Don't bring home your baggage or issues from work to and dump it on your children to deal with. Even if you can't help but bring home your issues from work, never do it in a way that affects your children. Whenever you're with your children, be committed to being with them, and let nothing else come in between. Manage your commitments.
Know Your Priorities
You need to determine what comes first to you, your work or your children. When you know this, it will be easier for you to make decisions when the two ‘worlds' occasionally clash. Know what's most important to you, and let that guide your decisions during such tight periods. You don't have to be with your child every minute for them to feel loved, but you need to know those few minutes that being with them matters most.
Remember Yourself
A sick, exhausted or drained person can hardly be useful at the workplace and to their child or children. You, therefore, have to remember to take some time to rest and take care of yourself. This way you can continue to be there for your child or children and be productive at work.

In Mexico: Citizens march to protest rise in gasoline prices
The protesters marched Sun along Mexico City's Reforma avenue towards the vast central square called the Zocalo.
Hundreds of irate Mexicans marched in Mexico City to protest a steep rise in gasoline prices.
They carried signs denouncing President Enrique Pena Nieto, whose government announced last week that the price of gasoline would increase by as much as 20 percent to 0.88 dollars per liter on New Year's Day, while diesel would rise by 16.5 percent to 0.83 dollars.
Pena Nieto has promised that fuel prices will eventually fall thanks to a landmark 2014 energy reform he instituted, which ended a seven-decade-old monopoly held by the state-run firm Pemex.
The government plans to end subsidies and let the market dictate prices in March. But Mexicans will feel the pinch at the pump before they start falling.
The protesters marched Sun along Mexico City's Reforma avenue towards the vast central square called the Zocalo.
"With this news about gasoline I don't know how much more we can take," said Dulce Maria Coeta, a homemaker. "Even as it is, the minimum wage is not enough to buy groceries. Now, it will be even worse."
Mexicans flocked to gas stations last week to fill their tanks before the price rise. News reports Sunday said some ran out of fuel.
Pemex said this happened in less than one percent of its service stations.
The protests are the latest headache for Pena Nieto.
His popularity has plummeted below 25 percent this year due to his government's failure to curb drug-related violence, disappointing economic growth and his unpopular decision to host Donald Trump before the anti-immigration Republican won the US presidential election.
The fall in global oil prices in recent years has forced the government to cut its budget and slash spending at Pemex.
And the peso has fallen to historic lows due to Trump's protectionist rhetoric against Mexico.
The liberalization of gasoline prices was supposed to begin in 2018, but the government decided to start it now.

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) – A Florida man has been sentenced to six years and five months in prison for accidentally shooting a gun while taking a selfie in a strip club restroom.
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Tampa announced 34-year-old Rorn Sorn's sentencing Monday. The Asian Pride Gang member pleaded guilty in April to possessing a firearm as a convicted felon.
Court documents say Sorn was at Club Lust in St. Petersburg in December when his gun discharged. The bullet went through the mirror and into the adjacent women's restroom. No injuries were reported.
A security guard approached Sorn as he was leaving, and Sorn reportedly told the guard that it was an accident and that he “was just trying to take a selfie.” Police responded, and officers found a handgun, ammunition and drugs on Sorn.
Sorn has prior felony convictions for burglary and attempted first-degree murder.

This Is How They Got Helen Zille To Apologise
It took one minute and 58 seconds for Helen Zille to read her apology of 212 words on Tuesday, reports HuffPostSA.
Sitting beside Mmusi Maimane at the DA's media conference at the Holiday Inn Rosebank in Johannesburg, the two never once made eye contact.
Zille's apology, regarding her tweets about colonialism, was apparently “the product of hours upon hours of argument and debate, crafted to Maimane's satisfaction and only finalised late the previous night”:
[I]t took four days of shuttle diplomacy between the Marks Building in Cape Town, where Maimane has his parliamentary office, and Wale Street, where the provincial seat of government lies, to broker the truce which led to the chastening of Zille. Concerted efforts to come to an acceptable agreement were relaunched midway through last week, after Zille was suspended by the party's federal executive committee and she had made representations to the leadership, in which she described the process as “a sham” and her as the target of a “vindictive and personal campaign”.
The renewed efforts to convince Zille began on Friday – the day that Zille also appeared before the disciplinary panel for the first time:
Zille remained steadfast that her tweets were taken out of context and that it could be academically and analytically deconstructed. Colonialism was a detestable political system, yes, but it did have side-effects that have proven to be beneficial to the whole of society, was the message from the top of Adderley Street. Maimane was even more adamant: it simply does not matter whether or not an academic analysis holds up to scrutiny. The emotional impact of a view like that, espoused by a leader of the DA, is hugely damaging and is interpreted as racist, was the rebuttal from the corner office on the second floor of the Marks Building.
However, everything changed on Sunday when the Sunday Times published a report “citing internal polling showing the DA's support among black South Africans had almost halved in the two months since the impasse began”.
That just wouldn't do and Zille, according to insiders, was shocked and distraught:
The raw data showing the impact her tweets and her defence of it had on the DA's efforts to take advantage of the African National Congress' internal crises opened the door to an emotive argument: the tweets had hurt people.
Thus, Zille agreed to deliver the apology. The first drafts were circulated for consideration that evening, and work on the text continued for more than 24 hours “until it was finalised just after 10PM on Monday night”.
Dismissing the academic argument, Zille finally “submitted herself to Maimane and dispelled any doubts about whom the leader of the party is”.
Too little, too late? No, her time to move on has arrived.

John Oliver's Take On The French Election Is Pretty Scary
First there was Brexit, then there was the Donald – they say bad things happen in threes, so maybe we're not done.
France's presidential elections are just around the corner, and there's plenty of interest in what's going to happen in the land of the snail eaters.
That's especially true for the rest of Europe, who know that results could have far-reaching consequences for the fate of the EU itself.
Rolling Stone to set up the clip:
Oliver focused on the two frontrunners: 39-year-old former investment banker Emmanuel Macron, a center-left [sic] candidate, and Marine Le Pen, leader of far-right populist party National Front.
Of course there is plenty of French bashing…
If the French can learn one thing from the Brexit and Trump wins, it should be that being too lazy to vote can have disastrous consequences.

Workers install wires on a 'Golden Bridge of Silk Road' structure on a platform outside the National Convention Center, the venue which will hold the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, in Beijing, April 18, 2017. Leaders of 28 countries are set to attend the Chinese summit showcasing President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy plan, but few will hail from major Western countries. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said Tuesday that Vladmir Putin of Russia, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey and Spain's Mariano Rajoy are among those slated to appear next month in Beijing for a summit to discuss Xi's "One Belt, One Road" infrastructure investment program to stitch together the Eurasian continent.

BEIJING (AP) — Leaders of 28 countries are set to attend a Chinese summit next month showcasing President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative, but few will hail from major Western countries.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Tuesday that Vladimir Putin of Russia, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey and Spain's Mariano Rajoy are among those slated to appear next month in Beijing to discuss Xi's "One Belt, One Road" program to stitch together the Eurasian continent with infrastructure investment.
The May 14-15 summit is seen as a measure of China's international prestige at a time when Xi has positioned China as a rising outward-looking regional power, and as questions have arisen over President Donald Trump's commitment to maintaining the United States' traditional global leadership.
Wang said leaders from France and Germany will not attend due to their domestic election schedules, not because they snubbed China.
"This is a positive, cooperative conference, it shouldn't be politicized," Wang told reporters in Beijing, in response to a question asking if China felt insulted by the absence of top leaders from the U.S. and its allies, including Japan, Britain and Australia.
China has sought to frame Xi's vision for the China-led development program as an inclusive, mutually beneficial project rather than a statement of geopolitical ambitions that should arouse Western suspicions. The program aims to build roads, railways, ports and other infrastructure along the ancient Silk Road's maritime and overland routes with close to $100 billion in funding.
The program is closely linked to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, China's version of a global financial institution that faced similar Western skepticism upon its formation last year. In the year since, the bank has succeeded in attracting U.S. allies as members, including Germany, Canada and Britain, although Washington continues to maintain its distance.
Xi unveiled the first outlines of his Belt and Road plan as early as 2013, but the inaugural summit next month will provide the Chinese leader the most high-profile stage so far to deliver a focused pitch to a world audience.
"This is an economic cooperation forum, an international cooperation platform that everyone is paying attention to, supports and hopes to participate in," Wang said, characterizing the summit as an effort to uphold globalization.
Aside from Putin, other Chinese allies including Pakistani President Nawaz Sharif and Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi will attend, as will Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, Wang said. British Finance Minister Philip Hammond will also attend in the place of Prime Minister Theresa May.

Instagram has an advertising problem. We've all learned the signs of an “influencer” and their paid posts: The tagging of a brand out of nowhere, the sudden appearance of a product never mentioned before, and of course hashtags that are clearly and lovingly designed by a marketing department. Even Instagram has had enough, and the company's experimenting with ways of cracking down on paid posts that don't disclose their promotional status.
Influencer disclosure is such a problem that the FTC recently stepped in with a warning about it. So Instagram is testing a tool that “lets” influencers tag brands as a post sponsor, which will put a banner up top marking the post as a paid partnership. Instagram insists that they're just helping influencers be the best they can be, but for influencers this new “feature” is a double-edged sword.
Influencer marketing is tricky in general, not least because the jury's still out on whether it works The whole idea is that the brand just found this incredible advocate for their product on social media and is giving them a bigger bullhorn. But as much as we joke about the internet having something for everybody, the reality of advertising is that it's largely an attempt to get people excited about things that just aren't exciting (diet tea, anyone?). So what's the line between somebody who really thinks this product is amazing stuff, and somebody who's only talking about it because they were sent a case, and perhaps a check to go with it? Even if the influencer is sincere in what they're saying, would they say it if they weren't being catered to, somehow? That's what Instagram (and the FTC) is unsure of.
And then there's the question of accountability. While not clearly marking paid posts as sponsored content is breaking the law, in the end it relies on an honor system; nobody's spending tax dollars to create an Instagram Accountability Task Force, and even the most rosy look at the problem still acknowledges influencers get asked not to disclose by brands. If being an influencer is your job, what's more likely: You stand on your principles, or you take the check?
Influencer marketing works, if it works at all, based on a suspension of disbelief — that the person we're following is a genuine fan, not one paid to be. But if influencers are going to stick around, they'll need to figure out how to reconcile that with the need to be honest with their followers, or Instagram — and others — will do it for them.

If you just celebrated Easter, you might have some stale marshmallow Peeps lying around the house. And if you want to avoid eating those Peeps, they are the perfect material for a science experiment you can do in your own kitchen.
With the help of a ruler and a microwave, you can use leftover Peeps to calculate one of the constants of the universe — the speed of light.
It might sound crazy, but all will be revealed in this video from NPR's science YouTube channel, Skunk Bear. As a bonus, you'll also get to see animated Peeps illustrate the history of the search for the speed of light going back to Galileo.
GENEVA (AP) — The U.N. human rights chief is lashing out at the "refusal" of some at the U.N.'s Human Rights Council to refer to Rohingya Muslims as such, calling it a sign of disrespect for the "terrible violations" they have faced.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein provided an update Wednesday on the plight of the Rohingya in Myanmar, after more than 720,000 fled to neighboring Bangladesh since last August amid a violent security crackdown. He was updating a report from his office that relayed accounts from fleeing Rohingya who said killings, enforced disappearances and house-burnings continue in Myanmar
He reiterated his call for the U.N. Security Council to refer Myanmar to the International Criminal Court.
Many Buddhists in Myanmar — a member of the council — call the Rohingya "Bengalis" and say they migrated illegally from Bangladesh, even though they have lived in the country for generations.

Oshiomhole Talks With Two Sides of His Mouth – PDP
Reacting to comments by former Governor of Edo State in which he said Nigeria would have been endangered if former President Goodluck Jonathan had been allowed to continue, the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked Nigerians to ignore the former governor of Edo State.
It said the ex-governor talked without reservation, adding that the former labour leader had spoken on issues that it claimed were false in the past.
Dayo Adeyeye, the spokesperson for the National Caretaker Committee of the party under the leadership of Senator Ahmed Makarfi, alleged that Oshiomhole had once claimed $6bn was seen in an account of a former government official who served in the Jonathan administration.
He said, “Oshiomhole is known for making unguarded statements and therefore, not worthy of our response.
“But it is better to ask him, why is the APC, which he is praising now, dominated by more than 75 per cent of our members?
“They have won and taken over. But is that why they took the economy into recession? Would Jonathan have done that? The answer is no.
“For more than two years after they assumed the leadership of the country, they have no plan and have no direction. Is that a government?
“Oshiomhole is not a person to be taken seriously. He talks with the two sides of his mouth. So, Nigerians must ignore him.”

Ashley Young Unsure About His Manchester United Future future
Ashley Young insists his hunger for the game remains strong despite admitting uncertainty over his Man Utd future.
The former England international has started only 13 games for United this season and was linked with a move to the Chinese Super League in January and February.
The 31-year-old said: “There was of course, and there is always, speculation and especially when there is a transfer window and you are not playing.
“But I have always said that I want to play as much as possible. What the future holds I am not too sure. I am just concentrating on each game and when the manager calls on me I will give 100 per cent and look to play as well as I can.”
Ashley Young has since made 10 senior appearances since the beginning of February and become a regular in the club's pursuit of Champions League qualification via the Premier League and Europa League.
But with Mourinho planning wholesale changes to his playing squad this summer, Young admits he is yet to discover whether he will be a part of the manager's plans next season.
“I have another year left on my contract and a one-year option after that,” Young told reporters. “So if there is anything there to be discussed, you would have to ask the manager.

Interested in Iran? Add Iran as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Iran news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest
Iran's Foreign Ministry said Monday it will raise the case of a detained British-Iranian woman with the judiciary "out of humanitarian concerns" following a visit by Britain's foreign secretary.
Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi said the final decision on whether to release Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is serving a five-year sentence for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government, rests with the judiciary.
Zaghari-Ratcliffe "is considered an Iranian national and should serve her prison conviction according to the judicial system of Iran," he added.
British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson raised the case during a two-day visit to Iran that concluded Sunday. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a charity worker, was detained in April 2016. Her family has denied the allegations against her.
She is among several dual nationals held in Iran, where the judiciary and security forces are dominated by anti-Western hard-liners. It's unclear whether Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, a relative moderate, can secure her release.
Johnson recently complicated efforts to free her by saying incorrectly that she was training journalists when arrested. He has since apologized.
Britain and Iran have discussed the release of some 400 million pounds ($530 million) held by London, a payment Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi made for Chieftain tanks that were never delivered. The shah abandoned the throne in 1979 and the Islamic Revolution soon installed the clerically overseen system that endures today.
Authorities in London and Tehran deny the payment has any link to Zaghari-Ratcliffe.
However, the United States made a $400 million transfer to Iran in January 2016 when Iran freed Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian and three other Iranian-Americans. That money too involved undelivered military equipment from the shah's era. Some U.S. politicians criticized the transfer, calling it a ransom payment.
NDC hits back at ‘MMD Die Hard': Concentrate on your finished party
National Democratic Congress National Youth Chairperson Charles Kabwita has urged MMD Diehard Youth National Coordinator Gerald Chiluba to concentrate on rebuilding his “defunct” party as opposed to attacking their political consultant Chishimba Kambwili.
And Kabwita says his party will not engage in political violence because they understand the consequences of violence.
In an interview with the Zambian Eye on Monday, Kabwita said Chiluba should be the last person issuing threats to Chishimba Kambwili because as a former COBUSU president he should be doing politics of ideas on how to improve the lives of people in the country.
Chiluba has in the past few weeks been attacking the NDC and their Political consultant Kambwili saying the newly-formed party had nothing for Zambians and was thriving on character assassination without telling Zambians what they would do to improve their lives.
He also warned Kambwili to stop using the MMD as a tool for advancing his narrow political agenda.
But Kabwita said Chiluba should concentrate on MMD which was a finished party and useless to the politics of the country.
“NDC is only three months old. our party has a committee which is in charge of manifestos as am I talking right now the committee is drafting the manifesto for the party and its almost ready so as and when it is ready it shall be made public.
“Gerald should concentrate on rebuilding MMD which is a defunct political party, which is a non-functional political party and which is useless to the politics of Zambia. The fact that we talk about Michael Sata is because we give Michael Sata total respect which the PF has failed to do. For us, Michael Sata is our mentor,” he said.
He said his party will not engage in politics of confrontation.
On the PF, Kabwita said his party was ahead of the ruling party and that they knew their plans of tomorrow because most members of the PF had shifted their allegiance to the NDC.
“The PF is reporting to the NDC. We know what the PF is planning to do tomorrow because the allegiance of most of the members in the PF has shifted to the NDC. We have members of parliament whose allegiance is to the NDC. We have mayors who are working with us, we have councilors pushing the agenda of NDC in their respective wards so when they try to harm our leaders the same people they want to send and harm our leaders are the ones telling us.”

THE first man in the UK to have a double hand transplant got the chance to clap his rugby league heroes on his first visit to Headingley Carnegie Stadium.
Chris King, 57, has been a Leeds Rhinos fan since the 1970s but had never seen a live game until today (Mon April 17) when he was in the crowd at Headingley as the Rhinos clashed with Widnes Vikings.
Mr King, from Rossington in South Yorkshire, lost both hands except his thumbs in an accident involving a metal pressing machine at work four years ago.
After undergoing the complex double hand transplant operation at Leeds General Infirmary last July, Mr King said he had got his life back.
And he told reporters how much he was looking forward to being able to clap when he finally got the chance to watch the Rhinos in action.
The Rhinos got in touch and he was the club's guest of honour at the match on Easter Monday afternoon.
Mr King clapped from the stand when the teams ran on to the pitch. And he was applauded himself at half-time when he went on to the pitch and pulled out the winning ticket for the golden gamble draw.
Mr King said: “It feels absolutely marvellous. It's like all my birthdays have come at once.
“I have got all the shirts but I have never been to a live game.
“My favourite game on the TV was the Yorkshire Cup Final in 1988 when Leeds beat Castleford.”
Mr King can now do a range of tasks, including writing, making a cup of tea and gardening.
There have been around 80 hand transplants around the world, including Mark Cahill – the first British man to have the operation – in 2012.
Consultant plastic surgeon Professor Simon Kay performed the first UK hand transplant on Mark Cahill at LGI and also did Mr King's transplant.

NINETEEN years have passed since former England winger Lee Sharpe left Leeds United, following his controversial move from arch rivals Manchester United.
“I still walk in the local pub and get called a Scummer which is always nice,” laughs Sharpe, who lives in Chapel Allerton. “But it's all a bit of banter.”
Lee Sharpe.
The former winger also admits that three years at the Whites promised more than they delivered with Sharpe making just 37 appearances and scoring six goals.
Yet Leeds now holds a special place in the heart of the winger who deeply hopes the Whites can, at long last, return to the Premier League in which he plied his trade.
Sharpe was just 25 when Howard Wilkinson's Whites splashed out a then joint club record fee of £4.5m to land the winger's services on August 10, 1996. Just one month later, Wilkinson was sacked and replaced by George Graham who the winger says never really planned on utilising him the same way.
Nevertheless, the winger still made 30 appearances in his first season at Leeds – scoring six times – and the first of those goals will live long in the memory. “I think probably my goal against Wimbledon in the Kop end was one of my favourite times,” he recalls.
I am very proud that I was part of a fantastic club with great history and I was fortunate enough to play with some fantastic players. Lee Sharpe
“I took it past Vinnie Jones and then curled it in the top corner with my right foot in front of the Kop end. That was a pretty special moment.”
But in the following pre-season the wide man snapped his cruciate ligament, ruling him out of the entire forthcoming campaign. After making five appearances under Graham the following term, David O'Leary was then brought in as the club's new boss and Sharpe featured just twice before being shipped out on loan to first Sampdoria and then Bradford City whom he joined permanently in March 1999.
But the legacy of a still enjoyable three years at Elland Road lives on with Sharpe who hopes the club's premier support is rewarded with a long-awaited promotion.
“Obviously I was a little bit disappointed that it didn't work out quite the way I wanted it to at Leeds,” said Sharpe.
Lee Sharpe at the McDonald's and FA Community Football Day.
“The change in managers didn't help with George Graham and him being so defensive minded. Then I snapped my cruciate in the last pre-season game and had a year out, so that was a bit of a killer. Once I came back, George didn't want to seem to play me and even David O'Leary didn't want to play me either so it was a bit of a difficult time really.
“But I am very proud that I was part of a fantastic club with great history and I was fortunate enough to play with some fantastic players, and I made some really good friends.
“I still live in the area so I still love the place. I loved the fans who were fantastic considering it was such a risky move coming from Man United to Leeds United. There are not many players who do it and I think the fans were really good with me to be fair, apart from a handful that gave me a bit of stick. But I love it over here, I love Yorkshire and I love Leeds people.”
Sharpe initially remained living in Manchester for the first nine months of his time at Leeds but made the switch after endless weeks of frustrating travel.
He laughed: “The M62 was doing my head in so I moved over in '97 and I have been there ever since.”
After eventually leaving for Bradford, spells at Portsmouth, Exeter City, Icelandic club Grindavik and then non-league Garforth Town followed before the former footballer started appearing on TV screens in a different capacity with appearances on shows such as Dancing On Ice and Celebrity Love Island. These days Sharpe is an occasional after-dinner speaker who is also about to release a coaching football app.
The ex-White and his partner, Lucie Gardner, became engaged last March when Sharpe proposed on Ladies' Day at the Cheltenham Festival.
The couple will be married in Italy next summer and have two young children, five-month old Lily and 18-month old Leo.
But the million-dollar question is, will they be encouraged to support Manchester United or Leeds? Sharpe laughed: “That's been taken out of hands. My missus is from Cheltenham and my missus' dad is a Tottenham fan so he's said as grandad can we make him a Tottenham fan so we can take him to the Spurs games when he gets older. It saves me a decision to have to make. But who knows, he will get brought up in Leeds so once he starts going to school and getting put under a bit of pressure he might end up putting a Leeds shirt on...”
Lee Sharpe was speaking at the McDonald's & Lancashire FA Community Football Day in Astley. These football days are taking place across the UK this summer, giving thousands of children the chance to enjoy the game. www.mcdonalds.co.uk/communityfootballdays

Emirates Airline is launching services to Santiago de Chile, the Dubai-based carrier's fourth South American passenger route, starting July 8.
The 5X-weekly service will use a two-class Boeing 777-200LR, which offers 38 business-class seats in a 2-2-2 configuration and 264 seats in economy class.
The new service is routed via Sao Paulo-Guarulhos airport (Brazil) and complements an existing daily Airbus A380 flight between Dubai and São Paulo. In total, Emirates will operate 12X-weekly services to São Paulo.
Emirates president Tim Clark said the start of the Chile operations “underlines our commitment to South America with our fourth destination on the continent and another five flights to São Paulo.”
Emirates is also adjusting its North American network and will introduce a new nonstop service between Newark Liberty International Airport (New Jersey) and Dubai from June 1, adding to its existing daily flight that will have a stop in Athens (Greece).
The new nonstop service will use a Boeing 777-300ER, which offers eight first-class suites, 42 business-class seats and 306 economy-class seats.
However, Emirates will reduce New York JFK services from March 25 to three daily flights—two nonstop flights to Dubai and one via Milan (Italy). Also from March 25, Emirates will add two flights a week each to Fort Lauderdale and Orlando (Florida), effectively returning to daily services at both airports.

LONDON (AP) — Bournemouth sprung a huge surprise by beating Chelsea 3-0 away in the Premier League on Wednesday thanks to three goals in a 16-minute spell in the second half.
Callum Wilson, Junior Stanislas and former Chelsea player Nathan Ake scored the goals to condemn the hosts to a first loss at Stamford Bridge in all competitions since September.
Chelsea dropped to fourth place, behind Liverpool on goal difference, and is in a real fight to qualify for the Champions League a season after winning the Premier League by seven points.
Just a week ago, Chelsea was also eliminated from the League Cup by Arsenal in the semifinals and Antonio Conte's second season in charge is proving much tougher than his first.
After Tiemoue Bakayoko lost possession, Wilson exchanged a one-two and swept home his finish for the opening goal in the 51st minute.
Wilson set up Stanislas for the second goal in the 64th, and Ake scored from close range three minutes later.
What We Know About ‘Teardrop', The Dangerous Woman Scamming Drivers Around Cape Town
Depending on the area, warning posts trickle through Facebook and WhatsApp groups, sharing with communities the most recent sightings of a dangerous woman that has become notorious in certain areas:
“”TEARDROP” at top of Military Rd Steenberg!” “Soooo…I thought “Teardrop” was supposed to be “banished” from the area, under threat of arrest – but no, she was at the Main Road/Atlantic intersection and got picked up by a taxi!” “Teardrop in Checkers parking area….” “Teardrop is outside my shop in kirstenhof. Who so I phone?”
After a reader reached out to us, asking if we knew anything about the woman, we did some digging. Turns out there's plenty about her online, and her modus operandi goes a little something like this:
Targeting unsuspecting drivers (usually male, usually alone), she requests lifts. Once the caring individual has started driving, she tends to make small talk before demanding money. If denied, she even goes so far as to threaten to accuse the driver of rape.
If she approaches you in shopping centres, she will physically assault individuals and make huge scenes if denied money.
She has been spotted in areas as far south as Kommetjie, and between Muizenberg and Hout Bay. The bottom of Ou Kaapse Weg and Military Road intersection are two favourite spots.
Oh, and she is easily identified by a teardrop tattoo on her face, hence the name “Teardrop”:
And some more shots of her in action:
A Facebook post by Kelly Kisten gave some more details:
I'M SHARING THIS BECAUSE I PERSONALLY SEE THIS GIRL BUSY OUTSIDE OUR SHOP ON DIEP RIVER MAIN ROAD.. SCAREY SHIT.. Please be aware that there is a lady who has moved to the Constantia Nek area, requesting lifts and hitchhiking, preying on caring individuals. She is well known to the Noordehoek and Tokai community, and is easily identified by a teardrop tattoo… Well known to the police, various agencies have attempted to assist her to get on the right track to no avail. This is purely to ensure the Hout Bay community is aware of her intentions, as she has caused a considerable amount of trauma to many individuals on the other side of the mountain.shes everywhere plz be extra carefull picking her up.shes dangerous… …victims have noted that they were followed by someone who then picked her up where ever she was dropped off, this driver acts as her ‘getaway' car but also had been involved in malicious activities claiming to have witnessed an attempted rape or assisting in the assault. This woman is dangerous.
If you have yet to encounter Teardrop, count yourself lucky. Otherwise, be vigilant.
As much as this woman needs help, it's really difficult to give it if she doesn't want it.

Last week, Iowa's new Governor Kim Reynolds and new Lt. Governor Adam Gregg stopped in Jones County to visit with folks at Maquoketa Valley Electric Cooperative.
This isn't Reynolds' first visit to MVEC.
“Her office requested the visit as part of her 99-county tour,” explained MVEC CEO Jim Lauzon. “She wanted to hear more about what we are doing.”

PHILADELPHIA -- After the trade that brought cornerback Ronald Darby to the Eagles, the team is without question better at cornerback heading into this season.
They are also, however, without question worse at receiver after losing Jordan Matthews.
Although some like to diminish Matthews' accomplishments because he lined up in the slot and not on the outside, he was still the Eagles' most consistent, productive receiver on the roster -- yes, even more than Alshon Jeffery.
Now, with Matthews gone, the Eagles' receivers look something like this -- Jeffery and a whole bunch of either unproven players, players that have already been labeled a bust or players who the best days might be behind them.
So what does the team's receiver position look like now with Matthews gone -- and are they still a unit that many assumed would help take quarterback Carson Wentz a step forward next season?

Five things we learned in the Premier League
London, United Kingdom | AFP |
Premier League leaders Chelsea registered a record-equalling 13th straight win over the New Year weekend, while Pep Guardiola's Manchester City slipped out of the top four after losing at Liverpool.
Here are five things we learned:
A fitting way to win on Sir Alex's 75th birthday! #MUFC pic.twitter.com/N1zvWC4zeH — Manchester United (@ManUtd) December 31, 2016
United's never-say-die spirit intact
Alex Ferguson spent his 75th birthday watching Manchester United play Middlesbrough at Old Trafford and his former side produced a fitting tribute to their old mentor. United specialised in last-gasp comebacks in the Ferguson era and they pulled off another against Boro, coming back from 1-0 down to win 2-1 through late goals by Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba. Both players had earlier been thwarted by the woodwork, but they stuck to their task to keep United in touch with the leading pack. The victory also suggested that unlike in the grim final months of his Chelsea tenure last season, Jose Mourinho's players are determined to produce the goods for their manager.
Chelsea made of stern stuff
If Saturday's gritty 4-2 win over Stoke City proved one thing, it's that Chelsea are unlikely to crack under pressure when the title race heats up in the new year. On the brink of a record-equalling feat, Antonio Conte's side were given a stern examination by Stoke and rose to the challenge in impressive style. Twice Chelsea were pegged back by the visitors after they had gone ahead through goals from Gary Cahill and Willian. But the Blues didn't flinch as Willian struck again before Diego Costa wrapped up his team's 13th successive league win, equalling Arsenal's single-season record and maintaining their six-point lead at the top. Conte says he is only concerned by trophies rather than records, but on current form Chelsea might well reward him with both.
This could be Giroud's year
Any hangovers among the 60,000 fans at the Emirates Stadium were quickly forgotten as Olivier Giroud produced one of the goals of the season in Arsenal's 2-0 New Year's Day win over Crystal Palace. Giroud endured a difficult 2016 which saw him left out of Arsenal's starting line-up for long periods, as manager Arsene Wenger preferred Alexis Sanchez in the central striker's role. But he remains a potent force on his day and he may have convinced Wenger not to splash out on a replacement in the January sales when he launched himself into an astonishing mid-air, backheeled volley that gave Arsenal the lead in the 17th minute. Giroud's seventh goal of the season will rank among Arsenal's greatest strikes of all time and gave the France striker and his manager renewed hope of a year to remember.
Tottenham are back
A recent return of two wins from eight league games suggested Tottenham Hotspur would struggle to match their feats from last season, when they were the closest challengers to champions Leicester City. But they have stormed back to win four games on the spin, which has catapulted Mauricio Pochettino's side into the top four. Their two most recent wins — 4-1 at Southampton and 4-1 at Watford — have showcased Spurs at their best, with Harry Kane on target three times and Dele Alli scoring four.
City not yet a Guardiola team
Pep Guardiola wasted little time making an impression at Manchester City, clearing the deadwood from his squad and instilling his trademark possession-focused philosophy. But with his side 10 points adrift of leaders Chelsea at the season's halfway stage and outside the Champions League places, he has not yet had the impact people expected. Guardiola's great Barcelona and Bayern Munich teams pummelled their opponents into submission, but City have struggled to impose themselves at times and registered just two shots on target during Saturday's meek 1-0 defeat at Liverpool. They also have big problems in defence. Barcelona conceded an average of 27.25 goals per season under Guardiola and Bayern just 19.3, but City have let in 21 already and kept only four clean sheets.

Nigerians Should Look For Buhari In Their Wardrobes – British Politician, Eric Joyce
A British politician and former military officer, Eric Stuart Joyce, has again stirred up controversy over the health of President Muhammadu Buhari.
Joyce, who insisted that Buhari is dead , asked Nigerians To Look for President Buhari in wardrobes to ascertain if he is truly alive or dead.
Writing on his website, he said: “Nigeria has an extremely capable acting president, of course, but if Mr Buhari is declared dead or permanently incapacitated then it will be the second time in succession that a Northern Muslim president has died and been replaced by his Southern Christian deputy. This is a challenge in a country whose democracy is based upon a complex balance of different regional and religious interests.
“However, it is a challenge Nigeria is most certainly up to give the great success which was the peaceful handing over of power after the last election.
“And so, a top tip for Nigerians. Insist that, like most democracies, it is a strict requirement of being president that your people know exactly what your physical condition is at all times. This practice is not historically confined to democracies, of course. Kings of old were routinely watched in their bedchambers; Queens were watched as they gave birth to heirs. This was all to ensure that things were as they seemed. Requiring a president to show he is capable of running his country, and is definitely not dead, is a simple and practical extension of this.
“For now, with no sight nor sound of the president and no proof even of life for some time, it seems that in a bid to manage the succession the presidency may be lying to the public about the presidents health or even life, and making Nigeria's democratic status a mockery into the bargain.
The Nigerian media seems to be unconcerned about all of this; unconcerned that he may be dead; unconcerned that if he is alive then he may be too ill to carry on. In the absence of serious newspaper and TV media, then, it is left to social media to do the job. So here we are.
“We recommend that every Nigerian check their own wardrobes for Mr Buhari, and perhaps ask their children if they have any ideas. If you do this, you will have looked harder for him than the Nigerian media.”

A man suffered serious injuries in a “one punch” attack which caused him to strike his head on a kerb.
Victim Callum Lester, who was hospitalised for eight days after suffering bruising on the brain, cannot remember the incident, Preston Crown Court was told.
But during a victim impact statement he spoke of suffering nightmares about violence.
His attacker, Henry Hacking, 19, who had consumed nine lagers and several shots, pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm after the attack in an alley near Preston's Evoque nightclub last July.
Hacking, of Roddlesworth Lane, Withnell, Chorley, must do 200 hours unpaid work.
Judge Robert Altham suspended his 13 month jail term for two years after hearing he was a man of good character and was remorseful.
He said: “I am told you are capable of being a hardworking, polite man.
“What is absolutely clear is in the early hours of July 15 you were anything but, because you have pleaded guilty to the serious offence for which you are now to be sentenced.
“During the course of that night you caused serious injury to your victim by punching him, causing him to fall to the ground and land heavily, causing him really serious injuries to his brain.”
“It's not at all uncommon for people, when they are the recipient of a single punch, to fall to the ground bang their head - it happens alarmingly frequently. It also happens far less frequently that when a person is a recipient of a single blow, they fall to the ground and hit their head, and they die.
“That is the risk you take with somebody else's health when you decide unlawfully to punch someone in the face.”
Referring to Mr Lester's impact statement he added: “It makes very difficult reading. It's plainly affected every single aspect of his life.”
David Clarke, prosecuting, said nearby bar staff and members of public saw Mr Lester punched to the ground, and a golf ball sized lump appeared on his head as he lay in a pool of blood.
A scan showed bruising to his brain and a scalp injury.
SYDNEY (AP) — New coach Bert van Marwijk is confident Australia can qualify from its soccer World Cup group stage and says he will have the team play his style to get there.
A few hours after arriving in Sydney on Thursday, the Dutch coach said at a media conference that there was nothing wrong with the philosophy of his predecessor, Ange Postecoglou, but said he is a "realistic coach" who will do what it takes to win.
Postecoglou was criticized at times for persevering with a three-man defensive system, and for Australia's lack of finish in front of goal in Asian qualifying when missed opportunities forced them into the difficult playoff route to Russia.
He quit as coach in November a week after leading Australia to a two-legged intercontinental playoff win over Honduras.
"I have respect for the former coach, (but) I do it in my way," van Marwijk said. "I go to the World Cup with only one thing that counts, (and that's) to survive the first round.
Australia will play in Group C at the World Cup with France, Denmark and Peru.
"I'm a realistic coach," van Marwijk said. "I like creative football, I like to have the ball, but I also like to win — that is the most important thing."
Van Marwijk said his biggest challenge was the short time frame he had to familiarize himself with the current players before the World Cup begins in June.
The 65-year-old will have only the international window in March, when Australia play Norway and Colombia in Europe, and perhaps a farewell friendly in Australia.
"I have to get to know the players very well in a very short time," he said. "That makes the challenge for me even greater."
Van Marwijk, who led Saudi Arabia to direct qualification from Australia's group as an opposition coach, saw physicality as the Socceroos' main strength.
"They are strong, physically strong," he said. "The challenge is to let them play in a way that gives them a chance to win games."
Paleontologists from Bulgaria and Macedonia are excavating the fossilized remains of a prehistoric elephant believed to pre-date the mammoth, after its bones were discovered accidentally by a man working in a field.
Scientists at the Natural Science Museum of Macedonia and the Natural History Museum of Sofia said Tuesday they began excavating the skeleton in Dolni Disan in central Macedonia last Friday. They estimated the animal would have weighed about 10 tons and have been about 50 years old at the time of its death, roughly 8 million years ago during the Miocene epoch.
Biljana Garevska of the Natural Science Museum in Skopje said the fossil was of one of the elephant's ancestors which roamed the region at a time when it was covered by African-like savannah.
TAIPEI (Taiwan News) -- European and U.S. weather centers are predicting typhoons will be forming near Taiwan next week, with the European model predicting twin cyclones could interact with each other and bring heavy rains to Taiwan.
The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model predicts that Taiwan will be affected by two typhoons, one to its northeast and one to its southwest from June 8 to June 13. This may lead to the Fujiwhara effect in which the two cyclones feed each other and touch off massive southwestern monsoon rains in Taiwan.
In some cases wir the Fujiwhara effect, if the two cyclones are close enough, they can merge together to form an even larger typhoon. Based on the early European model, Taiwan would be in between the two typhoons, thus whether the two merge or just draw nearer to each other, Taiwan wil bear the brunt of the effects in the form of heavy rains and strong winds.
The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) predicts that a typhoon will form off of Guangdong on June 6 and then work its way up the coast of Fujian Province. The U.S. model predicts that this will generate a powerful southwest monsoon system that would pack a big punch and bring heavy rain to Taiwan.
Taiwanese meteorologist Wu Der-rong (吳德榮) said that because the weather simulations of the Europe, U.S. and Taiwan differ greatly at this stage, therefore more time is needed to observe conditions and it is too early to rush to conclusions.
Facebook weather site look.weather.typhoon (觀氣象看天氣), whether or not typhoons form or plum rains approach, there should be a significant increase in precipitation between June 8 and June 13.

LONDON — In the latest in a series of gestures toward modernization that would once have seemed improbable, Saudi Arabia announced on Monday that it would allow commercial movie theaters to open for the first time in more than 35 years.
The moves to allow access by early 2018, part of a broad campaign by the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to transform Saudi society, followed measures like giving women the right to drive and to attend soccer games, and allowing concerts and other forms of public entertainment.
At the same time, the crown prince has embarked on a broad drive against corruption, holding members of the Saudi elite in a luxury hotel, in what has been described as an effort to force them to repay billions of dollars diverted into personal coffers from other transactions. Critics say the detentions were intended to neutralize potential challengers.
The announcement on Monday is in keeping with a promise by the 32-year-old crown prince to return Saudi Arabia to a more tolerant version of Islam than the radical interpretation of the Muslim faith it adopted in 1979.

In a statement, the Culture and Information Ministry said the government would begin within 90 days licensing movie houses to open. It did not indicate what kind of movies the government might allow to be screened, but made clear that films would be governed by Islamic law.
CINCINNATI (AP) — The prosecution has rested after testimony from a deputy coroner in the Ohio murder retrial of a former University of Cincinnati police officer.
Dr. Karen Looman of the Hamilton County coroner's office said Wednesday that Sam DuBose died instantly from a bullet fired into his head at a downward angle. Defendant Ray Tensing looked down and away as graphic autopsy photos were shown.
Under defense questioning, she said the 43-year-old DuBose wasn't healthy. She was blocked by prosecution objections from giving details about DuBose's medical condition.
The defense will begin Thursday, with Tensing expected to testify later.
Tensing, who's white, is on trial in the 2015 fatal traffic-stop shooting of DuBose, an unarmed black motorist. He claims he feared for his life.
His November trial ended in a hung jury.

WASHINGTON — In an order that undercuts federal protections for LGBT people, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a sweeping directive to agencies Friday to do as much as possible to accommodate those who claim their religious freedoms are being violated.
The guidance, an attempt to deliver on President Donald Trump's pledge to his evangelical supporters that he would protect religious liberties, effectively lifts a burden from religious objectors to prove that their beliefs about marriage or other topics are sincerely held.
Under the new policy, a claim of a violation of religious freedom would be enough to override many anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people, women and others. The guidelines are so sweeping that experts on religious liberty are calling them a legal powder-keg that could prompt wide-ranging lawsuits against the government.
“This is putting the world on notice: You better take these claims seriously,” said Robin Fretwell Wilson, a law professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “This is a signal to the rest of these agencies to rethink the protections they have put in place on sexual orientation and gender identity.”
Trump announced plans for the directive last May in a Rose Garden ceremony where he was surrounded by religious leaders. Since then, religious conservatives have anxiously awaited the Justice Department guidance, hoping for greatly strengthened protections for their beliefs amid the rapid acceptance of LGBT rights. Religious liberty experts said they would have to see how the guidance would be applied by individual agencies, both in crafting regulations and deciding how to enforce them. But experts said the directive clearly tilted the balance very far in favour of people of faith who do not want to recognize same-sex marriage.
“Except in the narrowest circumstances, no one should be forced to choose between living out his or her faith and complying with the law,” Sessions wrote. “To the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, religious observance and practice should be reasonably accommodated in all government activity.”
The document lays the groundwork for legal positions that the Trump administration intends to take in future religious freedom cases, envisioning sweeping protections for faith-based beliefs and practices in private workplaces, at government jobs and even in prisons.
In issuing the memo, Sessions, a deeply devout Methodist from Alabama, is injecting the department into a thicket of highly charged legal questions that have repeatedly reached the U.S. Supreme Court, most notably in the 2014 Hobby Lobby case that said corporations with religious objections could opt out of a health law requirement to cover contraceptives for women.
The memo makes clear the Justice Department's support of that opinion in noting that the primary religious freedom law — the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 — protects the rights not only of people to worship as they choose but also of corporations, companies and private firms.
The document also says the government improperly infringes on individuals' religious liberty by banning an aspect of their practice or by forcing them to take an action that contradicts their faith. As an example, Justice Department lawyers say government efforts to require employers to provide contraceptives to their workers “substantially burdens their religious practice.”
The document also calls into question the Johnson Amendment, which bars churches and tax-exempt groups from endorsing political candidates. Trump in May signed an executive order aimed at weakening the enforcement of that law, which he has said penalizes people for protected religious belief.
The Justice Department, in the document, says the Internal Revenue Service may not enforce the Johnson Amendment “against a religious non-profit organization under circumstances in which it would not enforce the amendment against a secular non-profit organization.”
The department's civil rights division will now be involved in reviewing all agency actions to make sure they don't conflict with federal law regarding religious liberty.

Zoll reported from New York.
An online crowdsourcing campaign is underway to identify demonstrators who attended white nationalist rallies in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend.
The campaign, led by a Twitter account, @YesYoureRacist, asks people on social media to identify white nationalists who appear in news photos of "Unite the Right" rallies. It's been credited with outing a University of Nevada student, who acknowledges attending a rally in Charlottesville Friday night but maintains he is not a racist.
"I did not expect the photo to be shared as much as it was. I understand the photo has a very negative connotation," Peter Cvjetanovic told CNN affiliate KTVN. "But I hope that the people sharing the photo are willing to listen that I'm not the angry racist they see in that photo."
The @YesYoureRacist account began tweeting pictures of demonstrators on Saturday, asking, "If you recognize any of the Nazis marching in #Charlottesville, send me their names/profiles and I'll make them famous."
Social media users have been identifying demonstrators and tweeting their names to the account. @YesYoureRacist then tries to corroborate the names with pictures from demonstrators' social media accounts.
Logan Smith, who runs the @YesYoureRacist account, told CNN he's been overwhelmed by the response and the number of people willing to help. The account's Twitter following swelled from 65,000 followers before the weekend to more than 300,000 followers by Monday afternoon.
Smith, who works for Progress North Carolina, a left-leaning nonprofit, says he runs the account in his spare time and first set it up in 2012.
"It originated as basically almost kind of comedy account where I would search for people tweeting the phrase, "I'm not racist but," and then would go on to say something completely racist," he told CNN on Monday.
"As the years have gone on the mission has kind of evolved somewhat," added Smith, whose employer is not affiliated with the Twitter account. "I think the situation with race in America has deteriorated, especially with the election of Donald Trump."
Nevada student in spotlight
One of those identified in Charlottesville as a result of Smith's efforts was Cvjetanovic, 20, a student at the University of Nevada in Reno.
In an interview with CNN affiliate KTVN, Cvjetanovic acknowledged he attended the rally to protest the city's planned removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee.
"I came to this march for the message that white European culture has a right to be here just like every other culture," Cvjetanovic said. "It is not perfect. There are flaws to it, of course. However I do believe that the replacement of the statue will be the slow replacement of white heritage within the United States and the people who fought and defended and built their homeland. Robert E Lee is a great example of that. He wasn't a perfect man, but I want to honor and respect what he stood for during his time."
In a statement, the University of Nevada acknowledged that one of its students had been identified as one of the "Unite the Right" marchers, although the school didn't name the student.
"Racism and white supremacist movements have a corrosive effect on our society. These movements do not represent our values as a university," the university's president Marc A. Johnson said in the statement.
Cvjetanovic told KRNV, another CNN affiliate, that he had received multiple death threats since being identified online. He condemned the man who drove a car into a crowd of counterprotesters in Charlottesville Saturday, killing a woman.
"It was a huge tragedy," he told KRNV upon returning to Reno from Virginia. I didn't go to see anyone hurt, and especially anyone killed."
Cvjetanovic maintained that people like himself just want to preserve their culture and bear no ill will towards minority groups.
A photo appearing to show Cvjetanovic posing in a small group of people with US Sen. Dean Heller, a Republican from Nevada, also is being shared widely online. Heller responded to the undated photo Saturday on Twitter, saying, "I don't know this person & condemn the outrageous racism, hatred and violence. It's unacceptable & shameful. No room for it in this country."
'These are your neighbors'
Publishing another person's private information, such as a Social Security number or home address, is a violation of Twitter's rules. But the rules do not appear to apply to individuals' names, according to the social media platform's policy page.
In his interview with CNN Smith defended his efforts to identify the Charlottesville demonstrators.
"I started seeing all of these photos from the torch march on Friday night and then the tragic events of Saturday. What struck me most was that these people aren't afraid anymore. They are not hiding behind their hoods," he said.
"If they are that proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with KKK members and neo-Nazis, I think they should be out there in the open and have their names known. These are not just random faces in an angry crowd. These are your neighbors, your co-workers, maybe even your friends."
Smith said he was sorry to hear that Cvjetanovic has received death threats and added that he and his family were also the target of death threats over the weekend.
Bryan Habana, the lightning-fast South Africa wing and World Cup winner with an insatiable hunger for scoring tries — a record 67 for the Springboks — announced Tuesday he will retire from rugby at the end of the season.
The 34-year-old Habana, who played 124 tests for South Africa and whose try tally is the second-most by a player in international rugby, made the announcement on his Twitter and Instagram accounts.
Habana wrote that he would officially retire at the end of the season but conceded that after battling a knee injury for over a year he probably won't get the chance to play one more time for his French club Toulon.
"It's been more than a year of hoping, trying, pushing and willing to get back on the field for one last time, to taste the sweet victory or encounter that gut-wrenching despair," Habana wrote on his social media post. "To hear the roar of the crowd or grab the pill out of the air. To make that last bone crunching tackle or score that last game winning try.
"But it's unfortunately just not to be. I, like most, would have liked my career to have ended differently, but sometimes things don't turn out quite the way we hope for."
Habana continued: "So at the end of this season, it's time to say goodbye and thank you to the game I so dearly love."
Despite not being able to finish the way he wanted, Habana won just about everything a South African could: The World Cup, a Tri-Nations title and a series against the British and Irish Lions with the Springboks. At club level in South Africa, he collected two Super Rugby titles and two Currie Cups and, in Europe, the Heineken Cup and France's Top 14 league title with Toulon.
He was a world player of the year in 2007, the year he won the World Cup with the Springboks.
Habana's career was in many ways defined by the number of tries he scored: His national record of 67 for the Boks is the most by any player from a top-tier nation and second only to Japanese winger Daisuke Ohata's 69.
He scored a try on his test debut against England at Twickenham and also in his 124th and last test against Italy in Florence in 2016. Ironically, both games ended up being losses for South Africa. But in between them, Habana's lethal finishing helped the Springboks to win the 2007 World Cup, the 2009 southern hemisphere title, and a 2009 series over the Lions.
To Kalon: The Importance of Place
One of Napa's Legendary Vineyards Yields Wines of Depth and Complexity
There are few vineyards in California—or anywhere else on the planet—with the importance and impact of To Kalon in the Napa Valley. The site was first planted in 1868 by Hamilton Walker Crabb, who purchased 240 acres close to the Napa River and named the property for a Greek expression meaning “the place of the highest beauty.” In recent years it has been most closely associated with Robert Mondavi, who chose the vineyard as the home base of his winery in 1966 and said that it had “a feeling that was almost mystical.”
Mystical or not, the vineyard has been a source of controversy. Crabb purchased additional acreage in 1881, swelling the size of To Kalon to 359 acres, and over time the land belonged to many different owners. In 1993 Andy Beckstoffer purchased 93 acres from Beaulieu Vineyards. Beckstoffer was a grower, not a winemaker, and sought to increase the price of his grapes by insisting that his customers label their wine as a vineyard-designated To Kalon bottling; the Mondavis balked, believing that they held a trademark on the use of the name. A series of lawsuits followed, which were settled out of court in 2003.
Today, the Mondavi holdings in To Kalon include the H Block (source of fruit for the Reserve Cabernet, Oakville District Cabernet and Reserve Fumé Blanc), the Block (planted to Sauvignon Blanc in the 1940s), and the T Block (sometimes referred to as Robert's Block, planted to Sauvignon Blanc in 1960). Several large parcels are owned or leased by Opus One, and they provide fruit for the Mondavi-Rothschild joint venture. It's fair to say that the To Kalon wines are the purest expression of the Mondavi style, and probably the closest in spirit to the original concept of the Robert Mondavi estate.
The origin of the term Fumé Blanc is an interesting footnote in the history of wine. To this day, many beginning wine drinkers ask about the difference between Fumé Blanc and Sauvignon Blanc. In fact, they are one and the same. California wine had a poor reputation prior to the Paris tasting of 1976, and Sauvignon Blanc was particularly held in low esteem by American consumers. Robert Mondavi coined the term Fumé Blanc with the 1968 vintage. The name echoed the popular Pouilly-Fumé of the Loire Valley, and Mondavi reasoned that Americans would think more highly of it if they regarded it as French. It was a brilliant marketing ploy, and it worked.
The nose of Mondavi's 2015 Fumé Blanc Reserve from the To Kalon Vineyard ($53) is ripe and round, with aromas of pear, melon and minerals. On entry, the wine is brighter and more aggressive that the nose would suggest, with vibrant acidity and resonant flavors of grapefruit, lemon peel and stone fruit. It gains in depth and complexity the longer it stays on the palate—partly because it was barrel-fermented in French oak, and partly because the addition of 6% Semillon bolsters the texture considerably. The finish is long and rich, with suggestions of peach and apricot on the extreme length.
The 2014 version of Mondavi's To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Reserve ($142) was blended with 6% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petite Verdot. On the nose, fragrant aromas of black raspberry and anise mingle with whiffs of toasty oak. The stated philosophy is “powerful but gentle,” and the wine enters the mouth seamlessly, giving way in the mid palate to an assertive texture that combines flavors of black cherry, minerals and earthiness with bright acidity. That acidity carries the elements onto a long, mouthwatering finish.
SARASOTA, Fla. (WFLA) – A jury ruled on Friday that former Sarasota County Deputy Frank Bybee is not guilty of attempted first degree murder of a 79-year-old woman.
The jury did rule that Bybee is guilty of kidnapping and other charges.
The jury deliberated for seven hours on Friday.
Bybee faced 18 felony charges that included attempted murder, kidnapping and exploitation of the elderly.
Prosecutor Karen Fraivillig said Bybee befriended 79-year-old Marcia Sohl in October 2016 when he had to Baker Act her.
Over the next few months, prosecutors say Bybee took advantage of Sohl, accessing her bank accounts and retrieving money from her account numerous times to buy items like gas.
Bybee's sentencing date has not been scheduled.

MiniArt 1/35 T-54-2 m1949 Soviet Medium Tank Kit First Look
By Michael Benolkin
Date of Review April 2017 Manufacturer MiniArt Subject T-54-2 m1949 Soviet Medium Tank Scale 1/35 Kit Number 37012 Primary Media Styrene Pros Beautiful detailing, full interior Cons Nothing noted Skill Level Experienced MSRP (USD) $45.95 (approximate)
First Look
When Soviet planners began production of the T-54 in the 1940s, it was the next step in tank development where the short-lived T-44 had been overcome by parallel improvements with the T-34/85. Designed around a 100mm main gun, the initial production T-54-1 configuration offered a newer chassis design paired with a turret left-over from the T-34/85 and T-44 series. When production problems were encountered with the T-54-1, the design was revised with some improvements in the hull and a new turret that resembled the dome-style used by the Josef Stalin tanks. This configuration entered production in 1949 as the T-54-2 and continued through 1951 when a revised turret without the rear 'shot traps' was introduced along with an improved telescopic gunner's sight and became the T-54-3.
Here is MiniArt's latest release, the T-54-2 m1949 which illustrates nicely how the early T-54 series transformed the Soviet battle tanks from the higher profile combat vehicles to the low-profile combatants that would be seen on battlefields around the world. The kit is molded in gray styrene and presented on 48 parts trees plus one tree of clear parts (duplicate trees not shown) and one fret of photo-etched parts. According to the manufacturer, there are 714 parts to build up this kit. This release is the standard kit with some details in the turret but no interior details otherwise to make this a faster build. If you're looking for this variant with an interior, you want kit 37004 instead. Nevertheless, there is some serious mass to the box when you pick it up.
Among the features and options in this kit:
Positionable engine access hatches
Photo-etched engine deck grilles
Torsion bar suspension detail on the hull interior
Detailed stowage and pioneering tools on hull exterior
Individual track links with stunning details
Detailed D-10T main gun and coaxial machine gun in turret
One-piece D-10T gun barrel with slide molded hollow tube
Detailed DShK machine gun on commander's hatch ring mount
Positionable crew hatches
Clear periscopes provided
The decals/color profiles are included for six examples as they appeared in the 50th anniversary of the Soviet Army. One note here, where some of the recent releases featured painting instructions using Mig paints (which is fine if you have access to Mig paints), MiniArt has resumed using paint instructions calling out Mig, Humbrol, Mr. Color, Testors, and Vallejo paints. Thank you MiniArt!
This is a nice looking kit and is not over-engineered. Assembly is straightforward but still recommended for experienced modelers. If you're wondering what is coming next, MiniArt has already announced the T-54B (early) and Tiran 4 (late) tanks which will also be released with or without interiors. It is very nice to see these kits coming as the T-54 has been a long-overlooked subject and while Takom has released the T-54, there is no comparison with one of these kits with the interior provided. It makes me hopeful that MiniArt will continue through the later tanks with this same level of interior and exterior details!
My sincere thanks to MiniArt for this review sample!
On Monday, April 17, the 36-year-old City of Ramsey Republican announced his bid to become attorney general.
"I'm running because I want to take my real world legal experience representing clients against some of the biggest and best law firms all over the country and put that to work for the people of Minnesota," he said.
Democrats have held the attorney general's office since 1971. Current Attorney General Lori Swanson has been in office since 2007, since her former boss in the office, Mike Hatch, left it to run for governor. Swanson herself is considered a possible candidate for governor in 2018.
Niska criticized Swanson for not defending the state law that allowed private audits, which DFL state Auditor Rebecca Otto has challenged in court. Otto herself is now running for governor.
He also said state attorneys general should be active in pushing back against federal government overreach. For instance, many Republican attorneys general sued the federal government over the individual mandate in President Obama's Affordable Care Act. Niska said during that time, "Minnesota was totally inactive on any of these cases."
He was critical, however, of Swanson's decision to have Minnesota join the early suit against President Donald Trump's travel ban. Niska said the state's challenge to the ban was a "knee-jerk reaction" to a fluid situation.
"The job of the attorney general is to uphold and enforce the law on behalf of all Minnesotans and in every courtroom. It is not about defending one political party or another and the job is not to make the law," he said.
Niska and his wife Jen Niska have been heavily involved in Republican campaigns and politics. He has also served as the Republican Party's 2012 platform committee chair and on the City of Ramsey's Charter Commission. He graduated from Anoka High School, Concordia College in Moorhead and the University of Minnesota Law School.
He is the second Republican to announce a run for attorney general. Former Eagan state Rep. Doug Wardlow did so earlier this year. Democrats Ryan Winkler, a former state House member from Golden Valley, and Rep. John Lesch, of St. Paul, are also running.
Trump congratulates Erdoğan on disputed Turkey poll
Donald Trump called Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to congratulate him on winning a referendum granting him sweeping new powers that exposed bitter divisions in the country.
The White House said they also discussed a US missile strike in Syria and the fight against the Islamic State group.
Trump's congratulations on Monday were in contrast with EU leaders who have been reserved in their reaction to the narrow victory and even his own State Department, which earlier noted concerns expressed by international observers over the “uneven playing field”.
Returning in triumph to his presidential palace in Ankara, Erdoğan angrily rejected the criticism, telling the monitors: “Know your place.”
The referendum was seen as crucial not just for shaping Turkey's political system but also the future strategic direction of a nation that has been a NATO member since 1952 and a European Union hopeful for half a century.
Showing no sign of pulling his punches, Erdoğan said Turkey could hold further referendums on its EU bid and re-introducing the death penalty.
The “Yes” camp won 51.41 percent in Sunday's referendum, according to complete results released by election authorities.
But the opposition immediately cried foul, claiming a clean vote would have made a difference of several percentage points and handed them victory.
The main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) and the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) said they would challenge the results from most ballot boxes due to alleged violations.
“There is only one decision to ease the situation in the context of the law — the Supreme Election Board (YSK) should annul the vote,” the Dogan news agency quoted CHP deputy leader Bulent Tezcan as saying.
The referendum has no “democratic legitimacy”, HDP spokesman and lawmaker Osman Baydemir told reporters in Ankara.
There were protests in Istanbul with a few thousand people crowding the anti-Erdogan Besiktas and Kadikoy districts, blowing whistles and chanting “We are shouldered to shoulder against fascism”.
– ‘Unlevel playing field' –
The opposition had already complained of an unfair campaign that saw the “Yes” backers swamp the airwaves and use billboards across the country in a saturation advertising campaign.
International observers agreed the campaign was conducted on an “unlevel playing field” and that the vote count itself was marred by procedural changes that removed key safeguards.
“The legal framework… remained inadequate for the holding of a genuinely democratic referendum,” the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) monitors said in a statement.
The Turkish opposition was particularly incensed by a decision by the YSK to allow voting papers without official stamps to be counted, which they said opened the way for fraud.
“Late changes in counting procedures removed an important safeguard,” said Cezar Florin Preda, head of the PACE delegation.
But Erdoğan said Turkey had no intention of paying any attention to the monitors' report.
He added: “This country held the most democratic polls that have never been seen in any other country in the West.”
– ‘End of the dream' –
Erdoğan earlier congratulated cheering supporters at Ankara's airport for “standing tall” in the face of the “crusader mentality” of the West.
Getting back to business as usual, his cabinet swiftly extended by another three months the already nine month state of emergency imposed after last July's failed coup.
There were also signs of a looming crisis with the EU.
Erdoğan reaffirmed he would now hold talks on reinstating capital punishment — a move that would automatically end Turkey's EU bid — and would hold a referendum if it did not get enough votes in parliament to become law.
German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said that if Ankara were to bring back the death penalty, the move would be “synonymous with the end of the European dream”.
In an interview in the Bild newspaper to be published Tuesday, he warned Turkey that “joining would not work right now”.
Erdoğan said Turkey could hold a referendum on the membership bid. “What George, Hans or Helga say does not interest us,” he said, using typical European names.
– ‘Big cities say No' –
Turkey's new political system is due to come into effect after elections in November 2019, although Erdoğan is expected to rapidly rejoin the ruling Justice Development Party (AKP) he founded but had to leave when he became president.
It would dispense with the prime minister's post and centralise the entire executive bureaucracy under the president, giving Erdoğan the direct power to appoint ministers.
Erdoğan's victory was far tighter than expected, emerging only after several nail-biting hours late Sunday which saw the “No” result dramatically catch up.
Turkey's three largest cities — Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir — all voted “No” although “Yes” prevailed in Erdoğan's Anatolian heartland.

Lana Del Rey spent the weekend at Coachella, chilling with Katy Perry and filming Father John Misty and dancing to Kendrick Lamar. On her way home, she apparently wrote a new song, and now she's shared a video of herself singing it in the middle of the woods. “I'm not gonna lie — I had complex feelings about spending the weekend dancing whilst watching tensions w North Korea mount,” she wrote on Instagram. “I find it's a tightrope between being vigilantly observant of everything going on in the world and also having enough space and time to appreciate God's good earth the way it was intended to be appreciated. On my way home I found myself compelled to visit an old favorite place of mine at the rim of the world highway where I took a moment to sit down by the sequoia grove and write a little song. I just wanted to share this in hopes that one individual's hope and prayer for peace might contribute to the possibility of it in the long run.” Watch below.

The car was in autonomous mode with an operator behind the wheel
An Uber self-driving car has hit and killed a woman crossing the street in Arizona, marking the first fatality caused by an autonomous vehicle and a potential blow to the technology expected to transform transportation.
The ride services company said it was suspending North American tests of its self-driving vehicles, which are currently going on in Arizona, Pittsburgh and Toronto.
So-called robot cars, when fully developed by companies including Uber, Alphabet Inc and General Motors Co, are expected to drastically cut down on motor vehicle fatalities and create billion-dollar businesses. But Monday's accident underscored the possible challenges ahead for the promising technology as the cars confront real-world situations involving real people.
U.S. lawmakers have been debating legislation that would speed introduction of self-driving cars.
"This tragic accident underscores why we need to be exceptionally cautious when testing and deploying autonomous vehicle technologies on public roads," said Democratic Senator Edward Markey, a member of the transportation committee, in a statement.
Elaine Herzberg, 49, was walking outside the crosswalk on a four-lane road in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe about 10 p.m. MST Sunday (0400 GMT Monday) when she was struck by the Uber vehicle, police said. The car was in autonomous mode with an operator behind the wheel.
Herzberg later died from her injuries in a hospital, police said.
Local television footage of the scene showed a crumpled bike and a Volvo XC90 SUV with a smashed-in front. It was unknown whether Herzberg was on foot or on a bike.
Volvo, the Swedish car brand owned by China's Geely, confirmed its vehicle was involved in the crash but said the software controlling the SUV was not its own.
U.S. federal safety regulators were sending teams to investigate the crash. Canada's transportation ministry in Ontario, where Uber conducts testing, also said it was reviewing the accident.
Wild west
Uber and Waymo on Friday urged Congress to pass sweeping legislation to speed the introduction of self-driving cars into the United States. Some congressional Democrats have blocked the legislation over safety concerns, and Monday's fatality could hamper passage of the bill, congressional aides said Monday.
Safety advocates called for a national moratorium on all robot car testing on public roads.
"Arizona has been the wild west of robot car testing with virtually no regulations in place," said Consumer Watchdog, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, in a statement. "That's why Uber and Waymo test there. When there's no sheriff in town, people get killed."
Arizona has opened its arms to companies testing self-driving vehicles as a means to economic growth and jobs. Republican Governor Doug Ducey reached out to Uber in 2016 after California regulators cracked down on the company over its failure to obtain testing permits.
Self-driving cars being tested routinely get into fender-benders with other vehicles. Last week, a self-driving Uber crashed with another vehicle in Pittsburgh, local news reported. There were no injuries.
A year ago, Uber temporarily grounded its self-driving cars for a few days following a crash with another car in Tempe. The company has been the subject of a number of complaints about its autonomous vehicles, but the company has said the cars were being driven by a human driver at the time of the incidents.
Essential to Uber's success
Uber has said its ability to build autonomous cars is essential to its success in the rapidly changing transportation industry. The company envisions a network of autonomous cars that would be summoned through the Uber app that would supplement - and eventually replace - human-driven cars.
Uber has logged 2 million self-driving miles (3.2 million km) through December. The company has more than 100 autonomous cars testing on the roads of the greater Phoenix area, the company's prime testing ground due to the state's loose regulations and hospitable weather. Rain, snow and ice are particularly challenging for autonomous cars. The company also tests in Pittsburgh and Toronto.
Concerns over the safety of autonomous vehicles flared after a July 2016 fatality involving a Tesla Inc automobile with a partially autonomous system that required human supervision. Safety regulators later determined Tesla was not at fault.
Uber has weathered a series of crises, including sexual harassment claims, using a tracking tool to avoid government officials, and a lawsuit brought by competitor Waymo alleging theft of self-driving trade secrets. Uber settled that lawsuit last month for US$245 million.
That settlement was largely seen as a means for Uber to resume work on autonomous cars without the distraction of litigation, as it hustles to catch up with Waymo, widely seen as having the most advanced cars in the industry.

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) – Many are asking whether a center guardrail would've made a difference in a fiery crash Thursday on the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway.
Luiz Felipak, 41, was driving his wife Rita Felipak, 29, and their 8-year-old daughter Giorgia in the area of the Bay to Bay Boulevard and Euclid Avenue exits when they were killed in the crash.
Tampa police tell us the family's car crossed into oncoming traffic, struck two cars and caught fire after Amber Perera, 29, slammed into the back of them, setting off the chain reaction crash.
Perera is accused of driving under the influence and leaving the scene.

There are several sections in that area without guardrails in the median.
“It certainly would have saved the lives of these three people, perhaps,” said Don Rogers, a witness who helped pull Luiz Felipak from the burning car.
Rogers wished he had more time to help and wished there were guardrails in the center median.
“They would've hit the center guardrail pretty hard, but it would've saved them from going completely across the way,” Rogers said.
Susan Chrzan, spokesperson for Tampa Hillsborough Expressway Authority says there have been a lot of crossover accidents in that area.
“Sometimes they do put in guardrails, but it's usually because of an accident rate, and right now, we've only had one other accident in the past 10 years that's been a crossover accident,” said Chrzan.
The first accident wasn't fatal and involved one car, according to Chrzan.

She said guardrails aren't required on the highway under national design standards. Chrzan said the expressway authority have installed about a mile of guardrail over the past few years.
Crash rates are reviewed every two years, according to Chrzan.
“Sometimes it [a guardrail] makes the accident worse, because you do like a ping pong effect, so that's another thing that they have to look at, is to make sure that the cars don't necessarily do that,” Chrzan said.
Chrzan says there's another factor that could make situations more unpredictable.
“Unfortunately, there are still human factors and this was definitely a human factor, speeding under the influence, allegedly,” she said. “You can plan as much as you can and you can do safety as much as you can, but when you have a human factor involved, it's very difficult to overcome that.”
The expressway authority will review crash rates later this year and will decide whether to install more guardrails along the expressway, Chrzan says.

SAN ANTONIO (AP) — LaMarcus Aldridge had 33 points and 12 rebounds, and the San Antonio Spurs blew a 16-point lead to the injury-ravaged Golden State Warriors before pulling away for an 89-75 victory on Monday night.
The Spurs beat Golden State for the first time in four tries this season and won their fourth straight overall to move into fifth place in the Western Conference, one-half game ahead of idle Utah and New Orleans.
Already without injured All-Stars Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson, the Warriors lost Draymond Green in the second quarter to a bruise in the pelvic area. Green took a knee to the groin while defending a drive to the basket by Danny Green.
The Warriors weren't getting any sympathy from a Spurs team that has played without Kawhi Leonard for much of the season.
Golden State still managed to hold the Spurs to 12 points in the third quarter, matching their season low for points in any period.
Two blocked shots propelled the Warriors to their first lead of the game.
JaVale McGee blocked Dejounte Murray's attempted floater and then scored on a dunk to pull Golden State within 59-57 with 2:21 remaining in the third. Quinn Cook tied the game on a jumper after Patrick McCaw came from the weak side defensively to stuff Pau Gasol near the rim. Kevon Looney gave the Warriors the lead at 63-61 on jumper with 2 seconds left in the frame.
Aldridge scored five straight points early in the fourth quarter to help the Spurs recapture a 66-65 advantage. He finished with 17 points in the fourth, including 11 straight that erased a four-point deficit and gave San Antonio a 72-65 lead it would not relinquish.
Cook led Golden State with 20 points, Looney added 12 and Andre Iguodala and Nick Young had 10 each.
Mills finished with 12 points and Danny Green added 11.
TIP-INS
Warriors: Curry (right ankle), Durant (fractured rib) and Thompson (fractured right thumb) did not travel with the team, remaining in Oakland to continue rehabilitating their injuries. ... Curry was scheduled to be reevaluated Tuesday. ... The Warriors' highest point total in a quarter was 22 in the third. Golden State scored 42 points in the third quarter against Phoenix on Saturday, the 11th time it has scored 40-plus in a quarter this season. ... Golden State has won six games when trailing by 15-plus points.
Spurs: Leonard was not on the bench, as he has been for much of the team's current six-game homestand. Leonard (right quadriceps tendinopathy) has played in only nine games this season. ... Murray had eight rebounds to set the franchise record for rebounds in a single season by a point guard. Murray has 385 rebounds in 1,436 minutes, surpassing Johnny Moore's total of 378 collected in 2,689 minutes.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the incident of a driver ramming a car into a crowd of demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday, which killed a young woman and sent 19 other people to hospitals, "does meet the definition of domestic terrorism" in U.S. law.
"It does meet the definition of domestic terrorism in our statute," Sessions said on ABC News' "Good Morning America" today. "We are pursuing it in the [Department of Justice] in every way that we can make a case."
"You can be sure we will charge and advance the investigation towards the most serious charges that can be brought because this is unequivocally an unacceptable evil attack," he said. "Terrorism investigators from the FBI are working on the case as well as civil rights division FBI agents."
The car-ramming incident occurred shortly after authorities in Charlottesville called off a planned white nationalist rally, titled "Unite the Right," and ordered crowds to disperse following violent clashes between rallygoers and counterprotesters.
Heather Heyer, 32, who was with a group protesting against the white nationalist gathering, was killed when the car plowed into the crowd.
The suspected driver, 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. of Ohio, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder in the incident.
President Trump drew criticism when after the incident he said he condemned "hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides," which some commentators said appeared to draw a moral equivalence between the white nationalists rallying in Charlottesville and the counterprotesters.
But Sessions said on "GMA" that the president "explicitly condemned the kind of ideology behind these movements of Nazism, white supremacy, the KKK. That is his unequivocal position, he totally opposes this kind of values."
The attorney general added, "The president, I suspect, will be talking to the country again soon, maybe today. I plan to meet with him today and the FBI today will be meeting with him to brief him on this case. He takes this exceedingly seriously."

TORONTO — Ontario's new Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford is addressing supporters at a rally in Toronto tonight.
Christine Elliott, who placed second to Ford in the leadership race and initially contested his victory, is expected to introduce him at the event.
Members of the Tory caucus are also expected to attend the so-called “unity rally.”
The Progressive Conservative leadership contest was triggered by the resignation of former leader Patrick Brown amid sexual harassment allegations.
The Tories have been leading in the polls despite the turmoil they've been in since Brown stepped down in January.
Ontario's provincial election is expected to be held on June 7.
The Ottawa Senators needed a late rally in Game 2 to tie up their Eastern Conference quarterfinal matchup with the Boston Bruins.
In Game 3 they had to stave off a furious charge by the Bruins to regain the series lead.
Bobby Ryan scored on a tip-in on a power play 5:43 into overtime, and the Ottawa recovered after giving up a three-goal lead to beat Boston 4-3 Monday night and take a 2-1 edge in the first-round series.
Just over a minute after Bruins center Riley Nash received a 2-minute penalty for roughing Ryan, Ryan got free in the zone, tapping it in on assists by Kyle Turris and Erik Karlsson. Mike Hoffman added two goals for Ottawa, with Derick Brassard scoring the other. Craig Anderson finished with 17 saves.
"I always say that you make your money during the season, but you make your reputation in the playoffs, and right now he's showing everybody that he's a gamer," Senators coach Guy Boucher said of Ryan.
It was the second straight overtime game of the series, and second consecutive win for the Senators following their 4-3 victory in Game 2.
Game 4 is Wednesday night in Boston.
This time Bruins rallied from a 3-0 deficit with three goals in second period, tying the game on a power play goal by David Pastrnak.
Noel Acciari and David Backes also scored for the Bruins. Tuukka Rask stopped 28 shots.
"We were allowed to play in the second and third (periods), we were a better team," Pastrnak said. "We had many opportunities to end it in the third."
Bruin fans rained sustained boos on the referees after Ryan's goal and threw items on the TD Garden ice in protest of the Nash's penalty, which give the Senators the one-man advantage.
Boston interim coach Bruce Cassidy said the penalty took the energy out of his team's surge to tie the game in regulation.
"Yeah, I agree with you 100 percent — demoralizing," he said.
Ottawa seemed to be cruising in the second period following Hoffman's second goal of the night off a power play to make it 3-0. But then Boston finally got going on the offensive end.
First, Acciari, who returned from injury, got Boston on the board on a tip-in off a miss by John- Michael Liles. That was followed 42 seconds later by Backes' slap shot after he broke through the Senators defense to swipe the puck and open the ice.
Then, the Bruins finally cashed in on Pastrnak's goal with Dion Phaeneuf in the penalty box for slashing.
It nearly nullified what was a dominating start by the Senators, who kept the action on their side of the red line for most of the first period.
The Bruins played through a rash of injuries in the first two games, and were missing defensemen Adam McQuaid, Torey Krug, Brandon Carlo and Colin Miller on Monday.
Acciari and center David Krejci both returned, but Boston struggled early to find much offensive traction.
Hoffman and Brassard scored just 25 seconds apart in the first period and exploited a depleted Boston defense to give Ottawa an early 2-0 lead.
The Bruins made up for their sloppy start and came out more aggressive on the offensive end in the second period, scoring three goals on just seven shots — including the two in 42 seconds — to get back into the game.
The Senators outshot the Bruins 10-3 in the first, taking advantage of several defensive breakdowns on their side of the ice.
Ottawa's first goal of the night came after Erik Karlsson flipped a pass behind Boston's defense to spring Hoffman on a breakaway. Hoffman controlled the puck and easily tapped it by Rask into the right corner of the net.
Then Brassard got on the board, slipping a slap shot by Rask for his second goal in two games.
Backes had the best opportunity to score for the Bruins in first period, but his attempt to fire a glove side shot by Anderson was wide right, striking the post.
It was the first game of the series that the Bruins had trailed after the opening 20 minutes.
"Momentums are crazy," Anderson said. "Win your little battles and it goes a long way in the war."
NOTES: Ottawa was 2 for 4 on power plays. ... Acciari and Tommy Cross both played in their first NHL playoff games, bringing the total to 11 Bruins that have made their postseason debuts in the series.

That article outlined the basic differences between the CCC which favors the concept of “managed retreat,” essentially a doctrine, which promotes the idea of doing little or nothing concerning the rising tides that are threatening homes and structures near the shore, and the Constitutional right that a homeowner has to protect one's property from destruction and illegal seizure by the government. If you think that I overstated that position, I refer you to AB 1129. This bill will go to the Assembly Conference in the next two weeks. It's hard to believe that in America the government is attempting to promote this bill to take away a basic right to protect one's property and unilaterally to impose illegal, burdensome and confiscatory fines if one defends that right to do so.
Beautiful Dana Point, where we all live, has a tremendous amount of coastal property. Not only do the property taxes of these coastal residents as well as your property taxes help to finance the multiple and expensive city development measures, but summer beach rentals supply needed tax revenue and much influx of tourism which is necessary for this city's fiscal survival. Over the years, we have all noted a diminution of our private rights that are constitutionally guaranteed. Often, some people are demonized as though they are the enemy of the public good. This is extremely evident in AB 1129. Coastal owners pay for their storm protection so that everybody can continue to enjoy our beautiful coast. We all will lose if this bill is enacted, especially Dana Point.
Rhetoric that seeks to destroy a private individual's inalienable right to protect his property is unjust and wrong.

The Netherlands' main intelligence service says it is treating a small group of Dutch children in conflict zones in Iraq and Syria as "Jihadist travelers" since they may have received military training.
In a report published Wednesday, the General Intelligence and Security Service says at least 80 Dutch children are in those areas, either having been born there or taken there by one or both parents. It says fewer than 20 percent of the children are age 9 or older.
The report says that because children in territory controlled by the so-called Islamic State group "sometimes receive weapons and combat training from as young as nine years old," intelligence officials consider them jihadi travelers.
Dutch authorities routinely detain people caught returning from Syria if they are suspected of extremist links.

Acting National Chairman of the NPP, Freddie Blay
The acting National Chairman of the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP), Freddie Blay has appealed to Ghanaians to be patient with government as it works out concerns of institutions and Ghanaians at large.
Mr. Blay, who is also the board chair of the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation GNPC, believes Ghana's problems cannot be solved by the government immediately, in the light of the economic situation the NPP inherited from the previous government.
Speaking exclusively to Citi News in Takoradi, Mr. Blay insisted that nothing can be done immediately to address problems that have existed for many years.
He said “nothing will be done immediately to the extent that all solutions will be found to all problems that have persisted over years particularly considering the kind of economy this government inherited. Government is saddled with huge debts, the microeconomic situation is that bad which needs to be stabilized. You can't do all of them at the same time.”
He added that “we are improving NHIS, we are bringing free education starting September, and quite a lot of other programs. Even cocoa as we have depended on have had its prices coming down very badly. If you consider all these things, we can't solve all the problems overnight.”
He acknowledged the trust Ghanaians have had in the NPP to turn things around but said, whilst government is working to deal with the problems under the leadership of Nana Akuffo Addo, “we expect people to be patient. We plead with them to be a little bit patient with the government.”
“It's understandable when you have been hungry for a while, when you have been cheated for a while, and you think your government has come into power, you will wish that all problems should be solved immediately.”

United Airlines signed a deal to add 20 used Airbus A319s and moved another 23 aircraft it operates from leases to its own balance sheet, continuing its trend of re-shaping the capital costs of its operating fleet. Citing the seller's preference, the carrier declined to identify where the A319s are coming from, saying only that they will be delivered in 2020 and 2021. “Used aircraft provide us an enhanced opportunity to maximize returns regardless of where we are ...

Comedian, political satirist and campaigner Mark Thomas's latest live production is aptly named A Show That Gambles.
On arrival we were asked to write two predictions for the short and the longer future and these offerings were the material which Mark used to engage and entertain the audience. At the end of the evening we were asked to donate £1 to be used to fund the bets we agreed on placing. The results were hilarious.
At a breakneck pace, Thomas pointed out that we make predictions all the time, referencing his terrifying upbringing with his often violent builder/totter/preacher father in south London. At his best when ad hoc quipping in response to the audience's suggestions, Thomas is given to rants, but even better, to listening.
Amid impeached Trumps, rejected Mays, elected Corbyns, there were more quirky contributions, including Buxton Weather Watch becoming the preferred national weather service, a sinkhole opening under the offices of the Daily Mail, (second most popular) and the winner, that in the near future more dogs would be called Keith. And if our bet won? Then the money would go to a good because that would also ****** *** (really annoy) the right people.
Splendid and well informed entertainment with an audience of like minded people.

Wilson football team didn't win a game last season.
But the Warriors aren't worried about that heading into this fall.
"Coming off an 0-10 season isn't tough at all. It's a new year and a fresh start," Wilson senior running back/defensive back Job Goodman said. "What happened last year is in the past and we're ready to improve from it. We can't worry about the things we can't change, we can only focus on what we can do this season."
Goodman returns for the Warriors after racking up 1,161 yards and 10 touchdowns on the ground last year.
"This offseason we have made a lot of improvements and I can't wait to see how it turns out once the games start up," Goodman said.
PHILADELPHIA -- The Eagles delivered some positive injury news on Monday -- but it wasn't the news fans were waiting for.
Shortly after announcing that quarterback Carson Wentz was out for the season with a torn ACL, head coach Doug Pederson announced that rookie cornerback Sidney Jones would practice this week for the first time since being selected by the Eagles in the 2017 NFL Draft.
Jones was drafted by the Eagles in the second round, but was considered a top-10 talent. He slipped to the second round because of a torn Achilles he suffered this past March.
Pederson would not commit to Jones playing this season.
Will the Eagles sign a new quarterback?
Now that he is practicing, Jones has 21 days to work with the team. After that three-week period, the Eagles have to decide if they want to add Jones to the 53-man roster, or place him on the season-ending injured reserve list.
The Eagles have three games remaining this season, but now that they have clinched the NFC East, they also have a playoff game as well -- meaning Jones has extra time to prepare for potentially playing in a game.
If Jones does return this season, it is likely it would be as a role player, and not in the starting role he will likely be handed next season.
The return of Jones is a positive development, but it doesn't carry the same weight it might have at the beginning of the season. The Eagles' cornerbacks have been playing at a much higher level than expected, with Jalen Mills, Ronald Darby, Patrick Robinson and Rasul Douglas all turning in strong seasons so far.

A West Virginia man is facing a murder charge after authorities say he told his pastor he caused his mother's fatal overdose because he wanted to "end her pain."
News outlets report that 44-year-old Bradford Spencer of Bluefield was arrested Saturday following the Jan. 31 death of 65-year-old Virginia Spencer.
Authorities say the man forced his mother to take numerous pain pills. He is charged with first-degree murder.
Bluefield police records say Spencer spoke to his pastor at a funeral home on Feb. 9, telling him that he regretted killing his mother, but he was tired of seeing her in pain. It's unclear what condition the woman was suffering from.
Spencer was arraigned Monday and is being held on a $100,000 bond. Records do not show whether he has an attorney.
MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Gunmen posing as military forces were holding an unknown number of hostages inside a popular restaurant in Somalia's capital in an attack that began when a car bomb exploded at the gate, police and a witness said, while the extremist group al-Shabab claimed responsibility. At least 17 people, including foreigners, were dead, police and an ambulance driver said.
Two of the gunmen were shot dead and 10 hostages were rescued but five other attackers were thought to remain inside, cutting off electricity to complicate security forces' efforts to end the siege, Capt. Mohamed Hussein said. He said heavy gunfire was heard.
An ambulance driver with the Amin Ambulance service, Khalif Dahir, said early Thursday they had carried 17 bodies and 26 wounded people. Police said the dead included a Syrian man. Most of the victims were young men who had been entering the Pizza House when the vehicle exploded, Hussein said.
The gunmen “were dressed in military uniforms. They forced those fleeing the site to go inside” the restaurant, witness Nur Yasin told The Associated Press.
Wednesday night's blast largely destroyed the restaurant's facade and sparked a fire. While al-Shabab claimed to have attacked the neighboring Posh Treats restaurant, which is frequented by the city's elite and was damaged in the blast, security officials said the Pizza House was targeted instead.
Security forces rescued Asian, Ethiopian, Kenyan and other workers at Posh Treats as the attack continued, Hussein said.
The Somalia-based al-Shabab often targets high-profile areas of Mogadishu, including hotels, military checkpoints and areas near the presidential palace. It has vowed to step up attacks after the recently elected government launched a new military offensive against it.
Al-Shabab last year became the deadliest Islamic extremist group in Africa, with more than 4,200 people killed in 2016, according to the Washington-based Africa Center for Strategic Studies.
The extremist group also faces a new military push from the United States after President Donald Trump approved expanded operations, including airstrikes, against al-Shabab. On Sunday, the U.S. military in Africa said it carried out an airstrike in southern Somalia that killed eight Islamic extremists at a rebel command and logistics camp.
Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed confirmed that airstrike and said such attacks would disrupt the group's ability to conduct new attacks.
With a new federal government established, pressure is growing on Somalia's military to assume full responsibility for the country's security. The 22,000-strong African Union multinational force, AMISOM, which has been supporting the fragile central government, plans to start withdrawing in 2018 and leave by the end of 2020.
Also Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution extending the U.N. political mission in the Horn of Africa nation, which is trying to rebuild after more than two decades as a failed state, until March 31, 2018. The resolution recognized that “this is a critical moment for Somalia.”

In a tight, back-and-forth battle between the two top-ranked teams in the area, the Easton girls basketball team finally found some breathing room in the first few minutes of the fourth quarter of its Eastern Pennsylvania Conference showdown against Bethlehem Catholic.
The Red Rovers went on an 8-0 run to turn a two-point deficit into a six-point advantage.
Easton, which entered the game ranked No. 2 by lehighvalleylive, outscored top-ranked Becahi 19-9 in fourth quarter to secure a 53-42 road victory on Friday night.
“We're playing really well,” Easton coach Dave Lutz said. “Our girls play hard. They play unselfish. And when you do that, good things happen. Even against a really good team like Beca.”
LONDON (AP) — Roger Federer and Serena Williams are both back on Centre Court at Wimbledon on Wednesday as they look to advance to the third round.
Federer will play Lukas Lacko of Slovakia as he continues his quest for a record-extending ninth title at the England Club. Williams then faces Bulgarian qualifier Viktoriya Tomova as she goes for a 16th straight match win at the tournament — having missed last year while pregnant.

A lot has changed for the Chicago Cubs in the past year.
Right down to team mantras.
For the better part of 108 years, blowing a shot at a championship was met by shrugs and a feeling of, "That's just the Cubs."
The Cubs arrive this week at Sloan Park as World Series champions and manager Joe Maddon and Co. are grabbing onto a relatively fresh term: "That's Cub." Maddon, of course, loves to find creative ways to keep the players fresh and focused during a long season.
"That would be Cub, 'That's Cub' to move it forward, to win a World Series and then come back the next season and you're happy and you're impressed and you love what you've done, but you have to continue to move it forward," Maddon said.
Cubs president of baseball operations Theo Epstein said the phrase cropped up a few years ago when today's current standouts were youngsters in the organization. It has followed players like Kris Bryant, Kyle Schwarber, Albert Almora and Javier Baez to the major leagues.
"'That's Cub' started four or five years ago in the minors," Epstein said. "When they started realizing how good they were, and some of the things they were doing, we started saying, 'That's Cub.' It was great for morale and came to mean something positive organically. For years 'That's Cub' had a different connotation."
Some players were already sporting "That's Cub" shirts during workouts with Courage, Urgency and Belief spelled out under the corresponding letters.
Maddon also talked about three themes he will focus on this spring: Staying uncomfortable, authenticity and heart.
"It's really important to be uncomfortable," Maddon said. "If you become a comfortable person, I think that subtracts growth from the equation. I think if you remain somewhat uncomfortable, you'll continue to grow. You don't become stagnant. You don't become complacent, set in your ways. On every level, I want us to remain uncomfortable. I think that's a really positive word."
"For me, I really want us to really understand the authentic part of who we are," he said. "From that, be able to sustain what we've done in the past just by being us. Don't try to do anything different. There's a part of the sameness I would like to see, is the authentic part of our guys."
He mentioned Game 7 of the World Series at Cleveland. The Cubs blew a three-run lead in the eighth, with Rajai Davis hitting the tying homer off Aroldis Chapman. But they got a pep talk from Jason Heyward during a short rain delay after the ninth inning, scored two in the 10th and hung on after Cleveland got a run in the bottom half to bring home their first championship since 1908.
"Things went badly for a bit," Maddon said. "We came back and regrouped because our guys got together in a room, void of any kind of statistical, video, analytical information — they went in there as human beings and came out unified.
"Everybody just wants to talk about all this other stuff. Everybody's forgetting the heartbeat. I don't want us to forget the heartbeat, ever."
The topics eventually turned toward the players — Schwarber's desire to catch, managing pitchers' workload considering the season went to Nov. 2, bullpen depth, platoons in center field with Almora and John Jay and Baez's uncertain role. But the main theme of the initial news conference with general manager Jed Hoyer, Epstein and Maddon was how things must stay the same even though things are much different now that the organization isn't labeled with 100-plus years of jokes, curses and failures.
"The methods are still the same," Maddon said. "We weren't outcome oriented. We focus on the process to give you the best opportunity to succeed. Nothing changes in that regard. Embrace the target and everything else remains the same."
FOXBOROUGH, Mass. – 2015 was a special year for Krisztian Nemeth, one in which he posted 17 goals and seven assists across all competitions for Sporting Kansas City.
Now, after spending the 2016 season at Qatari club Al Gharafa, he's back in Major League Soccer and said after the New England Revolution's training session on Monday that his body of work is only just beginning.
“It was a good year playing from the left side, but definitely I have more for sure,” Nemeth told MLSsoccer.com. “That year was just the first year. It was different adjusting to the culture and league, but I have the experience of playing in many countries so I have acclimated fast and can make it. That's one good part. It's easy for me to join this team.”
In joining the Revs, Nemeth's biggest initial obstacle will be achieving game fitness. He last played a competitive match in March and said in “a few weeks” he should return to 100 percent, as he was recently in preseason with his Qatari club.
Once he reaches that point, the 28-year-old is excited – not discouraged – by the attacking glut New England boasts. He highlighted Kei Kamara, a forward who also previously played in Kansas City, as someone he's eager to link up with.
“I love to play with good players, it's the best thing to do,” Nemeth said. “I'm looking forward to it and hope as soon as possible I'm nearing fitness and can be on the field with them.”
To acquire Nemeth, New England executed a sign-and-trade agreement with Columbus Crew SC, a move that prompted debate as to where he would land. Reports from The Kansas City Star said there was interest from his former MLS club, an assertion Nemeth himself echoed on Monday at Gillette Stadium, noting, “I don't want to lie, yes, [Kansas City] was one option.”
But now that he's in New England, he said that wants to “show my best for the club” and reward them for their faith in sending $400,000 in allocation money Columbus' way to secure his services. He'll be one of the five players the Revs have used Targeted Allocation Money on, and added that all along it was a dream of his to return to MLS.
“I always knew when I left from Kansas that I wanted to come back to the league because I loved it, I loved every second of it,” Nemeth said. “My style of play fits well, so that was a big help.”
Before arriving in MLS, Nemeth got a crash course in the Qatari league, an environment which he said has a higher level than most realize, mostly as they invest financial resources ahead of hosting the 2022 World Cup.
The one part he joked that he won't miss, though, is Qatar's oppressive heat.
“The weather was crazy humid,” Nemeth said. “I came back from there one week ago, and it was [115, 120] degrees. That was the hardest part for sure.”
And now the question surrounding Nemeth is when he'll first play for the Revs, a side 3-1-0 in its last four games and looking to squeak into the playoffs. When asked about Nemeth's potential role, coach Jay Heaps said it's “too early to tell on complete match fitness” and that he should know more once they play 11-a-side in training.
But once that comes around, Heaps has no doubt that Nemeth will fit like a glove.
“The one thing that you don't just know with someone is how they're going to fit into a group,” Nemeth said. “For me, that I was what I was really excited to watch today, to see his interactions with players.
“When we talked about positioning and where we see him, his willingness to do whatever to help the team stood out,” Heaps added. “I love those conversations. Every player has a position they feel most comfortable in, but what you love about Krisztian is his willingness to do anything for the team.”

Black Stars
The Black Stars will take on their Ugandan counterparts knowing that there will be no room for an error in their quest for three points.
The Black Stars have played themselves into a complicated equation with two drawn games at home proving costly at this stage.
The West African country trail Egypt who are now book makers favorites to snatch the World Cup by 5 points with two games to go.
A lifeless performance against the Cranes of Uganda in Tamale kick-started a disappointing qualification series which eventually spilled over with another disappointing 0-0 drawn game against Congo at home.
Those two drawn games plus a spirited 2-0 defeat to Egypt meant the ball was out of their hands and they will have to be on top of their game to beat the brittle Cranes in their own backyard.
There is added pressure of missing key players due to injuries and disciplinary reason.But excuses will not be taken as the Stars know that anything but all three points will mean nothing to their teaming supporters back home.
True, we knew the game would be adapted to mobile in China back in November by Chinese internet giant Tencent, but didn't hear anything about a stateside release, though Canadians got it last week. Americans get the same officially-licensed ported version, which understandably pares down the graphics and only has the original map. The game requires Android 4.3 or above and works on "500-plus" phones, while the Apple device version requires iOS 9.0 or later and requires an iPhone 5S or sooner and most iPads.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon is doing a broad review of how military forces use exercise trackers and other wearable electronic devices, in the wake of revelations that an interactive, online map can pinpoint troop locations, bases and other sensitive areas around the world.
Army Col. Rob Manning, a Pentagon spokesman, said Monday that the review will determine if there should be additional training or restrictions on the use of the devices, such as Fitbits.
The Global Heat Map, published by the GPS tracking company Strava, uses satellite information to map the locations of subscribers to Strava's fitness service. The map shows activity from 2015 through September 2017.
Heavily populated areas are well lit, but warzones such as Iraq and Syria show scattered pockets of activity that could be caused by military or government personnel using fitness trackers as they move around. Those electronic signals could potentially identify military bases or other secure locations.
The Global Heat Map was posted online in November 2017, but the information it contains was only publicized recently. The issue was first reported by The Washington Post.
Manning said he was not aware of any compromise to U.S. security by the map and he did not believe there was any move yet to ban the devices. He also said he wasn't aware of any Pentagon effort to reach out to the company or request that the data be taken off line.
The Defense Department already has policies and guidelines for the use of social media accounts and other technology.
"The rapid development of technology requires constant refinement of policies and procedures to enhance force protection and operational security," said Manning. He said department personnel receive training and are advised to place strict privacy settings on their wireless devices and social media accounts. Also, those devices are not allowed in certain department locations, including classified areas.

Anyone who gets to see the total solar eclipse on August 21 will be lucky — and humanity is lucky to live on a planet that even has this kind of celestial event.
Mercury and Venus, after all, don't even have moons. Mars has a couple, but they're too small to completely blot out the sun. Gas giants like Jupiter do have big moons, but they don't have solid surfaces where you could stand and enjoy an eclipse.
And, even with solid land and a moon, Earth only gets its gorgeous total solar eclipses because of a cosmic coincidence.
"They appear to be the same size because of their distance away from us," explains Amber Porter, an astronomer at Clemson University, which is in the path of the upcoming eclipse. The diameter of Earth's moon is about 400 times smaller than the diameter of the sun, but "even though the moon is about 400 times smaller than the sun, it's about 400 times closer to us here on Earth, which is how that perfect kind of magic happens."
Because of this quirk, the tiny moon can obscure the entire face of the sun and reveal its eerie corona, at least right now. In the past, Earth's eclipses did not look like this.
"The size of the sun hasn't really changed over the age of Earth, but the moon has been moving away from Earth over eons. So in the past it looked bigger," says Matija Cuk, a planetary scientist at the SETI Institute.
The moon is still moving away from Earth, he says. Every year, it shifts outward about an inch-and-half.
"So actually for billions of years you can have a total eclipse, but this very evenly matched eclipse, where it is barely total, that happens for a relatively short amount of time," says Cuk.
In only about 600 million years, the moon will look small enough that it no longer completely covers the sun, and whoever is left on Earth won't see any more total solar eclipses. So, get them while you can.

The Urban Grooves movement that gripped the country at the turn of the millennium when the government announced 75% local content on radio represents a missed golden opportunity to significantly thrust contemporary Zimbabwean music onto at least the regional scene.
But the moment of a blow up became a damp squib. Fast forward perhaps a decade later, the streets gave birth to Zimdancehall a term coined by UK based artist and disc jockey Slaggy Yout.
Zimdancehall, a Jamaican Dancehall and Reggae inspired music style was in many ways an indirect offshoot of the broad Urban Grooves movement. In what is probably a déjà vu moment, sadly, we seem to be headed down the same road.
And it isn't a sexy pathway!
Could it be the law of diminishing returns taking a toll on the genre or a natural cycle associated with pop culture? It's perhaps easy and convenient to lay all the blame on the artists but a quick glance at those nations thriving musically in the region, for example, South Africa, shows you that music as an industry only grows where all stakeholders come to the party, from capable managers, promoters and the corporate world.
The artists themselves of course need to be driven and hungry enough no doubt. l caught up with a South Africa based music pundit Edward Kararira who believes Zimbabwean urban contemporary genres represent a gold mine of untapped export potential.
“There's need for the emergence of raw, ambitious arts or musical entrepreneurs. With the artists hungry enough to propel our unique urban contemporary music culture to at least the region and possibly globally. Young men with colossal dreams and ambitions! There are plenty urban contemporary artists who have got nothing more to prove locally,” he said.
Kararira thinks that with the structures in place, coupled with enough hunger on the part of the artist himself, there's no reason why Winky D, Tamy, SoulJah Luv, Sanni Makhalima, Alexio Kawara, Roki, Nutty O, ExQ shouldn't be rubbing shoulders with the best in the region!
Another comrade based in South Afric,a Norman Theodore, who is also an avid arts commentator attributes the bleak future Zimdancehall faces to an absence of an agreed broader strategy for self-renewal and succession. Yep!
That dirty word that gets even uniformed forces onto the streets has again popped up in music circles. Succession!
“The genre does not speak into the future with much of its content in form of current affairs music with a bold play-by date. There is lack of emphasis on new talent. Those big names are not doing much to bring in new names or repurpose fading ones. The producers who helped stitch together the genre used to do it for fame and passion and because there is not so much coming out of that, fatigue could be trickling in.”
And the trickle could seem more of a tsunami. An avalanche. The dearth is real. The Zimdancehall sound, quality, and style of composition have tentatively remained repetitive, stagnant and creating monotony. There seems to be no clear-cut strategy to sustain the momentum and take the music out of the country. Precariously there are no notable collaborations with musicians from other countries in Africa.
The hype which once seized the country and Zimbabweans living in the diaspora is evidently dying down and just like Urban Grooves, the latter has a countable number of pioneering survivors; voices like Soul Jah Love, Killer T and undoubtedly Winky D the last of which can easily be regarded as possibly the only artist who identifies with the genre but has managed to stay relevant and consistent.
There is a new generation popping up and last year had Silent Killer, Jah Signal and Boom Berto as some of the notables, but sadly the glory around them seems to be dying faster than one can say ‘musical coup!'
What could be the solution? Arts administrator and Reggae DJ with CapitalkFM Chamunorwa Mashoko thinks the solution lies in creating crossovers heavily founded with our traditional sound and instruments.
“Zimbabweans at home and abroad are the most culturally isolated people especially those in the diaspora. In most foreign cities you find West African clubs and festivals focused on West African products. Sadly Zimbabwean artists and establishments are busy copying other cultures.
“Imagine Nutty O dropping lines on traditional influenced beats? Look to the West as West Africans are already doing it and sadly now we stampede to copy them.”
The beginning of 2018 has seen the return of Riddims which propelled many artists to stardom at inception. In one day Chillspot Record released Decoy Riddim and the next day Solid Records dropped ZimDancehall Resurrection and I am reliably informed much more are coming but it's yet to be seen if the formula will work this time around.
The genre is in danger of extinction once radio stations that were instrumental in both incubation and curatorship rethink on content policy. To compound this, the genre grew out of piracy and there seems to be no clear strategy to grow away from the same in order to strengthen the genre.
There is an excessive penchant and an insatiable appetite for unnecessary publicity and excessive mania for non-monetizable fame. The genre must right-size, self-correct and untag itself from bad publicity and focus on creating long-lasting music.
Failure to learn from the demise of the urban grooves genre could be an addendum to a list of ballooning and worrying self-destructive tendencies chief among them being an entrenchment of drug abuse as the new normal. Should an Operation Restore Legacy be extended to the music and arts scene? Well, time will tell as the plot thickens. The Herald

Small Businesses Struggle with Rising Health Premiums
Small businesses are getting notices about their premium and coverage changes for 2018, and some are making adjustments because of that.
The changes vary depending on the state where a company is located, how many employees it has and how comprehensive its insurance is. But many owners are facing rate increases of double-digit percentages or dramatically reduced coverage -- or both.
Health insurance consultants expect more owners to rethink their strategies beyond 2018 and choose alternatives like paying for claims themselves or adding health services that can lower costs.
Workshop Digital's premiums are soaring 55 percent, and co-founder Brian Forrester says the business will be less profitable as it absorbs that. He may have to ask the Richmond, Virginia-based marketing agency's staffers to pay more for coverage in the future.
As small business owners learn what their 2018 health insurance costs will be, some are considering providing different types of coverage for their employees.
Companies are receiving notices of premium and coverage changes for 2018. The changes vary, depending on factors including the state where a company is located, how many employees it has and how comprehensive its insurance is. But many owners are seeing rate increases of double-digit percentages, finding dramatically reduced coverage, or both. Health insurance consultants expect more owners to rethink their strategies beyond 2018 and choose alternatives like paying for claims themselves or adding health services that can lower costs.
Gail Trauco's insurer is eliminating her company's policy known as a preferred provider organization, or PPO, replacing it with a health maintenance organization, or HMO, a change that would limit the choice of doctors for her five employees. Her annual costs were scheduled to rise nearly $10,000 in 2018.
The HMO was a deal-breaker, says Trauco, owner of The PharmaKon, which helps coordinate clinical drug trials.
"It's important for a patient to choose a physician they can have a good relationship with," says Trauco, whose business is based in Barnesville, Georgia. Trauco hired a health insurance broker who helped her find a PPO with a different carrier, and she's saving enough money to add dental coverage.
Some owners say they may not be able to keep shielding their staffers from rising health costs.
Workshop Digital's premiums are soaring 55 percent, and co-founder Brian Forrester says the business will be less profitable next year as it absorbs the increase. He may have to ask the Richmond, Virginia-based marketing agency's 30 staffers to pay more for coverage in the years ahead. The company currently pays 83 percent of medical insurance, 90 percent of vision care and 52 percent of dental coverage.
"We never plan on removing our coverage or reducing the type of coverage we offer, but the out-of-pocket costs for our team may have to go up over time," Forrester says.
Under the Affordable Care Act, companies with fewer than 50 employees aren't required to offer insurance, but many do because they feel it's right or because it helps them compete for and retain top workers. Fifty percent of companies with three to 49 workers have offered health benefits this year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health care trends. That compares with 53 percent of all employers, and is little changed from the previous three years.
James Bernstein, an executive at benefits consulting firm Mercer, says many offer employees a choice of plans to serve staffers' needs but also keep their own costs in line.
"What they're saying is, a one-plan-fits-all strategy does not work, especially with a multigenerational workforce: millennials, young families, baby boomers," Bernstein says.
A Mercer survey found many small businesses are considering coverage that has a higher deductible and in turn, lower premiums. These plans shift more costs to employees, but many owners contribute money to Health Savings Accounts, or HSAs, to help staffers pay medical expenses. The combination of a high-deductible plan and an HSA is known as a consumer-driven health plan, because it allows people to determine where they spend their health dollars.
Mercer found about a fifth of companies with 50 to 199 employees and 37 percent of companies with 200 to 499 workers plan to offer consumer-driven plans as a choice in the next three years. Those with 10 to 49 workers are less inclined to do so; only 10 percent said they will offer one.
Employers' health care costs have been rising for decades, not only since the ACA mandated minimum levels of insurance coverage in 2014. Health care costs at W.H. Christian soared between 150 percent and 180 percent over nine years, says Scott Christian, director of operations for the New York-based company that sells and rents work uniforms.
W.H. Christian ended the spiral last year, switching to what's called self-funded coverage for its 72 staffers. In self-funding, a company sets aside money to pay employees' claims rather than have an insurer do so. It buys stop-loss insurance or reinsurance to pay claims in case employees submit more claims than expected.
Money was just one factor in the change, Scott Christian says. The company saw the quality of its coverage declining, with doctor networks shrinking; it kept switching carriers in hopes of better coverage, but each renewal offer was a disappointment.
"The main driver was we wanted to give our employees a good plan," Christian says. "That seemed more and more impossible to provide given where the health insurance universe was going."
The number of small businesses that self-fund is small -- 15 percent of workers covered by insurance are in self-funded plans, versus 79 percent in large companies, according to the Kaiser foundation. Self-funding can be particularly beneficial for a company with a young and healthy staff, says Craig Scurato, a vice president with Leslie Saunders, an insurance and benefits broker based in Lutz, Florida.
Scurato also sees a growing interest in nontraditional medical services like direct primary care practices, doctor's offices that provide medical services including examinations and laboratory testing. The company pays a flat fee per month; insurance companies are not involved.
Midwest Scrap Management was interested in health services that would help it save money when it switched to self-funding in March -- one of the plan's appeals was that the metal processor would have more say over what its coverage would include, Chief Financial Officer Craig Ward says.
The Kansas City, Missouri-based company offers its 120 employees 24/7 access to telemedicine, allowing them to consult with clinicians and get advice and prescriptions when they don't feel well. It costs less than office visits. Midwest Scrap Management also offers biometric screening, which among other things measures cholesterol and blood sugar levels, letting staffers know if there's a problem.
The company has saved $20,000 off its projected health care costs since it switched, Ward says. And because an insurer is no longer in charge, there's no mystery about where the company's money is going.
"When you get a renewal every year from a traditional carrier, they tell you what your rate increase will be, but you never get a reason why," Ward says.

"His list of things-to-do that he put on his website is not going to help people to decide which way to vote and what's their best interest in this campaign," Horwath said. "What's worrisome is we have a leader who's trying to take the chair of the premier in this province and he's not being honest with people."
The Tories began the campaign with a significant lead only to find themselves now battling the NDP for first place in the polls, which also show the Liberals falling further behind both.
With the election roughly a week away, Wynne travelled to the heart of her NDP rival's riding on Wednesday to portray herself as the only seasoned stateswoman in the campaign capable of rising above the ideological fray.
At a stop in Hamilton outside a Stelco steel plant, she attacked both Horwath and Ford as unyielding ideologues without the experience to fend off the threat of American steel tariffs.
"On the one end of the spectrum, you have Doug Ford — he's expressed his admiration for (U.S. President) Donald Trump, despite the chaos, the uncertainty that the Trump administration has caused Ontario," Wynne said. "On the other extreme, you have the NDP, who have historically campaigned against free-trade agreements — I would suggest a rigid and impractical position."
The United States has exempted Canadian steel and aluminum from new tariffs on an interim basis. The exemption is due to expire Friday.
While the federal government under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has done much of the heavy lifting to protect the industry in Canada, Wynne played up her own efforts.
"Over the past year, I have met with 37 governors, I have met with senators, I've met with congresspeople, I've met with senior members of the U.S. administration, all in an attempt to make it clear what our integrated relationship means to workers on both sides of the border," said Wynne, who has been trailing behind her rivals in recent polls.
"We were assertive, we were steadfast in our effort to make Ontario's case to those decision makers. That threat of U.S. protectionism is not going to scare us off."
Wynne said Ontario has developed one of the strongest economies in North America under a Liberal government that worked with employees, business leaders, and political leaders on both sides of the Canada-U.S. border.
Voters have a choice between her and her two inexperienced rivals, she said.
"They're going to be choosing a person to lead them who will be in some very tricky, very delicate negotiations with U.S. officials," Wynne said. "That's the reality of the role premier (and) we cannot let ideology get in our way."
Horwath, who portrayed herself as a champion of steel and steelworkers, rejected Wynne's comments as "trying to stir up some trouble." She said she had been vocal in her support of the industry.
"Should I be given the opportunity to serve as premier I will be one of the biggest champions the steel industry has ever seen," Horwath said. "It has literally, not only built our country and fuelled the economy of a nation, but it has absolutely and completely ... built my city."

Trevor Powers, the musician formerly known as Youth Lagoon, has announced a new album under his given name. Mulberry Violence arrives August 17 from Powers's own new label, Baby Halo. Today's announcement follows the release of single “Playwright” earlier this month, and it comes with two new songs, “Ache” and “Plaster Saint.” The album's exact track list is still under wraps, but includes 10 songs total.
In a release, Powers explained he began working on Mulberry Violence while traveling after dissolving Youth Lagoon. The album was recorded at Sonic Ranch in Tornillo, Texas and mixed by Stuart White, who's previously engineered vocals for Beyoncé. Powers also cites three 20th-century visual artists with inspiring his “social and spiritual themes”: Francis Bacon, Sister Gertrude Morgan, and Harry Clarke, who when taken together suggest an interest in religious imagery, vibrant color, the grotesque, and the process of craftsmanship.
Listen to “Ache” and “Plaster Saint” below, especially if your idea of experimental pop sounds like Black Moth Super Rainbow or Oneohtrix Point Never's new material. See the cover artwork for Mulberry Violence and Trevor Powers's upcoming tour dates in the U.S. and Europe below.

ARLINGTON, Texas — Johnny Hamilton celebrated his birthday by scoring 20 points while grabbing 13 rebounds as UT Arlington held off Coastal Carolina 87-80 to even its Sun Belt Conference record on Saturday night.
Davion Turner had a career-high 20 points as the Mavericks halted Coastal Carolina's four-game win streak. Kevin Hervey added 15 points and Nathan Hawkins chipped in 11 with six assists and two steals for UTA (15-10, 6-6). Erick Neal, who finished with nine points, four assists and five steals became the first player in conference history to surpass 1,300 points, 700 assists, 400 rebounds and 200 steals.
Trailing 39-38 at the break, Neal drained a 3 to start the second half and Hamilton, who recorded his fifth double double, followed with a layup to take a 43-39 advantage and the Mavericks led the rest of the way.
Coastal Carolina stayed within striking distance, closing to 66-65 with 8:56 remaining. Hervey nailed a trey and the Mavericks pushed their lead to 75-67 after Hervey hit a jumper with 6:35 left.
Zac Cuthbertson led the Chanticleers (11-14, 5-7) with 15 points and 11 rebounds.
Tunsie Jabbour owns a smoking bar, the Lafayette Bar, home to Saturday night jazz shows that draw audiences from far and wide to Easton.
He'll prohibit smoking in the back room, where the musicians set up, if it bothers them. And he has about $5,000 invested in air purifiers known as smoke eaters to clear the air around the bar area itself.
"It's all about the customers and a lot of my customers smoke," Jabbour says of his decision to continue to allow smoking indoors. "A lot of the people that come to the jazz shows smoke. ...
"If they're happy with it, I'm going to stay with it. If they say, 'Hey, a certain number of us don't smoke and we like your bar and we like the music and we like the jazz, we like the way you do things, can we not have smoking?' I'll consider it."

PORTLAND, Ore. — A bicyclist is suing the city of Portland for $566,000 after he hit a pair of concrete islands on his way home from the World Naked Bike Ride, causing him to crash and break his nose, arm and two fingers.
The Oregonian/OregonLive reported Friday that, according to the lawsuit, a fully-clothed Charles Ziemer was pedaling back to his car after participating in the June 2016 ride when his wheels suddenly struck the islands.
The lawsuit filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court faults the city for failing to put reflectors or lights on the islands and situating them in a travel lane.
An employee at the Portland city attorney's office says the city doesn't comment on pending litigation.
The suit seeks $66,000 in medical bills, plus $500,000 for pain and suffering.

Unijos fights plagiarism among students
By Marie-Therese Nanlong
THE University of Jos has disclosed it will introduce plagiarism detectives in the institution to ascertain the originality of students' works as well as train students on responsible uses of internet and social media platforms.
The institution's librarian, Dr. Stephen Akintunde, made these known while presenting a paper at a workshop on Media and Information Literacy, MIL in Nigeria themed: Tackling Religious Extremism and Counter-terrorism through Media Information Literacy.
In his paper presentation titled: ICT as a tool for economic empowerment, Dr. Akintunde lamented the rate of idleness among students who while away time, fiddling with their electronic devices without deploying them to fruitful academic ventures. He stressed that such habit results into stray-thinking.
According to him, “ICT can be a silent counter to terrorism as it is a torch for economic activities. Economic empowerment engages the minds and energy and when you are empowered, you have a constructive way of exerting energy. Idleness gives way to stray-thinking and it is cancerous; it is dishuse of ICT so the University of Jos Library will train people on responsible uses of internet and social media. Plagiarism detective would be introduced in the university to ascertain the originality of students' works.”
The workshop was organised by the institution's Department of Mass Communication in collaboration with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, UNESCO and papers presented included Media Information Literacy as a proactive measure in combating internet radicalism and extremism among youths by Dr. Ismail Ibrahim of University of Lagos.

Christmas came early for users of one Lancashire library this week.
They got the best possible present when the doors to Fulwood library re-opened 14 months after it was closed in a council economy drive.
Flashback: Jane Porter (pictured with her protest petition) successfully campaigned with son Oliver, 12,for the re-opening of Fulwood library.
There to perform the official opening was one youngster whose belief the Garstang Road library would open again never wavered - 12 year old Oliver Porter.
He was invited to join Lancashire County Council leader Coun Geoff Driver to co-open the venue watched by a crowd of around 100 people.
Oliver and his mother Jane had fought a dedicated campaign against the library closure, collecting nearly 4,000 signatures for a protest petition. When the Conservatives took power at county hall in May they vowed to reopen all of the libraries which were closed by the previous administration.
Coun Driver said : “Oliver has been coming here since he as a baby and when they were closing and staff were having a farewell do with a cup of tea for the regulars Oliver was invited but said he wasn't going because it was going to reopen.”
Describing the re-opening was “absolutely fabulous”, he added: “It was a great shame it was closed. It's cost a lot of money to reopen it.”
Oliver said of his moment of fame: “It felt good - I like reading books and borrowing them from here and I like printing.”
Mum Jane, a dentist at Royal Preston Hospital, said: “I'm absolutely ecstatic. It's brilliant. Oliver's faith never wavered at all. It's brilliant for the community as well.”
Urging the public to use the library "even more" she added that, as the facility has been equipped as a multi-purpose space, it would be good to see it used for plays and other performances.
Mum Gemma Jones (pictured) was there to sign up her new twins Tilly and Stanley, as new members. and said: "I think it's wonderful because it's giving my two newest members of the family somewhere close by where they can get into books from a really early age and maybe have some fun and games if they do the baby sessions."
She added that her daughter Scarlett, three, had enjoyed attending the Baby Bounce and Rhyme sessions at the library previously.
Meanwhile veteran charity knitter Arthur Wilkinson, 84, hopes the library's knitting group will re-start. Sitting at a table, knitting a bobble hat, he said: "I learned to knit when I was ten at the end of the war when the army was coming back and a lot of them had no clothes, We had to make square patches which were sewed up to make blankets to wrap people in."
Arthur said he now makes 80 -100 bobble hats a year for a local charity and hopes a knitting group can be re-established at the library, perhaps meeting twice monthly. He said: "Twelve to 15 people used to come. I felt like crying when it closed so I was jubilant when I heard it was re-opening."
New library manager Orsolya Wilkinson said: "I feel excited about the re-opening and happy to see all the people coming in and coming back and asking about all the activities and groups they would like to re-establish, which we are more than happy to do."
An activity "wish tree" has been set up in the libary and the public are being invited to write suggestions for things they want to see happening at the library and hang their wish on the tree.
The library will be open Monday, Thursday and Friday from 9am - 5pm, on Tuesdays and Saturdays from 9am to 1pm and on Wednesdays from 9am to 7pm.

BARTOW, Fla. (WFLA) – A Jean O'Dell Learning Center employee was arrested and charged with two counts of child abuse.
On Monday, the school resource officer was advised of an incident of child abuse that occurred the previous week.
Officer Toni Strickland learned that on Dec. 4, a para-educator, identified as Pamela Murphy, was seen striking a disabled student on the face.
Based on the investigation, it was determined the incident was witnessed by another para-educator, who confirmed that she saw Murphy interacting with the 7-year-old student in the school's courtyard.
The other para-educator advised that the male student, who is non-verbal and intellectually disabled, became upset and began to kick his feet toward Murphy.
The witness said she saw Murphy strike the child on the face with an open hand.
The witness also said she observed Murphy act inappropriately with a 10-year-old disabled girl at the school.
The child had Murphy's water bottle and began to drink from it in that incident.
When she saw this, Murphy allegedly took the bottle from the child and called her a name.
She then allegedly poured the remainder of the bottle over the child's head.
No injuries were reported in either incident.
Murphy denied any wrongdoing to officers and refused to speak with investigators.
She was arrested and charged with two counts of child abuse.

(Rock Springs, Wyo. – June 14, 2017) The case of a man charged with a range of offenses stemming from a Sheriff's Office investigation was bound over to District Court at his preliminary hearing Tuesday morning in Circuit Court in Rock Springs.
Sheriff Mike Lowell said Allen James “A.J.” Hendrickson, 29, was arrested in Rock Springs on June 2 by Corporal Steve Powell on a warrant charging him with Strangulation of a Household Member, two counts of Domestic Battery (Second Offense), two counts of False Imprisonment, and Unlawful Contact Without Bodily Injury.
As described in court documents, on May 9, 2017, Hendrickson's ex-wife, was found unconscious in her vehicle at a highway underpass east of Rock Springs. She told investigating deputies that she'd gone to the underpass to help Hendrickson with a flat tire and he had “back-handed her across the face” and “has threatened to kill her and her daughter on prior occasions.”
Hendrickson's ex-wife also said that several days before, on May 6, she told Hendrickson that “she was going to leave, but he told her she wasn't allowed to leave,” and that on May 7, Hendrickson “picked her up and threw her on the floor… got on top of her and covered her nose and mouth with one hand, and grabbed her throat with his other hand…” and “choked her so hard she saw silver stars” and “while he was choking her, he told her that she was going to make him kill her” and she “was ‘going black' as if she was going unconscious.”
The documents also reference a prior instance when the victim told an investigating deputy she'd been injured by Hendrickson and describe abrasions, contusions, and bruises he observed directly.
Hendrickson remains in custody at the Sweetwater County Detention Center under a cash or surety bond of $50,000.

An Alberta-based explorer who was trapped in a partly flooded cave for days says her heart goes out to the members of a boys' soccer team as they await rescue from an underground cavern in Thailand.
Kathleen Graham, president of the Alberta Speleological Society, says she remembers “pure relief” washing over her as she emerged from the darkness of Mexico's Sistema Huautla in April.
Graham says she had to stave off panic to keep water levels steady in the one-inch pocket of air that allowed her and her team to swim out of the cave after being trapped for four days due to torrential flooding.
She says an international team of rescuers could face additional challenges as they work to devise a path to safety through the “chocolate milk”-coloured waters trapping a dozen boys, aged 11 to 16, and their soccer coach in a cave in northern Thailand.
A Thai official said Tuesday that the 13 are mostly in stable medical condition, but a forecast of heavy rains could mean the boys will have to dive out of the cave if flooding worsens.
Christian Stenner of the Alberta/B.C. Cave Rescue Service says coaching the young men to swim out of the cave could prove to be risky under conditions that would challenge even an experienced diver.
Stenner says the safest option may be to wait for water levels to recede—but spending an extended period of time underground could take a psychological toll on the group.

Dustin Johnson wrapped up his final day practice round for the U.S. Open just as the sky began to rumble and the horn sounded to stop play at Erin Hills.
The timing couldn't have been better for the world's No. 1 player, as it has been the past two weeks.
As much as he hates missing cuts, the Memorial two weeks ago was a good time for Johnson to have a weekend off. It allowed him to spend two days in Wisconsin getting to know the longest course in U.S. Open history, realizing that he would be a late arrival to Erin Hills because of some important family matters.
River Jones Johnson, his second son, was born on Monday.
He finds out Thursday whether his game is in shape for Johnson to become the first back-to-back U.S. Open champion in 28 years, but his mood couldn't be better. About the only thing to fear, outside of the thick fescue that frames the fairways at Erin Hills, is the house where he is staying.
It has a double-spiral staircase.
"I sit down when I go down the stairs now," Johnson said with a smile. "I slide down on my butt."
Stairs were the only thing that could stop him earlier this year. A winner of three straight tournaments — against the strongest fields of the year — Johnson slipped in his socks going downstairs to move his car in the rain on the eve of the Masters and bruised his back so badly that he had to withdraw the next day.
He hasn't won in four starts since then, and his game hasn't looked as sharp as it once did. He concedes he lost some momentum.
Even so, he is the betting favorite at the 117th U.S. Open on a course that would appear to suit his game perfectly, especially with more rain Wednesday afternoon and a forecast for occasional storms on Friday and Saturday. The greens are soft enough that Johnson is getting yardages to the hole, knowing his shots won't bounce away too far.
"I hope they play it all the way back on every hole," he said. "Why not? It's going to be soft. I hope it's windy. I hope it's long, but it doesn't matter."
Johnson isn't one to feel much pressure — he doesn't show much, anyway — even playing his first major as the No. 1 player in the world.
If anything, the pressure is on the USGA in how they set up the golf course, and the meteorologist to give an accurate forecast of the wind. There are a few holes at Erin Hills where if the tees are all the way back and the wind shifts into the players, some won't be able to reach the fairway or will face blind shots.
"It's nerve-wracking, honestly, more than most Open sites," USGA executive director Mike Davis said.
Johnson isn't the only long hitter whom Erin Hills favors. Rory McIlroy, who crushed U.S. Open scoring records on a rain-softened course at Congressional in 2011, was delighted to feel the soft turf under his feet.
Jason Day is starting to turn his game around, finally. Along with his power, Day is an expert with the short game, which should come in handy around the greens that feature shaved slopes instead of dense rough.
Johnson, however, is such an intimidating figure that even Curtis Strange is a little nervous.
Strange, who now works for Fox Sports as the on-course analyst, won the 1989 U.S. Open at Oak Hill to become the first player since Ben Hogan (1950-51) to win the U.S. Open in consecutive years. "Move over, Ben," Strange famously said after his second title.
"I've got to tell you, it's tailor-made for Dustin Johnson," Strange said after his first look at the course.
The Masters (three times) and the PGA Championship in stroke play (twice, by Tiger Woods) have fewer back-to-back winners than the U.S. Open, but it's the major that has gone the longest without a repeat winner.
The closest call for Strange was in 2005 when defending champion Retief Goosen had a three-shot lead at Pinehurst No. 2. He shot 81 in the final round. Four-time champion Jack Nicklaus never went back-to-back. Neither did Woods.
"You've got to be lucky, have it be the right time," Strange said. "Dustin is more dominant than anybody who has ever done it back-to-back because of his length and the whole bit. But you still have to do it."
Johnson starts out Thursday morning with the last two U.S. Open champions, Martin Kaymer and Jordan Spieth. It's a comfortable group, especially with Spieth, a close friend, his partner from the Presidents Cup and his regular pro partner in recent years at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.
Plus, he has the personality for the U.S. Open. It's a mental test, and Johnson's brain is not very cluttered. Paulina Gretzky gave birth to their second child on Monday in Los Angeles. He flew to Wisconsin on Tuesday and got in 18 holes. He played nine holes Wednesday.
Asked how he handled the range of emotions for such a whirlwind week, Johnson shrugged.
"You just do it," he said. "I wish I had an explanation on how I do it, but I don't. ... But now I've got to play golf. This is why I'm here. I'm here to play golf. I'm here to compete."
Fabinho has left little room for doubt that he intends to leave Monaco as the Ligue 1 champions look set to lose another star player.
Bernardo Silva, Benjamin Mendy and Tiemoue Bakayoko have already left, while Kylian Mbappe, Thomas Lemar and Fabinho have also been linked with departures.
For his part, Fabinho – a reported target for Manchester United – has made no secret of his desire to secure a transfer, and he reaffirmed that after Monaco's 4-1 win over Dijon.
‘I feel good, there is nothing to say about my situation, the club knows my will,' said the 23-year-old. ‘I hope we will continue this way and that Monaco will still be okay.'
The principality club's vice-president, Vadim Vasilyev, said last month that they would not sell Lemar or Fabinho in this transfer window.
He said: ‘We have kept all of the key players that we intended to keep.
‘Fabinho is a must-have player in midfield, who was being courted by all the major clubs. I will also address speculation about Lemar: he is staying with us. We have discussed this.
‘Both these players have tremendous talent and are essential for our team.
‘We must not await further departures, rather arrivals.'

The Latest on the vote by employees of Boeing's plant in North Charleston on whether to join a union (all times local):
6:45 a.m.
Voting is underway as thousands of workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant decide if they want to unionize.
Polling places opened early Wednesday morning throughout the aviation giant's sprawling facility in North Charleston. A second wave of voting takes place this afternoon.
Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to vote in the election to determine if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union initially petitioned for a vote in 2015 but called off that election because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference.
The global aviation giant came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence. Labor experts say a "yes" vote would have repercussions throughout the South, potentially inspiring other workers to think about unionizing.
———
4:10 a.m.
Nearly 3,000 production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant are deciding if they want to unionize, writing the next chapter in efforts to organize labor in large manufacturing plants across the South.
If successful, Wednesday's balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would send a significant message to politicians both in the region and Washington that workers here are demanding the same protections and benefits as their colleagues in other areas.
And, to the leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd make their jobs more difficult.
Labor experts say a "yes" vote would have repercussions throughout the South, potentially inspiring other workers to think about unionizing.
When I was writing the book, I was really mindful that I wanted people to be able to cook it easily," says A Table In Venice author, Skye McAlpine. "I get very frustrated where there are complicated ingredients that I can't get!"
This linguine recipe is a prime example of using simple and fresh ingredients that you'll easily be able to get at your local supermarket.
Not only that, but it all whips up into a dish that is way fancier than the sum of its parts.
SKYE McALPINE'S LINGUINE WITH ASPARAGUS AND PROSECCO
Method:
Step one:
Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat, then add the onion and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, over a low-medium heat for five to 10 minutes, until the onion becomes translucent.
Step two:
Add the asparagus and prosecco, then season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, for about five minutes, until all the liquid has evaporated and the asparagus is tender. If it is not quite done by the time the wine evaporates, add just enough water to cover the base of the pan and cook for a little longer. Stir in the parsley.
Step three:
Meanwhile, cook the linguine in a large saucepan of generously salted boiling water until al dente. Just before you drain the pasta, scoop half a cup of the cooking water out of the pot and set to one side. Drain the pasta, toss it back into the saucepan and mix in the reserved cooking water, little by little, and the butter. Stir well, then add the asparagus mixture. Give everything one last good stir and top with the grated Parmesan.

Delicious.magazine tips: potato-boiling methods:
Some recipes tell you to boil spuds in salted water, while others tell you to soak them in salted water first, then boil them in unsalted water. We tried both methods, using 600g peeled and halved maris piper potatoes
Batch one
We soaked these potatoes for 1 hour in water to which 2 tsp salt had been added, then drained and boiled them in a large pan of unsalted water for 20 minutes.
Result: They had a light and fluffy texture (the salt-water soak removes some starch). They didn't retain their salty flavour, though, and needed further seasoning.
Batch two
No soaking for these potatoes – we put them in a pan, covered them with water, added 2 tsp salt, then boiled for 20 minutes.
Result: These beauties held their shape better at the end of cooking and we found they were less likely to break apart. They'd absorbed saltiness from the cooking water and didn't need further seasoning.
THE VERDICT
If you're going to roast potatoes after boiling, a salt-water soak will give good fluffy/crunchiness. If they're for a salad or side dish, boil in salted water without a soak, as they'll remain firmer and be ready salted.

2 manufacturers plan expansions; 80 new jobs expected
| By
RICHMOND, Va. (AP) – Two manufacturing companies are planning expansions in Virginia, moves the governor says will lead to 80 new jobs. Gov. Ralph Northam announced Tuesday that Homestead Building Systems Inc. is planning a $2.45 million expansion of its production operation in Orange County. The manufacturer of custom-engineered lumber products says the expansion will create 60 new jobs. Also Tuesday, the governor said Provides US Inc., a manufacturer of heat exchangers, will invest nearly $900,000 to expand its operation in Augusta County. The company expects the project will create 20 new jobs. Jobs and planned expansions announced by economic development officials don't always come to fruition.
Southern Kaduna Killings, reprisal attacks for 2011 post-presidential elections killings— Miyetti Allah
*As Afenifere urges FG to break the silence
By Luka Binniyat & Dapo Akinrefon
LEADER of the Pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, Pa Reuben Fasoranti, has called on the Federal Government to condemn the killings in Southern Kaduna, faulting government's seeming indifference on the issue.
However, Senator Danjuma Laah (PDP, Kaduna South) yesterday, praised the Federal and Kaduna State governments for what he said were the massive deployment of soldiers and armed policemen to troubled areas of Southern Kaduna.
Also Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, MACBAN, Kaduna State chapter, pleaded with both Southern Kaduna natives and its members to sheathe their swords and embrace reconciliation, months after Southern Kaduna natives have accused the herdsmen of genocide.
Fasoranti
The leader of Afenifere, Pa Fasoranti, in a statement, said: “It grieves us that the Federal Government has been quiet on these killings, relying on the Governor of the state, who has openly confessed that he looked out for the killers to compensate them because they are of the same ethnic stock with him.
“A state of emergency ought to have been declared in Kaduna as the governor, by that claim, can no longer be trusted to perform his constitutional duty of protecting the lives and property of all citizens.
“We are further embarrassed by the statement credited to Mr. Femi Adesina, the President's spokesman, that our Leader has been quiet on these killings because he cannot speak on every issue.
“How can the killings of citizens in hundreds be ‘every issue'? Has our President not sent messages to other countries, where tragedies of lesser proportion occurred?”
Senator Laah
The Senator representing the area, Senator Laah, yesterday, said: “As you can all recall, I have tried alongside with my colleagues at the National Assembly to seek intervention of both the state and the Federal governments to arrest the situation. Unfortunately, these actions were met with lukewarm reactions.
“I hope the presence of these large contingents of soldier, Police and Department of State Services, DSS, will lead to the arrest of culprits so that they can be brought to justice. These kinds of horrendous crimes must not go unpunished.”
He then pleaded that a supplementary budget be made and passed into law to assist affected communities.
The Senator slammed the 24-hour curfew imposed over Jema'a, Kaura and Zangon Kataf LGAs of Southern Kaduna, saying the measure was punitive rather than for security measures.
Miyetti Allah
Meanwhile, MACBAN, Kaduna State chapter, yesterday, pleaded with both Southern Kaduna natives and its members to sheathe their swords and embrace reconciliation months after Southern Kaduna natives accused the herdsmen of genocide.
MACBAN, in corroborating Kaduna State government's position that the invasions carried out by herdsmen were reprisal killings from the 2011 post-presidential killings of herdsmen and their cattle, however, preached that reprisals would never lead to a solution to the problem.
The Assistant National Secretary of Miyetti Allah, Dr. Ibrahim Abdullahi, addressing the press in Kaduna, said some foreign Fulani were killed in Southern Kaduna in 2011 alongside local Fulani.
He said when the reprisal attacks from the Fulani started then, late Governor Patrick Yakowa of Kaduna State intervened by reaching out to aggrieved Fulani, using some members of MACABAN, which ultimately led to resolving the crisis in 2012.
He noted that Yakowa's predecessor did not continue with the policy.
He praised Governor El-Rufai for continuing with what Yakowa started, saying the ongoing killings were regrettable.

John Essey and family live in a modest, two-story home on a tree-lined street in the suburbs north of Pittsburgh. From the outside, it looks like any other house in the neighborhood, but this house has a brain.
"It knows we're home. Doors unlock, [it] kinda sets the mood for the rest of the house too, turns on lights, sets the thermostat accordingly," Essey says.
Essey is an engineer at Uber and an early adopter of the Internet of things. He can control his lights with his Amazon Echo or an array of touchpad sensors he's installed throughout the home. Sensors tell him when there's water in the basement or a leak under the sink.
While Essey's setup might sound a little like science fiction it's a prototype of the future. Some critics are worried these devices won't be secure and that companies will use them to spy on us to make money.
Gierad Laput, a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, says as the Internet of things becomes more engrained in our daily lives, there are a couple of ways people are turning ordinary homes into smart homes.
"One way is basically to buy all the appliances, smart oven, smart dishwasher, smart microwave, smart toaster, all these things," Laput says.
But that stuff is really expensive. Smart refrigerators can cost $3,000 or more. And Laput said those devices don't always talk to each other, especially if they're made by different manufacturers.
The other way is to get sensors, and put them on everything you want to monitor.
"But then those get really unwieldy and you've got all these things sticking around and they look ugly and socially obtrusive," Laput says.
So Laput and his team wanted to see if they could build just one sensor that could monitor a whole range of activity in a room. And they did. It doesn't look like much; just a little 2-inch-square circuit board that plugs into the wall. The board senses about a dozen different facets of its environment: vibrations, sounds, light color and so on. The sensor communicates wirelessly with a computer, which interprets everything it picks up.
Laput demonstrated how the sensor works by turning on a blender. Almost immediately, a text box saying "blender running" popped up on a computer screen along with a purple squiggly line representing the blender's vibration.
Laput turned on a light, and the screen said, "light on."
Laput says he imagines both domestic and commercial applications for such a sensor. It could tell you that you left your stove on or that you're almost out of paper towels in the bathroom at the restaurant you own.
But critics say there's a catch.
"Surveillance is now the business model of the Internet. Companies make money spying on you," says Bruce Schneier, an Internet security expert and the chief technology officer at IBM's cybersecurity arm. "When the app says I can detect when you're out of paper towels, they're not doing it for your best interest, they're doing it because they want to sell you paper towels."
Schneier pointed to Roomba, the little automated vacuum from iRobot. The company's CEO said last month that the device could soon start mapping your home, raising concerns that that data could be sold for a profit. The company swiftly clarified that it would only collect and share data if customers consented.
But on top of the issue of surveillance, Schneier says makers of Internet-of-things devices just aren't prioritizing security.
"We're building a world-sized robot without even realizing it," he says.
That robot has eyes and ears that collect data, brains that process it and arms and legs that take action in the real world.
But arms and legs can kick and punch, and more eyes and ears — like Laput's sensor — could make those kicks and punches both more accurate and more devastating.
2nd HALF: Mo Salah strikes as Liverpool takes 4-0 lead vs Roma
Liverpool, United Kingdom | AFP | Mohamed Salah stirred the passion of the Anfield crowd as he struck two beautiful goals and made two assist in their Champions League semifinal against Roma on Tuesday. Second half is ongoing.
Spearheaded by Salah and inspired from the touchline by exuberant manager Jurgen Klopp, Liverpool are looking to repeat the blitzkrieg attack that blew Premier League champions Manchester City away in the previous round.
But the five-time champions will still be wary of the team that staged a remarkable comeback against Spanish giants Barcelona in the last eight, overcoming a 4-1 first-leg deficit to progress to their first European Cup semi-final in 34 years.
Roma coach Eusebio Di Francesco had warned that the pace of Liverpool's prolific front three of Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino — who have combined for 83 goals this season — offers a very different threat from Barça's Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez.
“We are facing a different rival from Barcelona and we need to be ready for that different challenge,” said Di Francesco.
“We have to play our football, impose our style and make the most of Liverpool's weaknesses.

The maker of the sleep aid Ambien is calling out Roseanne Barr, after she blamed the drug for a racist tweet that resulted in the cancellation of her hit show.
On Tuesday, Barr sent out an offensive tweet about Valerie Jarrett, a former adviser to former U.S. President Barack Obama.
She was widely condemned on social media, including from people who worked with her on “Roseanne.”
Roseanne's recent comments about Valerie Jarrett, and so much more, are abhorrent and do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show. I am disappointed in her actions to say the least. — sara gilbert (@THEsaragilbert) May 29, 2018
I am hurt, embarrassed, and disappointed. The racist and distasteful comments from Roseanne are inexcusable. — Emma Kenney (@EmmaRoseKenney) May 29, 2018
I will not be returning to @RoseanneOnABC. — Wanda Sykes (@iamwandasykes) May 29, 2018
Later that day, ABC announced it was cancelling the reboot of the sitcom.
Barr apologized on Twitter and urged supporters not to defend her.
She said of the Jarrett tweet, “It was 2 in the morning and I was ambien tweeting.”
On Wednesday, the drug-maker took to social media to say racism is not a known side effect of Ambien.
People of all races, religions and nationalities work at Sanofi every day to improve the lives of people around the world. While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication. — Sanofi US (@SanofiUS) May 30, 2018
Meanwhile Jarret has said she was “fine” after the tweet and hoped the incident could become a teaching moment.
-Jan Andolan Party begins demonstrations and meetings in Delhi regarding the Gorkhaland demand.
As the Jan Andolan Party begins demonstrations and meetings in Delhi regarding the Gorkhaland demand, party leaders on Wednesday said they are firm on their stance, despite the “fact that the police have already started to trouble” them during their programmes there in the Capital city.
This is the third time that JAP leaders have camped in Delhi with a view to pressuring the Parliament to hold discussions on the demand for a separate state for the Gorkhas. “There is no point in creating chaos in the Hills as Delhi is the sole place that will ultimately hear the pleas for Gorkhaland,” a JAP leader said from Delhi.
“This is the third dharna in Delhi, and we have been stopped again, but this is the right time to raise the voice for a separate state, and this is also the right place,” JAP President Harka Bahadur Chettri said. He added that they have already been harassed by the police, “but we are firm on our thoughts and ideas.” According to JAP leaders, MPs and other leaders of national parties had assured them that they would talk Gorkhaland during the parliament's budget session that is ongoing and will last till 9 February.
“The bureau members of JAP will meet different ministers and MPs till the 9th, as they called us to have decent talks with them. We will be repeating our issue before them and we will be expecting talks about a separate state in the parliament after 5 February, as they will be very busy discussing the budget till the 4th,” Dr Chettri said.
According to the president of the women's wing of the party, they were invited by leaders in Delhi and that is the reason they are taking this Delhi visit “very seriously.” Dr Chettri later said his party does not believe in “doing bizarre activities” in the Hills. “It is Delhi that has to listen to us, and it is the parliament that has to lend us its ears,” he said.

Transcript for New questions raised about beach replenishment programs and rip currents
Back now with that new warning about rip currents and questions about what may be behind a surge in drownings especially on the east coast. ABC's gio Benitez is on the beach in Asbury park, new Jersey, with more. Good morning, gio. Reporter: Michael, good morning to you. We're talking about massive dunes created to protect and restore beaches. But now with so many drownings this summer especially right here on the Jersey shore at least one lifeguard wonders if those dunes are causing rougher surf. They're the videos we seem to be seeing more and more of, strangers jumping into action pulling struggling beachgoers out of the ocean. Rip currents partially to blame for at least 59 deaths this summer alone. And they seem to be happening on every coast with recent deaths in Louisiana, Alabama and here in New Jersey. Six rip current-related eddies in just the past two months alone, that number is usually 1 to 3 per year. In July 80 strangers came together to form a human chain saving the lives of ten people swept out by vicious rip currents. I have never seen anything like it in my entire life because without them I wouldn't have my family. Reporter: This morning new questions about what could be causing all those rough waters. A lifeguard of 50 years on the Jersey shore telling "The new York post" he thinks beach replenishment programs which refill sand dunes to protect the shore are doing what they're intended to do but he thinks they can also create more rip currents. While noaa agrees man-made jetties and piers can create hot boxes areas where swimmers are particularly at risk, what really affects the currents are waves, wind, tides and the shape of the ocean floor. The U.S. Army corps of engineers which builds those dunes saying beachfill projects neither create nor worsen rip currents. Rip currents are going to occur with equal frequency in either a natural or completely man-made beach. Reporter: Nearly 100 people die in rip currents every year in the U.S., with more than 68,000 rip current rescues last year alone. One important technique to get out of one. Instead of swimly directly to shore we'll swim diagonally. Now I can feel sand and that's it. I'm out of it. Just because I swam diagonally instead of directly toward the shore. As we take a look at the beaches of Asbury park, New Jersey, a few tips for you. Officials say don't get in the water after dark when lifeguards leave and watch for those red and yellow warning flags, August happens to be the deadliest month for rip currents. Michael. All right, thank you, gio. Some great advice here. Be careful in the water. Keep all of that in mind.

President Trump recently celebrated Easter by tweeting that the U.S. “NEED WALL” and cheering the end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program once and for all, despite the Supreme Court's recent refusal to quickly address the fate of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. Therefore, it's safe to assume that Trump is not pleased about the biggest immigration-related setback yet against the Trump administration after a federal judge laid down the law on Dreamers.
That is to say, a federal judge (and not the first one) blocked the Trump administration from ending DACA in February, but this didn't stop the federal government from officially rescinding the program in March. This placed the fate of around 700,000 undocumented immigrants into limbo, but in the meantime, the program still accepted renewal applications. The New York Times now reports that a federal court has pretty much reinstated DACA:
[A] federal judge ruled Tuesday that the government must resume accepting new applications. Judge John D. Bates of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia said the government's decision to end the program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was predicated on the “virtually unexplained” grounds that the program was “unlawful.”
Judge Bates also ruled that the U.S. government must start accepting new DACA applications in addition to the renewal-based requests, so one can expect the Trump administration to attempt an appeal to the Supreme Court. Before that happens, Bates has decided to allow Homeland Security to “better explain” its argument for ending DACA. Trump hasn't tweeted about this decision yet, but it's probably on the way soon.

All the top 2018 football prospects at St. Peter's Prep in New Jersey took advantage of the new NCAA signing period and wrapped up their recruitments in December.
Still, St. Peter's coach Rich Hansen has been kept busy lately by college recruiters.
"Duke just left. Syracuse was in this morning. Northwestern's in tomorrow. Virginia," Hansen said recently.
The day before, Rutgers coach Chris Ash and coaches from Penn State swung by the Jersey City school that has produced Alabama All-American Minkah Fitzpatrick and Notre Dame quarterback Brandon Wimbush in recent years. The previous week, Ohio State coach Urban Meyer dropped by.
"It's the same traffic. It's the same schedule," Hansen said. "The agenda just changed a little bit. But they're not going to give up an open (recruiting) period."
The first two-legged signing period in major college football began Dec. 20 and will largely wrap up on Feb. 7, the traditional first Wednesday of February. The modified agenda for schools this January has been to fill a handful of open spots in the 2018 class and get a running start on 2019 and beyond.
Several longtime, successful high school coaches gave the new recruiting calendar generally positive reviews. They were hopeful early signing would create more clarity and opportunities for their players. They said they have seen an increase in the recruitment of their remaining prospects. And while adding signing-day planning to the to-do list during playoff time was not ideal, none of the four thought it distracted players to the detriment of the team.
According to recruiting and scouting analyst Tom Luginbill of ESPN, about 2,800 prospects sign in a typical year. During the Dec. 20-22 signing period, 2,003 high school players signed with Bowl Subdivision schools. Another 360 prospects are unsigned but committed heading into next week's traditional signing day, Luginbill said.
Hansen had six players sign in December, including three of the top 20 prospects in New Jersey, according to 247 Sports' composite rankings.
"It's over and done and I can start getting the kids going to D-IIs and IIIs, and the juniors and sophomores and freshmen," Hansen said. "But if I'm on the other side of the table and I'm waiting for that offer and it hasn't come, I don't know how I'm going to feel about it."
Hansen said having most of the top prospects signed should help clear the "logjam" of prospects farther down the board that in past years would be holding out for better offers. With 10 days remaining before signing day, only 18 of 247 Sports' top 100 prospects were uncommitted. Another 13 were verbally committed, but unsigned.
Steve Mask, head coach at St. Paul's Episcopal in Mobile, Alabama, had his best player, cornerback Jalyn Armour-Davis, sign with the Crimson Tide in December. Mask's quarterback, Swift Lyle, held out, hoping that a Power Five offer might come. That's happened, Mask said. It's impossible to know if that had happened without the early signing period, but it seems like a positive sign to Mask.
"It may benefit those kids to some degree," Mask said. "The other side of that coin is it could also backfire. If Timbuktu College is a Group of Five and they're recruiting three quarterbacks and they say, 'You know what? We're going to take the first one that signs in December.' All of a sudden that kid that gambled a little bit may not have the opportunity to come back."
With college recruiters no longer having to focus on verbally committed recruits through January, guarding against last-minute flips, they have more time to take a swing at a top uncommitted recruit such as linebacker Solomon Tuliaupupu from Southern California powerhouse Mater Dei.
"That many more phone calls started to happen. That many more tweets. I guarantee these guys are coming in and (asking), 'What do you know about Solomon?'" Mater Dei coach Bruce Rollinson said.
Rollinson's team won the state championship in 2017 in a game played four days before the early signing period opened. He said he never felt as if the looming decision-day affected his players.
Kevin Wright, head coach at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida, a school that draws elite athletes of all kinds from all over the world, had 19 players sign with FBS schools in December. It didn't necessarily hurt his team, he said, but he could tell recruiters were anxious to have players signed in December.
"It definitely weighs on those kids," Wright said. "They're getting pushed hard right in the middle of the season to commit."
Rollinson said the only nuisance caused by the early signing period was trying to prepare a signing day celebration for players inking a national letter of intent in December. He said the event lost some of its luster.
"Whereas in February, we as a school try to make it as special, as we have done in the past," he said.
Mask said less attention on signing day was fine by him.
"Most people were out for the holidays. You didn't have all that fanfare," Mask said. "You didn't have ESPN using 19 channels to try to cover everybody from all over the country. And from that standpoint I thought that was a major benefit."

"Unilateral responses and threats over trade war will solve nothing of the serious imbalances in the world trade. Nothing," French President Emmanuel Macron said in an impassioned speech at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris.
In a clear reference to Trump, Macron added: "These solutions might bring symbolic satisfaction in the short term. ... One can think about making voters happy by saying, 'I have a victory, I'll change the rules, you'll see.'"
But Macron said those "who waged bilateral trade wars ... saw an increase in prices and an increase in unemployment."
Tariffs on steel imports to the U.S. can help local producers of the metal by making foreign products more expensive. But they can also increase costs more broadly for U.S. manufacturers who cannot source all their steel locally and need to import the raw material. That hurts the companies and can lead to more expensive consumer prices, economists say.
Ross criticized the EU for its tough negotiating position.
"There can be negotiations with or without tariffs in place. There are plenty of tariffs the EU has on us. It's not that we can't talk just because there are tariffs," he said. He noted that "China has not used that as an excuse not to negotiate."
But German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier insisted the Europeans were being "constructive" and were ready to negotiate special trade arrangements, notably for liquefied natural gas and industrial goods, including cars.
Macron also proposed to start negotiations between the U.S., the EU, China and Japan to reshape the World Trade Organization to better regulate trade. Discussions could then be expanded to include other countries to agree on changes by the end of the year.
Ross expressed concern that the Geneva-based World Trade Organization and other organizations are too rigid and slow to adapt to changes in global business.
"We would operate within (multilateral) frameworks if we were convinced that people would move quickly," he said.
Ross and Lighthizer seemed like the odd men out at this week's gathering at the OECD, an international economic agency that includes the U.S. as a prominent member.
The agency issued a report Wednesday saying "the threat of trade restrictions has begun to adversely affect confidence" and tariffs "would negatively influence investment and jobs."

FG to improve revenue generation through tax collection
The Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun has said that the Federal Government was focused on improving revenue generation and mobilisation through tax collection.
Kemi Adeosun briefing journalists, after the weekly federal executive council (FEC) meeting, said that she presented a memo that was approved by the FEC to sign a multilateral convention for the implementation of tax treaty related matters.
She said, “I presented a memo which was approved by council today and permission was granted to sign a multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related matters to prevent base erosion and profit shifting.
“In simple language, this administration is very focused on revenue generation and mobilisation and part of that work is to improve our tax collection. One of the means by which major companies evade is a
practice called base erosion and profit shifting which means that the profit that was made in Nigeria using accounting methods shift it to a country that has little or no tax.
“So really the country in which profit was generated doesn't get tax, they go and declare those profits in a country that has very low tax. There is a contact among the G20 countries and the OECD to end this and Nigeria was part of those who negotiated this convention and today council gave us permission to go and sign the conventions.
“What that convention would mean is that where we have existing bilateral tax treaties, like Nigeria already has some tax treaties with certain countries which actually are not in our favour and I gave
example to council.
“For example we sign a treaty with a particular country that says their national carrier will not pay tax in Nigeria and in exchange Nigeria's national carrier will not pay tax in their country but as you know Nigeria does not have a national carrier, so that type of arrangement is adverse for Nigeria.
“This convention will give us the right to go and amend that treaty and opt out of some of the treaties that we have already signed in previous administration, that are not appropriate for Nigeria. The convention allows us to renegotiate.
“The benefits are the convention will swiftly modify existing bilateral tax treaties to implement tax treaty related matters in a cost efficient manner instead of individual negotiation and amendment of the treaty. It will incorporate into existing tax treaties provisions that will prevent the granting of tax treaty benefit in an appropriate circumstance.
“It will address tax treaty abuse, promote transparency and drastically curtail illicit financial flows and ultimately it will increase the tax revenue of the government.

By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - A former Insys Therapeutics Inc sales representative was sentenced on Monday to six months of home confinement after admitting that she participated in a scheme to pay kickbacks to two Alabama doctors to prescribe a fentanyl-based medication.
Natalie Perhacs, 32, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Callie Granade in Mobile, Alabama, after pleading guilty to conspiring to pay kickbacks to the doctors to prescribe Insys' product Subsys, according to court records.
The home confinement is part of a five-year period of probation imposed by Granade, who also ordered Perhacs to participate in 300 hours of community service. Her lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.
Perhacs is one of at least 14 former Insys employees or executives to face charges related to what prosecutors say was a scheme to pay kickbacks to medical practitioners who prescribed Subsys and to defraud insurers into paying for it.
Among those charged were billionaire Insys founder John Kapoor, who has pleaded not guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other charges.
Insys has said it has taken steps to prevent past mistakes from happening again. It has said it may need to pay at least $150 million to resolve the U.S. Justice Department's probe.
Subsys is an under-the-tongue spray containing fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50 times as potent as heroin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Subsys only for treating pain in cancer patients.
Prosecutors say executives and employees at Chandler, Arizona-based Insys used sham speaker programs ostensibly meant to educate healthcare professionals about Subsys to funnel kickbacks to medical practitioners.
Perhacs, who pleaded guilty in 2016 to conspiring to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, testified at trial against the two Alabama doctors, Xiulu Ruan and John Couch.
Prosecutors said the two regularly wrote prescriptions for large quantities of addictive medications including fentanyl without a legitimate medical purpose and regularly prescribed Subsys for off-label purposes to non-cancer patients.
Prosecutors said Insys paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaker fees to Couch and Ruan, who for a time was the top prescriber of Subsys nationally.
Prosecutors said Perhacs after being hired by Insys in 2013 as a sales representative was tasked with increasing the volume of Subsys that Ruan and Couch prescribed and setting up paid speaker programs for the two doctors.
Ruan and Couch were convicted of racketeering conspiracy and other felonies and were sentenced in May 2017 to prison terms of 21 years and 20 years, respectively.

DELTA, B.C. — Police are recommending criminal charges after a father allegedly left his two young children in a vehicle outside a shopping mall in Metro Vancouver on Canada Day.
Delta police say an officer was called to the parking lot of Tsawwassen Mills where two children aged five and three were rescued by breaking a vehicle window.
Police spokeswoman Cris Leykauf says in a news release that the children were sweating and crying, and the youngest child had irregular breathing after being strapped into a car seat in the full sun.
Bystanders tried to communicate with the children to get the older child to unlock the door, but when that didn't work police were called.
Police say the children are doing well after being released from hospital.
Police say the father returned to the vehicle about 10 minutes after the children were freed.
Giancarlo Stanton took care of business right away.
Stanton hit his team-record 43rd home run, connecting in his fifth straight game and sending the Miami Marlins over the San Francisco Giants 8-3 on Monday night.
Stanton broke the club mark of 42 homers set by Gary Sheffield in 1996, doing it in the Marlins' 117th game of the season.
"When you're one homer or one hit away from a record, you don't want to let it linger because then every at-bat is, 'Is he going to do it? Is he going to do it?'" Stanton said. "So luckily I got it out of the way right away, put us on top, and able to finish."
Stanton has homered 22 times in his last 34 games.
"He's on a sick terror," Marlins second baseman Dee Gordon said. "He's amazing."
Said Giants manager Bruce Bochy: "Stanton is in one of those streaks very few power hitters have done what he's doing right now."
Stanton set another team record for most consecutive games with a home run when tagged Ty Blach (8-8) for a two-run drive in the first inning.
Blach said, "I thought I made a pretty decent pitch. He's such a strong guy."
The All-Star slugger later had an RBI single as Miami won its fourth in a row.
"For him to finally have a smile on his face and have a little charisma about himself and stop being so monotone all the time is pretty cool," Gordon said.
Marcell Ozuna also homered for the Marlins. Dee Gordon had three hits, scored twice, and drove in a run to help back Adam Conley (5-5), who allowed three runs in 6 1-3 innings.
"A lot of good things happened where you play the kind of game you like to see," Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. "Obviously Giancarlo's been incredible, but we know there's going to be nights he's not going to do it and we're going to have to be able to score runs somehow."
Denard Span's two-run double tied the game in the third and Hunter Pence's single put the Giants on top 3-2. Christian Yelich tied it with an RBI single in the bottom half.
Gordon and Stanton hit back-to-back RBI singles in the fourth. Ozuna hit a solo home run, his 27th, in the fifth.
GORDON HEATS UP
Gordon has a 10-game hitting streak at Marlins Park and is hitting .415 (17 for 41) during that span after his 16th three-hit game of the season.
Gordon led off with a single before Stanton immediately followed with a home run.
"It's been my fault the last week-and-a-half because I haven't been getting on base in front of him to start the game," Gordon said. "He's only been getting one RBI."
TRAINER'S ROOM
Giants: 2B Joe Panik was hit in the head during the second game of Sunday's doubleheader at Washington and did not play. "He's doing well," Bochy said. "He's doing just fine. He was going to get the day off anyway playing both games, all three games there in one day. We'll see in another 24 hours to make sure he is OK. Looks good right now."

8 ways to learn to accept change
In life, it's important to learn to accept the things you can't change because there's nothing more tiring, draining and frustrating than trying to change what just can't be changed. Jumia Travel, the leading online travel agency shares 8 ways to learn to accept the things you can't change.
You First Need to Accept That Things Have Indeed Changed
This is a very important step. Trying to fight change is like wrestling with a brick wall. It's useless. You need to first accept that things have changed before you can start thinking of how to deal with it.
Understand That Things Will Never Remain the Same
Once change is experienced, even if you're able to successfully fight the change, things will never fully be what they once were. You need to accept this and the feelings that come with it, and then you have to deal with it. Lying to yourself or deluding yourself into thinking that things can be exactly as they once were, is ill-advised and frankly unhealthy. Learn to accept it, deal with it and move on.
Understand That Change is an Unavoidable Part of Life
Don't dwell on why of all the people in the world, this change had to happen to you. You need to realize that change happens to everyone and avoid taking on a victim mindset. You're not the only one to experience or suffer through change. Others, many others, have experienced it and are still living. Change is a part of life that happens to everyone, and yes it might monumentally mess with things in your life, but it also brings new opportunities, lessons and experiences that can be beneficial to you and others around you.
Try To Understand What Unsettles You So Much about The Change
It's easier to deal with something tangible as opposed to something abstract and unclear. Ask yourself, search within yourself and try to answer this question – “What is it about this change that affects me so much?” If it's the death of a loved one, could it be because you fear being lonely? Or could it be that you'll miss the person's guidance or companionship? Get to the bottom of the matter and understand what about the change affects you so much.
Learn to Adapt
When you know what about the change unsettles you, it will be easier for you to find ways to fill in the gap and adapt to the new reality. If it was a mother that was lost, think of someone in your life that you consider motherly and wise. Please this is not in any way meant to replace your mother, but to only fill in the gap. If you are the kind of person that has always thrived with motherly advice and guidance, losing that all of a sudden can be extremely difficult and unhealthy for you. It'll be easier on you if you have someone to keep you grounded. If you are religious, turning to God can be a great help, especially if you have no one.
Moving on is a Process
Moving on is a process that, in truth, never ends. Once change has occurred, especially if it's a sudden change, from that day onward you are and will keep moving on. Don't expect that after a long while you will no longer feel anything. You will very much still feel things but they will not be as profound as they once were because over time you've become better at dealing with it.
Confide in Trusted Other(s) about Your Feelings
At the early stages of change and even during the moving on process, it is important to occasionally confide in someone you can trust about your feelings and struggles. It really helps more than you can imagine and is much better than trying to deal with it alone. Even if the person might not be able to fully understand your emotions, just being able to say it out loud or express it someone might just help beyond what you can imagine.
Give Yourself Permission to Be Happy Once Again
Happiness is a choice. Please try not to allow circumstances affect you so much that you actually let yourself feel some kind of guilt or unfairness about letting yourself be happy. Joy and happiness are what gives strength to deal with anything, no matter how terrible or messed up it is. Be happy not because you are happy at what happened, but because your body needs it and your mind needs it; be happy because life still continues so please give yourself permission to live.

It was with great sadness that we shared news earlier in the summer of the passing of well-known Caulkhead, Chris Weston.
A one-time mechanic on a professional cycling team, Chris had been a huge influence on Isle of Wight's cycling teams – he was passionate about the sport.
Cycling documentary
So it was no surprise to hear that seasoned editor and cameraman, Dominic Wade, had interviewed Chris back in 2015 for a documentary film he was making about the sport with Rob Wickings.
Dominic got in touch with OnTheWight last month to see if we could help with some information prior to his film – Steel Is Real But Carbon Is Quicker – being screened at the Portobello Film Festival.
We were, of course, happy to help and also pleased to subsequently hear that Dominic's film picked up the prize for Best Documentary at the festival.
‘Steel is Real but Carbon is Quicker'
Chris's interview will form part of a longer version of ‘Steel is Real but Carbon is Quicker', which is looking likely to be at least an hour or perhaps even feature length.
You can see Chris near the end of this progress edit.
Dominic is himself an enthusiastic cyclist, and spends most weekends out on the roads on one of his vintage bikes.
Find out more about the film and other work that Dominic has done by visiting his Website.
SARASOTA, Fla. (WFLA) – Sarasota police have responded to a serious crash involving four vehicles.
It happened at the intersection of Faubel Street and Higel Avenue in Sarasota.
Officials have shut down the North Bridge to Siesta Key. The bridge is expected to stay closed for several hours. Drivers nearby are advised to use the South Bridge instead.
No further details are available at this time.
This is a developing situation. We will have more updates on WFLA.com once more information is released.

THE STATE's peak motoring body is calling for community input if a push from the Queensland LNP to change speed limits on our roads bears fruit.
The State Opposition has promised to lead a review of speed limits on 100 Queensland roads if elected, with a shortlist of roads compiled with community help to be assessed by police and road safety engineers.
The former Newman Government led a similar review as part of its $350 million Road Safety Action Plan, which led to a number of increases and reductions in speed limits across the state, as well as removal of several speed changes in single stretches.
Three thousand roads were nominated by Queenslanders for that review, with the list whittled down to 100.
RELATED: Coast's deadliest roads revealed
Opposition Leader Tim Nicholls and Shadow Transport and Main Roads Minister, Glass House MP Andrew Powell pledged to run the review in a bid to bust congestion on major roads.
"Congestion costs motorists time and our economy money. Having 'fit-for-purpose' speed limits will help alleviate congestion and get Queenslanders home sooner," Mr Nicholls said.
"Depending on the outcome of the review, a road's speed limit can either increase, decrease or stay the same. In a number of cases speed limits along a stretch of road may increase and decrease to create a standard limit," Mr Powell added.
RACQ Spokeswoman Renee Smith said the organisation was supportive of the review, provided it was all about "safety and not convenience".
"Roads must be incredibly safe to increase speed limits," she said.
She said creating uniformed limits in stretches of inconsistency could be very helpful for drivers.
"If it isn't necessary, we want that consistency," Ms Smith said.

Coast Uber driver Heather Marc (pictured) said the Bruce Hwy moving to 110km/h southbound had been great, as was the Sunshine Mwy becoming 100km/h.
She thought uniformed limits on the Sunshine Mwy near the Mountain Creek exits would be helpful in boosting safety.
"That is really crazy there," Ms Marc said.
"Absolutely, I think so (uniformed speed limits could be introduced)."
She said it was hard to comment on other roads with so many roadworks on at the moment around the Coast.

BERLIN (AP) — The German government is condemning anti-Semitic incidents that took place during protests in cities across Germany in recent days.
The demonstrations were called in response to President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the announced move of the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Trump's decision has been widely condemned as undermining efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said on Monday that the burning of Israeli flags and anti-Semitic insults directed at Israel and Jews were "shameful."
Seibert said Germany feels a close affinity to Israel and Jews around the world, and will therefore counter anti-Semitic incitement whenever it occurs.
Anti-Semitism was a core part of Nazi ideology that led to the killing of over 6 million Jews in the Holocaust.
CBS Local — According to a new study out of Germany, parents might want to let their kids finish their video game before they start their homework. Researchers at Ruhr-University Bochum say that video games are actually helping students to learn faster and increase brain activity.
“Our study shows that gamers are better in analyzing a situation quickly, to generate new knowledge and to categorize facts – especially in situations with high uncertainties,” lead author Sabrina Schenk said in the university's press release. The neuropsychologists added that gamers are helping to train regions of the brain that are focused on learning and memory.
The study reportedly pitted two groups of children against each other in a learning competition that was focused on trying to predict the weather. 17 students who played video games at least 15 hours a week faced off against 17 kids who rarely play video games. The researchers found that the gamers were much better at understanding multiple factors to make the right predictions.
The children were then given an MRI, which revealed that the video game players showed more activity in the hippocampus; one of the brain's memory centers. “Changes in the hippocampus can lead to a decrease in memory performance. Maybe we can treat that with video games in the future,” Schenk said.
The new results are challenging other recent studies that found that playing video games can be helpful, but only in small amounts. A 2014 study from Oxford University found that less than an hour of video game playing a day was helpful in improving a child's emotional balance.

The opioid crisis is described now as a “national emergency” by the president. Will this open the floodgates for more funding, more help?
Last week, the president said he's declaring a national emergency of opioid abuse. What might that mean? The details are still to come, but the country is watching. 60,000 drug-related deaths predicted for the latest year. That's a 9/11 every three weeks, says Chris Christie, chairman of the president's commission on opioid abuse. So, if there's an emergency level response, where will that focus? On treatment? On police? On a wall? This hour On Point: the presidents “national emergency” on opioids. — Tom Ashbrook

From Tom's Reading List
Washington Post: Trump says opioid crisis is a national emergency, pledges more money and attention — “President Trump on Thursday declared the country's opioid crisis a national emergency, saying the epidemic exceeded anything he had seen with other drugs in his lifetime. The statement by the president came in response to a question as he spoke to reporters outside a national security briefing at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., where he is on a working vacation.”
Financial Times: Drug industry faces ‘tidal wave' of litigation over opioid crisis — “Companies that make or distribute opioid painkillers are facing a “tidal wave” of litigation as US officials seek to raise funds to fight the country's addiction epidemic and punish those they accuse of fuelling the crisis. The number of government officials launching legal action against drugmakers and wholesalers has soared in the past year in what some lawyers see as a harbinger of a settlement that could echo the more than $200bn extracted from the tobacco industry in 1998.”
NPR: What Could Happen If Trump Formally Declares Opioids A National Emergency — “The president could ask HHS Secretary Price to declare an emergency under the Public Health Service Act. Unlike FEMA, HHS doesn't have a standing emergency fund (although during last year's Zika virus scare, many people urged that one be established), but money could be freed up. Right now, public health workers and researchers are working on projects defined by grants from HHS. If Price were to declare an emergency, those workers could be redeployed temporarily, from working on AIDS outreach for example, to work on substance abuse issues.”
SAN FRANCISCO (KGTV) - A gunman shot five people at a San Francisco UPS facility Wednesday morning, killing three before turning the gun on himself.
San Francisco police said officers responded to multiple reports of people shot inside the UPS building on 17th Street and Potrero Avenue at 8:55 a.m.

Police said responding officers found multiple people with gunshot wounds, and the officers evacuated the victims from the premises.
Other officers spotted a man wearing a UPS uniform armed with an assault pistol in another part of the building. When officers confronted the man, he put the gun to his and fired, killing himself.
Police confirmed three employees died in the incident and two others were hurt, but their conditions were not immediately available.
During the police activity, the building in the Potrero Hill neighborhood was evacuated, with nearby businesses being told to shelter in place.
RELATED: Photos from UPS shooting in San Francisco
The building was declared safe just after 10:30 a.m. The shelter-in-place order for the immediate area was lifted at 11:30 a.m.
According to police, investigators believe the gunman acted alone, and the shooting was not related to terrorism. Police have not determined a motive.
Despite being dressed in a UPS uniform, police are still trying to determine if he was an employee.
Police said two firearms were recovered from the scene.
UPS issued the following statement regarding the shooting:
UPS confirms there was a shooting incident involving 4 employees within the company's facility in San Francisco earlier this morning. Local law enforcement are conducting an investigation. We cannot provide information as to the identity of persons involved at this time, pending the police investigation. We understand that there are potentially multiple deaths, although some individuals were transported to the hospital and we are unsure of their status at this time.
The company is saddened and deeply concerned about affected employees, family members and the community we share. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those touched by this incident. To assist our employees during this time, UPS has made professional counseling available.
The facility is an area package sorting hub and package delivery center.

Mel B is getting back in the game of love. After splitting from husband Stephen Belafonte, the former Spice Girl is reportedly dating a Beverly Hills cop, according to TMZ.
The 40-year-old briefly dated Eddie Murphy, who famously played the iconic starring role in the 1984 film Beverly Hills Cop. But this time, Mel B is involved with a real-life policeman. The two apparently met through mutual friends, and sources say she is nuts about him.
Reports also claim that the new couple is keeping their relationship very “low key.” He has shown up at tapings of her NBC show, America's Got Talent, in plainclothes, as well as at other social engagements.

play videoRobert Boham Beechem
Renowned gospel artiste, Robert Boham Beechem popularly known as Paa Joe Beechem has revealed the challenges associated with being a married man.
In an interview on Hello FM, he disclosed the got married at the age of 27 years and has been married for the past 16 years.
“I started music in the year 1998, it has been very tough, ever since I started gospel music, life hasn't been the same, and it constitutes happiness, disappointments and so many more”.
“Combining Ministry and music with family only takes the grace of God to steer and manage it. You should know how to plan and strategize on how to take up all the three in order not to offend one side. Family comes before anything else,” he added.
“If the family has problems the church can never rise. It's never easy to be a married man, you might be deceived into sleeping outside your matrimonial bed and know you will definitely come back to your wife. The family or a home should be peaceful and united in order for your members to have a good and honorable path to follow. Pastors sometimes go wayward and it's up to the pastor to know whether his actions serves him right”.
Pastor Beecham noted that due to his ministry, he gets the opportunity to move from one place to the other, cities to cities and when night falls and he has to rest, he's sometimes traumatized by the spirits present in hotel rooms and lodges, because one wouldn't know the previous encounters in the room before its current guest or user.
Many of these rooms have bad omen and it only takes the grace and mercies of God, he noted.
“The ministry and music brings a lot of stress and it gives an old age look due to the work. Being a gospel musician means the life and character you live should be in conformity with the bible and its teachings”, he said.
He further went on saying, “no matter the genre of music you play, it only takes the grace of God to see another day because you get to meet different people, different characters and you will have a whole lot of encounters on your path, not all human beings have good spirits”.
“As a pastor and a man of God, you will need to acquire the knowledge and wisdom of God to intervene in your daily endeavors”.
“I was the first artist to be honoured the discovery award of the year which is now the New artiste of the year in the Vodafone Ghana Music Awards (VGMA), which is a bigger blessing, It's a blessing to be honoured with awards which shows the hard and good work you institute in your music,” he said.
Fyre Fest is truly the schadenfreude that keeps on giving. The disastrous island music festival getaway was well over a year ago, but its fallout remains ongoing. Founder Billy McFarland (pictured) pled guilty to wire fraud earlier this year and recently had his bail revoked. Now the first of what could be many settlements with disgruntled festival-goers has come down.
Granted, much of the fun associated with Fyre's meltdown was watching super rich people who thought they were attending a luxury music festival in the Bahamas suffer through refugee-camp conditions, so witnessing those same people receiving multi-million-dollar legal settlements doesn't have quite the same fizz. Nonetheless, we proceed: Vice reports that North Carolina residents Seth Crossno and Mark Thompson have been awarded a $5 million settlement.
Each plaintiff was granted $1.5 million in compensatory damages plus an additional $1 million in punitive damages, according to Crossno's lawyer Stacy Miller. They had originally asked for just $25,000, citing the $13,000 they spent on a luxury VIP package promising a “residence consisting of four rooms and a living area,” but during the trial the figure was significantly inflated due to the cost of hotels and flights as well as subjective factors such as mental anguish. Crossno, a blogger who livetweeted his experience at Fyre, is now launching a podcast called Dumpster Fyre and has applied for the expired Fyre trademark.
Miller told reporters, “We feel very satisfied. We asked the court to send a message to those who defraud North Carolina consumers, and we believe he did.” When queried about McFarland's potential inability to pay up and the long line of injured parties looking to collect money from him, she added, “We feel confident about collecting. I can't tell you a whole lot about how we're going to collect it, but we feel confident about it. We have to stay mum on our strategy.”

QUINCY, Mass. (AP) — A court clerk's oversight that allowed the release of a rape suspect who later fled the country was the result of a "mistake" and was not evidence of a systemic problem, the chief justice of the highest court in Massachusetts said Monday.
Frederick Amfo, an Uber driver charged with raping a passenger, was released on bail without being required to surrender his passport because of "confusion" in the Quincy District Court clerk's office, Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Ralph Gants told The Patriot Ledger .
Gants met with court staff Monday as part of a previously scheduled visit.
Amfo, 30, posted $10,000 bail after pleading not guilty at his arraignment on April 13 and was given 24 hours to surrender his passport, but instead fled to his native Ghana, court officials have said.
It appears an employee in the clerk's office confused the protocol for people who are released on personal recognizance with the protocol for people who are required to post bail, Gants said.
The state's court system has since clarified the protocols.
"It was a mistake that was made, so we wanted to make sure there was clarification," Gants said.
Amfo was charged with raping a woman on April 8 as he drove her from Quincy to her home in Weymouth.
That woman, who has spoken publicly about the case, has called for a formal investigation into bail procedures.
Massachusetts law enforcement agencies say they are working to bring Amfo back to the U.S.

Kellyanne Conway: ‘I Don't Know Who' Tweeted ‘Love You Back' to a White Supremacist from My Account
“It's pretty hilarious that in 2017, a drawing is making the world go nuts.”
That's what artist Edel Rodriguez says about his cover for Der Spiegel magazine that broke the internet last week.
But to be fair, it's not just any drawing. It's a cartoon of President Donald Trump, standing in the pose of a Jihadist warrior. In one hand, he holds the severed head of the Statue of Liberty, which is dripping blood onto the floor. In the other hand, he grasps a bloodstained knife. Der Spiegel's online version even has an animated version of the image, with the blood dripping from Lady Liberty's head.
The image sparked fierce debate online and in the press. Germany's Die Welt daily said the cover “damages” and “devalues” journalism. Another paper, the center-right Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, wrote that equating Trump and terrorism is too simple.
The artist, Edel Rodriguez, disagrees: “I don't think you can be subtle about what's happening right now,” he said. “ I think we were subtle […] during the primary. And because of that, because the media treated it as sort of show and wasn't very serious about it, we have the president that we have right now.”
Rodriguez started doing Trump covers last year. When it looked like the Trump campaign was in a tailspin, Rodriguez drew covers for TIME magazine that showed Trump's head melting into a puddle, like the Wicked Witch of the West.
After Trump won the election, he drew a cover for Der Speigel featuring Trump's head as a fiery sun hurtling towards planet earth.
Rodriguez is already brainstorming for his next cover: “I can have Trump sitting on the Statue of Liberty's head like [Auguste Rodin's] The Thinker. And all that's in his mind is a Twitter bird!”
Or in case the president does a 180 on his political views, Rodriguez says, “maybe he's on the statue and he's sewing the head back on and we're all good again. … Or if he gets impeached, I have an image for that.”
But he's not giving spoilers on that one.
Rodriguez compares Trump to a schoolyard bully. And, he says, just like with any bully, people have to fight back.
“When I was a kid I would go outside and get in trouble with someone,” he says. “They might punch me, and I'd come home crying, and my dad would say, just go out there and punch them harder next time. That's how I grew up.”
Rodriguez spent his childhood in Havana, Cuba. He came to the United States as a refugee when he was 9 years old, on the Mariel boatlift in 1980.
Rodriguez says his experience as a political refugee informs his reaction to Trump: “Growing up in Cuba, I saw firsthand how people behave in a dictatorship. How they're afraid to talk. So when I've been here [in the US], and I've seen people do that, it jogs my mind.”
Rodriguez says he started making political art to warn people, saying, “Hey, this is very serious! this is very important! Pay attention, pay attention, please pay attention. Part of it is that I've been there and I've seen what could happen.”

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — After the terrible and very public Las Vegas massacre, people want to give and lend a hand after such tragedy.
This often means contributing to fundraisers to help the survivors and the families of the victims.
Sadly, scammers often take advantage of these moments of vulnerability to deceive donors. In addition, there are often campaigns set up by well-meaning individuals who may or may not be directly connected to the tragedy.
If you are looking to donate, and want to keep your money in the right hands the Better Business Bureaus offers some helpful tips for safe giving.
Thoughtful Giving: Take the time to check out the charity to avoid wasting your generosity by donating to a questionable or poorly managed effort. The first request for a donation may not be the best choice. Be proactive and find trusted charities that are providing assistance. Visit Give.org to verify if a charity meets the BBB Standards for Charitable Accountability. Crowdfunding: Keep in mind that some crowdfunding sites do very little vet of individuals who decide to post for assistance after a tragedy or a disaster, and it is often difficult for donors to verify the trustworthiness of crowdfunding requests for support. For more Give.org tips on crowdfunding, check out this Wise Giving Wednesdaypost. Respect for Victims and Their Families:Organizations raising funds should get permission from the families to use either the names of the victims and/or any photographs of them. Some charities raising funds for the victims of previous shootings did not do this and were the subject of criticism from victims' families. State Government Registration:About 40 of the 50 states require charities to register with a state government agency (usually a division of the State Attorney General's office) before they solicit for charitable gifts. If the charity is not registered, that may be a significant red flag. How Will Donations Be Used?: Watch out for vague appeals that don't identify the intended use of funds. For example, how will the donations help victims' families? Also, unless told otherwise, donors will assume that funds collected quickly in the wake of a tragedy will be spent just as quickly. See if the appeal identifies when the collected funds will be used What if a Family Sets Up Its Own Assistance Fund? Some families may decide to set up their own assistance funds. Be mindful that such funds may not be set up as charities. Also, if collected monies are received and administered by a third party such as a bank, CPA, or lawyer this will help provide oversight and ensure the collected funds are used appropriately (paying for funeral costs, counseling, and other tragedy-related needs). Advocacy Organizations: Tragedies that involve violent acts with firearms can also generate requests from a variety of advocacy organizations that address gun use. Donors can support these efforts as well, but note that some of these advocacy groups are not tax exempt as charities. Also, watch out for newly-created advocacy groups that will be difficult to check out. Online Caution:Never click on links to charities on unfamiliar websites or in text messages or email. These may take you to a look-alike website where you will be asked to provide personal financial information, or may download harmful malware onto your computer. Don't assume that charity recommendations on social media have already been vetted. Financial Transparency:After funds are raised for a tragedy, it is even more important for organizations to provide an accounting of how funds were spent. Transparent organizations will post this information on their websites so that anyone can find out without having to wait until the audited financial statements are available sometime in the future. Newly-Created v. Established Organizations: This is a personal giving choice, but an established charity will more likely have the experience to quickly address the circumstances and have a track record that can be evaluated. A newly-formed organization may be well-meaning, but will be difficult to check out and may not be well managed. Tax Deductibility: Not all organizations collecting funds to assist after a tragedy are tax exempt as charities under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Donors can support these other entities, but keep this in mind if they want to take a deduction for federal income tax purposes. In addition, contributions that are donor-restricted to help a specific individual or family are not deductible as charitable donations, even if the recipient organization is a charity.

BOGOTA — It was a hostile homecoming for former guerrilla leader Rodrigo Londono as he campaigned for Colombia's presidency in the coffee-growing region he abandoned four decades ago to join the rebels.
Londono's trip to his hometown of La Tebaida on Saturday was touted by his supporters as a chance to canvass for votes with a message of hope and justice for the poor.
But it was nearly wrecked before even beginning when he was chased out of the nearby city of Armenia a day earlier.
A video circulating on social media showed the moment when Londono, wearing bulletproof vest, had to be hurried out of a building by his nervous bodyguards past a small group of hecklers waiting for him. Later, riot police had to be called in to control an angry mob that to shouts of “assassin” and “rapist” pelted his armoured SUV with eggs and violently ripped off a plastic spoiler from the roof.
Londono, who is better known by his nom de guerre Timochenko, dismissed the incidents as the work of a small group of right-wing extremists bent on sabotaging implementation of the 2016 peace accord between the government and his Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.
“The smear campaign of the last 50 years produces these consequences,” he said in a statement. “It's understandable that people have prejudices. But little by little we will get our message across and change those impressions.”
While the former guerrillas have kept their promise to disarm, many Colombians are reluctant to turn a page on a conflict that left at least 250,000 dead, another 60,000 missing and more than 7 million displaced. Polls show support for Timochenko ahead of the presidential election in May hovering in the low single digits.
The nation's once-largest rebel group is now known as the Common Alternative Revolutionary Force, keeping its Spanish FARC acronym, and is guaranteed 10 seats in congress.
Timochenko secretly visited his birthplace once before since the peace agreement was signed. But his trip to La Tebaida Saturday was his first public visit to the town and his speech to a few dozen residents was peppered with references to the mistreatment of peasants he witnessed as the son of a communist shopkeeper growing up in a rural area engulfed by political violence.
“In this corner of the earth carved out by axes and machetes was where I perceived that things weren't going so well for the common people,” he said in prepared remarks. “Here the inconformity of my elders laid deep roots and taught me that I must fight if I want to see change.”

OTTAWA — The reverend for a church in the rural Ottawa community of Bearbrook is calling for the return of a bell she suspects was stolen for scrap metal last week.
Rev. Margo Whittaker says it's not clear exactly when on May 21 the 100-kilogram bell was taken from Trinity Anglican Church, but she says how it was stolen became evident when a piece of it was found on the church grounds later that day.
She says a handyman for the church found the piece of the bell on the ground, then climbed the belfry to discover it was missing.
Whittaker says the handyman then spoke to the groundskeeper, who recalled filling up a hole beside the church that was the same shape as a bell.
She says she believes at least two people used a ladder to climb up to the belfry, detach the bell and drop it to the ground, before making a getaway.
Whittaker says members of the congregation are "very upset," adding that the church has been in the community for more than 120 years.
"There are a lot of people who have history here," she said. "We have a huge cemetery and there are hundreds of people who have relatives buried in the cemetery on the church ground, and we would like to ring the bell at the cemetery service, which is coming up on Father's Day."
She said the congregation is praying that whoever took the bell will have a change of heart, or that someone will give information that will lead to its return.
"There are stories of church bells being stolen and then church bells being found," Whittaker said. "It's not unprecedented ... and that gives me hope."
Ottawa police said they have received a report on the alleged theft and investigators are checking local scrapyards.

The disruptions follow smog problems that hit much of northern China starting in mid-December. At the time, officials closed legions of factories and restricted car travel.
As Reuters notes, smog alerts are relatively typical in northern China, where the winter cold has coal power plants working hard to meet demand. However, the pollution this time around was definitely bad -- concentrations of harmful PM2.5 particles were about 50 times higher than World Health Organization guidelines. China has been eager to reduce pollution in recent years, but it's clear that existing efforts haven't been enough to prevent smog from causing serious disruptions.

Chris Jericho has pretty much been everywhere since taking his most recent leave from WWE. He's promoting a new book, a new tour with his band Fozzy, and a rock and wrestling cruise.
He's also gearing up to have his first match outside WWE in nearly two decades. On January 4, Jericho will appear at Wrestle Kingdom 12, New Japan Pro Wrestling's biggest show of the year, to have a bona fide generational dream match as he takes on Kenny Omega for the IWGP United States Heavyweight Championship.
But as it turns out, we didn't have to wait until January 4 to see these two mega-stars get physical.
The US Department of Energy (DOE) is providing up to $14.5 million (£10.4m) in new funding to advance the development of geothermal energy.
The nation has an installed geothermal capacity of more than 3.8GW and an estimated 100GW or more of potential capacity is said to be accessible.
However, technological innovation is necessary to economically convert these resources into cost-effective energy services, says the DOE.
Daniel Simmons, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy adds: “Advancing research in geothermal drilling technologies will help harness the heat beneath our feet to expand our domestic energy resources.
“Geothermal is a reliable, baseload renewable energy source with firm and flexible operation, allowing it to provide a range of essential services that contribute to our nation's grid stability and resiliency.”
Brian Hnatuk from Trumbull is pitching this season for Eastern Connecticut State University.
The Warriors are currently 12-9.
Head coach Matt LaBranche said of Hnatuk, who has appeared in eight games, starting three, “He's a guy that's a wild card and has as good of stuff as anyone on the team. We returned most of our starters from last year.”
A team strength this year lies in the fact that no less than eight everyday players are left-handed hitters, three of whom are returning starters.
In 2016, the Warriors (23-19 overall) earned their second Little East Conference Championship in three years.
The Little East tournament is scheduled for May 10-13. NCAA tournament play begins with eight regional tournaments May 17-21, followed by the national tournament in Grand Chute, WI, on Memorial Day weekend.

McLEAN, Va. (AP) - It's an annual rite in Fairfax County, which has one of the wealthiest, best-educated populations in America: Hundreds of second-graders troop off to private psychologists for IQ tests to prove they're worthy of advanced academic programs in the public schools.
The competition is fierce. Acceptance, some parents believe, can be the key to getting into prestigious Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, a magnet school that routinely sends graduates to the most competitive colleges.
"I guess I never made the cut," said Aaron Moorer, who is African-American and eventually graduated from Mount Vernon High with a 3.8 GPA. "I never made the special class."
Moorer's family wasn't aware that hundreds of families file appeals every year, armed with private exams costing more than $500, to persuade bureaucrats their child is deserving. This system exacerbates a problem plaguing gifted-and-talented programs across the nation: Black and Hispanic students almost never file the appeals that can secure their admission.
Using the Virginia Freedom of Information Act to obtain 10 years of county records, The Associated Press found that fewer than 50 black and Hispanic second-graders have filed successful appeals. That's less than 3 percent of the 1,737 second-graders admitted through the appeals process, further skewing a program already heavily weighted toward whites and Asians.
Fairfax County has the nation's 10th largest public school system, with more than 188,000 students. Of those, 25 percent are Hispanic and 10 percent are African-American. But over the last 10 years, blacks and Hispanics have constituted only 12 percent of the students deemed eligible for Level IV, the most advanced academic program.
Notably, the data show that when black and Hispanic students do submit intelligence tests, they are just as likely to gain admission as their white and Asian counterparts. The problem is that black and Hispanic students only rarely submit appeals.
Francisco Duran, the school system's chief academic and equity officer, downplayed the disparities in the appeals process, citing successful efforts to enroll more black and Hispanic students through teacher referrals and other means. But he acknowledged that the school system is not where it wants to be in terms of identifying students at an early age who have the potential for advanced academics.
"We want it to be so that we don't have a need for an appeals process," Duran said.
Looking back, Moorer is sure he could have handled more advanced classes if given the opportunity.
"Not being included in the academic program kind of left me feeling unchallenged. I was able to get straight A's but I was often left bored in class. I felt somewhat envious to know that many of the friends that I had in those classes were learning at a more advanced level," said Moorer, now an undergrad at Hampden-Sydney College. He also was accepted at James Madison University but was waitlisted at Virginia Tech and turned down by University of North Carolina.
For talented students, the stakes are high: Children in Level IV, the highest and most competitive, can be assigned to schools with concentrated numbers of gifted students, providing what many parents feel is a more robust learning environment. Lower levels, offered in neighborhood schools, may include occasional enrichment projects, outside classwork and advanced reading assignments.
The appeals culture in Fairfax is so prevalent that nearby George Mason University has graduate psychology students learn their trade by administering the tests. Ellen Rowe, the Cognitive Assessment Program's director, said sliding-scale fees make testing accessible to low-income families, but "we don't control who comes to us."
Even the lucky ones can sense the injustice. Mark Biear of Vienna, who is white, has two kids in Level IV, one of whom successfully appealed. He found that some parents discussed the process openly, while others seemed reluctant to share information might give another family an advantage.
"I wish it was more transparent," said Biear.
Jonathan Plucker, president of the National Association for Gifted Children, said Fairfax County's system "feels pretty extraordinary, but it doesn't surprise me." Wealthy, suburban districts often face intense parental demand for gifted programs, he said.
Plucker applauds the placement testing for all second-graders, but says allowing hundreds of parents to spend hundreds of dollars for a second IQ test defeats the purpose. "Why add a second level to the process that just reintroduces the disparities you're seeking to get rid of in the first place?" he asks.
Carol Horn, who ran the advanced academic program for Fairfax County Public Schools until her recent retirement, acknowledged the enrollment gap. She noted that some form of appeals process is required by the state. She initiated Young Scholars, an effort to enroll and support more minorities in advanced classes, and encouraged teachers to send more kids of color her way, which has led to more diversity.
"If parents don't know about the program, teachers become the advocate for the children," Horn said.
It's not just that appeals are costly, said Tina Hone, who advocated for minority students when she was a Fairfax County school board member. Some black and Hispanic families may be less interested in advanced placement when it means moving a child out of neighborhood school where specialized education isn't offered, she said.
"It's about cultural norms," said Hone, who is African-American. "It's not just about money."
Katherine Cespedes said teachers didn't encourage her to pursue advanced academics after she arrived in Virginia from Argentina at age 7. She said they initially focused more on developing her English-language skills.
"I don't think my teacher believed I was capable back then," Cespedes said. Only after an English teacher at Falls Church High School took interest in her did she push herself to take honors courses, graduating with a 3.5 GPA and earning a scholarship for George Mason University.
There are just a few dozen black students at Thomas Jefferson, where sophomore Alina Ampeh is surrounded by whites and Asians - a situation she's lived with since elementary school. She's grateful that all those years of advanced classes prepared her for TJ's rigorous academics, but says that doesn't necessarily make her special: She thinks many of her classmates simply have parents who worked the system. "If you want to get in, you just complain about it," she said.
Alina's mother, Karen Ampeh, also is grateful, but disappointed that so few African-Americans have benefited from such high-quality instruction.
"In my experience, the AAP program is for students who are pushed by their parents, or possibly other adults, to be in the program," she said. "It is not a welcome environment for black students unless they have a lot of support from home."

A self-driving Uber car hit and killed a pedestrian Sunday night in Tempe, Arizona, police said, in what appears to be the first case of a pedestrian death caused by an autonomous vehicle.The vehicle was in "autonomous mode at the time of the collision, with a vehicle operator behind the wheel," Tempe police said in a statement.The female pedestrian, identified as 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, was walking her bicycle across the street outside the crosswalk when she was struck, police said, adding that an investigation is ongoing.She died of her injuries at a hospital.There were no passengers in the Uber vehicle.In a briefing on Monday afternoon, police said the car was equipped with multiple cameras -- one looking forward and one facing the human driver.Police added that the driver showed no signs of impairment and that prosecutors will be looking at the case for possible charged.The vehicle was going 40 mph when it hit the pedestrian. There was no indication the car attempted to slow itself before the collision.In a statement to ABC News, Uber said, "Our hearts go out to the victim's family. We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident."In the wake of the crash, Uber has suspended its self-driving operations in San Francisco, Pittsburgh, Phoenix and Toronto, the ridesharing service said.
NEW YORK — Brook Lopez smiled through a tribute video that showed his highlights stretching back to when he played in New Jersey in red, white and blue uniforms.
Then he went out and added a few more — this time at the Nets' expense.
Lopez scored 19 points in his return to Brooklyn, making the Lakers' final basket with 1:28 left to help Los Angeles hold on for a 102-99 victory on Friday night.
The Nets' career leader in scoring and blocked shots also had a big block down the stretch as the Lakers did just enough to avoid a third straight loss.
“Brook was great tonight,” Lakers coach Luke Walton said. “He did a good job. We don't win that game without him obviously.”
Julius Randle had 19 points and 12 rebounds, and Brandon Ingram added 16 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds for the Lakers. Josh Hart finished with 15 points and 14 rebounds, helping Los Angeles to a 56-38 advantage on the boards.
Spencer Dinwiddie had 23 points, nine assists and seven rebounds for the Nets. Rookie Jarrett Allen, playing the centre spot Lopez occupied for nine seasons in New Jersey and later Brooklyn before getting dealt to Los Angeles in the trade that brought D'Angelo Russell to Brooklyn, had a season-best 20 points.
“He was the face of the franchise here and now I am here trying to become the face, too,” Allen said of facing Lopez. “Just going back and forth. I mean, it's a good challenge.”
Lopez came out on the winning end of it, blocking Allen's shot with 1:41 left to preserve a two-point lead, then scoring on a short running hook.
The No. 10 pick in the 2008 draft by the Nets, Lopez has had to navigate a new role in Los Angeles, where the Lakers like to play small and fast. But they needed his big presence in a low-scoring fourth quarter.
“It's just been different all season but I just try to stay ready,” Lopez said.
Allen was 6 for 6 for 16 points in the first half, but Lopez answered with 12 points in the third quarter, going 5 for 5 from the field with a pair of 3-pointers to send the teams to the fourth tied at 85.
The Lakers shut the Nets out for more than five minutes while scoring 11 straight to open a 96-87 lead.
TIP-INS
Lakers: The Nets played a video tribute for Lopez between the first and second quarters that included him dunking over his twin brother, Robin. “I definitely caught that,” Lopez said. “They could have like three or four more of those obviously, it happened so often.” … Kyle Kuzma was drafted with the No. 27 pick, which the Lakers acquired from the Nets in the Lopez-Russell trade. … The Lakers attended the musical “Hamilton” on Broadway on Thursday night.
Nets: James Webb III made a 3-pointer in the first half for his first NBA points. The Nets said he was the first Boise State alum to score in the NBA since Coby Karl in 2007-08. … Russell finished with 15 points off the bench.
DUNKING LIKE DAD
With Larry Nance Jr. chosen Thursday for the Slam Dunk Contest during All-Star weekend, he'll have a chance to follow in his father's footsteps — or flight path. Larry Nance was an NBA high flyer who won the inaugural event in 1984 in Phoenix.
“His dad was obviously one of the all-time best and now he's got a chance to go and show what he can do,” Walton said.
Walton also followed his father, Hall of Famer Bill Walton, to the NBA.
“Larry's obviously living his own career, he's doing his own thing, but there's something special when you get to do what your father did,” Walton added.
LIN'S INJURY
Jeremy Lin has been rehabbing in Vancouver after rupturing his right patellar tendon in the Nets' season opener. He declined to offer much specific about his treatment, but is working to not only heal the knee but also build up other parts of his body so he can come back quicker and stronger.
“To have a year off is really, how can I best maximize this time and also to put myself in a position where I'm not in this position again,” Lin said. “I mean this is sports so nothing's guaranteed, but just addressing a lot of muscle and balances, movement, deficiencies, all these different things.”
UP NEXT
Lakers: Visit Oklahoma City on Sunday.
Nets: Host Milwaukee on Sunday.

“My dad was there for me every day,” Mimi Sophia Morales, 7, says of her 2016 hospital stay as she hugs him, Zachary Morales, 25, at their Orange home. While at CHOC undergoing treatment for a dental infection, doctors discovered a baseball-sized tumor on her pancreas. Now that she's stable after months of IV antibiotics for her infection, she's undergoing a long, complicated surgery June 13 at Children's Hospital Los Angeles to remove the tumor, which doctors believe is benign.

Mimi Sophia Morales, 7, named Mimi after her grandma, is all energy as she runs through a neighborhood park, but about a year ago she was recovering from a pulpotomy for more than five days. That procedure led to doctors discovering a baseball-sized tumor on her pancreas. Now she's stable after months of IV antibiotics for her infection and is scheduled to undergo a complicated surgery June 13 at Children's Hospital Los Angeles to remove the tumor, which doctors believe is benign.

Mimi Sophia Morales, the 7-year-old who was sickened last year in a dental infection outbreak at an Anaheim clinic, is doing well after surgery to remove a large pancreatic tumor, her family and surgeon said Wednesday, June 14.
Mimi Sophia, of Orange, underwent a complex six-hour surgery at Children's Hospital Los Angeles on Tuesday. Her surgeon, Dr. James Stein, was able to save her portal vein, which was attached to the tumor and carries blood from the intestine to her liver. If he hadn't, one of her jugular veins would have been removed as a replacement.
The surgery required hooking her stomach, bile duct and pancreas back into the intestine after removal of the tumor. The tumor, which was the size of a large orange, is believed benign and pathology results are expected Thursday.
“Assuming it is benign, she should be totally cured, be able to eat normally, have totally normal growth and development,” Stein said.
Last September, Mimi Sophia underwent surgery at Children's Hospital Orange County for a severe mycobacterial dental infection that she contracted after undergoing a pulpotomy, or “baby tooth root canal,” at Children's Dental Group in Anaheim. During a CT scan, doctors discovered the tumor on her pancreas.
But before that could be removed, she needed to complete a seven-month regimen of intravenous antibiotics to knock out the infection.
“She's been really brave,” her dad, Zack Morales, said. “She's my little overcomer.”
Her grandmother, Mimi Morales, said Wednesday that Mimi Sophia is hungry and thirsty but can't eat until her stomach regains function. She has IVs in both arms and an epidural to control her pain.
“I'm feeling just gratitude and relief,” Mimi Morales said. “We're just relieved. She's one of the great loves of our lives.”
Mimi Sophia is expected to stay in the hospital for a week to 10 days.
Her family has created a Go Fund me page to help offset expenses because her dad and grandparents are self-employed and missing work while she recovers. The page can be found at: gofundme.com/3x4eyog.

Associated Press
NEW YORK (AP) - Don't tell 20-year-old Nestor Aguilera he can't effect change in politics.
The Indiana University business major protested outside President Donald Trump's recent appearance in Aguilera's home of Elkhart, Indiana. And while he says he didn't vote in 2016, he's promising to show up for this fall's midterm elections.
"If young people decide to go out there and vote, we have the power to affect what the government does," Aguilera said. "We could have a big impact."
Aguilera is among a small - but significant - surge of young people who say they feel politically empowered in the latest Youth Political Pulse survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and MTV. It's a change from a past survey that comes after a school shooting in Florida that elevated the voices of high school students in American politics, and five months before Americans will decide whether Trump's Republican Party will maintain control of Congress for another two years.
A slim majority, 54 percent, of people ages 15 to 34 - a group that is typically the least likely to vote - continue to believe they have little or no effect on government. But 46 percent of young people now believe they can have at least a moderate effect, a significant increase from two months earlier, when 37 percent said the same.
In that time, a group of students from Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a February shooting killed 17, has succeeded in keeping the debate about gun safety in the news. They joined Tuesday with the New York-based organization HeadCount in an effort to hold voter registration drives at 90 percent of the nation's high schools before this year's senior class graduates. It's one of the many efforts by organizations aligned with Democrats on gun control that seeks to capitalize on the increase in interest among young people in politics.
The recent rise in political engagement is particularly apparent among Americans ages 15 to 22, a group that includes teenagers who will be eligible to vote in a presidential election for the first time in 2020. The poll found that 48 percent now think they can have at least some effect on the government, after just 33 percent felt that way in March.
There's also an uptick in the number of young people who say politicians care what they think: 34 percent of 15-to-34-year-olds report that elected officials care at least a moderate amount about what they think, while just 25 percent said so two months ago.
At the same time, two-thirds say they think the government is not functioning well, and just over half - 52 percent - say they rarely or never read or watch news about the midterm elections.
While many young people continue to feel powerless in the current political environment, the modest increases revealed in the poll could be further evidence of a Democratic wave building against the GOP this fall. Young people are far more likely to side with Democrats than Republicans. The new poll finds that they are also especially likely to have concerns about the Republican president.
Just 30 percent of people ages 15 to 34 approve of Trump's job performance, the poll found. In April's AP-NORC survey of all American adults, 40 percent said they approved of the president's work at the White House.
On gun control, 4 in 10 teens and young adults give the government an F grade on addressing the issue. Still, gun-related issues have fallen on the list of concerns for young adults since the first Youth Political Pulse survey, which was conducted just after February's school shooting in Parkland, Florida.
Just 6 percent now list gun laws as their single top concern facing the country, down from 21 percent in March.
At least 4 in 10 young people in the latest poll also give the government failing grades on handling immigration, environmental issues, racism and higher education costs.
One poll respondent, 21-year-old Samantha Bitzer, a political science major at Michigan State University, says she's determined to encourage her friends to engage more in politics.
"I don't think that enough young people care at the moment," said Bitzer, who calls herself a moderate Republican and voted for Trump. "People are super mad, but he's actually doing everything he said he would."
Despite the rise in engagement, it's far from certain that young people will reshape the political landscape this fall. Young voters, with few exceptions, have struggled to maintain interest in politics over the last half century. Just 15 percent of eligible voters ages 18 to 20 cast ballots in the last midterm election, for example.
"Do I feel like I could actually make a difference or influence things? Probably not," said 23-year-old Charly Hyden, who works for a nonprofit in Lexington, Kentucky. "I feel exhausted. I go out on protests and try to do things, but I feel like it doesn't matter."
"Maybe I'd feel differently if I were still in high school," she said.

The Youth Political Pulse poll of 939 young Americans ages 15 to 34 was conducted April 23 to May 9 by the AP-NORC Center and MTV. The poll was conducted using NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all young people is plus or minus 4.3 percentage points.

Two men arrested for homosexuality in Lagos
Two men — Promise Oluwabunkenoye and Kehinde Abiola — on Wednesday appeared before a Surulere Chief Magistrates' Court in Lagos charged with anal sex.
The accused — ‎Oluwabunkenoye, 24, and Abiola, 29 — are facing a two-count charge of same-sex having sexual intercourse and fighting in the public‎. ‎The duo, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges.

She alleged that while the police interrogated them, one of the accused confessed to the fact that the was invited to Romeo and Juliet Hotel located at Ejigbo on May 28 at 5.00 a.m. for anal sex.
‎“He promised to pay some money if he consented to the act, but the accused refused to pay after enjoying himself.”'
‎He noted that the offences contravened Sections 54 and 136 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015 (Revised).
The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Ipaye Nwachukwu, granted bail to the accused in the sum of N100,000 each with two sureties each in like sum. She ordered ‎that the accused should submit their passport-size photographs to the court registrar.
Nwachukwu said one of the sureties must be a blood relation of the accused, while the other must be a cleric or a
community leader.
In addition, the sureties should provide evidence of tax payment to the government. She adjourned the case until August 3 for mention.

LISBON, Portugal (AP) — A small plane crashed Monday beside a supermarket near Lisbon, killing four people on board the aircraft and one on the ground. Four people were slightly injured, emergency services said.
The dead included the Swiss pilot, three French passengers on the plane and a Portuguese truck driver, emergency services operational commander Miguel Cruz told The Associated Press.
The Swiss-registered plane crashed shortly after a noon takeoff from the small Tires airfield, 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of the Portuguese capital, Cruz said. Officials said the crash happened amid clear skies and a light wind.
The Tires airfield said the plane was a twin-engine Piper PA-31 Navajo aircraft. The airfield was closed as authorities opened an investigation.
The truck driver was offloading his cargo at the supermarket's rear cargo bay, about 2 kilometers (just over 1 mile) from the runway, when the plane crashed near him. His truck was set ablaze.
Authorities declined to identify those killed in the plane until their identities could be compared with the flight plan.
The injured were shopping inside the supermarket and were treated for shock and smoke inhalation. The crash occurred about 150 meters (yards) from an elementary school.
About three dozen firefighting vehicles rushed to the scene, arriving within six minutes, according to officials. Nearby houses were blackened by smoke, with nine people forced to evacuate their homes.
Connor Cook is an untested rookie. Brock Osweiler may have a feeling he's been here before.
The Raiders and Texans square off Saturday in a playoff game that might be called The Quarterback Bowl. As in, both these teams are on uncharted roads with their QBs, and neither heads into the week of practice knowing exactly who is going to be taking snaps.
Cook entered for Oakland in Sunday's 24-6 loss against Denver after second-stringer Matt McGloin left with a shoulder injury. If McGloin, who was starting for the already injured Derek Carr, can't go next week, Cook would become the first quarterback in the Super Bowl era to make his first NFL start in a playoff game.
Osweiler could make his first playoff start, a development that seemed improbable a short year ago when he led the Broncos to the brink of the playoffs. So much has changed. On a roll after taking over for an injured Peyton Manning, he got benched for Manning in Denver's season finale last year, never to return. Osweiler signed with Houston in the offseason, but got benched there, too. And just when the Texans appeared settled on Tom Savage, Savage left Sunday's game with a concussion and Osweiler took over.
Who goes when the playoffs start?
"We'll talk about that tomorrow and the next day," coach Bill O'Brien said after Sunday's 24-17 loss to the Titans.
By those standards, the Dolphins seem stable, even though Matt Moore is also set to make his first playoff start when Miami travels to Pittsburgh for Sunday's game. Moore took over for the injured Ryan Tannehill in Week 14. He is 2-1 as a starter this year, including Sunday's 35-14 loss to New England.
So, while it looks like this season's playoffs will go down as some of the strangest ever in the quarterbacking department, it's hardly the first time. A look at some unusual situations from years past:
KAEPERNICK REPLACES SMITH: Let's start with a success story. In 2012, 49ers quarterback Alex Smith went down in midseason with a concussion, to be replaced by a not-yet-famous second-year quarterback named Colin Kaepernick. The league hadn't seen a quarterback quite like Kaepernick to that point and it showed. He led the Niners to a 5-2 record down the stretch and into the playoffs on a roll. He ran for 181 yards in his playoff debut and took San Francisco all the way to the Super Bowl, where he joined Joe Montana as the only quarterbacks to pass for 300 yards and rush for 50 in the title game. The Niners lost to Baltimore, and nothing has been the same since. Kaepernick has struggled ever since and Smith is now a (healthy) member of the Kansas City Chiefs, who won the AFC West this year.
LINDLEY FOR STANTON FOR PALMER: Ryan Lindley spent a good portion of the 2014 season on San Diego's practice squad. The Cardinals, who had originally drafted Lindley in 2012, picked him back up after their top two quarterbacks, Carson Palmer and Drew Stanton, each went down. That left Lindley at the controls for a playoff game against Carolina. It didn't go well. Lindley threw two interceptions in a 27-16 loss. The Panthers allowed 78 yards, the fewest given up in a playoff game. Arizona coach Bruce Arians on his QB's play: "I thought he did great up until the first interception."
SPEAKING OF PALMER: Though Jon Kitna doesn't get credit for a start in the 2005 playoffs, he played virtually the entire game for Cincinnati. Steelers nose tackle Kimo von Oelhoffen rolled into Palmer's knee on his first pass of the playoffs and knocked him from the game. Kitna took over and threw for 197 yards and two interceptions and the Bengals lost 31-17.
AND SPEAKING OF HOUSTON: T.J. Yates became the Texans starter in 2011 after both Matt Schaub and Matt Leinart went down. Yates actually led Houston to its first playoff victory, then its first playoff loss the next week. Maybe most significant about that season and those changes is that the Texans haven't had stability at the quarterback position since. Osweiler was supposed to bring that (at a cost of $72 million over for years), but his benching in Week 15 of this year scuttled that plan.
PEYTON MANNING, A BACKUP: Which brings us full circle. On Jan. 3, 2016, Peyton Manning suited up as a backup quarterback for the first time in his NFL career. That lasted barely more than a half. The Broncos were trailing San Diego 13-7, and though Osweiler wasn't particularly the problem, coach Gary Kubiak went with his gut and inserted Manning . The Broncos rallied for a win, got home-field advantage in the playoffs and Manning was no longer the backup. He led the Broncos to the title, and Osweiler moved on to Houston.

Access to diagnosis, key to malaria treatment— Prof Wellington Oyibo
By Chioma Obinna
WITH Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo ranking highest among malaria endemic countries in Africa, a professor of Medical Parasitology, Prof. Wellington Oyibo, has called for immediate democratisation of malaria diagnosis across the country.
Making the advocacy call in his inaugural lecture entitled: “Parasitus Facultas Et Humanum Intelligentia: The Footprints of a Medical Parasitologist in the Neglected Tropical Parasitic Diseases, NTDs, and Malaria Landscape”, Oyibo, who is Director, Research and Innovation, University of Lagos, said democratising malaria diagnosis would ensure availability and performance of a user-friendly malaria test made for the people, used by the people, and useful to the people.
Need for access
“The need to urgently escalate access to malaria testing to the communities, including the informal private sector through the private propriety Medicine Vendor, PPMVs, or Medicine Retailers who attend to over 60 percent of patients with fever is critical in attaining the malaria case management target that has the objective of ensuring that malaria test is conducted for 80 to 100 per cent of patients suspected to have malaria by 2018 and 2020.”
Oyibo stated: “Access to malaria diagnosis targeted around ease-of-use for the people will promote malaria testing and appropriate management of the conditions.
“Again, in democratising malaria diagnosis, tests that would not require invasive procedures in blood collection are likely to promote testing. Also with expanded access to malaria testing before treatment in line with paradigm shift, the use of clinical criteria would no longer be practiced.”
On laboratory –based malaria diagnosis, Oyibo explained that given the poor capacity of malaria microscopists, there are possibilities of them providing false positive malaria test results.
“Clinical diagnosis of malaria based on symptoms is not specific thereby resulting to over-diagnosis and overtreatment of malaria. One of our studies in 2013 showed 80 per cent over-diagnosis/treatment in children less than 12 years old that presented with fever in Lagos.
We again recorded a 90 percent malaria overtreatment among clients, 20 years and above who purchased ACTs from medicine retailers in six states of the country.”
He called for mandatory malaria rapid test according to WHO and National policy before treating malaria.
While recommending Malaria RDTs for diagnosis, he pointed out that malaria is a disease of public health concern in Nigeria; hence, effective case management requires early diagnosis and prompt treatment.
Further, he lamented the poor acceptance of interventions especially new technologies for malaria diagnosis, adding that the mindset of healthcare providers and the patients on malaria RDTs' performance and its outcome was a challenge in expanding access to malaria testing despite its proven performance.
“Promotion of prior testing before treatment should be escalated so that savings from excessive use of medicines from government and organisations procurements could be used to strengthen diagnostic facilities. There is need for private sector organisations to come onboard to support current elimination and pre-elimination plans for NTDs and malaria.”
On the implications of current status of malaria in Nigeria and Lagos, Oyibo said although, the data on the status of malaria in Nigeria showed that the country is in the control phase with slide positivity of 27 percent; he said there is need for the country to work harder at getting prevalence down to attain the pre-elimination phase.
He said nationally, malaria prevalence is higher in the Northern states than in the South, making the North reservoir of the parasites.

Bullion van driver, Police escort die in accident
A bullion van driver and a police officer lost their lives in an accident in Jos yesterday, when their van collided with a truck loaded with soft drinks.
It was gathered that the three other persons, who sustained injuries, were rushed to the Bingham University Teaching Hospital, Jos.
The accident, which occurred at 5.30p.m. along the Polo-Gada Biyu route, caused traffic gridlock as fear-stricken motorists and pedestrians scampered for safety with the arrival of fierce-looking security officers to guard the van.
Mr. Andrew Bala, FRSC Public Education Officer, who confirmed the death of the two people, said: “FRSC personnel are already at the scene to clear the road and ease traffic flow.”
Mr. Terna Tyopev, Police Public Relations Officer of the Plateau State Command, also confirmed the accident, but said that further details were not ready.
“I cannot tell you much about the casualties because we are still gathering information,” he said.

We shall rescue abducted pupils, Ambode vows
Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has assured parents and Lagosians of his administration's committment to security of every child in the state.
Ambode spoke last week at the grand finale of the Lagos State Schools Governor's Quiz Competition.
He spoke against the backdrop of a 14-day ultimatum issued during a protest by parents of the six abducted pupils of Lagos State Model College, Igbonla, at the Government House. The pupils were abducted by gunmen at the school premises three weeks ago.
The gunmen, who also took the principals of both junior and senior secondary schools with the pupils, have contacted the victims' parents, demanding N1 billion ransom which has been scaled down to N100 million. However, the parents are pleading that the ransom is beyond their reach.
The governor, while identifying with the victims' parents, assured that the pupils would be brought back unscathed. “Let me assure you that the government is working round the clock to ensure the release of the abducted students of Model College, Igbonla. We empathise with the students and parents and we will not relent in our efforts until the students come back unhurt to continue their education. We will not allow any group of people to distract us from our goal of educating all Lagos children and equipping them for the future,”Ambode said.
At the ninth edition of the event, which held at the Adeyemi Bero auditorium, Alausa, Lagos State Model College, Kankon, beat Alimosho Senior Grammar School and Jubilee Model Senior Grammar School to the second and third positions respectively.
The junior secondary school (JSS) and primary schools category saw Eko Junior College and Darocha Primary Schools emerging first and second runners-up respectively.
Ambode, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Mr. Adesina Odeyemi, congratulated the winners.
He recalled that the competition at the inception was designed to develop pupils' mind by creating healthy rivalry among children in public schools in the state.
“This quiz competition has over the years produced many very brilliant students, who have gone ahead to study various courses in tertiary institutions. It has broadened the horizon of participants from the preliminary levels to the finals, including the spectators and many other people who learnt from the competition,”he said.
Education sector in the state, according to him, received N205.8billion in 2016 and 2017 budgets in spite of the stiff competition for resource allocation.
“What the government has invested in the education sector of the state in the last two years is more than the annual budget of about 23 states of the federation. In fact, it is more than the 2017 budget of some four states put together,” Ambode said.
To encourage students break new grounds, he said, Lagos has unveiled a digital library to ensure access to education and the continued development of the children in the state, advising children to devote more time to their studies.
Speaking earlier, Deputy Governor, Dr. Idiat Oluranti Adebule, who was represented by the Director, Co-curricular, Mrs. Babs Akinyeye, observed that the quality of the competition has continued to grow as it progressed, praising participants' exemplary brilliance.
“The standard of questions that were posted to the pupils/students and the ease with which they answered them was a testimony to the quality of education that we provide in the state,” she said.
