Children of obese parents may be at risk for developmental delays, according to a study by researchers at the National Institutes of Health. The investigators found that children of obese mothers were more likely to fail tests of fine motor skill–the ability to control the movement of small muscles, such as those in the fingers and hands. Children of obese fathers were more likely to fail measures of social competence, and those born to extremely obese couples also were more likely to fail tests of problem-solving ability.
The study, appearing in Pediatrics, was conducted by scientists at the NIH's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).
“The previous U.S. studies in this area have focused on the mothers' pre- and post-pregnancy weight,” said the study's first author, Edwina Yeung, Ph.D., an investigator in NICHD's Division of Intramural Population Health Research. “Our study is one of the few that also includes information about fathers, and our results suggest that dad's weight also has a significant influence on child development.”
Dr Yeung and their coauthors cited research indicating that about 1 in 5 pregnant women in the United States is overweight or obese.
In the study, authors reviewed data collected from the Upstate KIDS study, which originally sought to determine if fertility treatments could affect child development from birth through age 3. More than 5,000 women enrolled in the study roughly 4 months after giving birth in New York State (excluding New York City) between 2008 and 2010. To assess development, parents completed the Ages and Stages Questionnaire after performing a series of activities with their children. The test isn't used to diagnose specific disabilities, but serves as a screen for potential problems, so that children can be referred for further testing.
ATLANTA (AP) - Brandon Nimmo and Adrian Gonzalez each drove in two runs, Jason Vargas pitched five scoreless innings and the New York Mets beat the Atlanta Braves 4-1 on Wednesday night.
It was a much-needed reprieve for the Mets, who had lost seven of nine and are 16-25 since starting the season 11-1.
The Braves had rallied to win two of the first three games in the series in the ninth inning, but they couldn't muster a comeback this time, going down in order as Robert Gsellman earned their second save.
Atlanta dropped into second place in the NL East, one-half game behind Washington, the two-time defending division champion that begins a four-game series at SunTrust Park on Thursday.
Jeurys Familia, the Mets' usual closer, avoided trouble in the eighth, getting Nick Markakis to ground into a double play to strand a runner at third.
Vargas (2-3) pitched five scoreless innings, allowing just two hits and one intentional walk with two strikeouts.
The Mets got what they needed from Vargas, who was pitching on three days' rest and began the game 1-3 with a 10.62 ERA in five starts in their first season with New York.
New York made it 2-0 in the seventh off Atlanta starter Julio Teheran (4-3) when Amed Rosario tripled with two outs and scored on Nimmo's single.
The Mets went up 3-1 in the eighth on Gonzalez's single off Sam Freeman and took a 4-1 lead in the ninth when Rosario doubled off Miguel Socolovich and scored on Nimmo's double.
New York led 1-0 in the fourth when Jay Bruce doubled and scored on Gonzalez's double.
Teheran gave up five hits, two runs and three walks in seven innings. They struck out three.
New York moved Vargas up in the rotation after Noah Syndergaard went on the disabled list with a strained ligament in their right index finger. Vargas had given up 34 hits, including six homers, with 10 walks in 20 1/3 innings in their first season with the Mets and was hit hard in a loss May 3 to the Braves in New York.
But they kept Atlanta off-balance, allowing a first-inning single to Freddie Freeman and a second-inning double to Charlie Culberson.
Tim Peterson, making their major league debut, retired the first four batters they faced before Johan Camargo hit their fourth homer in the seventh to cut the lead to 2-1.
PERFECT CONDITIONS
After the first three games had over four combined hours of delays caused by rain or the threat of a storm, Wednesday's games breezed through in 2 hours, 42 minutes. The temperature stayed in the high 70s on a clear night.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Mets: LHP Steven Matz is listed day to day, and the team hopes they won't miss a turn in the rotation with a mild strain in their middle left finger. Manager Mickey Callaway said Matz isn't expected to go on the disabled list.
Braves: RHP Mike Soroka, on the disabled list the past two weeks with a right shoulder strain, will make their first rehab appearance Friday at Class A Rome.
UP NEXT
Mets: RHP Seth Lugo (1-1, 2.48 ERA) will make their first start of the season as the Mets open a four-game home series against the Chicago Cubs. In 26 starts, he's 12-6 with a 4.09 ERA. He's 0-1 with a 9.00 ERA in one start and two relief appearances when facing the Cubs.
Braves: LHP Sean Newcomb (5-1, 2.75 ERA) is coming off no-decision last Saturday at Boston in which they lasted just three innings and gave up six hits and three runs. Before that, Newcomb had won four starts this month and allowed just one run and nine hits in 25 innings. Newcomb is 0-2 with a 9.72 ERA in two career starts against Washington.

* "Serious concerns" raised about upcoming UEFA reforms
* Agreement to avoid match clashes expires
* EPFL to hold extraordinary general assembly June 6
LISBON, March 31 Europe's professional football leagues have said that upcoming changes to the Champions League will upset the competitive balance of domestic competitions and harm the development of professional football.
The EPFL umbrella organisation, which represents 24 of Europe's national leagues, confirmed it ended an agreement with UEFA aimed at avoiding fixture clashes between domestic and European games following a decision announced in October.
EPFL president Lars-Christen Olsson also said that the growing finiancial gap between the biggest clubs and the rest was "one of the most important issues in European professional club football, at least for the last 10 to 20 years."
"What is happening is a real impact on the domestic competitions," they said after an EPFL meeting in Porto.
European soccer body UEFA last year announced reforms to the Champions League, guaranteeing four places each in the lucrative group stage to the four biggest leagues, effectively England, Spain, Germany and Italy. At the same time, the number of slots available for smaller clubs was cut.
UEFA said "financial distribution to clubs will be increased significantly" for both competitions, with the changes coming into effect from the 2018-19 season.
In a statement on Friday, EPFL said that it had "serious concerns" over the reforms which would have a "detrimental impact on the competitive balance of domestic competitions and on the development of professional football as a whole."
The agreement between UEFA and EPFL aimed at avoiding match clashes expired on March 15.
"This will give all European Leagues total freedom to schedule their matches as they see fit – including on the same days and at the same kick-off times as UEFA club competitions," EPFL said the statement.
Clubs which take part in the Champions and Europa Leagues receive generous payments and bonuses by UEFA but critics say that gives them a huge advantage over domestic rivals who do not qualify for Europe.
It also creates a snowball effect as the more teams take part in European football, the more the financial gap increases.
FC Basel won the Swiss title seven times in a row, Olympiakos took 18 of the last 20 Greek titles, Dinamo Zagreb secured the last 11 in Croatia and BATE Borisov the last 11 in Belarus.
The EPFL said it would hold an extraordinary general assembly in Geneva on June 6 "due to these extraordinary circumstances." (Writing by Brian Homewood in Zurich; Editing by Julia Glover)
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Republican-led Senate has voted to block an Obama-era regulation that would prevent an estimated 75,000 people with mental disorders from being able to purchase a firearm.
The 57 to 43 vote to revoke the regulation now sends the measure to President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it.
The Obama administration rule strengthened the federal background check system by requiring the Social Security Administration to include the names of beneficiaries with mental impairments who also have a third party to manage their benefits.
But critics say the rule was too broad and unfairly stigmatized the disabled. With a Republican ally in the White House, the GOP has moved aggressively to rescind several late Obama administration regulations.
Owner Arthur Blank of the Atlanta Falcons was asked on the NFL Channel on Friday if they want to make quarterback Matt Ryan "a Falcon for life," and took only an instant to answer in the affirmative.
"Yes, yes," Blank said. "I think what's most exciting for me, personally, is that Matt has indicated a number of times that they want to play another five-to-seven years," Blank said.
"And I think they think he's Tom Brady -- play to maybe 42, I'm not sure. That would be great, too. But Matt's been a great player for us for 10 years -- both on the field and off the field. So, I'm looking forward to having them extend their contract."
The 32-year-old Ryan, who was the third overall pick of the NFL Draft out of Boston College by the Falcons in 2008, became Atlanta's starter for the opener that season and has held the job ever since.
Ryan, who is entering the final year of their current contract, was the NFL's Most Valuable Player in 2016, when they led the Falcons to the Super Bowl -- where they suffered a heartbreaking 34-28 overtime loss to the New England Patriots after building a 28-3 lead in the third quarter.
Blank admitted putting together a deal to keep Ryan might not be easy.
"I'm not saying the money is not significant, it is significant," Blank said. "But I think they want to win championships, they want to win the Super Bowl.
"So part of what we have to keep in balance -- and Matt has to help us do that -- is that we want to sign a contract with Matt that is respectful and competitive with him, but one that positions the team to keep talent around him. ... I don't care who the player is, you can't win with one player."
Ryan, a four-time Pro Bowl selection, has a 95-63 regular-season record in 10 seasons with the Falcons plus a 4-6 mark in the playoffs, and has passed for 41,796 yards and 260 touchdowns with 126 interceptions in 158 regular-season games.
P ayments technology company dLocal , which is exhibiting at Shoptalk in Las Vegas this week, said it has expanded to North Africa while also naming Marcelo Perez as its chief financial officer. In addition, the company said Silicon Valley investor Oren Zeev has joined the board of advisors after making an investment of an undisclosed amount.
Zeev joins the company amid robust growth, dLocal said, adding that it has experienced 140 percent year-over-year revenue growth, which “enhances its ability to meet an influx in demand from global online companies for localized payment options in high-growth, emerging markets.” The company did not disclose total sales figures.
In a statement, the company said that Zeev will help guide dLocal's “further growth across Latin America, EMEA and [the Asia-Pacific] regions where the company is solving cross-border payment challenges for U.S. and European online retail , digital, SaaS and travel companies including Uber, Sony, GoDaddy, Constant Contact and Avast.”
Zeev said that emerging markets present “an enormous opportunity for many online companies, however without a localized payments strategy, those markets remain largely inaccessible to them.”
Bang & Olufsen's lifestyle arm B&O Play has unveiled its latest pair of in-ear headphones, the BeoPlay E4. The E4 are the successor to the H3 in-ear headphones and so retain their active noise cancellation status, which this time round is vastly improved.
B&O Play says the E4 headphones are capable of suppressing up to 15dB more of low frequency external noise compared to the H3s. This is mainly due to using trickle down technology from the company's BeoPlay H9 flagship over-ears which can accurately decipher what sounds are coming from the headphones and what sounds are coming from outside.
The E4 in-ears can then block the signals from the unwanted external sounds to leave you with just the music going into your ears.
Even with the improved active noise cancellation tech, B&O Play has managed to squeeze it into a smaller form factor than before. With the H3 ANCs, the battery unit was a rather large hockey puck-shaped unit, but this time round is much smaller and easier to pop into your pocket.
The BeoPlay E4 earpieces are made from aluminium to keep overall weight to a minimum and B&O supply them with memory foam ear tips to not only provide comfort, but to to ensure you get the tightest possible seal in your ears.
An intuitive gesture-controlled feature lets you turn off music and the noise cancellation, and then turn it on again when you're ready to resume

LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Theresa May is due to make an unexpected statement in Downing Street, triggering speculation that they plan to call an early election.
May's office says they will speak at 11:15 a.m. (1015 GMT) Tuesday, after the weekly meeting of their Cabinet.
Such statements are generally reserved for major news, such as resignations and election calls.
May, who took office in July after predecessor David Cameron stepped down, could be tempted to go to the polls to secure their own mandate as they negotiate Britain's withdrawal from the European Union.

But they have previously said they will stay in office until the next scheduled national election, in 2020.
Under Britain's Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, the prime minister can call an election if two-thirds of lawmakers vote for it.

Today's a day off for most Americans. A day of rest and resolutions. I've already started my diet (eat better, eat less less often). I will resume exercising which for some reason I stopped last Jan. 9. Also floss and really focus on world peace. And a more verdant world. That's a lot of stuff on one plate. But enough about me …
For lots of feds, this is just another day at the office. But what an office. Maybe the Pentagon, maybe a federal or VA hospital, maybe the CIA or the NSA. Maybe you are monitoring an airplane that is 5 miles up, moving fast and full of people.
You could be at a shipyard in Virginia or California, an air base in Nevada or Texas, or at Fort Bragg, Fort Campbell or Fort Hood.
Whatever you are doing is important. Even if nothing happens on your watch. Maybe especially if nothing happens on your watch.
So for those of us at rest, thanks. We don't know exactly what all (or even most of you) are doing, but it's nice to know you are there.
Happy New Year. Now back to the rowing machine.

PARIS (AP) — More than 50 world leaders are gathering in Paris for a summit that President Emmanuel Macron hopes will give new momentum to the fight against global warming, despite U.S. President Donald Trump's rejection of the Paris climate accord.
Some 3,100 security personnel are fanned out around Paris for Tuesday's event, including extra patrol boats along the Seine River. Macron will accompany the visiting leaders to the summit site on a river island by boat.
Sean Penn, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Elon Musk are among prominent figures joining the world leaders at the summit, which marks the second anniversary of the Paris accord.
Participants are expected to announce billions of dollars' worth of projects to help poor countries and industries reduce emissions.

Macron, who's also using the event to raise their international profile, did not invite Trump.
DUBAI: Sri Lanka lose three wickets against Pakistan as the match continued in the second session on day one of the day-night second Test at Dubai's International Cricket Stadium on Friday.
Opener Dimuth Karunaratne was on the crease having made 93 runs with captain Dinesh Chandimal, who was at 16 runs. Mendis managed to score only one run before getting out against Yasir Shah while debutant Samarawickrama scored a quickfire 38 off 35 balls before falling prey to Mohammad Amir.
Earlier, opener Kaushal Silva edged a delivery by Yasir Shah to get out for 27.
Sri Lanka beat Pakistan by 21 runs in the first Test and are eyeing Pakistan's Test record in the United Arab Emirates, where they have never lost a series in nine attempts; they have won five and drawn four series in the UAE since the 2009 Sri Lankan cricket team attack which forced them to play home matches outside the country.
For Pakistan, Yasir Shah, Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz bagged one wicket each.
Sri Lankan skipper Dinesh Chandimal won the toss and opted to bat in the second and final day-night Test against Pakistan.
The Sri Lankan team has made two changes to its lineup: Lahiru Gamage is replacing Lakshan Sandakan, and Sadeera Samarawickrama is debuting in this match, replacing the injured Lahiru Thirimanne.
Pakistan are replacing Hassan Ali with Wahab Riaz.
Sri Lanka, who lead the series 1-0 after winning the first Test in Abu Dhabi by 21 runs, gave Test caps to 22-year-old batsman Sadeera Samarawickrama and 29-year-old pacer Lahiru Gamage. This is the sixth day-night Test since Australia and New Zealand featured in the first at Adelaide in 2015.
Squads
Pakistan: Sarfraz Ahmed (c), Azhar Ali, Shan Masood, Sami Aslam, Babar Azam, Asad Shafiq, Haris Sohail, Yasir Shah, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Abbas, Wahab Riaz
Sri Lanka: Dinesh Chandimal (c), Dimuth Karunaratne, Kaushal Silva, Kusal Mendis, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Niroshan Dickwella, Rangana Herath, Dilruwan Perera, Suranga Lakmal, Nuwan Pradeep, Lahiru Gamage
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Prosecutors have brought the first criminal charges against 142 people as they aim to tamp down the growing illegal marijuana market in Los Angeles since the state legalized recreational use in January, officials said Wednesday.
The charges involve employees of 32 commercial cannabis companies and a business that delivers marijuana, said City Attorney Mike Feuer.
"The combination of significant amounts of cash and marijuana at these locations can make them dangerous," Feuer said.
Recreational cannabis businesses must be licensed by both the city and state. So far, only 147 city licenses have been issued to sell adult-use, recreational cannabis in Los Angeles. Many illegal marijuana shops operate in plain sight - out of storefronts in busy neighborhoods.
Since the beginning of the year, officers targeting illegal marijuana businesses have served 54 search warrants and arrested 160 people, which includes the 142 people charged by the city attorney, said Lt. Stacy Spell of the LAPD's Gang and Narcotics Division.
Investigators have been prioritizing going after shops that are causing crime and generating complaints from the community, they said.
"We've tried to be very responsible with taxpayer money, understanding that we have limited resources and are not able to necessarily address all of the locations," Spell said.
In addition to the misdemeanor criminal charges, the city attorney's office will also send cease-and-desist letters to other illegal cannabis businesses that prosecutors have identified, Feuer said. They declined to say how many letters would be sent.
Earlier this year, state regulators sent similar letters to about 1,000 marijuana businesses they said were operating illegally statewide.

Dennis Edwards, the lead singer of the Temptations (pictured in 1970), has died aged 74.
Dennis Edwards, the lead singer of the Temptations (pictured in 1970), has died aged 74.
Grammy-winner Dennis Edwards, who performed lead vocals for some of the chart-topping Motown singles recorded by The Temptations in the 1960s and 1970s, has died at the age of 74.
Edwards died at a hospital in Chicago on Thursday night or Friday morning of complications from an unspecified illness, their manager Toby Ludwig said by phone.
The singer, who lived outside St Louis, would have celebrated their 75th birthday on Saturday.
The Alabama-born Edwards replaced David Ruffin as lead singer of The Temptations in 1968.
Edwards sang lead on some of the vocal group's most memorable hits, including Papa Was a Rollin' Stone, a 1972 release that earned Edwards and the group two Grammy Awards, and I Can't Get Next To You, which topped the pop charts in 1969.
Edwards left The Temptations around the time the group left Motown to sign with Atlantic Records in 1977. They rejoined and left multiple times in the 1980s, when the group enjoyed far less success on the pop charts than in the previous two decades.
Edwards was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 as a member of The Temptations.

ISLAMABAD (AP) — A top official of the Pakistan Cricket Board says two players accused of involvement in spot-fixing in the Pakistan Super League tournament will face maximum punishments if they confess.
Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif arrived in Lahore on Wednesday and were scheduled to appear before the PCB's head of anti-corruption unit Col. Mohammad Azam.
“If they confessed there's no need to form a tribunal, but we will hand them maximum punishment so that nobody could do this thing in future,” PCB chairperson Shaharyar Khan told reporters.
Shaharyar said the players will be handed the charges and the PCB will give them around 14 days to respond.
“We will give evidence to them which we have against them … it's necessary to give them a chance,” Shaharyar said.
Shaharyar said the PCB was aware of the fact that bookmakers were targeting players in the PSL and that was the reason players were briefed before the inaugural match between Islamabad United and Peshawar Zalmi on Feb. 9 in Dubai.
Both accused players were part of the defending champions Islamabad United. Sharjeel played in the first match, which was under the scrutiny of the PCB's anti-corruption unit while Latif was rested.
PCB provisionally suspended both Sharjeel and Latif while another former test opener Nasir Jamshed was also provisionally suspended on Monday — the day they were arrested and then released on bail in England.
“Jamshed and another man, Yusuf, were arrested by the National Crime Agency,” a PCB official told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
The PCB official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on the issue.
Britain's National Crime Authority released an earlier statement saying two men in their 30s had been arrested on Feb. 13 and released on bail until April in connection with bribery offences as part of an ongoing investigation into international cricket match spot-fixing.
A third Islamabad United player is also under investigation and a player from each of the Karachi Kings and Quetta Gladiators franchises were questioned by the PCB's anti-corruption unit in the United Arab Emirates, where the Super League is being staged. All three players were allowed to continue playing in the tournament.
“We know what we are doing,” PSL chairperson Najam Sethi said late Tuesday.
“We have all the evidence and we knew this for a while. We had information, but we cannot talk about stuff right now, a charge sheet will be given to players soon.”
Sethi said the PCB's anti-corruption unit had information about spot-fixing before the PSL began on Feb. 9.
“We had identified a few players and then at final stages we knew the ICC had some information as well,” they said.
“When we compared it, the information was the same and then we decided to act on this.”
“We have these players' phones in which there is more information — who they were in touch with, what they talked about.”
Sethi said the cricket board's anti-corruption unit had infiltrated gambling operations in Pakistan ahead of the tournament.
It's not the first time Pakistan cricketers have been embroiled in corruption controversies. In 1999 Salim Malik and Ataur Rehman were banned for life following a match-fixing investigation.
In 2010 three players — Mohammad Amir, Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif — were suspended for five years for their involvement in the bowling of deliberate no-balls at pre-determined times during a test match in England.

TRAINER'S ROOM
Blue Jays: 3B Josh Donaldson missed their second consecutive game with right calf soreness.
Red Sox: OF Mookie Betts missed their fourth straight because of tightness in their left side that flared up during BP Sunday. "If he's OK, most likely he'll be in the lineup tomorrow," manager Alex Cora said. . 2B Dustin Pedroia also had the day off.
TWO REVERSALS
The Blue Jays challenged two safe calls with the same batter up in the third - one at second on a steal attempt and the other at the home with a runner looking to score when a pitch bounced away. Both were overturned.
FOND MEMORIES
Cora is excited to get their World Series ring before Thursday's series opener in Houston.
"It was an amazing ride," they said.
They plan to bring a jersey they wore last season as the team's bench coach, have it signed by the Astros and hang it "probably at home."
HARD SHOT
Pllate umpire Jerry Layne was dazed by a foul ball off their chest but stayed in the game. Boston catcher Christian Vazquez held up Layne when the umpire was wobbly.
UP NEXT
Blue Jays: LHP Jaime Garcia (2-3, 5.52 ERA) is scheduled to start Friday's series opener at Detroit.
Red Sox: LHP Drew Pomeranz (1-2, 6.75) is to be on the mound Thursday for the opener of a four-game series against Houston. They 0-1 with a 9.53 ERA in their last three starts and hasn't gone past four innings.

For over 50 years Piano Pat, as she's internationally known, has been tickling the ol' ivories at the Sip ‘n Dip Lounge in Great Falls.
"This legend thing blew me away. I mean I still don't know if I accept it or not people are putting me there, saying I am. I guess I am,” Pat said.
Originally, they were supposed to be a fill in for a gig she's played over five decades.
"Fate I guess. It was the guy that was playing in here's vacation, and I was supposed to be here for one week and they blew town and never came back. Before I'd played here id never played a piano bar in my life."
So, what's kept them at the Sip all of these years?
"I've met so many great people and good friends and people have been so good to me I cant describe it. They just treat me royally and that's great at my age,” they said.
The Piano Queen of the last great place has performed in front of famous people and taken hundreds of pictures with fans.
She's also seen a healthy share of the dating scene. For those looking for advice, Pat has a major key.
"If you've got time to go out and eat a meal and have some time together. Spend it together. They'll come in for a date, all they do is text. They don't even talk to each other. That bothers me,” they said.

FLY EAGLES FLY
Philadelphia improved to 11-2 and clinched the NFC East with a 43-35 victory over the Los Angeles Rams. The Eagles, who finished in last place in the division last year, completed a worst-to-first turnaround.

___
SIDELINED
Philadelphia's Carson Wentz, Houston's Tom Savage, the Jets' Josh McCown and Buffalo's Nathan Peterman each left their respective games with injuries. Two sources familiar with the injury told The Associated Press that doctors believe Wentz has torn their left anterior cruciate ligament and will miss the rest of the season and playoffs. Wentz needs an MRI to confirm the severity of the injury. Both people spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to release the information. … In Houston, Savage was cleared to re-enter the game against the San Francisco 49ers for one series after sustaining a concussion. They threw two incompletions on that drive, and Houston's team doctor approached them after they returned to the sideline after that possession. … In snowy Buffalo, Peterman went 5 of 10 for 57 yards before being sidelined by a head injury late in the third quarter against Indianapolis. … McCown left the game against Denver twice because of hard hits, including a clean shot by Shane Ray in the third quarter that left McCown with a broken left hand. … Seahawks linebacker Bobby Wagner left against Jacksonville in the third quarter with a hamstring injury and did not return. Fellow linebacker K.J. Wright (concussion) left the field late in the third quarter. … Raiders wide receiver Amari Cooper left in the second quarter against Kansas City with a right leg injury when they were blocking downfield on a run by DeAndre Washington and a defender rolled into the back of him.

The World Cancer Day, which is observed globally on February 4, should be taken as an opportunity to make health a priority in one's life.
Cancer is now one of the world's biggest healthcare challenges. Every year 8.2 million people die worldwide due to cancer, while 14 million new cancer cases are registered every year. It is the commonest cause of death in many countries and globally efforts are being made to understand its risk factors and how to prevent it.
Due to ongoing research and prevention strategies in developed countries, the number of cancer patients has gone down by 25 per cent. Unfortunately, cancer patients are increasing in the low and middle-income countries like Pakistan. This is indeed a matter of great concern.
Research conducted into this disease shows that 50 per cent of the cancers can be prevented. Smoking is among the main reasons behind the increase in cancer patients around the world, especially Pakistan. Cigarette smoking is not just responsible for lung cancer but it also causes 16 types of different cancers, thus leading to a substantial number of deaths annually. Cancer through smoking can be prevented through strict tobacco control policies.
Infections, such as hepatitis, are the second commonest cause of cancer in Pakistan. Vaccinations in this regard have proved helpful in decreasing the number of liver and gynaecological cancer patients.
Another very important cause of cancer is environmental pollution. There is a long list of chemicals which can cause cancer. Whereas, high-income countries are striving towards improving environmental pollution, Pakistan seems to be heading backwards. The number of pollution causing vehicles has increased on the roads and so have factories that flood its industrial waste in residential areas. These are all common causes of cancer. It is a recipe for disaster especially in a country like Pakistan which lacks proper resources to counter the causes of this disease. Therefore, it is the responsibility of our government and community to work together to sort out these matters as the country's top priority.
In order to avoid cancer, it is very important to lead a healthy life, irrespective of one's gender. There is growing evidence that lifestyle has a huge impact on the manifestation of cancer. Therefore, public awareness is very important. It is imperative to avoid unhealthy habits like smoking, drinking alcohol, use of chewing tobacco. Fast food and lack of exercise are the other causal factors behind cancer. Diet should be healthy and balanced which means avoiding food or drinks with artificial preservatives. In terms of food, eating fish is good for the immune system while red meat should be avoided. By leading a healthy lifestyle, one can avoid the risk of cancer to a great extent.
* Iran gas deal that India wanted likely goes to Russia
* Iraq remains the largest supplier followed by Saudi Arabia
* Middle East share of Indian supplies falls amid OPEC cuts
By Nidhi Verma
NEW DELHI, June 15 (Reuters) - India's oil imports from Iran have fallen to their lowest since June 2016, shipping data shows, in possible retaliation for Tehran not awarding a gas field development to Indian companies.
India, Iran's top oil client after China, shipped in 487,600 barrels per day (bpd) in May, about 9 percent less compared with April and nearly 40 percent less than a peak registered in October, according to ship tracking data obtained from sources and data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research & Forecasts.
Most Western-led sanctions against Tehran's nuclear programme were lifted in January last year, and India's Iranian crude imports began climbing two months later in March.
In the fiscal year to March 2018, though, India has said it plans to order about a quarter less Iranian crude due to a snub over development of Iran's Farzad B gas field.
"We stood by them in difficult times. We still buy substantial amounts of oil from them, and we expect reciprocity from Iran," Indian oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan told reporters on Wednesday when asked if India was still hopeful of getting the development rights for the Farzad B field.
Following years of seeming rapprochement over the field, Iran has likely reached an agreement on the concession with Russia's state-controlled gas giant Gazprom, Russian and Indian media have reported.
Iran last month said India had not offered an acceptable proposal on the Farzad B development.
Sri Paravaikkarasu of energy consultancy FGE said India's lower Iran imports were a "reaction of Iran's decision to award the gas field to Russia and the availability of cheaper grades like those from Russia."
India was one of four countries - China, Japan and South Korea being the other three - that continued to import large amounts of Iranian oil after sanctions were toughened in 2012.
Some of the drop in imports from Iran may be due to lower demand. Overall, India imported about 4.2 percent less oil in May, compared with April, due to a shutdown of the 180,000-bpd Bathinda refinery for upgrades.
In the first five months of 2017, India's oil imports from Iran still jumped about 64 percent, the data showed.
While Iran's oil exports to India are stalling, supplies to Europe and Turkey hit their highest level since the lifting of sanctions in 2016.
Iraq continued to be India's biggest oil supplier for the second month in a row in May, followed by Saudi Arabia.
Middle Eastern oil in May accounted for 65 percent of India's overall imports, compared to 71 percent a year ago, while the import share of Africa and Latin America have risen, the data showed.
The shift is likely a result of an effort led by the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production to prop up oil prices.

Is this the year that Queensland's decade-plus of State of Origin dominance finally ends?
Ladbrokes punters are not so sure.
NSW are clear $1.60 favourites for the 2018 series opener at the MCG following the exit of so much Origin experience in the Queensland camp led by former skipper Cameron Smith.
But the Blues have made a habit of letting punters down in recent years and the Maroons have won six of the past nine series openers as part of their run of 11 series wins in the past 12 years.
Camera Icon Valentine Holmes is paying $12 to score first in Game One. Picture: News Corp Australia, Adam Head
Ladbrokes have taken far more individual bets for Queensland to win Game 1 than NSW but all the big money has been with the Blues and they currently account for 75 per cent of the hold.
The First Try Scorer betting market is always a popular one for Origin games and Ladbrokes has an excellent offer for Game 1 — if your selection scores the first or second try, you will get paid out as a winner.
The flying Josh Addo-Carr is currently a narrow favourite at $10 from fellow Blues debutants Tom Trbojevic ($11), Latrell Mitchell ($12) and James Roberts ($12), while Dane Gagai ($12) and Valentine Holmes ($12) are the pick of the Queenslanders.
Man Of The Match is another competitive betting market and it is James Maloney ($8) that is currently a narrow favourite from Greg Inglis ($9), Damien Cook ($10), James Tedesco ($10) and Nathan Cleary ($10).
It is the big boppers in the forwards that have attracted the early interest in this market and one punter has had $100 on David Klemmer at the big odds of $51.
NRL
THERE may only be four games in the NRL this weekend but that has not stopped some serious money being thrown around.
The clash between South Sydney and Cronulla — two of the in-form teams in the competition in recent times — has been turned on its head due to State of Origin.
The Bunnies will be without Greg Inglis, Dane Gagai, Angus Crichton and Damian Cook due to Origin commitments while the Sharks will be missing winger Valentine Holmes.

Cronulla opened as $2 outsiders but there was an avalanche of money for the Sharks early in the week and that has only continued with one punter plonking $5000 on Cronulla at $1.67.
Another team that has been well-backed this week is the Eels and punters are confident they can record their third win of the season when they take on the Knights tomorrow night (SAT).
The Knights have now lost four games on the trot and are now friendless after their strong start to the season.
It is the Tigers that will go into the final game of the round as favourites but the market may have overreacted to the fact that the Roosters will be without Origin quartet James Tedesco, Latrell Mitchell, Boyd Cordner and Dylan Napa.
The Roosters still have the majority of their spine in place — most notably Cooper Cronk — and the $2.10 available does look over the odds.
AFL
Adelaide young gun Tom Doedee has rocketed into Rising Star favouritism after opening the season as a $51 shot.
He's now a red-hot $3 chance but a couple of Ladbrokes customers noticed their potential early and were able to get on at very juicy odds.
One punter had early bets of $75 at $51 and $50 at $26 which could see them celebrating a handy payout at season's end.
Lions defender Alex Witherden is next best at $4 while Sydney's Ben Ronke is another big mover.

They were massive odds of $101 earlier in the season but has come right in to $41.
Ronke's Swans take on the Blues in Friday night football and they are expected to easily account for the battling Carlton.
The Blues have lost all three of their prime time games so far this season and are 55 point underdogs to turn the tide at the SCG.
Melbourne have surged into flag contention over the past month and the current premiership betting market suggests that this will be the year the Demons break their 12-year finals drought.
They are $1.07 to make the top eight this year and are $13 into $7.50 to win their first flag since 1964.
They have got the Western Bulldogs Saturday and it is a game that has generated plenty of early interest with the Dees shortening into $1.20 after opening at $1.32.
FRENCH OPEN
Former world number one Serena Williams made a return to Grand Slam tennis this week and one Ladbrokes customer was confident she'd win the French Open straight off the racquet.
They whacked $4,800 on them at $13 but they did drift out to $15 after their first round win over Kristyna Pliskova.

There have also been a number of Ladbrokes punters keen on Simona Halep to finally claim a maiden Grand Slam title.
They have lost their last three major finals, including last year's French Open and the Australian Open earlier this year, but one punter has kept the faith and had $4000 on them to win.
Kiki Bertens was the big market mover given their terrific form on clay in the lead up.
They won the Charleston Open and made the final in Madrid which saw them backed from $41 into $21.
Ladbrokes offered $7 for Rafael Nadal to win the Men's Singles title without dropping a set — just like they did at the French Open 12 months ago.
BEST BETS
RACING — The Monstar To Win The Moreton Cup @ $4.50
They don't win out of turn but the Moreton Cup does look like an excellent race for The Monstar. They returned to the races with a credible performance at Scone and this race is weaker. Skye Bogenhuber will settle them right on the speed and this is their chance to return to winning form.
NRL — Sydney Roosters To Win @ $2.10
The Roosters will go into this clash without some key players due to State of Origin duties but the majority of their spine is still intact and that should prove key. The Tigers have struggled for consistency in recent weeks and they are always tough to trust as favourites.
AFL — Melbourne To Cover The Line (-33.5 Points)
Melbourne have won five games on the trot and they were nothing short of dominant against Adelaide. The Western Bulldogs have struggled badly against the best sides in the competition this season and they have covered the line in only three of their past 11 games as underdogs.
SUPER NETBALL — Giants Netball To Win @ $2.40
The West Coast Fever do have the home-court advantage, but there is not as much between these two sides as the current market suggests. The Fever were exposed by the Firebirds last weekend and the excellent defence of the Giants can lead them to victory.
Michigan may start tracking its sexual assault evidence kits. An amendment to the state's budget would pay for the required software and training.
The kits contain swabs and other evidence gathered from a victim of sexual assault. Software would track the kit as it moves from hospital to police department to laboratory. It also sends out alerts if a kit has been in one location too long.
“It's gonna open up an opportunity for checks and balances and that's absolutely what we need for these,” said Representative Laura Cox, R-Livonia. “These are very, very important kits.”
The program is meant to prevent a backlog of evidence kits.
Almost a decade ago, the Wayne County Prosecutor's office discovered more than 10,000 untested kits. Wayne and other counties have spent the last few years trying to reduce their backlogs. Three years ago the state passed a law that requires all evidence kits be tested quickly.
Several key stakeholders would be able to track the kits – including victims.
Jeffrey Nye is with the Michigan State Police Forensic Science Division. They said survivors should be able to keep track of where their kit is. Right now, that's not an option.
“There's no ability for the victim or the survivor to be their own best advocate to monitor that process along the way,” they said.
Debi Cain is the executive director for a state board on domestic and sexual violence. They said the tracking would empower victims.
“It gives them control of their lives in a time that all control has been taken away,” they said. “Your world has been rocked by that.”
The measure was voted out of a committee Wednesday. The next step is a vote in the state House.
NEW YORK (AP) — Jim Fitzgerald, a longtime Associated Press writer and editor in New York who helped shape the news service's coverage of stories from terror attacks to the evolving landscape of aging, died Monday. They were 66.
Fitzgerald, who worked for the AP for 43 years before retiring in December, had been fighting leukemia for more than a year and a half. They died at a New York hospital, said their wife, Ellen Nimmons, a manager at AP's headquarters.
During decades of covering New York City's northern suburbs and editing local and national stories, Fitzgerald was known for handling some of the top news of the day with a can-do demeanor, professionalism, fairness and grace. Their trademark answer to an everyday “How are you?”: “Never better.”
In a telling measure of Fitzgerald's generosity and commitment, the New York journalism organization Society of the Silurians honored them in 2014 with its Peter Kihss Award, which recognizes distinguished reporters who mentor younger colleagues.

With that award, they told the group, “I have made it to the big time.”
Fitzgerald joined the AP in New York in 1973, writing stories for radio and TV use. They moved on to what was then called the General Desk, editing stories for national and international distribution and helping supervise coverage of major news — and meeting Nimmons.
Shortly before their 1982 wedding, Fitzgerald began working in the New York City bureau as the day supervisor, the point person editing many city stories and making sure the bureau was on top of breaking news. And there would be plenty of it, including the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which killed six people and injured more than 1,000.
Eight years later, they would help cover the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, telling the stories of survivors and others. By then, they were the AP's correspondent in the city's north suburbs, an appointment made in 1996.
From their base in Westchester County, Fitzgerald covered the controversial Indian Point power plant, train crashes, a major federal housing segregation case and more.
They “brought us characters in government with all our blemishes,” but “we always knew we'd get a fair reporting,” said former Westchester District Attorney and judge Jeanine Pirro, now a Fox News personality. They said Fitzgerald's work made an impact on “how the public viewed good and evil and how they perceived the delivery of justice in our world, causing them to become engaged in the fight.”
In recent years, Fitzgerald staked out a popular beat on aging. A reporter who loved the writing part of the job, they went beyond statistics and policy to report on deeply personal, often thought-provoking aspects of growing old.
They told of senior citizens buddying up as roommates for not only savings but also for safety; “Death Cafe” gatherings of people seeking to talk comfortably about life's end; elderly drug addicts and the delicate problems involved in treating them; a “night camp” for dementia victims who don't sleep after dark; and the touching, funny, sometimes snarky messages people leave behind in prewritten obituaries.
A Bronx native and graduate of Manhattan College, Fitzgerald also was a New York Yankees fan, so loyal that they always took off work on their home opening day to be at the game.
In addition to their wife, survivors include their daughters, Bridget Fitzgerald of Mount Vernon and Caitlin Fitzgerald of Pelham, three sisters and two brothers; another brother died recently.
A Kansas House committee is considering a proposal to keep concealed guns out of public hospitals, mental health clinics and nursing homes.
The Federal and State Affairs Committee took up a bill Tuesday that would allow the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas, to continue barring concealed weapons.
A state law will require the medical center and other hospitals to allow concealed weapons in their buildings starting in July unless they have adequate security measures such as guards or metal detectors.
Committee Chairman and Abilene Republican John Barker offered an amendment to allow all public hospitals, mental health clinics and nursing homes to ban
concealed guns.
The committee did not finish its debate Tuesday.
It plans to continue its discussion and take votes Wednesday.
The 30-something-foot tree in downtown New Hamburg regularly used for the Christmas “Tree of Light” event has been cut down and taken away.
Its replacement, if all goes according to schedule, is to be planted on Tuesday, Oct. 10.
“It was time for a change,” said Reta Klaassen of the New Hamburg Lioness Club and a Tree of Light committee member. “The old tree was dying, pretty much half-dead, and never properly maintained. The town needed something new.”
This December will be the 34th year for the Tree of Light, when New Hamburg gathers at the corner of Peel and Huron Streets, where the old tree located outside the post office — beside the Centennial Fountain — was decked with Christmas lights sponsored by Wilmot people, groups or businesses.
GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — The Arizona Coyotes have claimed center Alexander Burmistrov from the Winnipeg Jets and recalled defenseman Kevin Connauton from the Tucson Roadrunners of the AHL.
The moves were announced on Monday.
Burmistrov had two assists in 23 games with the Jets this season and has 30 goals with 51 assists in 298 career games. The 25-year-old Russian was the eighth overall pick of the 2010 NHL draft by Atlanta.
The 26-year-old Connauton appeared in nine games with the Coyotes earlier this season, with one assist. They had a goal and two assists with the Roadrunners.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal government ran a $668 billion budget deficit for the just-completed 2017 fiscal year, according to a new government report. That's $82 billion more red ink than the government produced last year.
The Congressional Budget Office based its findings on preliminary Treasury reports.
The worsening deficit picture comes as Congress digs into its pockets for tens of billions of dollars more for hurricane relief. Lawmakers are also working toward a round of tax cuts that could add $1.5 trillion in debt over 10 years on top of already grim projections.
Washington isn't focusing much on the deficit these days, following the lead of President Donald Trump. The president has ruled out cuts to big benefit programs that drive the deficit's growth, and Congress has rejected most of Trump's other spending cuts.
The national debt is $20 trillion and CBO projects it would grow to about $30 trillion within 10 years. Many analysts, including CBO, worry that the nation's deficit path is unsustainable and will harm the economy by sopping up investment and pushing up interest rates.
Republicans controlling Congress are working on companion nonbinding budget plans that promise sharp spending cuts and shrinking deficits, but they aren't likely to actually try to carry out the cuts. Instead, the GOP budgets are aimed chiefly at easing the way for follow-up legislation to overhaul the tax code.
Treasury will issue the official deficit figures in a week or two.

An increasingly sophisticated hacking group is exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe's Flash Player that lets them take full control of infected machines, researchers said Friday.
The critical, use-after-free vulnerability, which is indexed as CVE-2018-4877, resides in the latest version of the widely installed Flash, researchers from Cisco Systems' Talos group said in a blog post. Adobe said separately that versions earlier than current Flash 28.0.0.137 are also susceptible. The vulnerability came to light on Wednesday when South Korea's CERT issued an advisory warning that attack code was circulating in the wild that exploited the zeroday flaw.
Talos said the exploit is being distributed through a Microsoft Excel document that has a malicious Flash object embedded into it. Once the SWF object is triggered, it installs ROKRAT, a remote administration tool Talos has been tracking since January 2017. Until now, the group behind ROKRAT—which Talos calls Group 123—has relied on social engineering or exploits of older, previously known vulnerabilities that targets hadn't yet patched. This is the first time the group has used a zeroday exploit.
"Group 123 have now joined some of the criminal elite with this latest payload of ROKRAT," Talos researchers Warren Mercer and Paul Rascagneres wrote in Friday's post. "They have used an Adobe Flash 0day which was outside of their previous capabilities—they did use exploits in previous campaigns but never a net new exploit as they have done now. This change represents a major shift in Group 123s maturity level, we can now confidentially assess Group 123 has a highly skilled, highly motivated and highly sophisticated group."
Group 123 has focused almost entirely on infecting targets located in South Korea. According to this post Talos published last month, Group 123 members speak perfect Korean and are thoroughly familiar with the Korean Peninsula region. Talos has stopped short of saying the group has ties to North Korea, but a South Korean security researcher tweeted Thursday that the Flash exploit was "made by North Korea." The researcher didn't respond to questions seeking more details.
While the number of in-the-wild attacks exploiting Flash zerodays has dropped significantly over the past year or two, the risk posed by the Adobe media player remains unacceptably high relative to the benefit it provides most users. And now that word of the vulnerability is circulating, it wouldn't be surprising for other groups to use it against a much wider audience.
Ars has long advised readers to uninstall the Flash app from their computers. For people who rely on sites that require Flash, Google's Chrome browser provides a customized version of the player that's protected by a security sandbox and can be turned on for specific sites. Adobe said it plans to release a patched version of Flash the week of February 5.
This post was updated to correct the time frame Adobe gave for fixing the flaw.
"I don't care if my kids wrestle. It's just something I did. Then they became five, six, seven years old running around," said Great Falls High wrestling coach Steve Komac.
Ever since Great Falls High's Jordan Komac got exposed to wrestling, he's been perfecting their craft. It's a process 12 years in the making and with the help from their dad and brother, Jordan's skill will continue to evolve.
"I wrestled with my brother a lot," Jordan said. "I remember when I was little Jarren and I would wrestle in the basement and my dad would see us and come in and work with us on what we did wrong."
"We probably had more wrestling matches in our basement than in our gym," Steve added.
Jordan's brother Jarren is a collegiate wrestler at the University of Providence. Jordan said wrestling someone three years older than them on a regular basis was critical in their development.
"He always knew what they were doing, they always helped me with technique, and he's a big reason why I'm the wrestler I am today," they said.
The feedback Jordan got from their brother and dad ultimately paid off. Last year, Jordan won their first double-a state championship.
"When I got it I felt like I wasn't the only one who got it. It was also my dad's title too," Jordan said.
"He was close the two years before that so it was exciting and a relief and I feel that it's helped them move forward and set new goals," added their dad.
The bar has been raised now that Jordan is a state champion. They say there's one last thing they want to achieve in their last season as a Bison.
"I've never been undefeated so it'd be pretty cool to go undefeated and get another state title and after I get it, if I get it, get ready for college."
NEW YORK (AP) — Holly Warlick and the Tennessee Lady Vols have been searching for a signature non-conference win against a top five teams for the past few years.
They got one Sunday in front of some of the best players in school history. The 11th-ranked Lady Vols (10-0) remained unbeaten after a 82-75 victory over No. 2 Texas. The win came in front of a crowd that included members of the Lady Vols' 1987, 1997 and 2007 national championship teams, who were honored at a halftime ceremony.
“We talk to our kids a lot about tradition and ‘Lady Vols For Life,'” Warlick said. “We take that really, really seriously. A lot of programs are the same, but I think what separates Tennessee is our alumni and the love they have for this program. The former Lady Vols take a lot of things personal. They're competitive. But they've been nothing but positive with this group. I was excited they could be here to watch a big win for us.”
While Tennessee is trying to re-establish itself among women's college basketball's elite teams, the current standard-bearer UConn just keeps rolling along. The No. 1 Huskies routed DePaul in their only game this week, cracking the 100-point barrier for the first time this season.
The victory was the 999th of coach Geno Auriemma's career, leaving them one short of becoming the third women's basketball coach to reach the 1,000-win mark. They could get that on Dec. 19 against Oklahoma. That same night North Carolina coach Sylvia Hatchell could get their 1,000th victory against Grambling State.
Other happenings around college basketball:
STRONG STARTS: Villanova is off to its best start since the 1979-80 season, winning its first nine games. The Wildcats held off Temple down the stretch on Sunday, winning 69-65 to equal the squad's mark from 38 years ago.
100 AND COUNTING: Rutgers crossed the 100-point mark for the first time since the 2014 season and third time under Hall of Fame coach C. Vivian Stringer on Sunday in a 101-35 win over Fairleigh Dickinson. It was the Scarlet Knights' fifth straight win and largest margin of victory since a 75-point victory over Duquesne on Jan. 9, 1988.
POLL WATCH: It was a rough week for No. 20 Kentucky, which lost to both Florida Gulf Coast and Miami. The Wildcats are in danger of falling out of the poll this week.
BONUS BASKETBALL: For the second time in three games Drake lost a game in overtime. The Bulldogs fell to Creighton on Dec. 3 in four overtimes. Drake then lost on Saturday to Nebraska, 89-84, in two OTs. Sandwiched between those games was a 77-point win over Iowa Wesleyan.
SUSPENDED: St. Norbert College said its women's basketball team won't play the next 10 games because of an alcohol-related incident involving some players.
School leaders say the college began an investigation after learning about the incident approximately three weeks ago. The decision to suspend the players involved was made by the school and its judicial board and not by the league office. Officials say the school was unable to field a team because too many players were involved.
The Green Knights will also be ineligible for the Midwest Conference tournament and the regular-season championship. The team's first game back will be at Cornell on Jan. 27.

Oklahoma City police are looking for two people who may be able to lead investigators to solving a homicide.
Oklahoma City police are looking for two people who may be able to lead investigators to solving a homicide.
On Jan. 25, Antwon Chamblee, 23, was shot and killed . They were found on the front lawn of 6616 S. Kelley Avenue.
Chamblee's mother told News 9 they are devastated by the loss of their son. They said Chamblee is survived by an older brother and two younger sisters. They want those responsible off the streets.
Police released screen shots from surveillance videos at a convenience store near SE 66 Street and Interstate 35 . Police said the video is from less than an hour before Chamblee was killed.
A black or dark blue Dodge Charger with a spoiler and paper tags pulled up to the store. Three people got out of the car, including Chamblee, and entered the convenience store. One person stayed in the car.
All four individuals left the store and minutes later, police were called to the corner of SE 66 and Kelley where Chamblee was found with gunshot wounds. They were taken to the hospital where they died.
At this point, police have not indicated their connection with the crime. They want to talk to the individuals because police believe they have crucial details about the death.
Anyone with information is asked to contact the homicide tip line at (405) 297-1200.
Technical delegates from international federations have completed a two day visit to San Diego as preparations for the inaugural Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) World Beach Games continue.
ANOC said the visit was to give delegates a chance to assess the proposed venues for their competitions at the Games in the American city.
Delegates will now be able to give feedback on the existing plans, with the visit coinciding with the full confirmation of the final list of 15 sports and 17 disciplines for the Games.
Aquathlon, a combination of running and swimming, was proposed as the sole triathlon discipline, while a five kilometres open water swimming race was also included.
BMX cycling, bouldering, beach handball, kata karate, kitefoil sailing, park skateboarding, beach soccer, beach tennis, 3x3 basketball, beach volleyball 4x4 and beach wrestling also feature.
Shortboard and longboard surfing events are now proposed, along with water ski jumping and wakeboarding.
It has been claimed that delegates were impressed by the size and space of Mission Beach, where competition venues and practice areas will be located.
ANOC said the federations will have enough space to hold their events, but they have also ensured that all competitions will be hosted in one area, allowing fans to easily walk between venues.
All of the federations present had meetings with ANOC and San Diego 2019 to further discuss plans for their sports.
The meetings gave governing bodies the opportunity to suggest amendments to ensure athletes have the best experience.
A general overview of the Games concept and plan was presented to each delegate present.
The visit coincided with confirmation of the full sport programme for the Games ©ANOC
This included a review of the field of play, along with information on preparation areas, medical plans, media provision, equipment, accommodation, transport, doping controls and visa guidelines.
Hotels which will be used to accommodate athletes and officials during the Games were also toured by officials.
It is anticipated that the 15 sports will bring together approximately 1,300 athletes from every Olympic continent during six days of competition.
It is not expected that every National Olympic Committee (NOC) will participate in the sporting competition.
However, all 206 of the world's NOCs would be expected to be represented at the ANOC General Assembly taking place alongside the Games.
The event was initially due to take place in 2017 but two years ago was pushed back to 2019 to allow more time for preparations.
William and Kate aren't the only famous family welcoming their third child!
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and their partner Lauren Hashian have announced the birth of their daughter, named Tiana.
They posted a picture on Instagram of themselves holding their gorgeous newborn. They also had some advice for expectant fathers, including:
Word to the wise gentlemen, it's critical to be by your lady's head when she's delivering, being as supportive as you can.. holding hands, holding legs, whatever you can do. But, if you really want to understand the single most powerful and primal moment life will ever offer - watch your child being born. Its a life changer and the respect and admiration you have for a woman, will forever be boundless.
So they were down the business end, which is great as long as Lauren was okay with that. Them Fionnuala, them rules.
I have 6 words: Stay away from the business end.
And in other showbiz news from around the world:
Nadine Coyle has cancelled their upcoming tour of Ireland and the UK.

Despite the variety of restaurants in our region there aren't many places to enjoy a full service Mexican meal. Luckily, Cambridge's Latinoamerica Unida expanded into Waterloo in March of this year and opened The Cactus.
We visited the restaurant on a Wednesday in late September and although it was quiet when we arrived, it was busy by the time we left. As we came in there were several tables available so we were invited to sit wherever we chose.
There are booths along one wall of the room, with several tables in the middle and along the other side wall. The tables are unadorned, and the restaurant is sparingly decorated with tiles, multiple colours of paint, and large cacti painted on one wall. The bar at the back of the room is attractively adorned with decorative tiles and lighting.
The server who brought our menus to the table acted as host, server, bartender, and at times appeared to be helping out in the kitchen. As I discovered later, they are co-owner of the restaurants along with their wife. Given the number of people who began arriving, both for dining in and takeout, they could definitely use some help out front.
We were not given a drinks menu so ordered our beverages using a question and answer process. My husband decided on a bottle of Mexican beer ($5.99), I chose an organic Sauvignon Blanc ($6.99 for 8 oz.) and my daughter ordered a large soft drink ($2.50). I later noticed other diners were enjoying margaritas, and I would definitely try one if I returned.
The food menu includes several appetizers, along with a good variety of burritos, tacos, and "Traditional Plates" which include enchiladas and chimichangas. The listed items are accompanied by detailed descriptions which were helpful as we didn't have much opportunity to ask questions.
For appetizers, we chose two dips to share: the Guacamole ($8.99) and the Frijoles Refrito con Queso ($7.99). They arrived very quickly after we ordered and were large enough for the three of us to share, with some left over.
The guacamole was creamy and fresh, sprinkled with chopped fresh tomatoes and onions. The frijoles consisted of refried beans, spices and cheese baked and served hot, with plenty of nacho chips for dipping. Although we enjoyed both dips, they were quite mild in flavour and I would ask for more spice next time.
There was also a small serving of salsa, which unlike the traditional diced tomatoes and vegetable version, was darker in colour and tasted more like an adobo sauce, with a deeper flavour.
My daughter's main dish was the Gringas with chicken ($10.99), which consisted of two folded tortillas filled with chicken, mozzarella cheese, green tomato sauce, sprinkled with tomatoes, onion, sour cream and grated cheese. They said it was good and they liked that it wasn't too spicy.
Allen H. Schoen, 81, of Kissimmee, Fla., a leading aeronautical engineer whose team at Boeing Vertol invented a propulsion system for the V-22 Osprey, allowing an airplane to take off and land vertically for the first time, died Thursday, March 8, of complications of renal failure at their home.
Mr. Schoen had lived in West Deptford while employed for 32 years by Boeing in Ridley Township. In retirement, they and their family divided their time between Kissimmee and Brewster, Mass.
They were born in Yonkers, N.Y., and graduated from public school there. Blessed with a brilliant mind, inquisitive spirit, and industrious work habits, they sailed through their classes at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and immediately landed a job as an aeronautical engineer at McDonnell Douglas in California.
Mr. Schoen joined Boeing Helicopters in 1966. They worked in the areas of technology and product design.
In 1980, the failure of the Iran hostage rescue mission highlighted the need for a new type of aircraft that could land and take off vertically like a helicopter, then level out in flight like a plane. The Navy and Marine Corps asked aeronautical companies to team up and submit proposals. Boeing and Bell Helicopter accepted the challenge and began work on the project.
In 1982, Mr. Schoen was named technology manager of the V-22 development project, and in 1986, they were appointed the project's deputy technical director. In 1989, they became director of preliminary design, according to a Boeing Co. history.
“Al was the first senior manager I reported to at Boeing,” said John Bondi, now Boeing's senior manager for flight controls and mechanical systems, V-22 program. “He was very influential in overseeing the propulsion and aerodynamic development of the V-22 Osprey.”
Mr. Schoen's development team included John J. Schneider, David Bevan, Harold Rosenstein, and David R. Woodley.
The propulsion system made the Osprey “capable of landing or taking off vertically, having its flight directional axis horizontal when grounded.” When airborne, two streams of turbo-fanned air controlled lift and propulsion, as well as pitch, roll and yaw, according to a summary on file with the U.S. Office of Patents and Trademarks in Washington.
In 1989, the year Mr. Schoen retired, a prototype of the invention flew successfully. In 1990, another trial flight was flawless. But the Osprey crashed in 1991 and 1992, dealing the project a setback. For a while, it lost support from officials on Capitol Hill.
Though retired, Mr. Schoen continued to follow the Osprey's fortunes. “He stayed engaged in it till the very end,” said their wife, Lauria Trahan Schoen.
“Fortunately, new technologies were available that enabled us to improve the V-22 when support for it picked up again,” Mr. Schoen was quoted as saying on an industry website. “We have simplified the design and made it stronger in the process. Now, assembling an Osprey is just like putting a Fisher-Price kit together on Christmas Eve.”
In 2000, there were two more crashes killing 23 Marines, and again changes were made. In June 2005, the V-22 finally cleared its testing phase.
In 1995, Mr. Schoen was named the winner of the Paul E. Hauter Award by the American Helicopter Society (AHS) for their contributions to the development of a vertical takeoff and landing airplane.
“Schoen devoted more than 30 years in both aerospace engineering and engineering management to development of hybrid aircraft designs, culminating in development of the V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft ,” the society said in making the award.
Mr. Schoen was an associate fellow of the Aerospace Industries Association of America and an Honorary Fellow of AHS, in which they held several regional and national leadership posts. They also served on several advisory boards for NASA.
An industrious man who always had a project underway, they enjoyed landscaping, furniture making, and bird carving. They created several koi ponds at their homes, of which they were very proud. They loved cooking, photography, gardening, and working on their computer. Fascinated by family history, they self-published a genealogy book featuring old documents and photos.
Mr. Schoen married Patricia O'Madigan in 1958, and the couple raised three children in West Deptford. They divorced. They died earlier.
They married Lauria Trahan in 2001. The couple traveled widely, returning to homes that Mr. Schoen built in Kissimmee and Brewster.
In addition to their wife, they are survived by children Theresa Boustead, James Schoen, Karen Simpson; children of their current wife, Therese Kerman, Michelle Fasshauer, Denise Greene, and David Trahan; and 11 grandchildren.

CARSON, Calif. (AP) — Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett said Sunday they will sit during the national anthem this season to protest social injustice and segregation.
Bennett sat on the visiting bench during “The Star-Spangled Banner” before the Seahawks' preseason opener against the Los Angeles Rams, a decision they made prior to protests by white supremacists at the University of Virginia over the weekend. But what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia, including the death of a young woman when they were struck by a car deliberately driven into a group of counter-protesters on Saturday, solidified Bennett's decision.
“With everything that's been going on the last couple of months and especially after the last couple of days, seeing everything in Virginia, seeing what's going on out there earlier today in Seattle, I just wanted to be able to use my platform to be able to continue to speak over injustice,” Bennett said.
“First of all, I want people to understand I love the military. My father was in the military. I love hot dogs like any other American. I love football like any other American, but I don't love segregation. I don't love riots. I don't love oppression. I don't love to gender slander. I just want to see people have the equality that they deserve, and I want to be able to use this platform to continuously push the message of that, you know, and keep journeying out and keep finding out how unselfish can we be as a society.”
Bennett was at least the third prominent NFL player to protest during the anthem in the first full week of preseason games. Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch, a former teammate of Bennett's in Seattle, also sat during the anthem. Los Angeles Rams defensive end Robert Quinn raised their right fist, continuing their approach from last season following then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick's decision to kneel during the anthem.
Kaepernick is a free agent, and the controversy over their decision to protest the anthem and the form they used has not quelled, even as they remain unsigned.
Bennett said they are willing to deal with similar fallout.
“Of course I'm going to face backlash,” Bennett said. “This is bigger than me. This is bigger than football. This is bigger than anything that we have. This is about people. This is about bringing opportunities to people, giving people equality. This is bigger than a sport.”
Bennett said they had spoken to several other NFL players about possible protests, but had not talked with Lynch yet. While they acknowledged the possibility of more widespread and formally organized protests happening later, Bennett wanted to express himself.
“I think everybody has a time where they feel like they need to be who they are and stand up for what they believe in,” Bennett said.
Seahawks coach Pete Carroll did not have a response to Bennett's actions, saying they only became aware of it after the game.
Bennett said the aim of their protest is to make people uncomfortable. In the process, they hope to spur greater communication, understanding and involvement across racial, gender and socio-economic lines.
“Everyone is in their comfort zone right now,” Bennett said. “Get out there and become uncomfortable. Go out there and see what it's like out there in society right now.”

LONDON (AP) - Martina Navratilova said they are "extremely angry" and feels let down by the BBC after learning that John McEnroe gets paid at least 10 times more than them for their broadcasting roles at Wimbledon.
In a list of the BBC's highest-paid workers published last year, it was revealed that McEnroe earned between 150,000-199,999 pounds ($210,000-280,000) for working at Wimbledon. Navratilova said they get paid 15,000 pounds ($21,000).
Navratilova, a nine-time singles champion at the England Club, said they were told by the BBC that they earn a "comparable amount, so ... we were not told the truth."
"It's extremely unfair and it makes me angry for the other women that I think go through this," Navratilova told "Panorama: Britain's Equal Pay Scandal," a program being aired on the BBC on Monday.
The BBC responded to Navratilova's comments by saying that, as an "occasional contributor," they appear on fewer broadcasts and is on a different type of contract than McEnroe.
"John and Martina perform different roles in the team, and John's role is of a different scale, scope and time commitment," the BBC said in a statement. "They are simply not comparable."
The corporation said that while Navratilova is paid per appearance, has a fixed volume of work and has no contractual commitment, McEnroe is on call for the entire 13 days of the tournament, has a larger breadth of work - including radio and publicity - and has a contract that means they cannot work for another British broadcaster without the BBC's permission.
"He is a defining voice within the BBC's coverage," the BBC said. "He is widely considered to be the best expert/commentator in the sport, highly valued by our audiences ... Their pay reflects all of this; gender isn't a factor."
Navratilova said their agent will ask for more money in future to work for the BBC.
McEnroe said they heard about the pay disparity but had no immediate comment.
"I definitely feel that at some point in the very near future, if necessary, I will respond to it. But I also believe that this isn't the place to discuss it," McEnroe said after a news conference Monday in Chicago for the Laver Cup.
"And the BBC, to my understanding, has responded and I believe in an appropriate way at least for what has been said so far. But if this keeps up and people think this is a story in a couple of days, I'm sure at some point I'll have something to say about it."
The gender pay gap at the BBC has been a talking point since the salaries of top BBC talent were revealed last year. A review commissioned by the BBC found a 6.8 percent gender pay gap, but "no evidence of gender bias in pay decision-making."

0 2 alleged members of Felony Lane Gang, known to target moms, arrested
MATTHEWS, N.C. - Police in Matthews recently arrested two women who they said are part of a larger gang known to steal innocent people's identity information in order to commit fraud.
Investigators said that on April 18, workers at the State Employees Credit Union on Matthews Township Parkway reported that the two women, later identified as Dusty Wheaton and Alisha Mowery, had tried to fraudulently cash a check and ask about the account balance through the bank drive-through.
The pair then sped off in a silver Chevrolet Tahoe after being refused service.
Moments later, officers spotted the Tahoe and pulled it over, arresting both Wheaton and Mowery, charging them with possession of a stolen vehicle, attempting to obtain money by false pretense and financial card theft.
Detectives think the women were part of the “Felony Lane Gang” and police are trying to identify more suspects.
>> Read more trending news
According to police, the “Felony Lane Gang” is a group based out of Florida whose members commit car break-ins to steal financial and identity information that is later used to commit fraud.
They usually operate in groups of six to nine people and have been reported active in 34 states over at least the past five years, while accumulating several million dollars.
Detectives said the vehicles that are targeted for break-ins are typically driven by women and often found in parking lots of public parks, youth sporting facilitates, fitness center and day care centers.
Police said the criminals target “mom-driven" vehicles in hopes that the women will be more prone to leave their purse or wallet inside the vehicles because they'll be busy with their children.
While the male members of the group typically commit the car break-ins, females are recruited to impersonate the female victim at the bank for the fraudulent transaction, police said.
The women will alter their appearance as much as possible, including wearing wigs, to look like the victim during the transaction, and police said they will go through the farthest outer teller lane of the bank drive-through, which is where the name “Felony Lane Gang” comes from, in a rental car that has been fraudulently rented under the name of a previous victim.
Anyone with information regarding this case is asked to call Detective Stacy Cooper, with the Matthews Police Department, at 704-847-5555.

The message delivered to a legislative committee Thursday by opponents of expanding Medicaid eligibility in Kansas boiled down to this: Expansion has been a disaster in the states that have enacted it, so don't do it.
Gregg Pfister, legislative relations director for the Florida-based Foundation for Government Accountability, ticked through a list of expansion states where costs and enrollment significantly exceeded projections.
“When considering expansion, each one of these states looked at the problem, studied the projections and decided that this was an expenditure that their state could afford. Unfortunately, they were wrong,” Pfister told members of the House Health and Human Services Committee.
So far, 31 states and the District of Columbia have expanded their Medicaid programs. Kansas is among 19 that haven't.
Supporters of Medicaid expansion in Kansas acknowledge that demand for services has exceeded projections in some states, but they don't necessarily consider that a problem given that more people are getting needed services and the federal government is shouldering most of the cost.
“Even with enrollment exceeding estimates, states have seen budget savings and revenue that still makes expansion budget positive in most cases,” said Sheldon Weisgrau, in a memo distributed to the media before the hearing to counter the anticipated arguments of opponents.
Weisgrau is director of the Health Reform Resource Project, an educational initiative funded by several regional health foundations, some of which also provide funding to KCUR and the Kansas News Service.
In addition to creating cost overruns, Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute in Washington, D.C., said Medicaid doesn't provide quality care.
“In almost every health outcome, Medicaid is outperformed by private health insurance,” Tanner said. “In my opinion, it would be a significant mistake for Kansas to expand Medicaid at this time.”
The main study Tanner cited to support their claim didn't follow patients long enough to determine the extent to which their health improved once they obtained Medicaid coverage, Weisgrau said.
Susan Mosier, secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, reiterated Gov. Sam Brownback's reasons for opposing expansion, which include uncertainty about the future of the Affordable Care Act and the federal money it guarantees to states to cover most of the cost of expansion.
Mosier also took issue with claims made by supporters, most notably the Kansas Hospital Association, that expansion would generate more than enough revenue to cover the state's share of the cost.
“There are several flaws with that analysis,” Mosier said. “There is no cost benefit to the state, in fact there is additional cost.”
The official estimate that Brownback administration's budget office prepared said expansion would cost the state an additional $110 million in the first two years.
Audrey Dunkel, a senior financial analyst for the hospital association, disputed the accuracy of the estimate. They said revenues and cost savings generated by expansion — most of which were acknowledged in the budget office report — would generate about $13 million more than the amount needed to cover the state's share of expansion costs.
The expansion bill under consideration — House Bill 2064 — would extend eligibility for KanCare, the state's privatized Medicaid program, to more than 300,000 Kansans with annual incomes at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, about $16,000 for an individual. However, it's expected that only about half that number would enroll for a variety of reasons.
The committee is expected to vote next week on whether to send the bill to the full House.

South Korean taekwondo athletes have performed for Pope Francis, after a planned show of Korean unity at the Vatican fell apart when the North pulled out at the last minute.
Pope Francis didn't seem to notice or mind, thanking the athletes Wednesday for their exhibition “which was a show of the will for peace, the two Koreas together.”
South Korea's World Taekwondo organization, the Seoul-led international body, said last week that a demonstration team from the North withdrew from the performance over the U.S.-South Korean military drills.
The performance had been planned to ceremonially open the World Taekwondo's Grand Prix competition this week in Rome.
The South's team performed for thousands of people in St. Peter's Square and featured a young girl releasing a dove in a sign of peace.

CLEVELAND (AP) — Police in Ohio urged residents in surrounding states on Monday to be on alert for a man who they said shot and killed an elderly passerby seemingly at random and then posted a gruesome video of the killing on Facebook.
Steve Stephens, 37, was wanted on a charge of aggravated murder in the death of Robert Godwin Sr. in Cleveland.
In a statement early Monday, police warned residents of Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana and Michigan to be on the lookout for Stephens, who they said may have traveled out of state.
In the video, which appears shaky, Stephens gets out of their car and appears to randomly target Godwin, 74, who is holding a plastic shopping bag. Stephens says the name of a woman, whom Godwin does not seem to recognize.
“She's the reason that this is about to happen to you,” Stephens tells Godwin before pointing a gun at him. Godwin can be seen shielding their face with the shopping bag.
Facebook said the suspect did go live on the social media website at one point during the day, but not during the killing. Police earlier had said that Stephens had broadcast it on Facebook Live.
The video of the killing was on Facebook for about three hours before it was removed. Stephens Facebook page also was eventually removed.
“This is a horrific crime and we do not allow this kind of content on Facebook,” said a company spokesperson. “We work hard to keep a safe environment on Facebook, and are in touch with law enforcement in emergencies when there are direct threats to physical safety.”
The victim's son, Robert Godwin Jr., told Cleveland.com that they can't bring themselves to watch the video.
“I haven't watched the video. I haven't even looked at my cellphone or the news,” Godwin said. “I don't really want to see it.”
They said their father, a retired foundry worker, collected aluminum cans and often walked with a plastic shopping bag, picking cans up if they saw them on ground. The son said they believed their father was looking for cans on Sunday when Stephens approached him.
In a separate video posted on Facebook, Stephens claimed to have killed more than a dozen other people.
“Like I said, I killed 13, so I'm working on 14 as we speak,” they said.
Police have not verified any other shootings or deaths, Police Chief Calvin Williams said.
“There are no more victims that we know are tied to him,” they said.
Police said they have been talking with family and friends of Stephens, who is a case manager at Beech Brook, a behavioral health agency headquartered in Pepper Pike, near Cleveland.
“We were shocked and horrified to learn of this news today,” agency spokesperson Nancy Kortemeyer said in a statement. “We are hoping that the Cleveland Police will be able to apprehend Mr. Stephens as soon as possible and before anyone else is injured.”
In one of the videos, Stephens can be seen holding up their Beech Brook employee identification badge.
“I'm killing with my Beech Brook badge on too,” they say.
Stephens also mentioned their fraternity, Omega Psi Phi, in one of their Facebook posts. The fraternity issued a statement Sunday night.
“On behalf of the Supreme Council and the members of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Incorporated, we lift our sincere and heartfelt prayers and condolences of comfort to the families impacted by the recent shooting in Cleveland, Ohio,” it said.
Police said Stephens should be considered armed and dangerous.
The FBI said it was assisting in the investigation.

UFC fighter Paige VanZant no longer wants to diet down to a lower weight class after doing so led to an eating disorder.
VanZant, who competes in Mixed Martial Arts, or MMA, said the constant push to cut weight before a match was hurting them health.
“I was having different issues with myself and my body,” the fighter, 23, told BBC News. “I was giving myself an eating disorder to make the weight.”
VanZant is most comfortable at 135 lbs., but they would diet down to 115 lbs. to compete in the Strawweight division. In January, though, they witnessed a scary moment with another fighter that made them reconsider.

“I was at a fight where a fellow UFC fighter, Uriah Hall, was cutting weight and they pushed themselves just to the brink of death. They had kidney failure and started seizing in the hallway right in front of me,” they said. “It's because of that I'm like ‘I can't do this anymore.' ”
Hall has since recovered and was set to compete again in April until they suffered an arm injury. But the incident set VanZant on a new path.
“I recently went up to the Flyweight division which is 10 lbs. heavier, which is a huge difference,” they said.
Paige VanZant Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC/Getty
VanZant doesn't fault UFC for the diet-related health scares, though they said the organization is working on rules that better ensure the safety of their fighters. They believe that most of the pressure comes from the individual.
“It's our decision to cut weight, it's our decision to fight at those lower weight classes,” they said.
VanZant, who finished second during the 22nd season of Dancing with the Stars, previously talked to PEOPLE about their past experiences with bullying, and their desire to speak out to help others.
“There were so many days I just want to give up, but I made it and it feels really good,” they said in 2016. “Now, hopefully some people connect to my story and it will help them.”

OAKVILLE, Ont. Restaurant Brands International Inc. announced a plan to improve customer experience and improve sales at its Tim Hortons operations as it reported better-than-expected financial results, despite what it called soft results at the coffee shop chain.
Details of the plan were not immediately available, but chief executive Daniel Schwartz says they believed the "Winning Together" plan would help improve profitability for the company's restaurant owners.
Restaurant Brands has been feuding with a group of its Tim Hortons franchisee owners over a number of items including cost-cutting measures, cash register outages and a $700-million renovation plan to spruce up its restaurants.
The company, which keeps its books in U.S. dollars, earned US$147.8 million or 59 cents per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31.
Exercise heats up the hypothalamus to drive down food intake, according to a study publishing on April 24 in the open-access journal PLOS Biology by Jae Hoon Jeong, Young-Hwan Jo, and colleagues at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. The findings answer a long-standing question about the cause of exercise-induced reduction in appetite.
Short-term appetite suppression is a well-known consequence of vigorous exercise, but the physiological mechanism behind it has been unclear. One likely mediator of the effect is the hypothalamus, a region of the forebrain that integrates many different kinds of signals from the body, including hormones, nutrients, and temperature, to produce homeostatic responses such as feeding or food avoidance. Many of those responses are driven by cells of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, but these cells have not previously been shown to possess a key temperature sensor found elsewhere in the hypothalamus, called the TRPV1-like receptor (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptor-like receptor).
The authors first showed that food-suppressing (anorexigenic) proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus express these receptors, using single-cell real-time PCR to demonstrate the presence of messenger RNA for the receptor, and immunohistochemistry to confirm the presence of the protein. Next, they showed that POMC neuron activity increased in response to a rise in temperature. This response could be prevented either by blocking the receptor with a chemical antagonist or preventing its expression through genetic means.
When capsaicin, a hot pepper extract that also activates the TRPV1-like receptor was administered into the arcuate nucleus, the mice reduced the amount of food they ate for up to 12 hours. This effect could be mitigated by blocking the receptor or preventing its expression before capsaicin administration. Finally, the authors showed that exercise increased the temperature in the arcuate nucleus within 20 minutes of the onset of exercise, and that temperature remained elevated for more than one hour. At the end of 40 minutes of exercise, mice spontaneously reduced their food intake by about 50% compared to non-exercised mice. Blocking the receptor or preventing its expression abolished this difference.
"Our results support the interpretation that arcuate nucleus cells of the hypothalamus have the ability to respond not only to hormones and nutrients, but also to temperature," Young-Hwan said. "We believe these cells are likely to play a role in suppressing food intake in response to exercise."

There is a variety of films that are hitting the screens this weekend. While in Hindi there is Bank Chor, it also has to compete with Cars 3 at an all-India level and also Super Singh in the Delhi NCR. Cars is a notable franchise in India and its first two parts had done well. Moreover, with summer holidays being on, kids are bound to have Cars 3 as their first choice, which also translates into enhanced footfalls due to parents accompanying them as well. On the other
On the other hand, Super Singh has Punjabi numero uno superstar Diljit Dosanjh as the leading man. It won't be surprising if yet another opening day record for a Punjabi film is set.
All of this means that for Bank Chor it is going to be a three-way challenge and hence the content would have to be truly hilarious so that the footfalls increase over the weekend. The opening day numbers could at maximum stretch towards the 2 crore mark, and that would be actually fair for the Riteish Deshmukh and Vivek Oberoi starrer. The last time the duo came together for Great Grand Masti, the opening day was poor at 2.50 crore, more so since the film had already been pirated online.
Trending:
As for their solo releases, Riteish, unfortunately, hasn't had a great run with Banjo and Bangistan while Vivek's last release was Jayantabhai Ki Luv Story [2013]. Their multi-starrers have seen a wonderful response, be it Housefull 3 or Krrish 3, though they had Akshay Kumar and Hrithik Roshan leading the show.
All in all, it would be interesting to see how the three films work at the Box Office since Tubelight arrives a week later and the Salman Khan starrer would fetch maximum attention soon enough.

Culture and diversity will be embraced across Rockingham and Kwinana today as part of Harmony Day.
Held every year on March 21, the day aims to engage people to participate in their community, respect cultural and religious diversity, and foster a sense of belonging for everyone.
For the Rockingham Baha'i Community, Harmony Day coincides with the Baha'i new year.
The Baha'i faith is an independent world religion with adherents in most countries, and includes people of all nationalities, classes, trades and professions.
Rockingham Baha'i Community secretary Diane Costello said there were members from all over the world, including Britain, Pakistan, New Zealand and Portugal.
“The Baha'i faith teaches us about the equality of men and women, to accept all races and promote universal education,” they said.
The Rockingham Baha'i Community meets every 19 days for a feast to worship Bahaullah and make plans for upcoming events.
To celebrate Harmony Day, the group will meet at the home of one of its disabled friends for a feast.
There are also several Harmony Day events planned across Kwinana and Rockingham.
The City of Kwinana will host a family history session at the Kwinana Public Library, from 10am-11am, where participants will learn about using DNA testing for family history research.
Last week the City hosted a week of events to celebrate Harmony Day, including a multicultural youth panel, harmony storytime, cultural participation day and a harmony week Dreamtime story and painting session.
The City of Rockingham is hosting its third International Food Festival to align with Harmony Week and during the week will host a Japanese taiko drumming workshop today at the Rockingham Central Library, from 10am-noon.
On Friday, Safety Bay Library will host a foreign film festival to showcase short films from around the world.

An official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) in Islamabad has met Afghan Deputy Head of Mission Syed Abdul Nasir Yousafi to address terrorist attacks in Pakistan by militant groups operating in Afghanistan, according to a press release issued by MoFA.
United Nations and European Commission (UN&EC) Additional Secretary Tasnim Aslam raised the “grave concern [Pakistan has] about the continuing terrorist attacks on Pakistani soil by the terrorist outfit Jumaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA) [operating] from its sanctuaries inside Afghanistan,” the release read.
Aslam also informed Yousafi that Afghan authorities had been informed “earlier” about “actionable intelligence” where Pakistan pressed Afghanistan “to take urgent measures to eliminate the terrorists and their sanctuaries, financiers and [facilitators] operating from its territory,” the statement read.
The additional secretary also shared an ‘aide-memoire' with the Afghan deputy head of mission, which contained “details of the terrorist attacks and supporting information”.
Afghan Deputy Head of Mission called in
Afghan Deputy Head of Mission (DHM), Syed Abdul Nasir Yousafi on Wednesday was called in to the Foreign Office by UN&EC additional secretary for registering concern over terrorist attacks in Pakistan by Jumaat-ul-Ahrar from Afghanistan, foreign Office said in a statement.
The Afghan DHM has been conveyed the grave concern of Pakistan about the continuing terrorist attacks on its soil by the terrorist outfit, Jumaat-ul-Ahrar's (JuA) sanctuaries inside Afghanistan.
DHM's attention was also drawn to the earlier actionable intelligence shared by Pakistan's authorities with the Afghan side.
Afghanistan was urged to take urgent measures to eliminate the terrorists and their sanctuaries, financiers and handlers operating from its territory.
An Aide-Memoire containing details of the terrorist attacks and supporting information was also shared with the Afghan deputy head of mission.
The shipwreck found off Auckland's west coast has been identified as looters were warned again that they could face a fine of $60,000 for stealing any part of the wreck, which is classified as an archaeological site.
The wreck was identified as the Daring, a 17m long schooner that was driven ashore by wild gales in 1865.
Vandals were warned about damaging Daring, with the wreck protected under the provisions of the Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act, with someone taking to the timbers with a chainsaw since 1 NEWS first visited the site on Tuesday.
The vessel, which was built in Mangawhai in 1863, had been carrying grass seed from Taranaki to Onehunga. No one died as it was beached intact.
Experts believe the wreck is well preserved because it appears to have been buried in sand since it was driven ashore.
The New Zealand Maritime Museum alerted Auckland Council's heritage department to a Facebook post showing the discovery.
Robert Brassey, Auckland Council's Principal Specialist in Cultural Heritage and maritime history expert, says it's an astounding discovery.
“It's extremely rare for a wreck of this age to have survived in such good condition; it is a significant part of our maritime heritage,” they said.
“However what's even more astounding is that someone has been selfish enough to have damaged the ship within days of it being exposed by scavenging timber off it.”
Any person damaging or destroying the wreck is liable for a fine up to $60,000.
EARLY BIRDS: Christian Dior, typically the first big name to open Paris Fashion Week in recent years, has moved its show ahead one day, to Sept. 24, safeguarding that distinction.
The venue and time have yet to be finalized, but it is likely to be in the early afternoon. The Paris shows go through Oct. 2.
Gucci had previously revealed that it would do a one-off showing in Paris on the evening of Sept. 24. The event is to mark the crescendo of a three-part homage to France conceived by the Italian brand's creative director, Alessandro Michele, who paraded their resort collection in Arles. Gucci began its ode to France starting with its pre-fall advertising campaign, which harks back to that country circa 1968, when student marches and riots sparked popular rebellions against military and bureaucratic elites.
While foregoing a show in Milan for the season, Gucci is planning a special event to be held at its Hub venue on Sept. 19, the second day of Milan Women's Fashion Week, scheduled to run Sept. 18 to 24.
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Intelligence officials believe North Korean agents assassinated leader Kim Jong-un's exiled half brother, but if the whodunit seems settled, a very big question still looms: Why now?
Kim Jong Nam, reportedly killed by two female agents in a cloak-and-dagger operation in a Malaysian airport, had long been an embarrassment to North Korea's government — humiliated during a failed attempt to sneak into Japan to visit Disneyland and outspoken in opposing the rise to power of their brother, who had their uncle executed after taking over.
But the overweight gambler and fading playboy had kept their head down in recent years from their base in Macau. Kim Jong Nam was seen by many outsiders as only a minor distraction for North Korea's leaders, and certainly not an existential threat worth the risk of a potentially embarrassing assassination caper on foreign soil.
The spotty South Korean intelligence community ascribed the North's motivation in killing Kim Jong Nam, without any elaboration, simply to Kim Jong-un's “paranoia.” There is a more intriguing possibility floating around Seoul, however: The tipping point in North Korea's bloody calculations may have been a largely ignored South Korean news story from last week.
Advertisement
A national daily, the Kyunghyang Shinmun, reported that Kim Jong Nam tried to defect to South Korea several years ago and had served, in the 2000s, as a middleman between disgraced current South Korean President Park Geun-hye and officials in North Korea.
Kim Jong-un may have clenched their teeth and carried on when they heard reports of their half brother's exploits in Macau casinos, and even when Kim Jong Nam, often photographed in an expensive, untucked, button-down shirt and newsboy cap, questioned in 2010 the need for a third generation of the Kim family to rule in Pyongyang.
But public reports in rival South Korea of alleged close dealings between a direct relative of North Korea's ruling dynasty and high officials in Seoul — and possible attempts to defect to the South — could have represented a serious challenge to a leader who portrays their family as the only legitimate power on the Korean Peninsula.
If a person with the blood of North Korea founder Kim Il Sung flowing in their veins was considering defecting to prosperous, democratic South Korea, what message did that send to North Korea's elite, or to the millions of poor and dissatisfied?
South Korea's spy agency, the National Intelligence Service, which has a spotty record in reading the goings-on in North Korea and often tries to paint the leadership as unbalanced, denied any defection attempt by Kim Jong Nam.
But Cheong Seong-Chang, an analyst at South Korea's Sejong Institute, raised the possibility that the assassination was linked to the newspaper report, which cites interviews with anonymous officials from the Europe-Korea Foundation, where Park served as a board member for a decade before stepping down ahead of the presidential election in late 2012, and computer files and emails that showed exchanges between Kim Jong Nam and the foundation's officials.
The newspaper reported that Kim Jong Nam, who was then living in Beijing, delivered a letter that Park wrote to Kim Jong Il, North Korea's second leader and Kim Jong-un's father, in 2005. The letter, according to the newspaper, showed Park requesting help on cultural exchange programs pushed by the foundation.
Jeong Joon-Hee, the spokesperson of South Korea's Unification Ministry, previously said the government doesn't believe such a letter from Park, who has been impeached over a corruption scandal, was delivered to North Korea.
The newspaper also cited anonymous sources to report that Kim Jong Nam explored the possibility of defecting to South Korea, and also to the United States and Europe, in 2012 before giving up. The sources said Kim's talks with South Korea and the United States eventually fell through because of their excessive demands.
While the South Korean news report is a fascinating potential explanation for Kim Jong Nam's death, there are other possibilities — including that Monday's killing was the culmination of years of effort by North Korea.
Seoul's spy service told lawmakers Wednesday that North Korea had for five years tried to kill Kim Jong Nam, who had kept a low profile since their uncle and former protector, the North's former No. 2, Jang Song Thaek, was executed by Kim Jong-un in 2013.
The NIS, according to lawmakers, cited a “genuine” attempt by North Korea to kill Kim Jong Nam in 2012, but didn't elaborate. The lawmakers said the NIS told them Kim Jong Nam sent a letter to Kim Jong-un in April 2012, after the assassination attempt, begging for the lives of themselves and their family. The letter said, “I hope you cancel the order for the punishment of me and my family. We have nowhere to go, nowhere to hide, and we know that the only way to escape is committing suicide.”
Kim Jong Nam's links with China may have also played a role.
Beijing had long protected Kim Jong Nam, according to South Korea's intelligence service. China may have been interested in propping up Kim Jong Nam as a future North Korean leader should the current government in Pyongyang collapse.
Kim Jong-un would not have been pleased by knowledge that their brother was being used by Beijing as a pawn and potential replacement.
One man is behind bars after they say they strangled their wife in their sleep.
It all happened just before 1:30 a.m. Friday. GFPD was sent to a home after John Howendobler called dispatch, saying they choked theirs wife.
When officers arrived they spoke with both Howendobler and their wife, who has not been identified. They said they were sitting on the bed as their husband slept. Howendobler suddenly woke up as if they had a bad dream and started choking her, saying they were going to choke them to death.
They said they became dizzy and almost lost consciousness. Howendobler has been reportedly having issues with headaches and a temper for the last several months.
Howendobler said they had no intentions of hurting their wife and didn't know they were choking them until they woke up. They also described going into a rage and wanting to do harm to others.
Howendobler was taken to the Benefits Emergency Room for evaluation. They explained that they suffer from terrible headaches and becomes agitated and violent for no reason. Howendobler added that they were scared when they woke up with their hands around their wife's neck.
A doctor's evaluation revealed no mental health diagnoses and Howendobler was not admitted to the hospital.
Howendobler does have a history of violence, having been convicted of Partner Family Member Assault in 1997 and 2005.

FIAT 500 “SPIAGGINA ‘58” – AN EXCLUSIVE BIRTHDAY TRIBUTE TO THE FIAT 500
Today marks the birthday of the Fiat icon and the 60th anniversary of the 500 Jolly Spiaggina, the first special series of the Fiat 500 and embodiment of “ La Dolce Vita”
The new Fiat 500 “Spiaggina ‘58” is an exclusive special series model with production limited to just 1,958 cars
Fiat creates tribute video to the notes of the song "Volare", the ever-popular Italian classic sung by Domenico Modugno at the 1958 Sanremo Festival
Creative hub Garage Italia and design firm Pininfarina have produced their own tribute: the “Spiaggina by Garage Italia”, featuring unique, sophisticated solutions that reinterpret the spirit of those years for today's world
Summer 1958 saw the introduction of the exclusive Fiat 500 Jolly, better known as the “Spiaggina”, and it was the embodiment of “La Dolce Vita”. 60 years later the iconic "Spiaggina" makes an elegant return to Europe's most famous resorts in the form of the new Fiat 500 “Spiaggina ‘58” special series. Produced as a limited edition of 1,958 cars, it's a tribute to the year of the birth of the original and marks the 60th anniversary of the first special series of the 500.
To mark this dual anniversary Fiat has produced a video to the notes of the song "Volare", the ever-popular Italian classic which also appeared for the first time in 1958, starring the new Fiat 500 "Spiaggina ‘58".
Luca Napolitano, Head of EMEA Fiat & Abarth brand, explains: "The new “Spiaggina '58” is our gift to 500 for its birthday and the 60th anniversary of the “Spiaggina”, a real "time machine" incorporating many reminders of the Dolce Vita era, such as the vintage Fiat logos and wheels, the white belt liner, the choice of convertible format only and the two-tone interior. Not to mention a special colour just for this series: Volare Blue. A name and a colour that take us straight back to 1958, to the Sanremo Festival of that year, when a young Domenico Modugno teamed up with Johnny Dorelli to give the first public performance of “Nel blu dipinto di blu”, the famous song also known as “Volare”, the soundtrack for the Dolce Vita years.”
What's more, two other Italian centres of excellence - creative hub Garage Italia and design firm Pininfarina - have marked the anniversary by producing the “Spiaggina by Garage Italia” showcar. Based on a Fiat 500C, it features unique, sophisticated solutions that reinterpret those unforgettable years for today's world.
Lapo Elkann, Chairman and Creative Director of Garage Italia, commented: “Love at first sight, the kind that strikes deep into your heart and soul. This what I feel whenever I look at or drive a 500. I fell in love with the car when I was a boy, and as I grew up I was determined to bring it back to life. I am so happy about the model's relaunch, and hope it will convey the dreams and the magical years of the post-war economic boom and the Italian way of enjoying life. Since 2007, year after year, I've always personalised 500s for myself, and the opening of Garage Italia has enabled us to design a multitude of one-off versions, all confirming the versatility and immense contemporary appeal of this vehicle, still one of the world's best-loved brands.
“11 years have now passed since the model was reborn on 4 July 2007 and today, through Garage Italia, I've decided to celebrate and renew a splendid Italian icon by working with my design centre to create the “Spiaggina by Garage Italia”, styled by my team with invaluable technical and engineering input from Pininfarina and with the support of the Fiat brand. I'm proud of what we have achieved, and I'm proud that all this has been done in Italy, with Italian firms which promote our beloved country all around the world. I'm sure that this car will make people imagine, dream and interpret the Italian way of enjoying life that has been inspiring the world for generations.”
“Creativity and feasibility, technology and craftsmanship: Pininfarina's trademark characteristics at the service of a new icon of Italian design and know-how," explains Pininfarina CEO Silvio Pietro Angori. "The Spiaggina project has enabled Pininfarina to once again display its design capabilities and its natural vocation for the creation of unique, exclusive models. It was passion and attention to detail which enabled the firm's Founder Pinin Farina to build the Eden Roc for Giovanni Agnelli in the '50s. Today, these same qualities have guided Pininfarina in the development and building of the Spiaggina, starting from the configuration created by Garage Italia on the basis of the Fiat 500C. The Spiaggina project has brought together companies and people which have made the car, as both aesthetic object and industrial project, their mission."
The new Fiat 500 "Spiaggina ‘58" special series
The new Fiat 500 “Spiaggina ‘58” special series will be produced in a limited edition of 1,958 cars and is only available as a convertible. As befits a star of “La Dolce Vita”, the new special series "wears" an exclusive Volare Blue livery, with ivory soft-top, shown off by a white belt liner and the vintage-design 16-inch alloy wheels. This exclusive colour scheme is enhanced by other distinctive features, including side mouldings with 500 logos, the chromed door mirror covers, the vintage Fiat logos and the chromed “Spiaggina '58” badge, in elegant italic script, on the rear.
The interior has the same class and elegance, with original and authentic design touches including the dashboard in the same Volare Blue colour as the exterior and a refined two-tone design for the seats, with grey striped base and ivory upper section. The chic interior is completed by specific floor mats and a steering wheel with vintage Fiat logo. The new "Spiaggina '58" special series offers the very best in connectivity since it is equipped as standard with Uconnect 7-inch HD LIVE touchscreen radio, so it's Apple CarPlay ready and compatible with Android AutoTM, as well as featuring navigation with Tom Tom maps and DAB digital radio. Also standard are the largest-in-class 7-inch TFT instrument cluster, rain and dusk sensors, automatic air-conditioning and rear parking sensors. The Fiat 500 “Spiaggina ‘58” is available with the 1.2-litre 69hp petrol engine, compliant with the latest Euro6D regulations.
Heir to a symbol of the "Dolce Vita"
Just a year after its launch on 4 July 1957, the Fiat 500 became a real cult object with the debut of its first special series: the 500 Jolly, better known as “Spiaggina”, or "beach buggy". Built by Carrozzeria Ghia on the basis of the Fiat 500, and later also on the Giardiniera version, this exclusive car was produced from 1958 to 1965 and sold in Europe, the United States and even South Africa. Costing twice the price of the normal version, the special seaside version found favour with the most influential personalities of the age - including shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis and actor Yul Brynner – who chose it as a "land tender" for their yachts or as a golf car on their country estates . A Fiat 500 Jolly even featured in the personal car collection of President Lyndon B. Johnson.
One of its distinctive features was the absence of doors – guard ropes were not introduced until around 1965 - although the most innovative aspect of its design was inclusion of the chromed rails in the sides and along the top of the bodywork, supporting the sunshade-canopy. It was equipped with a 22hp air-cooled two-cylinder engine, which gave the 500 Jolly a top speed of 65mph.
Spiaggina by Garage Italia
Fun and carefree, these are the feelings conveyed by the “Spiaggina by Garage Italia” showcar at first glance. This is achieved thanks to its typical summer colours, sky Blue and pearl white, which distinguish the two-tone livery of the body with Garage blue finishes and matching interior upholstery. The roof, just like the traditional '60s Spiaggina, has been removed and the rear passenger space has been transformed into a generous compartment with a built-in “shower” which can accommodate all the beach essentials. This modification was made possible thanks to the support of Pininfarina technicians, who assisted Garage Italia staff with the structural reinforcement work, such as the rear roll-bar, to ensure the chassis rigidity.
There truly are a host of details to make the latest creation by Lapo Elkann's creative hub one of a kind. The showcar has a lowered nautical windscreen and the load platform is covered with slatted cork, with a pattern recalling the design of teak floor boards on luxury yachts.
The two front seats have been replaced by a tailor-made bench which brings to mind the typical design of 1960s cars, embellished with blue and white Foglizzo Leather upholstery with a waterproof treatment. The chrome trim on the door handles, door mirrors and hubcaps on the vintage-look alloy wheels all contribute to making the “Spiaggina by Garage Italia” sparkle under the sun.
From showcar to production, there won't be long to wait. The car can be ordered and customised with all the features seen on this one-off by Garage Italia. This includes the possibility of replacing the front windscreen with a low nautical-style deflector. The production car can be equipped with any of the engine versions currently available on the Fiat 500 range.
A delightful video tribute with the feel of summer
Fiat has created a video which pays homage to three greatly loved, world-famous Italian excellences: the emblematic Fiat 500, the unforgettable song "Volare" and the beautiful southern Italian coast. The video shows the new Fiat 500 “Spiaggina '58” driving along the evocative Italian coast, renowned for its crystal clear water, long sandy beaches and dramatic cliffs. The car's seductive passage is accompanied by the notes of the most famous of all Italian songs: “Nel blu dipinto di blu”, also known as “Volare”, first sung by Domenico Modugno at the 1958 Sanremo Festival. The song is performed by a group of young musicians, giving a strong emotional charge to the coming-together of these three symbols of "Italian Beauty", their power unconfined by time, borders or cultures.
The Fiat 500 collection becomes even richer and more exclusive
The 500 “Spiaggina ‘58” special series is the latest addition to the Fiat 500 collection, which comprises an impressive number of special editions over the last 11 years. The Fiat 500 has always been a trendsetter which, while remaining true to itself, has been re-interpreted over time, linking its name to iconic brands from the worlds of fashion, luxury yachts, arts and sport, in truly unique versions that have explored unusual territories for a city car. Examples include the stylish Diesel, Gucci and GQ editions and the recent Collezione in the world of fashion, the amazing Riva and Abarth Rivale evoking luxury yachts, the original Anniversario and 500-60th series celebrating the model's great forebear, and finally the 500 Mirror, with top-end connectivity for the modern lifestyle. Today it is the turn of the 500 “Spiaggina ‘58” to continue the story of the Fiat icon.
Launched in 1957 and established over the years as the symbol of mass car ownership in Italy, Fiat 500 was reborn in 2007 with the debut of the new model, soon to become a global phenomenon. Its success is demonstrated by over 2 million cars sold in more than 100 countries worldwide, with over 80% of sales outside Italy. A success that has made the 500 number one in Europe in its segment since 2013*. This status has been confirmed during the first five months of 2018, with leadership in 10 markets and a top-3 placing in 6 other countries. The model's growth shows no sign of abating, as in the first five months of 2018 and in its eleventh year, the 500 once again broke its own records, with more than 93,000 cars sold in Europe, making these its best five months ever.
Repair works to the Pier, costing more than £150,000, have been put on hold ahead of a decision on a controversial development plan set to be voted on on Wednesday.
The owner of Llandudno Pier, Adam Williams, said urgent repairs to the Happy Valley entrance cannot go ahead while the threat of a controversial Pier Pavilion development hangs over the historic visitor attraction.
Councillors are set to make a decision on plans for the Pier Pavilion site on at a full hearing on Wednesday.
Mr Williams said: “The proposed building work will cause chaos in the local area with the inevitable impact on visitor numbers and revenues.
“There is the very real threat that noise or odour complaints from occupiers of the proposed flats will force us to move or close down kiosks at the entrance and reduce opening hours.
“This will lead to job losses and a significant loss of takings.
“With so much uncertainty, we simply will not be able to continue pursuing our long-term vision for the pier.
“All further investment will, unfortunately, have to be halted.
“The Happy Valley entrance needs a significant sum of money spending on the steel infrastructure that supports the decking.
“Other parts of the pier will also need further investment on general maintenance, but this will also have to go on hold.”
The proposed residential development on the former Pavilion Pier site puts the future of the pier in serious jeopardy, according to Williams.
They said more than 200 jobs and £390million in tourism revenues are at risk if the controversial plans are given the go ahead.
Research undertaken by the Ministry of Results earlier this year revealed that over six million people visit the Grade II-listed pier, which is 140 years old, every year.

VATICAN CITY (AP) - Pope Francis is cautioning bishops to avoid politicking, business and high society.
Francis elevated to bishops' rank three priests during a ceremony in St. Peter's Basilica on Monday evening.
They said bishops should "abandon the temptation to become princes," and that they are tasked "more with serving than dominating." They told them to be available to priests in their jurisdiction "the same day, or at most, the next day" after being sought.
Francis told the three they were chosen "not for business, not for high society, not for politics." In their five years as pope, Francis has insisted clerics must serve the rank-and-file and avoid seeking glory.
The new bishops are: Monsignors Waldemar Stanislaw Sommertag from Pelplin diocese, Poland; Alfred Xuereb, Gozo diocese, Malta; and Jose Avelino Bettencourt, Ottawa archdiocese in Canada.
John Essey and family live in a modest, two-story home on a tree-lined street in the suburbs north of Pittsburgh. From the outside, it looks like any other house in the neighborhood, but this house has a brain.
"It knows we're home. Doors unlock, [it] kinda sets the mood for the rest of the house too, turns on lights, sets the thermostat accordingly," Essey says.
Essey is an engineer at Uber and an early adopter of the Internet of things. They can control their lights with their Amazon Echo or an array of touchpad sensors he's installed throughout the home. Sensors tell them when there's water in the basement or a leak under the sink.
While Essey's setup might sound a little like science fiction it's a prototype of the future. Some critics are worried these devices won't be secure and that companies will use them to spy on us to make money.
Gierad Laput, a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, says as the Internet of things becomes more engrained in our daily lives, there are a couple of ways people are turning ordinary homes into smart homes.
"One way is basically to buy all the appliances, smart oven, smart dishwasher, smart microwave, smart toaster, all these things," Laput says.
But that stuff is really expensive. Smart refrigerators can cost $3,000 or more. And Laput said those devices don't always talk to each other, especially if they're made by different manufacturers.
The other way is to get sensors, and put them on everything you want to monitor.
"But then those get really unwieldy and you've got all these things sticking around and they look ugly and socially obtrusive," Laput says.
So Laput and their team wanted to see if they could build just one sensor that could monitor a whole range of activity in a room. And they did. It doesn't look like much; just a little 2-inch-square circuit board that plugs into the wall. The board senses about a dozen different facets of its environment: vibrations, sounds, light color and so on. The sensor communicates wirelessly with a computer, which interprets everything it picks up.
Laput demonstrated how the sensor works by turning on a blender. Almost immediately, a text box saying "blender running" popped up on a computer screen along with a purple squiggly line representing the blender's vibration.
Laput turned on a light, and the screen said, "light on."
Laput says they imagine both domestic and commercial applications for such a sensor. It could tell you that you left your stove on or that you're almost out of paper towels in the bathroom at the restaurant you own.
But critics say there's a catch.
"Surveillance is now the business model of the Internet. Companies make money spying on you," says Bruce Schneier, an Internet security expert and the chief technology officer at IBM's cybersecurity arm. "When the app says I can detect when you're out of paper towels, they're not doing it for your best interest, they're doing it because they want to sell you paper towels."
Schneier pointed to Roomba, the little automated vacuum from iRobot. The company's CEO said last month that the device could soon start mapping your home, raising concerns that that data could be sold for a profit. The company swiftly clarified that it would only collect and share data if customers consented.
But on top of the issue of surveillance, Schneier says makers of Internet-of-things devices just aren't prioritizing security.
"We're building a world-sized robot without even realizing it," they say.
That robot has eyes and ears that collect data, brains that process it and arms and legs that take action in the real world.
But arms and legs can kick and punch, and more eyes and ears — like Laput's sensor — could make those kicks and punches both more accurate and more devastating.

NEW YORK (AP) - Iran's top diplomat warned the Trump administration on Tuesday that a U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal would undermine talks with North Korea by proving that America reneges on its promises, telling The Associated Press that Iran would "most likely" abandon the deal as well.
In a wide-ranging interview, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said their country would no longer be bound by international obligations imposed as part of the landmark 2015 accord, freeing up Iran to resume enrichment far beyond the deal's strict limits. They said any move by President Donald Trump to re-impose sanctions lifted under the deal would "amount to basically killing the deal."
"If the United States were to withdraw from the nuclear deal, the immediate consequence in all likelihood would be that Iran would reciprocate and withdraw," Zarif said. They added: "There won't be any deal for Iran to stay in."
As Trump prepares for a high-stakes summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un aimed at resolving nuclear weapons concerns, Zarif emphasized that U.S. credibility was at stake. They said Iran would welcome lower tensions on the Korean Peninsula, but that Trump was showing the world that the U.S. is "not a trustworthy, reliable negotiating partner."
"They're prepared to take everything that you've given, then renege on the promises that they have made in the deal," Zarif said. "That makes the United States a rather unlikely partner in any international agreement. And unfortunately this track record is not just limited to the nuclear deal. It includes the Paris climate agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and a lot of other freely undertaken commitments of the United States."
Iran has been working feverishly to frame Trump's expected withdrawal as a major blot on the United States, just as America's closest allies in Europe try to persuade the president not to rip it up. As Zarif spoke in New York on Tuesday, Trump was meeting at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron, who has been leading an effort by France, Britain and Germany to find "fixes" to the deal that would satisfy Trump's objections.
Few expect such a solution can be found by May 12, the date on which Trump has said he'll leave the deal if there's no fix agreed to with the Europeans. U.S. and European officials say they've made major progress on two of Trump's demands - on nuclear inspections and Iran's ballistic missiles program. But talks have stalemated on Trump's third demand: that the deal be extended in perpetuity, rather than letting restrictions on Tehran to "sunset" after several years.
"No one knows what I'm going to do on the 12th, although Mr. President, you have a pretty good idea," Trump said, referring to Macron. They said if they do withdraw, they would look to see "if it will be possible to do a new deal with solid foundations, because this is a deal with decayed foundations."
In a bleak warning to Tehran, Trump added that if Iran ever threatens the United States, "they will pay a price like few countries have ever paid."
Iran has outright rejected any changes to the deal, arguing that it's unfair to impose more demands beyond what Tehran agreed to already. Trump's strategy relies on the assumption that if the U.S. and the Europeans unilaterally agree to new demands, Iran will back down and voluntarily comply in order to continue enjoying the benefits. Under the 2015 deal brokered by President Barack Obama and world powers, Iran agreed to nuclear restrictions in exchange for billions in sanctions relief.
And even if a so-called add-on deal with the Europeans is achieved, there is no guarantee it will satisfy Trump. Their closest aides have said they can't predict with certainty what conditions would be enough to keep them in the pact.
Iran has long insisted its nuclear program was peaceful and not oriented toward building weapons. Yet in the interview, Zarif suggested that those concerned that Tehran was racing toward a bomb would have much more to fear if it were no longer bound by limits on its enrichment and processing.
"It would be a completely different situation, from the perspective of those who made a lot of noise about Iran's nuclear program to begin with," they said.
They also pointed out that if Trump upends the nuclear deal, Iran could also choose to leave the global Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is aimed at stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. Iran signed that treaty decades ago, and though Zarif said Iran's government isn't advocating an exit, it is "one of the options that is being advocated by some" in Iran.
Zarif spoke to the AP at the official residence of Iran's ambassador to the U.N., alongside Central Park. The top Iranian diplomat is in the United States this week on a long-shot bid to try to salvage the deal, while laying the groundwork for the United States to bear the blame on the global stage if Trump ultimately pulls out.
Addressing the conflict in Yemen, they said Iran is urging "everybody" to stop attacking civilian areas - including the Houthis. The Iran-backed Shiite rebels control much of Yemen and have been lobbing missiles at Saudi Arabia, which is leading a coalition fighting the Houthis with support from the U.S.
The United States and others insist that Iran is illicitly funneling missiles and other weapons to the Houthis, a charge that Tehran has repeatedly denied. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley has paraded missile parts ostensibly recovered in Saudi Arabia in front of reporters and U.N. Security Council diplomats, arguing that they bear markings and other characteristics proving their Iranian origin.
"I'm not saying Ambassador Haley is fabricating, but somebody is fabricating the evidence they are showing," Zarif said.
As Trump pushes to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria as soon as possible, Zarif gave no signs that Iran plans to do the same. The Iranian military advisers and Iran-backed Shiite militias aiding Syrian President Bashar Assad are a profound concern for the United States and its closest Mideast ally, Israel.
"We are there as long as that objective needs our presence, and as long as the Syrian government asks us to be there," Zarif said.
EL PASO, Texas (AP) — West Texas police have added new charges against the mother of a 4-year-old boy found in February in an abandoned warehouse in Mexico.
Ruby Esmeralda Gonzalez already had been charged with child abandonment and endangerment. Now, police have added charges of intentional injury to a child and filing a false report against the 25-year-old El Paso woman.
Gonzalez initially reported their son had been kidnapped. Investigators now believe Gonzalez took the boy, identified as American, to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, on Feb. 22. They say they left them at an old warehouse and then they returned home. Mexican officials who found the boy say they speak and understands English.
Online records don't list an attorney for Gonzalez, whose bond amounts total $120,000.
The child remains in Mexican social services custody.

Maddie Hanna writes about policy issues, including school funding and affordable housing. They previously covered Gov. Christie and New Jersey state government. They joined the Inquirer in 2012.
A home in Moorestown, which has agreed to plan for more than 300 new affordable-housing units in a settlement over its Mount Laurel housing obligations.
Moorestown Township has planned for more than 300 new low- and moderate-income housing units, and will open the door to redevelopment of Moorestown Mall as part of a settlement over the township's affordable-housing obligations.
The agreement reached Friday between Moorestown — one of South Jersey's more affluent communities — and the Fair Share Housing Center is the latest in a series of settlements by municipalities across the state under the New Jersey Supreme Court's Mount Laurel rulings, which date back decades and require communities to accommodate housing for low- and moderate-income residents.
The settlement “will ensure that hundreds of families across South Jersey will have the opportunity to move into one of the most desirable communities in the state and be able to enjoy the benefits of safe neighborhoods, access to really good schools, and the ability to live close to where they work,” said Anthony Campisi, a spokesperson for Fair Share, a Cherry Hill-based nonprofit.
Moorestown Mayor Stacey Jordan said Monday that “it was extremely hard to get to this place.” The township council decided it was better to settle than to accept Fair Share's calculation of its obligations — which was significantly higher — or let the court decide the matter, Jordan said.
“I think it's the best that we could do for our town,” they said.
In addition to identifying parcels available for the development of housing, Moorestown committed to zone three commercial properties for mixed use: Moorestown Mall, the Lenola Shopping Center and a former Kmart store on Route 38.
For the mall, the zoning change could mean up to 1,065 housing units, including 213 affordable units, according to the agreement, and other uses ranging from retail and dining to offices, entertainment, hotels and open space.
After years of failure by the state to enforce affordable-housing requirements, the state Supreme Court in 2015 directed municipalities that hadn't met their obligations to submit plans for doing so to Superior Court. That led to a battle over how to calculate the requirements in each community — one that the Burlington County township resolved Friday.
Under the settlement, Moorestown identified three other properties for development of mixed market-rate and affordable housing totaling 509 units, including 116 affordable units. It also designated a location for standalone development of 75 affordable family units and opened the door for the township to partner with an organization to develop 20 bedrooms of special-needs housing in group homes in or near residential neighborhoods.
And it plans to provide 15 “accessory apartment” units — created within an existing unit, or as an addition to or in an accessory building — as well as 30 units through a “market-to-affordable” program, buying market-rate units and designating them for low- or moderate-income households.
The agreement specifies that at least 50 percent of new affordable units will be designated for low-income households, including 13 percent for very low-income households. The other 50 percent will be for moderate-income households.
Income limits are based on regional median income, adjusted by household size. For Burlington, Camden, and Gloucester Counties last year, a family of four that earned $66,560 was considered moderate income; $41,600, low income; and $24,960, very low income.
Moorestown also agreed to pay Fair Share $40,000 in attorney fees. It will face other costs for certain housing developments. Jordan declined to estimate those, saying the township was still negotiating with developers. The township has an affordable housing trust fund, funded by developer fees, but Jordan said costs may exceed its value.
Fair Share has reached settlements with more than 190 New Jersey municipalities; more than 100 have not yet settled, Campisi said. A Mercer County judge this month ordered Princeton and West Windsor to plan for more affordable housing, endorsing a methodology that concluded the state should add 155,000 affordable housing units by 2025.
The court must still approve the settlement with Moorestown. Once it does, the township will face 120-day and 180-day deadlines to introduce zoning changes and adopt housing and spending plans.
Regarding the housing calculations, “our politicians throughout the state have not done towns a service by making it go to the courts,” Jordan said. “It limits people's ability to weigh in on it. That's a shame, I think.”

NEW YORK, April 13 Ukraine has partnered with global technology company the Bitfury Group to put a sweeping range of government data on a blockchain platform, the firm's chief executive officer told Reuters, in a project they described as probably the largest of its kind anywhere.
Bitfury, a blockchain company with offices in the United States and overseas, will provide the services to Ukraine, CEO Valery Vavilov said in an interview on Wednesday.
Ukraine's blockchain initiative underscores a growing trend among governments that have adopted the technology to increase efficiencies and improve transparency.
Blockchain is a ledger of transactions that first emerged as the software underpinning digital currency bitcoin. It has become a key global technology in both the public and private sector given its ability to permanently record and keep track of assets or transactions across all industries.
Ukraine and Bitfury signed a memorandum of understanding on Thursday.
Though Vavilov said they were unable to estimate the cost of the project, they said it was by far the biggest government blockchain deal ever. It involves putting all of the Ukraine government's electronic data onto the blockchain platform.
"A secure government system built on the blockchain can secure billions of dollars in assets and make a significant social and economic impact globally by addressing the need for transparency and accountability," said Vavilov.
There are other countries that have started blockchain programs, but they are smaller in scope involving one or two sectors, such as land titles and real estate ownership. Countries that have launched blockchain programs include Sweden, Estonia, and Georgia.
"This agreement will result in an entirely new ecosystem for state projects based on blockchain technology in Ukraine," Oleksandr Ryzhenko, head of the State Agency for eGovernance of Ukraine, said in an emailed response to Reuters questions.
"Our aim is clear and ambitious -- we want to make Ukraine one of the world's leading blockchain nations."
Ukraine's deal with Bitfury will begin with a pilot project to introduce blockchain into the country's digital platform. The areas being explored for the pilot project are state registers, public services, social security, public health, and energy, Vavilov said.
They expect the pilot scheme to launch late this year.
Once the pilot is complete, the blockchain program will expand into all areas, including cybersecurity.
This is Bitfury's second government blockchain project. In April last year, Bitfury signed an agreement with Georgia to pilot the first blockchain land-titling registry. (Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Tom Brown)
MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) - The Catholic Church's decision to join the Australian government's redress plan will ensure compensation will be paid to people who were sexually abused as children by church figures and puts pressure on other institutions to follow suit.
Australia's Catholic bishops and leaders of its religious orders on Wednesday committed to signing on to the 3.8 billion Australian dollar ($2.9 billion) national plan.
The church is the first non-government institution to opt into the plan and estimates it will itself be liable for about AU$1 billion ($757 million) in compensation.
Federal Social Services Minister Dan Tehan expects more institutions to follow, saying there could be further announcements as early as Thursday.
Archbishop of Adelaide Philip Wilson last week became the most senior Catholic cleric in the world to be convicted of covering up child sex abuse. They face a potential two-year prison term when they appear in court in June to be sentenced for protecting a pedophile priest in the 1970s.
Pope Francis' former finance minister, Cardinal George Pell, faces trial on sexual assault charges in Australia. The exact details and nature of the charges have not been disclosed to the public, though police have described them as "historical" sexual assaults, meaning they are alleged to have occurred decades ago.
Catholic leaders have long backed a national redress plan but the churches, charities and other non-government institutions needed the state and territory governments to sign on first.
Western Australia is the final state to join, although state Attorney-General John Quigley said the negotiations with the federal government could be finalized within two months.
The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference and Catholic Religious Australia on Wednesday confirmed the church will enter the plan when it becomes law.
Tehan said the plan was on track to begin on July 1 if legislation passes the Senate.
Sydney Archbishop Anthony Fisher said the church expected to be paying out survivors for "many years to come."
The plan will cover about 60,000 people who were sexually abused as children by institutional figures. Payments will be capped at AU$150,000 ($113,000), with previously received compensation being deducted from any new amount.
The plan was recommended by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, which made its final report in December.
Australia's longest-running royal commission - which is the country's highest form of inquiry - had been investigating since 2012 how the Catholic Church and other institutions responded to sexual abuse of children in Australia over 90 years.
The inquiry heard the testimonies of more than 8,000 survivors of child sex abuse. Of those who were abused in religious institution, 62 percent were Catholics.

Having My Kitchen Rules judge Manu Feildel place food in your mouth is something many would enjoy.
But for contestant Emma, it was their worst nightmare.
The teams were gathered at Italian brothers Josh and Nic's instant restaurant on Tuesday night and entree had just been served.
Sydney sisters Jess and Emma opted for the stuffed zucchini flowers, with the latter turning their nose up at the alternate dish - liver with chilli and onions.
Camera Icon Josh and Nic were the penultimate team to serve up in the instant restaurant round.
“I am so glad I did not order that,” they said, screwing up them face.
Them expression caught the eye of Feildel, who said: “All right, now I am going to ask you a big favour.”
Emma replied: “I am not eating the liver.”
Feildel continued: “I want you to experience something you have never had before. You think it's not good because you know what it is.
“If I come to you with a bit of liver on the fork, please, can I?”
Camera Icon The Italian brothers' overall score of 77 out of 120 was enough to see them through the instant restaurant round.
As the other teams egged Emma on, Feildel came towards them with a fork and fed it to them while they closed their eyes and pinched them nose.
“I don't like it Manu,” they shrieked.
“For this I give you a zero. I can't even deal with what's in my mouth at the moment. It's horrendous.”

The West Australian Video The Melbourne mother-of-four says an internal virus contracted in WA was the reason behind their shock hospital visit on My Kitchen Rules.
However, judge Pete Evans, who was assessing the dish, gave it an eight out of 10.
“My first bite, that chilli excited me...and the liver was pink and tender,” they said.
“This is what I love about cooking - it is better than fine-dining, in my opinion.
“Keep cooking like this and you can go all the way.”
Feildel also praised the zucchini flowers and gave them a nine.
“You stepped away from tradition completely,” they said
Camera Icon Josh and Nic get to work in the kitchen on what was one of the less dramatic nights so far!
“This is a killer - in a good way. Stuffed zucchini flower can sometimes be on the boring side but that was really tasty.”
The brothers turned on each other while plating up the main, yelling across the stove as the clock ticked down.
But the heat paid off - Feildel said the gnocchi quattro formaggi was the best they have had in the competition.

“It was very simple, full of flavour, it was great,” they said, scoring it an eight.
Evans said they liked their spatchcock diavola but the cooking was inconsistent and more marinade was needed, resulting in a six.
“I liked the dish fellas, but it could have been so much better,” they said.
Dessert did not fare so well.

Feildel said the red wine and cinnamon poached pear had an “intense bitterness” to it and only deserved a four.
Evans, meanwhile, liked the flavour of the crostata ricotta but was disappointed with the plating and scored it a five.
Josh and Nic's overall score of 77 out of 120 may not have been enough to top the leaderboard, but it has secured them a place in finals.

Cape Town - Former backyard dwellers say their lives have taken a turn for the better since they moved onto municipal land in Ndlovini informal settlement, Khayelitsha.
All they want now, said the land occupiers, are basic services.
But councillor Stuart Diamond, acting Mayoral Committee member for informal settlements, water and sanitation, says the land is a nature reserve.
“The land has been illegally invaded, and it continues to be viewed as an illegal settlement on a nature reserve,” they said.
Sithembele Thabatha, 46, said they and their wife used to rent a backyard shack in Harare, where they paid R450 a month for rent and R100 for electricity. They work as a polisher at a furniture company in Lansdowne.
“We had difficulty paying rent and supporting my family on my monthly salary, so we made a decision to join other residents who were leaving their rented backyard shacks to build shacks here.”
Now, said Thabatha, they live in their own shack without paying rent and can afford to take a taxi to work, instead of a train.
“Our lives have changed. We no longer stress about rent when the month draws to a close,” they said.
“Now I travel by taxi to work and no longer get into trouble with my boss for coming late,” said Thabatha.
“Because I no longer have to borrow money for rent, I don't have debts.”
They and their wife use a candle to light their new shack and a paraffin stove to cook, they said.
“My baby screams once we extinguish the candle at night because they are scared of darkness. We would be happy if the City could install electricity boxes in our shacks, and put up flush toilets and communal water taps close by,” said Thabatha.
At the moment they get water from communal taps far from their shack.
Thabatha said the residents were vulnerable to criminals because there are no lights on the land.
“Criminals break into our shacks and steal our belongings as soon as we head for work in the morning. They take advantage of our not knowing each other and failure to look after each other's properties,” they said.
Taxis drivers dropped residents far away from their homes, they said.
“I sometimes carry a stick to fend off robbers.”
Community leader Thulani Donki said they and other community leaders marked new shacks with paint.
“We try to control the flow of residents into the new informal settlement. We want to know each and every individual who stays here. We show residents where to erect their shacks so they don't build them haphazardly. We want them to leave space between shacks so that ambulances and fire vehicles can enter the settlement,” Donki said.
Bekithemba Ntshaba, 29, said their girlfriend, a domestic worker, used to spend R400 a month on rent and R100 on electricity while they rented a backyard shack in Ndlovini. They work part-time as a construction worker.
They put up a shack on the land in November last year, but City Law Enforcement demolished it soon afterwards.
“I waited until Law Enforcement stopped demolishing shacks and put my shack up again in February,” they said.
“Since we no longer pay rent, I can send money to my parents in Mount Frere in the Eastern Cape and support my son,” they said.
 They are father to a seven-year-old boy.
Ntshaba uses candles at night, a gas stove to cook and a 25-litre container to store water.
“I want the City to allow us to continue to stay here. Give us toilets, water and electricity instead of demolishing our shacks.”
They said Law Enforcement officials damaged their building materials during demolitions last year.
“I rebuilt the shack with damaged materials, so now it allows rain to come in through leaks on the roof.” During heavy rains last month they and their family spent the night at a friend's place.
“When we returned in the morning, the shack was filled with water and robbers had removed my window.”
Xoliswa Dingiswayo, 40, used to rent a backyard shack for R300 a month. They explained that their financial burden of simultaneously paying rent and supporting their children has been alleviated.
They work as a part-time guard at sports stadiums and has two children.
Since the City has not yet installed toilets in their area, they said, they relieve themselves in the nearby bushes.
Asked about the instalment of communal water taps, toilets and electricity in the new informal settlement, Diamond said that the land is “not suitable for human habitation” but that the City is “investigating the matter”.
No other U.S. state is taking the research-before-legislation route because they realize it is futile, said Jahan Marcu of Americans for Safe Access, a national medical cannabis advocacy group.
"It's never been shown to work in the past, so we are not confident that it's going to serve the needs of patients," they said of the process.
A recent report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine recommended that the gaps in understanding medical cannabis be filled through a national research agenda.
Karen Wilcox, chair of the University of Utah's pharmacology and toxicology department, has spent about 18 months studying how cannabidiol — a derivative of cannabis — can affect seizures. The application process alone took six months.
"It just takes a lot of time and effort to fill out all the paperwork," they said. "It's a nightmare."
Resident Doug Rice said Utah's research-before-legislation approach means their daughter, who has a genetic condition, is missing out on the one drug that completely eliminates their frequent seizures.
The wait for legalization has sent Rice on regular trips to Colorado to get cannabis to treat their 24-year-old daughter Ashley.
Nearly every drug they've tried, including cannabidiol, has failed to stop all of their seizures. Rice said the only time their daughter has a completely seizure free day is when they take them to Colorado, where marijuana is legal, and gives them cannabis twice a day.
"Epilepsy is a deadly disease," they said. "Every seizure takes away a little bit of their brain."
Lawmakers and advocates have pushed for the drug to be declassified and grouped with such drugs as cocaine and opiates, which have medical uses but are still illegal for recreational use.
The change could make it easier to study and prescribe marijuana, but the Obama administration decided against it last year.
Researchers now have to file applications with multiple federal agencies before they can request cannabis products from a university in Mississippi that remains the country's sole source of pot for federally approved research.
Ethan Russo, medical director at the clinical research organization Phytecs, is working on a Johns Hopkins University research project on how components of cannabis impact mood and memory. They said the research team submitted the proposal about a year ago and is still working to get funding approval from the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
So far, there are a handful of projects being considered at the University of Utah, including how cannabidiol impacts people who have autism and anxiety and its effect on post-traumatic stress disorder. But it will likely take years before any of those studies are completed.

Columbia study shows that altering activity in brain's emotion center can eliminate the natural craving for sweet; findings could inform treatments for eating disorders
NEW YORK -- New research in mice has revealed that the brain's underlying desire for sweet, and its distaste for bitter, can be erased by manipulating neurons in the amygdala, the emotion center of the brain.
The study showed that removing an animal's capacity to crave or despise a taste had no impact on its ability to identify it. The findings suggest that the brain's complex taste system -- which produces an array of thoughts, memories and emotions when tasting food -- are actually discrete units that can be individually isolated, modified or removed all together. The research points to new strategies for understanding and treating eating disorders including obesity and anorexia nervosa.
The research was published today in Nature.
"When our brain senses a taste it not only identifies its quality, it choreographs a wonderful symphony of neuronal signals that link that experience to its context, hedonic value, memories, emotions and the other senses, to produce a coherent response," said Charles S. Zuker, PhD, a principal investigator at Columbia's Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute and the paper's senior author.
Today's study builds upon earlier work by Dr. Zuker and their team to map the brain's taste system. Previously, the researchers revealed that when the tongue encounters one of the five tastes -- sweet, bitter, salty, sour or umami -- specialized cells on the tongue send signals to specialized regions of the brain so as to identify the taste, and trigger the appropriate actions and behaviors.
To shed light on that experience, the scientists focused on sweet and bitter taste and the amygdala, a brain region known to be important for making value judgments about sensory information. Previous research by Dr. Zuker, a professor of biochemistry and molecular biophysics and of neuroscience and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, and others showed that the amygdala connects directly to the taste cortex.
"Our earlier work revealed a clear divide between the sweet and bitter regions of the taste cortex," said Li Wang, PhD, a postdoctoral research scientist in the Zuker lab and the paper's first author. "This new study showed that same division continued all the way into the amygdala. This segregation between sweet and bitter regions in both the taste cortex and amygdala meant we could independently manipulate these brain regions and monitor any resulting changes in behavior."
The scientists performed several experiments in which the sweet or bitter connections to the amygdala were artificially switched on, like flicking a series of light switches. When the sweet connections were turned on, the animals responded to water just as if it were sugar. And by manipulating the same types of connections, the researchers could even change the perceived quality of a taste, turning sweet into an aversive taste, or bitter into an attractive one.
In contrast, when the researchers instead turned off the amygdala connections but left the taste cortex untouched, the mice could still recognize and distinguish sweet from bitter, but now lacked the basic emotional reactions, like preference for sugar or aversion to bitter.
"It would be like taking a bite of your favorite chocolate cake but not deriving any enjoyment from doing so," said Dr. Wang. "After a few bites, you may stop eating, whereas otherwise you would have scarfed it down."
Usually, the identity of a food and the pleasure one feels when eating it are intertwined. But the researchers showed that these components can be isolated from each other, and then manipulated separately. This suggests that the amygdala could be a promising area of focus when looking for strategies to treat eating disorders.
In the immediate future, Drs. Zuker and Wang are investigating additional brain regions that serve critical roles in the taste system. For example, the taste cortex also links directly to regions involved in motor actions, learning and memory.
"Our goal is to piece together how those regions add meaning and context to taste," said Dr. Wang. "We hope our investigations will help to decipher how the brain processes sensory information and brings richness to our sensory experiences."

A family home just over the Gloucestershire border in Hereford is being searched today as part of an investigation into the deaths of babies at a hospital in Cheshire.
Police are questioning a health worker on suspicion of murdering eight newborn babies. The woman is also being questioned about the attempted murder of another six children at a neo natal unit.
It is understood they were arrested at a semi-detached house, just a mile from the Countess of Chester Hospital in Cheshire, early this morning.
Police have not confirmed the name of the arrested woman.
The house which was being searched today belongs to nurse Lucy Letby, 28, who is believed to live in the property, the Mirror Online has reported.
(Image: Chester Standard / SWNS.com)
Miss Letby, a qualified children's nurse, graduated from the University of Chester seven years ago and has worked at the hospital ever since. In a local newspaper article five years ago they were pictured in their nurse's uniform, holding a baby-grow.
A blue forensic tent was erected this morning on the driveway of their modern three-bedroomed property.
Teams of officers wearing blue gloves were seen going in and out of the house, which was cordoned off with police tape.
Police were also at the home of Miss Letby's parents, John, 72, and Susan, 58, in Hereford today, a market town just over the Gloucestershire border
Today's arrest is part of a long-running investigation following a high number of baby deaths at the hospital.
In May last year police began looking at the deaths of 15 babies between June 2015 and June 2016.
Police investigation
Detectives yesterday (Tuesday) said they are now looking into the deaths of 17 babies and 15 non-fatal collapses between March 2015 and July 2016.
Detective Inspector Paul Hughes, in charge of the investigation for Cheshire Police, said: “The investigation into the neonatal unit at the Countess of Chester Hospital is continuing.
“Since it was first launched in May 2017, a dedicated team of detectives has been working tirelessly on this case.
“This is a highly complex and very sensitive investigation and, as you can appreciate, we need to ensure we do everything we possibly can to try to establish in detail what has led to these baby deaths and collapses.
“When the investigation was first launched it was focusing on the deaths of 15 babies that occurred between the period of June 2015 and June 2016.
“In addition the investigation was also conducting a review of six non-fatal collapses during the same period.

“Since the start of our inquiries and as the information gathering process has continued, the scope of the investigation has now widened. We are now currently investigating the deaths of 17 babies and 15 non-fatal collapses between the period of March 2015 and July 2016.
“Due to the nature of the case and as part of our ongoing inquiries, we have consulted with a number of medical specialists to ensure that we carry out as thorough an investigation as possible. We have also spoken to a large number of people to gather as much information as we can.
“As a result of our ongoing inquiries we have today arrested a healthcare professional in connection with the investigation.
“She was arrested earlier this morning on suspicion of murder in relation to eight of the babies and attempted murder in relation to six of the babies and is currently in custody.
“Whilst this is a significant step forward in our inquiries it is important to remember that the investigation is very much active and ongoing at this stage.
“There are no set timescales for this coming to a conclusion but we remain committed to carrying out a thorough investigation as soon as possible.
“We recognise that this investigation has a huge impact on all of the families, staff and patients at the hospital as well as members of the public.
“Parents of all the babies are continuing to be kept fully updated and are being supported throughout the process by specially trained officers.”
Hospital statement
The hospital carried out a number of independent expert medical reviews into the deaths before calling in police.
Medical director Ian Harvey said: “We are continuing to support Cheshire Police with their ongoing investigation.
“Asking the police to look into this was not something we did lightly, but we need to do everything we can to understand what has happened here and get the answers we and the families so desperately want.
“The Countess is now equivalent to a Level 1 special care baby unit and we are confident the unit is safe to continue in its current form.”
“Unexplained” deaths
A report published in July 2016 by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) found significant gaps in medical and nursing rotas and insufficient staffing for the provision of longer term high dependency and some intensive care.
The RCPCH report said paediatric consultants had been concerned since June 2015 about a higher than usual number of deaths on the ward, several of which were “unexplained” or “unexpected”.
Pryers Solicitors, from York, is currently acting on behalf of two babies who received treatment at the Counter of Chester Hospital.
Neil Fearn, the CEO of the firm, said: “The death of any child is a tragedy, but this is exacerbated in circumstances where questions remain unanswered.
“However, we are reassured that the investigation is still ongoing, and that there are further steps to be taken. We are hopeful that the investigation can provide answers for the families of these children.”
Reigning Formula Renault 2.0 Northern European Cup champion Michaël Benyahia will make the move into EuroFormula Open in 2018 after becoming RP Motorsport's fourth confirmed driver.
The American-born Moroccan joins Felipe Drugovich, Guilherme Samaia and Aldo Festante at the Italian outfit, with Benyahia having impressed the team sufficiently during the recent Winter Series races at the Circuit Paul Ricard to secure a drive for the main championship this year.
Benyahia is already a test driver for the Venturi Formula E team, becoming the youngest driver to drive the Formula E car during the rookie test in January, but they are now looking forward to their maiden Formula 3 campaign with RP Motorsport.
“It is an honour for me to debut in the EuroFormula Open Championship with an important team like RP Motorsport,” said Benyahia. “I am happy to be able to face this new step in my career, which will allow me to grow and gain new experience at the wheel of very demanding and performing cars.
“I can't wait to get back on track and represent the flag of my country that follows me with great affection.”
Team manager Niki Rocca is convinced about the talent of Benyahia, and feels the Moroccan will benefit from working with RP Motorsport in 2018 in order to become a more developed driver.
“We are very pleased to have signed an agreement with a very young and promising driver like Michaël,” said Rocca. “Already during their still short career they had the opportunity to show excellent numbers, confirmed by the excellent approach they had with this category during testing at Paul Ricard.
“We are convinced that we can work well together and allow them to grow further thanks to the experience of our team.”
KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) – Chiefs linebacker Derrick Johnson expects to be back by training camp after tearing their Achilles tendon late last year and missing the end of the regular season and playoffs.
The four-time Pro Bowl linebacker ruptured their right Achilles tendon in a game against Oakland. It was the opposite tendon from the one they tore in 2014, missing almost the entire season.
Johnson said that rehab has been going well and they expect to be “100 percent” when the Chiefs convene at Missouri Western for training camp in late July. But they don't want to put a date on their return, and it is possible he'll miss the entire offseason program, which officially began on Monday.
Chiefs coach Andy Reid likewise was optimistic Johnson will be ready for next season.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The national security adviser is the president's policy whisperer and confidant on military matters, diplomacy, intelligence, terrorism — even the odd hurricane. The adviser usually enjoys unmatched trust with the chief executive and lots of behind-the-scenes clout.
A human-made hurricane consumed the latest one.
A look at the job:
OUT LIKE FLYNN
Advertisement
No other national security adviser has gone out quite like Michael Flynn, who lasted less than a month, a record low. Before Flynn was forced out as President Donald Trump's national security adviser, the Obama administration fired them for insubordination in 2014, when they were defense intelligence chief.
At issue this time: Flynn's contact with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. late last year, which raised questions about whether they were freelancing on policy about Russian sanctions while President Barack Obama was still in office and how they misled Trump officials about the calls. Trump wanted them to step down because of an “eroding level of trust,” said White House spokesperson Sean Spicer.
___
AT THE CENTER
In their brief tenure, Flynn was at the heart of deliberations over provocative missile tests by North Korea and Iran, close to the president's side in their meetings and calls with world leaders and privy to all manner of secrets by virtue of their position straddling the military, diplomatic and intelligence components of national security.
Democrats want to find out when Trump knew of the circumstances that eventually got Flynn fired and why they were allowed to maintain their access when it emerged that they had not given an accurate account of their communications with the ambassador.
___
‘DE-HOT' THE WORLD:
That's how banker Robert Cutler described the nature of their counsel to President Dwight D. Eisenhower when they served as the first national security adviser, starting in 1953.
Cutler set the template in terms of discretion. Said their New York Times obituary in 1974: “No man in the Government, except the President, knew more of the nation's strategic secrets; yet no other man so high in the Administration was so little known outside the President's inner circle.”
___
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THEY'RE PEACENIKS
Hardly. There have been hawks aplenty. McGeorge Bundy, for one, pushed an expansion of U.S. fighting in Vietnam while working as national security adviser to presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson.
___
NOT HOUSEHOLD NAMES
Many aren't well-known to the public when they come into the job or all that famous when they leave. Dillon Anderson, anyone? They served in 1955-56.
Among the very well known: the two women, among 20 men, who have been national security adviser: Condoleezza Rice, who served George W. Bush in their first term before becoming secretary of state; and Susan Rice, Obama's second-term national security adviser. Rice was ambassador to the U.N. in their first term.
Trump on Tuesday appointed retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg on an acting basis.
___
OH HENRY
It's hard to overstate the influence Henry Kissinger wielded on Richard Nixon from the dawn of their presidency to its bitter final days.
Kissinger was such a driver of foreign policy and more that Nixon had them multitask as national security adviser and secretary of state during their second term, abbreviated by Nixon's 1974 resignation. Kissinger, the longest-serving national security adviser, kept both jobs for more than a year under President Gerald Ford, then finished Ford's term as secretary of state only.
Colin Powell was national security adviser under Ronald Reagan and later chairperson of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, and secretary of state under George W. Bush.
___
WHAT COUNTS AS NATIONAL SECURITY?
National security advisers have not been limited to traditional threats to the U.S. Stephen Hadley, for example, was involved in the federal emergency response to Hurricane Katrina during George W. Bush's administration and Susan Rice took up climate change as a matter of national security during Obama's second term.
× Expressway Expected to Close for Bridge Work for Next Three Days
SCRANTON — Thousands of cars and trucks use the Central Scranton Expressway to get from downtown Scranton to Interstate 81.
Starting Tuesday, April 18, they will have to find another route.
PennDOT has given a contractor permission to close the outbound lane only. Outbound was already down to one lane.
It's all so the contractor can do more work on the new Harrison Avenue Bridge which passes over the expressway.
There will be some pothole patching as well.
The same thing is scheduled to happen Wednesday, April 19 and Thursday, April 20 from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.
A detour is in place. To get from downtown Scranton, drivers can take Moosic Street to Meadow Avenue to get on Interstate 81.
The new Harrison Avenue Bridge is expected to be finished this summer.
This section of the Central Scranton Expressway was closed last week for work on the new Harrison Avenue Bridge.
Pipeline (Photo by Tom Pennington/Getty Images, File)
LANSING (WWJ.AP) – A government panel is urging the temporary shutdown of twin oil pipelines in the Straits of Mackinac until the company that operates them can finish inspections and repair coating gaps.
The Michigan Pipeline Safety Advisory Board on Monday approved the non-binding resolution after some board members expressed opposition to a recent deal between Gov. Rick Snyder's administration and Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge Inc., regarding Line 5.
The board was not consulted in the agreement, which included a trigger for a temporary shutdown of flow through the pipeline in “adverse weather conditions,” defined as when waves reached an average of 8 feet. While those conditions were met last week, the resolutions urge that definition to be modified to three feet and include ice cover and other conditions when the Coast Guard would be impeded from an oil spill response.
“These resolutions seek to strengthen the agreement the Governor signed with Enbridge so that it actually does what it purports to do: provide a path forward for determining the future of Line 5 while protecting the Great Lakes,” said Mike Shriberg, executive director of the National Wildlife Federation Great Lakes Regional Center and a member of the Pipeline Safety Advisory Board, who co-sponsored the resolutions. “While the few services Line 5 provides to Michigan have been shown to have feasible alternatives, there is no substitute for the Great Lakes and our way of life.”
Other resolutions OK'd Monday calls on the state to propose an amendment to close the pipelines if waves are higher than 3 feet, rather than 8.
Line 5 carries 23 million gallons (87 million liters) daily between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario. Long-term options include placing the lines in an underground tunnel or shutting them down.

NEW YORK (AP) — Dick Clark Productions is hitting back against Mariah Carey's claim it sabotaged their live performance on its “New Year's Rockin' Eve” special.
Carey's disaster during the annual New Year's Eve special in Times Square made international headlines: The superstar vocally stumbled through their short set, failing to sing for most of it despite a pre-recorded track of their songs playing in the background.
Carey was visibly upset during the performance and afterward tweeted “(expletive) happens.” Them representative Nicole Perna blamed technical difficulties, and in an interview with Billboard they said Dick Clark Productions hampered Carey's performance.
“She was not winging this moment and took it very seriously,” Perna told Billboard. “A shame that production set them up to fail.”
Perna said Carey's earpiece wasn't working and they flagged the issue to the production team but was told it would be OK when they got on stage.
“However, that was not the case, and they were again told that their earpiece was not working,” Perna said. “Instead of endeavoring to fix the issue so that Mariah could perform, they went live.”
In a statement released on Sunday, the production company called such claims “absurd.”
“As the premier producer of live television events for nearly 50 years, we pride ourselves on our reputation and long-standing relationships with artists,” it said. “To suggest that dcp (Dick Clark Productions), as producer of music shows including the American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, New Year's Rockin' Eve and Academy of Country Music Awards, would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd.”
It said that in “very rare instances” there are technical errors that can occur with live television. It said an initial investigation, however, indicated it had no involvement in the challenges associated with Carey's performance.
“We want to be clear that we have the utmost respect for Ms. Carey as an artist and acknowledge their tremendous accomplishments in the industry,” it said.
A person familiar with the production of the show who asked for anonymity to speak publicly about the incident said all of the other performers, including Gloria Estefan, rehearsed onsite for their performances and Carey was there but had a stand-in for their rehearsal, atypical for the show's performers. The person said all of the monitors were working and no technical problems were found.
Ironically, Carey was Dick Clark Productions' first live performer for the broadcast in 2005, when it went off without any such problems.

YOKOSUKA, Japan (AP) — An industrial group developing nuclear decommissioning technology has unveiled a swimming robot designed to be used underwater to investigate damage in three reactors at the wrecked Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant in northeastern Japan.
Remote controlled robots are key to the decades-long decommissioning process, but super-high radiation hampered earlier attempts to probe damage to the reactors from meltdowns following a massive earthquake and tsunami in March 2011.
The developers said Thursday they plan to send the probe into the primary containment vessel of Unit 3 at Fukushima this summer to study the extent of damage and locate parts of melted fuel that is thought to have fallen to the bottom of the chamber and been submerged by highly radioactive water.
Japan hopes to start removing the fuel after Tokyo's 2020 Olympics.
[India], Dec 11 (ANI): Former prime minister Manmohan Singh on Monday quashed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's accusation about the former's clandestine meeting with Pakistani officials, and expressed 'anguish' at 'the canards being spread' by the latter.
"I am deeply pained and anguished by the falsehood and canards being spread to score political points in a lost cause by none less than Prime Minister, Sh. Narender Modi. Fearing imminent defeat in Gujarat, desperation of Prime Minister to hurl every abuse and latch on to every straw is palpable," Singh said in an official statement.
In one of their campaign rallies yesterday, Prime Minister Modi alleged Pakistan's interference in the Gujarat elections. Claiming that Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar, former prime minister Manmohan Singh and former vice president Hamid Ansari met with Pakistan's High Commissioner and Foreign Minister at Aiyar's house just before the elections, the Prime Minister sought an explanation from the opposition.
Terming it a lie, Singh issued a clarification as follows, "I reject the innuendos and falsehoods as I did not discuss Gujarat elections with anyone else at the dinner hosted by Shri Mani Shankar Aiyar as alleged by Shri Modi. Nor was the Gujarat issue raised by anyone else present at the dinner."
The former prime minister, in turn raked up Prime Minister Modi's visit to Pakistan after the terror attacks in Udhampur and Gurdaspur, and sought explanation from them for the same.
"Let me remind Sh. Narender Modi that they had gone to Pakistan uninvited after the terrorist attacks in Udhampur and Gurdaspur. Let them also tell the country the reason for inviting the infamous ISI of Pakistan to our strategic Air Base in Pathankot to investigate a terror attack that emanated from Pakistan," the statement read.
Calling out the Prime Minister's "compromised track record on fighting terrorism," Singh said that their own track record over last five decades cannot be questioned by the former "to gain lost political ground."
Singh also demanded an apology from the Prime Minister for the grave accusation made by them
"I sincerely hope that they will apologize to the nation for their ill thought transgression to restore the dignity of the office they occupy," Singh added. (ANI)
Uber has halted its self-driving trials across the US after one of its autonomous vehicles was involved in a fatal accident in Tempe, Arizona. The accident may prove to be a defining moment for the autonomous-car industry.
More details: The accident happened last night when a woman walked into the road in front of a vehicle traveling in self-driving mode. Uber says a safety driver was behind the wheel but no passengers were in the car. It isn't clear yet whether the car's self-driving system could have avoided the accident. Uber says it is cooperating with the investigation.
What it means: Experts have long worried that a negative public reaction to the first serious accidents involving self-driving vehicles could cool enthusiasm for the technology and lead to onerous regulations.
Past accidents: This is the first time a self-driving car has killed a pedestrian. But there have been accidents involving semi-automated systems. Most prominently, the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed in May 2016 when their car crashed into a truck while driving in Autopilot mode.

Later this semester, the University of Cincinnati is hosting academic workshops on the topics of “white tears” and “white fragility.”
The workshop, which is entitled, “White Fragilty, White Tears, and White Allies: Learning to manage emotion in difficult conversations about race and racism” will take place on April 3rd at the University of Cincinnati.
SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER
Workshop leader Ainsley Lambert, a PhD student, will argue that white folks often struggle and get defensive in conversations about race due to the concept of “white fragility.”
According to an academic journal, white fragility is defined as “a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable, triggering a range of defensive moves. These moves include the outward display of emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt, and behaviors such as argumentation, silence, and leaving the stress-inducing situation. These behaviors, in turn, function to reinstate white racial equilibrium.”
The journal goes on to suggest that white individuals in a conversation about race often experience “anger, fear, and guilt, and behaviors such as argumentation, silence, and leaving the stress-inducing situation. These behaviors, in turn, function to reinstate white racial equilibrium.”
The Root, a blog that is part of the Gizmodo network, claimed that “white tears” is phrased used to “describe what happens when certain types of white people either complain about a nonexistent racial injustice or are upset by a nonwhite person's success at the supposed expense of a white person.
Lambert's faculty biography claims that they are “committed to applying their research expertise to create a more diverse and inclusive campus climate at the University of Cincinnati in which all students, staff, and faculty are able to thrive.”
West Coast midfielder Dom Sheed has been left out of the team for Saturday night's game against St Kilda at Optus Stadium.
Sheed was listed as an omission when the teams were released this afternoon, one of two changes after Chris Masten's hamstring injury.
Star onballer Luke Shuey returns after their own hamstring injury and is joined on the list of inclusions by defender Jackson Nelson.
The Saints have added Rowan Marshall and Mav Weller to the side which lost to Richmond last week, replacing Jake Carlisle (suspension) and Luke Dunstan, who was listed as injured.
Sheed was sidelined after round six with a nagging foot injury.
They returned two weeks later and had a quiet game against Richmond, but was back in the hunt in the win over Hawthorn last week, picking up 22 touches, five tackles and five clearances.
The 23-year-old is averaging a career-high 23 disposals, 10 contested possessions and five clearances this season.

Mark Yates' Solihull Moors secured National League survival with a 2-1 win at Tranmere Rovers on Tuesday night.
When the former Cheltenham Town boss took over in November, they had picked up just 11 points in 19 games and were six points from safety.
They had conceded 41 goals in 19 games, but Yates has turned things around and they have let in only 15 goals in the last 26.
Yates, who has also managed Kidderminster Harriers and Crawley Town, said the achievement ranks right up there with their achievements as a manager so far.
"I haven't won anything, so it's right up there," they said.
"I back myself and I think I am a decent manager and a decent coach.
"I had four good years at Kidderminster and then what I think were five decent years at Cheltenham.
"Then the toughest year ever at Crawley and this ranks with what I did at Crawley, that's how tough that job was.
"I had been out of the game for 18 months and you start wondering whether to become a bin man or something!
"But I am really enjoying it here and it's the local club for me in terms of the National League and only a half an hour drive. I love coming into work here."
One of the key men in Solihull's resurgent form has been Kyle Storer, who joined them from Cheltenham in January.
"He's been outstanding, in the last five or six games in particular, and that's why I brought them in," Yates said.
Fellow ex-Robins players Darren Carter and Omari Sterling-James have also helped the Moors pull clear of danger.
The seemingly endless war between Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart and their children Bianca and John resumed before a WA judge yesterday, as the legal battle over who owns how much of the multibillion-dollar Hope Downs iron ore operation returned to court.
Having already been fought before the NSW and Federal courts, this week it is the turn of Supreme Court Justice Rene Le Miere to try to unpick 40 years of argument over the massive mining legacy left by Mrs Rinehart's father Lang Hancock.
Central to the hearing are the allegations of Mrs Rinehart's son, John Hancock, and daughter, Bianca Rinehart, that their mother engaged in a “fraudulent and dishonest design” to deprive them of what they say was their rightful share of the family fortune.
Also embedded is Wright Prospecting, controlled by descendants of Lang Hancock's late business partner Peter Wright, which is suing Hancock Prospecting over the ownership of iron ore rich land known as Hope Downs 4, 5 and 6.
They want to take their claim to a trial — but Mrs Rinehart, as they have done at so many legal hearings, wants to go to private arbitration to thrash out the issues away from the public gaze.
That was what the Full Federal Court ruled should happen late last year.

And yesterday, Hancock Prospecting's Sydney silk Noel Hutley SC, and Mrs Rinehart's own lawyer Steven Finch said that decision should be followed by the WA court.
But barrister Christopher Withers, representing Mrs Rinehart's children, said Mrs Rinehart's argument was based around a clause in the “unconscionable” Hope Downs deed which they claimed Bianca was “bullied” into signing.
Mr Withers said that deed was only drawn up after Mrs Rinehart had expressed a desire to cut their son John out of the family trust altogether, but was told by their lawyers that they could not.
They said to place the WA case in arbitration would delay the action for years, which they said would be unfair on Wright Prospecting. They revealed the Federal Court battle between Mrs Rinehart and their children was now on its way to the High Court.
“The parties cannot agree about much ... 31/2 years in we are still having the debate about where to have the debate,” Mr Withers said.
CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - Years after a woman accused a police officer of yanking them out of their car and slamming their face-first while handcuffed to the ground, a federal grand jury has charged them with using excessive force and misconduct in office.
The U.S. Justice Department said in a news release that former Hickory Police Sgt. Robert Michael George injured Chelsea Doolittle and filed a false report in 2013.
George, who said they fell, was fired a year later and charged in state court with assault.
Doolittle sued George and the city of Hickory in 2016 after enduring two oral surgeries.
District Attorney David Learner says the state charges are being dropped now that federal charges have been filed.
George's attorney, Lisa Dubs, did not comment.
Both George and Doolittle are white.
CLEVELAND (AP) — The Green Bay Packers came back to set the stage for Aaron Rodgers' comeback.
Brett Hundley threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Davante Adams in overtime as the Packers rallied from a two-touchdown deficit in the fourth quarter for a 27-21 win on Sunday over the Cleveland Browns, who remain winless.
Cleveland fell to 0-13 and made too many crucial mistakes to break into the win column.
On third-and-6, Hundley threw a short pass to Adams, who broke a tackle and went in untouched with 5:05 left as the Packers (7-6) won in overtime for the second straight week — and third time this season. The Packers have stayed alive in the playoff race without Rodgers, who has been out since Oct. 15 with a broken collarbone but is expected to play next Sunday.
It was another devastating loss for the Browns (0-13). Green Bay's TD came after safety Josh Jones intercepted Browns rookie DeShone Kizer, who inexplicably threw the ball up for grabs while being pressured by Clay Matthews.

Dennis Basso's resort collection was quite transportive. “The whole feeling was: the south of France, Provence, summer, lavender in the fields, botanical, young gorgeous girls, chateaus, the riviera and beautiful parties — light and cool and breezy and young and modern and sexy, without showing a lot of skin,” expressed the designer at a preview in their Madison Avenue store.
A floral hand-embroidered chiffon and tulle gown opened the presentation. “I wanted it to be light and textured; sundress meets party dress,” Basso said. On this note, they delivered lace and floral printed gazaar layered gowns as well as three-dimensional details: case in point, a playful botanical printed mini with hand-embroidered feathered hem. Elsewhere, fluid glamorous gowns served an old Hollywood yet modern appeal: for example, a memorable cream hand pleated chiffon gown with knotted bodice which featured a matching blouse underlay. “This could be a wedding dress — with the blouse for the ceremony, without it for the party” Basso noted.
Basso is known for their furs so the way to approach them in this context was again, as lightly as possible. The standout: a cream gradient mink, sable and fawn vest, which they paired with the airiest of georgette pants.

NEW YORK (AP) — The Chicago Cubs have drafted Chris Singleton, whose mother was among those killed two years ago during the shooting inside a South Carolina church.
Singleton was selected Wednesday by the defending World Series champions with the final pick of the 19th round, No. 585 overall.  They are a right-handed-hitting center fielder at Charleston Southern University.
The outfielder's mother, Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, was one of nine people killed by Dylann Roof on June 17, 2015, during a Wednesday night Bible study at Emanuel AME Church in downtown Charleston, South Carolina, one of the South's first African-American churches.
Coleman-Singleton, who was 45, was a track coach at Goose Creek High School.

In a news release detailing the amateur draft, Major League Baseball says Chris Singleton was honored by the New York Yankees during the team's annual HOPE Week in 2015, “following their courageous response to the tragic shooting inside a Charleston, South Carolina church that claimed the life of their mother.”
HAYANGE, France (AP) — Two things now grow around the rusting carcasses of the last blast furnaces in this French steel town: weeds, and votes for populist Marine Le Pen.
For months, labor leader Walter Broccoli fought to keep the fires burning, fearing that failure could drive enraged workers toward Le Pen and their virulently nationalistic politics. They never imagined their own son would become part of the stampede.
They say they've not spoken in the three years since they discovered to their horror that David Broccoli registered as a candidate in municipal elections for Le Pen's anti-European Union, anti-immigration National Front.
“I said to myself, ‘Impossible! What's happened to him?' I called them up. We argued. They told me, ‘That's the way it is' and hung up on me,” Walter Broccoli says. “I've had nightmares where I saw them dressed in an SS uniform, all in black, with a cap. I took it very hard.”

Yet the National Front is now an inescapable part of the landscape in France's industrial eastern rustbelt. Le Pen is projected to win millions of votes Sunday in the first round of France's two-stage presidential election, likely catapulting them to within one step of an electoral earthquake that would shake France and the EU to its core.
For some disgruntled working-class voters, a ballot for the anti-establishment Le Pen is a yell of protest — their nuclear option against the political mainstream.
steelworker Pascal Grimmer says she'll get their vote because he's “angry with politicians, filled with rage,” and “she is the candidate who most scares the others.”
They hope an electro-shock-high score for Le Pen will jolt mainstream politicians “to ask themselves, ‘What do people want?'”
“You reap what you sow,” they say. “Our politicians have treated the French people like idiots.”
Last time, Grimmer voted Francois Hollande, the Socialist whose presidency, now in its final weeks, lasted just one term.
Grimmer was impressed when Hollande came stumping during the 2012 campaign for working-class votes at the ArcelorMittal steel plant where they work. Labor leaders were in the thick of their battle to save Hayange's furnaces. Hollande clambered onto the roof of a van with union leaders, took a microphone and promised a law to help save plants facing closure.
“I said to myself, ‘Oh, I like this guy.' Naively, I believed him,” Grimmer recalls.
Workers felt betrayed when the furnaces were extinguished in 2013. Hollande's Socialist government struck a deal with steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal that secured jobs elsewhere or retirement for the furnace workers. ArcelorMittal also promised to invest 180 million euros ($190 million at today's rates) in other sectors of the steel works that still produce high-grade metals for automakers and other clients.
Still, the mothballing of the furnaces hit hard. Grimmer, Broccoli and other members of their Workers' Force labor union unveiled a plaque of protest in Hayange when the scorching fires which had melted ores into metal went cold.
“SELLOUT,” the plaque read. “Here lie the promises of change that F. HOLLANDE made to workers and their families.”
Broccoli says they warned Socialist officials that extinguishing the furnaces would be “electoral suicide.” Sure enough, the year after they were put out, Hayange voted in a National Front mayor.
“It really hurts me to see workers turning toward fascism, the extreme right,” Broccoli says. “They are so angry that they are prepared to vote National Front, to destroy everything.”
Broccoli's son, a computer technician, doesn't work in the steel industry. Still, the father assumes their son felt “abandoned by the government” after losing a job in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.
“I feel as though he's been stolen from me,” Walter Broccoli says.
David Broccoli didn't respond to calls from The Associated Press. Herve Hoff, who stood with them as a National Front candidate in 2014, says David Broccoli felt betrayed by the left and “adopted our ideas.”
In Hayange, where the decaying furnaces dominate the skyline, the unemployment rate is 14 percent, according to the mayor — more than the already high national average of 10 percent. Still, National Front Mayor Fabien Engelmann smugly presents themselves as an example of what their party can do with power.
“I didn't lie to my voters,” they say. “I offered them a coherent program: security, cleanliness, lower taxes, reduced debts, road building, work on schools — things a mayor can do.”
× Blight Money to Stabilize Collapsing Building
SHAMOKIN — Shamokin city leaders had an emergency meeting Monday morning after an old dress factory started collapsing.
The city has been left to clean up the mess but doesn't have the money to do it.
The building on North Shamokin Street is a former dress factory and it started to collapse on Sunday.
The city's main goal is to figure out how to stabilize the building and now they have the money to do it.
Drone video of the former dress factory shows the terrible shape the place is in and how it is slowly collapsing.
Shamokin's mayor tells Newswatch 16 the Northumberland County Housing Authority has raised money to help communities in situations like this.
The housing authority has agreed to give the city around $10,000 to use toward stabilizing the building.
City officials had already been working with the group for weeks to fix the building things were kicked into high gear over the weekend when part of the building collapsed onto the street, knocking out power to 1,200 homes and businesses for part of Easter Sunday.
“And then it happened, so we're now and we've committed, the housing authority has committed up to $10,000 in the short term to help alleviate this problem,” said authority member Ed Christiano.
Ask the neighbors what they think of this building — the former dress company that's been closed for about 25 years and they'll tell you it's like living across the street from a ticking time bomb.
“Each day or each rainy day or snow I would be like, ‘oh, it's going to come down,'” said neighbor Pat Herrold.
“Felt like a very low-grade earthquake, looked out my window and I saw all the wires flapping in the wind,” recalled neighbor Mary Sperow.
No homes were damaged and no one was hurt but people in Shamokin were left without power on a holiday.
“And then it was like 6:30, 7 until the power came back on so what are you going to do, have Easter at 2 o'clock in the morning?”
Shamokin's mayor tells us they want to eventually demolish the building, but that could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Right now they only have enough money to stabilize the building and hope to see a crew working by the end of the week.

The Eagles will have live tackling periods in training camp this year.
Although tackling is fundamental in the NFL, it has become less common during training camp practices. The Eagles seldom tackled during Chip Kelly's practices. Coach Doug Pederson reintroduced it last year, but they pulled back on live tackling after there were injuries in the first week of camp. Pederson said Wednesday that the Eagles will tackle this summer.
"I'm going in with the same mentality," Pederson said. "We're going to stay aggressive and we're going to hit and we'll put the pads on. I think off the top of my head, I believe we have like three live practice days that we'll tackle and take guys to the ground. Other than that, everything will be what we call 'thud' or in pads."

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) - The suspect in February's massacre at a Florida high school made chilling cellphone videos announcing their intention to become the next school shooter, aiming to kill at least 20 people and saying "you're all going to die."
The three videos released by prosecutors Wednesday were found on the cellphone of suspect Nikolas Cruz after the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that killed 17 people.
Cruz introduces themselves in the first video and says they are "going to be the next school shooter of 2018." They go on to say that they want to use an AR-15 to kill at least 20 people and specifies the high school in Parkland. They laugh and then says, "You're all going to die."
Cruz is charged with 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder.

French filmmaker Luc Besson criticized Hollywood films like Marvel's Captain America, calling them “propaganda” that too often “show the supremacy of America.”
In an interview with Brazilian journalist Renato Marafon, Besson said he's “totally tired” of the superhero film genre.

“I mean, it was great 10 years ago when we saw the first Spider-Man, Iron Man. Now it's like, number five, six, seven,” Besson explained. “The superhero is working with another superhero, but it's not the same family. I'm lost.”
“What bothers me most, is that it's always here to show the supremacy of America, and how they are great,” the Fifth Element director continued. “I mean, which country in the world would have the guts to call a film, ‘Captain Brazil,' or ‘Captain France?' I mean, no one. We would be so ashamed and say, ‘No, no, c'mon, we can't do that.' They can. They can call it ‘Captain America' and everybody thinks it's normal.”
“I'm not here for propaganda, I'm here to tell a story,” Besson said of their latest film, Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. “And Valerian is another proposal, different, where, you really travel.”
“You meet aliens, a lot. And there are real themes,” Besson says of their film, which has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 50 and massively underperformed at the box office, earning $90 million a month after its release. The film was made on a reported $180 million budget.
“I mean, Valerian and Laureline are not superheroes, they're not even heroes,” Besson adds. “They're people like you and me. They're cops, they do their job. But sometimes, they can be heroic. That's what I love, because I can relate to that. I can't relate to a superhero, I don't have superpowers.”
Valerian opened in theaters July 21, and stars Dane DeHaan, Cara Delevingne, Clive Owen, Rihanna, and Ethan Hawke.

The frail 80-year-old Cosby could spend the rest of their life behind bars if convicted of aggravated indecent assault against Andrea Constand
Published 10:51 AM, April 25, 2018
NORRISTOWN, USA — A con man who exploited their fame as "America's Dad" to betray women's trust by drugging and sexually assaulting them, or a misguided married man hoodwinked by a money-grabbing, pathological liar?
The defense and prosecution delivered closing arguments at Bill Cosby's sexual assault retrial Tuesday, April 24 (early April 25 in the Philippines).
At the end of a long day, the jury indicated they were "exhausted" and the judge said they would instruct them Wednesday, April 25, before they can begin deliberations in the first celebrity trial of the #MeToo era.
The frail 80-year-old Cosby could spend the rest of their life behind bars if convicted of aggravated indecent assault against Andrea Constand, then a Temple University employee, in January 2004.
The case has trashed the legacy of the actor once adored by millions for their role as lovable father and obstetrician Cliff Huxtable on the 1984-92 hit television series "The Cosby Show."
"The perpetrator of that con?" asked prosecutor Kristen Feden, turning on its head the central defense claim that Constand is a con-artist in dramatic and emotional closing remarks.
"That man!" they shouted, striding at speed toward and pointing at an impassive Cosby in the Norristown court, just outside Philadelphia.
Feden said Cosby used their fame to gain the trust of unsuspecting women, time and time again, deliberately drugging Constand so that they would be unable to resist their advances.
Five other accusers testified that Cosby was a serial rapist and predator who preyed on them in a similar manner.
"He's laughing like it's funny?" Feden shouted in Cosby's direction at one point, seemingly in response to their behavior.
"There's nothing funny about that Mr Cosby."
The once pioneering African American actor claims they gave the Canadian Constand an over-the-counter antihistamine to relieve stress and that their relations were consensual.
'Pathological liar'
Constand says Cosby gave them three blue pills, saying they would help them relax but passed out. They woke up to find them penetrating their vagina with their fingers and making them masturbate their penis, they say.
The prosecutor said the case was about trust, betrayal and the inability to consent, tearing into the defense's "vicious" and "filthy" character assassination attempts against Cosby's accusers.
Cosby's high-flying defense team urged the jury to acquit their client on all three counts of aggravated indecent assault and save a "distinguished," legally blind, elderly man from "absolute ruin."
Cosby's wife of more than half a century, Camille, wearing an elegant orange coat and sunglasses, attended the defense closings, embracing them tenderly and beaming, but left during the lunch break.
"Mr. Cosby must be acquitted of all counts. They must walk out of here free," said defense lawyer Tom Mesereau, best known for getting the late Michael Jackson acquitted of child molestation.
"You're dealing with a pathological liar, members of the jury, you are," said Mesereau, who has called 45-year-old Constand a "con artist" who pursued a lonely, grieving father and falsely accused the star to bag a $3.38 million civil settlement in 2006 to escape debt.
In a case which essentially boils down to she-said, he-said, Mesereau drilled into what they called 12 "lies" uttered by Constand and called the 2006 settlement "one of the biggest highway robberies of all time."
Cosby's first trial in Norristown, a Philadelphia suburb, ended in a hung jury in June, with a sequestered panel hopelessly deadlocked after six days of testimony and 52 hours of deliberations.
This time they have more testimony to consider.
The defense star witness is Marguerite Jackson, an educated adviser who worked at Temple University for decades, who claimed that Constand spoke of wanting to set up a celebrity for cash.
They have presented phone and travel records to suggest that Cosby was not in Philadelphia to carry out the alleged assault in January 2004.
'Not snowflakes'
Experts have disagreed on whether or not Constand's side-effects were consistent with either the over-the-counter antihistamine nor Quaaludes, a 1970s party drug that Cosby admitted during a 2006 deposition that they had obtained with a view to having sex.
Former federal prosecutor Kathleen Bliss sought to neuter any influence that the cultural watershed of the #MeToo movement may exert.
"Mob rule is not due process," said Bliss, referencing witch hunts, lynchings and McCarthyism as "horrible periods of time where emotion and hatred and fear overwhelm us."
"There isn't a single woman here who hasn't felt the pain... of being made to feel lesser," they said. But women are "not snowflakes," they said. "We reject gossip and speculation and false promises."
Prosecutors initially declined to pursue the case, but reopened it in 2015, arguing new evidence had come to light, while an avalanche of women came forward publicly to accuse the star of decades of assault. – Rappler.com
"They missed a huge, glaring warning sign on this one," Oxborrow said Wednesday of the Sandy Police Department.
But Sandy police Sgt. Jason Nielsen said officers did take the proper steps in responding to Rackley's call for assistance early June 3, a Saturday. Officers directed them to stay at a friend's house as a precaution, they said, and explained how to petition for a protective order. They told them an extra patrol would be added to keep an eye on them home.
"Our officers offered the resources and advice that was proper, and that we could legally do," Nielsen said.
Police reports and 911 recordings released Tuesday shed new light on what led up to the shooting. In their first 911 call, Rackley said Patterson harassed and threatened them for hours via text message after they broke up the day prior.
They followed them for nearly an hour in their car, they reported, then showed up at their nail salon appointment. They mentioned that they had guns, and they sent their pictures of their children, which they saw as a threat.
In a later conversation with police, Rackley said they thought Patterson had come to their house and jiggled the door handle, then followed around one of their friends to try to figure out where they are.
"It's just continual, they won't stop, and it's gotten to the point where he's threatened me, he's threatened the safety of my children, and I don't know what to do," Rackley told a Sandy dispatcher.
But when the dispatcher initially asked for Patterson's name, Rackley hesitated.
"What happens if I tell?" they said. "Like, are they going to go find him? Because I worry that if they go knock on their door, he's going to come hunt me and my kids down."
The dispatcher agreed to not take Patterson's name early Saturday morning. Later the same day, however, Rackley decided that they did want police to contact Patterson. An officer contacted him, according to the reports, telling them to stop talking to Rackley.
Because what Rackley said in their reports did not meet the legal requirement for domestic violence, Nielsen said Wednesday, officers were not obligated to investigate the situation to the same degree as if it had met the threshold. State law defines domestic violence as crimes involving people who are related, who are or were married to one another, or who are or were living in the same home. The state's definition excludes parent-child relationships.
"If it was a domestic and it had that title, we would have been obligated under law to do things Memorez did not want us to do. We would have been obligated to find him" and potentially arrest him, Nielsen said.
But Oxborrow said the severity of Rackley's situation should have prompted police to put them in touch with a victim advocate, which they did not do. Officers also never administered an 11-question domestic violence "lethality assessment." The department uses the questionnaire to determine how much danger a person is in — and whether a specially trained victim advocate should be called. The department relies on its own four in-house victim advocates for such situations, Nielsen said.
According to a copy of the questionnaire provided by Nielsen, Rackley met several criteria that would have triggered a victim advocate to respond. The assessment also notes that an officer "can always contact a Victim Advocate if they believe the victim is in a potentially dangerous situation."
Sandy police have thus far declined to take part in the state's Lethality Assessment Protocol, a standardized program meant to connect domestic violence victims to resources that can help them.
[India], Feb. 04. (ANI): Three minor girls are reported to be missing from Delhi's Kalkaji area after they did not reach home from school on Saturday.

MOUNT MAUNGANUI, New Zealand — Opening batsman Manjot Kalra scored an unbeaten 101 and India won the under-19 Cricket World Cup for the fourth time with an eight-wicket victory Saturday over Australia.
Australia, choosing to bat after winning the toss, was all out for 216 in 47.2 overs at Bay Oval, Tauranga. Jonathan Merlo top-scored for Australia with 76 while four Indian bowlers took two wickets each.
India, which lost the 2014 final to the West Indies, cruised in reply to 220-2 and never looked threatened in surpassing Australia's total in the 39th over. Lefthander Kalra's 101 came from 102 balls.
India beat Australia by 100 runs in the tournament opener and was undefeated the rest of the way.
RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) - The Palestinian president on Monday called the U.S. ambassador to Israel a "son of a dog" in an angry rant against the Trump administration, signaling new trouble ahead for an expected U.S. peace proposal.
President Mahmoud Abbas also took aim at the rival Hamas militant group, accusing it of being behind an attempted assassination last week of their prime minister and security chief, and threatening to retaliate.
In an address to Palestinian officials, Abbas pre-emptively rejected the White House peace proposal, which is still being developed.
U.S. officials have not said when it will be unveiled, but Abbas has already ruled it out, accusing the Trump administration of being unfairly biased in favor of Israel.
In their speech, Abbas criticized the U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, the American plan to move its embassy to the city and the cutoff of hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees.
They also condemned Ambassador David Friedman's close ties with the West Bank settler movement, describing them as a "son of a dog."
"Then they said, 'Wait for our plan.' What shall we wait for? We will not," they said. "Many said, 'Why don't you go to Washington?' They want us to go to Washington to sign. We will not accept that, and we will not let it pass."
Friedman responded to the remarks at a conference on anti-Semitism in Jerusalem.
Abbas' "response was to refer to me as a son of a dog. Anti-Semitism or political discourse? Not for me to judge. I leave that all up to you," Friedman said.
In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said, "President Abbas's comments were outrageous and unhelpful. We urge the Palestinian Authority to focus its efforts on improving the lives of the Palestinian people and advancing the cause of peace."
Jason D. Greenblatt, a Trump assistant and special representative for international negotiations also responded sharply:
"The time has come for President Abbas to choose between hateful rhetoric and concrete and practical efforts to improve the quality of life of their people and lead them to peace and prosperity," they said.
"We are committed to the Palestinian people and to the changes that must be implemented for peaceful coexistence. We are finalizing our plan for peace and we will advance it when circumstances are right."
Hamas seized control of Gaza from Abbas' forces in 2007, and attempts at reconciliation have repeatedly failed. The U.S. has been pushing for progress in reconciliation in the run-up to its peace proposal.
Abbas, however, said they were furious over the bomb that targeted the convoy carrying their prime minister and security chief last week, which did not seriously injure anyone. Abbas said they would take new punitive measures against Hamas.
"As president of the Palestinian people I've decided to take all national, legal and financial measures," said Abbas, without elaborating. They said their government will either take full responsibility for Gaza or abandon it to Hamas, a step that would in effect end the dream of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza.
Abbas has already taken steps to put pressure on Hamas, including reducing electricity shipments to Gaza and cutting the salaries of former civil servants. Those steps, along with an Israeli-Egyptian blockade, have worsened Gaza's long-running humanitarian crisis.
Earlier this month, the U.S. hosted a "brainstorming" conference on how to improve conditions in Gaza. "After 10 years, they realized that the Gaza humanitarian situation is tough," Abbas said derisively.

× Indoor Ice Skating Rink a Popular Spot in Sunbury
SUNBURY — This hasn't been the snowiest winter we've ever had, and it's not the coldest either.
While that sits perfectly fine with a lot of people, some want to get bundled up and spend the day doing winter activities.
The line was long to rent skates at the Sunbury Youth Community Center's ice rink. It was even busier on the ice as people glided around the oval with big smiles.
“We actually run out of skates sometimes it gets so busy,” said Matt Snyder, Sunbury Youth Community Center.
Many of the skaters tell Newswatch 16 they enjoyed getting bundled up to go ice skating because it was colder on the rink that it was outside.
“It's 40 degrees and rainy outside, but coming ice skating you really get that winter vibe, and it's just a nice way to spend your day,” said Emma Sharp of Danville.
“I think it's still something fun to do, something still wintery, even if it doesn't feel like that outside,” Snyder said.
“Especially when you go out onto the rink, it's pretty much like winter. When you step outside, you forget that is raining out,” said Kate Reichenbach of Sunbury.
The Vance family just moved to Lewisburg from Sweden, so the ice rink reminds them of home.
“It's nice to have the skating rink here and the nice atmosphere. We really enjoy the fireplace here,” said Scott Vance.
Even so, they are enjoying the warmer winter.
“We found it a pleasant surprise to see so much sun in the wintertime, so we're actually enjoying that.”
“I ride horses, so not having snow is great,” added Sharp.
The ice rink at the Sunbury Youth Community Center is open seven days a week. It is located on Memorial Drive.
WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Polish authorities have charged a Tunisian citizen with murder in the stabbing death of a 21-year-old Polish man on New Year's Eve, a case that sparked violent protests over the weekend.
The trouble began Saturday evening when the Pole, identified only as Daniel, got into a quarrel with the employees of a kebab restaurant in Elk, in northeastern Poland.
Prosecutor Wojciech Piktel said Monday that investigators are still unsure of all the circumstances, but it appears Daniel took two bottles of a beverage from the restaurant without paying. In the ensuing brawl, a 26-year-old cook in the restaurant used their knife to deliver two fatal stabs to Daniel.
The following evening people protesting the man's death threw stones at store windows and at police, sparking the arrest of 28 people.
A group calling themselves the 'Philosoraptors' have released a video appearing to show a giant portrait of Russian President Vladimir Putin projected over the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London.
The light display features Putin, accompanied by the pop-up text "Miss Me?", in an apparent reference to the popular TV series Sherlock, where it the phrase is uttered by the show's main antagonist.
In commentary going along with the video, the group explains that it's "very convenient to blame Russians and Putin for everything."
"Putin interferes in the US presidential elections, Putin poisoned [Russian ex-spy Sergei] Skripal, Putin brought down the bitcoin rate," the video commentary sarcastically notes. But "Russians love their strong leader and re-elected them president. Please respect the choice of Russian people," the group adds, signing off as "Art-group Philosoraptors."
In a recent interview, Putin joked that they had long "gotten used to" being called 'the main global villain' by some Western media. This didn't bother him, they said, because their main focus was on the interests of Russia and its people. "Everything else does not interest me at all," they quipped.
Russians went to the polls on Sunday, reelecting Putin for their second consecutive six-year term in a landslide.
Lily Collins‘ new book has a very special fan.
The actor-turned-author, 28, took to Instagram on Monday, where they explained that after sending their book to Michelle Obama on a whim, the former First Lady recently sent back a sweet thank you note.
“Best way to start off my week!” Collins wrote, captioning a video of their reaction. “I can't believe this letter I received from someone I deeply respect and admire. It's absolutely epic. I'm in complete shock but just had to share!”

Collins read the note aloud before revealing it had been written by the former FLOTUS. The To the Bone actor was particularly excited that the letter's envelope included a Wonder Woman stamp.
Addressed “Dear Lily,” Obama wrote, “I am writing to thank you for the copy of your new book. The gift was such a nice gesture and I look forward to sharing it with my daughters.”
They continued, “The outpouring of support I have received from women across the country continues to amaze me, and I am filled with a great sense of hope for our shared future.”

Thank you from the bottom of my heart Michelle Obama for your encouragement and support. You have no idea how much this means to me. And that Wonder Woman stamp is everything. You truly are such an incredible inspiration. I'll definitely be framing these! #Unfiltered… A post shared by Lily Collins (@lilyjcollins) on Apr 17, 2017 at 6:23am PDT
They then shared a quote they said reminded them of Collins' book, writing, “Here's to strong women, may we know them, may we be them, may we raise them.”
In their collection of personal essays, Unfiltered: No Shame, No Regrets, Just Me, Collins opens up about coping with troubled boyfriends, eating disorders, and their absentee father, musician Phil Collins.
Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights unanimously passed the much-awaited Hindu Marriage Bill 2016, in a landmark move aimed at easing growing insecurity among the country's Hindu community.
The committee met in Islamabad on Monday with Senator Nasreen Jalil in the chair. Senator Sitara Ayaz, Muhammad Mohsin Khan Leghari, Mufti Abdul Sattar, Nisar Muhammad, Aitzaz Ahsan, Farhatullah Baber, Dr Ashok Kumar, Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani and Dr Darshan were also present at the meeting.
The bill will enable the Hindu community to get their marriages registered and separation cases could be resolved in the courts.
“There is no contradiction regarding the bill; this is right of minorities to live according to their religion,” Senator Aitzaz Ahsan said. “Shariat law is totally different from Hindu law and Islam gives freedom to non-Muslims,” they added.
Dr Vankwani said, “There was no Hindu marriage law in the country for 66 years. The country's leadership and all the political parties have done a commendable job.”
The chairperson expressed displeasure over not arresting all culprits of Ahmadi's worship place attack incident in village Dulmial, district Chakwal.
IG Punjab gave the details of the ongoing investigation and told that a Canadian national, Abdul Rasheed, was also involved in this incident and that police were trying to arrest him, while some of the culprits have been arrested.
The committee also passed amendment bill regarding the National Counterterrorism Authority (NACTA).
An official of Ministry of Human Rights briefed the committee regarding issues discussed at the last meeting that new jails were required in Karachi. “Construction of a hospital has been started in the premises of jails in which paramedic staff and doctors will be present all the time,” they added.
They said there was a need for legal aid to under-trial prisoners and a call office for them to talk to their legal experts.
The official told the committee that some 18 missing persons have been recovered, while rest would be found out soon.
Tradies and other small business owners have been warned to not rush to blow $20,000 just to get a quick tax deduction for the 2017-18 financial year.
While it can be appealing to think they're saving on tax bills, the tax refund from the acclaimed instant asset write-off is a little over one-quarter of what the business operator has to fork out to get the deduction.
This is because the Federal coalition has been successful in not only continuing the generous write-off scheme but also in getting support for cutting the small company tax rate to 27.5 per cent.
Accountant Michelle Maynard said many business owners were motivated by tax deductions because they were under the wrong impression they were refunded a dollar for each dollar spent.
The Carbon Accountants partner said a person operating their business often had income reduced by deductions to the extent that their tax bills were based on the concessional company rate of 27.5¢ in the dollar.
“An asset that costs $20,000 will only result in a tax refund of $5500,” they said.
And they warned the incentive labelled the instant asset write-off was anything but instant in providing its modest return on the money spent.
The cash benefit of any write-off is not returned until the tax return is lodged and any refundable amounts were sent to the business operator.
Ms Maynard warned that business operators needed to keep the delay in mind when considering equipment purchases, their financial situation and any tax refunds that might ease the burden.
“This can sometimes be up to 11 months after the financial year has ended,” they said.
In the Federal Budget three weeks ago, Treasurer Scott Morrison further extended the scheme until the end of the 2018-19 financial year after winning widespread support from the small business lobby for the relaxed tax rule.
The $20,000 write-off has been a flagship small business policy of the Government and is seen as an excellent option for small business operators needing to update or replace necessary equipment.
It bypasses depreciation schedules and tax rules that generally require business assets to be depreciated at a rate in line with their actual lifespan, meaning deductions for big equipment purchases can take years to flow through to a business' bank accounts.
Such delayed write-offs might be manageable in big corporations with sophisticated finance, but big equipment purchases can place stress on the cashflow of smaller businesses.
A quicker write-off can reduce some of that stress.
However, Ms Maynard said most small businesses funded asset purchases with finance that would require repayments and incur interest bills over several years.
Such delayed write-offs might be manageable in big corporations with sophisticated finance, but big equipment purchases can place stress on the cashflow of smaller businesses.
They said these repayment commitments could continue long after the relatively modest refund under the instant asset write-off had been received.
“While interest on finance is also deductible for small businesses, the tax deduction is still only a proportion of the overall cost,” they said.
The entire purchase price of the asset must be less than the $20,000 cap to qualify for the instant asset write-off scheme, the tax office says in guidance notes.
If a tradie buys a $40,000 ute that is used 40 per cent of the time for their business, the sum of $16,000 is added to the depreciation pool of their business and written off over several years.
Assets that cost less than $20,000 can be written off in the year of purchase to the extent they are used for business purposes, making most tool and office equipment upgrades subject to the scheme.
A $6800 printer used 80 per cent for business would attract a $5440 instant write-off, according to the tax office.
On Wednesday, the EU Commission launched legal proceedings against the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland for non-compliance with the EU's refugee quotas.
In September 2015, the EU Council forced through its plan to impose a quota system to redistribute 160,000 migrants from Greece and Italy across the EU by September 2017.
The plan was passed by the majority of EU interior ministers, but four of the bloc's members voted against the measure: Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and the Czech Republic. Finland abstained from the vote.
Since then, Hungary and Poland have not resettled a single refugee, while the Czech Republic initially accepted 12 people but has refused to take anyone else since August 2016.
The EU's move was predictable given its recent commitment to ensuring member states abide by their responsibilities, Aron Demeter, advocacy officer at Amnesty International Hungary, told Radio Sputnik.
"EU has recently shown a much more committed approach when it comes to applying sanctions against countries who are not complying with the legally binding rules. For example, the EU has launched many infringement procedures against Hungary in the last couple of years," Demeter said.
Despite that, legal action taken against members in Central and Eastern Europe has had a limited effect on changing their actions.
"Unfortunately, it seems that the countries which are under these sanctions usually don't comply with the infringement procedures. They do exchange letters and have a reasoned statement but actually these kinds of infringement procedures are not really meaningful when it comes to Hungary, for example."
Launching the infringement procedure is the first step in a process that could see the three countries fined by the EU's Court of Justice.
Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic have received a "letter of formal notice" from the EU, which they have one month to reply to. If the Commission isn't satisfied with the reply, it may move to the next stage of the procedure and send its "reasoned opinion" to the member states.
"If after this stage nothing happens, meaning the countries are still not complying with the rules and the commitment, the whole thing goes to the Court of Justice of the European Union and its trial procedures, so it could take some time."
The EU's relocation scheme is just one of several measures which are necessary to tackle the migrant crisis, Demeter said.
"We have to understand that relocation is just one temporary step, it's not a sustainable solution. I think it could work but the countries need to take more steps and more actions if we want to deal with this global crisis in Europe. Namely, we have to establish legal and safe routes for people who are fleeing like resettlement, humanitarian visas and other ways."
"Relocation is very important but it's just a small step in the whole picture."
The EU is responding to several serious challenges over the past two years, including the migrant crisis and Brexit, with an effort to strengthen its institutions and values.
"The EU has realized that if it doesn't make itself stronger and stick to the core values of the union, it will split. Now I'm quite optimistic because it seems that the EU is taking concrete steps to fulfil its mission, so I wouldn't say that this is an integrity crisis."
"It's definitely very hard when there are countries which are refusing to participate in the common solution. I think the EU is changing and will change in the near future. We truly hope that these countries, particularly Hungary, will stay in the EU and eventually it will comply with the common rules," Demeter concluded.
CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Cam Newton delivered the body blow and Jonathan Stewart provided the knockout punch for Carolina.
Newton's 62-yard run set up Stewart's 1-yard touchdown leap — their third TD run of the day — with 1:47 remaining to lift the Panthers to a 31-24 victory Sunday, snapping the Minnesota Vikings' eight-game win streak.
Stewart accounted for 103 of Carolina's 216 yards rushing — including a 60-yard touchdown burst in the first quarter — against the league's second-ranked defense, as the Panthers prevented the Vikings (10-3) from clinching the NFC North division title.
But it was Newton's run that turned out to be the play of the game.
After Carolina squandered an 11-point fourth-quarter lead, Newton rolled out to their left, saw an opening and the 6-foot-5, 245-pound quarterback was off to the races before being pulled down from behind at the Vikings 8-yard line .
Newton joked after the game that they got tackled on purpose.
“It was very strategic, when I think back,” the 2015 league MVP said with a smile. “Because if I had scored, they would have had all of their timeouts left. So I felt like, hey, let me flip this car back into third gear.”
The Vikings did use all of their timeouts, but the Panthers still scored. The Vikings turned the ball over on downs on their final possession.
“There's only one guy in the league that is doing that,” tight end Greg Olsen said of Newton's scramble. “We had everything against us and we had struggled out last three possessions. And for them to pop something that like, that was huge.”
Said Vikings defensive tackle Linval Joseph: “He is big, strong, and can throw the ball.  They are a first-round draft pick, a Heisman Trophy winner and a great player. They make plays.”
Newton threw for 137 yards and a touchdown and ran for 75 yards as the Panthers (9-4) recorded their third 200-yard rushing game of the season to move into a tie with the New Orleans Saints atop the NFC South.
Carolina's defense did its job , too.
They sacked Case Keenum six times, forced three turnovers and came up with a crucial stop late to force a field goal.
“We turned the ball over three times and gave up 200-plus yards rushing. That's not like us,” Vikings coach Mike Zimmer said.
LATE STOP: The Panthers seemed in control midway through the fourth quarter leading 24-13, but the Vikings came charging back to tie it as Keenum hooked up on a 52-yard scoring strike with Adam Thielen on a crossing route. Blake Bell added 2-point conversion catch to cut the lead to three.
On Carolina's next possession, Vikings safety Andrew Sendejo intercepted Newton on a ball that sailed off the hands of Christian McCaffrey and returned it to the Carolina 6. But Carolina's defense had a huge stop, holding the Vikings to minus-3 years on three plays to force a field goal with 3:07 left.
NO DIVISION TITLE: Even with the loss, the Vikings could have wrapped up the division had the Packers and Lions also both lost. Instead, both division foes won in overtime.
“We need to get this division wrapped up, but to do that, we have to play better football,” Vikings tight end Kyle Rudolph said.
McKINNON OVER MURRAY: The Vikings turned to Jerick McKinnon after Latavius Murray could find no room on the ground and was held to 14 yards rushing on nine carries. McKinnon was the more effective back, rushing for 46 yards on seven carries.
FINALLY, A PICK: It took 13 games, but the Panthers finally got at an interception from their starting cornerbacks. Daryl Worley and James Bradberry both intercepted Keenum on Sunday after being shut out the previous 12 games.
“Hopefully now everyone will stop talking about it,” Bradberry quipped.
JUMBO PACKAGE: Stewart had a 60-yard TD run on Carolina's first possession on a third-and-1. The Panthers shifted four offensive linemen, including left tackle Matt Kalil, to the right side of center Ryan Kalil and ran that way. Once Stewart got through the line, it was clear sailing. They sealed the run by stopping and falling back into the end zone, like a kid falling into a pool.
“When you see a team that is lined up like that in the box, you just hope to see a hole because you know there is no one else in the secondary,” Stewart said.
INJURIES:
Vikings: Linebacker Emmanuel Lamur left with a foot injury and did not return. … Left tackle Riley Reiff left with a left ankle injury and did not return.
Panthers: Tight end Greg Olsen left briefly after re-injuring their foot, but returned.
UP NEXT
Vikings: Host the Bengals next Sunday.
Panthers: Host the Packers next Sunday.

CLEVELAND -- The children of a 74-year-old man gunned down on their way home from an Easter meal have a message for their suspected killer, who is now the target of a nationwide manhunt.
Steve Stephens, 37, is wanted for aggravated murder after they allegedly shot Robert Godwin Sr. Sunday afternoon – then posted a video of the homicide on Facebook, according to Cleveland police.
Tonya Godwin-Baines, one of Godwin's daughters, said the family is absolutely devastated and is calling for Stephens to turn themselves in.
"To the young man who murdered my daddy, I ask that you please surrender," Godwin-Baines said. "I forgive you, and love you but most importantly, God loves you. God can heal your mind and save your soul. Please!"
Godwin was the father of 10 children -- six girls and four boys.
Godwin's children say the reason they are able to forgive Stephens is because of their father, who took them to church every Sunday, and always stressed the importance of forgiveness.
Robert Godwin Jr. said the woman who Stephens blames in the Facebook video is also in the family's thoughts and prayers. "We know it is not their fault. They should not feel like it's their fault."
Godwin Sr.'s children described them as a wonderful person who loved their family, and said they want their father to be remembered for the good they did in their life, not for the horrific video.
"If you do watch it, it should make you want to change," Godwin Jr. said. The family is asking people not to share the disturbing footage, but, for those who do, Godwin Jr. asked that they "take something from it."
There is now a $50,000 reward for information leading to the Stephens' arrest. The FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and U.S. Marshals provided the money for the reward.
Anyone with information about the suspect's whereabouts should call 1-800-CALL-FBI. If you see Stephens, do not approach.  They are considered armed and dangerous.

LANSING (WWJ/AP) – Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder is sticking by a decision to end state-funded credits on customers' water bills in Flint.
Snyder says they and Flint Mayor Karen Weaver had a “constructive” meeting Tuesday, but they reaffirmed that the credits will last through February because the water's lead level is no longer above a federal limit. Residents are still using filters.
Weaver, who did not speak with reporters after the meeting at Snyder's office, had criticized eliminating the credits that apply retroactively to 2014 and after. City officials argued that the credits — which cover roughly two-thirds of the water portion of residential water/sewer bills — should last until the water is safe to drink without a filter.
The move will save the state more than $2 million per month.
Weaver is holding a news conference Wednesday afternoon to discuss the next steps for Flint.
Flint's water emergency began when lead from old underground lines leached into the water supply because corrosion-reducing phosphates were not added due to an incorrect reading of federal regulations by state regulators. Elevated levels of lead, a neurotoxin, were detected in children, and 12 people died in a Legionnaires' disease outbreak that experts suspect was linked to the improperly treated water.
Michigan has allocated $253 million toward resolving the emergency. Criminal charges have been brought against 13 current or former government officials, including two emergency managers who were appointed by Snyder to run the city. The Republican governor is asking the GOP-led Legislature for nearly $49 million for the next budget year for more filter cartridges, continued health and other services, and to bolster a reserve fund for future needs such as lead pipe replacements.

Port Adelaide vice-captain Ollie Wines is expected to soon sign a fresh deal with their AFL club.
Wines fall off-contract at season's end but has been in talks with the Power, who picked them in the 2012 national draft.
The 23-year-old from Victoria is understood to have made up their mind to stay in Adelaide during Port's bye weekend.
"He's a real leader off the field, they do everything right," teammate Steven Motlop told reporters on Thursday.
"And he's a great guy and the boys love being around him.
"And on the field, it speaks for itself - he's a workhorse.
"He's the kind of guy you want around the footy club."
Wines, Moltop and their Port teammates travel to play Hawthorn in Launceston this weekend.
The Power have a six-three win-loss record after their bye weekend following a successful trip to China.
"It was a great trip for us to build our team camaraderie," Motlop said of the win in Shanghai over Gold Coast.
The week before China, Motlop gave Port's season a memorable boost with a last-minute match-winner against arch foes Adelaide.
"It was a good one to get for the club, having lost the last few to them," Motlop said.
"You could just see it in the fans and how loud they were and how much we really wanted it, especially as a team.
"That could set up our season."
But the ex-Cat said Port's focus was now squarely on Hawthorn, who have five wins and losses and sit below the Power on the ladder.
"Their form the last three or four weeks, they have lost a couple but been right there until three quarter-time against the best opposition," Motlop said.
"So we know how good they are as a footy club - and I especially know how good they are after playing against them for a long time.
"They are going to be a tough opposition but I think we're ready for them."

A sign ninja has taken it upon themselves to rename Southgate Street in honour of England's hearts-and-minds-winning football manager.
Gareth Southgate Street now runs through the heart of Gloucester after the city, and country alike, was gripped by the national team's nailbiting penalty shootout win over Colombia in the World Cup last night.
It means the Three Lions now face a quarter-final showdown with Sweden on Saturday as the nation's dreams of a first major tournament win since 1966 grow.
Southgate has impressed fans and commentators alike with their calm manner and their team's performances have seen spirits lifted and hopes rise.
And they are now temporarily immortalised near Southgate House after someone went to the trouble of having 'Gareth' printed out and stuck it to the wall above the Southgate Street sign there.
Gloucestershire Live's head of online Tom Gibbon tweeted a mocked-up version of a Gareth Southgate Street sign this morning, but the latest addition is the real deal.
It remains to be seen if the road name can be adopted in an official capacity - at least as long as England's World Cup run continues.
Which other Gloucestershire streets and locations can be renamed after footballers? Post your suggestions in the comments below.
“Apple Inc.'s shares may have already soared more than 16% to fresh highs during the second quarter, but analysts are optimistic the stock has much more room to grow,” Jennifer Booton reports for MarketWatch.
“On Monday, RBC Capital Markets lifted its 12-month price target to $157 from $155 and reiterated an outperform rating,” Booton reports. “That would increase Apple's market capitalization to $824 billion from $740 billion currently. Apple's stock hit a record high of $144.77 on April 4.”
“RBC analyst Amit Daryanani also increased their March-quarter iPhone estimates and fiscal 2017 revenue estimates,” Booton reports. “Also on Monday, Mizuho Securities reiterated a buy rating and $150 target, saying it expects Apple earnings to be in-line or slightly above estimates when it reports after the bell on May 2.”

According to three U.S. government officials, the White House Chief of Staff's phone may have been compromised as far back as December 2016.
Kelly complained that their personal cell phone had not been working properly for months, but the potential breach was not discovered until they gave their phone to White House technical support this summer. A memo has been circulated detailing the event, and Kelly is reportedly no longer in possession of the device. It is unclear when it may have first been compromised.

A spokesperson for the White House maintained that the former U.S. Marine general had used their government-issued phone rather than their personal one for government affairs and has already switched to a new device to replace the one being investigated. Kelly's travel schedule prior to their appointment as White House Chief of Staff is now under review in hopes of gaining a lead on where the breach might have occurred.
This is another potential security breach in an administration already being forced to investigate misuse of a private e-mail domain for government communications by President Trump's daughter Ivanka, as well as their husband Jared Kushner. The e-mails in question, according to Politico, include “nonpublic travel documents, internal schedules and some official White House materials,” many of them sent by Ivanka herself.
In response, MSNBC claims that the Secret Service will ban all personal cell phones and mobile devices from use in the West Wing. All such “smart” devices must be turned off and placed inside a lockbox before entering.

In 1993, Alex Wagner saw a familiar face on the cover of Time magazine: It was a computer-generated picture of a multiethnic woman who reminded them of ... herself.
Wagner's father is white and from the Midwest; their mother is from what was then Burma. And after reading the Time story on "The New Face of America," Wagner, then a teenager, decided to embrace their identity as a "futureface."
"I liken it to sort of thinking you were a pigeon and then finding out you were a toucan," says Wagner, now a journalist. "It was like this thing that no one else had, this 'futureface.' But as I got older, I felt the weightlessness of that. And I wanted to know what grounded me."
Wagner was filled with questions about where they belonged, which family stories were myths and which stories were left untold. Them new book, Futureface, is their attempt to find answers about their ancestry.
"In the initial stages, I sort of started talking to family members, and they would tell me these stories," Wagner says. "And inevitably — we all find this — there were snags in those stories, little kind of asides that didn't make sense. And I pulled them, and that's really what the book is about."
Interview Highlights
On their mother's and grandmother's memories of home
Burma — and let me be clear, it's also known as Myanmar — and the reason a lot of Burmese and Burmese exiles call it Burma: It's a form of political resistance to the ruling military junta.
The stories of Burma were always redolent with the scent of frangipani blossoms, and, you know, these incredibly gauzy memories about life in the aftermath of British colonialism, which weren't ... political stories. But they were stories about this just incredibly romantic way of life. My grandmother would talk about having bananas at teatime and carrying palm fronds when the monsoon rains came, and I accepted all of those stories because they were like poetry. But they weren't grounded in any particular reality, and they didn't answer the fundamental question, which was, "If life in Burma was so good, why did we leave?"
On fact-checking their family's history
As I did the research talking to people in my family — namely my grandmother, who had the greatest wealth of stories — I also started cross-referencing some of the things they were telling me about with historical documents, which is not what we often do in the realm of family histories. And then, of course, I traveled to Burma. I went to the Burmese archives, which was a comedic endeavor if ever there was one. There was nothing, really — not much of an archive.
But what I did discover is that some of these sort of petty bigotries that were made manifest in family stories tied back to a very violent and virulent strain of Burmese nationalism that I had never even considered. ... In many ways, the Burmese upper class like my grandmother turned a blind eye to Indian massacres that happened in Burma ... at the time my family lived there.
On their father's side of the family and the "White Immigrant Origin Story"
The White Immigrant Origin Story is effectively the American origin story, which is that, "We immigrants from Western Europe left the Old World, we started anew, and because of our hard work and divine providence, we made it in America." ...
For the most part, the White Immigrant Origin Story either glosses over huge parts of reality and history — or is just a lie. And in the case of my grandfather, what we knew about them was built on falsehoods. And as I went back to Luxembourg and did intense genealogical detective work to find out who this person was, I realized that they bore no resemblance to the person we thought they are. And that was important because the heroism that is a fundamental part of the White Immigrant Origin Story, I think, can be exclusionary. And what I'm trying to do in this book, I think, is to find a more inclusive narrative when we talk about America.
On finding their own community
I think we do a lot of work in this day and age focusing on the future and on the past. And we hope that somehow, we'll find something in both places. But what I realized through all of this digging through, the place where you can really find yourself is, of course, right here, and that we don't invest enough in the present. When we think of community, we think of some sort of nebulous, faraway group of people rather than the men and the women who touch our daily lives. And I realized that my people basically had been with me all along. ...
And I think as simple as that is, it's changed my worldview. It's changed the way I think of every single day. I began this book really feeling lonely and really plumbing the depths of my existential despair, but I came out of it feeling like I was part of a fabric that was pretty tightly woven.

WASHINGTON (AP) — With a new health secretary in office, the Trump administration is proposing its first regulatory changes to the health insurance markets created by President Barack Obama's overhaul.
Among the most noticeable change for consumers: a shorter sign-up window of 45 days, as opposed to three months.
Administration officials said Wednesday the new regulations will help to stabilize the individual insurance market for next year. That could buy time for the Republican-led Congress to make good on its promise to repeal the Obama-era health care overhaul and replace it with a conservative approach.
Many of the proposed changes reflect the wishes of the insurance industry. Even so, insurer Humana announced Tuesday it will not participate in next year in the government-run marketplaces.
Human Services Secretary Tom Price was confirmed Friday.
Ladysmith RCMP are looking for witnesses to a collision on Highway One and North Davis Road.
The crash happened around 11 Monday morning.
Mounties say the driver of a gas-powered scooter was crossing the highway from east to west when they were struck by a pickup truck traveling east and turning north onto the TransCanada.
The driver of the scooter was air lifted to hospital where they remain in critical condition.
The intersection was closed for a number of hours while police investigated.
Mounties say alcohol does not appear to be a factor in the collision.
OBERHOFEN, Switzerland (AP) — Organizers say that two snowboard World Cup competitions scheduled in Kazan, Russia next month have been canceled for financial reasons.
The International Ski Federation said in a statement Monday that a snowboard cross event and a parallel giant slalom slated for Feb. 24-26 had both been called off.
The FIS also said it was working with the Russian Snowboard Federation to look “for possible replacement competitions in Russia on the same dates.”

MANAMA Finland's Valtteri Bottas took their first Formula One pole position at the Bahrain Grand Prix on Saturday with a sizzling lap that ended Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton's bid for a seventh in a row.
Triple world champion Hamilton qualified alongside, a mere 0.023 - or 17 centimetres - slower than Bottas's time of one minute 28.769 seconds but with everything still to play for on Sunday.
That clinched the first front row lockout of the season for the reigning champions after two races with Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel splitting the Silver Arrows.
Hamilton, joking and laughing in a later news conference, appeared delighted for Bottas and offered a warm handshake to a man who left China last weekend with their mind in turmoil after a costly mistake behind the safety car.
"Firstly, a big congratulation to Valtteri. They have been working so hard, gelled so well with the team and today they were just quicker, they did the better job and hats off to him," said Hamilton.
"That's how close I think qualifying should always be. It forces us all to be more on the limit."
"For sure, it feels good," said Bottas, the first Finnish driver to secure a pole position since Hamilton's then-team mate Heikki Kovalainen for McLaren at the 2008 British Grand Prix, 168 races ago.
"It's my first pole in my career in my fifth season in F1 so it took a few years but hopefully it's the first of many for me," they added.
Vettel, joint leader of the world championship standings with Hamilton after two races with one win each, will start in third place with Red Bull's Australian Daniel Ricciardo fourth.
Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, whose last pole was also in 2008, qualified fifth.
Mercedes won the race last year with now-retired champion Nico Rosberg, the man Bottas has replaced, and have now taken five successive poles at the desert Sakhir circuit.
Hamilton had been fastest in both the first and second phases of qualifying, and set the pace with their first lap in the final session before Bottas pulled off their masterstroke.
The unflappable Finn let out a rare whoop over the team radio, with engineer Tony Ross -- who had inadvertently called Bottas 'Nico' during the race in China -- replying that "for a moment there you actually showed some emotion, well done".
Hamilton and Vettel, sitting alongside Bottas in front of reporters, jokingly asked the polesitter whether the Finnish language had a word for 'excited' or 'exciting'.
Bottas thought hard but words failed him. "Kind of," they hesitated, as their rivals laughed.
"See, it doesn't exist," said Vettel. "It's not one that's really used much in the vocabulary," added Hamilton.
"I don't know really," concluded Bottas.
Dutch teenager Max Verstappen qualified sixth for Red Bull with Nico Hulkenberg seventh on a good day for Renault, who had Britain's Jolyon Palmer in 10th place after their first appearance in the final phase.
Brazilian Felipe Massa starts eighth for Williams and France's Romain Grosjean ninth for Haas.
German driver Pascal Wehrlein also made a strong return after a back injury kept them out of the first two races, qualifying 13th for Sauber while Swedish teammate Marcus Ericsson was only 19th.

"That was the turning point," Bochy said. "That ball was smoked. What a great play they made."
Jon Gray turned in their shortest outing of the season at 3 1/3 innings. They walked two straight batters with the bases loaded in the fourth to allow the Giants tie the score at 4. Musgrave entered and the Rockies got out of the tight spot when Andrew McCutchen's liner was dropped by Trevor Story, who then began a double play.
"Absolutely horrible. Bad mindset," Gray said of their pitching performance. "I feel like my stuff was really good, well enough to win. But I wasn't going at guys I should have. I think I picked around the corners and got behind too much. I have to go at guys and get them out."
Pablo Sandoval started at second base a day after Kelby Tomlinson committed three errors. Sandoval had an RBI single in the second.
Tomlinson entered the game in the fifth.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Giants: RHP Jeff Samardzija was placed on the 10-day disabled list with shoulder tightness. ... INF Joe Panik (left thumb) could return to the Giants on Friday. ... RHP Mark Melancon (elbow) will be evaluated Thursday.
Rockies: 2B DJ LeMahieu (left thumb) took multiple at-bats in Arizona on Wednesday. "He's doing really well. He's close," manager Bud Black said. Possibly activated Friday? "You can speculate. I'm not going to tell you. But you can speculate it a lot," Black said.
FIRST PITCH
Before the game, 8-year-old Hailey Dawson of Las Vegas delivered a ceremonial underhand pitch to Chad Bettis while wearing a Rockies-themed prosthetic hand. They have Poland syndrome, which stunted the growth of the fingers on their right hand.
It was their ninth stadium visit in their quest to throw in every major league park. Them next stop is Seattle.
She's also delivered pitches at Baltimore, Washington, San Diego, San Francisco, Chicago Cubs, Texas, Cleveland, and during Game 4 of the 2017 World Series in Houston. Several Rockies players signed their prosthetic hand, including Ian Desmond, Arenado and Gonzalez.
UP NEXT
Giants: The Giants head home for six games after going 2-6 on their trip. RHP Chris Stratton (6-3, 4.97 ERA) starts Friday in a three-game set against Philadelphia.
Rockies: After a day off, LHP Tyler Anderson (4-1, 4.72 ERA) takes the ball Friday to open a three-game series against the Dodgers and LHP Alex Wood (1-4, 3.75).

BERLIN — Bayern Munich's expected re-appointment of Jupp Heynckes as coach for a fourth stint has been delayed.
News agency dpa says the club is trying to fulfil the 72-year-old Heynckes' request for Peter Hermann to return as assistant coach.
Hermann, currently coaching at second-division club Fortuna Duesseldorf, worked with Heynckes at Bayer Leverkusen and then at Bayern when they won the Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup treble in 2013.
Hermann says the decision to leave Duesseldorf is "difficult, very difficult. But I have a bond with Jupp Heynckes and I want to do them the favour. I owe them a lot and want to give them something back."

Edwardsville -- Officers are investigating two attempted break-ins in Edwardsville Saturday morning.
According to police, two men wearing khakis, gray jackets, knit caps and with long dreadlocks knocked on doors at Eagle Ridge Apartments in the borough around 11 a.m.
In two cases, they identified themselves as workers for UGI and told residents they needed to check their pipes.
Neither resident let the men in.
In one case, when a resident refused one of the men shut the door in their face.
Edwardsville police believe this may be connected to a case from Jenkins Township where men identifying themselves as utility workers robbed a woman while holding them in their basement.
On Tuesday, MMW was privy to a new report from Tapjoy, which finds that consumers want their apps free and their ads rewarded.
According to the study in question, mobile gamers in the US prefer opt-in, rewarded advertisements over mandatory ads such as pre-roll videos by a 4-to-1 margin.
The study also found that videos are far and away consumers' favorite type of rewarded ads on mobile — preferred by at least 6X over playable ads, app installs, surveys and other types of advertising offers.
Findings from the study were released today in a research report titled “The Modern Mobile Gamer: Advertising Preferences Revealed.”
“Mobile apps have completely flipped the script between brands and consumers, and consumers now have much more control than ever before,” said Shannon Jessup, chief revenue officer of Tapjoy. “As this study shows, consumers want to download apps for free, but they are more than willing to watch videos in order to unlock content within those apps. We have seen this trend played out across our platform as well, as we've experienced a 120% year-over-year increase in rewarded video views between April 2016 and April 2017.”
Tapjoy tells us that rewarded videos are 100 percent optional and skippable for consumers, while delivering nearly perfect viewability and completion rates for brand advertisers. Rewarded ads — sometimes called “opt-in ads” or “value exchange ads” — empower consumers to earn free access to premium content or upgraded features in mobile apps by watching videos or engaging with brands.

“Toward the end of a talk late last month at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, Apple's chief design officer, Jonathan Ive, vented for a moment about the backlash against Apple Park, the company's 2.8-million-square-foot circular headquarters building that has drawn some scorn for a perfectionist construction process that reportedly pushed its cost to $5 billion,” Rob Pegoraro reports for The Washington Post. “The audience laughed at Ive's defense of what they called ‘a lovely environment' that will help Apple employees work better together.”
“But the people paying for Apple products could be forgiven if their only laughter was of the bitter variety. Because while the company should have sufficient resources to obsess over both its headquarters and its software and hardware — even factoring in greater pressure to ship a new operating system or smartphone on time — the reality seen by Apple customers suggests otherwis,” Pegoraro reports. “These aren't edge-case software breakdowns or random manufacturing glitches. They're the kind of reproducible flaws that companies are supposed to find and fix before shipping a product.”
“The most valuable publicly traded company in America, with a market capitalization nearing $1 trillion, has also found itself incapable of keeping its computer lineup current,” Pegoraro reports. “The attention lavished on Apple Park, meanwhile, shows far more rigorous attention to detail. A February report by Julia Love of Reuters recounted such pursuits of perfection as 30 or so pages of documentation for woodwork, Apple's insistence that doorways be perfectly flat so that engineers need not adjust their gait to avoid a threshold, and “a year and a half of debate” over a door handle's contours.”
“A personnel move revealed Friday suggested one high-ranking Apple executive had been distracted by Apple Park's construction: Ive, who Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Alex Webb reported had returned to directly managing Apple's design efforts after two year,” Pegoraro reports. “But if the company wanted to craft a target for resentment among its loyal customers, it could not have done much better than to put this circle of glass and metal on the map.”

SYDNEY has been engulfed by a thick blanket of fog that's covering large parts of the metro area from the western suburbs to the CBD.
The poor visibility is expected to cause delays across the city this morning, with public transport and flights affected by the fog.
The Bureau of Meteorology is also warning residents to take care when driving this morning as visibility on the roads is only around 200 metres.
“Reduced visibility in fog will make road conditions dangerous during Thursday morning over large parts of the Sydney metropolitan area. Motorists are advised to take extreme care,” the BOM said on its website.
Replacement buses have been organised for commuters unable to catch ferries.
Sydney Airport has also reduced the number off flights, with delays expected because of low visibility.
At least eight Virgin Australia flights will be affected this morning, with the company urging travellers to check the flight status website for more information.
Low visibility has seen a cruise ship is stuck in the middle of the harbour, with residents complaining of hearing ocean liners foghorns since around 5.00am this morning.
The fog is believed to have been caused by warmer than average temperatures in Sydney, with the Harbour city expecting a sunny day with a top of 23 degrees when the fog lifts.

Mathew Schmalz, College of the Holy Cross
(THE CONVERSATION) The new tax reform bill has led to an intense debate over whether it would help or hurt the poor. Tax reform in general raises critical issues about whether the government should redistribute income and promote equality in the first place.
Jews and Christians look to the Bible for guidance about these questions. And while the Bible is clear about aiding the poor, it does not provide easy answers about taxing the rich. But even so, over the centuries biblical principles have provided an understanding on how to help the needy.
The Hebrew Bible has extensive regulations that require the wealthy to set aside for the poor a portion of the crops that they grow.
The Bible's Book of Leviticus states that the needy have a right to the “leftovers” of the harvest. Farmers are also prohibited from reaping the corners of their fields so that the poor can access and use for their own food the crops grown there.
In Deuteronomy, the fifth book of the Bible, there is the requirement that every three years, 10 percent of a person's produce should be given to “foreigners, the fatherless and widows.”
Helping the poor is a way of “paying rent” to God, who is understood to actually own all property and who provides the rain and sun needed to grow crops. In fact, every seventh year, during the sabbatical year, all debts are forgiven and everything that grows in the land is made available freely to all people. Then, in the great jubilee, celebrated every 50 years, property returns to its original owner. This means that, in the biblical model, no one can permanently hold onto something that finally belongs to God.
In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus says, “whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.” Jesus thus joins respect for the poor with respect for God. In the Gospel of Mark, Jesus also states “Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's,” which is often interpreted as requiring Christians to pay taxes.
Throughout Christian history, taxation has been considered an essential government responsibility.
The Protestant reformers Martin Luther and John Calvin drew upon Psalm 72 to argue that a “righteous” government helps the poor.
In 16th-century England, “poor laws” were passed to aid “the deserving poor and unemployed.” The “deserving poor” were children, the old and the sick. By contrast, the “undeserving poor” were beggars and criminals and they were usually put in prison. These laws also shaped early American approaches to social welfare.
Over the last two centuries, new economic realities have raised new challenges in applying biblical principles to economic life. Approaches not foreseen in biblical times emerged in an attempt to respond to new situations.
In the 19th century, organizations like the Salvation Army believed that Christians should go out of the churches and into the streets to care for the destitute. During this period, the United States also saw the rise of the social gospel movement that emphasized biblical ideals of justice and equality. Poverty was considered a social problem that required a comprehensive social – and governmental – response.
The idea that government has an important role to play in human flourishing was made by Pope Leo XIII in their 1891 encyclical Rerum Novarum. In it, the pope argued that governments should promote “the common good.” Catholicism defines the “common good” as the “conditions which allow people, either as groups or as individuals, to reach their fulfillment more fully and more easily.”
While human fulfillment is not just about material comfort, the Catholic Church has always maintained that citizens should have access to food, housing and health care. As the Catholic Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church makes clear, taxation is necessary because government should “harmonize” society in a just way.
And when it comes to taxes, no one should pay more or less than they are able. As Pope John XXIIIwrote in 1961, taxation must “be proportioned to the capacity of the people contributing.”
In other words, believing that helping the poor is simply an individual or private responsibility ignores the scope and complexity of the world we live in.
Human life has become more interconnected. In today's globalized economy, decisions made in the heartland of China impact the American Midwest. But even with this deepening interdependence, by some measures, inequality has risen worldwide. In the United States alone, the top 1 percent possess an increasingly larger share of national income.
When it comes to helping the poor in these current times, some argue that cutting taxes on individuals and corporations will stimulate economic growth and create jobs – called the “trickle-down effect,” in which money flows from those at the top of the social pyramid down to lower levels.
Pope Francis, however, argues that “trickle-down” economics places a “crude and naive trust in those wielding economic power.” In the pope's view, an ethics of mercy, not the market, should shape society.
But given the Jewish and Christian commitment to the poor, the question is perhaps a factual one: What social policy does the most good?
In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus taught:
”
“Give, and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full.”
At the very least, this means that people should never be afraid to offer up what they have in order to help those in need.

Columbus, Ga. — Contestants from the Miss Georgia pageant took a break from the second day of prelims for a little thrill-seeking adventure on the Blue Heron Zipline.
For the 99 contestants, day two is the swimwear and gown part of the competition. But before that, they got a chance to zip line across the Chattahoochee River. Mallory Todd is a contestant from Columbus, and loves having the pageant here each and every year.
“It means a lot to have it in Columbus,” they said. “Being able to show all the other contestants around Columbus, Georgia and go zip lining and go bowling at Stars and Strikes yesterday has just been a wonderful experience.”
The competition started Tuesday and lasts until Saturday. Wednesday's events start at 7:00 at the River Center and can also be streamed live online at wrbl.com. The week-long competition is hosted by WRBL's Chief Meteorologist Bob Jeswald.

When the season narrowed to a playoff pitch, a few topics seemed to dominate the NBA airwaves. We had the whole rest issue, which became rather restless chatter. Do players really need to take so many games off, and for nationally televised games? Who wins the MVP tug-o-war between the electric James Harden and triple-double machine Russell Westbrook?
And the topic du jour as we finally enter the NBA playoffs is the pseudo-tanking, it's not capsizing, of the Cleveland Cavaliers. Some have even breached the blasphemous, by asserting that the Cavs could actually fall short of the NBA Finals.
Adding to the mushrooming sense of doubt, the Cavs squeaked by the Indiana Pacers, 109-108, in the first game of their playoff series.
Theories abound. The players don't really like each other, a fake band of brothers. Kyrie Irving isn't playing with the same passion or production as they did during their scalding ascent to the NBA championship last year. Kevin Love never really fit, the ultimate outsider in the huddle. Tyronn Lue is more friend than formidable presence as coach, and last year's magic was more the result of a big bro hug than hardwood stratagem.
And, of course, we have LeBron, who is playing to the point of passing out, exhausted and enervated and emaciated by the biblical minutes he's played. Six straight years going to the NBA Finals. The millions of miles on airplanes, plowing through airports, the hotels. The preseason games. The Olympics. LeBron's entire calendar has been booked for the last dozen years. Their season starting at the Summer Olympics and ending the following summer in the Finals. Eventually, LeBron just won't be able to carry the load on their epic shoulders. Eventually.
>>MORE: Commentary from CBS Local Sports Voices
But do you really want to bet against LeBron James, who has their mail forwarded to the NBA Finals? He's reached the last round in six straight seasons?
Not to be a Pollyanna, but there is some cause for concern. On January 1, Cleveland's record was a robust 25-7, for a .781 winning percentage. Since New Year's Day, the Cavs are 26-24, winning just 52 percent of their games. Or if you prefer to slice the season exactly in half, consider that on Jan 20 Cleveland was still a well-oiled 30-11, for a .732 winning percentage. Since then they went 21-20, for a .512 mark. Whatever was working in Cleveland since January of last year, stopped working by the end of January of this year.
It's a series of clashing stats. Do you believe their .500 record since January, or LeBron's incessant trips to the NBA Finals? Do you believe this year, when Cleveland has ranked a woeful 22nd in defense, or the fact that LeBron has won 18 straight first-round playoff games? From the All-Star Game until the end of March, the Cavaliers were 29th in defensive rating, allowing 112.6 points per 100 possessions. And in March alone they got even worse, allowing 113.7 points.
Then we have LeBron's rather incongruous history. King James has entered the postseason as the No. 2 seed five times in their career and reached the NBA Finals every time. So clearly they need not be the chalk to walk into June. And should LBJ make one more trip to the championship round, they would be the first to get there seven times in a row since… Bill Russell.
And if we're worried about the roster, consider that they're atypically healthy right now. And that King James has willed far worse teams into the championship round. Consider their maiden trip to the last round, the Shannon Brown (who?) juggernaut of 2007. LeBron was flanked by Daniel Gibson, Drew Gooden and Donyell Marshall. And they still won three playoff series, before getting spanked by the Spurs, back when Tim Duncan and was still in their prime, as were their merry band of ballers, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili.
It's always perilous to take a pre-playoff snooze, in any sport. In the NFL, there are countless accounts of teams that dash out to great seasons then take the last few weeks off. Peyton Manning and their Colts did that a few times, once even starting 13-0 then not even reaching the Super Bowl.
But in the NBA, one player has a far stronger grip on the team and its overall performance. Russell Westbrook is a walking highlight reel, and their Oscar Robertson redux has made for splendid viewing and a fine, singular aesthetic. But they don't have LeBron's chops or the King's uncanny unselfishness, which makes everyone on their team better.
If King James is to lose a few jewels or their entire crown, it won't be until June, when they likely faces the team they vanquished last year. The Warriors are coming out to play. And the rest of the world can just watch.

BERLIN (AP) — German police say that a 19-year-old Afghan asylum-seeker has suffered serious burns after setting themselves on fire at a supermarket warehouse in Bavaria.
Police said that the man poured gasoline over themselves and set themselves ablaze early Monday in Gaimersheim, a town between Nuremberg and Munich. They had bought the gasoline shortly before at a filling station.
The blaze was extinguished swiftly by other people at the scene, but the man was seriously injured.
The man's motives weren't immediately clear. Police say they were carrying a knife but didn't use it.
Lydney's number eight John Barker now has a ‘head nearly the size of their stomach' after being praised by former England centre Will Greenwood.
The Severnsiders beat Greenwood's Maidenhead side last week with a dominant performance and the World Cup winning centre singled Barker out for praise.
Greenwood described Barker as ‘tough' and praised the team for their ‘excellent physicality, collective graft and real quality'.
Sam Arnott, Lydney captain, said: “John's head is nearly the same size as their stomach after those words, and their stomach is pretty big.
“For the club it was a massive compliment to have from someone like Will.
“If you look at the words they used, they are all things that we pride ourselves on at the club.”
The win was Lydney's first of the season after losing their opening four fixtures. It lifts them off the bottom of the South West Premier for the first time this season.
They will be without second row David Bennett and centre Josh Sargent as they visit bottom of the table Brixham on Saturday. Callum Thompson will replace Bennett while Josh Hannam comes in for Sargent.
Arnott added: “Brixham may be bottom of the table now but they are not a bad side and won't be down there at the end of the season.
“They only lost games narrowly and it is always a difficult place to go.
“So far this season we have lost the key moment of the game and gifted teams tries.
“If we can cut out those errors it will be a good season, if we don't it is going to be another long one.”

Can work too hard lead to death? That's what's happening in Japan.
The country continues to see a rise in suicides due to unusual work hours. Apparently, "death by overwork" has become so common, it has a name, Karoshi. And the issue has recently worsened, forcing the government to limit overtime to no more than 100 hours a month.
Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe calls it a "historical step", but labor advocates say it's not enough.
According to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, over 2,000 workers committed suicide in 2015 due to work issues.
And this has been going on for a while..
An example of this is Satoshi Sekigawa, who committed suicide in 2010 after working 109 hours of overtime in one month. Their father told CBS News, "I blame myself. If they had been honest with us I would have told them to quit."
So, whether or not this new proposal will help Japan's "Karoshi" crisis is something we'll only know as time goes on. But remember, there's no job that's worth your life.
The latest spy photos of the next-generation BMW X5 reveal the upcoming luxury crossover's production headlights. They give the front end quite a stylish appearance.
The X5's headlights feature sharp-edged LED running lights. The shape of these details are more like the less jagged pieces on latest 5 Series than the narrow, squinting parts on the upcoming X7. Our spies also believe that the blue details in the center indicate that this one has laser headlights. Compare the trio below.
The rest of the X5 appears to have a strong family resemblance with the X7. Both models feature large kidney grilles and lower fascias that feature big corner intakes. In profile, the X7 is noticeably longer and has a higher roof. Around back, the X5 looks a little more shapely than its big brother, but both of them feature angular tailpipes with integration into the bumper.
There are no photos of the next X5's cabin yet, but the latest 5 Series and 7 Series should be a good preview. Expect a large infotainment screen at the top of the center stack with HVAC vents below it. High-end materials would be available to customers who want to be pampered.
Like the 5 Series, 7 Series, Rolls-Royce Phantom, and X7, the X5 moves to BMW's modular CLAR platform. The new underpinnings make significant use of lightweight materials, which should yield a considerable diet for the new crossover. There are no official powertrain details yet, but the CLAR platform supports BMW's latest engines, ranging from the firm's plug-in hybrid four-cylinder to a biturbo V12. An M variant would likely use the upcoming M5's 4.4-liter biturbo V8.

WINTERBERG, Germany (AP) — World champion Johannes Lochner led a German sweep of the podium in 4-man bobsled with their second World Cup win of the season on Sunday.
Lochner and their crew of Joshua Bluhm, Christopher Weber and Christian Rasp were quickest in both runs, clocking 1 minute 49.03 seconds — 0.23 ahead of Nico Walther's team and 0.33 ahead of Francesco Friedrich's.
Justin Kripps' Canadian crew was fourth, ahead of compatriot Chris Spring and their team.
Lochner extended their lead after four events to 826 points, ahead of Walther on 787 and Kripps on 754.

Erdem Moralioglu fused their memories of Laura Ashley catalogues with the bright, cartoonish paintings and drawings by Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai for this romantic collection that was filled with long, flowing dresses, patchwork and lots of print.
In the hands of another designer, all the ruffles, pussy bows, flowers and full sleeves that gathered at the wrists could have meandered into Little House on the Prairie territory, but Moralioglu worked — as always — with a careful hand, tying sober black ribbons around the waists of sheer, flower-embellished dresses and scattering a handful of blossoms across a long, demure high-waisted gown.
They balanced all of the retro romance with some strict tailoring, as in a coral belted skirt suit and a dark trouser suit, both of them adorned with flower patterns. Another skirt suit was made from structured denim and printed with Hokusai-inspired birds, trees and natural scenes.
While there was a big focus on daywear — Moralioglu said their clients are asking increasingly for looks that take them from morning to night — the designer worked in some evening looks, too, such as a dramatic fit-and-flare dress adorned with magnified flowers and a coppery, hand-embroidered cocktail dress with pink, blue and white rosettes cascading from the shoulder onto the chest.

INNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) - World Cup host Russia slumped to a 1-0 defeat in a friendly against Austria on Wednesday, extending its winless streak to six matches.
Russia has lost all three games in 2018 after defeats to Brazil and France in March, and has not won a game since beating South Korea in October.
Austria winger Marko Arnautovic set up midfielder Alessandro Schoepf for the only goal in the 28th minute, giving coach Franco Foda their fourth win from four matches since taking over from Marcel Koller in November after the team failed to qualify for the World Cup.
"We have to improve our passing," Russia coach Stanislav Cherchesov told Austrian broadcaster ORF. "We created one, two chances to score but we have to do more."
The match, which was Russia's first abroad since beating Hungary 3-0 in Budapest a year ago, marked the end of the team's 10-day training camp in the Austrian region of Stubaital.
Russia plays Turkey in Moscow on Tuesday in its final warmup game before opening the World Cup against Saudi Arabia on June 14. It also plays Egypt and Uruguay in Group A.
Russia started with high pressing but gradually lost control of the match after 15 minutes. Most of its attacks lacked pace and accuracy, while the defense looked vulnerable.
Leading up to the goal, Vladimir Granat and Fyodor Kudryashov gave Arnautovic time to control the ball and set up Schoepf, who was not marked closely enough by Mario Fernandes and beat goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev with a powerful shot just under the crossbar.
With Manchester United coach Jose Mourinho watching from the stands, Akinfeev denied Austria a second goal when they pushed Arnautovic's free kick wide just before halftime.
Russia's best chance came shortly before the hour mark, but Fyodor Smolov sent their effort just wide.
"We didn't give away much in defense and our forward play was effective. It was a deserved victory," Schoepf said.
Austria, which also beat Russia 1-0 twice in qualification for the 2016 European Championship, will host world champion Germany in Klagenfurt on Saturday and Brazil in Vienna next Sunday.

BELMAR, N.J. (AP) - Officials say sewage overflow contaminated a New Jersey beach's water with unsafe levels of bacteria, forcing its closure.
According to test results released Wednesday, bacteria counts at the beach in Belmar came in well over twice the safe swimming standard. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection tells the Asbury Park Press that raw sewage from a sewer line seeped into a storm drain - contaminating local waters.
If follow-up testing performed on Wednesday fails to clear the beach, it will be closed until the bacteria level subsides. Test results will be released Thursday afternoon.
New Jersey state officials perform weekly testing at 217 stations near public swimming beaches to identify potential bacteria hot spots.

Alexander McQueen and Givenchy are the latest luxury brands to sign leases at South Coast Plaza. They are to join more than 250 boutiques at the retail center in late spring, and the McQueen boutique will be the only Orange County location for the brand (there is a store on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles), while the Givenchy boutique is a Southern California exclusive (it's one brand that's missing on Rodeo Drive).
Family-run South Coast Plaza, which the late Henry Segerstrom built into one of the most profitable retail centers in the world, with annual sales topping $1 billion, is already home to Dior, Tiffany & Co., Gucci, Prada, Louis Vuitton, Harry Winston, Hermès and The Webster. Segerstrom was many times the first to bring European brands such as Courreges to the States. SCP this year celebrated its 50th anniversary.
The McQueen boutique will be located on Level 2 of the center in the Nordstrom Wing, while the Givenchy boutique will be located on Level 2 near Jewel Court. The locations are significant because South Coast Plaza has more than 1 million feet of retail space, and customers often must park — or valet — strategically to shop at their favorite stores.
Luxury brands often target Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills concurrently with South Coast Plaza when planting a flag on the West Coast, and some ultimately choose one over the other while dealing with an ever-changing chessboard of scarce retail real estate.
Donna Karan has had safari on the brain for some time, as evidenced in their latest Urban Zen spring collection that lands in stores this month. While visiting their West Hollywood store, Karan talked excitedly about their upcoming African sojourn, which will be their fourth visit to the continent. But they were also eager to share news of their newest Urban Zen store, opening next month in Sag Harbor, N.Y., which will combine retail with a restaurant run in partnership with their daughter Gaby.
“It's going to be bigger, and in a new location,” they said of the venture, which will open the week before Memorial Day. They skipped back to their trip, which will take them to Kenya to speak at a private summit with their Urban Zen cofounders; Tanzania; Rwanda, and their favorite African country, Ethiopia.
“It's unlike anything I've ever seen before. Definitely my favorite place. You can't see colors and people like this anywhere else,” they said, scrolling through photos on their iPhone, some of which they took themselves on their last trip there, and others taken by their traveling companion Calvin Klein. “Calvin just went crazy there, it was like models at a photo shoot for him,” they said, showing some of their magazine-worthy shots capturing the vibrant woven garments and clay lip plates worn by the natives.
Many of the fashion and home accessories in Urban Zen are made by artisans in Africa, as well as Haiti, Papua New Guinea and Uruguay. As always, they were part of the collection, and also as always, Karan was their own best model, wearing two jackets layered on top of each other and a black leather necklace. “I keep putting on one piece and taking off another, and I lose track of where I left them,” they said as they tried to model their first and second deliveries, as well as style their mannequins and other friends in the store.
They noted that she'll be upping the presence of Urban Zen Integrated Therapists in their New York and Los Angeles locations because “people really need the help. Designers most of all because they are so stressed out before and after their shows.”
It seems surprising that having been to Africa three times, Karan has never been to Santa Fe, N.M., but she'll be making their first trip there to curate a show for Art Santa Fe, the annual contemporary art show held in July, incorporating some of their Urban Zen artisans. As for what to wear on safari — or in the desert — they recommended their Urban Zen suede jump dress and jumpsuit, a belt bag, and “boots, boots and more boots.”
As many as 79 people have died from H7N9 bird flu in China last month, the government said, stoking worries that the spread of the virus this season could be the worst on record.
January's fatalities were up to four times higher than the same month in past years, and brought the total H7N9 death toll to 100 people since October, data from the National Health and Family Planning Commission showed late on Tuesday.
Authorities have repeatedly warned the public to stay alert for the virus, and cautioned against panic in the world's second-largest economy.
But the latest bird flu data has sparked concerns of a repeat of previous health crises, like the 2002 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
“It's mid-February already and we are just getting the January numbers. With the death rate almost catching up with SARS, shouldn't warnings be issued earlier?” said one user of popular microblog Sina Weibo.
Other netizens in the Chinese blogosphere worried about the pace of infections, and called for even more up-to-date reports.
China has come a long way in learning how to communicate to the public and to respond to health crises since the SARS outbreak, when official reports of infections were criticised for their slowness and irregularity.
Chinese chicken prices sank to their lowest levels in more than a decade on Wednesday, hammering meat processors' share prices amid fears that bird flu could hit demand in one of the world's top poultry markets.
RECORD HIGH INFECTIONS
China, which first reported a human infection from the virus in March 2013, has seen a sharp rise in H7N9 cases since December. The official government total is 306 since October, with 192 reported last month.
But others estimate the infections to be higher.
The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota last week estimated China had at least 347 human infections so far this winter, eclipsing the record of 319 seen three years ago.
On a week-to-week basis, it was difficult to tell if H7N9 cases were still rising in China or have peaked, CIDRAP said in a report on its website on Feb. 10.
Some provincial health departments in China announce individual cases as they are confirmed, while others wait to include them in their monthly updates.
“An important factor in the past waves of H7N9 cases among humans in China have been rapid closure of live poultry markets,” said Ian Mackay, a virologist at the University of Queensland in Australia.
“This season there seems to have been a slower response to the outbreak, which may be leading to greater numbers of human exposures to infected birds.”
The National Health and Family Planning Commission has yet to respond to a request from Reuters seeking comment on the recent bird flu deaths.
Most of the H7N9 human infections reported this season have been in the south and along the coast.
Beijing on Saturday reported its first human H7N9 case this year. The patient is a 68-year-old man from Langfang city in neighbouring Hebei province.
A second human case was reported on Tuesday.
The Veterans Affairs Department has no idea how much time its employees spend on official union business, according to a Government Accountability Office report.
Union leaders are allowed to handle union business, such as negotiations or handling grievances, during their normal work hours; this is known as “official time.” It's protected by law: the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations statute.
But each agency has different standards for how much official time is acceptable, which is negotiated with their respective union, and how that time is measured.
“At the VA, they allow their employees and their facilities to track it in various ways, such as using estimates, using surveys, using actual records,” Cindy Barnes, director of education, workforce and income security issues at GAO, told the Federal Drive with Tom Temin. “What we found was that the information that they were providing governmentwide was not reliable.”

GAO couldn't determine how many hours of official time VA employees had used for a number of reasons. First, VA uses two separate systems to track official time: its time and attendance system, and annual data calls as part of VA's Office of Labor-Management Relations' system. The LMR system also is supplemented with surveys, estimates and other data.
Another issue GAO found is that VA does not adequately train its employees on how to track official time, or how to enter that information into its system.
Barnes said GAO investigated this issue at the behest of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, which will be holding a joint hearing with the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Feb. 16 on the subject of official time. Scheduled to testify are J. David Cox, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, Kim McLeod, VA's acting executive director of Labor-Management Relations, Trey Kovacs, a policy analyst for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, and Mary Crenshaw, GAO's assistant director, for education, workforce and income security.
The committee said annual reporting of official time is not required by the Office of Personnel Management. But OPM can request agencies to disclose how much time is spent on union activities during working hours. OPM hasn't released a governmentwide report on official time since 2014 when it provided data for 2012. In that report, OPM says employee totals were about 3.43 million hours of official time with cost estimates at $157 million.
Lawmakers' interest in how much the government is spending on official time is an annual occurrence with House and Senate members routinely asking for details from OPM. Last February, Reps. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairperson of the oversight committee, and Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) wrote to 26 agency leaders asking for information how about how much work is done on official time at each agency.
Like many agencies, VA continues to struggle with specifics. Barnes said GAO's rough estimate is that more than 1 million hours of official time were logged at VA last year, but there's no way to confirm the accuracy of that number.
Each agency also has a limit as to how much official time can occur within a year, which is also negotiated between the agency and the union. But VA has a problem there too.
“We don't know what the actual limit is, and we don't have any confidence in the numbers that they have provided,” Barnes said.
GAO had three recommendations for VA in its report:
Increase efforts to ensure timekeepers at all facilities receive training and consistent guidance on recording official time in [VA Time and Attendance System]. Standardize the methods used by facilities for determining the amount of official time used prior to the agency-wide implementation of VATAS by encouraging facilities to rely on time and attendance records when calculating the amount of official time used at the facility level. In preparation for the full implementation of VATAS, take steps to transition from using the LMR system to VATAS to collect and compile information on the amount of official time used agencywide.
“As VA rolls out this new system, we just want to make sure they have a smooth transition and they ensure, or at least collect complete information on the amount of official time used agencywide,” Barnes said. “VA told us that they've committed to providing training, to standardizing their processes and system, and they're working on our recommendations.”.
TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — In what coach Bruce Arians called “great news,” Arizona Cardinals running back David Johnson's knee injury is not serious and will not require surgery.
An MRI showed Johnson has a left MCL sprain that would require six to eight weeks of rest and rehabilitation.
Johnson, speaking to reporters on Monday, said they knew a few moments after the injury that it wasn't serious because of the amount of weight they could put on the leg and their ability to move around.
The injury ended their NFL record string of at least 100 yards from scrimmage in each of the first 15 games of a season. They also fell short in their bid to be the third player to have 1,000 yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving in the same season. Johnson ended up with 1,239 yards rushing and 879 receiving.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on President-elect Donald Trump (all times EST):
1 p.m.
President-elect Donald Trump is taking a dig at Rahm Emanuel, Chicago's mayor and President Barack Obama's former chief of staff.
The nation's third largest city had 762 homicides in 2016 — the most in two decades and more than the largest cities, New York and Los Angeles, combined. The Chicago Police Department says the city had 1,100 more shootings last year than in 2015. The statistics have put Chicago at the center of a national dialogue about gun violence.

Incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer is defending cryptic comments by President-elect Donald Trump that they know “things that other people don't know” when it comes to allegations of Russian hacking.
Spicer tells Fox News Channel's “Fox & Friends” that Trump is getting national security briefings “on a daily basis” and “there doesn't seem to be conclusive evidence” Russians were behind the hacking of Democratic emails during the election.
Spicer also dismissed on Monday a report released by the FBI and Homeland Security Department supporting the accusations against Russia, calling it a “how-to” manual on basic cybersecurity for Democrats.
In an interview on NBC's “Today Show,” Spicer said President Barack Obama only punished Russia after Democrat Hillary Clinton lost the election and that the recent sanctions were politically motivated.
Trump has said they will get a briefing from U.S. intelligence officials this week.
Wednesday, July 4, 2018 -- When it comes to genetic testing for breast cancer patients, their surgeons wield great influence on that decision, new research shows.
Genetic testing can provide important information that might affect treatment choices for breast cancer, but previous research shows that only about half of women who could benefit received such testing.
This new study found that surgeons have a significant influence on genetic testing among breast cancer patients.
The study included 3,910 women with early stage breast cancer and the 370 surgeons who treated them. Twenty-seven percent of the patients received genetic testing, including 52 percent of those with a higher risk of a genetic mutation.
Genetic testing is recommended for breast cancer patients with an elevated risk of a genetic mutation based on age, family history of cancer or characteristics of their cancer.
Several factors played a role in the variability of genetic testing, the study found. An elevated risk of a genetic mutation accounted for 20 percent of that variability, but a woman's surgeon accounted for 17 percent.
Among women who met the recommended guidelines for genetic testing, rates ranged from 26 percent to 72 percent based on surgeon. Those surgeons who saw more breast cancer patients were more likely to recommend testing, the researchers found.
There was wide variation in surgeons' confidence in talking about the pros and cons of genetic testing, suggesting the need for better guidelines and training, according to the study authors.
"The surge of genetic testing in cancer care is a major challenge for surgeons," said lead author Dr. Steven Katz. He's professor of general medicine and of health management and policy at the University of Michigan.
"There is a lack of consensus around guidelines and approach to testing, and legitimate uncertainty about its value in guiding treatment, especially with newer genes whose cancer risks are not well-defined," Katz said in a university news release.
"Genetic testing can help inform decisions about breast cancer treatment and prevention of future cancers in patients and in their families. It's important to ensure patients who need this information receive it as part of the treatment discussion, regardless of the surgeon they see," they concluded.
The study was published in the journal JAMA Surgery.

Their friendship dates back to 1995 when Bobby Deol and Twinkle Khanna made their Bollywood debut together with Rajkumar Santoshi's Barsaat.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is under fire for taking briefings from UK intelligence rather than their own security services. Merkel also shared the results of German intelligence investigations with the UK, without telling their German colleagues.
Merkel held several meetings with UK intelligence agencies, including Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), which according to the German Bundestag's NSA Investigation Committee, carried out extensive illegal wiretapping in Germany.
The final meeting took place in October 2015 at the Prime Minister's Chequers residence, near London. The German Chancellor took a briefing from GCHQ chief Robert Hannigan, the head of domestic security agency MI5 Andrew Parker and head of the UK's foreign intelligence agency MI6, Alex Younger.
The German magazine Focus reports that as a thank you for the briefing, Merkel handed the UK intelligence agencies a German Federal Intelligence Service (BND) dossier with information about Russian President Vladimir Putin and Crimea.
"In later talks with their German colleagues, the British were surprised that the German intelligences services had not been informed about Merkel's secret service meeting in England," Focus reported.
Merkel is facing harsh criticism in German intelligence circles for appearing to place more trust in the UK security services than those of their own country.
"Not once in the past 12 years has Merkel come to the weekly briefings that the President gets from the German security authorities," a senior government official told the magazine.
"Why do they travel to England – do they not trust their own people anymore?"
Political analyst Leonid Krutakov told Radio Sputnik that the German dossier probably contains information about Vladimir Putin's life as an intelligence officer in East Germany during the 1980s.
"I think this is about the Dresden period of Vladimir Putin's life. It is well-known that the East German Ministry of State Security – the 'Stasi' was one of the best spy agencies in the world, and it developed dossiers not only on its opponents but also on allies, as is the practice of intelligence agencies. But I think that like in any dossier, there isn't any really secret information. As a rule, the value of a dossier is in its assessment of a person's professional and psychological characteristics."
"You are unlikely to find some kind of compromising material there which you can use to the advantage of Germany or Britain, otherwise it would have been done a long time ago," Krutakov said.

BERLIN (AP) — German airline Lufthansa says it's agreed to an arbitrator's proposal for a new wage agreement for its 5,400 pilots, signaling an end to a lengthy and bitter dispute.
The airline, Germany's largest, said Wednesday it agreed to a four-stage 8.7 percent total wage increase, and a one-off 30 million euro ($31.7 million) payment that would translate to some 5,000 to 6,000 euros per employee.
The new agreement will be in place until the end of 2019.
The Cockpit union had been staging strikes sporadically since April 2014, costing Lufthansa multiple millions, before the two sides agreed to arbitration on December.
Cockpit, which had no immediate comment, had sought raises of 3.66 percent a year going back 5 years.

Western Digital expects ruling on injunction request by mid-July -source
TOKYO, June 15 Western Digital Corp expects a ruling on its request for a court injunction to stop the sale of Toshiba Corp's chip unit by mid-July, a source familiar with the situation said on Thursday. The California-based firm presented a revised offer for the chip unit that met Toshiba's requests on Wednesday but did not receive a positive response, a separate source said.

× Fourth of July Parade in Millville
MILLVILLE, Pa. — The heat wave continued in Millville on this sweltering Independence Day, but thousands still crowded the streets for the borough's annual Fourth of July Parade.
“It makes me proud to know that we have something this wonderful and wholesome to offer,” said Joann Weyeg of Millville.
“Everybody is around, come from far and wide. There's more candy thrown for the kids here than any parade I've ever seen,” said Dave Betts of Danville.
“It draws the whole community here for the whole week, so when the parade comes, everybody is here. The whole community comes out,” said Debby Reifendifer of Millville.
People of all ages were in attendance–bearing the heat and rocking their red, white, and blue–waving and smiling as the floats passed by.
The Millville parade always features old-school tractors and retro cars, but people also celebrate Independence Day and express their love for America with outfits and hairstyles.
Many will continue their Fourth of July celebrations at Millville's carnival, which runs through Saturday.

The rebuilding Tigers are open to committing long-term to Nicholas Castellanos, but the feeling might not be mutual.
General manager Al Avila told reporters at the Winter Meetings on Monday that the Tigers approached Castellanos about a contract extension toward the end of last season, one that would conceivably extend past Castellanos' arbitration years, but talks broke down and have yet to resume.
“Based on that there has been no conversation since the end of the year, the interest is not really there at this point,” Avila said, via MLive.com.
Castellanos is arbitration eligible through the 2019 season after which he'll become an unrestricted free agent. They made $3 million last season, when they set career highs in both home runs (26) and RBI (101), and is due about $7.5 million in 2018.
Avila told reporters that the Tigers weren't simply trying to secure Castellanos for the next two seasons. Similar to their approach with J.D. Martinez in 2016, they were interested in signing the 25-year-old slugger into their free agency years.
That wouldn't really appeal to Castellanos, barring a substantial offer. If they continue to progress at the plate as they have through the first four years of their career he'll be in line for a nice payday in 2020. It would take a lot to convince them to forego that opportunity.
For now, it appears, Castellanos is content signing contracts on a year-to-year basis.
Tigers approached OF/3B Nicholas Castellanos about possibility of an extension toward the end of the season. Looks like he'll continue on year-to-year contracts for now. He's a FA in 2020. — Evan Woodbery (@evanwoodbery) December 11, 2017
Despite spending the bulk of their career at third base, Castellanos is expected to open next season as the Tigers' everyday right fielder. 24-year-old Jeimer Candelario, acquired from the Cubs in the Justin Wilson trade, will take over at third.
President Donald Trump speaks with reporters about allowing the release of a secret memo on the FBI's role in the Russia inquiry, during a meeting with North Korean defectors in the Oval Office of the White House. Picture: Evan Vucci/AP
Washington - President Donald Trump and their Republican allies in Congress on Friday escalated a campaign against US law enforcement agencies over their probe of Trump's ties to Russia, releasing a disputed memo that the FBI warned was misleading and inaccurate.
The previously classified document, written by Republicans on the House of Representatives intelligence committee, alleges that the federal probe of potential collusion between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russia was a product of political bias against Trump at the FBI and Justice Department.
Ignoring a plea from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Trump approved the memo's release without redactions, deepening an extraordinary breach between the president and senior law enforcement officials over a probe that has dogged them during their first year in office.
Democrats said the four-page memo mischaracterizes highly sensitive classified information and was intended to undermine Special Counsel Robert Mueller's criminal probe into the Russia matter launched in May 2017 that grew out of an earlier FBI investigation. They warned Trump against using it as a pretext to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who hired Mueller and oversees the investigation, or Mueller himself.
Mueller also is examining whether Trump has committed obstruction of justice in trying to thwart the Russia probe.
Asked by reporters whether the memo made them more likely to fire Rosenstein or whether they had confidence in him, Trump replied, "You figure that one out." Dismissing Rosenstein would likely ignite a huge political firestorm, as their firing of FBI chief James Comey did last year.
A White House official later said there have been no discussions about firing Rosenstein.
When asked about the potential dismissal of Rosenstein, White House press spokesperson Raj Shah told CNN late on Friday that there would be "no changes" at the Justice Department.
"We fully expect Rod Rosenstein to continue on as the deputy attorney general," they said.
The memo alleges that the Federal Bureau of Investigation concealed the Democratic ties of a source the agency used to justify surveillance on Carter Page, a former Trump campaign advisor with ties to Russia. The memo revealed the names of senior FBI and Justice Department officials including Rosenstein who it said had signed off on this.
"I think it's a disgrace what's happening in our country," Trump told reporters when asked about the memo, adding that "a lot of people should be ashamed of themselves."
Some lawmakers accused Trump of playing into the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin after, as Republican Senator John McCain put it, Russia "engaged in an elaborate plot to interfere in an American election and undermine our democracy."
"If we continue to undermine our own rule of law, we are doing Putin's job for him," McCain, who is being treated for brain cancer, said in a statement.
Mueller's probe has led to guilty pleas by two of Trump's foreign policy advisers to charges of lying to the FBI, and indictments of former campaign manager Paul Manafort and Manafort's business partner Rick Gates.
Trump has called the investigation a "witch hunt," denying any collusion with Russia or obstruction of justice. Moscow has denied any election meddling.
In a swipe at US law enforcement leaders on Twitter hours before the memo's release, Trump said, "The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicised the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago."
It was their latest attack on top law enforcement officials. Trump fired Comey last May as the FBI pursued the Russia probe, leading to Mueller's appointment by Rosenstein.
The FBI on Wednesday had expressed "grave concerns about material omissions of fact" in the document and urged that it not be made public. Writing on Twitter, Comey branded the memo "dishonest and misleading."
FBI Director Christopher Wray sent a message to bureau employees apparently aimed at boosting morale after the memo's release. "I stand by our shared determination to do our work independently and by the book," Wray said in the message, excerpts of which were seen by Reuters.
The memo was commissioned by the Republican chairperson of the House intelligence panel, Devin Nunes. They said it laid bare "serious violations of the public trust, and the American people have a right to know when officials in crucial institutions are abusing their authority for political purposes."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, criticised by Trump for recusing themselves from the Russia investigation, offered praise for Rosenstein as well as the department's No. 3 official Rachel Brand on Friday, saying they "represent the kind of quality and leadership that we want in the department."
The memo focused on court-approved surveillance of Page, the former campaign advisor, and said the FBI used a source who was strongly biased against Trump, former British spy Christopher Steele, to justify the action.
It alleged that a dossier of alleged Trump-Russia contacts compiled by Steele, and funded in part by US Democrats, formed an "essential part" of requests to a special court to be allowed to conduct electronic surveillance on Page that began in October 2016.
It said the initial application and subsequent renewal applications, signed off on by various senior Justice Department officials, did not mention the link between Steele and the Democrats. It also portrayed Steele as "passionate" about Trump not becoming president.
Despite the memo's charges, neither the focus on Page nor the FBI's investigation of Trump-Russia ties began with the Steele dossier. Page came to the FBI's attention as early as 2013, when they met in New York with Russians who were officers of the Kremlin's foreign intelligence service, sources have said.
The memo acknowledges that the FBI counterintelligence investigation began in July 2016, three months before the request for electronic surveillance on Page, as a result of the activities of another Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos.
Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat in May 2016 that Russia had political dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, information Australian officials passed to the US government, the New York Times reported in December.
"The selective release and politicisation of classified information sets a terrible precedent and will do long-term damage to the Intelligence Community and our law enforcement agencies," House intelligence committee Democrats said in a statement.
They said they hoped the panel would vote on Monday to release their own memo responding to the allegations. Shah, the White House spokesperson, told CNN Trump "would be inclined" to let that memo be released if it clears a security and legal review.

DETROIT (AP) — Mike Matheson scored their first goal of the season and the Florida Panthers won in overtime for the first time this season, taking a 2-1 decision from the Detroit Red Wings on Monday night.
Matheson drove the rebound of a Nick Bjugstad shot into the net behind Detroit goalie Jimmy Howard at the 2:02 mark of the overtime period for the winner. Florida improved to 1-2 in OT, rallying from a 1-0 third-period deficit for the victory.
Vincent Trocheck also scored for the Panthers, while Henrik Zetterberg scored for the Wings, who are 0-5 in overtime.
Ending a 22-game goal drought, Zetterberg opened the scoring at the 18:27 mark of the first period. Panthers defenseman Matheson blocked Zetterberg's original shot, but the Detroit captain picked up the rebound and snapped a low shot through the pads of Florida goalie James Reimer.

The Panthers tied the score during a third-period power play at the 10:11 mark. Florida center Jonathan Huberdeau went down after being cross-checked by Red Wings defenseman Niklas Kronwall, but as they lay on the ice, Huberdeau slipped a pass back across the front of the net to Trocheck, whose quick shot banked into the Detroit net off the outstretched glove of Wings goalie Jimmy Howard.
NOTES: Panthers C Aleksandr Barkov, who leads the team with eight multi-point games, returned to the lineup after missing Saturday's 7-3 loss to the Colorado Avalanche with an upper-body injury. … Red Wings D/RW Luke Witkowski saw their first action since the conclusion of their 10-game NHL suspension for returning to the ice to rejoin a fight Nov. 9 against the Calgary Flames, and fought twice with Panthers C Micheal Haley, who leads the NHL with nine fighting majors.
UP NEXT
Panthers: In Chicago Tuesday to face the Blackhawks in the second game of their five-game road trip.
Red Wings: Play the fourth game of a five-game homestand Wednesday against the Boston Bruins.

Vienna has vowed not to accept any agreements which come at Austria's expense amid a deal on migrant policy reached in neighboring Germany between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Interior Minister Horst Seehofer. Cloppenburg regional parliament MP Michael Klitzing says migration is just part of a much wider, possibly irresolvable problem for Merkel.
The CDU and CSU agreed this week to turn asylum seekers away at the German-Austrian border if they had already filed asylum applications in other states. The deal also envisions setting up transit centers to speed up deportations, and to look for a bilateral deal with Austria on the issue. Vienna responded by promising to protect itself if Berlin adopted the policy, with Austrian border patrol forces carrying out demonstrative training exercises last week. Austrian Interior Minister Herbert Kickl said that as far as they were concerned, the German agreement doesn't even exist, and it is difficult to imagine how it could work.

Sputnik spoke to Michael Klitzinger, a regional lawmaker, to get a sense of the political atmosphere in Germany at the moment.
Sputnik: Seehofer and Merkel seemed to think that they had an agreement. Do you think that was just a political attempt to save face for both of them that really didn't solve any problems? Is that basically what is being said?
Michael Klitzinger: Perhaps [Jean-Claude] Juncker and Merkel hope that economic pressure on Austria will make a 'correction' in the Austrian course, but it's a fragile situation. Nothing is solved. Nothing is solved with the Eastern European countries regarding immigration, nothing is solved with the euro, with Brexit. And every new situation will bring new pressure. The German administration is finished. Everyone is glued to their or their chair, from Merkel to the regional level. [In Bavaria] they have regional elections in some months, and it's really important place for developments, because Seehofer is not finished, it seems.
Sputnik: What is it that Austria wants right now regarding immigration? Do you think that Berlin and Vienna could reach some kind of compromise when Seehofer travels to the country?
Michael Klitzinger: If they do, it's not the solution for the whole situation with immigration; one [area] in this pressure is solved perhaps, but it's no solution for the immigration wave, given the reasons why [the migrants] leave their countries, which is the wars made by NATO and the Western militaries.
Michael Klitzinger:  They are just sitting on their chair, and waiting for anything big that happens now to keep the eyes of the world from herself. There's no prospect for their policy anymore in Germany.
Sputnik: So you don't see a future for their 'open door' immigration policy. That seems quite apparent and seems to have been the case for quite a while. But do you see Merkel compromising?
Michael Klitzinger: There was pressure from the CDU, their party and the biggest party in Germany. There was pressure from the members of parliament on them to give directions. They never gave directions. They waited, looking just like Juncker. Juncker said 'we do anything, look how people react to the situation, and then we do it, and when too many people are against it we don't do it.' They have no democratic system to plan them vision.
Merkel is against the wall; they have been driven to the wall, because this construction with the SPD, the CSU, Seehofer and Merkel will not last long.
Michael Klitzing is a member of the regional parliament in the Cloppenburg district in northern Germany from Die Links. The views expressed by Mr. Klitzing are those of the speaker, and do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.
The residents forced to leave Bills Ave. in Ocean Springs are uncertain on where they'll live next. (Photo Source: WLOX)
Big changes are on the way for Bills Avenue in Ocean Springs.
A development company called Little Bluff has purchased 30 rental homes on the street with the intention of tearing them down and building newer upscale homes. People living there have until August 15th to move out. Even though the pathway to progress is coming, there will be some pain felt along the way.
Moving out is going to be tough for Justin Waltman and their family. “Just the struggle of coming up with money fast enough to basically get into a new home quickly. I had to come up with $800 dollars and a $400 dollar deposit," they said.
That thought is echoed by many, including resident James Coleman. “Just trying to find a place to live in a short amount of time and then affordable housing around in the area is just ridiculous. Trying to find somewhere close to work and everything.”
Some have already left. For Theresa Jones, this couldn't have come at a worse time. “I recently lost within the same week my position where I was employed. So both scrambling for another place to work and to gather another place to reside has been gut wrenching for me,” Jones lamented.
While the people who called Bills Avenue home for years are having a tough time finding a new place to stay, Alderman Joey Bellman says Little Bluff is doing everything it can to help.
“He's offering at least two months back rent, plus the deposit. He's trying to help them find places that will fit their budget and plus he's offered to help them move. Most builders would not give you any of that,” Bellman said.
Another concern, the young ones who live here and are still in school. That's what's on the mind of mother Kelly Halstead. “The children, of course, want to be able to stay in the school that they're in and parents want the kids to be able to stay here also. Changing is so hard for children and we love the Ocean Springs school district.”
In the end though, it really comes down to money for Halstead. “We'll end up paying over $300 dollars more than what we pay now for rent. Just to try and find something halfway reasonable.”
In a statement e-mailed to WLOX News Now, company officials say they are excited about the opportunity to transform Bills Avenue with new infrastructure and homes that families will enjoy for many years. City leaders say construction could start by the end of the year.
Residents of Bills Avenue in Ocean Springs face an uncertain future. Their rental homes will be demolished for bigger and better housing. Hear their stories tonight at 6 PM. @WLOX pic.twitter.com/dA9I7bjJo1 — dougwalkerwlox (@dougwalkerwlox) May 30, 2018

In anticipation of Teacher Appreciation Week, Dominique Oglesby took to their Facebook account last May to praise Steve Marchion, their English instructor at Robert E. Lamberton High School in Overbrook Park.
“Man, I had never been pushed or challenged the way they challenged me,” wrote Oglesby, who had graduated and was then a student at Penn State's Harrisburg campus. “He made me appreciate the art of reading and writing! One of the main reasons I am a humanities major today!”
On Monday, Marchion announced on their Facebook account that their former student had died: “Yesterday this world was robbed of an amazing woman.”
Oglesby was fatally shot during an argument at a West Philadelphia bar. Them father and grandfather were also shot after they arrived and the fight escalated, police said.
They were shot once in the back outside the Galaxy West Lounge on the 5200 block of Market Street around 4:20 p.m. Sunday, police said.
Homicide Capt. John Ryan said the shooting occurred after Oglesby was involved in an argument with another woman and a man inside the bar. The man, whom police did not identify, twice tried to stop the argument, Ryan said. But tensions rose, Oglesby's family members arrived, and a “whole big melee [broke] out,” the police captain said.
They said it didn't appear that Oglesby or their relatives previously knew the man and woman on the other side of the argument, and they declined to offer further details on the potential source of the dispute.
“Someone produces a firearm and irrecoverable mistakes” occur, Ryan said.
They were taken to Penn Presbyterian Medical Center and pronounced dead at 4:42 p.m.
Them father, 42, was struck in a foot, and their grandfather, 66, was hit in an arm. Police said both men were listed in stable condition. Authorities did not name them.
Attempts to reach Oglesby's family were not successful Monday afternoon. One man who described themselves as Oglesby's cousin lamented their passing on Facebook.
I want to give our condolence to my cousin Daniell and their husband for their daughter my cousin Dominique Oglesby she… Posted by Naji Muhammad on Sunday, March 18, 2018
A Penn State spokesperson said Oglesby was scheduled to graduate from the university's Harrisburg campus this spring.
Ryan said the investigation was ongoing.
On Facebook, Oglesby shared posts about their singing, family, the A's they got in their classes at Penn State, and their Christian faith. They commented about social issues and posted at least one photo of their cat, Disney.
Marchion, the English teacher at Lamberton High School, wrote on Facebook that Oglesby was “bright, funny, hard-working, and passionate. They would call me out when they thought I was wrong and they would argue and defend their position until the bell rang. Dom would even come back and conceded their point the next day if they found a reason to change their position.”
In particular, Marchion recalled one of their lessons on an Andre Dubus short story, “The Killings,” and how they understood the character of the father and their need for revenge after the murder of their son.
Marchion wrote: “Class stopped for the remaining 20 minutes as Dom argued that no amount of hurt or pain or anger or sorrow could ever justify taking another person's life.”
They concluded: “please know that every life you touched is better now having had you in it.”
Yesterday this world was robbed of an amazing woman. Dom-Kimani Oglesby stood out to so many people for so many reasons…. Posted by Steve Marchion on Monday, March 19, 2018

Throughout the season, which kicks off June 10 at 9 p.m., the returning judges and old friends share plenty of laughs as they search for the next big name in food.
“The next Food Network Star has to be super dynamic. They have to blend education and entertainment,” says Flay. “Like-ability is 99 percent of this.”

With guest appearances from Food Network legends like Pioneer Woman Ree Drummond, Duff Goldman, Alex Guarnaschelli and Molly Yeh, the contestants have a lot of star power to impress. PEOPLE's own Editor Director Jess Cagle will even get a chance to judge the rising chefs on an upcoming episode.
There will also be a familiar face among the competitors. During Food Network Star: Comeback Kitchen, airing Sundays leading up to the new season, eight former finalists compete for the final spot in Orlando.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Indianapolis International Airport is hosting exhibits honoring Robert F. Kennedy, who gave an iconic speech in the city following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.
Visitors to the airport can view photos and stories of people who attended Kennedy's April 4, 1968, speech, which was given in a predominantly poor African-American neighborhood.
They can also read a transcription of the speech, which is credited with preventing rioting in Indianapolis after King's assassination while other U.S. cities burned in the unrest. Kennedy themselves was assassinated months later.
The exhibits commemorate the 50th anniversary of their remarks and will be up through early April.
NEW YORK — Donald Trump's tweets have provided fodder for their adversaries, fuel for their supporters and — at times — frustration for a news media still not quite sure how to cover this president-elect. And their new top spokesperson says you can expect a lot more of them, possibly from multiple fronts.
Incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer was asked Monday during an interview on Fox News whether Trump planned to maintain their current Twitter account (@realDonaldTrump), or tweet from the official account currently held by President Barack Obama (@POTUS). But who said they had to choose?
“I think he'll probably be tweeting from both, or whatever they choose,” Spicer said.
Trump will inherit the official presidential account once they officially take office later this month. Obama was the first sitting president to assume the @POTUS account, which was created last year. Prior to that, Obama tweeted occasionally from the @BarackObama account, which has been run by their presidential campaign staffers and then the spin-off nonprofit “Organizing for Action.”
When Obama leaves office on January 20, all of the more than 300 tweets on the @POTUS timeline will be archived and then wiped clean from the account itself to make way for Trump, but the account will keep its nearly 13 million followers.
That total, while otherwise impressive, is dwarfed by the more than 18 million accounts that follow @realDonaldTrump. (The president-elect also has millions of followers on both Facebook and Instagram.)
Trump has been a prolific Twitter user for years, using their account to promote their business and political interests and relentlessly taunt their adversaries. The tweets are often impetuous and nocturnal, and at times seem to be prompted by whatever Trump has just seen on television.
But there is no question that Trump has prospered politically from their use of social media, even as many worry about the possible consequences of their tweets once they are sent from the Oval Office. Following their election in November, Trump said in an interview on “60 Minutes” that they would be “very restrained” on Twitter once they become president.
On Sunday, in an interview with ABC's “This Week,” Spicer said that Trump's social media reach “freaks the mainstream media out.”
“You know what, the fact of the matter is that, when they tweet they get results,” Spicer said.
Spicer, who has promised changes to the way the White House interacts with the press, reiterated that point in their interview Monday on Fox News.
“He understands the ability to go straight to the American people and have a conversation with them,” they said. “Now I know that is unbelievably frustrating to the mainstream media, but that is what makes them so authentic is they can speak truth to power on Twitter, on Facebook, on Instagram, get a message out and have a conversation with the American people and not have it filtered through the mainstream media.”

TAMPA, Fla. — Steven Stamkos is back.
Stamkos set up the go-ahead goal in their return from a right knee injury and the Tampa Bay Lightning beat the Florida Panthers 5-3 on Friday night in the season opener for both teams.
Stamkos missed the final 65 games last season with a torn meniscus in the knee, an injury that required surgery. They sent a pass from the left circle through the slot to Vladislav Namestnikov, who put Tampa Bay up 3-2 from near the post 59 seconds into the final period during a power play.
"I was looking forward to this game for a while," Stamkos said. "Training camp is one thing, preseason's another. Getting into the regular season is different. It was a good step and it felt pretty good. I'm just going to keep improving and getting stronger as the season goes on."
Roberto Luongo turned aside Stamkos' shot from the slot late in the second.
Ondrej Palat had two goals, and Brayden Point and Nikita Kucherov also scored for the Lightning. Andrei Vasilevskiy made 33 saves.
Tampa Bay missed the playoffs last season after reaching the Stanley Cup Finals and the Eastern Conference Finals in 2015 and 2016, respectively.
"These wins mean a lot," Stamkos said. "We took advantage of a big power play in the third and got the lead, and held on to it."
Florida got goals from Connor Brickley Mark Pysyk and Jonathan Huberdeau, and Luongo stopped 20 shots. New Panthers coach Bob Boughner took the loss in their NHL coaching debut.
"We did a lot of good things," Florida defenceman Keith Yandle said. "I like the way we played. I like the way that we competed."
OSAGE COUNTY – Law enforcement authorities in Osage County are investigating a case of illegal hunting, trespassing case and asking the public for help to identify suspects.

HALIFAX -- A weatherman says they got more than they bargained for during a recent trip to a Costco in Halifax after finding a live scorpion in a bag of bananas.
Nathan Coleman, a reporter for The Weather Network, says they were unloading groceries when their 11-year-old daughter spotted something squirming in a plastic bag.
Coleman says they dismissed the rustling until their mother put the bananas away and noticed the scorpion.
They say they double-bagged the arachnid and drove to the Nova Scotia Museum of Natural History, where it has been jarred for observation.
Coleman says a warehouse manager has apologized to them and says Costco is looking into the incident, but they think the product should be pulled from the shelves in the interest of safety.
They say he's hoping to find out whether the scorpion is venomous and how it was able to journey thousands of kilometres.
90,000 fans are expected to pack the MCG for the clash between the Pies and Bombers

With the Trump administration vowing to tighten rules for skilled workers entering the United States, India's software services companies are worried. Indian IT giants outsource tens of thousands of tech specialists to the United States each year, and limiting the visa program that brings them in could disrupt their multibillion-dollar industry.
Congress and the White House have targeted what is arguably the most coveted of U.S. visas: the H1-B. It's "a kind of temporary work visa that allows professionals from other countries to work in the United States for a designated U.S. employer," explains Stephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell University immigration law professor.
Yale-Loehr says that with the economy picking up, the program is in particularly big demand. Last year, U.S. companies that sought to bring highly skilled workers to the U.S. filed 236,000 petitions that went into a lottery for just 85,000 H1-B visas, the legal cap. The bulk of the winners: Indian computer specialists, many of them graduates of U.S. universities.
Yale-Loehr says that places like Europe and Australia have special visas to attract such talent, but that the United States doesn't.
"We have to shoehorn high-tech workers into categories like the H1-B, and it's getting more difficult every year," they say.
Indeed, newly introduced legislation in Congress and drafts of executive orders reportedly circulating in the Trump White House would tighten the H1-B program.
Indian software services firms last year earned 60 percent of their $108 billion in export revenues from the U.S. Their executives will travel to Washington this month to lobby against measures that take aim at one of India's most successful industries.
One bill proposes more than doubling the minimum wage of H1-B holders, which by law is set at $60,000. Critics argue the H1-B has been misused to displace American workers, and that there has been an incentive to prefer Indian IT workers because they are cheaper.
Shailesh Chitnis, with the data mining and analysis company Compile, says that while the median salary for all H1-B holders is $71,000, most but not all Indian outsourcers pay below that. If they had to double salaries, Chitnis says, Indian IT companies would have to change their 20-year-old business model.
"Because these organizations are not going to be bringing in people at $120,000 to fill those jobs — it would simply be too expensive," they say. "They'll have to look at some other alternatives."
But Shevendra Singh with India's National Association of Software Services Companies, or NASSCOM, refutes allegations that Indian companies are dislocating American workers or supplying low-paid labor. Singh says there is demand in the U.S. for Indian technical talent because of a severe shortage of qualified Americans with degrees in science, technology, engineering and math.
"The crux of the issue is the STEM skill shortage in the U.S.," Singh says.
In its 2012 report, the U.S. president's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology found that "fewer than 40-percent of students who enter college intending to major in a STEM field complete a STEM degree." The council concluded that in the next decade, economic forecasts point to a need to produce "approximately 1 million more college graduates in STEM fields than expected under current assumptions."
R. Chandrashekhar, president of NASSCOM, says that if the skills aren't available in the U.S. — and companies can't bring workers in — the jobs either won't get done or they will go out of the country and be done remotely.
"Talent has become more important than investment or trade," they say. "And those who consciously cut themselves off from the global supply chains of talent are depriving themselves of a good thing."
Chandrashekhar notes that the intermingling of American and Indian ingenuity helped build Silicon Valley, and says protectionist impulses could weaken the United States, and what makes it unique.
"America is No. 1," Chandrashekhar says. "What has really helped them to rise, absolutely, to the top, is that they have attracted talent from across the world. ... It would be really a pity if that was reversed without thinking it through."
Immigration expert Yale-Loehr, co-author of a 21-volume treatise on immigration law, agrees that the United States faces a crisis in maintaining its innovative and competitive edge, and says it should be inviting more, not less, IT talent to its shores.
"In a globalized economy, the best and the brightest want to work in the best places — and if they're unable work in the United States, or it takes too long or is too difficult, they'll find a place in Canada or Europe or India where their talents can be appreciated," they say.
If implemented, Yale-Loehr says the draft executive order would initiate a review of the H1-B program but likely have no direct, immediate impact.
However, they say "it sends a strong signal that we no longer like foreign workers — we're all about only U.S. workers."
That, Yale-Loehr says, is eventually going to hurt the U.S.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:
In India, tech companies are worried that the Trump administration is preparing to limit visas for foreign skilled workers. A huge number of those visas called H-1Bs are held by Indians, but Congress and the White House say the program could be a threat to American jobs. From New Delhi, NPR's Julie McCarthy has more.
JULIE MCCARTHY, BYLINE: In the alphabet soup of U.S. visas, the H-1B is arguably the most coveted.
STHEPHEN YALE-LOEHR: An H-1B visa is a kind of temporary work visa that allows professionals from other countries to work in the United States for a designated U.S. employer.
MCCARTHY: Cornell immigration law professor Stephen Yale-Loehr says the program is in big demand. Last year, U.S. companies that sought to bring high-skilled workers to the states filed 236,000 petitions that went to a lottery that drew just 85,000 H-1B visas. The bulk of the winners - Indian computer specialists, many graduates from U.S. universities. Yale-Loehr says places like Europe and Australia have special visas to attract such talent.
YALE-LOEHR: We don't, and so we have to shoehorn those high-tech workers into existing categories like the H-1B. And it's getting more difficult every year.

Last year's cool Volkswagen California XXL Concept will finally morph into a production machine. Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles has just released the first teaser images of the Crafter-based camper van, which will be revealed in full during the 2018 Caravan Salon in Düsseldorf, Germany, scheduled for 24 August to 2 September.
The commercial vehicle division of the German auto giant promises the transition to a production model won't result in a sacrificed design, as the camper will be offered with а single or two-tone paintwork. That's hardly a surprise, given the fact that the concept looked nearly production ready a year ago.
Inside the roomy cabin, there will be a bathroom with а shower and WC, while at the back a large sleeping area and a kitchen with a sink, gas hob, and a couple of fridges will make life on the move easier. Judging by the teaser images, the new camper van will be fitted with a massive panoramic roof for an airy feel and a view to the stars at night – a feature first seen in the namesake concept from last year (pictured in the gallery below). It will be interesting to see whether the version ready for the road will also receive the study's rotating front seats.
The new camper van is based on the Crafter bus, which means it will most likely share its engine lineup. We expect the most popular choice to be a 2.0-liter turbodiesel motor with 177 horsepower (130 kilowatts) and 302 pound-feet (410 Newton-meters) of torque. A dual-clutch automatic gearbox and an all-wheel drive will channel the power to all four wheels.
46 photos
The California camper is the most successful camper van ever constructed with more than 100,000 deliveries since 1988. The variant that's still on sale is based on the sixth generation Volkswagen Transporter and is offered with 2.0-liter diesel and gasoline engines.

Inside the PhotoLink Library this time, are some signs that winter is not all bad. If your view of it is through a camera, Mike Stevens says there is much to be happy about.
Kate is the editor of Naked Security. She's been writing and talking about technology and security for more years than they care to count.
Kourtney Kardashian has slammed womanizer Scott Disick.
The 38-year-old reality TV star is fed up with seeing their former boyfriend - who is the father of their three children - photographed with a bevy of beauties and in a scathing attack, they called their women "hookers".
In a clip for 'Keeping Up With The Kardashians', filmed before Scott, 34, started dating Sofia Richie, 19, they fumed: "Why can't they get it together? I have to handle it when he's out photographed with a different hooker every day."
Kourtney's mother Kris Jenner implied that Scott was jealous after they jetted off for a girls' trip to Mexico and they were acting out.
They said: "I think they were jealous. Because you were having fun, spending time with other people."
However, Kourtney insisted that Scott - who reportedly cheated on them in the past - had no right to be jealous.
They said: "Well, that's really not fair. It's just like, I can't even live my life. I can't even go anywhere. They need to get a f***ing life and leave me alone.
"All they do is try to make everybody else feel bad for them and try to make me look like the bad guy in the situation when clearly I'm not, from 10 years of this going on."
But Kris insisted that Kourtney would be "sad" if Scott did in fact move on from their relationship.
They added: "You always want what you can't have. And when somebody is right there giving you their heart on a platter."
The Olympic curling fields are set, with men's and women's teams from Denmark and the Italian men grabbing the last spots during a qualification tournament in Pilsen, Czech Republic.
Sisters Madeleine and Denise Dupont helped the Danish women qualify on Sunday with a 5-4 victory over Italy. Later, their brother, Oliver Dupont, qualified with the Danish men when the team skipped by Rasmus Stjerne beat the Czechs 4-2.
The Italian team is skipped by Joel Retornez, who made their Olympic debut by receiving the hosts' berth at the 2006 Winter Games in Turin.
Denmark joins Canada, Switzerland, Britain, Sweden, Japan, the United States and host Korea as nations with both men's and women's teams in the games.
The women's field will also include China and a potential team from Russia, pending an IOC decision on its eligibility. Norway and Italy only qualified for the men's field.

July 4 (UPI) -- Oscar-winning actor Linda Hunt said they were involved in a traffic crash this week, but not seriously injured.
"Yesterday, I was involved in a minor traffic accident and taken to the hospital. I'm pleased to report I'm recovering well and have no serious injuries. Thank you for all the well wishes! I'm looking forward to starting production on NCIS: Los Angeles later this summer," Hunt said in a statement to CBS2 in Los Angeles on Tuesday.
TMZ reported the 73-year-old actor was driving a black BMW SUV when they made a left turn and collided with a car and another SUV.
Police were investigating the cause of the crash.

"Our results show a clear reduction in anxiety in the first hour after the meditation session, and our preliminary results suggest that anxiety was significantly lower one week after the meditation session," said study author John Durocher.  They are an assistant professor of physiology at Michigan Technological University's department of biological sciences.
Anxiety can raise the risk for heart disease: Previous studies have shown that arterial stiffness may be worsened by traumatic life events, job strain, depression and either short-term or chronic anxiety, the researchers said. Heart changes linked with anxiety can lead to high blood pressure and organ damage.
For the study, Durocher and their colleagues recruited 14 participants with normal blood pressure but high levels of anxiety. The investigators evaluated the volunteers' heart rate, blood pressure, aortic blood pressure and arterial stiffness before and after a 60-minute guided beginner mindfulness meditation session. This type of meditation focuses on breathing and awareness of one's thoughts.
"This study is different because we examined the effect of a single mindfulness meditation session on anxiety and cardiovascular outcomes, while other studies have examined the effect of several days or weeks of mindfulness meditation," Durocher explained.
The study was to be presented Monday at the American Physiological Society annual meeting, in San Diego. Research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.
The research showed that a one-hour session had notable benefits. Most of the participants continued to practice mindfulness meditation and experienced even more improvements one week later.
"Participants also had reduced mechanical stress on their arteries an hour after the session. This could help to reduce stress on organs like the brain and kidneys and help prevent conditions such as high blood pressure," Durocher said in a meeting news release.
"The results suggest that a single mindfulness meditation session may help to reduce cardiovascular risk in those with moderate anxiety," they added.

FLINT, Mich. (AP) — Robert Skidmore was born in Flint, raised a family there and lived their entire life in and around the blue collar town that — next to Detroit — was synonymous with manufacturing of cars and trucks.
But their December 2015 death has been blamed on Legionnaires' disease and linked to a tainted water crisis that on Wednesday led to involuntary manslaughter and other charges against five officials, including the director of Michigan's Health and Human Services department.
Skidmore, 85, was one of 12 people to die from the disease and nearly 100 cases of people being sickened from it.
“Everybody was pretty upset, rightfully, finding out this could be the reason that they died,” grandson Craig Skidmore of the Legionnaires' revelations. “It definitely didn't set well with us.”
Wednesday's charges are part of the criminal investigation into how Flint's water system became poisoned after officials tapped the Flint River in 2014.
Nick Lyon, 48, is accused of failing to alert the majority-black population about an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in the Flint area, which has been linked by some experts to poor water quality in 2014-15.
An involuntary manslaughter conviction carries up to 15 years in prison.
Lyon also is charged with misconduct in office for allegedly obstructing university researchers who are studying if the surge in cases was linked to the Flint River.
The others charged with involuntary manslaughter were already facing other accusations. They are: Darnell Earley, who was Flint's emergency manager when the city used the river; Howard Croft, who ran Flint's public works department; Liane Shekter Smith; and Stephen Busch. Shekter Smith and Busch were state environmental regulators.
Prosecutors also brought charges against the state's chief medical officer, Dr. Eden Wells, 54, who is accused of obstruction of justice and lying to an investigator.
Flint began using water from the Flint River while under state emergency management, but did not treat it to reduce corrosion. Toxic lead from old plumbing leached into the water system, causing elevated levels in children and leaving residents to drink and bathe with bottled or filtered water.
Some experts also have linked the water to Legionnaires' disease, a type of pneumonia caused by bacteria that thrive in warm water and infect the lungs. People can get sick if they inhale mist or vapor, typically from cooling systems.
Robert Skidmore was admitted to a hospital in June 2015 with symptoms consistent with pneumonia. They died at home six months later.
Flint's failing economy, the water crisis and other problems troubled Robert Skidmore, an avid hunter, according to Craig Skidmore, 29, who lives in nearby Burton.
Their grandfather would bemoan “how Flint changed for the worst from when they were growing up and raising their family,” Craig Skidmore told The Associated Press.
Robert Skidmore retired in 1987 after 37 years at General Motors Fisher Body plant. They would spend much of their free time at the family's cabin “up north” in the tiny community of Lake George in Clare County.
“I think if they had their way they would have moved up north, but my grandma was a people person and everyone was in Flint. They didn't want to take them away from that.”
Craig Skidmore said the family would have dinner at their grandparent's home almost every Sunday until their grandmother died in June 2015.
Defense attorneys for the six officials spoke out against the charges.
“The true facts simply do not support the prosecution's claims,” said Chip Chamberlain and Larry Willey who are representing Lyon.
Convincing a jury that the officials' failure to disclose the risk of Legionnaires' disease caused a death would be difficult, Wayne State University law professor Peter Henning said.
“This case is going to become a battle of the experts, something we don't usually see in a homicide or manslaughter prosecution,” Henning said. “This is a tough case for the attorney general. They can get a conviction but it's not going to be easy.”
The Michigan Civil Rights Commission issued a report in February blaming “systemic racism” going back decades for the problems that caused the water crisis in Flint.

The Australian Securities and Investment Commission investigation into Rugby Australia's controversial dealings with the Melbourne Rebels ahead of axing Western Force from Super Rugby is imminent.
New RA chief executive Raelene Castle, in their first visit to Perth since their appointment seven weeks ago, confirmed the move yesterday.
“I think it's imminent. I think the feedback is that we were expecting it so it should be any day,” said Castle, who was not RA CEO when the decision to axe the Force was made.
“At the end of the day there is going to be an ASIC inquiry. It will come with some findings and that is going to be probably as close to the truth as we get. I think we need to have a look at that.”
A senate inquiry into the future of the sport recommended the ASIC inquiry when their report was handed down last year.
Meanwhile, Castle did not rule out a return of the Force to a national competition when the current Super Rugby broadcast deal ends in two years.
That could be in a new Super Rugby format or an integration of the tournament with billionaire Andrew Forrest's new Indo Pacific Rugby competition.
“Absolutely (that's an option). That's a piece of work that Rugby Australia are doing at the moment,” they said.
“They will take their views to the SANZAAR table.
“We all have to remain open-minded because who knows what the new (Super Rugby) version might look like.
“It's about finding the compromise that works from a commercial perspective.”
RA must give its tick of approval with the major stumbling block being whether Australian players in IPRC teams will be eligible for Wallabies selection.
“We've always been open to the discussions. It actually comes down to the detail about eligibility,” Castle said.
“We have a talent pool as a pathway into Wallabies selection and we want to keep more of those playing in Australia. That's always the aim from a Rugby Australia perspective.”
Castle had talks with Forrest, the RugbyWA board, State Government representatives local club presidents and disgruntled Force fans during their two day visit.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations says unidentified gunmen have attacked two U.N. peacekeeping sites in Mali, killing one Malian soldier and one U.N. peacekeeper.
U.N. deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said the U.N. camp in Douentza in the Mopti region of central Mali came under attack Monday morning. They said in addition to the two soldiers, two gunmen were killed when U.N. peacekeepers fired back.
Haq said the U.N. joins the peacekeeping mission's condemnation of the attack.
They said armed men launched an attack Monday afternoon against the U.N. peacekeeping mission's headquarters in Timbuktu city in northern Mali. They said the mission dispatched a quick reaction force and helicopters to the scene “and sporadic gunfire is still ongoing.”
The peacekeeping mission in Mali is the deadliest of the U.N.'s 16 global peacekeeping operations.

Gloucester's Henry Walker scored two tries as England got their World Rugby U20 Championship campaign off to a winning start.
The hooker played an instrumental role in the bonus-point 39-18 victory over Argentina in Narbonne with academy prop Alex Seville also coming off the bench early in the game.
England led 19-15 at half-time through two Jordan Olowofela tries, a try for Walker and two James Grayson conversions.Argentina had responded with tries via Santiago Chocobares and Bautista Pedemonte as well as five points from the boot of Juan Bautista Daireaux.Second-half tries from Walker and Marcus Smith, both converted, and Tom Hardwick's penalty helped seal victory for England with Joaquín de la Vega Mendía kicking Argentina's only points of the half.
Walker's first try to put England ahead for the first time when they bundled over off the back of a collapsed maul, while they charged over in the second half for the bonus-point score.
They will next play Italy in Perpignan on Sunday before ending their Pool B fixtures against Scotland in Beziers.

Gloucester scrum-half Charlie Chapman also scored for Scotland in their first game against Italy Under-20s but they slipped to an agonising 27-26 defeat in Beziers.
Parents looking for a quick footy fix for their children are in the sights of the AFL.
Auskick Express is being offered to time-poor parents or those uncertain whether football is right for their children in a program to start in July.
It will enable young players to join in for a quarter of the full 16-week Auskick season at the reduced cost of $40. WA football star Rhys Palmer said they felt for their parents when they were playing multiple sports as a child.
“For me it was always sport — footy, baseball, athletics and cross-country — and there was always something going on,” Palmer said. “I owe my parents everything for giving me every opportunity to live out my childhood dreams.”
Palmer's junior club Bullcreek-Leeming has signed on to the Auskick Express program after the WA Football Commission called for expressions of interest last week.
Palmer urged parents to give their children a chance at football.
“I started playing when I was five or six and I lived and breathed it at that age,” they said. “It's a lot of fun times playing with your mates. It's such a good outlet and such a good sport and sets you up for living a good, healthy lifestyle.”
WAFC engagement and community football manager Troy Kirkham said Auskick Express made the game more accessible for parents and children.
Concord, North Carolina (February 13, 2017) – Announced today, Venturini Motorsports (VMS) unveiled the addition of Christopher Bell, Tanner Thorson and Raphaël Lessard to the team's 2017 ARCA Racing Series presented by Menards driver roster.
The trio of drivers will combine for seven races driving for Venturini Motorsports.
While drivers Christopher Bell and Tanner Thorson return to the team, 15-year old Raphaël Lessard is set to make their ARCA Series debut with VMS in Nashville.
“Toyota Racing Development is proud of our relationship with Venturini Motorsports,” says Jack Irving, Director, Team & Support Services Toyota Racing Development. “Entering their 35th year of ARCA competition, Venturini has set a formidable driver roster across the board and is poised for another winning season. I'm excited to watch this young group develop and perform.”
Christopher Bell, 2017's Midget Chili Bowl Nationals winner and full-time driver for Kyle Busch Motorsports in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, will drive the number No.15 at Illinois State Fairgrounds on August 20 and the No.25 Toyota Camry at Chicagoland Speedway on September 14.
22-year old Bell, a two-time ARCA Series winner with VMS, swept both races at Salem Speedway last season while finishing third at Chicagoland Speedway. In five series attempts Bell has yet to finish outside the top-10 spots.
Tanner Thorson, 2016's USAC National Midget Champion and two-time National Midget Driver of the Year, returns to VMS after last season's sole ARCA start at Springfield's Illinois State Fairgrounds dirt-mile. The 20-year old Thorson will drive the No.25 Toyota Camry at Madison Int'l Speedway on June 23 and the No. 15 Toyota Camry at DuQuoin State Fairgrounds dirt-mile on September 4.
Thorson will also drive full-time in USAC with Keith Kunz Motorsports throughout the 2017 season.
Raphaël Lessard, a native of St-Joseph-de-Beauce, Quebec, Canada, will compete in three races with VMS driving the team's No.25 Toyota Camry. Lessard, the youngest driver on the team's roster, was the 2016 CARS TOUR Champion driving for David Gilliland Racing last season.
Lessard will make their ARCA debut at the Fairgrounds Speedway Nashville on April 8 in addition to making appearances at Salem Speedway on April 30 and at the high banks of Winchester Speedway on August 6.
“We're extremely proud of our relationship with Toyota Racing and the opportunity to continue our work with such talented drivers as Bell, Thorson, and Lessard,” says Billy Venturini, Director of Competition for Venturini Motorsports.
“It's a great honor to be able to carry the Toyota brand. All three of these drivers have a very high ceiling for success in motorsports. Christopher, with ARCA and NASCAR wins already under their belt, along with Tanner, have each proven themselves as two of the most dominant midget drivers in recent years and will both continue to improve as their stock car careers unfold. I followed Raphaël's success last year and see tremendous talent in this kid. They have an infectious personality and will be fun to watch,” added Venturini.
Entering its' 35th year of ARCA competition, VMS is widely-known for their success developing young drivers in the ARCA Series and has recorded 43-team victories during their longstanding series involvement. Thirty of team's series victories have come since 2008.

MONDAY, March 19, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The scenario may sound familiar: Your doctor sends your prescription electronically to the pharmacy, and you go to pick it up. Only you can't, because the insurance company requires "prior authorization" for that particular medication.
Now you're caught in the middle, as your insurance company requests paperwork from your doctor to defend the need for that prescription. But new research suggests that process may be more than just annoying.
A survey of 1,000 practicing physicians by the American Medical Association (AMA) found that doctors believe these prior authorizations affect clinical outcomes for 9 of 10 patients.
In addition, 92 percent of doctors said prior authorizations have led to delays in patient care.
"The issue of prior authorizations is getting worse, and the burden in terms of time consumption on paperwork has grown. And that's time I'm not getting to spend with patients," said Dr. Jack Resneck Jr., chair-elect of the AMA.
"There was a time when I expected a prior authorization request for some things I was ordering, like for very expensive or unusual medications. But the request for prior authorizations has grown exponentially, and a fair number I write now are for generic medications that never required a prior authorization in the past," they said.
Resneck said most requests are ultimately approved, but not without recurring paperwork and multiple phone calls. And this delays patient care.
The survey found that nearly two-thirds of patients experienced a delay of at least one business day, while almost one-third had to wait at least three business days.
The delay can sometimes prompt almost 8 in 10 patients to abandon their prescribed course of treatment, the AMA survey found.
This isn't the first time the AMA or others have raised this issue. In fact, the AMA and other health care groups have been working with the trade association America's Health Insurance Plans to improve the prior authorization process.
"Prior authorization is an important and valuable tool to protect patients by ensuring a prescribed therapy is safe and effective for the patient's condition and is a covered benefit," said Cathryn Donaldson, director of communications for America's Health Insurance Plans.
But Donaldson said, "We recognize that the prior authorization process can and should be improved."
The doctors surveyed would agree: 84 percent feel the burden on their practice due to prior authorizations is high or extremely high, and 86 percent say the burden has increased over the past five years.
On average, doctors are receiving 14 prior authorizations for prescriptions each week, and 15 prior authorization requests for medical services, the survey found.
And it takes almost 15 hours (or two business days) to process these requests. More than one-third of the physicians surveyed have staff members who work exclusively on prior authorizations.
Almost 80 percent of prior authorizations are sometimes, often or always required for medicines a patient has already been taking for a chronic medical condition.
"I spend a lot of time thinking about the best thing to prescribe for my patients, and at the same time, I'm trying to also be a good flight attendant of resources," Resneck said.
"For myself, I'd be happier not to be subject to prior authorizations, but I can understand that there will be times -- like when there's a brand-new or very expensive therapy -- when a prior authorization is required," they said.
But, Resneck added, there needs to be more transparency from insurers. They said they can enter a prescription into an electronic health record and send it via computer to the pharmacist, and at no time do these systems tell them a drug might need prior authorization. Patients don't find out until they've gotten to the pharmacy.
Some of the ideas the medical groups and insurers have come to a consensus on include:
Reducing the amount of prior authorizations required for physicians who have shown to practice evidence-based medicine or participate in a value-based agreement with the insurer;
Reviewing and eliminating prior authorizations for medications that no longer need it;
Improving communication between providers and insurers;
Protecting patient continuity of care even during changes in coverage or insurance providers;
Accelerating adoption of electronic standards and increasing insurer transparency.
The AMA survey was released March 19.

The Ford GT is already an exclusive supercar, with only 1,000 planned for production over four years. That translates to just 250 each year, and now Ford Performance is offering a special livery for 2018 that draws inspiration from the red-and-white 1967 GT40 that won LeMans that year. Officially called the Ford GT '67 Heritage editions, the appearance package adds numerous special touches to the car both inside and out.
“In creating a worthy successor to the 2017 Heritage edition, we logically looked at our next historic Le Mans victory with the all-American team of Dan Gurney and A.J. Foyt,” said Dave Pericak, global director Ford Performance. “The 2018 Ford GT '67 Heritage editions pays homage to that win, with a modern take on one of the most important vehicles in Ford's storied history of racing.”
The obvious difference compared to other models is the exposed carbon package and unique white exterior striping over a bright Race Red finish, complete with oval shields on both doors and the hood bearing the number one, representing Gurney and Foyt's GT40. 20-inch aluminum wheels with a silver satin finish round out the heritage upgrades on the outside.
Driver and passenger in the '67 Heritage editions will be seeing red on the inside, thanks to red accent stitching for new leather trim on the carbon fiber seats as well as the steering wheel. More red can be found on the seat belt webbing, while paddle shifters get a gray finish. Other details include satin stainless appliqués on various parts of the interior, combined with exposed carbon fiber for the center console, door sills, and air register pods. And meticulous buyers will of course love the unique serialized identification plate that certifies the car as a proper '67 Heritage editions GT.
Ford is coy as to how many '67 Heritage edition models it will produce, saying only that “limited quantities will be available for 2018.” Since that also describes the entire Ford GT production run for the year, it's safe to say this livery will be extremely rare.

Tonight several community members came out to the civic center and held a vigil in response to the Charlottesville protests
After a brief opening from the coordinator of the vigil, a deacon spoke about religion and the fight to end racism in America
.
Many community members said it is important to hold a vigil like this for a variety of reasons.
“The importance of having a vigil like this is that everyone from Great Falls all the way to Virginia knows that we're all human beings, we are all the same, and we aren't going to tolerate bigotry and racism and we aren't going to stand for hate” says Laura White.
After the deacon spoke, many community members decided to put their own voices out to the crowd, a variety of topics were discussed from homophobia, white supremacy, terrorism, racism, what our wars were fought against, and how to combat these issues in America.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced the Peace Prize in Oslo, culminating a week in which Nobel laureates have been named in medicine, physics, chemistry and literature. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons received the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize.
The 2017 Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), the Norwegian Nobel Committee said Friday.
"The organization is receiving the award for its work to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and for its ground-breaking efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition of such weapons," the committee said in a statement.
"ICAN and a majority of UN member states have contributed to fraternity between nations by supporting the Humanitarian Pledge. And through its inspiring and innovative support for the UN negotiations on a treaty banning nuclear weapons, ICAN has played a major part in bringing about what in our day and age is equivalent to an international peace congress," the statement read.
The next steps toward attaining a world free of nuclear weapons must involve the nuclear-armed states, the committee added.

WASHINGTON (AP) — As Alabama votes to fill the seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the choice between Republican Roy Moore and Democrat Doug Jones has taken on outsized significance. Moore has faced allegations of sexual misconduct with teenagers, dividing the GOP and giving Democrats hope of picking up a seat in a reliably red state. Here is what to look for in Tuesday night's results:
WHAT IS THE TRUMP DRAW?
Alabama has once already proven the bounds of President Donald Trump's political influence. They endorsed Moore's GOP rival, Sen. Luther Strange, in the September primary, campaigning for them in Alabama hours before they were trounced by the state's conservative voters. Now Trump has wagered a greater sum on Moore's candidacy. The president resisted calls from their party's senior leadership to abandon Moore after the sexual misconduct allegations surfaced. They directed the Republican National Committee to re-enter the race on Moore's behalf, repeatedly attacked Jones, and recorded last-minute robo-calls on the Republican's behalf. A GOP defeat in the deep-red state would speak to the limits of Trump's ability to sway and motivate Republican voters.
WILL DEMOCRATIC TURNOUT EFFORTS PAY OFF?

In recent days, Democrats have pulled out the stops for Jones, including recorded calls from former President Barack Obama and visits from high-profile surrogates. They're trying to boost turnout among those most likely to be aggravated by Moore's controversial past, including black voters, and make inroads with suburban women_who proved to be pivotal to Democratic victories last month. Strong turnout and Democratic gains on both those fronts could point to trouble for Moore, and for the GOP going into next year.
WILL DEMOCRATS END THEIR SPECIAL ELECTION BAD LUCK?
Despite a ripe political climate, high-profile coverage, and huge injections of cash, Democrats are winless in five contests for vacant Republican congressional seats this year. All have been held in reliably Republican strongholds, but the defeats have still taken their toll on a party in a struggle for its identity. Wins in Virginia, New Jersey, and Maine in the November off-year election have provided some sorely-needed optimism for the 2018 midterms, and a Senate seat pick-up in Alabama would add pep to the party's step.
HOW WILL IT AFFECT RETIREMENTS?
Sensing a difficult midterm election looming, 16 Republican members of the House and two in the Senate have already announced they will not run again next year. The retirement gap_only six Democrats in the House and one in the Senate have said they won't run_can be an early indicator of what's to come in a midterm election. (A more even split of retirements exists for lawmakers retiring from Congress to seek other office.) Republican leaders are anticipating more retirements on their side from lawmakers in competitive seats where members are facing challenging and expensive contests. A Democratic victory statewide in Alabama could foretell a dire year ahead for Republicans, which could send more Republicans to announce their departures on their own terms.
WAS MOORE WORTH IT?
The Republican Party's decision to maintain support for Roy Moore stands to be a defining choice for years to come. The party chose to embrace a one-time pariah for reasons of political expediency, and then doubled-down in the face of troubling allegations of sexual assault and harassment. For the president, it's a matter of practicality_a loss would narrow the GOP's thin majority in the Senate even further at a time when their agenda faces critical tests. But other Republicans worry it's a short-term ploy that has sacrificed their moral authority and that may come back to haunt them in the coming year. Republican lawmakers have spent the past months struggling to answer questions about Moore and their long history of divisive comments, and should they win, their presence will loom large in the Capitol and on the campaign trail. If Moore keeps the Senate seat in Republican hands, it may justify the backlash for some GOP officials. If they lose, the GOP has stuck by a candidate despite accusations of sexual impropriety, and who has alienated vast swaths of the electorate, with nothing to show for it.

EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Alvin Ellis chose to stay at Michigan State, resisting the urge of following two of their former teammates and transferring to another school.
The Spartans are glad they did.
Ellis scored 15 of their 18 points with a 3-point barrage in the first half and finished with six 3-pointers — doubling their previous career high — to help Michigan State beat Ohio State 74-66 on Tuesday night.
“I'm happy for Alvin,” Spartans coach Tom Izzo said. “Anytime a kid goes through tough times and in this day and age, when everybody transfers, quits their job … goes to three high schools, four AAU teams, they didn't. They gutted it out. And you know what? It might end up being a heck of a deal for them and a great way to go out as a senior.”

Ellis watched Marvin Clark Jr. and Javon Bess transfer after last season, going to St. John's and Saint Louis, respectively, and decided to finish their career at Michigan State. Ellis scored a career-high 20 points in the Big Ten opener, helping the Spartans rally to win at Minnesota.
They didn't score as many points against the Buckeyes, but they had the best shooing stretch as a Spartan.
Ellis made five 3-pointers in a 3:38 span of the first half, helping the Spartans take a 21-12 lead and stunning the crowd and the Buckeyes because the senior was averaging just six points a game.
“I was feelin' it,” the reserve shooting guard said
Ellis finished 6 of 9 beyond the arc and 6 of 11 overall, falling two points shy of their career high.
“He was on fire,” Ohio State coach Thad Matta said.
Miles Bridges had 17 points and 11 rebounds and Nick Ward scored 15 for Michigan State (16-10, 8-5 Big Ten), which has won four of five.
Ohio State's Marc Loving scored 22 points and reserve JaQuan Lyle scored all 10 of their points in the first half after missing the previous game, a setback to No. 23 Maryland.
The Buckeyes (15-12, 5-9) have lost four of six.
GAME OF RUNS
After the Ellis-led surge for the Spartans, the Buckeyes scored 10 straight to take the lead before falling behind 40-34 at halftime.
The Spartans scored the first six points of the second half, building a 12-point lead. Ohio State, once again, rallied with a 17-6 run to pull within one point.
“We stopped the bleeding,” Loving said. “But weren't able to recover.”
Michigan State finished off the Buckeyes by outscoring them 12-2 to take an 11-point lead and they were able to keep a comfortable cushion.
IZZO TAKES ON DAKICH
During the game, Izzo didn't like it when Michigan State students were jeering ESPN analyst and chanting, “We hate Dak-ich! We hate Dak-ich!” After the game, Izzo was told Dakich, whose son plays basketball at Michigan, posted this reply on their Twitter account after the Wolverines beat Michigan State last week: “Sparty not only whines but now just dumb!! Couldn't get into UM?? “
“Twitter got them in trouble and they earned it,” Izzo said . “I'm surprised ESPN would let somebody say something like that that works for them. … Danny owes our fans and our students an apology.”
A message seeking comment was e-mailed to ESPN.
More than an hour after the game, Dakich appeared to delete the asupervisorstioned tweet.
BIG PICTURE
Ohio State: The Buckeyes, who played in the NIT last season, are in danger of failing to make the NCAA Tournament in two straight years for the first time since Matta took over the program in 2004.
“I think we're making progress, but obviously we're not there yet,” Matta said.
Michigan State: The Spartans have improved their chances of extending their NCAA Tournament streak to 20 with their recent surge of success.
UP NEXT:
Ohio State: Host Nebraska on Saturday.
Michigan State: Play at No. 16 Purdue on Saturday.

As they get to the details of how they killed Culleton, who was the first to die that day, their voice softens and they bury their head in their hands.
The night before the murders, they said, they went to see Culleton, who they claim to have dated, at their cottage on Kamaniskeg Lake, where they said they and their new boyfriend laughed at him.
Then they returned to their home, about 24 km away in Palmer Rapids, Ont., and drank rye with a neighbour while they discussed the Bible, before falling asleep on the couch.
The next morning, they borrowed a friend's car, stopped for gas and then drove back to Culleton's cottage.
"I remember thinking that God is really helping me because when I went to Carol's, Carol walked right outside," they say, so quietly it is at times difficult to hear, with long pauses between sentences.
"And then I asked her, I said, 'Why do you hate me, why are you doing this to me?' And then they closed the door, I was right there, and then I broke the window with my elbow and I reached in and I unlocked the door. And they said, 'This isn't you, Basil, this is not you'."
They said Culleton then told them a man was coming over to fix the electricity and they told them they were lying.
"There was a, a cable, a TV coil, I picked it up and I hit them with it and I wrapped it around their head. They just kept saying 'this is not you Basil, this is not you.' And then, then I walked around the cottage."
They said they found their purse and took their keys and phone and car. They threw the phone out the window as they drove so nobody could see the text message conversation they'd had.
They drove to Kuzyk's house, about 20 kilometres away in Wilno, Ont., and they too walked outside before going back into their home after seeing him. They followed.
"I asked Anastasia 'why did you lie in court?' and they said 'I didn't,' and the gun went off. Because it's just lying."
They said God then told them to get back in the car so they did and drove to Warmerdam's home, about 30 kilometres west in Cormac, Ont.
"What happened? I just drove in, walked in the door, they were sitting there, they went around the corner, I followed them Boom. That was it and I walked out. It was funny, like I wasn't even pulling the trigger on the gun, the gun was just going off. Boop."
Borutski at one point said the Bible makes a distinction between killing and murder and only murder is wrong because it is taking the life of someone who is innocent. That's why, they said, they didn't shoot themselves that day, because it would have been like murdering himself.
They said that throughout much of the day they experienced an out-of-body experience and described themselves repeatedly as a "zombie."
The trial resumes Tuesday.

Police are investigating a shooting near 33rd avenue and 20th street. According to the Gulfport Police Department, one female victim was sent to a local hospital with injuries. Officers responded to the scene around 12:30 this morning. A search for the suspect is currently underway. We'll keep you updated as more information becomes available.
TORONTO (AP) - The 25-year-old suspect who plowed a van into a crowded Toronto sidewalk was ordered held Tuesday on 10 counts of murder and 13 of attempted murder as Canadian authorities and the public sought to make sense of one of the deadliest mass killings in the country's modern history.
Alek Minassian showed little emotion as they made a brief appearance in a Toronto courtroom in a white jumpsuit and handcuffs. The judge ordered them detained without bond and scheduled the next hearing for May 10.
Their father, Vahe Minassian, cried and looked stunned inside the courtroom. Asked outside if they had any message for the families of the victims, they said quietly: "I'm sorry."
Police, meanwhile, continued to gather evidence. About 20 officers made their way down the van's deadly path on Yonge Street, which remained closed to traffic on Tuesday and taped off with yellow crime scene tape. Nearby, mourners had put together a makeshift memorial to the victims.
"It was like they were playing a video game, trying to kill as many people as possible," said Panna Patel, 42, who stopped by the memorial and had been at the scene a day earlier, getting cash from an ATM. "He was looking people directly in the eye, making eye contact, it was so scary. They aren't remorseful at all."
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau dismissed the possibility of terrorism, saying that authorities saw no national security element in the case.
The incident "hasn't changed the overall threat level in Canada," they told a news conference, though it occurred as Cabinet ministers from the G7 nations were meeting in Toronto.
Authorities have not disclosed a possible motive, though "the incident definitely looked deliberate," Police Chief Mark Saunders told reporters at a late-night news conference on Monday.
Saunders said Minassian, who lives in the Toronto suburb of Richmond Hill, had not been known to police previously. An online social media profile described them as a college student.
Authorities released few details in the case, saying the investigation was still underway, with witnesses being interviewed and surveillance video being examined.
"We are looking very strongly to what the exact motivation was for this particular incident to take place," Saunders said. "We need every single piece of this puzzle so we can have a fulsome picture and account as to exactly what took place here."
The driver was heading south on busy Yonge Street around 1:30 p.m. Monday, the streets crowded with people enjoying the first warm day of spring, when the van jumped onto the sidewalk.
Ali Shaker, who was driving near the van at the time, told Canadian broadcast outlet CP24 that the driver appeared to be moving deliberately through the crowd at more than 30 mph.
"He just went on the sidewalk," a distraught Shaker said. "He just started hitting everybody, man. They hit every single person on the sidewalk. Anybody in their way they would hit."
Another witness, Peter Kang, told CTV News that the driver did not seem to make any effort to stop.
"If it was an accident they would have stopped," Kang said. "But the person just went through the sidewalk. They could have stopped."
Video broadcast on several Canadian outlets showed police arresting the driver, dressed in dark clothes, after officers surrounded them and their rental Ryder van several blocks from where the incident occurred in the North York neighborhood of northern Toronto. They appeared to make some sort of gesture at the police with an object in their hand just before they ordered them to lie down on the ground and took them away.
Witness Phil Zullo said that they saw police arresting the suspect and people "strewn all over the road" where the incident occurred.
"I must have seen about five, six people being resuscitated by bystanders and by ambulance drivers," Zullo said. "It was awful. Brutal."
Toronto City Councilor Cesar Palacio identified one of the victims as 30-year-old Anne Marie D'Amico, whose parents live in their ward and who was a friend of their daughter. They recalled them as "a brilliant young girl" who was very active and interested in improving society.
D'Amico volunteered at a Canada-based international humanitarian charity called Live Different and helped build houses in the Dominican Republic in 2015 and 2017, according to Dave Hamilton, the charity's manager of school partnerships. They remembered them as "super-positive, always smiling, a funny person, always up for a challenge, and really wanted to help people out."
Police shut down the Yonge and Finch intersection in the aftermath of the incident and Toronto's transit agency suspended service on the subway line running through the area. The stretch of Yonge Street where the victims were struck was expected to stay blocked off for several days as police continue what is likely to be a lengthy investigation. Most businesses in the area were closed.
Trudeau on Monday expressed their sympathies for the victims.
"We should all feel safe walking in our cities and communities," they said. "We are monitoring this situation closely, and will continue working with our law enforcement partners around the country to ensure the safety and security of all Canadians."
It was the bloodiest mass killing in Canada since Dec. 6, 1989, when a man with semi-automatic rifle stormed into a classroom at the Ecole Polytechnique in Montreal, ordered all the men to leave, then shot 14 women before turning the gun on himself.
Monday's carnage prompted police to beef up security and close several streets around the Air Canada Centre for that night's Toronto-Boston NHL playoff game. Police tweeted that similar road closures might be in effect for the Toronto Raptors NBA playoff game on Wednesday night.
The incident occurred as Cabinet ministers from the major industrial countries were gathered in Canada to discuss a range of international issues in the run-up to the G7 meeting near Quebec City in June. Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale called it a "horrific attack" and said the G7 foreign ministers extended their condolences.

CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — The same jury that last month unanimously found Dylann Roof guilty in the slayings of nine black parishioners at a South Carolina church is returning to court to begin contemplating their punishment.
With the 22-year-old representing himself, the process is sure to be unconventional. But even if Roof is sentenced to death, it's highly unlikely he'd be executed anytime soon.
While prosecutors plan to call up to 38 people related to the nine people killed and three who survived the June 2015 slaughter during Bible study at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, Roof said last week they plan on calling no witnesses and presenting no evidence.
Roof was found guilty last month on 33 federal charges, including hate crimes and obstruction of the practice of religion. A jury took less than three hours to return its verdict, and a judge dismissed the jury for a break over the holidays.
Typically in what's known as the sentencing phase, defense attorneys call relatives and other witnesses to testify about their client's unsteady state of mind before and during the crimes. Given that background, the defense hopes, a jury might be more likely to spare the defendant's life and opt against the death penalty.
But Roof, who is acting as their own attorney, has said they plan to do no such thing.
In their journal, which was read in court during their trial, Roof said their doesn't believe in psychology, which they called “a Jewish invention” that “does nothing but invent diseases and tell people they have problems when they don't.”
Roof also seems to be determined to try to keep evidence embarrassing to them or their family out. Not only did they take over their own defense, but they asked the judge at a hearing Wednesday if they could file a motion limiting what prosecutors can introduce.
Roof also was adamant that a transcript of a hearing where they were found mentally competent not be released to the public.
“I know this is not a legal argument, but the unsealing of the competency hearing defeats the purpose of me representing myself,” Roof said at last week's hearing.
Neither Roof, nor U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel nor prosecutors have given specifics on the evidence Roof is objecting to.
On Thursday, Gergel ordered another competency evaluation of Roof “in an abundance of caution,” after their standby counsel filed a sealed motion again questioning Roof's mental ability to proceed. The judge's order specified they saw no reason to delay Tuesday's start of the penalty phase.
Roof's lawyers tried repeatedly both to stop them from being their own lawyer and to work mental health-related evidence into the first phase of their trial, saying they feared Roof fired them because they feared the attorneys would present evidence that would embarrass them when trying to save their lives.
Prosecutors objected at every turn, and Gergel wouldn't allow any of it into court, ruling mitigation evidence is allowable during sentencing and not before.
Court papers show prosecutors are expected to present evidence showing that Roof picked their victims because of their race, killed them to incite more violence, showed no remorse and killed three particularly vulnerable people who were 70 years old or older.
Evidence speaking to Roof's mental state, one expert argues, could make the difference between life and death.
“The Dylann Roof case is a classic example of the type of problem you can have when an obviously mentally ill or emotionally disturbed defendant is permitted to represent himself,” said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. “There's a huge difference in the eyes of a jury between someone they perceive as evil or despicable and someone they perceive as being seriously mentally ill. … If you take mental health out of it, you are putting a thumb on the scale of death.”
Both the judge's decision to allow Roof to represent themselves and waive the introduction of mental health evidence are sure to be raised in an inevitable appeal, Dunham argued.
Roof also faces nine murder charges in state court, where prosecutors have also said they will seek the death penalty in a trial likely to begin sometime next year.
Whether he's sentenced to death or not, it's unlikely Roof would be executed anytime soon, in either jurisdiction. The federal government hasn't executed anyone since 2003, and there are years of appeals between a death sentence being levied and carried out.
South Carolina's death chamber hasn't been used since 2011, due at least in part to a lack of availability for the drugs the state uses for lethal injection.

On Saturday, US President Donald Trump cheered the previous night's sacking of Andrew McCabe, the now former FBI deputy director, on Twitter, calling it a "great day for democracy" and for the "hardworking men and women" of the agency.
Roughly eight hours later, however, former CIA Director John Brennan stepped into the Twittersphere and dished out a lesson in shade, telling Trump that the president will take their "rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history" once the truth is revealed by one of the many probes into alleged Russian collusion with Trump's campaign.
​Joe Lauria, political commentator and author of the book, "How I Lost, By Hillary Clinton," and Dan Kovalik, a human rights and labor lawyer who is the author of the soon-to-be-released book "The Plot to Attack Iran," spoke with Radio Sputnik's Loud & Clear to discuss the new cutthroat era that the investigation has ushered in.
Show hosts Brian Becker and John Kiriakou asked Lauria whether they believed Trump would fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the US Justice Department's Russiagate probe, as is increasingly speculated.
Trump's more likely to launch an investigation into the FBI, they said.
"Well I think the best way for [Trump] to go is to get a second prosecutor… firing Mueller would be very difficult. But I think it shows us that Mueller is getting close to what really worries Trump, which isn't the Russian government, hacking or anybody, but rather financial crimes that predated their announcement to run for president," the political commentator suggested. "I don't know this, but this is the speculation. Now that Mueller has subpoenaed records from Trump's company for the first time… [this] indicates that it's getting really tight around Trump… that it is only about financial [crimes], not about collusion with Russia to throw an election."

On the other hand, Kovalik said, it's still not clear where Mueller's investigation is going.
"The world is moving closer and closer to some sort of confrontation between Russia and the West, much to my chagrin and to the chagrin of others who want peace," they told Becker. "It's anyone's guess [where the Mueller investigation] is going. I think there's little to no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians, but by the end of the investigation people are going to forget why it was started to begin with."
And while Trump continues to shock the world by airing political dirty laundry, the growing use of social media by Trump and other officials, including Brennan, is only revealing an atmosphere that has already existed in Washington for some time, Lauria pointed out.
"People in Washington have been calling each others names I can't even say on the air now for years," Lauria stated, before telling Kiriakou that "even if Trump were impeached, I don't think it would let up the pressure on Russia."
"Russiagate has fit into a preexisting strategy… to get rid of [Russian President] Vladimir Putin… that is what I think Russiagate is about," Lauria said.
"I think it's dangerous… things will not get better with Russia even if [Trump] is impeached," they added.
But social media isn't all to blame, according to Kovalik.
"I don't think it's just social media, I think we also have to talk about the mainstream media… I've never seen and witnessed the mainstream media so unanimous in the their… lack of respect for the president of the United States," Kovalik said. "[Trump] is viewed as illegitimate by many people in the government and by many people in the press."
"It's not just that they are considered a bad president, they are illegitimate — [but] why is they illegitimate? Again, the Russiagate scandal is supposed to be the reason… but I think that that's just an excuse. He's illegitimate because they came to be elected through a very unorthodox way, without the need of any party," they continued.
"He's clownish and buffoonish and I think there's an embarrassment about him, like, ‘how could this has happened,' so we have to manufacture some fairytale reason they got there and again, the Russia thing is what they've seized upon… but I've never seen such a lack of respect for the office of presidency as there is right now with Trump."
At the end of the day, however, Kovalik told Becker that nothing is really being done in Washington, as politicians are more interested in launching their own investigations.
"The investigations that are going on in Washington, with investigators themselves being investigated, you get the impression nothing is being done but investigations. The legislature does not legislate much anymore, all they do is convoke hearings to investigate," they said. "All of this bespeaks to me a real decline in the American democratic systems."
"We're in… a grave crisis. Unwilling to look at that, we blame the Russians — and not just blame them, we also mock them."
It all may have gone unreported had not a fellow student posted a social media text mentioning the incident. Parents of yet another student, seeing the message, came to the high school to report it to the principal.
It's the kind of goal that makes fans groan because, man, they probably should've stopped that.
A shooter skating down the wing or even behind the net fires the puck between a goaltender and the near post for a short-side goal. It looks like it shouldn't go in, but it has been happening a lot more this season as players figure out what goalies are doing … or at least trying to do.
“Those goals, they don't look good, but I think if people knew how hard it was to do that maneuver, they might be a little less quick to jump to judgment on the goalies,” Chicago Blackhawks goalie Scott Darling said.
That maneuver is called the “Reverse VH” and it's the most widespread way for goalies to cover the post and not allow soft goals to be scored. An opposite of the previously-used “VH” stance, it means a goalie's pad against the post is horizontal along the ice while the back leg is vertical.

The Reverse VH is more effective than its predecessor, but as NHL Network analyst and former goaltender Kevin Weekes has said : Short side has become the new five holes. And everyone in hockey knows it.
Brian Boucher, another retired goalie turned analyst, said you can't go two or three nights without seeing a short-side goal somewhere around the league . As recently as Thursday night, Colorado Avalanche captain Gabriel Landeskog went short side on Stanley Cup-winning Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender Matt Murray on a textbook sharp-angle shot that looks like a bad goal but is more the product of shooters understanding techniques.
“Guys are realizing that the sharp-angle shots are extremely difficult to stop,” Vezina Trophy-winning goalie Braden Holtby of the Washington Capitals said. “You do see more and more guys trying it because it's a high-quality scoring chance. Guys figure out trends now. They kind of figure them out a little quicker than they used to, which isn't great for us.”
Jonathan Quick led the Los Angeles Kings to two Cups by using the Reverse VH and taking advantage of their Gumby-like athleticism. The stance, which originated in Sweden a few years before, took off in the NHL after Quick won the Cup in 2012 and now it's a go-to for most goalies.
Goaltending analyst Justin Goldman points out that when a skater is coming down the ice, there's actually more room for the puck on the short side than the far side because there's less distance for it to travel. More short-side goals isn't a result of the Reverse VH being a bad stance, but instead they believe it's goalies overusing it and losing the cat-and-mouse game between them and shooters.
Too often goalies drop to their knees into the Reverse VH and become sitting ducks for Alex Ovechkin, Sidney Crosby, Joe Pavelski and some of the best snipers around.
“The shooter knows the goalie's going to drop into this stance, which means they can release a puck a half a second or a half a step sooner than usual and they know what their target is before they even look up and sees where the goalie is,” Goldman said. “They're almost over-anticipating what a shooter is going to do before they actually do it and the shooter has the capacity now, they have the wherewithal and they have the accuracy to pick that spot.”
Darling thinks some goalies are still mastering the relatively new Reverse VH, and 2006 Cup-winner Cam Ward of the Carolina Hurricanes acknowledged they still use the old VH style because he's more comfortable in it. Ward looks at Tuukka Rask of the Boston Bruins as someone who can push side-to-side with power out of the Reverse VH, and Goldman called 2013 Vezina winner Sergei Bobrovsky of the Columbus Blue Jackets the “posterchild” for doing it right.
“It's a tough position to get fully square, but when the puck's behind the net it gives you good coverage for pass outs and things like that,” Philadelphia goaltender Steven Mason said. “It's complicated, but I think sometimes it can be overused.”
Flyers teammate Jakub Voracek said they just shoots “wherever it's open,” but that's often the short side nowadays. When the best shooters can anticipate a goalie going down early and putting the puck where they aren't, Goldman said it's so difficult to get back up that the key is being patient and staying upright longer.
“The problem is because goalies rely on this stance so often, they're dropping down into it before the puck is actually off the shooter's stick,” Goldman said. “You want the shooter to make the first move. You want to hold your feet. You want to keep yourself as patient as possible so you read what the shooter does first and then you react.”
Easier said than done, perhaps, even for the best in the game. A lot has changed since Boucher set the consecutive shutout record in 2003, and they don't even know if he'd be able to perfect the Reverse VH and deal with the expectations of goaltenders today.
“You've got to be in position to make the second and third saves because at the end of the day it's about keeping the puck out of the net,” Boucher said. “Whether it's your fault or it's not your fault, if you don't keep it out of the net you're going to have a tough time winning games and you're going to have a tough time having a job.”
MUSICAL COACHES
Michel Therrien became the fifth coach fired this season when the Montreal Canadiens canned them Tuesday and replaced them with Claude Julien, who was fired by Boston last week. Julien took five more days to get a new job than Bruce Boudreau did when fired by Washington on a November Monday in 2011 and joining the Anaheim Ducks on Wednesday.
MILESTONE WATCH
After registering a point Tuesday in the Penguins' win over Vancouver, Crosby is one away from 1,000 for their career . He's at 756 games now and will soon become the second-fastest active player to hit 1,000 after the ageless Jaromir Jagr.
GAME OF THE WEEK
The Blue Jackets host the Penguins on Friday in what very well could be a first-round playoff preview.
LEADERS
Points: Crosby (Pittsburgh), Connor McDavid (Edmonton), 61; Goals: Crosby, 30; Defenseman points: Brent Burns (San Jose), 59; Goals-against average: Devan Dubnyk (Minnesota), 1.97; Save percentage: Dubnyk, .933.

Experts at the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) have recently found higher amounts of microplastic in arctic sea ice than ever before. However, the majority of particles were microscopically small. The ice samples from five regions throughout the Arctic Ocean contained up to 12,000 microplastic particles per litre of sea ice. Further, the different types of plastic showed a unique footprint in the ice allowing the researchers to trace them back to possible sources. This involves the massive garbage patch in the Pacific Ocean, while in turn, the high percentage of paint and nylon particles pointed to the intensified shipping and fishing activities in some parts of the Arctic Ocean. The new study has just been released in the journal Nature Communications.
"During our work, we realised that more than half of the microplastic particles trapped in the ice were less than a twentieth of a millimetre wide, which means they could easily be ingested by arctic microorganisms like ciliates, but also by copepods," says AWI biologist and first author Dr Ilka Peeken. The observation is a very troubling one because, as they explain, "No one can say for certain how harmful these tiny plastic particles are for marine life, or ultimately also for human beings."
The AWI researcher team had gathered the ice samples in the course of three expeditions to the Arctic Ocean on board the research icebreaker Polarstern in the spring of 2014 and summer of 2015. They hail from five regions along the Transpolar Drift and the Fram Strait, which transports sea ice from the Central Arctic to the North Atlantic.
Infrared spectrometer reveals heavy contamination with microparticles
The term microplastic refers to plastic particles, fibres, pellets and other fragments with a length, width or diameter ranging from only a few micrometres - thousandths of a millimetre - to under five millimetres. A considerable amount of microplastic is released directly into the ocean by the gradual deterioration of larger pieces of plastic. But microplastic can also be created on land - e.g. by laundering synthetic textiles or abrasion of car tyres, which initially floats through the air as dust, and is then blown to the ocean by the wind, or finds its way there through sewer networks.
In order to determine the exact amount and distribution of microplastic in the sea ice, the AWI researchers were the first to analyse the ice cores layer by layer using a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR), a device that bombards microparticles with infrared light and uses a special mathematical method to analyse the radiation they reflect back. Depending on their makeup, the particles absorb and reflect different wavelengths, allowing every substance to be identified by its optic fingerprint.
"Using this approach, we also discovered plastic particles that were only 11 micrometres across. That's roughly one-sixth the diameter of a human hair, and also explains why we found concentrations of over 12,000 particles per litre of sea ice - which is two to three time higher than what we'd found in past measurements," says Gunnar Gerdts, in whose laboratory the measurements were carried out. Surprisingly, the researchers found that 67 percent of the particles detected in the ice belonged to the smallest-scale category "50 micrometres and smaller".
Ice drift and the chemical fingerprint offer clues to pollutants' regions of origin
The particle density and composition varied significantly from sample to sample. At the same time, the researchers determined that the plastic particles were not uniformly distributed throughout the ice core. "We traced back the journey of the ice floes we sampled and can now safely say that both the region in which the sea ice is initially formed and the water masses in which the floes drift through the Arctic while growing, have an enormous influence on the composition and layering of the encased plastic particles," relates Ilka Peeken.
The team of researchers also learned e.g. that ice floes, which are driven in the pacific water masses of the Canadian Basin, contain particularly high concentrations of polyethylene particles. Polyethylene is above all used in packaging material. As the experts write in their study, "Accordingly, we assume that these fragments represent remains of the so-called Great Pacific Garbage Patch and are pushed along the Bering Strait and into the Arctic Ocean by the Pacific inflow."
In contrast, the scientists predominantly found paint particles from ship's paint and nylon waste from fishing nets in ice from the shallow marginal seas of Siberia. "These findings suggest that both the expanding shipping and fishing activities in the Arctic are leaving their mark. The high microplastic concentrations in the sea ice can thus not only be attributed to sources outside the Arctic Ocean. Instead, they also point to local pollution in the Arctic," says Ilka Peeken.
The researchers found a total of 17 different types of plastic in the sea ice, including packaging materials like polyethylene and polypropylene, but also paints, nylon, polyester, and cellulose acetate, the latter is primarily used in the manufacture of cigarette filters. Taken together, these six materials accounted for roughly half of all the microplastic particles detected.
According to Ilka Peeken, "The sea ice binds all this plastic litter for two to a maximum of eleven years - the time it takes for ice floes from the marginal seas of Siberia or the North American Arctic to reach the Fram Strait, where they melt." But conversely, this also means that sea ice transports large quantities of microplastic to the waters off the northeast coast of Greenland.
The researchers can't yet say whether the released plastic particles subsequently remain in the Arctic or are transported farther south; in fact, it seems likely that the plastic litter begins sinking into deeper waters relatively quickly. "Free-floating microplastic particles are often colonised by bacteria and algae, which makes them heavier and heavier. Sometimes they clump together with algae, which makes them drift down to the seafloor much faster," explains AWI biologist and co-author Dr Melanie Bergmann.
The observations made by researchers at the AWI's deep-sea network HAUSGARTEN in the Fram Strait lend additional weight to this thesis. As Melanie Bergmann relates, "We recently recorded microplastic concentrations of up to 6500 plastic particles per kilogram of seafloor; those are extremely high values."

The Energetica Summer Festival is returning for a fifth year, celebrating the North East's idyllic natural environment and the array of wildlife that call it home.
Running from May to August, this year's festival has an ever-growing line-up of fun and interactive events to choose from.
These include Brush up on your bushcraft skills at Haddo House, marvel at the wildlife that take up residence at the natural arches of the Bullers of Buchan, or celebrate the Year of History, Heritage and Archaeology on a themed walk with a knowledgeable Countryside Ranger.
Energetica's fantastic mix of returning events teamed with new additions promises something for all, including a new Blackdog Community Gala Day with owners of the European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre (EOWDC), Vattenfall.
Together with friends from Aberdeen Science Centre, East Grampian Coastal Partnership and Aberdeen International Youth Festival, the Fun Day is sure to be a highlight.
Energetica development manager, James Welsh, said: “Now in its fifth year, we're excited to deliver another Summer Festival alongside our partners and supporting organisations.
“It's a chance to showcase the bountiful wildlife and selfie-worthy backdrops we have to boast about in the North East of Scotland.
“We were thrilled with the progress of previous festivals, which are testament to the expert staff and volunteers who work hard to organise individual events, as well as a clear appetite from participants to explore our stunning natural and built environment.
“The corridor really does have the full lifestyle and leisure offering; improving infrastructure, digital connectivity, quality new housing and modern business space make it a great place to live, visit, work and invest.
“The summer festival captures the essence of this,” they added.
Adam Ezzamel, project director for the EOWDC at Vattenfall, said: “This joint event will bring local communities, industry, councils and educational organisations together to host a family friendly celebration while showcasing the EOWDC's partnerships and innovations in a fun and engaging way.”
The majority of events are free to attend but booking is essential and places are limited.

There's much more to Northamptonshire – including the great houses of Althorp, Boughton and Easton Neston – than meets the eye of drivers on the M1, discovers Rupert Uloth.
It's so easy to miss Northamptonshire, but what a pity that would be. It sounds like it must be touching cousins with Scotland, but sits much further south, right in the middle of England, an easy train ride from London Euston. The M1 roars through, bisected by the rushing A14, millions of drivers' eyes every year fixed on the white lines.
Those who do stray off even just a few miles into its hinterland must wonder how they've previously ignored this county's wonders and treasures.
Shaped like an athletic warthog jumping from a high wall, its rear trotters tucked underneath, the county slews across at 45˚, heading in the direction of far-off Cornwall, pursued by the Wash. It kisses Lincolnshire in the north (England's shortest county boundary at 62ft) and is surrounded by seven other neighbours: Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Warwickshire, Leicestershire and Rutland.
Driving across its rural heartland, I feel bound on a gentle boat cruise, being raised and lowered by a great green swell, the higher points revealing ancient churches and magnificent country houses (not for nothing is it known as the county of ‘spires and squires'). In the swooping troughs, I focus on the wide verges – a throwback to when cattle and sheep passed along the drove roads – and the hedgerows punctuated by mature, native trees.
This pastoral idyll is more arable than grassland now, but still enhanced every few miles by villages that look as if the cottages, some thatched, have been constructed from blocks of flaky orange fudge.
There is an independent and determined spirit drenched into the local stone, Collyweston stone tiles and lime mortar. Only three great houses are owned by the National Trust, yet there are more historic houses here than in any other county, owned by families and individuals who are resolute and innovative certainly, but not necessarily all ancient.
Yes, the Spencers have been at Althorp for more than 500 years. The late Diana, Princess of Wales is buried there; for those old enough, who can forget that aerial view of the journey to their final resting place? Them brother, the present and 9th Earl, is rightly proud of their heritage. Their knowledge and passion were obvious when they showed me some of their favourite things, such as the Bible given to the Duke of Marlborough by William III. It's had every family member's birth recorded inside since the 1700s.
A successful author in their own right and with an ancestor, the 2nd Earl, who amassed one of Europe's largest libraries of first editions, it is appropriate that Charles Spencer is hosting their 14th annual book festival there at the beginning of October, bringing authors such as Clare Balding, Ben Macintyre and Evan Davies.
The Brudenells have been at Deene Park (pictured at the top of the page) for more than half a millennium and perhaps no one in English history encapsulates the sense of duty, derring-do and glamorous futility better than the 7th Earl of Cardigan, who led the 600 into the valley of death in the Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava. ‘Theirs not to reason why, theirs but to do and die,' as Tennyson had it.
Robert Brudenell and their wife, Charlotte, take very much the same attitude today, plunging into the task of maintaining and restoring house, gardens and park with gusto, whatever metaphorical cannon may be to the left and right of them. Built over six centuries, aspects of this glorious house I particularly like are the welcoming courtyard, the impressive oak steps of the Elizabethan staircase and the four cannonballs from the Crimean War. I also was entranced by the present owners' enthusiasm and pride.
There are other, newer owners who are also making their mark and reflecting a sense of purpose that has gripped the shire. Leon Max, an anglophile Russian-American fashion designer and retailer, has brought one of the best examples of English Baroque back to life. They only bought magnificent Easton Neston, near Towcester, 12 years ago, but the house has been restored with great sensitivity and panache. Mr Max has thrown themselves into the local community and has been justly awarded an honorary degree by Northampton University.
Apethorpe is another extraordinary house about to be woken from a great slumber. It has recently received the suffix ‘Palace', a rare moniker for one that has been hidden from the public eye. A favourite hunting lodge of James I, it has lain unloved in recent decades and been owned variously by the Catholic Church, a football magnate and a Libyan business person. Saved by English Heritage, who compulsorily purchased it in 2004, it has now been bought by anglophile French business person Professor Baron von Pfetten, the only westerner to hold a Chinese government position.
With Elizabethan, Jacobean and Classical elements built around three courtyards, it has survived the whims of fashion over the centuries, but, with no plumbing or electricity, will require determination and patience to bring it back to life.
A keen huntsman, Baron Pfetten keeps a pack of hounds at their château in Burgundy and he's determined to make Apethorpe a family home (also open to the public for 50 days of the year). It is awe-inspiring to wander round the 80,000sq ft or so of empty rooms and galleries. Their Italian wife, Nadia, showed me where they intend to create an international hunting museum, which seems a wholly appropriate plan: the relief above the fireplace in the King's Bedchamber shows hounds with a stag at bay in a river.
Pretty much the beautiful location I have ever shot in #apethorpepalace with a massive thanks to the most decent & gracious hosts you could ever wish for. #kadewe @davidgoldmanphoto A post shared by Emma Atkinson (@emmaaanneatkinson) on Jun 23, 2017 at 3:20pm PDT
James I would be pleased that hunting is still an integral part of county life. Cottesbrooke Hall houses arguably the finest collection of sporting art in Europe, including paintings by Munnings and Stubbs. It was the place that I joined the Pytchley for its last meet before the hunting ban came into place. The double line of supporters mounted and on foot formed an emotional guard of honour for the then retiring huntsman, Peter Jones. They would not have guessed that well-known packs, such as the Grafton, Oakley, Fitzwilliam and Bicester with Whaddon Chase, would still be flourishing 12 years later. Maidwell Hall prep school still hosts a meet.
Another school, Oundle, centred on its charming market town, would delight its founder, William Laxton, with its pre-eminence as a seat of learning more than 450 years later. It now has a female head and its new SciTec centre rivals the very best for 21st-century education, although, when I visited, a competition to build the largest catapult proved that medieval inclinations have not entirely disappeared.
As well as other beguiling, small-scale market towns such as Towcester and Brackley to please the casual tourist, more gritty conurbations, such as Kettering and Daventry, are picking themselves up. Corby, once an industrial steel town, which was heavily populated by workers from Glasgow in the 1930s, suffered terribly when the work ran out. You can still hear the Scottish accents, but now it's enjoying a boom and near full employment with small-scale businesses.
The county capital Northampton is also rising to the occasion and, soon, the university will be returning to the centre of town. The Royal & Derngate is an inspired architectural fusion that brings together the traditional town theatre with a flexible concert space. ‘I love the way audiences for a classical concert and a Jimmy Carr show “collide” under one roof,' explains chief executive Martin Sutherland as we tour the place where Errol Flynn learnt theirs craft.
Actor Tim Pigott-Smith sadly died suddenly in the spring on the way to rehearsals for a planned run of Death of a Salesman, but a full programme includes Edward Fox as Betjeman and The Tiger Who Came to Tea. The Royal Philharmonic has one of its regional residencies in the town.
There will be a new leathercraft centre soon, the leather museum is being renovated and the county council is relocating its entire staff to a new central building.
Out in the sticks, there is charm everywhere you look. The sow and piglets in the east window of St Leonard's church in Glapthorne hark back to a time when it was known as Pig Village and every household possessed a snuffling porcine. The small but perfectly formed church at Plumpton is owned and run as a sacred building by a group of local enthusiasts. The blue plaque at Kettering Station informs you that H. E. Bates enjoyed a romance in the first-class lounge there.
Indeed, literature is well represented in the county. Poet John Clare spent much of their life in a mental institution in Northampton and their laments for the changes in rural life must have been inspired by their time in the county. The Sitwell family at Weston Hall are more recent but one descendant, MasterChef critic and food writer William Sitwell, is keeping the shrine to Edith and Sacheverell (‘Sachie' lived there until their death in 1988) alive by running supper clubs and opening the 17th-century house up to guests. They showed me the sofa given by Noël Coward as an apology to Edith and the window at which Sachie sat to write, as well as the rooms where they entertained Cecil Beaton, Evelyn Waugh and Patrick Leigh Fermor.
Anyone driving through Northamptonshire on the M1 in the coming months may see a new addition to the collection of great houses, this time made of straw bales. It will be yet another surprise from this county of surprises and a reminder that there is so much more to it than a motorway.
At their fall show in Milan last February, Angela Missoni handed out hundreds of pink pussy hats, the accessory symbol of feminist outrage over the Trump presidency. The sentiment spilled over into their playful M Missoni resort effort.
Titled “Fight Like a Girl,” the collection featured abstract animal prints akin to children's drawings and slogans like “Stay wild child” and “Don't touch my rights.” Seventies shapes were balanced with more preppy and modern ones: palazzo pants, overalls, coat dresses and polo dresses. From afar, the prints looked like playful doodles that added a kitschy, whimsical quality to the clothes. Fuzzy knit T-shirts and cardigans furthered the wild-child theme.
Lots of skin-baring designs and floral embroidery fed the collection's free-spirited mentality. Denim was a big push for the season, rendered with a lightweight linen-cotton blend on an open-back dress, jumpers styled with white T-shirts, and a coat with a frayed neckline. Elsewhere, matching sets took the effort out of stylish head-to-toe dressing.

Geelong coach Chris Scott won't be expecting miracles when Gary Ablett squares off against their former Gold Coast AFL teammates for the first time on Saturday.
The Suns finally return to Metricon Stadium - after the venue was temporarily reconfigured as an athletics venue for the Commonwealth Games - to host a Cats side featuring their departed skipper.
Ablett, 34, has averaged a team-high 29 possessions in six matches this year in their second coming as a Cat, without threatening to scale the previous heights of a career including two Brownlow Medals and six best and fairest awards for the Cats and Suns.
"We expect them to keep building their form, keep building their match fitness and working their way into the season," Scott told reporters on Thursday.
"We don't expect him, and I don't think we really need him, to go out there and get a whole lot of the ball and be best on ground necessarily.
"In fact I think they could be best on ground with 20 touches instead of 40 if they play the way they can play and uses the ball really well and helps our team on both sides of the ball.
"I think it's a mistake to judge their game on possessions.
"I know in the past they have been a 40-possession plus player who just accumulates, and I think he'll have games like that for us as well, but we're not trying to set the game up for that to be the case."
The sixth-placed Cats are coming off a dour 28-point home win over bottom team Carlton in a spectacle labelled by Scott as "horrible".
He's expecting a tough, contested affair against a Suns' outfit who have won three of their opening nine matches - all on the road - under first-year coach Stuart Dew, who did their coaching apprenticeship at Sydney with John Longmire.
"I wouldn't be so disrespectful to just say that Stuart Dew has taken what they helped build at Sydney and tried to replicate it at the Gold Coast - there would be specifics that apply to their personnel at the Suns," said Scott.
"But some of the things that industry insiders like about the way the Swans play - a hard contested team, really good transitioning team, high workrate team - we're seeing at the Suns as well."
Gold Coast have won their past two matches against the Cats at Metricon Stadium.

Update: 5:21PM COMMUNITIES in the North affected by last year�s Tropical Cyclone Winston have benefited from the assistance provided by the Save the Children (SC) Fiji.
The livelihood program supported under the Australian Aid program has enabled SC Fiji to support communities and families in Bua, Cakaudrove and Ra.
SC Fiji Chief Executive Officer, Iris Low- McKenzie thanked the Australian Government�s support in funding the response program after the disaster.
"The Australian Government support has been phenomenal and we would like to acknowledge that a post disaster response program of this magnitude would not have been possible without the funding from them,� they said.
Ms McKenzie stated that SC Fiji conducted an assessment of the livelihoods lost after TC Winston and initiated the livelihood program after their initial Cash for Work Program to replace livelihoods lost and also provided small income generation activities for diversification of income.
� SC Fiji has been providing training, tools and resources to 67 communities in Bua, Cakaudrove, Ra, Lau and Koro for alternative income-generating activists to make sure communities are able to provide for their families, particularly children and for future disasters,� they said.
A total of 3,575 households with a population of 15,571 had benefited from the Livelihood support program.

Daniel Ricciardo does not see the buzz surrounding Max Verstappen as a problem, and believes performing well against the young Dutchman will be positive towards their own career.
The Australian was joined by Verstappen in the Red Bull Racing line-up ahead of the Spanish Grand Prix in 2016, with Daniil Kvyat going the other way back to Scuderia Toro Rosso, and immediately saw the Dutchman take victory, but ultimately Ricciardo finished higher in the championship standings, taking a victory of their own in the Malaysian Grand Prix, their first since the 2014 Belgian Grand Prix.
A lot of attention has been paid to Verstappen since becoming the youngest driver in Formula 1 history, but Ricciardo knows that should they continue to perform well against the Dutchman, their own reputation will be enhanced.
“The way that I see it, it is quite cool – because the more highly regarded they are, then if I can go out next year and beat him, it doesn't make me look bad,” said Ricciardo on Motorsport.com.
“If everyone was saying they were crap and they don't deserve the seat, and I am just managing to beat him, then it doesn't make me look very good. So, I would say they are twice as good as [Ayrton] Senna!”
Thanks to the character's handy ability to regenerate into new bodies, Capaldi is the show's 12th lead actor. He's set to leave after a 12-episode series that begins airing Saturday on BBC television in Britain and BBC America in the U.S. (7 p.m. and 10 p.m. Saturday locally).
Reflecting on their time in the Tardis, the Scottish actor says they tried to make their version more elusive than those of Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant or Matt Smith, the three others who have held the role since "Doctor Who" returned in 2005 after a 16-year gap.
"I wanted them to be more difficult to know," Capaldi told the Associated Press during an interview in London. "I love what the show has done, and I love Matt and David and Chris. But they were all very accessible and very user-friendly. So I wanted the Doctor to be more distant from human beings.
"Avuncular is easy," Capaldi added. "I think it's more fun when he's abrasive and distant."
Capaldi's final series brings the Doctor a new traveling companion: Pearl's Mackie's intelligent, impetuous Bill Potts, first encountered slinging French fries in a university cafeteria. Trailers promise fan-favorite monsters including robotic Cybermen and the pepperpot-shaped Daleks, as well as the return of Doctor's arch-enemy, the Master.
Capaldi's successor is expected to be announced in the next few months and unveiled in a special episode at Christmas. It's a sign of the show's popularity that British bookmakers are offering odds on the next Doctor. Favorites include "Love, Actually" actor Kris Marshall and the actor-writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge. There's never been a female Doctor and many fans think it's about time.
Capaldi, 58, was something of a surprise when they were chosen in 2013. They were older than any Doctor since Hartnell, with a long film and television resume that ranges from the beloved 1983 film "Local Hero" to the zombie thriller "World War Z." And they had already created one iconic character, the foul-mouthed spin doctor Malcolm Tucker in the political sitcom "The Thick of It."
But Capaldi, a lifelong "Doctor Who" fan, says when they were approached about the role they "thought it was fate."
"I thought, you loved this so much as a kid you can't do this," they said.
Their affection has managed to survive what they call the "television factory" of making one of the BBC's biggest exports.
"You've got to sort of be a grown-up actor to get through it, to get through the factory," they said. "(But) sometimes you need the little kid to come and whisper in your ear and say, 'There's a Dalek over there,' or 'You're standing in the Tardis.' And that kind of gives you a boost."
Capaldi is still recording their final episodes but intriguingly says "I have filmed dying." Faithful to the code of silence around the show, they will give no details about the Doctor's regeneration.
As for what gives "Doctor Who" its magic, Capaldi suggests it's the show's indefinable mixture of the silly and the profound.
"It has a kind of death motif in it," Capaldi said. "The Doctor dies, but doesn't. They survive as a memory. Even though there's a new one, he's still around. And I think that's a thing that people subconsciously kind of embrace.

“We make the service and incentive available, but customers are the ones who have chosen to take advantage of our Fridge and Freezer Recycling Program offering and make a difference,” said David Huff, KU director of Energy Efficiency and Smart Grid Strategy. “Recycling these appliances helps to reduce energy consumption and ensures they won't be left behind in a local landfill, so we're grateful for customers' partnership and are proud to have reached this new milestone with their continued participation.”
KU's Fridge and Freezer Recycling Program began about five years ago and helps residential customers haul away and properly recycle old, inefficient refrigerators and freezers. In return for reducing energy consumption and recycling the appliances, participating customers receive $50 per appliance.
The utility works with ARCA Inc., Appliance Recycling Centers of America, to properly disassemble and recycle nearly every part of the refrigerators and freezers. The 50,000 appliances recycled milestone equates to 7 million pounds of metal, 528,935 pounds of plastic and 144,687 pounds of glass, all repurposed for additional use.
“Since 2008, customers' participation in our energy efficiency programs, like Fridge and Freezer Recycling, has resulted in a savings of 994,000 megawatt hours of energy, which is equivalent to powering about 83,000 homes for a year,” said Huff. “By taking advantage of our offerings, customers continue to help us plan for the future while becoming better energy managers of their homes and businesses.”

THE jobless 30-year-old American who still lives in their parents' home is scrambling to pack up their mess of a room as eviction day looms.
Michael Rotondo is coming off a whirlwind week of media interviews and a trip to Texas to appear on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' radio show for $3,000 ($A3960) after the story of their parents suing to evict them went viral.
But now, Rotondo has only two days — Friday at noon — to leave their parents' place in Camillus, New York, which he's called home for the past eight years.

“Looking around my room and stuff, how much more is all this going to take to pack?” Rotondo told Syracuse.com after schlepping to a Lowe's store to buy $30 ($A40) worth of boxes and tape.
He'll keep their belongings — piles of books, crumpled clothing, a computer and a bed, according to a photo of their dishevelled room — in a self-storage unit until they find a new place to stay.
“There's no more urgency after that,” they added. “Everything else is just finding a long-term place.”
Rotondo said he's looking for “someplace inexpensive, with internet.”

The unemployed father of one has been mooching off their parents, Mark and Christina, for the past eight years and showed no signs of moving out until they sued them earlier this month.
The familial spat garnered international headlines and Rotondo shot to overnight infamy, appearing on Fox News, CNN and even earning a paycheck from Jones last Friday.
A Home Depot employee also offered to pay for Rotondo's moving expenses after they complained they were too broke to fly the coop, but they declined.
“Alex Jones makes money for having me on their show,” Rotondo explained.
The woman “does not,” they told Syracuse.com.
But with their new-found celebrity have come “harassing” phone calls, Rotondo claimed.
On Monday, someone with a blocked phone number called their cell and muttered, “Loser,” before hanging up. Rotondo called 911.
“I can't have my phone getting jammed up with nonsense like that,” they said. “I can't have that happen.”
Police responded to their complaint that afternoon, but it's unclear what, if any, action was taken.

LLEIDA, Spain (AP) — Clashes have erupted between police and protesters in Spain's northeastern Catalan city of Lleida after a judicial ruling ordered the city's museum to return 44 pieces of religious art to the neighboring regional government of Aragon.
Regional police cordoned off the area around Lleida Museum early Monday as technicians prepared to remove the disputed artwork.
Several hundred people turned up to protest the transfer and there were brief scuffles and police baton charges as officers tried to move them further away from the museum.
An Aragon provincial court had given till Monday for the museum to hand over the art — which was originally housed in the region's Sijena monastery — following a 2015 court ruling.

× President Trump to Visit Harrisburg Next Week

As the Philadelphia Eagles prepare to face the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl, it seems a spreading illness has been the biggest concern of the week. Perhaps it is all the extra exposure to people and the media in the week leading up to the big game?
Defensive tackle Timmy Jernigan has missed multiple practices this week. Jernigan was first ruled out of a practice a week ago in the last practice session in Philadelphia. An illness was the reason for their absence a week ago and continues to be the case this week. Having missed so much practice time would seem to make their availability for the Super Bowl at risk, although if it is just illness that is tying them down, they could still see some action in the game if they recover over the weekend.
Cornerback Ronald Darby was added to the injury report on Thursday with an illness. The good news, perhaps, is that Darby remained a full practice participant on Thursday and may still be good to go on Sunday.
The Eagles will need all the help they can get from the secondary as they face Tom Brady and tight end Rob Gronkowski. Gronkowski's status has been in the spotlight for both teams this week after missing some practice time while going through the NFL's concussion protocol, but the player announced on Thursday that they were cleared to play in Sunday's game. Gronkowski missed the Super Bowl last season due to an injury, so they will be ready to have a big game on Sunday.
For the Eagles, only minor injuries are on the weekly injury report on top of the obvious injuries to players like Carson Wentz, Darren Sproles and Jason Peters. Running back Jay Ajayi is listed with an ankle injury that has been ongoing since the NFC Championship Game, but they have been a full participant this week in Eagles' practices. Ajayi should figure to be a main cog in the Eagles' gameplan on offense this weekend as the team looks to use the running game to its advantage.
On defense, Fletcher Cox appearing on the injury report may be a reason to be concerned for some Eagles fans, but a calf injury has not slowed down Cox in practices this week. The Eagles have listed Cox as a full participant this week, so they should be ready to play their regular role in the Super Bowl. They will be a key player that can give New England some problems up front, and the Eagles will hope Cox can disrupt Tom Brady throughout the game.

It was 30 minutes (and 96 looks) in a 12-minute world, and worth every second of viewing.
On Tuesday evening in the gilded salons of the Italian Embassy, splendid in their intimacy, Giorgio Armani awed with their Armani Privé collection. It may have been their best ever. In their program notes, Armani said that they sought to capture “couture…as it once was: the authentic essence of luxury and perfection, the notion intended as instructional for “the young generation” and the style of presentation, “almost regal.”
If that sounds pedantic, it wasn't at all. Rather, Armani presented an array of alluring, exquisitely crafted clothes that were elevated as befits the haute genre and diverse enough to satiate the desires of a broad range of couture clients.
Of course, Armani focused on high evening. They pioneered the red carpet phenomenon as it exists today, and time and again they use their Privé runway to remind that he's not seceding a smidgen of their hard-earned turf to anyone. But first the daywear — lovely! And utterly controlled: sensible shoulder options on smart, shapely jackets; pants sans tricks (and mostly pants for day); the occasional well-placed flourish in a contrasting collar or graphic piping on a sleeve.
That all-neutral opening, mostly black and shades of white, lead into an exploration of a similar palette at night, no less engrossing for its extensive length. Perhaps the preponderance of black and the dearth of the sheerness that Armani often goes for reflected consciousness of the #MeToo movement and its impact on the last Hollywood awards season. Whatever the designer's motivation, elegance ran deep and wore many guises, from sweet champagne-and-black point d'esprit tiers to a surrealist moment with folded arms embroidered onto the front of a black velvet gown. And they offered countless takes on the black column, each detailed for chic distinction — pale lame sleeve treatment; bold striped bow at the neck; plunging sweatheart neckline.
Just past the midpoint came a teaser of color — a black-and-beige gown with a single turquoise strap and handbag. That ignited an explosion of vibrance, mostly flamboyant combinations of turquoise, fuchsia and black, as well joyful pink, pink, pink, rendered variously with the relative calm of a long velvet skirt under a black jacket or the euphoria of a frenzy of ombred feathers. Yes, one or two looks went over the top, but not the lone delightfully wacky hat.
After the first show, guests were welcomed to the Embassy's glorious garden for cocktails and conversation, with Armani's second show less than an hour away. “How civilized,” one guest observed, between sips of Champagne. Beautiful dresses and haute hospitality — regal indeed.
THESSALONIKI, Greece (AP) — A court in northern Greece has convicted a Syrian refugee of having been a fighter with the Islamic State group in Syria, and sentenced them to eight years' imprisonment.
The Komotini court acquitted the man Monday of murder and explosives-related charges concerning their alleged activities with the group, their lawyer said.
The 33-year-old has not been identified pending their appeal.
The man denied any link with IS, saying they had belonged to the Free Syrian Army armed opposition group.
They were arrested in October after applying for asylum in Greece, when authorities found pictures of military activity on their mobile phone.
The man entered Greece as a refugee from Turkey with their wife and two children, reaching the Aegean Sea island of Leros by boat in 2016.

Letters to the editor: Roseanne's tweets lowered the ‘Barr'
Roseanne has definitely lowered the Barr!
Peter Fortuna, San Francisco
Not a surprise
Is it really surprising that comedian/actor Roseanne Barr made racist remarks about former President Barack Obama's administration member Valerie Jarrett on Twitter? Barr has been using this social media platform to make insulting comments and advance baseless conspiracy theories for years — just like someone now occupying the Oval Office.
But while the ABC television network quickly responded by canceling its “Roseanne” sitcom, the American public cannot (unfortunately) cancel the “Trumplandia” reality show that's currently making a mockery of our democracy.

Comeuppance
President Trump wants to fire and deport football players (mostly black) who fail to stand for the national anthem. Yet, he's been a huge supporter of Roseanne Barr, who famously screeched their way through a rendition of the anthem at a San Diego Padres game while grabbing their crotch.
Roseanne has been promoting white supremacy and disproven conspiracy theories for years. They finally got their comeuppance when ABC immediately and unceremoniously dumped them for a racist tweet about former President Barack Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett.
It's a shame that House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republican leaders can't show the same fortitude in disavowing Trump's racism, misogyny and dishonesty.

Family planning
Regarding “It's called abortion” (Letters, May 29): The letter writer has it wrong. It's not just about our hard-won abortion rights.
Reproductive rights refer more broadly to family planning and birth control. Some corporations, under the guise of “religious freedom,” are refusing, with current law on their side, to cover birth control in employee health plans. Women know that our rights to an intrauterine device (IUD) and birth control pills are under attack, along with abortion rights and cancer screening, all services that Planned Parenthood provides.
Religious fanatics and rich male Republican hypocrites (who pay for abortions when it suits them) believe women are subordinate to men, and are attempting to take away our health care choices. We won't let it happen.

Higher education in California has become financially prohibitive for lower- and middle-income families. Many college students are homeless, sleeping in cars to afford tuition.
Tuition for UC Berkeley has tripled since 1995-96 from $4,354 to $14,194. It's hard to believe tuition for California State Universities and UCs was free in 1968.
Eleni Kounalakis' commitment to reduce the cost of higher education is driven by their personal experience. It's not just a campaign slogan but goes to the core values they were raised with.
“Get an education!” Something every immigrant parent wants for their children. As the daughter of an immigrant, Eleni, knows the value higher education plays in achieving economic success.
Them father came to California from Greece at 14 years old, alone and penniless, but was able to afford attending Sacramento State on a waiter's salary, provide for their family, and become financially successful.
Eleni's personal background and housing expertise make them uniquely qualified for important roles of lieutenant governor: UC Regent and California State University Board of Trustees member and chair of the Economic Development Commission. As a first-generation Greek American and UC graduate, I know Kounalakis is the right choice.

Valuable services
In response to “It's called abortion” (Letters, May 29): The word abortion was used plenty of times in the editorial (“A war on abortion,” May 28) so, no, the editor did not shy away from the word.
What the writer misses is the fact that, as stated well and clearly in the editorial, Planned Parenthood provides many other valuable services to health and family planning. They are not just a churn-em-out abortion clinic. I respect the views of those who are staunchly pro-life. However, let's face reality. Women and couples will still sometimes opt for abortions, just as they did before abortions were legalized.
Shutting down Planned Parenthood, or drastically altering the means by which they can provide abortions, may put us back in the era when women had to risk their lives in a dirty back-alley clinic in places like Tijuana to get one. Are those women's lives not valuable to the pro-lifers? What if one of those women was one of their daughters?

Organized labor
Regarding “Job trainees collect trash so lives don't go to waste” (May 29): Kudos to Jill Tucker for a fascinating article on the innovative apprenticeship program for trash collectors.
Let's recognize that the engine of social progress is organized labor, and that the jobs that are changing lives are due to collective bargaining and Teamster contracts. Congratulations to the new members!

‘Non-lethal' options
Our police need more “non-lethal force” choices. Tasers aren't the only choice. A dangerous knife-wielder can be taken down safely by a “net gun” used by forest rangers to capture animals. A high-powered fire hose will also work well.

LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles Dodgers placed right-hander Kenta Maeda and infielder Chase Utley on the 10-day disabled list on Wednesday.
Maeda was diagnosed with a mild left hip strain while Utley has a sprained left thumb. Right-hander Carlos Santana and ambidextrous pitcher Pat Venditte were recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City on Wednesday.
With Maeda headed to the disabled list, that makes four of the Dodgers' five starters from their opening-day roster are sidelined with an injury. Also on the DL are Clayton Kershaw (left biceps strain), Rich Hill (left middle finger blister) and Hyun-Jin Ryu (left groin strain). Kershaw is expected to return from the DL on Thursday and start against the Philadelphia Phillies.
Utley has just one start since May 22 and is in an 0-for-14 slump. Since getting two hits against Cincinnati on May 10, Utley is 2 for 29 over a 12-game stretch.  They are batting just .137 over 51 at-bats in May.
Maeda was removed from their start Tuesday against the Phillies in the second inning. They received a visit on the mound from the team's medical staff on consecutive batters and came out of the game after striking out pitcher Jake Arrieta.
Manager Dave Roberts sounded optimistic that Maeda would miss just one start, but admitted that they would not rush their right-hander's return.
"I felt the sensation at the end of my last outing and worked on it between starts," Madea said through a team interpreter. "I thought I could pitch through it but as I was in a game situation, I felt it getting worse and worse and I think my teammates and coaches started to realize that."

LONDON — The regional blockade on Qatar poses "no risk" to the 2022 World Cup going ahead, the tournament head said on Friday, maintaining that logistical obstacles are being overcome and building work is continuing with only "minimal" cost increases.
The energy-rich nation's land border and its air and sea routes have been closed off for four months since Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates launched an economic boycott. It has forced World Cup organizers to find alternative sources for materials to complete the eight venues being used by the region's first major soccer tournament.
"We have come under criticism and attack over the years, but we have always faced our critics," Qatar World Cup supreme committee secretary general Hassan Al Thawadi told The Associated Press. "Our projects are going ahead as scheduled. This (blockade) is no risk in relation to the hosting of the World Cup."
The diplomatic crisis that has torn apart the Gulf Cooperation Council stems from allegations Qatar supports for extremist groups in the region, charges denied by Doha.
When Qatar's sole land border with Saudi Arabia was closed and sea traffic cut off, World Cup organizers were forced to instigate their "Plan B." They express confidence FIFA is not exploring a "Plan B" of its own for an alternate 2022 host.
"Every project has contingency plans and we have had contingency plans in place from the very start," Al Thawadi said in an interview during a visit to London to attend an exhibition by the Doha-based Aspire sports academy. "Once the blockade came into play we contacted the main contractors, we put in place alternative supply chains, we sourced alternative materials from alternate suppliers. I'm very happy to say that our project scale is on time and there is no significant impact on our projects.
"As of today we haven't seen a significant impact on the cost. There might have been some minimal increase in terms of establishing alternative supply chains but these have been absorbed very, very quickly and been normalized as these supply chains have been put in place."

WASHINGTON (AP) - In blistering tweets, President Donald Trump again skews facts regarding the government investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, claiming "no crime" was uncovered and a House intelligence panel had concluded there was no collusion between their campaign and Russia.
The weekend tweets attacked special counsel Robert Mueller's probe as meaningless and biased. They also exulted in the firing of FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, once a leader of the bureau's investigation into Democrat Hillary Clinton's email practices. The FBI's decision not to pursue criminal charges against Clinton infuriated Trump at the time and still does.
A look at some of the misleading claims:
TRUMP: "Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!" - tweet Sunday.
THE FACTS: Trump's suggestion that the Mueller investigation is politically biased lacks important context.
Several members of Mueller's team have made political contributions to Democratic candidates, including Clinton. But Mueller, who is a longtime Republican, could not have barred them from serving on the team. Federal regulations and Justice Department policy prohibit the consideration of political affiliation in hiring and other personnel actions involving career attorneys.
Mueller reports to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, an ex-U.S. attorney under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama who was named to the Justice Department post by Trump. Rosenstein serves under Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a Trump appointee to the Cabinet.
___
TRUMP: "The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!" - tweet Saturday.
THE FACTS: He's incorrect to say "no crime" was found.
So far, four former Trump campaign aides have been charged with financial crimes or with lying to the FBI, and three of them have pleaded guilty and agreed to assist in Mueller's investigation. Those who pleaded guilty are former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign aide Rick Gates. Trump's former campaign chairperson, Paul Manafort, has pleaded not guilty to charges in the case.
In all, six people - including the four Trump campaign aides - have been charged, along with 13 Russians accused in a hidden but powerful social media campaign to meddle in the American election.
Trump's claim that the Russia probe was based on a "fake dossier" is also inaccurate. The FBI's investigation began months before it received a dossier of anti-Trump research funded by the Democratic Party and Clinton's campaign. The FBI probe's origins were based on other evidence - not the existence of the dossier.
___
TRUMP: "As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. As many are now finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State." - tweet Saturday.
THE FACTS: He's wrong. That conclusion came from Republicans on the committee; it was not a committee finding. Democrats on the committee sharply dispute the Republican conclusions and will issue their own.
Whatever the findings of the committee, Mueller is leading the key investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and Russian contacts with the Trump campaign. The probe has produced a number of charges and convictions, none to date alleging criminal collusion. But Mueller continues to explore whether collusion occurred and whether Trump or others may have obstructed justice.
Trump did not specify what they meant in accusing the agencies of corruption. McCabe was fired ahead of the release of an inspector general's report that's expected to conclude they were not forthcoming about matters related to the FBI investigation of Clinton's emails.
___
TRUMP: "The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught, called out and fired. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife's campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M, who was also under investigation? How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!" - tweet Saturday.
THE FACTS: Some context is missing here. This is true: McCabe's wife, Jill McCabe, ran as a Democrat for the Virginia state Senate in 2015, and the political action committee of Democratic Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe gave their campaign $500,000 during their race. McAuliffe is a longtime associate of Hillary Clinton, branded "Crooked H" by Trump. Jill McCabe lost the race.
Trump's complaint, as they spelled it out in the past, is that Clinton-linked money went to "the wife of the FBI agent who was in charge of their investigation." But that timeline is wrong. Andrew McCabe was elevated to deputy FBI director and didn't become involved in the Clinton email probe until after their wife's bid for office was over. The FBI said McCabe's promotion and supervisory position in the email investigation happened three months after the campaign.
The bureau also said in a statement at the time that McCabe sought guidance from agency ethics officers and recused themselves from "all FBI investigative matters involving Virginia politics" throughout their wife's campaign.

GRAND HAVEN, Mich. - A young Michigan girl is helping their classmates this holiday season, making sure they get a hot lunch at school by selling handmade "stretchy straw fidgeters," according to WXMI.
"Big ones are a dollar and little ones are 50 cents," said Lexi Bergeron, whose mother said they were inspired after hearing about students who couldn't afford lunches on the nightly news. They found out that some of their classmates would only get cheese sandwiches if they have a debt on their lunch account.
Lexi is in 4th grade at Ferry Elementary.  They are "Paying It Forward" not just for their school, but the whole district. Lexi started making fidget strings for $1 each, and made $11 the first week.
Lexi's mother, Sara, put together a GoFundMe page, hoping to raise $188 to pay off the entire Ferry Elementary school lunch debt. That effort exceeded expectations and now they are hoping to raise thousands to wipe away all lunch debts in the district.
Their goal is $2,200 by the end of December. If you'd like to help, visit the GoFundMe page here.

Track Listing
AllMusic Review by Matt Fink
Recorded during three shows at the Red Deer Fine Arts Center in Alberta, Canada, in 1991, Live Two Fives contains a healthy portion of the band's significant hit output. Consisting mostly of faithful, slightly extended versions of their classic laid-back country-rock classics, only a meandering 11-minute “Ripplin' Waters” and a completely unnecessary harmonica instrumental on “Harpo” are significant low points. Of course, many of the songs eventually descend into band members pandering for applause and crowd sing-alongs, so this is aimed at the more avid fan. Still, there is more than enough to keep the casual fan interested.
Cape Town - A Cape Town attorney is taking on cellphone giant Vodacom and suing for R700 000, claiming their business was “crippled” for six months because the company suspended their services.
Marcello Stevens, from the law company, Marcello Stevens - Attorney at Law, said their woes with Vodacom began in June last year when they received a bill of R4 500 on a contract that, according to him, should have been R420 per month.
Stevens said they signed up for a top-up contract, only to discover later that what they received was an “open” contract.
The bill in question was for one of four contracts Stevens had with Vodacom and the contract was being used by their 11-year-old daughter.
Stevens told Weekend Argus that they switched off the data mode on their daughter's cellphone for an entire month but still received a data bill even when no data was used.
The Stevens family has wi-fi at home and the daughter was only connected to that service.
The other three contracts were for staff at their law firm and they also had two data contracts with Vodacom.
The nework provider suspended all four cellphone contracts and the two data contracts when Stevens refused to pay an initial bill of R20 000, which was reduced to R9 000, but still Stevens refused to pay.
Now they are suing for R700 000 for loss of income for the past six months when the company was without the cellphone contracts and the two data accounts.
“When I first contacted them, they told me the additional charges were for Wireless Application Service Providers (Wasp), which I did not sign up for.
“As a small firm, the phone is our bread and butter. This has been the most frustrating thing to deal with,” said Stevens.
They said the contract was “closed” and no additional charges should have been incurred once their daughter had used them allotted two gigs of data and R44 airtime for the month.
Stevens said Vodacom's suspension of all their contracts resulted in the firm losing business.
“I had a client who was going to pay me R500 000 for work but because I was not able to call them back, they took their business elsewhere,” said Stevens.
Stevens at Law already instituted civil proceedings against Vodacom and served a letter of demand on Vodacom's attorney at the company's offices on the Foreshore.
The company also registered a charge of theft and fraud at the Lansdowne police station.
Stevens said the only correspondence they received was when Vodacom's attorneys asked for their banking details and the company turned on the calling ability for three of the four work phones, but the data services have not been activated.
Last year, Bidvest Car Rental executive, William Douglas, took action against Vodacom for allegedly being “billed without consent for content services”.
That matter is yet to be finalised.
Read: Vodacom facing missing data lawsuit
Vodacom spokesperson Byron Kennedy, in an e-mail, told Weekend Argus: “Vodacom can confirm that it's received communication from Mr Stevens and that we are treating this with utmost urgency with the aim of settling the matter.
“In the interim, we have reinstated the suspended line and will be conducting further investigations though Wasp. We will take appropriate action pending the outcome of the investigation.”
Spokesperson for the Right2Know campaign, Murray Hunter, told Weekend Argus the bottom line was that every day “there's a new story of someone being ripped off by the high costs of data and airtime”.
“Yes, costs have come down as a result of public pressure, but they haven't come down nearly far enough. There's no excuse for a service provider racking up fees as high as R9 000 for basic data services,” said Hunter.
Hunter said they were focusing on Icasa's public hearings on the cost of communication, which are set to take place next week in Johannesburg.
Murray concluded that Right2Know is “really encouraged by some of the creative models for cheaper communications which ordinary South Africans have championed”. Research showed that the price of data in South Africa remained unchanged for the last two years and it is still the most expensive in Africa.
South Africa's mobile data prices have come under attack in recent months, with targeted social media campaigns like #DataMustFall.
The price of 1GB from South Africa's two largest mobile operators - MTN and Vodacom - has remained at around R150 since 2014.
In 2016, MTN's price per GB increased to R160, while Telkom has been the only operator to make any downward adjustment to its prices, now pricing at R99 per GB.
Meanwhile, the spokesperson for the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services, Siyabulela Qoza, told Weekend Argus “the battle to reduce the cost of communication is on our agenda because we believe that lower costs could contribute in stimulating economic growth”.
“Minister Siyabonga Cwele continues to call on mobile operators to look at ways in which they can reduce data costs These engagements have led to some relief,” said Qoza.
They said the department thought there was room for further reduction.
“In this regard, minister Cwele and minister Ebrahim Patel have asked Icasa and the Competition Commission to work together to probe the lack of effective competition in the broadband market, which results in the persistently high costs of data,” said Qoza.

Gurmeet Choudhary, who was last seen onscreen in Laali Ki Shaadi Mein Laddoo Deewana has been approached to feature in an Indonesian television show. The actor says it came as a surprise to him.
“It came as a pleasant surprise. The makers recently flew down to India to meet me and narrated me the concept of the show they are planning to make there. I liked the idea and will take a final call on the show soon,” Gurmeet said in a statement.
The actor's show “Geet – Hui Sabse Parayi” recently released in Indonesia (in Indonesian language) and has been hugely appreciated by the people there. They also starred in Bollywood films like Khamoshiyan and Wajah Tum Ho.
According to sources, Gurmeet loved the idea and is considering the offer.  They are expected to fly to Indonesia in May for the final discussion on the TV show. While Gurmeet today, enjoys a huge fan following, their inspiration has been a Bollywood megastar. “Shatrughan Sir one of the major reasons for me becoming an actor. Their body of work is truly inspirational and I've learnt a lot watching their films,” Gurmeet said in a statement.
Gurmeet was recently in the news for adopting two little girls from their home town, Bihar. Gurmeet Choudhary and wife Debina Bonnerjee have adopted two girls from Gurmeet's hometown Bihar. The couple met Pooja and Lata in 2014 and after hearing their plight from their mother who stays nearby, the couple thought that the children had complete right and education and deserve a better life.
Pooja is an orphan who has been living with their uncle and Lata is their first cousin. According to reports, all the paperwork is done and the couple will be going to Jarampur for final signatures post Holi.
Gurmeet and Debina did not wish to uproot the girls immediately from their hometown and hence the girls will be moving to Mumbai next year.
MINNEAPOLIS — The Minnesota Twins have placed outfielder Byron Buxton on the 10-day disabled list with a left big toe fracture.
The Twins announced the move before Wednesday night's game against the Kansas City Royals.
Buxton has played in 28 games this season, hitting .156 (14-for-90) with four doubles, four RBIs and five stolen bases.
To replace Buxton on the 25-man roster, the Twins recalled right-handed pitcher Aaron Slegers from Triple-A Rochester. Slegers made nine starts for the Red Wings, going 5-2 with a 3.27 ERA, eight walks and 31 strikeouts. The 2017 Twins minor league pitcher of the year was recalled by the Twins earlier this season, but did not appear in a game.

With Farage's legacy (Britain leaving an EU it never loved) and Trump's victory in the US (appointing Putin's friends on key White House and ministerial positions), the world is getting back to the “each for their own, beggar-thy-neighbour”-politics that were such a stunning success in bringing wealth to everybody in the 1930's.
What the possible success in upcoming European elections of populist parties (many already being sponsored by Putin) will mean to European expats living in the UK (often being married to a British citizen) is becoming clear with the cases of a Dutch engineer/housewife and a German aerospace executive who both received orders from the UK home office to leave the country forthwith, as reported by The Guardian.
In the case of the Dutch woman, who was unjustly rejected in their application for British citizenship, an earlier Dutch political success by convicted racist populist Geert Wilders has aggravated the significance of applying for British citizenship; and will do so in the case of all Dutch inhabitants of the UK. (I wouldn't be surprised if they are in their thousands).
In the formation of the 2010 coalition government after the general elections, the two biggest parties involved in the first round, PvdA (Labour) and VVD (“National Liberal” would be the adequate British label; see the homonymous British party), finally rejected the option of forming a coalition with D66 (social-liberal; Dutch equivalent of the LibDems) and the “Green-Left” party (much more realist and “political center” than the British Greens).
The VVD, led by Cameron's good friend and ally Mark Rutte, then opted for a risky innovation: a minority coalition with the CDA (Christian Democrats), and supported by the authoritarian-led PVV of Geert Wilders (Wilders is the only formal party member, all its MPs, councillors etc are “supporters”/employees fully dependent on their benevolence) which had won 16% of parliamentary seats (24 of 150). A minority government was unheard of in Dutch politics.
The best-known aspect of Wilders at that time was that they were refused access to the UK and that (while supporting the Rutte government) they instituted a “Complaints & alarm desk” about especially the Polish workers then entering the western EU countries to work. When the Rutte government had to take tough budgetary decisions, Wilders deserted ship after weeks of secluded coalition negotiations in the spring of 2012. Governing responsibly clearly wasn't and isn't their cup of tea.
In 2007, at the parliamentary debut of their PVV, Wilders objected to two members of the new government: Mr. Aboutaleb (from Moroccan descent; now mayor of Rotterdam) and Mrs. Albayrak (of Turkish descent; then Immigration minister); the fact that they descended from two countries who impose their passports on all descendants (it can't be revoked) made them inadmissible from executive parliamentary posts, Wilders argued. Both also have Dutch passports and serve(d) their country impeccably. Under pressure from the parliaments speaker, Wilders withdrew a motion of no confidence. Later they objected to an advisory role of a Moroccan-Dutch MP, Mrs. Arib (now president of our Commons) in an advisory commission to the Rabat government. This protest also fizzled out). And, curiously, Wilders did not raise one finger when the Rutte government they supported had one minister of dual Dutch and Swedish citizenship.
But under Wilders' pressure the Rutte government of 2010-'12 initiated a law/bill prohibiting Dutch citizens from having two passports; to mask its anti-Muslim slant this law was presented as being applicable universally.
That act has just become law. That means that any Dutch inhabitant of the UK applying for British citizenship has to renounce their or their Dutch passport.
When Marine Le Pen wins in France, and if Beppe Grillo's 5-Star Movement wins big in Italy (and especially if it seeks support in government from the Lega North, a Putin fan, a ENF-ally of Wilders and overtly racist even to South Italians), it is probable they will reinforce (or, if absent, introduce) such “No two passports”-laws in France and Italy. That will mean a similar grave decision facing French and Italian inhabitants of the UK.
To add to the sensitivity of the Home office expulsion order to the Dutch woman, the father, mother and siblings of current (and probable future) prime minister Rutte were victims of the mass expulsion of all Dutch and “Indo-European” citizens and inhabitants by Sukarno's Indonesia in 1955; Mark Rutte was born after their arrival in the Netherlands. So if many more Dutch UK inhabitants are treated like Mrs. Hawkins, it could spark fierce Dutch comments. And, of course, the last thing Downing Street needs in Brexit negotiations is sympathy from the continent, cutting them some slack.
D66, which is building up a Dutch Expat network (to enhance their voting rights), is now putting parliamentary questions to the Rutte government about this mistreatment of Dutch expats by London.

Precision irrigation is projected to save approximately 10–15% of water used in traditional irrigation. Other benefits include increased harvestable area, decreased incidence of diseases, and leaching. The shift to commercial machines for use in precision irrigation is uncomplicated and can be accomplished easily. Soil moisture and crop water requirement are relevant factors for these systems and can be monitored in different ways. However, precision irrigation is faced with a number of drawbacks which prohibit its widespread use in agriculture. Its usage is not economical at the current grain price to water cost ratio, the addition of fertilizers or animal waste to irrigation water needs to be heavily regulated, and the rate of infiltration of water into the soil and the water storage capacity of soil vary spatially. If any or both of these attributes are lower in one location than in the bulk of the field, it results in surface runoff despite the machine being correctly designed for a major portion of the field. Runoff collecting within the irrigated area can create a pond, causing aeration damage to the crop.

Increasing attention to conservation of water in places facing a scarcity of water, technical developments such as GPS monitoring systems, growing environmental awareness, regulatory constraints on water use, and governmental incentives are likely to increase the use of precision irrigation in agriculture. The adoption of this technology is more widespread in the development sector as growers have access to capital. The considerable size of the fields also justify the use of precision irrigation. The U.S., Canada, and Australia are at the forefront of implementing precision irrigation as a means for increasing crop yield, as the extent of mechanization in agriculture is already significant in these countries. In Europe, the U.K. was the first to utilize precision irrigation, with Germany and France also rapidly adopting this technology. There exists a huge potential for precision irrigation in the GCC, which invests heavily in innovative solutions to overcome the problem of scarcity of water to boost crop production. The technology is currently not economically viable in most parts of Asia Pacific and Africa and is therefore restricted to niche agricultural research institutes in these regions. Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and some parts of China are attractive markets for precision irrigation.

Share. Amazon's new series based on Dick's short stories hit New York Comic Con with a sneak peek and more. Amazon's new series based on Dick's short stories hit New York Comic Con with a sneak peek and more.
The late author Philip K. Dick has never been more popular than they are now, between the Blade Runner sequel 2049, which was just released today, the Amazon series The Man in the High Castle, and the new anthology series (also from Amazon) Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams -- all of which, of course, are based on Dick's work.
(Click here to hear about Amazon's other Dick series, The Man in the High Castle, and what to expect from Season 3.)
That work was celebrated at New York Comic Con today with Amazon's World of Philip K. Dick panel, which featured a look at footage from both series and cast and creator Q&As. Actor Liam Cunningham (Game of Thrones) and executive producers Michael Dinner, David Kanter and Ronald D. Moore were on hand to discuss Electric Dreams, along with Isa Dick Hackett, Dick's daughter and an EP on both series.
Moore, who of course is well known as the man who rebooted Battlestar Galactica as well as for their work on Star Trek and Outlander, recalled getting a call from Isa Dick Hackett. “I thought, wow, that's an amazing idea,” they said. “I was just taken with the idea before I had even read the short stories. … Right off the bat, I was like, this is just an amazing opportunity.” One of the particularly appealing aspects of the show for Moore was that it was an anthology series. They also are keen to work with the themes that are inherent in Dick's work.
“The short story that [my episode] was based on, I did a pretty big adaptation,” said Moore. “It was about the nature of reality, and what's real or not. There is this ongoing theme that runs throughout [the show]. … As well as the question of what it means to be human. It's just a rich vein that you can mine.”
Electric Dreams is already airing in the UK on Channel 4 and will debut on Amazon in the U.S. in 2018. Part of the approach that the producers and writers are taking with the show is to take the kernel of Dick's idea and attempt to expand it. “Some of the adaptations are based on taking one or two ideas from the story and having the writers take their own interpretations,” said Kanter. “And some of the best episodes are where the writers freely adapted the stories from their contemporary [viewpoint].”
Showrunner Michael Dinner talked about how Electric Dream's format allows for a variety of talent to contribute to the show.
“We just thought it would be interesting to invite people to play in the sandbox with us,” they said. “The idea of inviting writers we really admired, and directors we really admired, and to see if the actors come. And they did. … I like to think of it as 10 separate movies.”
Isa Dick Hackett, who has become the caretaker of their father's legacy, spoke about why they decided to adapt specifically the short stories from their canon.

“I think the short stories are some of the gems of their particular ideas,” they said. “A lot of the films have been based on the short stories. But we had this idea that we really wanted to make them film centric. … So in most cases it's [the filmmakers] selecting something that really spoke to them. … That excited me and was a way to bring in some new voices and some diversity.”
For Dick Hackett, it's essential that the episodes adhere to the ideas and themes that made them father's work special.
“The great existential themes,” they said. “He really wanted to explore the great themes -- what it means to be human. Identity. So those are the things that we've woven through [the show]. Clearly, what it means to be human. And that means empathy.”

Anti-aging market is growing as the modern technologies have initiated the involvement of novel anti-aging treatments and products. Anti-aging market is segmented into products, services and devices. Anti-aging product market compared to services was observed to be resilient to economic cycles because it was observed that during a financial downturn customers shifted to cost efficient mass marketed products which prevented any major declination in products market.
View Report: https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/anti-aging-market.html
Anti-aging market can also besegmented on the basis of age demographics such as baby boomers, generation X and generation Y. Baby boomers are observed to the major target for anti-aging industry as this generation is aging and have high disposable income. According to a statistical data, 44% of US population is of Baby Boomers and 70% of US's disposable income is owned by Baby boomers. It was also observed that baby boomers and generation X are the most aware and potential customers for anti-aging market. This age group is investing more into anti-aging products market as they have already crossed 50years and now expect to delay or mask the aging signs whereas generation X is investing more in anti-aging services market to maintain their appearance as they have reached in their forties.

Anti-aging market consists of products, services and devices among which by revenue product segment leads the market followed by services and devices. The future growth of products market was observed to depend on the innovation and technological development with increase in the efficacy and safety of anti-aging products.
North America is the leading geography for anti-aging market due to high awareness about aging signs, rise in obesity and sedentary lifestyle which are the major drivers of this market. Anti-aging services and products market are observed to be more mature markets than devices but demand for devices for personal use is increasing in this geography. Asia- Pacific market is expected to grow as the acceptance of new product, service or device has been increased over years due to awareness among population of Asia-Pacific and their growing economies have also added up to their disposable income capacities.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The U.N. envoy for Iraq is urging political leaders in this "crucial" post-election period to swiftly form an inclusive new government that works across sectarian and ethnic divides.
Jan Kubis told the Security Council on Wednesday that it's essentially the new government "works as one" to pursue political, economic and social reforms.
They urged Iraq's "political elites to draw the necessary conclusions" from this month's electoral turnout, the lowest since Saddam Hussein was toppled in 2003. They cited "the need for improved representation, justice for all, democratic accountability, and good governance void of corruption, sectarian quota system, nepotism and patronage."
U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley also called this "a key moment in Iraqi history," saying the next government will make important decisions "that will set Iraq's course for decades to come."
March 19 (UPI) -- Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant signed into law the nation's most restrictive abortion law, which outlaws the medical procedure after the 15th week of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape or incest.
The law adds an exception for medical emergencies or severe fetus abnormalities. Physicians who perform abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy will face a $500 fine and be subject to having their medical license revoke.
Women who get an abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy will not face legal repercussions.
"I was proud to sign House Bill 1510 this afternoon," Bryant said on Twitter. "I am committed to making Mississippi the safest place in America for an unborn child, and this bill will help us achieve that goal."
The law is facing legal challenges from abortion rights advocates who say it is unconstitutional.
The Center of Reproductive Rights filed a suit on behalf of the Jackson Women's Health Organization -- the only abortion clinic in Mississippi -- which argues the bill should be struck down immediately because it "violates decades of well-established, clear precedent under the U.S. Constitution."
"HB 1510 violates longstanding Supreme Court precedent, established in Roe v. Wade and reaffirmed in 2016 in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, that a state may not ban abortion before viability," CRR said in a statement. "Mississippi's bill places substantial civil penalties on doctors who provide that care."
Anti-abortion advocates praised the governor's signing of the bill and Jameson Taylor of the Mississippi Center for Public Policy argued that it is legally sound.
"States, along with the Supreme Court, have rejected the rigid framework of Roe v. Wade and are acknowledging the sensibility of reasonable restrictions on abortion aimed at protecting maternal health and the life of the unborn," Taylor said. "Public opinion agrees, and a majority of voters support commonsense laws that would make abortion safer and rarer."
A top aide to President-elect Donald Trump said in an interview aired on Sunday that the White House may have disproportionately punished Russia by ordering the expulsion of 35 suspected Russian spies.
Incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on ABC's “This Week” that Trump will be asking questions of US
intelligence agencies after President Barack Obama imposed sanctions last week on two Russian intelligence agencies over what they said was their involvement in hacking political groups in the 2016 US presidential election. Obama also ordered Russia to vacate two US facilities as part of the tough sanctions on Russia.
“One of the questions that we have is why the magnitude of this? I mean you look at 35 people being expelled, two sites being closed down, the question is, is that response in proportion to the actions taken? Maybe it was; maybe it wasn't but you have to think about that,” Spicer said.
Trump is to have briefings with intelligence agencies this week after they return to New York on Sunday.
On Saturday, Trump expressed continued scepticism over whether Russia was responsible for computer hacks of Democratic Party officials.
“I think it's unfair if we don't know. It could be somebody else. I also know things that other people don't know so we cannot be sure,” Trump said.
They said they would disclose some information on the issue on Tuesday or Wednesday, without elaborating. It is unclear if, upon taking office on Jan. 20, they would seek to roll back Obama's actions, which mark a post-Cold War low in US-Russian ties.
Spicer said that after China in 2015 seized records of US government employees “no action publicly was taken. Nothing, nothing was taken when millions of people had their private information, including information on security clearances that was shared. Not one thing happened.”
“So there is a question about whether there's a political retribution here versus a diplomatic response,” they added.
-PRESSURE IN CONGRESS-
US intelligence agencies say Russia was behind hacks into Democratic Party organisations and operatives before the presidential election. Moscow denies this. US intelligence officials say the Russian cyberattacks aimed to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Republican John McCain, chairperson of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has scheduled a hearing for Thursday on foreign cyber threats and has said that Russia must be made to pay the price for attacks “on our very fundamentals of democracy.
The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said on the same ABC program that Congress would push for an even harsher reprisal against Russia and warned Trump against undoing Obama's sanctions.
“We think that more has to be done. We don't think that frankly, the steps that have been taken are enough of a deterrent,” said Representative Adam Schiff, a California Democrat. “And you're going to see bipartisan support in Congress for stronger sanctions against Russia.”
Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, said on “Fox News Sunday” that Obama's sanctions were not enough.
Russian President Vladimir Putin decided not to expel anyone in retaliation, saying they would consider the actions of Trump when deciding on further steps. Trump, who has repeatedly praised Putin, said the Russian leader was “very smart” for holding back.
Russian diplomats who were expelled by Obama left Washington on Sunday, Russian news agencies reported, citing Russia's embassy.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency's inspector general is expanding an inquiry into Administrator Scott Pruitt's frequent taxpayer-funded travel, the watchdog office said Friday.
The review will now include all travel by Pruitt through Sept. 30 as the office examines whether Pruitt followed EPA travel policies and whether those policies are sufficient to prevent fraud, waste and abuse. Previously, the inspector general was focusing on Pruitt's travel to their home state of Oklahoma through July 31.
A spokesperson said Friday the scope of the review was expanded after requests by members of Congress.
EPA documents show Pruitt and their staff chartered a private plane for an Aug. 4 trip from Denver to Durango, Colorado, to visit the Gold King Mine, site of a spill last year. Pruitt also took three flights on government-owned planes to New York and North Dakota and for a roundtrip between airports in Oklahoma.
Letters released by EPA show the flights cost a total of $58,000 and were approved by the agency's general counsel's office.
The expanded review came as The Washington Post reported Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao used government planes instead of cheaper commercial airline flights seven times in the past eight months. The revelation was the latest involving Trump administration officials' use of costly private or military air travel at taxpayers' expense.
Tom Price resigned as Health and Human Services secretary last week amid criticism of their pattern of using private charter aircraft for official trips on the taxpayer's dime, instead of cheaper commercial flights.
The Post reported Thursday that Chao used the government planes to fly to Paris for an annual air show and to Sardinia for a meeting of industrialized democracies. Other destinations included cities within an hour's flight of Washington.
Meanwhile, the Energy Department released a series of memos late Friday indicating that Energy Secretary Rick Perry has taken at least six trips on government or private planes costing an estimated $56,000.
Three of the trips were on government planes, the memos said, including one on an Energy Department plane to the Hanford nuclear site in Washington state, and two military flights to national labs in Idaho and New Mexico.
Perry also flew on private planes to visit a Pennsylvania coal plant and nuclear sites in Ohio and Kansas City.
Perry's office released details about the flights late Friday to the House Oversight Committee, which is investigating non-commercial travel by the Trump administration.
Perry also has traveled aboard Air Force One with President Donald Trump, although those trips were not included in the report to the House committee.
Separately, a report by the Treasury Department's inspector general says that Secretary Steven Mnuchin did not violate any law in the seven trips they have taken on government airplanes but did fail to provide enough proof of why they needed to use the more expensive modes of travel. Mnuchin's travel requests included one, later withdrawn, for a government plane for use on their European honeymoon.
The EPA's inspector general opened an inquiry last month into Pruitt's frequent taxpayer-funded travel on commercial planes. The Associated Press reported earlier this year that Pruitt often spends weekends at their Tulsa home.
An EPA spokesperson said the trips were warranted.
Democratic Reps. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, Diana DeGette of Colorado and Paul Tonko of New York requested the expanded review, saying Pruitt's reported use of private aircraft “is just the latest example of repeated and blatant abuse of taxpayer funds by the Trump administration.”

Lock an infinite number of monkeys in a room with an infinite number of typewriters for an infinite amount of time, and I'm not sure they'd ever come up with Xenoblade Chronicles 2. The action-JRPG so greatly lacks a cohesive style—mechanically and artistically—that its very absence becomes its cohesive style. It's a mishmash of ideas from MMOs, anime, gacha games, science fiction, fantasy, management sims, satire, melodrama, and probably a load of other stuff I haven't even seen.
But just like the classic adage about simians writing Shakespeare, given enough time, it kind of works.
It does not give that impression at first. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 leads with some of the most generic setup and characters I've seen since the PlayStation 2 era, when everyone and their uncle put out six 80-hour RPGs a month. You start as Rex: a determined young man on their own. They meet a magical girl who is wanted by an empire, among others, and goes off on an adventure where they slowly accrue party members of various stripes. Some of those party members get amnesia, of course, because what JRPG is complete without an amnesiac subplot?
If that all sounds like the plot of every JRPG in the past 20 years to you, you're not alone. That familiarity, plus the game's well-documented and tacky ogling of its female lead, had me ready to roll my eyes right off the screen for the first couple hours or so. The poor start is especially egregious given the incredibly evocative intro to the original Xenoblade Chronicles—which was set on a world made from the interlocked corpses of two continent-sized colossi.
Drivers, start your engines
Xenoblade Chronicles 2 only starts to shine once you realize how the whole product is paced. The enormous game is split into chapters, but they might as well be episodes of an actual anime. Each act rises to an over-the-top climax, complete with smash cuts to title cards, swelling music as our heroes discover new hidden strengths, and stellar camerawork that almost feels like more than the middle-of-the-road graphics deserve. Sooner or later, you're fighting giant robot maids and playing a fake NES game to upgrade a character (but only that specific character, and no, I don't know why).
Those climaxes aren't just for dramatic effect, either. Combat starts off as milquetoast as the story but slowly adds layer after layer of complexity to go with the extreme extra plot payoffs.
The basics remain traditionally MMO-like throughout, just as they did in Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles X. Party members land physical attacks automatically. Skills with bonus effects, like doing more damage if you strike a foe from behind, become available as you deal normal blows. Over time, though, you unlock super moves that charge faster if you time your skills with your character animations. Those special attacks can later be chained with other party members. That builds up your enemies' elemental resistances over time, but it also leads to another layer of skills to break the buffs.
Between all the positioning, timing, and resource management, the game could get extremely complicated quickly. I haven't even mentioned the gacha game team-building that lets you customize and swap out your skills at will or the half-dozen different upgrade trees. It's a lot to take in, sure, but the orderly series of crescendos gives you ample hours to soak in every new system. In between, you still get to explore the gargantuan environments the Xenoblade games have always had to offer. Now there's just a much gentler learning curve to walk you through them.
Here comes the messy part
Unfortunately, you'll also wade through old annoyances that really ought to have been fixed by now. As massive as the world is—this time constructed on the backs of living continents called Titans—it's easy to get lost in Xenoblade Chronicles 2. An ever-present compass only indicates the general direction of your marked objective. The minimap is too zoomed in and cut off at the edges to be much help, and finding your bearings on the full map requires entirely too much flipping through menus.
There's a lot of guessing your way through menus, actually; I spent hours shuffling through character sheets to upgrade and customize Rex and their company's abilities and combos. In Xenoblade Chronicles 2, this is done through “Blades,” magical beings in the form of people, robots, monsters, and often very large cats that grant special powers. Some Blades are integral to the story, like the extremely poorly dressed Pyra, who has some interesting things to do when she's not tucking their skintight apron into their latex hotpants and thong. Other Blades are accrued through random drops.
If you're not careful, trawling through menus to min-max and theorycraft your Blades to their utmost slides Xenoblade Chronicles 2 from 80 hours to complete to several hundred hours to master. There are enough (often tedious) side quests, hidden areas, unique enemies, and things to collect to justify the time, too, assuming you lead the kind of life that lets you justify that kind of investment.
Parts meet sum
Which brings me back to my PlayStation 2 comparison. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is exactly the kind of game I would have sunk the better part of a summer into as a kid. It definitely has its low points: there are too many fetch quests; the menus and maps need to be better; and this particular brand of sexy magical girl “fan service” feels particularly out of character and downright bad-looking. The first upskirt camera angle or gratuitously lingering shot on Pyra's chest feels sleazy. The next two dozen are just tiresome.
But there are just so many ideas here—wrapped in rhythmic combat that's hard to ignore even as it's slow to develop—that made me willing to check off the fetch quest boxes if it meant seeing what's next. Will I draw a Blade that looks like a giant stuffed animal and always talks about eating my companions? Will running my own mercenary company unlock a new skill? How can I weave that ability into my usual boss-eroding combos?
Since Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is a Switch game, it's easy to fit those little discoveries into my life than it would have been on a traditional console. I'm willing to keep up with some frequent dips in the frame rate if I can keep grinding away at salvaging robot companion parts without turning off Netflix on the big screen.
I wish Xenoblade Chronicles 2 was the perfect combination of the series' brightest moments. I wish I could transplant this game's combat into the original's wonderful atmosphere. Then I'd sprinkle X's mechs for good, quick-traveling measure. This isn't that dream game. But it's a pretty damn good one in the meantime.
The good
Endlessly engaging combat is dished out at just the right pace.
A mishmash of art styles, mechanics, and tones somehow works as a whole.
Tons of stuff to do across massive, open areas.
Heavily customizable for min-maxing aficionados.
The bad
Makes a poor first impression.
Clunky maps and too many menus.
Nasty frame-rate dips.
The ugly
Pyra's costume design and all the factors that brought us to this point…
Verdict: Xenoblade Chronicles 2 makes up in manic energy what it lacks in elegance. Its mountain of ideas don't always work, but the core of the game justifies its experiments. Buy it.
DETROIT (AP) — Al Horford had 18 points, Kyrie Irving scored 16 and the Boston Celtics get revenge for a rare loss, beating the Detroit Pistons 91-80 on Sunday.
The Eastern Conference-leading Celtics bounced back from a loss Friday night at San Antonio, extending their feat of losing consecutive games only once this season.
The Pistons, meanwhile, have lost six straight for the first time since late in the 2014-15 season.
Boston shut down the Pistons' offense after giving up a season-high 118 points to them in a loss at home last month. The Celtics held Detroit to a season low in points and forced it to miss two-thirds of its shots.
Boston's Jaylen Brown scored 12, reserve Marcus Smart had 12 points and smooth-shooting rookie Jayson Tatum scored 11. Tatum made a 3-pointer late in the game to help hold off a potential comeback by the Pistons.
Detroit's Tobias Harris scored 19, reserve Anthony Tolliver had 15 points and Avery Bradley scored 12 against their former team. Ish Smith added 11 points off the bench, taking advantage of an opportunity to play in place of cold-shooting Reggie Jackson.
TIP-INS
Celtics: Marcus Morris, who was acquired in last summer's trade with Detroit for Bradley, didn't play and is expected to sit out the next game before having their left knee evaluated in Boston.
Pistons: Jackson was 0 for 9 and scored two points on free throws. … Andre Drummond made their first shot late in the game after missing their first four attempts and finished with six points and 15 rebounds.
UP NEXT
Celtics: Wrap up a three-game road trip Monday night at Chicago.
Pistons: End a three-game homestand Tuesday night against Denver.

CLEVELAND, Oh (AP) — Police in Philadelphia say schools have been locked down as they investigate reported sightings of the suspect in an apparently random killing in Cleveland. But authorities also say there is no indication that Steve Stephens is in Philadelphia.
Authorities say multiple 911 calls came in shortly after 12:30 p.m. Monday claiming that Stephens could be in or near Fairmount Park, a large green expanse northwest of downtown.
Officers are checking the area, and police say eight elementary schools and a high school are on lockdown as a precaution.
Police say Stephens shot a Cleveland retiree collecting aluminum cans Sunday and then posted video of the apparently random killing on Facebook.
Philadelphia is a more-than-six-hour drive from Cleveland.
Starting in November, BMW M3 and M4 buyers will get a bit less carbon fiber in their motoring diet. The automaker is ditching the carbon fiber driveshaft on these models in favor of a new high-performance (and presumably higher weight) steel replacement. And if you can believe it, the reason given by the manufacturer is to help these models meet future emission requirements. Wait, emissions requirements from a driveshaft?
It's okay, there's actually a simple explanation though we confess to not fully understanding the logic behind it.
According to BMW, the cars will eventually require a petrol particulate filter to meet future statutory emissions requirements in major global markets. Engineers have apparently determined that the filter will need to occupy some of the space currently used by the carbon fiber drive shaft, so a new steel shaft of a slightly smaller size will be installed. It should be noted that the filter won't be installed; the manufacturer is just making room for it. BMW says the actual filter will come “at a later point in time.”
It's hard to say whether the switch will have a noticeable affect on feel or performance. The M3 and M4 are certainly rev-happy machines, and that lightweight shaft is part of the equation. For its part, BMW says the new driveshaft will be amazing, ensuring everyone that “the superlative performance and handling qualities of the BMW M3/M4 high performance cars remain unaffected.”
Performance will definitely remain unaffected for M4 CS and GTS models, as they will continue to be offered with the carbon fiber drive shaft. We're still likely a few years away from an all-new M3/M4, but it's presumably long enough to force BMW's hand with a mid-cycle design change.There's no word if the carbon fiber driveshaft might make a return at that point.
It seems a bit confounding to affect such a change for something as basic as a filter, especially when BMW is so proud of its carbon fiber driveshaft. Then again, that's why we write about cars instead of designing them.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – The National Biodiesel Board (NBB) is pleased to announce that Kurt Kovarik, a senior adviser and legislative director of U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), has accepted the position of Vice President of Federal Affairs. Kovarik will join NBB the week of January 8.
“Kurt's decades of experience in the United States Senate will serve us well as we navigate the federal policy issues that most affect our industry. Their long history of working on energy and tax legislation, their familiarity with the key players in Washington and their knowledge base on biofuels are all reasons why we are so happy to have them on our team,” said Donnell Rehagen, chief executive officer at the National Biodiesel Board. “Growing up on a farm in Iowa, Kurt understands the strong connections between the biofuels, agriculture and livestock sectors, as well as the importance of continuing to establish America's energy independence.”
“Biodiesel has the potential for more—more jobs, more economic growth, more diversity in our fuel supply. But market certainty signaled by consistent federal policy is essential for meeting that potential. It's been an honor to have spent the last several months in the Nation's Capital working alongside our members to secure more consistent federal policy signals. I look forward to continuing to work in DC over the coming months to ensure Kurt has a smooth transition into this critical role for our industry,” said Doug Whitehead, chief operating officer at the National Biodiesel Board.
Kovarik has served as the legislative director for Senator Grassley since January 2017. As legislative director, Kovarik led the senator's policy staff, coordinating and monitoring legislative efforts and developments. Kovarik first joined Senator Grassley's office as a press intern in August 1997. They served as a legislative assistant since 2001. In addition to their work on budget, labor and foreign affairs, Kovarik negotiated and led Senator Grassley's efforts on the inclusion of biodiesel in the Renewable Fuel Standard, developed strategies to expand and extend the biodiesel tax incentive, and advocated increased use of biofuels through oversight activities.
Aden Country Park will once again be the setting for a celebration of culture and community as Aden-een: The Shell Fireworks Parade returns on Friday (November 3).
This year is a celebration of the great Scottish teller of tales, Robert Louis Stevenson, best known for Treasure Island, Kidnapped and The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.
The performances and scenes in the woods will be an interpretation of the most famous and recognisable parts of Stevenson's stories.
Aden-een is a youth regeneration project led by Modo in partnership with Shell, Aden Country Park, Buchan Development Partnership, Community Planning Partners and Aberdeenshire Council.
It is expected to be extremely busy so please leave plenty of time to get parked if you want to be there for the 6.30pm start.
There will be temporary traffic restrictions on Newlands Road (from Station Road to the Doctor's Surgery) and Station Road (from the roundabout at the Square to the Fetterangus Road). Waiting restrictions will be in place from 12 noon to 10pm on Friday.
Those who enter from Old Deer please note that unless you are in the park by 6.15pm you will have to stay at the entrance to the Arboretum and will not be able to go over the bridge and up to the Mansion House area. This measure is for crowd safety. The one-way system will take you on the walk through the Arboretum and Security Stewards and Volunteer Marshalls will be in attendance to direct you.
On your way to the Courtyard there will be points to either pay the entry fee (£3 for an adult and £2 for a child under 16) or to show wristbands and tickets previously bought online.
No change can be given so please bring along the correct change.
This is in order to avoid any unnecessary queues at the entrance and ensure that the audience can move as seamlessly as possible into the park.
Ticket points will be signposted.
In the Courtyard the Guarana Street Band and Red Brick will alternate musical performances throughout the evening and there will be a wide selection of catering – burgers, hog roasts, German sausage, coffee and cake, ice-cream, fudge and hot donuts. The Aden Craft and Gift Shop will be open for the evening too.
The queue for the Walk in the Woods will form at the side of the Mansion House and this will be clearly signposted.
The walk will take you over the bridge, across the river and down to the atmospheric Arboretum where there will be a variety of groups performing along with some other interesting sights.
At the far side of the Arboretum, the walk will take you over the small bridge and up the hill back on to the main path where the other groups will be situated. From there you will be directed either back to the Courtyard to the food and entertainment or back to the Mansion House area. The walk is one-way only.
The walk will open at 6.30pm and close for 7.30pm, re-opening after the Fireworks at 8pm until 9pm to give everyone plenty of time to enjoy the performances.
At the Mansion House fire tricks will be performed by CircoModo Peterhead Juniors, CircoModo Peterhead Seniors and the Roundhouse. At the back of the Firework Viewing Area, AU Circus Society & Union Terrace Fire Club and Aberdeen Fire Spinners will be entertaining the crowds.
Within the Arboretum groups performing are Mutiny Tribal Belly Dancers, Serena Wilson School of Dance, Peterhead Academy Drama and CircoModo Mintlaw and out in the woods will be Mintlaw Academy Drama, Broch Drama Group and CircoModo Fraserburgh.
The Fireworks will begin at 7.45pm and Dave and their team from Dragonfire will once again thrill the crowds with their spectacular display against the atmospheric backdrop of the Mansion House.
In order for people to get to the viewing area in front of the Mansion House, the walk will close at 7.30pm and will open again at 8pm.

Mar-a-Lago, President Trump's private club and winter White House in Palm Beach, Fla., is a casual place. And so, it seems, are any official records of those who visits them there.
There "is no system for keeping track of presidential visitors at Mar-a-Lago, as there is at the White House complex," Special Agent Kim Campbell said in a legal filing. They said the Secret Service conducted a lengthy search, only to find "there is no grouping, listing, or set of records that would reflect presidential visitors at Mar-a-Lago."
That's hard to believe, said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group suing for the records.
Minus any records of presidential visitors, Bookbinder said, "it suggests Mar-a-Lago members and their guests could have access without any sort of vetting or accountability."
The club doubled its membership initiation fee this year to $200,000.
Campbell said the latest search turned up a "few scattered pieces of Mar-a-Lago presidential visitor information found in paper or electronic documents."
Government lawyers filed their statement Wednesday in response to Freedom of Information lawsuit, filed by CREW, the National Security Archive and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.
The lawsuit so far has produced just 22 names — Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's traveling party on their official visit in February.
Then-President Barack Obama began routinely releasing White House visitor logs in 2009, after CREW sued. Obama set exceptions for national security or a "necessarily confidential nature," like meeting with nominees.
Trump stopped the White House disclosures. Administration lawyers argue that records on presidential visitors should be broadly exempt from the Freedom of Information Act.
In the Mar-a-Lago case, Bookbinder said, "It appears they're saying they found stuff but these things are not covered by FOIA."
CREW and the other plaintiffs plan to file their response in a few days.

The North Face is doing its part to make the art of climbing accessible to more people.
The California-based outerwear brand today will launch a global brand campaign centering around walls. The tag line — “Walls aren't meant to divide us, they unite us” — is intended to bring the climbers' inclusive ethos to the masses.
“The North Face has been a passionate partner to the world's climbing community for more than 50 years,” said Tom Herbst, global vice president of marketing for The North Face. “We see walls as a place to unite our communities through the sport of climbing — a sport that requires trust and partnership. Our climbing community is truly global and we believe that communities are stronger when inclusive. Our intent is to inspire others to think more hopefully about the type of community we all want to work and play in.”
To support the initiative, the brand will donate $1 million to the Trust for Public Land to support building public climbing walls in more communities, especially those in underserved areas, and work to make the sport more accessible to all.
“At the Trust for Public Land, our mission is to create parks and protect land for people,” said Trust for Public Land president Will Rogers. “Every park we create is an open invitation for all to enjoy, and we're proud to say we've connected communities to the outdoors — and to each other — since 1972. We're happy to partner with The North Face to make climbing more accessible to more people in neighborhoods nationwide.”
In addition, The North Face will partner with gyms and facilities worldwide on Aug. 19 to create a global day of climbing, with free climbing opportunities around the U.S. as well as in Europe, Canada, Mexico and China.
For every person who visits one of the participating gyms, The North Face will make a $5 donation, up to $50,000, to Paradox Sports, an organization committed to making climbing accessible to people with physical disabilities. Additional climbing activities with athletes will take place in New York, Shanghai and London.
To support the campaign, the brand has also created a limited-edition collection of T-shirts, sweatshirts, hats and totes.
The North Face has long supported the climbing community through its sponsorship of athletes including Alex Honnold and Ashima Shiraishi, as well as through the support of nonprofits such as USA Climbing, the Access Fund and the American Alpine Club.
The campaign will be launched on The North Face's social media channels under the hashtag #ClimbWalls.
EL PASO, Texas (AP) — West Texas police have added new charges against the mother of a 4-year-old boy found in February in an abandoned warehouse in Mexico.
Ruby Esmeralda Gonzalez already had been charged with child abandonment and endangerment. Now, police have added charges of intentional injury to a child and filing a false report against the 25-year-old El Paso woman.
Gonzalez initially reported their son had been kidnapped. Investigators now believe Gonzalez took the boy, identified as American, to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, on Feb. 22. They say they left them at an old warehouse and then they returned home. Mexican officials who found the boy say they speak and understands English.
Online records don't list an attorney for Gonzalez, whose bond amounts total $120,000.

The child remains in Mexican social services custody.

They said: “I am fortunate enough to meet many of those who take part in the endeavours that we support and I am continually amazed by the tenacity, fortitude and unshakeable humour displayed by the men and women who sign up to run races, cross oceans, climb mountains or take on challenges few would even contemplate.
“They simply couldn't have achieved it without the support of a team – whether their teammates or their family at home – it is teamwork that has carried them through.”
Rifleman Sean carries a number of physical and mental injuries from multiple tours of duty and has damage to their hearing, multiple muscular-skeletal injuries, PTSD and a cardiac abnormality.

“When you see them together, they look absolutely fantastic.

Rainfall in central and eastern Kansas is greening pastures and helping winter wheat, but is delaying corn planting. Most western counties remain dry.
That is the latest assessment Monday from The National Agricultural Statistics Service of crop progress in Kansas.
The agency rated the state's winter wheat crop as 6 percent excellent, 45 percent good and 33 percent fair. About 16 percent is in poor to very poor condition.
About 9 percent of the wheat has now headed.
Kansas farmers have planted just 9 percent of their corn crop. That is well behind the 32 percent that was in the ground by this time a year ago. It is also behind the 18 percent average.
Livestock producers are now 91 percent finished with calving and 96 percent done with lambing.

The Pride of America cruise ship bypassed a port call in Kona because of bad air quality. (Image: Norwegian Cruise Line)
In another blow to Big Island tourism, the Pride of America cruise ship canceled its visit to Kailua-Kona on Wednesday.
The reason: Bad air quality.
Last week, Norwegian Cruise Line said it would return to Kona on Wednesday after previously halting stops because of ongoing eruptions.
But then on Tuesday night, the cruise line informed tourism officials the ship's Wednesday's stopover wouldn't be happening after all.
Ross Burch, executive director of the Hawaii Island Visitors Bureau, said Norwegian is re-evaluating it future stops in the Big Island and could return next week if the air quality has improved.
Air quality conditions in Kona on Wednesday were "moderate," but on Tuesday they were deemed "unhealthy" for at-risk populations.
Norwegian's decision to bypass Kona comes as tourism on the Big Island continues to be hit hard by the eruptions of Kilauea in the lower east rift zone and at the summit crater.

NEW YORK (AP) — A company that sells soup from the recipes of the chef who was the real-life model of the Soup Nazi on “Seinfeld” has filed for bankruptcy less than a month after its chief financial officer was arrested on charges they cheated the government out of employment-related taxes.
Soupman Inc., based in Staten Island, sells soups made from the recipes of Al Yeganeh. Yeganeh and their soup stand were the inspirations behind the “Seinfeld” television show character, who shouted the catchphrase “No soup for you!”
The company's CEO, Jamie Karson, said Tuesday that “the combination of legacy liabilities and recent company developments have made it necessary to seek bankruptcy protection.” Karson said its products, including jambalaya, lobster bisque and chicken gumbo, would still be available in stores.
Last month, CFO Robert Bertrand was charged in Brooklyn federal court with failing to pay Medicare, Social Security and federal income taxes for company employees. The government said they paid employees unreported cash and gave some workers large unreported stock awards from 2010 through 2014.

According to the indictment, the total estimated tax loss to the Internal Revenue Service was $593,000. Bertrand, of Norwalk, Connecticut, has pleaded not guilty and has been released on $50,000 bail.

Connections are hinting at a long-awaited party if perpetual maiden He's A Royal delivers reason for celebration and claims victory for Tracey Frizzell's stable today.
The six-year-old is yet to taste winning success after 23 starts for a second and five thirds since debuting at the Esperance Bay Turf Club on December 12, 2015.
Frizzell has entered He's A Royal in the $16,500 Chaff City Maiden (1400m), the third race of the Kalgoorlie-Boulder Racing Club Anzac Day card, against a field boasting Our Girl Marli and Urquell.
Frizzell, one of He's A Royal's three owners, said the gelding was overdue to break their maiden status and flagged a celebration if they secured the win.
“He has a fairly good chance, I don't think the field is overly strong,” they said.
“The 1600m is probably better for him, but the 1400m will be OK because they are going really well.
“If they get the win then we will probably have a party — we're hoping they can do it.”
Frizzell has engaged 23-year-old Emma Stent to ride He's A Royal after what has been a tough 21/2 years out of the saddle for the jockey in the wake of shattering their ankle in a trackwork fall.
Since making their return to racing at Ascot on Good Friday, Stent has had eight rides at Ascot and one at Pinjarra Park.
The Frizzell-trained Nitrobel will also venture from Esperance to Kalgoorlie for the $18,000 Kalgoorlie RSL Handicap (1400m), with Stent also booked to ride.
Leading into today's meeting, Frizzell was not buoyed by Nitrobel's chances.
However, they hoped Stent's expertise in the saddle could reap dividends.
“She ran a really good third on Esperance Cup day when they sat four wide and only got beaten by about three quarters of a length,” they said.
“She hasn't fired a shot since, even though they are working well.
“If they run like a couple of starts ago they will be up there but they have been disappointing.”
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iranian state TV is reporting the country's coast guard has detained 21 fishermen and their three boats from neighboring Arab nations for straying into its territorial waters and fishing rare species.
The Monday report said the traditional boats, known as dhows, had entered Iranian waters near the country's Kish Island in the Persian Gulf. It said the fishermen were handed over to the courts, adding that they had fished rare species of sharks and fish in Iranian waters.
In recent months, Iran has detained 12 dhows in its waters over similar charges.

Brody Dicks, 13, from Park City, Utah, spells "caudation" correctly during the 3rd Round of the Scripps National Spelling Bee in Oxon Hill, Md., Wednesday, May 30, 2018. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)
OXON HILL, Md. (AP) - After a longer build-up than usual, the dramatic final rounds of the Scripps National Spelling Bee get underway Thursday.
Forty-one spellers advanced to the finals out of a field of 516 - by far the largest in the 93-year history of the competition. Scripps started a wild-card program this year that created a path to nationals for spellers who didn't win their regional bees, and some of the finalists got to the bee that way.
The past 13 champions and 18 of the last 22 have been Indian-American, and that trend could easily continue. Most of the consensus favorites in this year's bee have Indian heritage, including Shruthika Padhy, who tied with two others for the best score on the test.
More than 500 spellers tested their skill in front of pronouncer Jacques Bailly or their backup, the Rev. Brian Sietsema, over two days of preliminary rounds. Nearly 200 misspelled words onstage.
Those who advanced to Thursday's final rounds got there by spelling two words correctly on stage over two days and faring well on a written spelling and vocabulary test - and usually by spending multiple hours a day studying at home to prepare.
One of the top scorers was Shruthika, a 12-year-old from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, who finished seventh in last year's bee and is considered one of the favorites this year. But even they got a few answers wrong.
"We thought it was an easy test," bee director Paige Kimble said. "We were wrong."
Here are some other stories from spellers at this year's bee:
STRETCHED THIN
Some spellers devote years to studying the dictionary, word roots and language patterns. Then there's Rebekah Zeigler.
The 13-year-old from Polo, Illinois, is certainly an accomplished speller. She's competing for the fourth time, although she's never made the finals.
That may be because they also compete in tumbling, volleyball, soccer, softball, basketball, cheerleading and track and field. Next month she'll be at the U.S. Trampoline and Tumbling Association national championships.
"I don't have a lot of free time," Rebekah said.
Rebekah got some of the loudest cheers in the preliminary rounds, mostly from a crew of fellow veteran spellers.
Rebekah had never gotten past the second round of onstage spelling, known as Round 3, because a written test constitutes the first round. But they spelled "yarrow" correctly and achieved their goal for the week, adding, "I was really nervous and dreading it all week."

UNUSUAL REPRIEVE
Reagan Remmers of Missoula, Montana, was heading out to lunch with their mom after they misspelled "balaclava."
Or so they thought.
"My mom got a phone call that told them I was reinstated," Reagan said. "I was like, 'Oh, sweet!'"
Turns out, the spelling Reagan gave - "Balaklava" - is a city in Ukraine. Since the judges didn't warn them that their word had a homonym and because Reagan didn't ask for the definition - a garment covering the head and neck except for parts of the face - their spelling was deemed correct after further review.
"I had no idea what the word meant," Reagan said.
Still, their spelling wasn't a complete guess. They asked for the language of origin and was told it was Crimean, which led them to include a "k'' instead of a "c."
This was just the fifth time in 20 years that a speller was reinstated after judges had determined they or they misspelled a word, Kimble said.
___
DEAD AIR
Considering how far they had to travel to get to the bee, Daniel Doudna can be forgiven for taking their time at the microphone.
Daniel lives in Fairbanks, Alaska, one of three spellers from the state. But the 4,100-mile (6,600-kilometer) trip to Washington is nothing new for the 14-year-old: This is their second time in the bee, and two of their older sisters also competed.
When Daniel starts spelling, he's more deliberate than most, pausing after each letter and letting silence hang in the air. Their word on Wednesday was "quietude," and they created some.
"I made too many mistakes by going fast," they said. "After each letter, I mentally review the word to see what the next letter is."

An Austrian asylum seeker stabbed a 50-year-old Christian woman Wednesday after they heard them read the Bible out loud at a refugee shelter.
The incident took place in the Timelkam municipality in Upper Austria state.
After further investigation, the attacker claimed that they attacked the woman due to their own “personal problems.” They also cleared that they had not even seen the victim before.
According to the police, the woman and their husband had been invited to the accommodation to read the Bible for its Christian residents when the angered Afghan man entered the kitchen and stabbed the woman with a butter knife. The woman fell backwards and hurt their ear but their thick coat protected them from serious injury.
Later, the attacker was detained by police and imprisoned in the city of Wels, some 35 kilometres from Timelkam.
Around 700,000 migrants entered Austria last year and about 90,000 applied for asylum in the country sitting on the migrant route from Turkey via Greece and the Balkans to Germany. Afghans constitute the largest national group seeking asylum in Austria.
In 2015, an asylum seeker from Iraq identified as Amir raped a 10-year-old boy at a swimming pool in Vienna. The man later told the police they had had a “sexual emergency”.
In September last year, police in northern Austria detained five migrants from Afghanistan over accusations of sexually harassing women during a wine festival in the city of Wels.The four of the alleged perpetrators appeared to be unaccompanied teenage refugees, aged between 15 and 16, while the fifth was 22 years old.

Blowing agents play a crucial role by helping to induce a specific cellular structure to the foamed material. This helps reduce the density of the foam, improve its acoustic and thermal insulation abilities, and also improve the relative toughness of the original material. Blowing agents can lend the desired characteristics to a myriad of materials. These characteristics could range from light-weighting, heat insulation, and sound absorbency to elasticity, permeability, electrical insulation and shock absorbency.
One of the most widely used blowing agents were chloro fluoro carbons (CFC's). However, they were phased out because of their harmful effects on the ozone layer. While developing new products with similar or better functionality than CFC's, players have to face several challenges such as the impact of the products on the environment and getting suppliers who can supply them with the requisite materials seamlessly among others.

Blowing Agents Market: Growth Enablers
Increasing demand for polymeric foams, especially polyurethane foams, owing to rapid development in their end-user industries such as construction and appliances is driving the demand for blowing agents. Additionally, high growth of end use industries in Asia Pacific is anticipated to further fuel the demand for blowing agents. However, stringent environmental regulations regarding chemicals used as blowing agents might hamper the growth. Development of new environment friendly biobased products for utility as blowing agents might bring future prospective opportunities for market growth.
Blowing Agents Market: Segmentation
The major types of blowing agents that find use in the industry are: Hydrocarbons (HCs), hydro-chloro-fluoro-carbons (HCFCs), and hydro-fluoro-carbons (HFCs). Of these, hydrocarbons currently stand as the dominant product segment. Among hydrocarbons, butanes and pentanes are the most common blowing agents used. HCFCs have been gradually phased out in industrialized nations. In many other developing regions as well, HCFCs are being phased out gradually because of their reported adverse effects such as Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP) and Global Warming Potential (GWP). This has in turn led several companies to develop and launch alternative blowing agents that are environment friendly.
Among the key foams that see the utilization of such blowing agents are: Polyurethane foam, polystyrene foam, phenolic foam, and polyolefin foam. The polyurethane foam industry makes use of all types of blowing agents and as a result, holds a major share in the market. Owing to its wide range of applications in chemicals, construction and automotive industries, demand for polyurethane products is rising at a high growth rate, which, eventually, generates demand for blowing agents.

The marketplace is dominated by a few global players with major market share. However there are a large number of small and medium sized players, especially in Asia Pacific, competing for the market share with aggressive pricing schemes. Leading manufacturers in the blowing agents market include E. I. DuPont de Nemours and Company, Arkema SA, Haltermann GmbH, Foam Supplies Inc, Solvay SA and Honeywell International Ltd.
The State Street Corporation, a financial services company that put the "Fearless Girl" statue on Wall Street to promote the importance of women working in corporate leadership roles, will pay $5 million after an investigation found that it underpaid female and black executives.
The company denies any wrongdoing, but will pay as part of a settlement with the Department of Labor. Law360 reported on the payout earlier this week, and Bloomberg posted the text of the conciliation agreement online.
The Department of Labor investigation found "statistically significant" differences in the pay given women and men in leadership roles at the firm, as well as between the compensation of black and white employees. The differences persisted when the investigators accounted for "legitimate factors," the Department of Labor says.
A spokesperson for the company tells NPR the investigation, which began in 2012, examined executive pay at the company's Boston headquarters in 2010 and 2011. In an official statement, the company says it "disagreed with" the findings of the investigation but "made a decision to bring this six-year-old matter to resolution and move forward."
State Street is "committed to equal pay practices," the company's statement continued.
State Street Corporation commissioned the Fearless Girl statue on Wall Street in honor of International Women's Day this year.
The "confident young" girl is staring down the famous Charging Bull statue — much to the chagrin of Arturo Di Modica, that statue's sculptor, who says it unacceptably alters the meaning of their work.
The statuary stand-off gained a new participant for a few hours this spring, when a small pug statue lifted its leg beside the Fearless Girl's foot.
After installing the statue, State Street said the piece of art sent a "powerful message." "[O]ur goal was to raise awareness and drive a conversation around the need to improve gender diversity in corporate leadership roles," the company wrote. It also shared advice on how to increase the representation of women on corporate boards.
The statue had a mixed reaction from the start.
In March, NPR's Rose Friedman reported that some people were charmed by it, but others — like economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett — had fundamental objections. Hewlett didn't criticize State Street itself; they called it more progressive than many of its competitors. But the statue ...
"Please don't depict American womanhood as a cute 9-year-old," Hewlett told Rose. "The choice of portraying the fierce female as someone who is immature, as someone who hasn't tangled with the world, is a little bit of a travesty."

TAIPEI Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] said is will resume its ride-hailing service in Taiwan on Thursday after talks with the island's authorities, ending a two-month suspension that came after fines from the government.
"After constructive talks with transportation authorities, we are now partnering with licensed rental car companies to resume serving riders in Taipei," Uber said in a statement.
The resumption of service comes after the U.S.-based ride-hailing service halted operations on the island on Feb. 10, after penalties for unlicensed ride-sharing services were increased to as much as T$25 million ($825,873) by Taiwan's Ministry of Transportation and Communications.
"Starting today, people in Taipei can book an Uber ride, and we expect to bring Uber back to other cities in the near future," Likai Gu, general manager of Uber Taiwan, said. "We want to partner with more transportation service partners in weeks and months to come, whether they be from rental car companies or the taxi industry."
Taiwan's highway bureau, which is part of the transport ministry, said that it welcomed Uber's move, but would continue to supervise Uber's operations in Taiwan to ensure that it did not pair up with unlicensed individual drivers.
It said that Uber still had T$830 million in outstanding fines under a legal process of being recovered.
Uber, based in San Francisco, has faced legal scrutiny in markets across Asia, including in Macau and Japan.
In Taiwan, the issue was that Uber said it operated as an internet-based technology platform rather than as a transportation company, which local taxi companies and Taiwanese authorities have said was a misrepresentation of its service.
Uber and the Taiwan transport authorities said that Uber would continue to operate as a technology platform company in Taiwan and that Uber would partner with licensed transport companies.
Taiwanese authorities began imposing fines earlier this year on unlicensed ride-sharing services, targeted at Uber, which the company said at the time were the highest in the world.
In the long-running dispute, Taiwan had maintained Uber's business was illegal, and at one point last year even considered ordering it to leave the domestic market.
But Uber proponents, many of them individual drivers with cars in Taiwan, staged counterprotests to support the business opportunities they said the Uber platform provided.

MOSCOW (AP) — The Russian Olympic Committee says its athletes are overwhelmingly in favor of competing at the upcoming Pyeongchang Olympics.
Sofia Velikaya says the ROC athletes' commission, which they chair, has heard from “all the athletes in all sports” on the Olympic program, with a majority in favor of competing.
Velikaya says no athletes have told the ROC they would rather boycott and adds “at the current moment, everyone's training and everyone's hoping to take part in the Olympics.”
The International Olympic Committee last week barred the Russian team from the Olympics because of doping offenses at the 2014 Sochi Games, but is allowing Russians to compete under a neutral flag as “Olympic Athletes from Russia.”

Speaking to Radio Sputnik, Tippee, chief editor of PennWell's Oil & Gas Journal, explained that there are several factors behind the renewed interest in shale oil.
For one thing, they said, there's the vast scale of the potential supplies. "There's quite a volume of oil and natural gas liquids to be discovered, and investors know that. It's onshore, so you don't have the costs and problems that you have offshore."
Furthermore, the expert noted that costs have come down. "This is expensive drilling, but it's also highly technological drilling, and as producers learn to produce more efficiently in shale, to complete wells more efficiently in shale, the costs come down. The break-evens have actually become quite attractive," with distress costs (drilling contracts, costs of supplies, etc.) also down. Then there is the OPEC production cap, which according to Tippee has allowed producers to hedge production.

The promises made to business by the new administration also play a role, Tippee said.
"As far as the 'Trump bump' is concerned, I think there is a sense across all industries in the United States right now that the very tight, strict regulation that was being imposed by the Obama administration will be relaxed. Certainly in the oil and gas industry there is a sense that producers will be able to do their work. They were running into regulations and impediments in just about every corner of their operations during the Obama administration. So there is a certain amount of Trump factor in this."
"I think more important though is the confidence that producers had that crude prices were going to stay up for a while," the expert noted, adding that here is where things get more complicated. The current price cycle is not of the traditional kind well-known by energy producers. "The unconventional resources – the shale plays change everything, and we're kind of in new territory here."
"With unconventional resources – shale, other tight oil plays, oil sands, we're talking about new resources. We're not talking the conventional reservoirs that characterized the industry before," Tippee explained. "When we get into the area of unconventional reservoirs, we're talking about exponentially more producible oil than we could consider before. That's a very important concept to wrap your mind around in this new era of unconventional resources."
"Now we're producing from the source rock, and there's an enormous new volume of potentially producible hydrocarbons. That's what's new, and we really don't know yet what the production response will be to this latest rebound in activity. What I can say, as somebody writing about this is that so far all the surprises have been on the high side."
For instance, the analyst recalled, "the US Energy Information Administration just projected that production this year will be up 300,000 barrels a day from 2016, and next year it'll be up 700,000 barrels a day from this year – not all from shale plays, but most of it…We haven't seen increases like that –certainly not while we were in the declines of the conventional plays."
Asked about the US potential to export its shale oil, and the effect this will have on global oil exporters, Tippee emphasized that oil's status as a fungible commodity makes any new production competition for Saudi Arabia and every other exporter.

"The United States has become a net exporter of products (gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and so forth.) It's not a net exporter of crude oil, but its need for imported crude oil is much lower than it was 7-8 years ago…The need of the United States for oil from abroad is much diminished, and to that extent, an increase in United States production already is competition for Saudi Arabia and other major exporters," the analyst stressed.
At present, Tippee suggested, the so-called 'million dollar question' is about just what impact this rise in unconventional resource output will have on OPEC and non-OPEC exporters' behavior. "It's the phenomenon that OPEC said it worried about in 2014 when it abandoned supply management initially," its logic being that "someone else will just respond to the price elevation with new production, taking away their market share."
"That's the tension of the moment, and we just don't know [the answer]," the observer noted. "We're in new territory with unconventional resources; we don't know what the supplier response will be. By the end of this year we'll have a much clearer picture of what the potential is."
In the short term at least, Tippee stressed that prices will probably remain "lower rather than higher. A lot of the activity in the United States is predicated on $55 a barrel WTI crude oil. It might not get there; it's kind of struggled to get much above $50 a barrel, even with the relatively high compliance of the OPEC and side agreements. That's because of the response of producers to the price elevation."
"I think there's another source of supply that tends to get overlooked, and that is all the natural gas liquids that come from increasing natural gas production in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere," Tippee added.
"There's quite a bit of condensate, propane, butane, and even ethane now in international trade, and that competes with oil directly or indirectly, and goes up as natural gas production goes up…I think that's another reason to think that crude oil has kind of a lid on it for a while, unless we have some kind of cataclysmic loss of supply, which nobody wants to see, but that's always the potential that hangs over the market."
Lambdin punched Choun four or five times, threw them to the floor, grabbed the biggest kitchen knife they could find and stabbed their wife at least 15 times, according to court documents. When they noticed Choun was still moving, Lambdin contended they didn't want them to suffer and smashed them in the head three times with a heavy ceramic globe, the documents say.
Divide over listing location slows Aramco IPO - WSJ
June 14 Saudi Aramco's planned 2018 public share offering is being slowed down by a divide between Saudi Arabia's ruling family and executives of the kingdom's state oil company over where to list its shares, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.
ALBANY, N.Y. (CBSN) — It will be a happy New Year indeed for millions of the lowest-paid U.S. workers. Nineteen states, including New York and California, will ring in the year with an increase in the minimum wage.
Massachusetts and Washington state will have the highest new minimum wages in the country, at $11 per hour.
California will raise its wage to $10. New York state is taking a regional approach, with the wage rising to $11 in New York City, $10 in its downstate suburbs and $9.70 elsewhere.
“This $1.50 increase, I cannot even comprehend or tell you how important this will be,” says Alvin Major, a New York City fast-food worker. The 51-year-old father of four helped lead the fight for the increase in their state, one of several successful efforts by fast-food workers and other low wageworkers around the country. “The price of food has gone up. Rent has gone up. Everything has gone up. … This will make a difference for so many people.”
Voters in Arizona, Maine, Colorado and Washington approved increases in this year's election. Seven other states — Alaska, Florida, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio and South Dakota — are automatically raising the wage based on indexing. The other states seeing increases are Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Michigan and Vermont.
Workers and labor advocates argue the increases will help low-wage workers now barely making ends meet and boost the economy by giving some consumers more money to spend. But many business owners opposed the higher wages, saying they would lead to higher prices and greater automation.
Some restaurant owners may consider reducing portion sizes or charging for side dishes that were once included in the price of a meal to absorb the increase, according to Melissa Fleischut, president of the New York State Restaurant Association.
“I'm sure prices will go up where they can, but restaurants want to avoid sticker shock,” they said. “They're going to have to get creative.”
The adjustments in Oregon, New York, California and several other states are part of a series of gradual increases to a $12 or $15 hourly wage.
The minimum wage will also go up this weekend in 22 cities and counties, including San Diego, San Jose and Seattle.
The high number of states and localities raising the wage this year reflects the successful work of fast-food workers and organized labor, according to Tsedeye Gebreselassie, senior staff attorney at the National Employment Law Project, as well as federal inaction on the wage. The national minimum was last raised, to $7.25, in 2009.
“These aren't only teens trying to make some pocket money,” they said. “Increasingly it's adults who are using this money to support their families.”
DENVER (AP) — From loser's lament to winning formula, the Denver Broncos finally played the clean game rookie head coach Vance Joseph has been pining for ever since they started their eight-game spiral.
After every loss, seven of them by double digits, the Broncos (4-9) would agonize over their poor play and bad luck. They suggested if they could just manage to get an early lead and win the turnover battle, they'd be able to capitalize on their dominant defense, stick to a ground game and find their way again.
They did all that in a 23-0 win over the New York Jets on Sunday that snapped their longest losing streak in a half century.
“It's the formula we've been searching for,” pass rusher Shane Ray said. “Unfortunately it's happened kind of late. (But) it's something we can build off.”
The Broncos didn't turn the ball over and had two takeaways, one on a strip sack by Brandon Marshall and the other on an interception by Darian Stewart .
They jumped out to an early 10-0 lead and never let up in holding the Jets (5-8) to exactly 100 yards of offense.
“We knew if we played clean football it would look like that,” said Joseph, who found themselves on the hot seat after just a dozen games. “We were plus-2 in turnovers. That's huge. The field position, our average start was 41 and theirs was 20. It's really a flip game of what we've seen in the last two months.”
That was thanks to finally finding a punt returner they could count on in Jordan Taylor, who gave the Broncos field position all afternoon, unlike rookie Isaiah McKenzie, who was benched last week for the remainder of the season after fumbling six times.
It also helped that they finally got away from their stubborn insistence on three-receiver sets, the formation they were in for 27 of their 30 sacks and 13 of their 14 interceptions over their previous 10 games.
“Our plan was to run the ball efficiently on first and second down and keep the third downs manageable. If not, punt the ball back,” Joseph said. “It's the formula we set out to accomplish and it worked. It worked perfectly.”
Other takeaways from Denver's first shutout in 12 years:
JETS JETTISONED: On a day the Bills and Colts combined for 546 yards in a blizzard at Buffalo, the Jets managed a mere 100 yards of offense on a sunny 60-degree day in Denver.
The Jets' 59 yards on the ground and 41 through the air didn't sit well with tight end Austin Seferian-Jenkins, either.
“I don't want to hear that playoff talk,” they said, channeling Jim Mora . “I don't want to see this (expletive) again.”
McCOWN HURT: Veteran QB Josh McCown's season might be over after breaking their left hand when they were clobbered by Ray in the second half.
“He kind of rolled over me and either a knee or a foot or something of theirs caught my hand and it bent funny,” McCown said. “I knew when it happened something wasn't right.”
McCown, who had left the game briefly earlier with a hip pointer, wasn't sure if he'll be back this season.
“We'll see. I'll do whatever I can to get ready to go and we'll see where that leaves me,” they said. “We still have some more tests and things that we can do and will look at, but my heart is with these guys. I want to finish with these guys and if I can be out there I would love to be out there.”
ROAD WOES: The Jets fell to 1-5 on the road.
“It seems like we don't come out with the same energy we have in home games,” cornerback Morris Claiborne said. “When you're on the road, you have to pretty much bring your own energy. We come out flat. … It's embarrassing, man. Any way you look at it. It's embarrassing to get shut out.”
Especially by a team that hadn't won a game in 70 days.
TALIB RETURNS: Aqib Talib returned from a one-game suspension for their fight with Raiders receiver Michael Crabtree that cost them a $608,996 game check.
“I enjoyed my little time off,” Talib said. “It was an expensive vacation. I felt good, real fresh out there.”
The Jets really didn't test Talib, who had a single tackle.
MILLER TIME: Winning in the NFL is nothing to sneeze at, but Von Miller couldn't help themselves as they sneezed four times on the way up to the podium after the game.
“Must be allergic to winning,” they cracked as they took out their handkerchief.
Turning serious, they said, “Getting back in the winning column is an amazing feeling. We just want hold on to this emotion and remember how it feels to win, and just carry it on through the rest of the season.”
NO DOUBTING THOMAS: WR Demaryius Thomas surpassed Hall of Fame tight end Shannon Sharpe to move into second place in two categories: most TD catches (56 to 55) and most receiving yards (8,475 to 8,439)
“Man, it means the world,” said Thomas, who led all receivers with eight catches for 93 yards and a TD. “It just shows the hard work I've put in paying off.”
Thomas trails Rod Smith (68 TDs and 11,389 yards) in both categories.

In a somewhat bizarre move, the organisers of Reading and Leeds Festival have confirmed that pineapples feature on the list of items banned from the event this year, alongside any items which may be considered weapons and gas canisters amongst other things.
The action comes following fans of Oxford band Glass Animals gaining an affinity to the tropical fruit, after it featured prominently in the band's hit ‘Pork Soda', containing the bamboozling line: “pineapples are in my head”. The fruit appears to have gained a cult status with the band, with their Glastonbury set adorned with pineapples during the performance in June and some fans even dressing as pineapples in homage to the unique lyrics.
Band drummer Joe Seward saw the funny side behind the ban, claiming it would be a “challenge” for fans to sneak the notoriously obtuse fruit into the festival. They continued to say “Anyone who wasn't bringing a pineapple definitely is now,” finishing with the tongue in cheek suggestion that, “It's fruitist. Watermelons are fine, but not pineapples?”
The acid test around the ban will be displayed at the festivals later this month. Check out ‘Pork Soda' below, and have pineapples floating around your head all day.
Angela Couloumbis covers state government in Harrisburg. They have been a reporter at the Inquirersince 1996, covering city government, courts and neighborhoods in Philadelphia and Camden, and the governors and governments of New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
HARRISBURG — When state legislators fled for summer break last week, they stranded a pile of important bills on hot-button issues such as domestic violence, fraternity hazing, redistricting, abortion, and cutting the size of the legislature.
Although some could come up for votes this fall, others are likely to get passed over for less controversial measures ahead of the November election.
The stakes, after all, are high: Every state House seat and half the seats in the Senate are on the ballot. Each chamber has scheduled just nine voting days before the election, and controversial votes can and will be used in campaigns.
Steve Miskin, spokesperson for Republicans, who control the House, said that chamber's priority when it returns to session is limiting regulations, including a proposal to give the legislature power to revoke individual rules. In the Senate, Republicans who hold the majority plan to make school safety measures one of their top priorities, according to spokesperson Jennifer Kocher.
Less clear is what the legislature might do with several stalled high-profile bills.
Among them is an anti-hazing measure sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman (R., Centre), motivated by the death of Pennsylvania State University student Tim Piazza. The bill would increase penalties for hazing, create stricter reporting requirements for universities, and add a safe harbor provision for some students who seek help in an emergency.
The hazing bill sailed unanimously through the Senate and made it out of a House committee but still needs additional votes in the House. The delay disappoints the Corman camp, which had wanted the new reporting requirements to go into effect for the upcoming school year.
Privately, some Senate Republicans have said they believe House Speaker Mike Turzai (R., Allegheny) delayed votes on hazing to try to push the Senate to hold a vote on their bill that would ban abortion based solely on a diagnosis of Down syndrome.
That bill is highly controversial. Proponents describe it as an effort to prevent eugenics and say it's similar to a section of the current law that prohibits abortions based on the sex of a fetus. Critics argue that it infringes on private health decisions, and it's unclear how such a law could be enforced. And having to vote on the bill could endanger senators in swing districts.
Gun bills are also politically touchy. Even measures requiring people with domestic-violence convictions or restraining orders against them to forfeit their firearms to law enforcement or a gun dealer were derailed.
Rep. Marguerite Quinn (R., Bucks), a sponsor of one of the bills, learned on their way to the Capitol that a Western Pennsylvania-based gun rights group that had previously taken a neutral position was now opposed. The bill was stopped in its tracks.
“I was caught off guard,” Quinn said. They hope for a floor vote in September.
“I believe that firearm owners respect the fact that with the right [to carry] comes a responsibility – and if you've committed a crime, they understand a penalty will follow,” they said. “When they recognize what is in the bill and what it does, it will have support.”
Kim Stolfer, president of Firearms Owners Against Crime, said changes to the bill were being made at the last minute, prompting their group to oppose it. They called Quinn's bill “a constitutional nightmare.”
“We are not going to accept unconstitutional and unworkable sections of the law that will violate people's rights and create unintended consequences. That is what Quinn's bill is,” Stolfer said.
In addition to those bills, others that deal with gun restrictions — including measures that would ban rapid-firing devices known as “bump stocks” or would allow people with mental or physical health concerns to voluntarily surrender guns — also remain in limbo.
Also left on the table: a bill by Rep. John Taylor (R., Phila.) that would have allowed the use of up to 12 speed cameras on Roosevelt Boulevard, a longtime city priority for one of its deadliest roads. Philadelphia has about 100 traffic-related fatalities a year (93 in 2017), and typically 10 percent happen on the Boulevard. Seven of the nine fatal crashes on the road in 2017 involved pedestrians.
Two measures pushed by government reform groups also stalled. One would create an independent commission to draw election district boundaries lines; another would reduce the size of the legislature. Because they require amending the state constitution, they must pass in the exact form during two consecutive sessions and then be approved by voters.
The redistricting commission measure is in its first session — but it would need to pass by the end of the week because of advertising requirements. In addition, there are 607 proposed House amendments in the House.
With that many proposals, “you can never get to the underlying discussion about what the bill does,” Miskin said.
A separate bill that would reduce the size of the legislature has flip-flopped between both chambers amid a disagreement over whether they should trim both chambers or just one.
When it passed last session, it was written to reduce just the size of the 203-seat House. But this time around, an amendment was added to scale back the size of the Senate too. The Senate, with 50 members, stripped out that amendment and bounced it back to the House, where the bill now sits.
Asked whether the House would vote to reduce its own size, Miskin said, “I don't know. That is still being worked on.”
Rep. Jerry Knowles (R., Schuylkill), one of the champions of the bill to reduce the House's size, said, “I just scratch my head about how this could possibly happen.”
Knowles said that measure had passed comfortably in the last two-year session, and that many of the members who voted for it then are still in the House now.
“I think the problem is that some of them [House members] voted for it because it was the popular thing to do – and never really dreamed it would get this far,” Knowles said. “And shame on them if they did that.”
“To me, it's an easy vote,” they added.
When the United States imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports last month, the European Union and a handful of other key allies got a temporary exemption that expires next week. China was not granted an exemption and took its case to the World Trade Organization. This week, the EU has decided to join that complaint, as have Russia, India and others.

Rate hike?
Investors believe the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at a two-day meeting that wraps up Wednesday. At its last meeting in November the panel decided to keep the Fed's benchmark interest rate unchanged in a low range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent. With the economy on solid footing, the Fed is expected to raise rates for the third time this year.

Costco's shares slumped nearly 7.5 percent in October after it said its gross margins shrank in the fourth quarter. The stock has rallied about 20 percent since then, reaching an all-time high. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Costco to report earnings per share rose to $1.33, up from $1.17 a year earlier.
“Nearly two years after Apple introduced the Smart Connector on the original iPad Pro, only four accessories support it. One of those is the own Smart Keyboard, Apple's first and only keyboard cover, which is available for the iPad Pro's 9.7-inch, 10.5-inch, and 12.9-inch variants,” Jared Newman reports for Fast Company. “The other products – two kinds of keyboards and one docking station–are all made by Logitech and are sold at Apple Stores. That's a far skimpier selection than you might have expected back in the fall of 2015.”
“Accessory makers offered several explanations for the slow start. One source cited wait times and high costs for Smart Connector components. Other accessory makers simply praised Bluetooth as a better fit, at least for iPad keyboards,” Newman reports. “Apple confirmed that multiple companies are now developing Smart Connector accessories.”
“The real advantage for the Smart Connector isn't just the hassle-free, powered connection, but the possibilities it could open up for the iPad as a whole. Imagine, for instance, a keyboard that could charge the iPad through a built-in battery, or one with extra storage that integrated with Apple's new Files app in iOS 11. Perhaps there's even room for more kinds of input devices, such as a MIDI keyboard dock that didn't require toting around an extra Lightning cable and stand,” Newman reports. “The Smart Connector is still full of potential.”

Louth minors are in dire need of a victory over the old enemy, Meath, at the Gaelic Grounds tonight as anything but would likely end their dreams of a place in the Leinster last four.
Following last Wednesday's enthralling contest with Wicklow in Ardee, which ended in a draw, the Wee County's hopes of progression hang by a thread as they remain winless in their group.
Having put in a credible performance in the opening round loss to Dublin at Parnell Park, their aspirations of finishing in the top two, thus qualifying for a semi-final berth, relied upon disposing of the Garden County. But by conceding five goals and sacrificing a winning position late in the game, only to level at the death through Ryan Walsh, their fate is out of their own hands and a defeat tomorrow night would puncture their chances altogether.
Though fate could well be on their side. In 2011, the same year that Carlow defeated Louth at Portlaoise in the senior first round, the Wee County minors got over Meath - a feat they have failed to repeat in the seven years since, while, also in that campaign, they scored five goals in a match, with Laois having the leaky rear-guard. The Wee County had not reached that tally of majors in a match since then, prior to last week's goalfest.
But this challenge looks a lot more daunting considering Dublin - the competition favourites - who scored 3-15 against Louth in round one, albeit only pulling away in the final quarter, were defeated by the Royals in Navan on the same night of the 11-goal thriller in Ardee.
Consequently, Louth's Boyneside foes top the group, alongside Offaly, on four points and are in pole position to consolidate their group leadership credentials at the Gaelic Grounds.
Meath's full-forward line contributed 1-9 of their 1-13 total against the Dubs, while they rattled Westmeath for 2-20 in their opener. On the other hand, Louth's defence has been the costliest in the championship having conceded 8-27 in just the two encounters.
Realistically, Malcolm McDonnell and Tom Rooney's side face the possibility of having to travel to Westmeath in round four with nothing to play for bar pride, before finishing their campaign in Offaly. The rather underwhelming prospect at that point would be entering the secondary provincial competition while the four top guns perform in the knockout proper.
If Louth is to have any prospect of avoiding the inevitable, in the form of the Shield matches, then victory is imperative in Drogheda. For this, they will need captain Dáire Nally producing as diligently as they did last week, while their general play around the field will need to improve.
It looks a big ask, though Louth can cling onto the 2011 omen in preparing themselves.

ATLANTA, Ga (AP) — A man has been charged with multiple misdemeanors after being arrested at SunTrust Park, marking the first arrest in connection with crimes at the new stadium for the Atlanta Braves.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports Kevin Thompson of Smyrna was arrested Saturday at 11 p.m. for criminal trespassing, obstructing a law enforcement officer, public intoxication and assault. They were later released on a $4,000 bond.
The Atlanta Braves' new home hosted its first game of the Major League Baseball season Friday. Saturday night's game was a continuation of the series against the San Diego Padres.
The stadium officially opened April 8 for a college baseball game between the University of Georgia and the University of Missouri.
“iPhone assembler Wistron, a smaller rival to Hon Hai Precision Industry and Pegatron, on Wednesday confirmed that waterproof and wireless charging will be incorporated into the new 5.5-inch iPhones to be launched later this year,” Debby Wu reports for Nikkei.
“‘Assembly process for the previous generations of [iPhones] have not changed much, though new features like waterproof and wireless charging now require some different testing, and waterproof function will alter the assembly process a bit,' Hwang told reporters after the company's annual shareholders' meeting on Wednesday,” Wu reports. “Hwang said they expect their company to ship more smartphones in 2017 than 2016, without providing a number.”
Wu reports, “Wistron is also making iPhone SE and iPhone 6 in India, according to Yuanta's Pu.”

Text to 911 is scheduled to be implemented in Dawson and Gosper counties on June 15, 2018. The text to 911 system is designed for deaf, hard of hearing and speech impaired citizens. In addition, if a person needs to contact 911 and by making a voice call their life might be endangered, texting would be their best option.
Since location information will be unreliable in most cases, calling 911 direct remains the fastest and most efficient way to request emergency assistance.
Text to 911 calls will be handled similar to TTY 911 calls. They will be received through the 911 system but without reliable location information. Because of the lack of address information the priority will be to determine the caller's exact location. If a reasonable location can be established units will be dispatched.
If it is determined the caller is not within Dawson and Gosper County it will not be possible to transfer the call to the correct jurisdiction at this time. At this point the caller would be instructed to call 911 so they could be transferred to the correct 911 center, unless the safety of the caller would be compromised by a voice call. In this instance we would relay the information to the correct jurisdiction.
When an operator disconnects the call an automatic message will be sent advising the caller they have been disconnected and to either call 911 by voice or initiate a new text message if they need additional assistance.
This service is not currently supported by all cell phone carriers or other 911 centers in the region. If you attempt a text and it is NOT supported, you will receive a message advising you that you must make a voice call to 911. Currently our text capabilities have limitations on languages other than English.
Limit the use of abbreviations to ensure your message is understood, and review your message for accuracy before you hit to send button-auto correct can distort your message.

TORONTO — Curtis Dickson scored four goals and two assists as the Calgary Roughnecks used a big fourth quarter to beat the Toronto Rock 16-8 on Saturday night in National Lacrosse League action.
Riley Lowen and Dane Dobbie had hat tricks for Calgary (2-5), which scored nine unanswered goals to finish the game. Wesley Berg and Holden Cattoni both struck twice with Tyson Bell and Garrett McIntosh also chipping in.
Rob Hellyer scored a hat trick for the Rock (4-3) with Latrell Harris, Tom Schreiber, Challen Rogers, Adam Jones and Brett Hickey rounding out the attack.
Christian Del Bianco made 47 saves for the win in net as Nick Rose kicked out 35-of-49 shots in defeat.
Rep. Steve King (R-IA) blasted the angry left on Wednesday at the scene of a shooting earlier in the day that wounded House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), an aide, and two Capitol Police.
“America has been divided,” King said, according to the Washington Post. “And the center of America is disappearing, and the violence is appearing in the streets, and it's coming from the left.”
Asked whether the shooting was politically motivated, they said they did not know why the gunman did what they did.
However, King pointed at anger and demonstrations against Trump, according to the Post:
King, in their remarks at the shooting scene, said it was impossible to separate the hyperpartisan climate in Washington — especially people protesting Trump — with Republican members of Congress being fired upon at a baseball practice. “The divisions within the country, people that can't accept the results of the election that are determined to try to take this country down, take this organization down,” they said. “This city was filled up with demonstrations the day after the inauguration, where you couldn't drive down the streets. And we've had demonstrations every week since then, sometimes different topics.” King added: “We do need to focus on what's happening to the culture in this country.”
The shooter has been identified as James T. Hodgkinson III, 66, of Belleville, Ill. by law enforcement officials.
The shooting occurred early Wednesday morning at a park where Republican members of congress and their aides were practicing for an annual baseball charity game played against Democratic colleagues.
Democrats were also practicing at the time, but in D.C.
An FBI official told reporters at the scene that it was “too early to tell” if the GOP members of congress were targeted or not.
Yet, a look at a Facebook page appearing to belong to Hodgkinson showed they were a Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) supporter who bashed Trump several times and liked an anti-Scalise cartoon.
EUGENE, Ore. (AP) — Payton Pritchard scored 16 points, Troy Brown had 10 points, 12 rebounds and four assists and Oregon beat winless Texas Southern 74-68 on Monday night.
Oregon forward Kenny Wooten blocked Trayvon Reed's layup with 1:56 remaining but Texas Southern kept possession and Donte Clark made a basket to pull the Tigers within 69-66.
Brown scored on the next two possessions for the Ducks, including a 3-pointer to cap the scoring with 45 seconds to go. Demontrae Jefferson and Clark both missed shots in the closing seconds for Texas Southern.
Wooten added 13 points with four blocks for Oregon (6-3). Paul White and Victor Bailey Jr. each scored 11 points, and Mikyle McIntosh had 10 points and eight boards.

Clark scored 17 points for Texas Southern (0-8) and Jefferson added 16 with five assists. The Tigers shot 39 percent from the floor but hit 13 of 14 free throws.
BIG PICTURE
Texas Southern will attempt to give coach Mike Davis their 100th victory with the Tigers when they continue their 13-game opening road slate at Baylor, Wyoming, TCU and BYU before starting Southwestern Athletic Conference play.
Oregon defeated the third winless team among its first 10 opponents, but the competition gets tougher with two games against teams with power ratings in the top 60 in Portland State and Fresno State. The latter will be the Ducks' only game outside of Oregon before January.

Experts weigh in on indigenous child protection The West Australian
The assistant federal minister for children is pushing for new rules for the adoption of abused aboriginal children.
Protestors have long fought to have the tampon GST abolished, citing sanitary items as a necessity not a luxury.
Protestors have long fought to have the tampon GST abolished, citing sanitary items as a necessity not a luxury.
What is the tampon tax? The West Australian
The Senate has urged the Federal Government to scrap the GST on tampons and sanitary pads, with one crossbencher labelling the tax “demeaning to women”.
Derryn Hinch threw their support behind a motion, moved by fellow crossbench senator David Leyonhjelm, which passed the Upper House on Tuesday.
“It's demeaning to women,” Senator Hinch told Parliament.
“It is a disgrace that women are being put through this in this country. In 2018 that we're even discussing it is Noddyland.”
Government frontbencher James McGrath said changes to the GST would need to be supported by all States and Territories, as well as the Federal Parliament.
Labor Senator Anthony Chisholm said the Opposition supported removing the tax on women's sanitary products, but wanted to work with State governments to ensure they were no worse off.
“The Liberals have little interest in making this a reality,” Senator Chisholm said.
The Greens failed in a bid to remove the tax from sanitary products by amending government legislation last year.

DALLAS-- There's a growing concern among a few Uptown Dallas neighborhoods. That concern? People fear they soon won't be able to call it home.
Anthony Page with the Uptown Neighborhood Association says, “Right now there's an emerging proposal to demolish a lot of the most affordable housing here and that would end up displacing 600 people in four separate blocks.”
At this point, developers are simply proposing the idea. But, if the city says yes… Turtle Creek Terrace apartments would be the first to be torn down and replaced with luxury apartments.
Page says, “There was a gentleman who spoke very passionately at a recent neighborhood meeting, they live with their daughter, here at this property. They work at a retail property up on Knox Street, he's able to walk there, their daughter is established in schools here. They said if they leave this place, he's going to have to find a new place for their daughter to go to school, they don't know how he's going to go to their job because they don't have a car.”
Page and the Uptown Neighborhood Association are asking people to attend an event on Tuesday where developers will be presenting their ideas.
Page is hoping to share theirs at the meeting as well, saying there are too many high rises. “It's very difficult to find affordable housing, and as a matter of a fact the city is working on affordable workforce housing programs to address this crisis. So, at the same time they are working to solve the crisis with one hand, they could be potentially making a crisis by putting 600 people out on the streets.”
The city hasn't gotten back to us about our questions, and sounds like they haven't made any decisions on the project either. Which is why page is hoping people will share what they think, one way or the other.

Fines for speeding and other traffic offences are set to bring a record one billion euros into French state coffers next year, but ever stricter driving rules are still failing to reduce road deaths.
Figures from the draft state budget for next year show that traffic fines are projected to be around €928 million, a 10 percent increase on 2017.
When extra fines for late payment are added in, that will bring takings to over one billion euros for the first time, Les Echos financial daily reported
The attempted crackdown on speeding and other offences was part of the government's bid to reduce the number of people who die every year on France's roads. Thirty-two percent of deadly accidents are caused by speeding in France.
READ ALSO
Tougher rules were brought in in 2012 by the then Socialist government, with the then interior minister Manuel Valls saying they wanted the death toll to be brought below 2,000 people a year by 2020.
But that plan is starting to appear as over-optimistic, given that road deaths have been on the rise for the last three years.
Last year 3,477 people were killed in road accidents, according to figures from Sécurité Routière, the national road safety authority.
President Emmanuel Macron last month announced new road safety measures, including banning hands-free phone kits in cars, lowering the already very low alcohol limit for young drivers, and trying out saliva tests to detect drug use.
The government also plans to extend the use of private companies to run speed cameras after an initial test that was carried out in the Normandy region.
The man suspected of killing at least 10 people on Monday by plowing a rented white van down crowded Toronto sidewalks appeared in court this morning, where they were charged with 10 counts of murder and 13 counts of attempted murder.
And the Toronto police officer who arrested Alek Minassian — who during a tense standoff repeatedly yelled that they wanted the officer to shoot them — is receiving wide praise for their restraint. The CBC says the officer has been identified as Constable Ken Lam.
In video shot by bystanders, the suspect stands next to the battered white van and draws what looks to be a weapon (although police later said they had no weapon on him, according to the Toronto Star).
The officer is pointing a gun at him. "Get down!" Lam is heard saying. "Kill me!" says the suspect, claiming that they have a gun in their pocket. "I don't care, get down!" the officer replies. "Get down or you'll be shot."
"Shoot me in the head," the suspect says. The officer continues to urge them to get down. Seconds later, the video shows the suspect on the ground as the officer puts them in handcuffs. Lam did not fire any shots.
Mike McCormack, president of the Toronto Police Association, said they believe the officer with "prevented further carnage," the Star reports.
"He's shaken up by the whole thing, and shaken up by the magnitude. They said, 'You know, I was just doing my job,' " McCormack said. "He's been confronted by someone who is making like they have a weapon, threatening the officer's life, trying to get the officer to shoot him, and they arrest that guy."
Ralph Goodale, Canada's minister of public safety and emergency preparedness, said on Twitter that they were "grateful for the brave and professional response of @TorontoPolice and other first responders to the horrific attack at Yonge and Finch," the streets where the attack took place.
Star columnist Rosie DiManno describes the officer as "remarkably composed."
"All the fingerprints of suicide by cop," they write. "But the officer didn't shoot and the suspect dropped to their knees, flinging their arms in the air."
DiManno adds: "On a day of many heroes, that brave cop is at the top of the list, along with the many first responders, paramedics and hospital resources stretched to the limits."
The CBC reports that this incident "stands in contrast to footage of other police takedowns in Toronto that haven't ended peacefully." Here's more:
"The Toronto Police Service was widely criticized for its handling of the Sammy Yatim case in 2013 that led to Const. James Forcillo's conviction for attempted murder in the shooting death of the 18-year-old. Forcillo is appealing their sentence of six years in prison. ... "Members of the Toronto Police Services Board passed a motion in February to issue hundreds of more conducted energy weapons (CEWs), or Tasers, to certain on-duty constables. The move is billed as a way to help the police force achieve a goal of zero deaths when it comes to interactions between the public and police. "Part of the approved motion also requires the TPS to conduct a review of other use-of-force options and gather input from the public and affected groups."
The suspect's motive is unclear, although police told reporters yesterday that they believe the rampage was deliberate. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday that there is no evidence the incident "has a national security element," according to the CBC.
BRUSSELS (AP) - The European Union's top trade official says the 28-nation bloc should be excluded from U.S. President Donald Trump's new steel and aluminum tariffs, which enter force this week.
EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said Monday that "the EU should be excluded as a whole" and that they would convey this message to U.S. representatives in talks in Washington on Tuesday.
Malmstrom said the EU is willing to address the problem of steel overproduction, which they say is the real cause of pain for the U.S. and European industries.
Trump is imposing tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum, but is temporarily exempting Canada and Mexico.
The EU has drawn up a list of "rebalancing" duties to slap on U.S. products if it is not exempted.
Safety is a major concern in any industry since the beginning. Whether it is for food processing or packaging, manufacturers are being sure that all edible products are kept fresh and good until they are consumed. It is the responsibility of the manufacturers of the product to provide safe packings with lining to avoid spillage or contamination. It is important to remember that any item may be subjected to environmental stimulus, edible or not, that enters the confines of food while producing, processing, transporting or storage facility, has the probability to cause harm, to human beings, pets, products and businesses if not treated, validated for suitability, wholesomeness from a regulatory and industry standards standpoint.
Many manufacturers manufacture polycoated and wax papers for the packaging of food products either ready to eat or package foods or other dry or wet raw foods. These packaging papers are greaseproof treated in the form of bags and pouches that hold processed, semi-processed or raw foods. Asian consumers are more concerned about staying green and the majority of the food packagings are providing eco-friendly packagings. Manufactures are providing more natural coloured and recycled papers in food packagings with lining to meet the increasing environmental concerns.
According to the study “Asia Packaging Lining Industry Situation and Prospects Research Report”, the packaging lining market in Asia is divided based on type of products such as paper, plastic, rubber and other. The market is categorized based on applications such as food, beverage, electronics, industrial use and many more. Packaging lining market in Asia is geographically spread across China, Japan, India, Korea, Saudi Arabia and other regions. The leading players in Asia's packaging lining market are JMP Holdings, Arena Products, Linertech, Protective Lining Corp., LC Packaging, Plascon, DS Smith, Shenzhen Dongtai Sponge Products, Kadary, Ian Bicking, Green Light Packaging, Rongyeda, Nantong Xinyi Sponge, Jiaxing Packing and Shanghai Zhongfan.
Asia is witnessing urbanisation, huge investments in housing and construction, development of retail chains, developing healthcare and cosmetics sectors are driving packagings with lining in economies such as China, India, Brazil, and Russia. It was observed that there is an increase in living standards and personal disposable income that encourages the consumption of package food and various other ranges of products which subsequently adheres the growth in packaging lining. The major market trends that drive Asia's packaging lining are smaller households, demand for easy or ready to eat foods, demand for unadulterated products, and smaller pack sizes. These trends will drive the growth in the packaging lining market in Asia over the next few years.

Five Gloucestershire businesses have donated to get charity team Egg Chasers Rugby off the ground in a show of rugby spirit, bringing founder Andy Jarrett's brain child a step closer to fruition.
Andy Jarrett, the team founder, decided to start a veteran Barbarian team after finding out that their friend Mike Crisp, who they played with at county level, was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease.
Scotland legend Doddie Weir was diagnosed with the same condition and has been raising the profile and knowledge of MND with the help of many rugby legends.
AJC Electrics, Gloucester Biltong, Go Travel, On Toast and Blue Bamboo have been able to dig deep in order to fund the teams kit which will be going all over the South West with their only aim to raise money for Motor Neurone Disease Association with a team of veterans from the area.
Jarrett said: “I've always thought about starting a charity rugby team for a long time now, but after finding out about Mike Crisp's diagnosis I needed to make the leap of faith and with thanks to the rugby family it has really taken off.
“Mike is a Cheltenham Rugby stalwart and now I want to both raise money for and knowledge of MNDA.”
When Jarrett started off it was themselves and social media but they designed a logo and a couple of friends started to help run the operation.
In a matter of weeks of sending emails the local businesses started to dig deep.
Jarrett said: “To say I was beyond myself with happiness would be putting it lightly, it really goes to show how giving people are and how the sport of rugby is at the centre of the community I cannot thank our sponsors enough.”
When it comes to getting veteran players to put their boots back on the response was bigger and almost instant.
“I now have a compliment of players from all over from the local Dowty, Old Richians and Stroud to Cinderford, Pontypool and Bristol with more in the works, and they will be representing our team as ambassadors,” said Jarrett.
“I do not think it takes much to ask ex-players to lace up the boots again they only need a little excuse.”
The first match will be against Cheltenham which will be a team built up by Mike Crisp themselves in October and everything is moving forward to their official first test match.
Jarrett added: “We are only awaiting the fixture dates for Cheltenham's 2018-19 season and we will then link up, hopefully we'll get a couple of sevens games during the summer to stretch out tired legs.

For a decade, every major operating system has relied on a technique known as address space layout randomization to provide a first line of defense against malware attacks. By randomizing the computer memory locations where application code and data are loaded, ASLR makes it hard for attackers to execute malicious payloads when exploiting buffer overflows and similar vulnerabilities. As a result, exploits cause a simple crash rather than a potentially catastrophic system compromise.
Further Reading How security flaws work: The buffer overflow Now, researchers have devised an attack that could spell the end of ASLR as the world knows it now. The attack uses simple JavaScript code to identify the memory addresses where system and application components are loaded. When combined with attack code that exploits vulnerabilities in browsers or operating systems, the JavaScript can reliably eliminate virtually all of the protection ASLR provides. The technique, which exploits what's known as a side channel in the memory cache of all widely used modern CPUs, is described in a research paper published on Wednesday. The researchers have dubbed the technique ASLR Cache or AnC for short.
"Fundamentally insecure"
The researchers said the side channel attack is much more damaging than previous ASLR bypasses, because it exploits a micro-architectural property of the CPU's that's independent of any operating system or application running on it. Whereas heap spraying and other forms of ASLR bypass can often be mitigated by software tweaks, there isn't much that can stop or lessen the effects of the JavaScript, which targets a CPU's MMU, or memory management unit. That's because CPU caching behavior and strong address space randomization are mutually exclusive. (Apple, however, recently hardened its Safari browser to partially mitigate such attacks. It's also possible to prevent JavaScript from running in a browser, but such blocking often severely degrades a site's usability.)
The researchers wrote:
In this paper, we show that the problem is much more serious and that ASLR is fundamentally insecure on modern cache-based architectures. Specifically, we show that it is possible to derandomize ASLR completely from JavaScript, without resorting to esoteric operating system or application features. Unlike all previous approaches, we do not abuse weaknesses in the software (that are relatively easy to fix). Instead, our attack builds on hardware behavior that is central to efficient code execution: the fast translation of virtual to physical addresses in the MMU by means of page tables. As a result, all fixes to our attacks (e.g., naively disabling caching) are likely too costly in performance to be practical. To our knowledge, this is the first attack that side-channels the MMU and also the very first cache attack that targets a victim hardware rather than software component.
The researchers went on to combine their AnC JavaScript with attack code that exploits CVE-2013-0753, a now-patched use-after-free vulnerability in Firefox. Normally, ASLR protections in the 64-bit version of the browser require a separate information-disclosure exploit to achieve code execution. Using AnC, however, the researchers were able to mount an end-to-end attack that completely hijacked the control flow without any such information-disclosure exploit. Below is a video of the technique:
AnC works by using what's known as an EVICT+TIME cache attack that detects which memory locations are accessed by a CPU's MMU. The researchers identified 22 microarchitectures from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and ARM that were vulnerable. They went on to say they have yet to test an architecture that didn't provide the MMU signal necessary to exploit the side channel. The vulnerabilities are indexed as CVE-2017-5925 as they apply to Intel processors, CVE-2017-5926 for AMD processors, CVE-2017-5927 for ARM processors, and CVE-2017-5928 for a timing issue affecting multiple browsers. The paper was written by Ben Gras, Keveh Razavi, Erik Bosman, Herbert Bos, and Cristiano Giuffrida of the VUsec systems security group at the University of Amsterdam. They have published this resource page with additional information about the technique.
Given how crucial caching is to the performance of modern CPUs, the researchers say architectural fixes are likely to be too costly to be feasible. And even if hardware mitigations are possible—say, by creating a separate cache for page tables—the researchers warn that the vulnerability may resurface in software. They conclude their findings with a recommendation that's sure to get the attention of software developers everywhere:
"We hence recommend ASLR to no longer be trusted as a first line of defense against memory error attacks and for future defenses not to rely on it as a pivotal building block."
BERLIN (AP) - The new leader of one of Germany's governing parties says they plan to join a protest against working conditions at Amazon during a visit by company CEO Jeff Bezos to Berlin.
Andrea Nahles, the chairperson of the center-left Social Democrats, said they would take part in a demonstration Tuesday outside publisher Axel Springer's Berlin offices, where Bezos is to be presented with an award for their "visionary entrepreneurship" in online business and digitalization strategy at the Washington Post.
Nahles argued that Amazon's tax practices and working conditions aren't worthy of a prize.
 They are seeking to boost their party's profile after a disastrous election result last year and its decision to enter the new German government as conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel's junior partner.
"I love New York, and today I'm announcing my candidacy for governor," Nixon said via Twitter.

North Melbourne aimed for the stars when they threw millions at out-of-contract guns Dustin Martin and Josh Kelly last year.
Neither took the bait, and the Kangaroos appear to be in for more growing pains before they return to the top-eight conversation.
The Roos crashed from eighth in 2016 to 15th last year and most critics are predicting the tumble to continue, with many pencilling them in for the wooden spoon.
Chairman Ben Buckley has already indicated the club will have another big crack at available free agents in 2018.
However, this is the start of a rebuild for North, who have secured just two top-20 draft picks in the past three seasons.
They require more high-end selections, but coach Brad Scott is nevertheless backing in the next wave of talent that has been brought in via the later rounds of the national draft.
Plenty of excitement surr-ounds last year's No.4 choice Luke Davies-Uniacke, who many experts viewed as a possible No.1 selection entering the draft.
The 18-year-old looms as an early debutant after impressing during practice matches and agreed to a two-year contract extension this month.
Leadership group members Shaun Higgins and Robbie Tarr-ant also extended their contracts during the pre-season in a strong show of faith in the club's direction.
Tall forward Ben Brown kicked a career-best 63 goals last year, but just failed to earn an All-Australian call-up.

That said, the 25-year-old is a player on the rise heading into their fifth season and is one of the few A-graders the Kangaroos can boast.
Paul Ahern, traded in from Greater Western Sydney in 2016, has had a strong summer after spending all of last year recovering from a second knee reconstruction and the 2014 first-round draft pick is poised to offer return on investment with a solid preparation under their belt.
Youngsters Alex Morgan, Ryan Clarke, Josh Williams, Mitchell Hibberd and Jy Simpkin will be expected to develop.
And Billy Hartung, granted a lifeline via the draft, should add speed to the midfield after being axed by Hawthorn.
One of North's big downfalls last season was their inability to close out tight games.
They lost five of their six decided by single-figure marg-ins, which ultimately put a severe dent in what turned into a disappointing 6-16 win-loss record.
One of those losses came when Todd Goldstein failed to convert a late free kick against Fremantle.
There is plenty of focus on the 29-year-old ruckman again as they look to recapture their 2015 All-Australian form, with Braydon Preuss offering another capable option should the Kangaroos require it.
Majak Daw, now into their eighth season, has been unable to cement a position as a forward or ruckman and is set for a switch into defence as they look to finally lock down a spot at senior level.
But they face stiff competition for spots alongside the likes of Tarrant, Daniel Nielson, Scott Thompson, Jamie Macmillan, Sam Wright and Marley Williams. Daw's inclusion could come down to a horses-for-courses selection policy.
Scott, who steered North to consecutive preliminary finals in 2014 and 2015, is in it for the long haul.
The club extended their deal until 2020 after speculation they would depart. They need to weave their magic.

São Paulo State-controlled Banco do Brasil (BBAS3.SA) is conducting a thorough revision of supply contracts and operational processes to streamline expenses, an area that has kept management "very uneasy," Chief Executive Officer Paulo Rogêrio Caffarelli said on Thursday.
In an interview, Caffarelli said their team is "tidying up the house to cut redundancies wherever they are and readjust that cost structure downwards." Banco do Brasil has targeted general and administrative expense growth between 1.5 percent and 4.5 percent for this year.
Caffarelli said that they would like to bring down Banco do Brasil's expenses, regardless of the minimum 8 percent pay raise stemming from a collective bargaining agreement for this year. A list of steps that they announced in November, including a voluntary retirement plan for over 9,000 employees and the closure of over 400 branches, could deliver 2.3 billion reais ($731 million) in cost savings this year, they added.
"I'm not comfortable at all with that guidance," Caffarelli said of the expense growth target, which executives vowed in February to keep at the lowest end of the range.
The cost-cutting initiative that Caffarelli has championed is part of efforts to bring Banco do Brasil's return on equity (ROE) above fundraising costs. Such a tack, which includes focussing on domestic lending and stepping up digital banking, has spurred a 94 percent surge in shares of Brazil's No. 2 bank since May last year, when they took over.
Even as banks continue to wrestle with Brazil's harshest recession ever and fallout from a corruption probe into state firms and large corporate borrowers, Caffarelli is spotting signs of recovery in certain consumer lending segments. They noted that disbursements of payroll-deductible loans are growing this year at the fastest pace in more than three years.
BANCO PATAGONIA
By putting profitability above market share, Caffarelli is also trying to reduce Banco do Brasil's return-on-equity gap with private-sector peers and giving the lender room to generate capital organically.
ROE has remained at single-digit numbers for an entire year, and it came in at 7.2 percent in the fourth quarter - about one-third of larger rival Itaú Unibanco Holding SA's (ITUB4.SA) 21 percent and a fraction of smaller peer Banco Bradesco SA's (BBDC4.SA) in the period.
A revival of credit among individuals and companies will be slow, they said. Confidence and activity indicators have recently shown improved readings, but data suggests credit markets face more headwinds, they noted.
The bank expects no "single-case corporate borrower" forcing it to set aside extra loan-loss provisions in the first quarter, Caffarelli said.
Lending-related activities contribute to 60 percent of Banco do Brasil's profit, although fee-related income is responsible for the bank's most profitable business lines.
As such, Banco do Brasil is inclined to sell unessential assets and keep those that generate fee income. Banco do Brasil's only option for the sale of a stake in Argentina's Banco Patagonia SA (BPAT.BA) remains a follow-on equity offering, they said.
The creation of a new vice presidency spot, which will soon be proposed to Banco do Brasil's board, will come at "zero cost" and may help enhance the alignment of interests between the bank and listed insurance unit BB Seguridade Participações SA (BBSE3.SA), Caffarelli said.
"To me, the move makes all sense because the unit is a relevant generator of fee income for the bank, and it will cost us nothing to create it," Caffarelli said.
Speculation about the creation of that position triggered a 4.4 percent slump in Banco do Brasil's stock on Thursday.

The family of retired primary school teacher Dorothy Cruickshank, who died in hospital on April 15 following a crash on the A90 near the Toll of Birness junction on Wednesday, April 5, have said they are "completely broken and devastated" by their loss.
In a statement they said: "Dorothy always had a smile on face. They were a proud mum of three daughters and a devoted nanna.
"We are completely broken and devastated by the loss of our kind, caring, adorable and loving mum who was also an amazing wife and the best nanna in the world.
"We'll be lost without them and no words can express how much pain we are feeling.
"We would like to express our sincere thanks to the emergency services and the staff at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary Accident and Emergency, Intensive Care and High Dependency Units for all their care and support."
Optus Stadium management has belatedly acknowledged growing feedback from players concerned about its surface and locked out clubs from training at the ground for three weeks in a bid to make the oval softer.
Sydney coach John Longmire became the latest coach to voice their concerns about the ground after confirming Lance Franklin would miss the Swans' game at Geelong on Saturday.
They have battled a heel injury since their round one win over West Coast at Optus Stadium.
The news followed serious leg injuries to West Coast youngsters Liam Ryan (ankle) and Daniel Venables (ankle), Fremantle pair Bradley Hill (knee) and Matt Taberner (foot), plus Geelong's Nakia Cockatoo (knee) and Cam Guthrie (ankle).
West Coast chief executive Trevor Nisbett revealed discussions between the clubs, the AFL and Optus Stadium management on Monday led to a decision to deny access for training sessions for three weeks to give the surface time to be rectified.
A stadium spokesperson insisted yesterday its testing complied with AFL requirements but said it had listened to the clubs and decided to act.
“While the surface success-fully meets and in fact tests at the softer end of the required AFL standards, some players have reported the ground feels firm by comparison to the old Subiaco Oval,” they said.
“Optus Stadium management takes this feedback very seriously. The rye grass was sown into the turf in February ahead of the AFL season and as it continues to grow, it will ultimately assist to make the surface feel softer.

“In order for the rye to have the best possible conditions to grow, the AFL, West Coast Eagles and Fremantle Dockers have agreed to conduct training sessions away from Optus Stadium for the next three weeks.
“The away teams in rounds seven and eight, Port Adelaide and St Kilda, have also agreed with this plan and will train elsewhere.”
Nisbett said the club understood the challenges with laying new turf. They and Fremantle chief executive Steve Rosich were prepared to accept that the spate of injuries hadn't been directly caused by the surface.
Despite the testing results indicating there wasn't an issue, Nisbett said it was important to check other parts of the oval given players were telling them that Optus Stadium was the hardest ground in the AFL.
Duff and Quarters talk about whether something needs to be done about the surface at Optus Stadium following John Longmire's comments. The West Australian Video Duff and Quarters talk about whether something needs to be done about the surface at Optus Stadium following John Longmire's comments.
“Currently the players are saying that it is,” Nisbett said.
“We've had the opportunity to play on Etihad this year, which is normally the hardest surface and the toughest to recover from. Certainly at this stage, they are saying Optus is a tad harder and it takes them a bit longer to recover.
“The clubs who have played here and the boys who have played with our club certainly think it's a harder surface than they've played on.”
AFL football operations manager Steve Hocking said it sought assurances from Optus Stadium management that measures were being taken to soften the surface. Clubs had taken their concerns to the league since the stadium opened this year.
“It's certainly something that the coaches are talking about,” Hocking said.
“Players are so finely tuned now. They notice the variation from ground to ground and there are so many different grounds that they play at.”
March 19 (UPI) -- Thousands of people in Britain dressed in the iconic red and white of Where's Waldo? braved the cold to run for a literacy charity.
The National Literacy Trust said thousands of people dressed as Waldo -- known as Wally in Britain -- and ran in 5k and 10k events in London's Clapham Common on Sunday.
The event went on as planned despite colder than usual temperatures, which brought snow to the area.
The National Literacy Trust's Fun Run raised money for the charity, which promotes literacy in the country.
The Maryland Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Administration (MDOT MVA) Maryland Highway Safety Office (MHSO) is teaming with State Farm® for Making It Click, a grant-funded program promoting seat belt usage among young drivers and passengers. Car crashes are the number-one killer of teens in the United States. In 2016, more than one in three young drivers killed in crashes were unbelted.
“Wearing a seat belt is your best defense in a crash,” said MDOT MVA Administrator and Governor Larry Hogan's Highway Safety Representative Christine Nizer. “Creating a seat belt culture that encourages your friends and peers to buckle up every time they get in a vehicle only helps to reinforce this life-saving habit.”
Making It Click runs through May 31. Eight Maryland high schools and one college are participating in this new peer-led program. Schools are required to complete observational seat belt surveys at the beginning and end of the program. With toolkits provided by the MDOT MHSO, students will be able to creatively compete against other schools to raise awareness of always buckling up. Students can create posters, videos, memes, flyers, and other materials; sign pledge cards; and share their ideas about illustrating seat belt use and highway safety in school and through social media.
The participating schools are:
• Archbishop Spalding High School (Anne Arundel County)
• Calvert High School (Calvert County)
• Center for Applied Technology North (Anne Arundel County)
• Digital Harbor High School (Baltimore City)
• Eleanor Roosevelt High School (Prince George's County)
• Kent Island High School (Queen Anne's County)
• McDaniel College (Carroll County)
• St. Mary's High School (Anne Arundel County)
• Washington Academy and High School (Somerset County)
The MHSO will recognize the school with the largest increase in seat belt use at the end of the program.

"While they will not be attending the July 4th celebrations, Mr. Singh knows that it will take more than symbolic gestures to successfully pressure the Trump administration," James Smith said in an email.
Goldfeder said they don't think the boycotts will impact the feel of the party at all.
"There are a handful of people who have decided to make this a comment on the Canada-U.S. relationship and that's fair," they said.
"They're all in good, safe places to make that comment, but it's for their purposes. I don't think anyone realistically has an expectation that that's something the U.S. administration — especially this one — would be all that impressed by."
Communications staff at the U.S. embassy have not yet responded to a request for comment about the party or the boycott. In Ireland, where several Irish MPs have made a show of boycotting the Fourth of July party in Dublin, the senior U.S. official at the embassy there suggested such a move was counterproductive.
“Everybody has the right to express themselves and how they do it, but I'm a firm believer in dialogue," said Reece Smyth, the deputy chief of the U.S. mission in Dublin, which hasn't had an ambassador since Trump took office in January 2017.
"Even when we disagree, I think the dialogue needs to continue as that is the only way we can come to an agreement,” Smyth told the Irish Times newspaper.
Ottawa-area MP Andrew Leslie, the government's parliamentary secretary for U.S.-Canada relations, is scheduled to attend. And Conservative defence critic James Bezan is flying back to Ottawa specifically for the party.
"It's our chance to go and celebrate Independence Day with the Americans and demonstrate we're friends," said Bezan.
"Members of families sometimes have difficulties, and we have to find a way to work through this."

The two British volunteer rescue divers who found a Thai soccer team trapped in a flooded cave network are well acquainted with harrowing rescue attempts.
John Volanthen and Richard "Rick" Stanton are expert cave divers skilled in navigating perilous underwater passages, a colleague says -- and they've been called abroad before to help with difficult rescues.
On Monday, Volanthen and Stanton found 12 boys and their soccer coach alive some nine days after the team went missing -- up to 1 kilometer underground in a narrow cave system in northern Thailand.
"Many people are coming," one of the divers told the group. The men reported their discovery to Thai authorities running the search, and Thai Navy SEALs have been tending to the soccer team while officials develop plans to extricate the group.
The BBC reported that Volanthen is an IT consultant from Bristol, and Stanton is a retired firefighter from Coventry.
Both have extensive cave diving experience and are members of a volunteer team -- the British Cave Rescue Council -- that makes itself available for rescue efforts around the world, BCRC liaison officer Chris Jewell said.
Jewell talked to both men on Monday night, after they exited the cave.
"Rick and John installed a guideline -- a line that can then be subsequently followed by the Thai Navy SEALs," Jewell said in a Skype interview with CNN from Manchester, England.
The men left behind a couple of lights and some food before heading back, Jewell said.
"Rick and John have now stepped back from operational diving whilst the Thai Navy SEALs continue to conduct work in the cave, making multiple trips to the boys to drop off supplies and look after them whilst they plan the extraction," they said.
'Few cave divers in the world have (their) skills'
Both men have been honored for their previous rescue work.
In October 2010, the volunteers were called to France, where they tried to find a diver who didn't re-emerge after exploring a submerged cave more than a kilometer long.
Any exploration was difficult, requiring specialized equipment and "lengthy, planned decompression stops," an account from the UK's Royal Humane Society said.
The missing man had been the only person to ever explore the chamber beyond 700 meters, and they were trying to go beyond that when they disappeared.
"Few cave divers in the world have the skills and equipment to follow this man, and the nearest were Richard and John," the society's account said.
After multiple dives, Volanthen and Stanton found a way past a blockage and discovered the diver's body.
Princess Alexandra awarded them a Royal Humane Society medal at Buckingham Palace for the rescue attempt in 2012.
Stanton also helped with a rescue of 13 British cavers in Mexico in 2004, the BBC reported. The firefighter was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire at the end of 2012 for services to local government.
'A gnarly dive'
Their skills were on display Monday. One of the divers described their work in an email to a BCRC official.
"The description in their email was it was a bit of a gnarly dive, which means there were complications and problems," said Bill Whitehouse, the council's vice chairperson. "Quite a strong flow, current, so they're having to swim against the current and pull themselves along the walls. The visibility in the water wouldn't have been very good."
Volanthen's mother, Jill Volanthen, told the BBC they had "absolute pride" in their son's work, and they felt "absolute relief" for the children.
"But I don't think it's all over yet. Let them get them out first," they said of the trapped team.

DETROIT (WWJ) – Did you get a pair of solar eclipse safety glasses for next week's big event? You'll want to double-check to see if they're legit.
Experts say while there's no risk to your health if you're outside going about your business during the eclipse, you can run into problems if you look up at the sun with your naked eye.
And it doesn't take long, said Dr. Gina Lynem with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan.
“A few seconds can cause damage like a sunburn to the eye that happens and some people can develop permanent blindness from that,” they told WWJ Health Reporter Dr. Deanna Lites.
To view the eclipse safely you'll need genuine eclipse glasses that have met international safety standards. Some, which have been sold on eBay and elsewhere online, may not adequately protect you.
To make sure that your glasses and solar viewers are safe, the American Astronomical Society has posted a rundown of reputable vendors. You can find a complete list of manufacturers and authorized dealers of eclipse glasses and handheld solar viewers verified to be compliant with the ISO 12312-2 international safety standard for such products at this link.
Also, check with your local library. Some will be providing glasses free glasses.
In metro Detroit, the partial eclipse begins at 1:03 p.m. on Monday, Aug. 21, will hit its peak at 2:27 p.m., and will be done at 3:47 p.m. (Learn more).
UPDATE 7-UPS shooting leaves four dead, including gunman, in San Francisco
SAN FRANCISCO, June 14 A UPS driver armed with a handgun opened fire at a United Parcel Service Inc package-sorting center in San Francisco on Wednesday, killing three people before fatally shooting themselves as officers closed in.
RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - Newly released law enforcement video shows officers tackling and punching a man in an altercation that led to assault charges against two North Carolina state troopers and a sheriff's deputy.
Dashboard camera video from one of the first troopers to arrive shows Kyron Hinton standing alone on April 3, moaning and gesturing on a Raleigh street. Officers from multiple agencies then surround him.
Eventually a canine handler approaches, and the dog lunges and gets a mouthful of Hinton's clothing. The canine handler then tackles Hinton. While Hinton is on the ground, at least one officer can be seen punching him.
The videos were released Wednesday to media outlets who went to court to request they be made public.
Two troopers and a deputy were charged with assault earlier this month.
ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — Jabrill Peppers perhaps played out of position at Michigan last season, lining up as a linebacker even though they seemed most suited to play safety in the NFL.
They made enough plays to become a Heisman Trophy finalist as a junior and to determine they were ready to play in the league.
Timing might work against Peppers, though, because he's projected to be taken after LSU's Jamal Davis and Ohio State's Malik Hooker. Those two safeties are expected to be among the top selections next week, and no one appears to be sure when Peppers will be taken.
“It's unfortunate that he's coming out in a year where there are so many good safeties,” NFL draft consultant and former Dallas Cowboys general manager Gil Brandt said. “Under normal conditions, he'd probably be the No. 1 safety, but the Ohio State and the LSU guys are so good.

“He's a tremendous football player. They find a way to makes things happen. Even though they only had one interception at Michigan, they find a way to make a big play, whether it's a sack off a blitz or on a punt return.”
Brandt believes Peppers is talented enough to potentially be drafted in the middle of the first round, but won't be surprised if he's available early in the second round. Even though Peppers was pushed out of their comfort zone last season, Brandt does not think it affected their value to NFL teams.
“The only thing that hurts them a little bit is they don't have very good hands,” Brandt said. “At pro day, they dropped about three passes.”
Bleacher Report NFL analyst Chris Simms said Peppers was the “most overrated ,” prospect in the draft last week and the proud player fired back the next day on Twitter.
“I played out of position (LB @ 200lbs) pounds, and still became an American,” Peppers tweeted . “How many players can/ARE WILLING to do that for their team?”
The 5-foot-11, 213-pound Peppers declined an interview Saturday while walking up the tunnel out of Michigan Stadium after the school's spring game. But they acknowledged last month that it is fair to question where they will play in the league because there isn't a lot of tape of them at safety. Peppers was primarily used as a nickel cornerback as a sophomore in 2015.
Coach Jim Harbaugh had them return punts and kickoffs and play on offense, putting them in as a wildcat quarterback, running back and wide receiver.
“I've had one team tell me they want me to play linebacker,” Peppers said in March at Michigan's pro day. “One team told me they thought I should play offense. Other than that it's, ‘you're a safety.' … No one's come into a room and said, ‘Jabrill, we don't know what to do with you.' “
Speed, it seems, will be an asset for Peppers.
They ran a 4.46 40-yard dash at the scouting combine, showing off the form that helped them in high school become a New Jersey state champion in track. In games, whether returning a punt for a touchdown or a fumble on a 2-point conversion, they simply looked like a blur at times.
Peppers didn't play in Michigan's 33-32 loss to Florida State in the Orange Bowl because of an injured left hamstring, but has proven he's healthy during a string of visits with NFL teams.
They led a team stacked with NFL-caliber players with 16 tackles for losses last season and ranked third with 72 tackles. They also had four sacks, one interception and forced a fumble. On offense, Peppers had 27 carries for 167 yards, caught two passes and scored three touchdowns. They returned a punt for a score in a win over Colorado, averaged a Big Ten-best 14.8 yards on punt returns, and gained 26 yards per kickoff return.
They won the Hornung Award as the nation's most versatile college football player, and the Lott Trophy, which honors a defensive player for character and performance.
“Whatever team takes me, it's going to be a steal,” Peppers said. “I don't care what the draft experts — and things like that — what they have to say. I only care about what these GMs and coaches think about me. I just need the opportunity. That's it.
“I didn't play safety, but I'm going to be a safety.”

BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — Wildlife advocates plan to challenge the approval of a new Yellowstone River dam to benefit farmers that critics say could kill off a dwindling population of a fish dating to the time of dinosaurs.
A bypass channel for the irrigation dam would be built near the Montana-North Dakota border to let endangered pallid sturgeon reach upstream spawning grounds.
But scientists don't know if the fish would use the channel.
Wildearth Guardians and the Natural Resources Defense Council said in a court filing Friday they are negotiating with officials on how to proceed following last month's dam construction approval by the U.S Army Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation.
The groups have a lawsuit pending over the $57 million project.
LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Tuesday rejected the appeal of Imran Ali, who was convicted by an anti-terrorism court (ATC) for the rape and murder of seven-year-old Zainab Amin of Kasur, against the verdict that handed them death penalty on four counts.
An appellate bench of the high court upheld the conviction of appellant Imran Ali by an ATC.
In their appeal, that was submitted in the high court on February 20 by jail officials, Ali claimed that they are innocent.
“The trial was conducted in haste and legal requirements were not fulfilled during the trial,” Ali said in their appeal while asking the court to overturn the ATC's verdict.
On February 17, an ATC found Imran Ali guilty of the charges brought against him, and handed them four counts of the death penalty, one life term, a 7-year jail term and Rs 4.1 million in fines.
The four death penalties were for kidnapping, raping and murdering Zainab, and for committing an act of terrorism under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
ATA's section 7 (a) reads: “Death of any person is caused, shall be punishable, on conviction, with death or with imprisonment for life, and with fine.”
The life sentence, along with a Rs1 million fine, was handed to Ali for sodomy; another 7-year jail sentence and Rs1 million fine were imposed for disrespecting the dead body by throwing it in a trash heap.
Additionally, Rs1 million from the penalties imposed will be paid to the victim's heirs, the judge ruled.
Ali faces further charges in the cases of at least seven other children they attacked — five of whom were murdered — in a spate of assaults that had stoked fears a serial child killer was on the loose. They have confessed to all eight attacks, including the death of Zainab.
Zainab's rape and murder had sparked outrage and protests across the country after the minor child, who went missing on January 4, was found dead in a trash heap in Kasur on Jan 9.
Them case was the twelfth such incident to occur within a 10-kilometre radius in the city over a 12-month period.

The Trump Administration is giving insurance companies an extra three weeks to decide whether to offer insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act markets, and how much to charge.
The extension comes as insurance companies wait for Trump to decide whether they will continue to make payments to insurance companies that are called for under the Affordable Care Act, but that some Republicans have opposed.
The payments – known as cost-sharing reduction payments – reimburse insurance companies for discounts on copayments and deductibles that they're required by law to offer to low-income customers. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the payments this year would be about $7 billion.
Trump has said they may end the reimbursements, which they call "bailouts," and has been leaving insurers to wonder month-to-month about whether they will receive a check.
A White House spokesperson says Trump is "working with their staff and their cabinet to consider the issues raised by the CSR payments."
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says it's offering the extra time so insurance companies can plan ahead in case the government decides to end the payments. In a memo Friday, the agency said many states are now requiring companies to file their rates for 2018 on the assumption that they won't be reimbursed.
Several companies say that without the cost-sharing payments, their rates will see double-digit increases. For example, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina says ending the payments would push its rates up 14.1 percent.
The HHS memo says "there have been no changes regarding HHS's ability to make cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers."
But it then says the agency intends to change the ACA's risk adjustment program to compensate for the loss of cost-sharing payments.
The changes are technical and complex, but Timothy Jost, professor emeritus at Washington & Lee University's law school, says in a Health Affairs blog that the memo just deepens the confusion.
"We still do not know if all of this is needed or not — the Trump administration has not made up its mind," they say.
The cost-sharing payments have been at the center of a political battle over the Affordable Care Act since before President Trump took office.
House Republicans opposed to the health law sued then-President Obama, saying the payments are illegal because Congress hadn't appropriated money for them. A judge agreed but allowed the administration to continue making the payments during an appeal.
Now that Trump is in the White House, and Republican efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act have failed, many Republicans are urging the president to continue the payments rather than undermine the health care markets.
Prepregs are composite materials, wherein a reinforcement fiber is pre-impregnated with a thermoplastic or thermoset resin matrix in a certain ratio. Prepregs offer unique properties, as they are manufactured by curing under high temperatures and pressures. The resin matrix in prepregs is partially cured for easy handling and is stored at cool temperature to prevent complete polymerization. The fiber often takes the form of a weave, and the matrix is used to bond them together and to other components during manufacture.
Request Report Brochure @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=22772
Based on fiber, the prepreg market has been segmented into carbon, aramid, and glass. The carbon fiber segment accounted for significant share of the global prepreg market in 2015 owing to the wide applications in different end-use industries. Glass fiber segment is expected to experience high growth rate, led by the increase in demand for automotive interior. Changes in consumer preferences and rise in disposable income are anticipated to boost the demand for prepregs during the forecast period.
In terms of region, the global prepreg market has been divided into Asia Pacific, North America, Europe, Middle East & Africa, and Latin America. Asia Pacific accounted for key share of the prepreg market in 2015, followed by North America and Europe. The market for prepreg in Asia Pacific is estimated to expand due to the rise in demand for composites in various end-use sectors such as aerospace & defense, wind, sporting goods, automotive, and electronics. Automotive held prominent share of the prepreg market in 2015. The prepreg market is driven by the rising demand for interior designing.
Read Report Overview @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/prepreg-market.html
Increase in disposable income of consumers in North America and Europe is projected to boost the prepreg market in these regions. The U.S. and the U.K. are likely to constitute major share of the prepreg market in North America and Europe, respectively, due to the high disposable income of the people in these regions and new product launches. The prepreg market is anticipated to witness a shift from the U.S., and Western Europe, to the developing economies in Asia Pacific, led by high demand for composites in the automotive sector. The prepreg market in developing economies in Asia, namely China and India, is also likely to expand at a rapid pace due to the increase in income and changing lifestyle of consumers. Technological advancements and innovations of new products are also likely to boost the demand for prepregs during the forecast period.

Tooth loss can affect a person's confidence when they smile, making them feel embarrassed by the gaps.
[LONDON, 4/7/2018] – It can even interrupt the fluency of someone's lifestyle, in how they eat and speak. No wonder then that for centuries people have been trying to find ways to replace lost teeth, the latest being dental implants at Aura Dental.
Dental implants at Aura Dental come very close to perfect mimicry of nature. Dental implants at Aura Dental serve to restore people's smiles after they have lost one several or all of their teeth. They also give back the pleasures of eating without discomfort and speaking without worry.
The journey of treatment with dental implants at Aura Dental
In North London, dental implants at Aura Dental simulate the functions of natural teeth. The body treats the small titanium screw like a natural part, healing around it and integrating it with the jawbone. Over time, it becomes secure enough to have a replacement tooth fitted on top. Dental implants at Aura Dental can each support up to three teeth on a bridge, and, combined, can be used to replace an entire arch of teeth.
Someone who has been burdened with loose dentures for a long time after tooth loss may grow tired of worrying about their teeth falling out when they smile or laugh. Dental implants at Aura Dental can be used to secure dentures and stop them from sliding around in the mouth.
If a person goes into the dentist looking for a quick solution to their missing teeth, they may like the sound of teeth in a day. This means replacing their teeth with a temporary bridge after the dental implants at Aura Dental have been fitted into the jawbone. Once the implants have properly fused with the jawbone, about four to six months later, a permanent bridge will be fitted onto the dental implants at Aura Dental.
Restoring the joys of food and smiles
Receiving dental implants at Aura Dental is beneficial for the oral health and appearance of a person's smile. They will no longer be restrained by the discomfort of missing teeth when they bite and chew, allowing them to order what they like on the dinner menu.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A UPS employee opened fire at a San Francisco package delivery facility on Wednesday, killing three employees and then themselves as officers closed in, police said.
San Francisco assistant police chief Toney Chaplin said a news conference that two other employees were wounded in the shooting that prompted a massive police response in downtown San Francisco.
Police have not determined a motive. Chaplin said that the shooter was armed with an assault pistol and put the weapon to their head and pulled the trigger when police found him.
UPS spokesperson Steve Gaut told The Associated Press that the shooter was an employee who opened fire inside the facility before the drivers were sent out to do their normal daily deliveries.
Neighbors said they heard up to eight rapid gunshots.
“It was like tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, tat,” said Raymond Deng, who lives across the street from the warehouse.
After the gunfire, auto shop owner Robert Kim said they saw “a mob of UPS drivers” running down the street screaming “shooter, shooter.”
Deng, 30, a data scientist for a start-up company, also saw workers fleeing and another group of about 10 who gathered on the roof and held their hands up as police arrived.
“I saw police officers go up from the ramp and then storm the buildings,” they said. “It's crazy.”
Police responding to the facility in the Potrero Hill neighborhood, about 2 ½ miles from downtown San Francisco, found wounded victims and pulled them to safety. Then they found the gunman, who killed himself.
Investigators recovered two firearms from the scene.
Uniformed UPS employees were later led out in a line by officers next to a highway. They walked away calmly with emergency vehicles nearby and gathered nearby outside a restaurant.
It came the same day a gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers at a congressional baseball practice, wounding U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana and several others.
The ongoing eruption of Mount Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has been changing Hawaii's landscape, turning the tropical paradise into a living hell, with rivers of lava pouring into the ocean.
As the infamous Kilauea volcano keeps spewing lava for the third month in a row, Hawaii's Kapoho Bay has been completely filled with pasty lava oozing into the ocean, which has created 555 acres (some 2.25 square kilometers) of new land, the US Geological Survey tweeted on Tuesday.

The ocean entry point is a hazardous area, scientists warn. "Venturing too close to an ocean entry on land or the ocean exposes you to flying debris from sudden explosive interaction between lava and water," the USGS noted.

Kilauea, one of the most active volcanoes in the world, is located on the Big Island of Hawaii. The latest eruption began in early May and has destroyed over 650 homes ever since.
More than 2,000 local residents have been evacuated since the volcano started spurting lava, marking one of the most dramatic volcanic eruptions in modern times.
CINEMATIC TEASER: British designer Gareth Pugh has released a cinematic teaser ahead of their fall show, which takes place during London Fashion Week. Pugh will stage a runway show at 8 p.m. in Collins Music Hall in Islington Green on Feb 18.
Filmed in black and white, the production was directed by Ruth Hogben and Andrea Gelardin, who worked with creative consultant Carson McColl.
The film — which runs in under three minutes — opens up to a phrase from William Shakespeare's King Lear, “‘Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind.” The movie features Latin American singer and songwriter Rebekah Del Rio singing “Llorando,” a Spanish-version of Roy Orbison's “Crying” in a cappella. The “Mulholland Drive” star — wearing a fur coat — is pictured performing outdoors at an apartment complex.
Pugh said the moment was as “an iconic visual conceit, and a fitting metaphor for truth in a post-truth arena and a vision of a world on the precipice of anarchy.”
No stranger to a theatrical display, the designer's spring show held last September took a cue from the opera. In addition, the designer unveiled more than 60 costumes on the stage of Palais Garnier in Paris.

COLUMBUS, Ga. — Parents say it seems to be a growing trend in our schools. Innocent children being attacked and bullied by fellow classmates.
It was the first day of summer school at Spencer High when Tiffany Leathers says their son was bullied.
“Aaron was scared to come forth at first. When they did come forth they were crying and upset and they had said they had gotten bullied,” says Tiffany Leathers, who claims their son was bullied.
They want to get the word out to other parents that there are bullies even in our summer schools.
“It just devastates me because they are fourteen and when you go to school you shouldn't have to worry about that. These children need to be there to learn they shouldn't have to be there worrying about getting bullied,” says Tiffany Leathers.
Leathers have hired an attorney to help fight for their son.
“Any mother whose child comes home would want to ask questions in regards to what happened and out of fear they mentioned that they had somehow caused this harm to himself,” says Attorney Teddy Reese.
News 3 will continue to follow the recovery of the student and bring you any new developments.

× Fire Forces Four From Apartment Building in Luzerne County
WILKES-BARRE TOWNSHIP — Four people need a new place to stay after their apartment building went up in flames in Luzerne County.
Flames on Pulaski Street near Wilkes-Barre could be seen for miles when the home caught fire just before 1:30 Wednesday morning.
Everyone made it out safely, but one of those tenants lost their cat.
A neighbor spotted the flames and called for help.
“I ran down the street. I saw flames coming out of the house. I called 911 and I saw people and they said everyone got out safely,” said William Gates of Wilkes-Barre Township.
The fire marshal is expected to look into how that fire got its start in Luzerne County.

On 29th March 2019 Britain will almost certainly leave the EU. Sign up to The Local's Brexit & You newsletter for the latest on how Britain's departure is affecting the EU's remaining 27 member states – and the Brits living in them.
Brexit & You will be your weekly guide to how the 27 remaining member states of the EU are preparing for the exit of one of the union's largest and most recalcitrant members.
Every Friday, multilingual correspondent Alex Macbeth will bring you weekly news and reflections from around Europe.
What we won't do is give you yet another take on the Brexit negotiations in Brussels (the latest round ended on Thursday, and was 'constructive' according to EU negotiator Michel Barnier), Theresa May's rows with their colleagues or Labour's attempts to paper over the cracks in its Brexit policy. What we will do is tell you how the rest of Europe is dealing with a situation that it didn't ask for, but is having to confront – and how Brits on the continent are managing.
And we're going to strive to make it constructive: Brexit might be bad news for many of us, but we're going to keep this practical and (mostly) non-whiny.

Busting a move: A sneaky guide to cheating Brexit
The rights of British citizens in the EU and vice-versa are at stake in the Brexit negotiations. But how can Brits continue to live and do business in the EU after Brexit, regardless of the outcome?
Brits who didn't know what the European Union was before Brexit are going to find it much harder to discover the continent after.
Brexit melts away the privilege of moving seamlessly to and between Britain's estranged EU cousins.
If the awkward compound noun wasn't a term used to describe Britain's self-imposed European exile it could easily be the name of a toilet bowl cleaner or a Brazilian mining company.
Whatever it turns out to be, it will throw a spanner in the plans of 1.2 million or so Brits living in 25 Schengen states.
While nobody is getting kicked out of anywhere until at least 2019, Brits may well find they need to fulfil several conditions to haggle an invite to the European Union's free-for-all house party – the Schengen Zone – thereafter.
Phrasebooks, a taste for strange cheeses and basic differentiation of euro coins are enough to surf Europe now, but Brits are going to find their access to the continent heavily restricted after Brexit.
The worst news is it may yet take both sides of politicians in the Brexit negotiations another 18 months to decide who can live where and how.
Britain has suggested two-to-five-year residency terms for EU residents in the UK after Brexit; voices in the EU have said Brits may be able to obtain residency in one EU country but without the Schengen privileges of moving without a visa or a passport to another.
Some EU countries however are already actively recruiting British citizens. Estonia has launched How To Stay In, a website geared towards Brits with information on how to establish an EU company through the country's e-residence programme.
“The Brexit referendum led to a sharp increase in applications for e-Residency from the UK, with twice as much demand as before the referendum,” Arnaud Castaignet, head of Estonia's E-Residency Programme, told The Local. “We currently have 1,307 e-residents from the UK,” adds Castaignet. “We surpassed 1,000 in the week that Article 50 was triggered.”
The British e-residents have so far established 103 companies in Estonia without having to relocate from the UK. Estonia's e-residency programme offers global citizens the opportunity to set up a company online for €100 and benefit from being able to trade as an EU company.
Online residency will help your goods reach Europe, but you yourself will only be there virtually as the program does not entail the right to actually live in Estonia.
Malta will however actually let you move to its warm Mediterranean shores, albeit for an annual fee of €15,000, or just over €41 per day.
Anybody wanting to move to the archipelago will need to either rent a place for a minimal annual value of €8,750 or buy an outright property at no less than €220,000, according to Zentura Ltd, a consultancy firm that facilitates applications for Maltese residency and citizenship.
If you have the money and are willing to spend it, most countries will offer residency, or even citizenship, as part of an investor program. Cyprus has allegedly been selling passports to pretty much anyone who can afford one, reported the Guardian, while Greece, Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania will all be happy to play host if you buy a house worth at least €250,000.
Or you could make a hefty investment; buy a second division football club or fund an innovative chain of hairdressers in your country of choice.
Don't fancy the hefty price tag or the bad hair days? Germany will give you a passport for a mere €255. But only once you've lived in the country for eight years.
Can Brexit help Sweden discover the next PayPal or TransferWise?
Sweden hopes to cash in on the fintech exodus from London.
One country's loss is another's gain. Stockholm has set its sights on picking up some of the fintech business that experts predict London is set to lose.
Cobcoe's report outlines several ‘services' sectors threatened by Brexit. Financial services, as well as back office data, call centres and data storage are key areas where the UK will have to realign fast or risk seeing key companies relocate to Europe from hubs such as London and Cambridge.
Fintech, or technology and software used to enable banking and financial services, is another. The UK is still the leader in the sector in 2017, according a report by CBS Insights. But the same report warns that “fintech insurgents” could cash in on the UK's loss, with Sweden and France most poised to inherit sections of the financial technology market.
The Stockholm Fintech Hub is one such nascent player looking to wrestle business away from the UK in the highly-profitable start up sector. The 226 organizations in the Swedish fintech sector have attracted more than €750 million in funding already and employ more than 3,000 people, according to a recent post by Matthew Argent, founder of the Stockholm Fintech Hub.
“I have witnessed a seismic shift in activity within fintech in Sweden since we launched in February 2017,” writes Argent. “The country's tech unicorns are putting the country on the map as a viable destination for investment and this is influencing the fintech sector.”
Sum Up ready to pack up and leave London
Britain's fintech sector is nervous and some of the leading figures have already decided to relocate.
The founder of Sum Up, Daniel Klein, told Munich's Süddeutsche Zeitung they would be relocating the financial services provider from London to “elsewhere” because of fears about Brexit.
Sum Up, which employs more than 500 people, creates technology to authenticate chip card transactions (Visa, Mastercard etc). The company is UK-based and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
It operates in 31 countries and fears that with the UK out of the single market, it could lose its automatic access to many European markets and become a victim of regulatory divergence.
While London remains the fintech capital of Europe, with more than 1 billion invested into the sector alone in 2017, some of the 1600 or so companies that employ 60,000 people – according to the report – are beginning to fret about Brexit.
David Thomas of Cobcoe says talent must be protected in the Brexit negotiations because “if Europe loses this incredible pool of talent the damage to the economy is going to be immense.”
German trade guru: "I doubt Brexit will ever happen"
If a German business expert is to be believed, then there'll be no need to learn Maltese or file tax returns in Estonian to live on the Costa Brava.
"Agh, Brexit, it is all verbal so far; I doubt it will ever actually happen," said Anton Börner, president of BGA, The Federation of German Wholesale, Foreign Trade and Services, calling a hard Brexit's bluff in an interview with German daily Die Welt.
Börner based their doubts on the endurance of the UK economy and the resistance of stock markets to Brexit speculation.
"Market leaders assume that Brexit takes place in politicians' speeches, but not in reality," added Börner. "Whatever comes will be strongly cushioned in order not to overwhelm the economy."
British Ambassador slammed by Brits in France over Brexit
The British Ambassador to France has been on the sharp end of criticism from UK citizens in the country, who aren't buying their reassurances over Brexit.
British envoy Edward Llewelyn posted a video on the embassy's Facebook page in an attempt to update Brits in France on the ongoing Brexit negotiations and to stress there was good news to report back on the progress being made.
But the reaction was overwhelmingly hostile:
"The intransigence of the UK government is making people ill, we are being treated like bargaining chips,” one angry Brit commented, The Local France writes.
If you want to give your local British Ambassador a grilling, see the listings below for Embassy Brexit events (but before you get too angry, remember that diplomats are only doing the government's bidding!).

Further Reading The arcade world's first Easter egg discovered after fraught journey Here at Ars, we have a minor obsession with modern discoveries of Easter eggs from relatively ancient games. That includes a timing cue in Punch-Out!!, debug menus hidden in Mortal Kombat cabinets, and the first-ever Easter egg found in a game from 1977. But a Level Select Easter egg that involves physically hitting a Sonic 3D Blast Genesis cartridge—and the story behind it—is probably the weirdest such hidden feature we've ever heard of.
In a new video explanation, Traveller's Tales founder Jon Burt, who worked on 3D Blast and a number of Sega games back in the '90s, details how the unintended "smack the cartridge" Easter egg really grew out of an attempt to get around Sega's onerous certification requirements for Genesis cartridges.
As Burt explains it, Sega's certification process at the time took "a few weeks" and required re-submission for any failures, including crashes after the game was left running for days at a time. So Burt started catching any generalized, crash-worthy errors the game might trigger and disguising them as Easter eggs the player had stumbled on—such as a "secret time warp" that bounced the player around in Mickey Mania. As Burt recalls, "most things that were to crash the game just brought up the secret time warp, so Sega wouldn't know it was actually a bug."
For Sonic 3D Blast, Burt expanded this strategy to make use of a Vector table of all possible exceptions in the Genesis' Motorola 68000 processor (PDF). Whenever the processor encountered any such unexpected error—such as a divide by zero issue—the game would simply redirect to the Level Select code. "That way, if I'd missed anything that would normally crash the game... instead of crashing, the level select would appear and we'd breeze through Sega's submission process," Burt says. "And it worked, and we did."
Thus, when a player hits or wiggles the 3D Blast cartridge, the connection between the game and the console gets broken just long enough to throw a processor exception, which gets captured and thrown to the Level Select screen instead of causing a crash. It's enough to make us wonder what other cool features in classic games were just kludgy hacks to get around potential problems.
On July 4th, Americans celebrate our Declaration of Independence. But red, white and blue bedecked picnic tables and the “rockets' red glare” of fireworks displays get more attention than why our country's founding was both unique and important.
To reawaken our attention to those issues which make Americans' unique heritage, we could turn to Calvin Coolidge. Not only was they the only president born on the 4th of July, they honored the Declaration of Independence's commitment to life and liberty to pursue one's happiness, provided others' equally inalienable rights are not violated, more than any of their successors. Further, they produced remarkable results without sacrificing our freedoms. They cut tax rates, tax rolls and federal debt, and real economic growth averaged 7 percent, with 0.4 percent inflation and 3.3 percent unemployment, during their presidency.
In particular, Silent Cal's speech commemorating Independence Day's 150th anniversary merits reconsideration. Consider the following condensed version:
“We meet to celebrate the birthday of America … a service so great, which a few inspired men here rendered to humanity … the preeminent support of free government throughout the world.
“The Declaration of independence and the Constitution of the United States … [are] two great charters of freedom and justice.
“A new spirit had arisen on this side of the Atlantic more advanced and more developed in its regard for the rights of the individual.
“The American Revolution represented the informed and mature convictions of … independent, liberty-loving, God-fearing people who knew their rights, and possessed the courage to dare to maintain them.
“The Declaration of Independence was the result of the seasoned and deliberate thought of the dominant portion of the people of the Colonies … in no sense a radical movement but … resistance to illegal usurpations … to maintain their constitutional rights which from time immemorial had been guaranteed to them under the law of the land.
“The Declaration of Independence … had a much broader and deeper significance than a mere secession of territory and the establishment of a new nation … because it was proposed to establish a nation on new principles.
“Three very definite propositions were set out in its preamble regarding the nature of humankind and therefore of government. These were the doctrine that all men are created equal, that they are endowed with certain inalienable rights, and that therefore the source of the just powers of government must be derived from the consent of the governed … No advance, no progress can be made beyond these propositions.
“That our Declaration of Independence containing these immortal truths was the political action of a duly authorized and constituted representative public body in its sovereign capacity, supported by the force of general opinion … makes it the most important civil document in the world … a new nation was born which was to be founded upon those principles … an incomparable event in the history of government.
“True to the principles which were declared 150 years ago … The rights of the individual are held sacred and protected by constitutional guaranties, which even the Government itself is bound not to violate.
“The fathers made their declaration and adopted their Constitution … to establish a free government, which must not be permitted to degenerate into the unrestrained authority of a mere majority or the unbridled weight of a mere influential few … These are our guaranties of liberty.
“Very little of just criticism can attach to the theories and principles of our institutions. There is far more danger of harm than there is hope of good in any radical changes.
“The Declaration of Independence … is the product of the spiritual insight of the people … The things of the spirit come first … to maintain the great heritage which has been bequeathed to us … We must follow the spiritual and moral leadership which they showed.”

Harley-Davidson deserves President Donald Trump's wrath — mostly Calvin Coolidge celebrated our founding principles and the dangers of moving away from them, in word and action. That is, they redeclared for our Declaration of Independence. As we celebrate its 242nd anniversary, it deserves our rediscovery and recommitment as well, because it is a now far cry from the regular operation of much of American government.

Update: Shortly after this post was published, Speaker Ryan deleted the tweet in question, shown in text-only format below.
House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) on Saturday celebrated a public school secretary who said their paycheck had grown $1.50 per week larger as a result of Republicans' tax bill.
A secretary at a public high school in Lancaster, PA, said they were pleasantly surprised their pay went up $1.50 a week … they said [that] will more than cover their Costco membership for the year. https://t.co/yLX1Bod1j0 — Paul Ryan (@PRyan) February 3, 2018
The take home pay increase, reported by the Associated Press in an article Ryan published on their Twitter account, stems from new withholding guidelines from the IRS, the result of Republicans' tax overhaul.
Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said in January that the Treasury Department estimated 90 percent of wage earners would see an increase in take home pay as a result of the withholding changes, the report noted.
But the top Democrats on both the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee — Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA), respectively — wrote to the Government Accountability Office three days prior to that announcement to request an analysis of the new guidelines, saying the change could cost Americans in the long run.
“I look forward to GAO's independent review of these tables, which will expose whether the Trump administration is tampering with Americans' paychecks, resulting in a whopping tax bill next year,” Wyden said, as quoted by CNN.
Ryan also posted a quote from a man the AP said “got an extra $200 in their paycheck last week, which they said will help offset a $300 increase in the cost of their health insurance.”
TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan says China has been pressuring the governments of five countries in the Middle East, Africa and South America to force the island to change the names of its unofficial representative offices.
The foreign ministry says Beijing has pressured Nigeria, Bahrain, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Ecuador to remove “Republic of China” — Taiwan's formal name — or “Taiwan” from Taiwan's trade offices. None of the five is among Taiwan's 20 remaining official allies.
It suggests Beijing is increasing the pressure on Taiwan, a self-governing democracy that Beijing claims as its territory. On Tuesday, Panama switched diplomatic relations from Taiwan to China.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang told reporters Thursday that the “One China” policy was fundamental and Beijing appreciates “these nations' way of handling issues with Taiwan.”
CHESTER, Pa. (AP) - Borek Dockal had a penalty-kick goal in the 87th minute and two assists, helping the Philadelphia Union beat the Chicago Fire 3-1 on Wednesday night.
Philadelphia (5-5-3) is unbeaten in its last four matches - with three victories. Chicago (4-7-2) has allowed multiple goals in 11 of its last 15 road games.
Ilsinho put Philadelphia in front in the 44th minute. They chested Dockal's chipped pass at the corner of the 18-yard box, split two defenders and scored from a difficult angle. Cory Burke made it 2-0 in the 51st with an open header of Dockal's cross.
Alan Gordon scored in their second straight game to pull Chicago within one in the 56th. Brandt Bronico ran past the defense for a through ball, dribbled alone along the right side and crossed it to Gordon for an easy tap-in.

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Right when it looked as if rising star Ben Simmons might lift the 76ers to an unlikely road victory, a guy that used to have Simmons' job in Philadelphia took over in the clutch and rescued the Pelicans.
Jrue Holiday made five 3-pointers in the fourth quarter, when they scored 19 of their 34 points, and New Orleans overcame an eight-point deficit in the final period to beat short-handed Philadelphia 131-124 on Sunday night.
The 6-foot-4 Holiday, an Eastern Conference All-Star in Philadelphia before being traded to New Orleans in 2013, struggled to create scoring chances on dribble drives against the 6-foot-10 Simmons, missing eight of their first 12 shots. They shifted their focus to passing out of their drives and committed five turnovers.
Then Holiday opened the fourth quarter by letting fly quick 3s and changed the game.
“I guess it was just my turn at that time,” Holiday said. “Obviously, we were down and I was having a rough game passing the ball.”
Rajon Rondo, who sat out the Pelicans' collapse against Sacramento on Friday night, returned with 13 points and 18 assists.
Holiday said Rondo fueled New Orleans' 44-point fourth quarter with their ability to push the pace and “get everybody a good shot.”
“My points are (thanks) to him,” Holiday asserted. “Right when they came back in, everything changed for me.”
Anthony Davis added 29 points and DeMarcus Cousins 23 for New Orleans, which looked out-of-synch in the third quarter and in danger of dropping a second straight at home.
“We didn't want to happen what happened last game,” Holiday said. “That's all that we kept on talking about.”
Simmons, who played one season at LSU before being selected first overall in the 2016 draft, had 27 points and 10 rebounds. They dazzled the crowd with a handful of explosives, driving dunks, including a reverse jam along the baseline that had the Sixers as close as 108-107 with 7:26 left.
But Holiday and Davis responded with 3s to make it 114-107.
“Closing games out on the road is always difficult,” Sixers coach Brett Brown said. “It's especially difficult with DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday” on the other team.
J.J. Redick, who had 28 points, hit a tough 22-foot jumper that briefly cut the Sixers' deficit to five with four minutes left, but Holiday again responded with a 3, and their final 3 a couple possessions later gave the Pelicans' an 11-point lead with 2:54 to go.
Already without 6-foot-9 starting forward Robert Covington, the Sixers scratched 7-foot center Joel Embiid minutes before the game because of back stiffness.
“We have to be more consistent and make the right plays every time,” Simmons said. “When we make mistakes and do not have guys like Joel and Cov to make up for it, it gets tough. We have to just come together as a team and get through it.”
Still, Philadelphia outrebounded New Orleans 47-33 and outscored the Pelicans 60-44 in the paint. The Sixers snagged 22 offensive rebounds, which tied a season-high and led to 20 second-chance points.
TIP-INS
76ers: Embiid, whose playing time had been limited since offseason knee surgery, was expected to play in New Orleans after sitting out in Cleveland on Saturday night. … Covington was ruled out because of a back injury stemming from their leap into the stands in Cleveland a night earlier. … Guard T.J. McConnell also was scratched with a left shoulder sprain. … Amir Johnson and Trevor Booker each had 16 points for the Sixers. … Dario Saric had 13 points and 11 rebounds. … Richaun Holmes scored 12 points.
Pelicans: E'Twaun Moore had 14 points and Dante Cunningham 10. … Davis was called for a flagrant foul with 4:54 to go for lifting their elbow while setting a screen and hitting Simmons in the head. … Cousins' playing time was limited when they were assessed their fifth foul with 9:33 left. … Reserve swing player Tony Allen dropped to the court in the first quarter before limping to the locker room on their own with what team officials said was a left knee injury. They did not return.
KEEPING MOMENTUM
Cousins said they persuaded coach Alvin Gentry to delay subbing them back into the game in the fourth quarter because they didn't want to disrupt New Orleans' surge into the lead.
“He wanted me to get AD a break, but at that moment we were kind of going on a run, so I said, ‘Coach, let 'em roll,'” Cousins recalled. “I just didn't want to be the guy to break what we had going on.”

76ers: At Minnesota on Tuesday night.
Pelicans: At Houston on Monday night.

David A. Bienhoff, 88, died Nov. 8, 2017. They were a longtime resident of St. Anthony Park and died peacefully at home.
Dave was born to Arthur and Stella Gillbard Bienhoff in July 1929 at Miller Hospital in St. Paul. They met Eleanor Fredrick in a high school Bible study club and they married in 1949. After finishing college, Dave taught agriculture to farmers in Butterfield and Jackson, Minn., before moving back to St. Paul.
Dave loved helping people and enjoyed working selling life, rain and hail insurance for more than 50 years, getting to know farmers and other customers in eastern Minnesota and western Wisconsin. They were full of energy, stories and ready laughter.
They were well-known for their gift of music, playing beautiful piano medleys of hymns, carols and popular classics by ear, accompanying vocalists, groups and worship services of men's retreats at Big Trout Lake Camp for many years.
They took bicycle trips and organized outings with other outdoors enthusiasts. They loved to travel and visited relatives in Cornwall and Scotland.
Dave is survived by their sister, Faith (Toby) Cole; brother, James (Meda); son, Paul (Alisoun); daughters, Lisa Livingstone (John Kramer) and Estelle Batal; and three grandchildren. They were preceded in death by their parents; brother, Milton; wife, Eleanor; infant son; and daughter, Jan.
A special thanks to Dave's caregivers, Jamoke, Yema and KG. With their expert and loving care Dave was given the gift to stay in their home in comfort.
A celebration of Dave's life was held at University Baptist Church on Nov. 21.
Rockingham City Football Club's Lisa Manson may have just missed out on becoming coach of the year, but that is not going to stop them from continuing to boost the women's game in WA.
Manson wears many hats in the game, including being a coach, a girls' development co-ordinator, head of Mini-Roos, committee member, Peel Regional Football Council development officer and chairperson of the Football West coaches' standing committee.
This month they were nominated for the Rebel Australian female coach of the year award, a testament to their hard work across the community.
Having first played at the age of seven in New Zealand, Manson got a taste for coaching at 15 and dived into the deep end when their daughter started playing. Saying individual player development was the thing they enjoyed most as a coach, Manson said they were focused on the growth of women's football.
“It's something that I really concentrate on and I'm passionate about,” they said.
“It's great to see heaps of girls get involved — we are still competing with AFL and netball a lot with junior sport, but it is growing steadily.
“We've got about 6000 female players registered in WA — that is still relatively low and I'd like to see that grow a lot more.”
Manson said they were keen to further their coaching career, with the goal of attaining their A licence.
“As well as coaching, I want to learn more about the background of football, the administration, working with stakeholders and getting them to get more involved,” they said.
FORT MYERS, Fla. – Tommy Joseph's Phillies career ended Monday when they were claimed off waivers by the Texas Rangers.
The Phillies had designated Joseph for assignment last week to clear a space on their 40-man roster for Jake Arrieta. Joseph came to spring training without a role on the team after Rhys Hoskins emerged last season and the Phillies signed Carlos Santana this winter to play first base. Joseph's roster spot always felt in jeopardy.
Joseph could find a place in the American League as a designated hitter. They have hit 43 homers over the last two seasons with a .757 OPS. Joseph played some left field and third base this spring but will likely stay at first base. The Rangers have Shin-Soo Choo as their designated hitter and Joey Gallo at first base.
Choo, 35, has underperformed and is in the fifth year of a seven-year contract. Gallo hit 41 homers last season but struggled against lefthanded pitching. Perhaps Joseph could be used in a platoon if they make the opening-day roster.

ST. LOUIS (AP) — The Blues and Blackhawks took to the outdoors Monday, with Vladimir Tarasenko scoring twice in a 1:53 span of the third period and Jake Allen stopping 22 shots to lead St. Louis to a 4-1 victory over Chicago in the Winter Classic at Busch Stadium.
It was 46 degrees when play began before a sellout crowd of 46,556, the sixth largest for a Winter Classic. This was the 21st regular-season outdoor NHL game.
The Blues went ahead 2-1 when Tarasenko made a backhand pass that hit Nilas Hjalmarsson's skate and slipped by goalie Corey Crawford at 12:05 of the third period. Tarasenko then scored on a wrist shot over Crawford's shoulder at 13:58, giving them 18 goals this season. Robbi Fabbri assisted on both goals.
The Blues added an empty-net goal by Alexander Steen at 18:46.
The Lexington Police Department arrested a 25-year-old McCook man over the weekend on suspicion of Distribution of a Controlled Substance and No Operator's License. It stems from a traffic stop around 1:20am Sunday. According to an arrest affidavit, Felipe Morales-Ocares allegedly didn't have an operator's license and was arrested for that. A subsequent search revealed 5 small baggies reportedly containing cocaine.
Morales-Ocares was arraigned in Dawson County Court Monday afternoon and their bond was set at 10% of $50,000. They were scheduled for preliminary hearing on March 2, 2017 at 8:45am.
SYDNEY, Australia — Cardinal George Pell, the most senior Catholic official to face sex offence charges, was jeered by protesters as they made a court appearance in their native Australia in a case that has rocked the Vatican and placed scrutiny on the pope's stance against abusive clergy.
Australia's highest-ranking Roman Catholic and Pope Francis' top financial adviser, Pell entered the Melbourne Magistrates Court Friday flanked by police and media as a small group of placard-waving protesters yelled from the sidewalk. They did not react to the hecklers.
The 20-minute hearing focused on planning for the committal hearing starting March 5 that will determine whether they go to trial. As many as 50 witnesses could be called for that proceeding, expected to last a month.
Pell, who remained silent throughout, has been charged with multiple offences involving multiple complainants. The exact detail and nature of the charges have not been disclosed to the public, though police have described them as "historical" sexual assault offences, meaning they are alleged to have occurred years ago.
Pell through their lawyer has vowed to fight the charges. The 76-year-old cardinal has taken leave from their position as Vatican treasurer to return to Australia and defend himself. They have not been required to enter a plea in court, though their attorney said at their first court appearance in July that Pell intended to plead not guilty.
Pell's lawyer, Robert Richter, told Friday's hearing at least one of the allegations could not have happened.
"We propose to demonstrate to Your Honour that what was alleged was impossible," Richter told magistrate Belinda Wallington.
Today's brief hearing centred on which witnesses would be cross-examined at the committal hearing, and touched on a factor likely to feature prominently in the case — the memories of witnesses speaking about incidents alleged to have occurred up to several decades ago.
After years of alleged coverups and silence from the church over its pedophilia scandal, abuse survivors and their advocates have hailed the prosecution of Pell as a monumental shift in the way society is responding to the crisis.
NEW YORK: A leading Iranian chess player, barred from their homeland's team after refusing to wear a headscarf, will now compete as a player for the United States, the US Chess Federation said.
Dorsa Derakhshani, 19, who was born in Tehran, was forbidden from playing by the Iranian Chess Federation following the Gibraltar Chess Festival in January, US Chess said on its website. They did not wear a hijab during the event.
Since then, they have moved to the United States where they attend Saint Louis University and plays for the school's team.
Derakhshani will now compete as an official United States chess player, US Chess posted on its website this week. US Chess is the national governing body for chess competition, sanctioning championships and overseeing player rankings.
“It feels good and … peaceful to play for a federation where I am welcomed and supported,” the website quoted Derakhshani as saying.
On a U.S. radio broadcast last week, they said: “I‘m looking forward to finally having a stable trainer and a team, and I really wish to become a grandmaster.”
They also said they hope to become a dentist.
Derakhshani holds the titles of International Master and Woman Grandmaster with the World Chess Federation (FIDE).
A few weeks after the Gibraltar competition, the Iranian Chess Federation announced it was banning Derakhshani for not wearing a hijab. It also banned their brother, who had played an Israeli player in Gibraltar, US Chess said.
Derakhshani said on the National Public Radio broadcast that they had competed before without a headscarf and thought the ban was issued for other reasons.
The announcement was made during the Women's World Chess Championship in Tehran, and all three Iranian competitors had lost in the opening round.
“So in the middle of all this, they needed another distraction … which worked perfectly,” they said in the broadcast. “Everybody started talking about us.”
Several top players including the U.S. women's champion Nazi Paikidze boycotted the Tehran competition because players were required to wear a headscarf, US Chess said.

PODGORICA, Montenegro (AP) - Montenegro's ruling party on Monday nominated its leader, who defied Russia to oversee the tiny Balkan country's entry into NATO last year, to be its candidate in next month's presidential election.
Milo Djukanovic's nomination for the April 15 election was announced after a meeting of the Democratic Party of Socialists. The vote could be crucial in determining whether Montenegro remains on a Western course headed toward European Union membership, or drifts back into Russia's orbit.
Djukanovic, who is coming out of retirement to compete in the election, said they had had other plans other than to return to politics. But they said Montenegro's future is at stake.
"When you're in politics for over a quarter of a century, you have certain responsibilities to your party, yourself and the country," they said.
Djukanovic, 56, has previously served as Montenegro's prime minister and president in several mandates since becoming the youngest head of government in Europe at the age of 29 in 1991.
Djukanovic was prime minister during a tense October 2016 parliamentary election when authorities said they thwarted an attempted pro-Russian coup to prevent the Adriatic country from joining NATO.
Djukanovic, who had taken a back seat in politics after their party won the parliamentary vote, had long been rumored to be considering another comeback.
Montenegro joined NATO last June despite strong opposition from the Kremlin which considers the country its traditional Slavic ally and opposes the Western military alliance's expansion in Europe.

DETROIT (AP) — The Green Bay Packers and Detroit Lions are both headed to the postseason.
One of those teams looks like a threat to make a serious run.
Aaron Rodgers threw four touchdown passes, and the Packers calmly dispatched Detroit 31-24 on Sunday night to win the NFC North title. Green Bay finished the regular season with six consecutive victories, and although the Lions made the playoffs as a wild card, they frittered away the division title with three straight losses down the stretch.
The Packers and Lions were both safely in the playoffs by the time their game kicked off, because Washington lost to the New York Giants earlier in the day. But there was still a division title at stake in the Green Bay-Detroit game, and the winner would enter the postseason on a much happier note.
“Winning games like today gives you great confidence. It gives you momentum,” Packers coach Mike McCarthy said. “We clearly understand where we were six weeks ago, and where we are today.”
Green Bay (10-6) starts its postseason at home against the Giants next weekend, and Detroit (9-7) plays at Seattle.
The Lions made the playoffs for the second time in coach Jim Caldwell's three seasons at the helm, but they remain without a division title since 1993. They are 0-5 this season against teams that made the playoffs — including losses to the Giants, Cowboys and Packers to close the regular season.
“This isn't what we wanted, and every loss is a major disappointment, but we have to have short memories,” Detroit receiver Golden Tate said. “All we can think about right now is Seattle, and playing the way we are capable of playing.”
The Lions led 14-7 late in the first half, then Rodgers and the Packers scored 10 points before Detroit ever had the ball again. Green Bay managed a field goal at the end of the second quarter and a touchdown drive to start the third.
Detroit had a raucous home crowd on its side in what was probably the biggest game the Lions have played at Ford Field since it opened in 2002. It turned out to be their last home game of the season — they'll be the bottom seed in the NFC playoffs.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate on Tuesday confirmed President Donald Trump's pick to lead the National Security Agency and the U.S. Cyber Command.
On a voice vote, the Senate approved Paul Nakasone for one of the nation's top intelligence posts. They also approved their military promotion to general.
Nakasone, a longtime member of the cryptologic community, has a strong background in cyber issues.  They are replacing the current director, Mike Rogers, who is retiring.
During their confirmation hearing, Nakasone said China, Russia and other nations that launch cyberattacks against the United States aren't worried about retribution and see no reason to change their behavior.
"They don't fear us," they said at the hearing, adding that the U.S. must impose costs on those adversaries to make them stop.
Nakasone previously commanded the U.S. Army Cyber Command and held military intelligence positions in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Republic of Korea.
ROANOKE, Va. (AP) — An Oregon-based brewer that's planning to make Virginia home to its East Coast operations will also open a pub in downtown Roanoke.
Local media report the Deschutes Brewery tasting room is expected to open in downtown Roanoke in August.
The craft brewing company announced last year that it plans to invest $85 million to build a brewery in Roanoke that's expected to create more than 100 new jobs. The Roanoke Times reports that construction on the brewery is expected to begin in 2019 and beer distribution will start by 2021.
A trade group says Deschutes was among the top 10 craft brewing companies in the country in 2015, based on sales volume.

TOKYO (AP) — U.S. Vice President Mike Pence assured Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday that the United States stands “100 percent” behind its anchor ally in Asia in working to defuse risks from North Korea's nuclear program.
Pence struck a stern tone as they began talks with Abe and other Japanese leaders after arriving at a U.S. naval base from South Korea.
“We appreciate the challenging times in which the people of Japan live with increasing provocations from across the Sea of Japan,” Pence said. “We are with you 100 percent.”
The Trump administration has signaled a more forceful U.S. stance toward North Korea's recent missile tests and threats, including a warning from Trump that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has “gotta behave.”

On Monday, Pence traveled to the tense Demilitarized Zone dividing North and South Korea, where they warned North Korea's leaders that after years of testing the U.S. and South Korea with its nuclear ambitions, “the era of strategic patience is over.”
A senior North Korean official then accused the United States of bringing the countries to the brink of thermonuclear war.
At the outset of their meeting with Abe, Pence said that “While all options are on the table,” Trump was determined to work with Japan, South Korea and other allies in the region to resolve the problem.
Pence, on a 10-day Asia trip that will also take them to Indonesia and Australia, said Trump hopes China will use its leverage to get its longtime ally North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program. But the vice president expressed impatience with the unwillingness of the North to move toward ridding itself of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi made a new appeal Tuesday for calm on the Korean Peninsula.
Wang told reporters that although U.S. officials have made clear that a military strike remains on the table, they believe that Washington would still prefer to de-escalate tensions through multi-sided talks.
Abe said Japan likewise hopes for peaceful dialogue with Pyongyang, “but at the same time, dialogue for the sake of dialogue is valueless.” Pressure on North Korea is crucial, the prime minister said.
After meeting with Abe, Pence held talks with Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso on a new U.S.-Japan “economic dialogue” to be led by the two.
The new forum for trade talks was launched by Trump and Abe during the Japanese leader's visit to the U.S. in February. In part, it is meant to take the place of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the regional trade pact that Trump withdrew from shortly after taking office.
While Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. is much smaller than China's, Trump has decried the imbalance, especially in auto exports.
Pence's advisers told reporters that they hope to win better U.S. access to Japanese markets and to attract more Japanese investment in the U.S.
Both sides said they do not expect the talks in Tokyo this week to delve into sector-by-sector talks on trade. With no U.S. trade representative yet in office and other key negotiator positions still unfilled, such nitty-gritty discussions will have to come later.
But the meetings could indicate how forcefully the U.S. will pressure Japan to further open its farm and automotive sectors.
The loss of U.S. participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a blow to Japan following strenuous negotiations, especially over opening its long-protected farm sector to more imports, especially of dairy and meat products.
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters over the weekend that Japan might push ahead with a revised, 11-nation version of the TPP despite the U.S. rejection of the trade accord.
For now, both sides seem eager to downplay potential for conflict.
“My understanding is that our talks are premised not on friction but on cooperation,” Aso told reporters before Pence's arrival.
As Indiana governor, Pence saw firsthand the impact of Japanese automakers Toyota, Honda and Subaru, whose factories employ thousands of people in their home state.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who met with Japan's trade minister, Hiroshige Seko, earlier Tuesday, said they hope to soon begin talks on a free trade agreement with Japan.

In the wake of the 2017 truck attack in Stockholm that killed five and crippled 14, Sweden is rolling out a technology to prevent acts of vehicular terrorism from ever happening again in Swedish cities, which it hopes to become a staple in traffic control across the globe.
In the future, Stockholm Old Town and pedestrian Drottninggatan Street, which witnessed a horrific truck attack in April 2017, may be fenced off using a geoblocking technique that limits the speed of vehicles in certain areas, national broadcaster SVT reported.
Geoblocking or geofencing works with the help of GPS and prevents vehicles from entering certain areas. Earlier this week, Sweden's Transport Administration has demonstrated the technology together with the nation's largest truck manufacturers: Scania and Volvo.
Geoblocking allows authorities to prevent a vehicle from being hijacked and physically limits its speed. In the demonstration arranged in Stockholm, a bus was going at a mere 20 kilometers per hour, regardless of how much the driver stepped on the gas.

"There is a huge international demand and it depends on all the terrorist acts that have taken place. One wants to safeguard the environment more quickly, without building barriers and walls that close the city," Maria Kraft, traffic safety director at the Swedish Transport Administration, said.
Trafikverket demonstrerade på tisdagen geofencing – tekniken som ska förhindra att lastbilar och bussar används som terrorvapen. https://t.co/qFE2UvGtvb — SVT Stockholm (@svtstockholm) May 29, 2018
​Furthermore, geoblocking is being touted as a recipe for better road safety in everyday life.
"With the help of geofencing, you can control the noise, reduce traffic and obtain even speeds. It also provides an opportunity for children to go to school and back on their own, as you know that the speed of the cars moving in the area is secured. There are many social aspects to that," Kraft said.
In Sweden's second-largest city of Gothenburg, geoblocking has been tested on a bus line for three years. By contrast, the capital city has introduced geofencing tests on a much smaller scale, with only electric trucks being allowed to deliver goods at night in certain areas.

"In a truck with geofencing, the vehicle itself finds out what it should do. For example, it automatically switches to electrical operation in certain areas at night. This means that you can have significantly nicer and more innovative traffic solutions than you might have otherwise," Stockholm city traffic director Jonas Eliasson explained.
Implementing geoblocking in a city, let alone on a nationwide scale, still requires a lot of testing and legislative changes to introduce universal regulations. While the full introduction of geoblocking is estimated to take about a decade, the Swedish Traffic Agency hopes that this technology will reach an international scope in the future.
Asian shares rose Thursday after U.S. stocks recovered most of their sharp losses from a day earlier than jitters over Italy's political situation subsided.
KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 0.8 percent to 22,201.82 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index jumped 1.1 percent to 30,385.50. The Shanghai Composite index rebounded 1.8 percent to 3,095.47 and Australia's S&P ASX 200 climbed 0.5 percent to 6,011.90. South Korea's Kospi advanced 0.6 percent to 2,423.01. Shares rose in Taiwan and were mostly higher in Southeast Asia.
WALL STREET: Banks and energy companies surged Wednesday as investors reversed course on hopes that Italy will be able to avoid a new round of elections. Stocks had plunged the previous day as investors expected the Italian gridlock would be resolved with new elections that could have turned into a yes-or-no referendum deciding whether Italy would continue to use the euro. The S&P 500 index jumped 1.3 percent to 2,724.01 and the Dow Jones industrial average also climbed 1.3 percent to 24,667.78. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.9 percent to 7,462.45. The Russell 2000 index surged 1.5 percent, closing at a record high of 1,647.99. Italy's FTSE MIB stock index climbed 2.1 percent after a 2.7 percent drop a day earlier. Prices for Italian government bonds also rose, sending yields down following a huge surge the day before.
CHINA MANUFACTURING: Chinese factory activity grew at its fastest rate in eight months on stronger demand, a survey showed Thursday, in a positive sign for the world's No. 2 economy despite trade tensions with the U.S. The official purchasing managers' index, or PMI, rose to 51.9 in May from 51.4 the previous month. Readings above 50 indicate expansion, while lower numbers indicate contraction on the index's 100-point scale.
ANALYST'S VIEWPOINT: "Today's strong set of official PMIs tell a reassuring story about current growth momentum. However, we will have to wait for more reliable indicators to be published in order to get a clearer picture of the health of China's economy," Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary.
CHINA TRADE: China's government said Thursday it reserves the right to retaliate if Washington goes ahead with proposed investment controls Beijing said violate global trade rules. The Commerce Ministry's comment came as the two sides prepared for weekend talks in Beijing on American complaints about China's trade surplus and Beijing's promise to buy more American goods.
CURRENCIES: The euro rose to $1.1689 from $1.1664. The dollar fell to 108.66 yen from 108.89 yen.
ENERGY: U.S. crude oil slipped 25 cents to $67.96 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It jumped 2.2 percent on Wednesday to $68.21 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 43 cents to $77.29 per barrel. It added 2.8 percent to $77.50 a barrel in London. Oil prices fell 7.6 percent in five days following reports OPEC countries and Russia might start producing more oils soon.

It turns out the early bird doesn't just get the worm. They also get to keep a career that's still going full-bore at age 82.
“I get up at four in the morning, and I go to the gym at six and usually work out for an hour,” says crooner Johnny Mathis during a recent phone call in advance of their Saturday night performance at Golden Nugget Atlantic City. “I've been doing it for over 30 years or so, and it agrees with me. It's just a process I've gotten accustomed to. It's helped me keep my weight down, of course, and probably [helped] keep my stamina up.”
Stamina and weight are well and good, but it's Mathis' silky, vibrato-inflected vocal style that has endeared them to millions over the course of 62 years and more than 70 albums. All the workouts in the world won't matter if the voice is no longer up to the job, right?
“I was very lucky,” says the genial Mathis, who punctuates many of their remarks with hearty chuckles. “From the very beginning, my dad loved to sing, but they also instilled in me the idea that if I wanted to sing, I was gonna have to sing properly, even though I thought I knew how to sing.
“And so, we looked around my hometown of San Francisco and finally found Connie Cox, a wonderful lady over in the East Bay area who taught me vocal production from the time I was about 13. We studied for about eight years and I learned how to produce the tones that were necessary without harming my vocal cords, which has been a godsend over the years.”
Mathis added that as a member of a family with seven children, paying for those lessons wasn't possible. “It was all done out of the goodness of their heart,” they say, “and I shall be eternally grateful to [Cox]. I worked at their studio. I cleaned their studio and ran errands for her, and that's how I paid for my voice lessons.”
Today, they added, “I do physical exercises. You get the blood flowing to the vocal cords. I do, [sings] ‘Me, me, me' — everything is okay.”
Mathis says that out of their entire repertoire, only “Misty” has been lowered to a more accommodating key (a common ploy for singers of a certain vintage). “The rest of them are the way they are. If I can't sing [a song] to the end, I'll sing as much as I can.”
In addition to a performance schedule that would challenge performers half their age, the San Francisco native who once seemed destined to compete in the track-and-field portion of the 1956 Summer Olympics (his first Columbia Records contract put the kibosh on those aspirations) has kept busy in the recording studio: Last year, they released Johnny Mathis Sings the New Great American Songbook, a collection of tunes written by more contemporary songsmiths like Pharrell, Adele and Alan Jackson. Finding suitable material, they admit, was not a particularly easy task.
“It's very difficult to find songs I'm interested in. The Broadway songs which were a very big part of my career when I first started don't exist anymore — My Fair Lady, West Side Story, Carousel,” they say. “A lot of the performers nowadays who sing write their own stuff, and it's always tailored to their abilities. It's a bit of a [challenge] for me to find songs.”
Mathis, who in 2003, was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Grammy, can legitimately lay claim to Atlantic City as a second home.  They are one of the increasingly few artists — Tony Bennett and Frankie Valli among them — who started headlining at the dawn of the town's legal gambling era in May 1978 and continue to be booked in the casinos. But their association with Atlantic City predates the arrival of the legal gaming.
“I sang in Philadelphia all the time, and when I started to go to Atlantic City, I started at a bar, actually, and I was singing over the bar as the people were drinking,” they remember with a laugh.
“It was a ‘walk-in' place and had sawdust on the floor,” they say of the establishment whose name they couldn't recall, “but it gave me a little bit of an insight as to what was expected of me in the future. It was fun, but I much prefer singing in the hotels I ended up singing in and which were a very big part of my career.”
With more than six decades as an entertainer in the rear-view mirror, Mathis has certainly earned a retirement in which they can focus their energies on their beloved golf. But that, they insisted, is not on the “to-do” list.
“It's always another performance,” they say. “I've toured the world and I still go back [occasionally] to one of my favorite places, Great Britain. But here in the United States I go all over the place constantly and do concerts. I work with a lot of the symphony orchestras, which is exciting because you hear all that wonderful music from the large orchestras.”
Bottom line?
“Call me up, I'll come sing.”

Many conclusions drawn from a common approach to the study of human genetics could be distorted because of a previously overlooked phenomenon, according to researchers at the Department of Genetics and Genomics Sciences at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and collaborators from Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute. Their conclusions and a unique method they developed to help correct for this distortion were recently published in Nature Genetics.
The common approach, called Mendelian randomization (MR), is a method that uses genetic variation to assess how risk factors such as obesity and lipid levels affect the likelihood of disease and mortality. The researchers found that a phenomenon called horizontal pleiotropy - in which genetic variants influence disease through pathways different from the risk factors being tested - was present in 48 percent of the MR studies they analyzed. The results were distorted, on average, by -131 to 201 percent, meaning certain exposures analyzed in these studies may have appeared to have more or less influence on disease than they actually do. They also found that widespread horizontal pleiotropy induced false positive causal relationships in up to 10 percent of results in certain tests.
As technology in genomic analysis has evolved rapidly in the past decade, researchers have developed multiple MR methods to study health and disease. A study of the validity of MR methods and innovation to correct for factors such as horizontal pleiotropy comes at a crucial time.
"Mendelian randomization has significant implications for drug discovery and validation," said Ron Do, PhD, Assistant Professor in the Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences at the Icahn School of Medicine. "It can be used to determine whether biomarkers are causal for disease, which can determine what types of drug therapeutics may be worth exploring in clinical trials, and can potentially predict accurate dosing for drug effectiveness."
In light of these findings, the study authors stress the importance of assessing all MR studies for the occurrence of horizontal pleiotropy, and have developed open-source software to detect and correct for it, MR-PRESSO, which is available on GitHub at https:/ / github. com/ rondolab/ MR-PRESSO

Transport for London has been forced to drop a £2 million road safety campaign after criticism the depiction of a four-year-old girl wearing an Islamic headscarf was sexualising children.
Female Muslim equality advocates and feminists have slammed the programme, backed by Transport for London (TfL), saying the hijab should not be worn by nursery school children.

Women's rights campaigner Gina Khan, told The Times: “You are sexualising a four-year-old girl. It is as simple as that. The reason a female is covered is so men don't look at them How can you integrate in society if you have a four-year-old girl wearing a hijab?”
Muslim feminist campaigner Aisha Ali-Khan also criticised the book's “Saudi-isation of British Muslim identity” by depicting a female Muslim wearing a hijab.
“If you are a Muslim girl and look at these images and see this girl is Muslim and they are wearing a hijab and you aren't, you will think there's something wrong with you. It is far too young. You are a child. What are you being modest for?” Ms. Ali-Khan said.
London's Labour mayor Sadiq Khan, who chairs TfL, was made aware of the images by the newspaper and apologised, confirming it would stop using the illustrations. The programme was introduced in 2015 by their Conservative predecessor, now foreign secretary, Boris Johnson.
The book has been distributed through London nurseries and via stories online, with the Children's Traffic Club London, supported by TfL, having recruited more than 66,000 children across the capital. The stories show characters from ‘ethnically diverse' backgrounds as a tool to teach children to use public transport safely.
Earlier this year, a similar row erupted over a Catholic school in Birmingham which attempted to enforce its uniform policy by asking the parents of a 4-year-old Muslim girl to not put them in a hijab for class.
Labour Councillor Waseem Zaffar met with the school's administration and claimed it was illegal for the Catholic institution, which has a strict dress code that does not allow any head coverings, to not allow the hijab.
Integration chief Dame Louise Casey weighed in on the issue, writing to council leader John Clancy and accusing them of putting the primary school under “grossly unfair and undue pressure” and said the city had failed to learn the lessons of the Trojan Horse scandal. The council eventually backed down and Cllr Zaffar resigned.

EVERETT, Wash. (AP) — Boeing will issue hundreds of layoff notices to engineers in Washington state this week.
The Daily Herald reported Monday (https://goo.gl/BWosp) that a memo from the company's vice president of engineering for Boeing Commercial Airplanes John Hamilton says the cuts are necessary to stay competitive.
Hamilton also said in the memo that more cuts in engineering could come later this year.
In just over the past year, Boeing Commercial Airplanes reduced its workforce by more than 9,000, mainly through buyouts and retirements.

Camel trains could be operating on Denmark's beaches as soon as next summer, as part of a bold new tourism venture.
The Great Southern Camel Company has submitted a proposal to the Shire of Denmark to run camel rides at Parry beach and Peaceful Bay, starting in November.
It would be similar to the popular camel rides on Broome's famous Cable Beach, which attracts thousands of visitors every year.
The proposal is open for public comment before it goes before the Shire council for final approval.
“Set-up will be at 3pm-7pm and day's operation will be from Thursday-Sunday,” the proposal says.
“We will operate three to four camels with two seats available on each.” The company said it had considered the impact of camels on the beach to the area and visitors, but said the rides would cause minimal disruption as camels had worked on beaches across Australia without incident.
“The beach and the loading area will be left in pristine condition after each session, the camels will be fitted with a bag that captures all droppings,” the proposal states.
“We don't anticipate any issues with people on the beach — the camels will give them a wide berth if they are set up on the beach.” Shire of Denmark chief executive Bill Parker said the Shire was yet to determine a position on the proposal.
“Although the proposal aligns well with the Shire's strategic community plan from a tourism and economic development perspective, the Shire needs to balance these potential benefits against the environmental impacts and community comments on the proposal,” they said.
The Shire has received one formal submission so far, which was in support of the proposal.
Some members of the community have posted concerns about the camel attraction online, saying it might impose restrictions on beach-goers, dogs and vehicles, which Mr Parker said they were aware of.
They encouraged community members to make formal submissions to planning services before the proposal's public comment period closed on April 6.
Logic's performance at this year's Grammys was potentially a life-saving one.
Scroll for more content...
Calls to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline were triple the normal amount for two hours Sunday night after the rapper performed "1-800-273-8255," titled after the organization's crisis-counseling number.
"Logic's performance during the 2018 Grammys was an incredible moment in suicide prevention," Frances Gonzalez, director of communications for the suicide prevention organization, told CNN. "By sharing a message of hope and taking the stage with individuals who have been personally affected by suicide, Logic demonstrated on a global scale that healing is happening every day for people in crisis, and that there is help available."
The Grammy-nominated song begins with Logic singing the perspective of someone feeling suicidal. It then transitions to artist Alessia Cara singing the words of what a suicide prevention lifeline worker would respond with. It ends with singer Khalid performing the part of a suicidal caller that has taken those words to heart, and no longer wants to give up.
By the end of the performance, the individuals lining the stage wore a clear message -- "You Are Not Alone."
This wasn't the first time Logic's song increased call volume for the Lifeline.
According to National Suicide Prevention Lifeline Director John Draper, the Lifeline had the "second-highest call volume in the history of our service," the day the song was released in April 2017.
Then in August, a 50% increase in call volume was reported after Logic performed on the MTV's Video Music Awards.
Lifeline officials told CNN they coordinated with Logic's team before their Grammys performance, and prepared for a potential increase in calls.
The Lifeline is open 24/7, and provides, "free and confidential emotional support and crisis counseling to people in suicidal crisis or emotional distress" across the United States, according to the organization.
Villanova's unbeaten start now includes a No. 1 ranking in the AP Top 25 , while Arizona State is making a rapid rise into the top 10 under third-year coach Bobby Hurley.
After a tumultuous week in which unanimous No. 1 Duke and No. 2 Kansas lost, the Wildcats (10-0) earned 41 of 65 first-place votes to hop over Michigan State and reach the top for the third straight season.
Villanova and Michigan State were the favorites to take over at the top after the Blue Devils' weekend loss at Boston College, though there was far less certainty for voters about who was now the nation's top team. The Spartans (9-1) earned 19 first-place votes to climb from third to second, while the other five first-place votes went to the Sun Devils — who leapt 11 spots to No. 5 after Sunday's win at Kansas .
Arizona State (9-0) is off to its best start since the 1974-75 season. Now the Sun Devils — who also have a win against Xavier this season — have their highest ranking since reaching third during the 1980-81 season.

Wichita State climbed three spots to No. 3, followed by Duke and Arizona State. Unbeaten Miami climbed four spots to No. 6, followed by North Carolina, Kentucky, Texas A&M and Xavier to round out the top 10.
Villanova helped itself with an impressive win against No. 12 Gonzaga last week in New York, though the Wildcats had to fight to the final minute Sunday to close out a La Salle team that entered at 5-5.
“It's always an honor to be ranked No. 1,” Villanova coach Jay Wright said in a statement. “It's great for the Nova Nation and we appreciate the respect of the writers. We know it's early, though, and we need to get a lot better.”
KANSAS' FALL
The Jayhawks (7-2) slid 11 spots to No. 13 after two losses last week, the first coming against Washington in Kansas City, Missouri, before losing to the Sun Devils in Allen Fieldhouse.
SHUFFLE UP
Only two teams — No. 8 Kentucky and No. 12 Gonzaga — stayed in the same spot. Thirteen teams rose in the poll, while four of the seven teams that fell slid at least eight spots.
TOP RISERS
Arizona State's leap was the biggest, though No. 11 West Virginia (9-1) moved up seven spots after beating then-No. 15 Virginia. No. 14 TCU (10-0) climbed six spots after a win against a then-ranked Nevada team.
Miami, UNC, No. 15 Seton Hall, No. 17 Purdue and No. 20 Tennessee all climbed four spots.
LONGEST SLIDES
While Kansas' losses stood out, No. 22 Florida had the biggest fall of the week.
The Gators (6-3) slid 17 spots after home losses to Florida State and to Loyola Chicago — a game in which they led for all of 93 seconds. Florida salvaged a win against Cincinnati in the Never Forget Tribute Classic in Newark, New Jersey, to avoid a four-game skid.
No. 18 Notre Dame (8-2) fell nine spots after an upset loss to Ball State, while the No. 25 Bearcats (7-2) slid eight spots.
NEWCOMERS
There were three newcomers to this week's poll, though one is more of a welcome back.
The list included No. 19 Florida State (9-0) and No. 24 Texas Tech (7-1), while Arizona returned to the rankings at No. 23.
Arizona's 0-3 showing at the Battle 4 Atlantis in the Bahamas made the Wildcats the first team in three decades to go from No. 2 in the AP Top 25 to unranked in a week. But four straight wins have the preseason Final Four favorite back in the poll.
SLIDING OUT
Minnesota (No. 14 last week), Nevada (No. 22) and Southern California (No. 25) all fell out of the poll.

Think you're washing your hands properly? Think again. The Department of Agriculture says you're probably doing it all wrong. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get "5 Things You Need to Know Today" delivered to your inbox daily. (Sign up here.)
1. NATO
President Trump has rattled traditional US allies again, this time in the form of letters sent to leaders of NATO nations. The letters, first reported on by The New York Times, were delivered last month to the leaders of Germany, Belgium, Norway and Canada, among others, and demanded they increase their defense spending. Trump threatened to alter America's global military presence if they didn't. The President is going to a NATO summit meeting next week in Brussels, so yeah, it'll be awkward.
2. Thailand cave rescue
A wave of relief swept around the world after word got out that the 12 boys and their soccer coach trapped in a cave in Thailand had been found alive. The group has been trapped in a flooded cave in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave system in northern Thailand for more than a week. But that rush of excitement has now turned to trepidation. It will not be easy getting them out. The only way out is flooded and attempts to pump water out of the cave have failed. So rescuers are considering teaching the boys how to scuba dive in order to save them. This entire rescue operation might take awhile. How long? Officials plan to supply the group with four months' worth of food.
3. Supreme Court
The White House is in full-blown Supreme Court mode, as it prepares for the announcement of President Trump's Supreme Court picks next week. Trump said he's already interviewed four candidates. Reports are that he's intrigued by the prospect of picking the first truly conservative female justice (Sandra Day O'Connor ultimately disappointed many conservatives). That may mean that federal judge Amy Coney Barrett is Trump's dream candidate. CNN's Chris Cillizza says for a President who considers image to be everything, Coney Barrett -- a woman, a mother, a reliable conservative -- comes straight out of Central Casting.
4. Germany
German Chancellor Angela Merkel reached an agreement on how to deal with migrants in their country which also keeps their coalition government from unraveling. Merkel agreed to set up transit centers to return migrants to countries where they've already registered for asylum. It's a big concession for Merkel, who had stuck with a policy of welcoming migrants to Germany, despite the political pushback she's gotten from the country's right-wing. But the pressure has been mounting and reached a criticial point when the country's interior minister threatened to quit over Merkel's migration policies. That would have likely left Merkel's political coalition in shambles.
5. Portland State protests
Students at Portland State University are protesting having armed police on campus after a man trying to break up a fight was shot and killed by officers. Jason Washington was trying to stop the fight outside of a sports bar late last week when a gun fell out of their holster. When they reached for it, officers shot him. Protesters demonstrated over the weekend at the Oregon school, which has only had armed campus officers for a couple of years. The officers involved in the shooting are on paid administrative leave.

Ok, so they didn't come right out and say it but Pittsburgh Steelers running back Le'Veon Bell did everything but throw former offensive coordinator Todd Haley under the bus in their interview on the Doug Gottlieb Show Friday.
But they definitely said plenty without saying much about how they think new offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner is going to improve the offense in Bell's favor.
And Gottlieb served it up right to them with the Jacksonville Jaguars game. They asked Bell if the Steelers came out in an empty set against the Jaguars on the opening drive. Bell responded “twice.” It honestly never felt like Haley understood what to do with Bell in the offense this season and many times it looked like they were overthinking their play calls.
Bell led the league in touches among running backs but much of that was attributed to their skills as a wide receiver. Hopefully, Fichtner will get back to a simpler time when the best running back in the league runs the ball more and Pittsburgh's offense can focus more on execution and the team's strength and less on trickery.

Quick question — what is Canada's national sport? Or how about, where is the Ontario Lacrosse Hall of Fame located?
It's more likely that people will get the first question correct than the second.
While hockey is Canada's national sport of winter, Lacrosse is this country's national summer sport. As for the Ontario Lacrosse Hall of Fame – it proudly calls St. Catharines home.
Since 1992 the Hall has been housed inside the Welland Canals Centre on the Canal Parkway.
In fact, while lacrosse artifacts dating back hundreds of years are on display, 31 individuals from St. Catharines have been enshrined in the Ontario Lacrosse Hall of Fame.
There is no denying lacrosse's rich history in St. Catharines and, for that matter, the entire Niagara Region.
That's why Harry Erskine, and the St. Catharines junior A Athletics came up with “Lacrosse Day in Niagara.”
This year is not only Canada's 150th birthday, but it's also the 150th anniversary of summer's national sport, and the 140th anniversary of the Athletics franchise.
“Seeing that the St. Catharines Athletics were established in 1877, which makes the club one of the oldest sporting traditions in Canada, and that St. Catharines is the home of the Ontario Lacrosse Hall of Fame, it made it very easy for our board (of directors) to unanimously support the creation of Lacrosse Day in Niagara,” said Erskine, the current vice-president of the St. Catharines junior A Athletics.
“The goal of this event is to create a family, friendly, festival-like atmosphere that promotes and helps grow Canada's national summer sport, lacrosse.”
The second annual Lacrosse Day in Niagara will take place this Saturday from 4 to 9 p.m. at Jack Gatecliff and Rex Stimers arenas.
While the junior A Athletics offer the highest level of lacrosse in Niagara, there are three junior B teams as well.
The St. Catharines Spartans, Welland Generals, and Niagara Thunderhawks — who play out of Niagara-on-the-Lake – are part of the almost 700 individuals who played or are playing lacrosse this year in Niagara. Add in coaches and volunteers, and you're comfortably close to 1,000 people directly involved with the sport of lacrosse.
That includes the St. Catharines Minor Athletics, Welland Raiders, and Niagara Thunderhawks Minor Lacrosse associations.
Kellie Bousfield, the box lacrosse registrar for the St. Catharines Minor Lacrosse Athletics, reports 438 kids signed up in the Garden City in 2017.
Welland and Niagara-on-the-Lake boast very similar numbers as around 130 youngsters took to the floors and fields this year for their respective organizations according to registrar's Spencer Tanguay and Allison Price.
It should be mentioned that the Welland minor lacrosse program will be moving to Pelham in 2018 and playing out of the Community Centre and twin-pad arenas currently under construction there.
“Initially founded as a Pelham Centennial Project, it was fitting that the Raiders announced in Canada's 150th year that they will be returning home,” Pelham Mayor Dave Augustyn said.
“We are absolutely delighted that the Raiders have signed a five-year binding agreement to use the Pelham Community Centre.”
And while, at a grass roots level, the game of lacrosse continues to grow it's also expanding exponentially south of the border.
The United States is indeed known more for field lacrosse, and Canada its box (arena) game, but many Canadian teenagers are earning lacrosse scholarships south of the border.
No fewer than nine St. Catharines junior A Athletics are on or will be on, NCAA Division 1 scholarships. That includes Hunter Garlent, Logan Munroe and Owen Friesen at Canisius. Alex Simmons at Denver, Brett Erskine at Detroit Mercy, Bryan Hancock at Hobart, Carter Zavitz at Princeton and Percy Booth and Mason Kaminga at Hartford.
Add in the three local junior B teams, and players from Niagara attending U.S. colleges and universities easily exceed 20.
And the ones not plying their trade in the states are staying to play field lacrosse at the Canadian University level.
Brock University, for instance, features 10 local players from all over the Niagara Region and all four local junior clubs.
They include Cree Blakely, (St. Catharines – Jr. A Athletics) Adam Kirchmayer (Welland – last club St. Catharines Spartans and former Welland Warlord/General) Drew Popadinac (Niagara Falls – Jr. A Athletics) Alec Tamas (St. Catharines – Jr. A Athletics) Luke McLeod (Grimsby – last club St. Catharines Spartans) Josh Wood (Welland) Connor Smith (Beamsville – St. Catharines Spartans) Kyle Pedwell (St. Catharines – last club Niagara Thunderhawks) Josh Harris (St. Catharines – former Jr. A Athletic and Welland Warlord) Nico Beaudoin (Welland – former Jr. A Athletic and Welland Warlord )
All of these junior players are trying to get to the next level by either playing in the NLL – National Lacrosse League (box lacrosse) or MLL - Major League Lacrosse (field lacrosse).
Many have already made their mark and continue to do so.
Billy Dee Smith a St. Catharines native, and former Jr. A Athletic and Spartan junior B player is the current captain of the Buffalo Bandits, while Danny Coates, a longtime St. Catharines resident, is the captain of the Colorado Mammoth.
Matt Vinc, a teacher at Denis Morris high school in St. Catharines, is arguably the best goaltender in the world.
Smith, Coates and Vinc also represent the country on the national level playing field lacrosse for Team Canada.
Players from St. Catharines or Niagara that have donned NLL jerseys include Steve Priolo (Buffalo Bandits), Corey Small (Vancouver Stealth), Joel McCready (Vancouver Stealth) Zac Reid (New England Blackwolves), Tyson Bell (Calgary Roughnecks) and Latrell Harris (Toronto Rock).
So if you're not doing anything Saturday perhaps head down to Jack Gatecliff and Rex Stimers Arenas and take in Canada's national summer sport on the second annual Lacrosse Day in Niagara.
Perhaps Steve Priolo recently said it best.
“Wearing the double blue of the St. Catharines Athletics to me meant playing with so much heart and passion, that I would inspire someone in my community to become great, like the players that inspired me.”
MOSCOW (AP) — Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday denied reports of intercepted phone calls between Russian intelligence officials and members of Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The New York Times said that the Russians made contact with Paul Manafort, who briefly served as Trump's campaign chairperson. Current and former U.S. officials interviewed by the Times declined to identify other Trump associates contacted by the Russians.
Speaking to reporters in Moscow, Peskov, spokesperson for President Vladimir Putin, pointed to the anonymity of the sources, saying that the reports “are not based on any facts, do not point to actual facts.”
The report comes a day after U.S. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigned following reports they misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about their contacts with Russia.
Asked about the allegations, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday they “prove once against there is a major internal, political game, you can call it bargaining, in the United States.”
Russian lawmakers were more direct in trying to defend Trump.
“This is not about information but about a high-precision information bomb,” Alexei Pushkov, chairperson of the Federation Council's information committee, tweeted. “The goal is to blow up the Trump administration.”
Once a month, Heidi Selken steps in front of a video camera and talks to a few hundred fourth-grade students about dairy farming … as well as anyone else who might choose to tune in on the South Dakota Adopt-A-Farmer YouTube channel. Selken is herd manager at Boadwine Farms Inc., near the Baltic, in the southeast part of the state, “about 16 miles from the closest Walmart,” they remark.
The proximity to larger population centers is important here because Selken, like an increasing number of producers and farm managers, recognizes the need to tell agriculture's story to a highly connected yet mostly urban world of consumers.
“The benefit is nobody knows what we do unless we tell them,” Selken explains. “The more we can show them, the better off we are. Not everybody can come out to the farm and visit, and see firsthand what we do.”
TELL YOUR OWN STORY
Boadwine Farms, owned by Lynn and Trish Boadwine, has a milking herd of 2,100 cows, occupies 2,500 acres, most of it cultivated in alfalfa and corn, and employs 40 people.
Selken has played the leading role the last four years in a series of five- to seven-minute videos geared toward southeast South Dakota's fourth-graders. They have found a relatively seamless route to getting kids on the farm without actually bussing them there. Through a program operated by AG United for South Dakota, Boadwine Farms partners with a local FFA student who comes out once a month to film farm happenings.
Selken has covered topics ranging from what happens inside a milking parlor to how to care for calves in the winter. They say their focus is generally animal husbandry since children are getting the nutrition side of dairy education in school.
“By doing the video once a month, it's a small glimpse into the farm, maybe what you're doing that day or that time of year,” they say. “The most recent was on pumping manure and putting it on the fields as fertilizer to teach students it's not just waste; it has another purpose.”
Don Schindler is digital strategy and executive social media trainer with Dairy Management Inc. (DMI), in Rosemont, Illinois. They say the “virtual farm tours” that ag professionals such as Selken do is critical in a digitally connected world where farmers are increasingly victims of unwarranted negative publicity, much of it on social media channels.
“There's a lot of misinformation out there, and someone needs to be watching what's going on and go out there and talk on behalf of farmers and help farmers to engage [the public],” they point out.
COMBAT MISINFORMATION
Schindler says DMI has “a very robust school program where we bus kids out to farms,” but they acknowledge that doing so is not only expensive but increasingly difficult with regulations related to farm access. That's not an excuse for failing to get the word out, however. “Sixty-four percent of teens don't know anyone who works in ag,” they add. “Farms are now very exotic to kids.”
Hence, DMI, like many ag organizations, is promoting the concept of virtual farm tours and working to get its membership on the bandwagon. “The goals [of a virtual farm tour] are the same as with an actual farm tour,” Schindler says. “The only difference is you're not physically there.”
They say most of DMI's work in virtual farm tours is geared toward the classroom, and many DMI members are posting virtual tours on their websites, Facebook pages, YouTube channels and other social media outlets. “The technology is getting a lot easier and a lot more affordable,” they note. If you can take a video with your iPhone, you can do a virtual farm tour.
Stacy Dohle, senior communications manager with Midwest Dairy Association, says in May 2016, their organization conducted a pilot program on virtual farm tours, starting with two farms in Nebraska. Out of that, the association developed a virtual farm tour toolkit.
“We have to be proactive, not reactive,” Dohle says. “It doesn't have to be a 20-minute farm tour. It can be a little minute segment you post on Facebook or Twitter.” They point to Selken's short videos as an excellent example. “People will watch a 30-second video more than they will a three- or four-minute one.”
“People are questioning where their food is coming from,” Schindler says. “When Grandpa was farming, people trusted them because they knew them personally, and 25% of America was farming.” Schindler says producers need to keep in mind that most consumers live in urban areas and don't understand what farmers do.
“A lot of companies are capitalizing on irresponsible marketing about what's happening on the farm,” Schindler adds. “You have to tell your story, or someone else will do it for you.”
Virtual Farm Tours: Tips to Get Started:
— Contact your local, state or regional farm/commodity organizations or cooperative Extension to get help and advice on creating a virtual farm tour.
— Use Midwest Dairy Association's Virtual Farm Tour Activation Toolkit as a guide to get started: www.midwestdairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Virtual-Farm-Tour-Toolkit.pdf.
— If you don't already have one, get a Facebook page. “It's the largest and strongest social media platform out there,” Dairy Management Inc.'s Don Schindler says. And it's a great place to post those virtual farm tours.
— Take advantage of live-streaming opportunities on Facebook, where you can give a tour to your social media audience in real time. “Facebook Live videos are very in the moment and authentic,” Schindler says.
— Other virtual tour posting options include Zoom Technology and GoToMeeting.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is working with Google to develop its future infotainment system software, and will show a concept of that integration at this week's Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The demonstration involves a Chrysler 300 that has had its 8.4-inch Uconnect display software replaced with a system based on Google's Android 7.0 Nougat.
FCA says that working with Google would allow the company to retain the feel and functionality of its current Uconnect infotainment system (pictured above) while integrating the many features and apps available for Android devices. The Android open-source operating system is widely used on tablets and smartphones. The demo at CES will show that the in-car system can control not just climate control and the radio, but also works with apps like Google Maps, Pandora, Spotify, NPR One, Pocket Casts, and Google Assistant.
“This collaboration with Google has been an extremely beneficial opportunity for both companies to explore how in-vehicle infotainment and connectivity technology continues to evolve, and what it takes to meet consumers' increasing desire for innovation of information with minimal distraction,” Chris Barman, FCA head of electrical engineering, said in a statement.
FCA will not hold a press conference at this month's Detroit Auto Show to focus its attention on CES, signaling the brand's attention to in-car technology. The automaker already has a partnership with Google subsidiary Waymo to develop a fleet of self-driving Pacifica Hybrid minivan prototypes.
Many car infotainment systems already support Android Auto, which allows smartphone owners to use their device's features on the car's built-in display.

DECATUR, Ga. (AP) — Another major highway through Atlanta is closed, this one because an underground gas leak caused the fast lane to buckle. A motorcyclist hit the rising pavement at high speed and was critically injured after being flung into the air.
The pavement rose to nearly the height of a full-grown man before splitting into several pieces, witnesses said.
DeKalb County spokesperson Andrew Cauthen says the man was hospitalized with multiple fractures after an underground gas leak buckled the HOV lane of Interstate 20.
County spokesperson Sarah Page said all westbound lanes are closed until further notice several miles southeast of downtown Atlanta.

This latest infrastructure problem will only snarl more traffic in the congested city, adding east-west complications to commutes already complicated by the collapse of an overpass on Interstate 85, a key north-south artery, due to an arson fire.

They were the one to take the fall, but Ben Duckett wasn't the only member of the England touring party to act out of order during a drinking session in Perth last week.
Duckett, a member of Andy Flower's Lions squad, was last week stood down from England's drawn two-day tour match against a Cricket Australia XI in Perth for pouring a beer over vice-captain, James Anderson.
The left-handed batsman, capped four times for England in Test cricket, wasn't sent home from the Lions' tour but fined half their tour fee ($2666) and relegated to 12th man duties for the three remaining T20 fixtures for the incident.
The pair is said to have continued to socialise happily together, but the incident was the latest in a series of off-field incidents that has seen the tourist's culture come under severe criticism.
While it was initially believed that Duckett was the only Englishman to play up at The Avenue — the same venue where wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow greeted Australian rookie batsman Cameron Bancroft with a headbutt in October — The Times is reporting that they aren't alone in playing up.
“Ben Duckett escaped being sent home from England Lions' tour to Australia but was left to take the blame for a night out on which other players were committing the same trivial and childish offence of pouring drinks over one another,” Will Macpherson wrote for The Times.
Only two weeks earlier, England director Andrew Strauss had implemented a team curfew following their first Test loss against Australia at the Gabba, after Bairstow's drinking related incident in Perth to start the tour.
By that point England's culture had already been subjected to criticism following Ben Stokes' alcohol fuelled incident in Bristol in September, which has seen them a glaring omission from the side.
While the curfew had been lifted to allow England's players to go The Avenue, The Times wrote England's management had warned the large group of players venturing out on the town to be on their best behaviour.
“Having lost the second Test in Adelaide, the senior team's curfew was softened on Thursday, the first night they were in Perth,” Macpherson wrote.
“A quiz for players and support staff, hosted by Gary Ballance, Jake Ball and the massage therapist Mark Saxby, was followed by players being allowed out to one bar which, somehow, happened to be The Avenue.
“Before leaving the hotel, Joe Root — who did not go out — and Trevor Bayliss dished out a stern warning about player conduct. Ten of the Test squad and at least as many Lions headed to The Avenue.”
The latest incident provided more context into Darren Gough's Tweet, who earlier wrote that he'd “love to have a little wager on” Duckett not being the only player to have played up.
It also continued to paint a grim picture of England's side.
Not a day goes by without England's management and playing group being asked about the side's culture.
In their most recent column, ex-England captain Mike Atherton lamented their former side's ill-discipline and reflected on how differently the series could have been had it not been for a long night out in England's south west.
“Can we go back and start again?” Atherton wrote for The Times.
“Maybe rewind the clock, to just before the early hours in Bristol on September 25, and hope for a different turn of events? English cricket would dearly wish to be able to do so, thereby avoiding an event that has framed the whole context of this tour and continues to define it, on and off the field.
“They are missing Ben Stokes, of course they are. The realisation is heightened by the venue for the next Test, Perth, where they first came to international recognition four years ago, scoring a brilliant hundred against a rampant Australia attack, driving and pulling even the quickest bowlers on a fast pitch.
“Off the field, the impact of their suspension has been, if possible, even greater.”
Topeka Police were threatened by a machete-wielding man early Saturday at the Law Enforcement Center.
According to a release, the man said they had a bomb in addition to the machete.
Topeka Police Officers isolated them outside the LEC and initiated communications that continued for over an hour.
The male subsequently came toward officers aggressively with their machete and they were “Tased”.
They were taken into custody receiving only superficial injuries. No officers were injured in this incident.
Anthony Hernandez of Topeka was booked into the Shawnee County Dept. of Corrections for Aggravated Assault on a Law Enforcement Officer, Criminal Threat, and other charges.

“We need a chief financial officer of the state who is willing to make tough decisions and weigh in on policy, whether it's federal block grants or school finance or PERA [the state's Public Employees' Retirement Association] or even tax increases for funding for transportation, which are completely unnecessary, by the way,” Everett told The Colorado Statesman in an interview on Monday. “That's why we're announcing on tax day — the No. 1 job of the treasurer is to protect taxpayers, and I'm not afraid to make tough decisions that affect taxpayers on policy.”
Everett, who was elected to their third term representing Jefferson County's House District 22 in November, is the first Republican to declare he's running in what could be a crowded primary field. The incumbent, Republican Walker Stapleton, is term-limited and is considering a run for governor. State Rep. Steve Lebsock, a Thornton Democrat, several weeks ago became the first candidate to announce a bid for the office.
Known around the Capitol as “Dr. No” and “Justin Neverett” — “I have a reputation for voting ‘no' quite a bit and being the adult in the room,” they say, shrugging at organizations that consistently rank them as the most negative lawmaker and the most conservative one to boot —Everett prides themselves on reading every line of every bill and every amendment before casting their vote, and they say that's a reason they vote against measures more often than not.
“It's my responsibility as a state representative,” Everett said, expressing some dismay that the practice counts as anything special, although they acknowledge it's a distinction he'll point out when people ask why they vote “no” so often.
“A lot of bills sound great until you read everything that's in them,” they said with a smile. “Even though my positions may not all be politically popular, I feel very confident with what I've done the last five years looking out for taxpayers and making sure we're fiscally responsible.”
The state treasurer manages roughly $6.5 billion in more than 750 state funds and is an ex officio member of the PERA board.
Everett noted that he's run a number of bills addressing PERA's operations and said they plan to focus on the retirement plan if he's elected.
“We have a $30 billion unfunded liability with PERA,” they said. “It needs more transparency — we need to find out what that number is and what their investment strategy is. We've kicked the can so far down the road, we're going to have to make tougher decisions than we would have in the past.”
While they say Stapleton has done a good job with the office's many duties, Everett said they plan to take a look at the office's investment strategy with an eye toward increasing yields on the state's funds.
“We can always do better,” they said. “We're looking at a 1 1/2-2 percent return; why can't we be at 3 or 4 percent while still minimizing risk? You want to be conservative enough where we are not putting things at risk but aggressive enough that we can grow our portfolio.”
In addition, they said they envision a more vocal role as treasurer.
“I think you need to have a treasurer willing to weigh in on more fiscal issues and have a louder voice, especially things coming down from Washington,” Everett said.
Noting that they have an MBA with an emphasis on finance and investments —he consulted on raising venture capital and managing growth for startups before transitioning to work focusing on alternative dispute resolution — Everett said he'll consider getting a Bloomberg terminal to provide the office with immediate market intelligence for the occasions when that's essential.
Other Republicans said to be considering a run for state treasurer include state Rep. Polly Lawrence, R-Roxborough Park, business person and former legislative candidate Brian Watson, Routt County Treasurer Brita Horn and Republican National Committeeman and former congressional candidate George Leing.
“I don't think anyone else thinking of running has a record of protecting taxpayers and making fiscal responsible decisions,” Everett said. “You want somebody you can rely on and can count on based on what they've done.”
Everett said they plan to go through the caucus and assembly process to get on next year's primary ballot.
While he's been traveling the state representing the House GOP caucus at Lincoln Day dinners and other Republican events — visiting 18 counties in the past two months, they said — Everett admitted that it's not a bad way for a potential statewide candidate to get to know voters, either.
““We cannot ignore rural Colorado and other parts of the state that are not metro Denver. Anyone who's running for statewide office has to realize that,” they said. “No one's going to outwork me.”

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — Israel is attempting to lead the peace process with Palestine into a "dark tunnel," Palestinian Ambassador to Russia Abdel Hafiz Nofal told Sputnik on Thursday.
"Anyone who follows the political situation in the Middle East could have noticed that Israel seeks to lead this process into a dark tunnel," Nofal said.
They named Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent calls to "disband" the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) as one of the examples. Israeli lawmakers also voted to deduct money transfers to the Palestinian Authority this week, they added.
"We should not forget that Israel is still continuing to expand its settlement activities in the West Bank and the rest of Palestine," Nofal said.
The envoy stressed the need to "increase international efforts," noting that "despite the importance of more than 20 years of negotiations with the Israelis, we are moving into a very difficult dimension."
"We believe that an international conference under the partnership efforts of Moscow and Washington is needed to solve this [the Israeli-Palestinian conflict]," Nofal said, offering Moscow as a possible venue to hold talks.
They stressed that "the final decision should be reached on the basis of this conference under the Russian and US auspices and with the participation of all interested parties."
"We are working on a project to supply Russian instead of Israeli oil and petrochemical products to Palestine," Nofal said.
Certain agreements have been reached during Palestinian National Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas' visit to Russia on May 11, the envoy noted.
"We really hope that we will soon be able to see serious results, I look at it positively," they said.
Palestine is grateful to Moscow for its decision not to move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem until the two Middle Eastern states resolve their long-standing territorial dispute, Nofal told Sputnik.
On June 1, US President Donald Trump signed a waiver to keep the US diplomatic mission in Israel in Tel Aviv for at least six months instead of moving it to Jerusalem, despite their election campaign promises to make the move when elected into office. Last Thursday, Jerusalem Affairs and Environmental Protection Minister Ze'ev Elkin suggested that Russia could use this opportunity to become the first country to relocate its embassy to Jerusalem.
"We are grateful to the Russian authorities and to the Foreign Ministry for this decision. As far as we know, the Russian Foreign Ministry had considered the possibility of Jerusalem becoming the capital of two states at once. We highly appreciate the position of Russia on keeping the Russian embassy in Tel Aviv until the decision to establish the Palestinian state within 1967 borders and a capital in East Jerusalem has been carried out," Nofal said.
The ambassador noted that the relocation of the Russian embassy is a secondary issue, while the recognition of the Palestinian borders, as they were in 1967, and of East Jerusalem as its capital is the primary matter.
"We, Palestinians, often say that Jerusalem should become the city that is open to all: Christians, Muslims, Jews, a city that is open politically and economically. However, it is only possible after Israel recognizes Palestine's right to self-determination," the ambassador said.

Israel's decision to approve the construction of 8,000 housing units in the occupied West Bank territories is bringing the idea of the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute to an impasse, the Palestinian ambassador to Russia told Sputnik.
Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Sunday that Israel had approved over 8,000 new homes since the beginning of the year, with over 3,000 marked for immediate construction. This is a record volume of construction unseen in over two decades.
"Undoubtedly [such actions hinder the settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict]," the ambassador said.
Nofal said that Palestine was seriously worried about this decision to construct new homes.
"In particular, we are afraid that following this active expansion, we will simply have nothing to negotiate with as they [Israel] will capture all of the land… If all this territory [of the West Bank] is annexed by Israel, what will we negotiate about with them then?" the ambassador said.
Palestinians seek diplomatic recognition for their independent state on the territories of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which is partially occupied by Israel, and the Gaza Strip. Israel has been building settlements on the occupied territories despite objections from the United Nations.
The Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been a matter of global concern with the issue engaging international mediators. The Middle East Quartet, consisting of the United Nations, the United States, Russia and the European Union, has been active since 2002. The Quartet is focused on support for Palestine in developing economy, public institutions, rule of law in the West Bank and Gaza.
Mancia said the goal is for the book to feel like a "kitchen companion" with an empowering voice, one focused more on solid technique than a product sales pitch. Castle achieves this by providing engaging history and insights on dozens of dishes. They also offer informative breakouts that spotlight techniques or ingredients some home cooks may not be familiar with. You might need a restorative nip of cognac after reading their sensual take on the luxurious delights of 82 per cent butterfat French butter.
If you're looking for something special to make, Castle considers the boeuf bourguignon a true standout, though it's equally appropriate for formal or casual dining.
"It's one of those dishes people think of when they think about great French food," they say. "When it's made well, it's just astonishing."
While they aren't responsible for testing any of the recipes, this was among the first recipes in the book Castle made for pleasure in their own kitchen.
"It's nice and homey, as it should be," they say. "And it's best made ahead, which makes it great for entertaining. There's nothing worse that a host who misses their own party because they're stuck in the kitchen."
A great dinner deserves a great dessert, and this book offers several tempting options. If you're not confident about trying a chocolate soufflé, Castle says the chocolate pots de creme are well within reach of most home cooks.
"They are intensely chocolatey but not overly sweet," says Castle. "Your own pot de creme can't be beat. People are charmed and touched by having their own individual serving."

BOEUF BOURGUIGNON
If you want to capture the heart and soul of simple French cooking in a single pot, then make boeuf bourguignon. The recipe is rooted in Burgundy, home to world-class red wines and also to the Charolais cattle that were once the preferred source of beef for this recipe. Leave it to the French to care about a signature dish so deeply that they have a favourite kind of cow to use in it.
For making boeuf bourguignon stateside, opt for high-quality and well-marbled chuck steak, an economical cut perfectly suited for a long, slow simmer in red wine that turns it tender and delicious, transforming this peasant dish into something elegant, filling, and sure to become a family favourite.
For the stew:
2 cups beef broth
10 ounces slab or thick-cut bacon, cut into lardons
3 to 3 1/2 pounds lean chuck steak, cut into 2-inch chunks
3 cups full-bodied, dry red Burgundy or pinot noir
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 tablespoons tomato paste
2 medium carrots, cut into thin rounds
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
1 bouquet garni
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
5 large shallots, thinly sliced
14 ounces gourmet mushroom blend, cut or torn into bite-sized pieces
For the Beurre Manie:
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
Balsamic vinegar and chopped flat-leaf parsley (for garnish)
To make the stew: In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, simmer the beef stock until reduced to 1 cup, about 15 minutes. Set aside.
Place the bacon in an unheated Dutch oven, then cook over medium heat, stirring often, until rendered and crisp, about 20 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate. Reserve the fat in the pot.
Increase the heat to medium-high. Working in batches, add the beef to the pot and cook until deeply seared and browned on all sides, turning with tongs, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Deglaze the pot with 1 cup of the wine, stirring to loosen the fond from the bottom of the pot. Return the bacon and seared meat to the pot. Stir in the remaining wine, 1 cup at a time, letting it reduce slightly and stirring well after each addition.
Stir in the reserved beef broth, garlic, tomato paste, carrots, salt, pepper, and bouquet garni. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer gently until the meat is spoon tender, about 2 hours. Discard the bouquet garni.
In a medium skillet over medium heat, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter. Stir in the shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are deeply caramelized, 15 to 20 minutes. Scrape into a bowl. Melt the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter in the same skillet and stir in the mushrooms. Cook, stirring often, until browned and tender, about 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat.
To make the beurre manie: In a small bowl, stir together the butter and flour to form thick paste. Roll into balls the size of marbles. Bring the stew to a low boil and whisk in the beurre manie balls one at a time. Continue to cook until the stew thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. Stir in the reserved shallots and mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish each serving with a few drops of balsamic vinegar and a sprinkle of parsley.
Yield: Makes 8 to 10 servings.

GARLIC AND HERB GOUGERES
The airy cheese puffs known as gougeres make fantastic hors d'oeuvres. Served warm or at room temperature, they are often the first morsel delivered to the table in the restaurants and cafés of Burgundy. They start with pte a choux, the same dough used for cream puffs, eclairs, and profiteroles, but the dough for gougeres is infused with freshly grated Gruyere, rather than filled with pastry cream. They are a reliable make-ahead item to keep in your freezer. Freeze the uncooked gougeres right on the baking sheet after piping. When solid, transfer them into a freezer bag. There's no need to thaw them before baking. Just pop them back onto a pan and bake as directed, adding 1 to 2 additional minutes in the oven.
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup whole milk
10 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 cup all-purpose flour
4 large eggs
1 cup freshly grated Gruyere cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
In a medium saucepan, bring the water, milk and butter to a boil, stirring occasionally to melt the butter. Add the flour and stir vigorously until the mixture is smooth and thick. Continue cooking, stirring constantly, until the dough pulls away from the sides of the pan, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and let stand until the dough no longer steams and is warm to the touch, 3 to 5 minutes.
Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring vigorously until well blended after each addition. Stir in the cheese, thyme, rosemary, garlic, salt, pepper and nutmeg.
Place the dough in a pastry bag fitted with a 1-inch tip. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat and pipe mounds the size of walnuts onto the prepared sheet, spacing them 2 inches apart. (Alternatively, pipe the dough from a sturdy freezer bag with one corner snipped away or portion it with a 1/2-ounce ice cream scoop or two spoons. Use a dampened fingertip to pat down any dimples on top of the mounds.)
Bake until puffed and golden brown, about 20 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
Yield: Makes 2 dozen.

CHOCOLATE POTS DE CREME
There is nothing plain about simple desserts made perfectly, such as these cups of silky dark chocolate custard. The French regard chocolate with reverence and respect, so be sure to use high-quality chocolate. For this version, pinches of salt and fiery cayenne pepper in the toasted almond topping add a contemporary touch to a classic dessert.
For the custard:
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1 cup whole milk
5 ounces bittersweet chocolate (70 per cent cacao), chopped
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
Pinch of kosher salt
6 large egg yolks
1/3 cup sugar
For the spiced almonds:
1/2 cup raw slivered almonds
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
Pinch of kosher salt
Pinch of cayenne pepper
Lightly sweetened whipped cream (for garnish)
Fresh chopped mint (for garnish)
To make the custards: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. The custards will bake in a hot water bath, so arrange six 6-ounce ramekins in a roasting pan or large baking dish that is at least 2 inches deep.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring the cream and milk to a simmer. Remove the pan from the heat, add the chocolate, and let stand until the chocolate begins to soften. Whisk until melted and smooth, then whisk in the vanilla and salt.
In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. Whisking constantly, add the warm cream mixture in a slow, steady stream. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Let stand 10 minutes, then skim any foam from the surface.
Evenly divide the custard among the ramekins. Pour enough hot tap water into the roasting pan to reach halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake until the custards are set, but the centers still jiggle slightly when shaken gently, about 40 minutes. Remove the ramekins from the water bath and refrigerate until chilled, about 3 hours.
For the almonds: In a dry, heavy skillet over medium heat, toast the almonds, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate, drizzle with the butter, sprinkle with the salt and cayenne, and toss to coat. Let cool, and then chop coarsely.
Just before serving, garnish the custards with whipped cream, spiced almonds and mint.
Yield: 6 servings

LOS ANGELES (AP) - Barbra Streisand said she's never suffered sexual harassment but has felt abused by the media.
During a tribute to Streisand's decades of TV music specials and other programs, producer and long-time admirer Ryan Murphy queried them about their career, the #MeToo movement and their aversion to interviews.
"Never," they replied when asked if they had been sexually mistreated. "I wasn't like those pretty girls with those nice little noses. Maybe that's why."
They acknowledged the power of protests against gender inequality sweeping through Hollywood and society.
"We're in a strange time now in terms of men and women and the pendulum swinging this way and that way, and it's going to have to come to the center," Streisand said during Friday's Paley Center for Media event held at a packed theater.
Them reluctance to talk to news outlets is based on years of what they called inaccurate reporting, including one story that claimed they have an "awards room" at home dedicated to their Oscars, Emmys and other trophies. But it was the late TV journalist Mike Wallace who came in for the sharpest criticism.
Streisand said they asked their hurtful questions during a TV interview and they called them afterward to complain. But on a subsequent show, Wallace told viewers who'd objected to their treatment of Streisand that they "loved" the interview, according to the star.
"I thought, I don't know what date rape is, it's terrible ... but it was such a violation," they said. "Why lie?"
Wallace's tough questioning brought Streisand to tears on a 1991 interview on "60 Minutes."
Streisand said they demand control in their work but only in service to their art that's included directing, acting and producing TV movies, among them 1995's "Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story," about anti-gay discrimination in the military.
Murphy ("Glee," ''American Horror Story"), who admitted to being nervous as they began their one-on-one conversation with the star of "Funny Girl" and award-winning TV specials dating back to 1966's "Color Me Barbra," said they owed their career to them
"People talk about Barbra as the greatest female star. I say, no, that's not enough," Murphy said, calling them a groundbreaker for those who don't fit the mold. "She was a touchstone, a beacon I followed my entire life.
The tribute, which kicked off the 35th annual PaleyFest LA television festival at the Dolby Theatre, was capped by the presentation to Streisand of the 2018 PaleyFest Icon award.
Streisand is a "truly magical artist," Maureen J. Reidy, Paley Center president and CEO, said of their work as a singer, actor, director and producer.
Streisand also is known for their political activism on behalf of Democratic candidates and issues including gay rights.

A more sustainable School Feeding Programme plugged for Guyana
DPI/GINA, GUYANA, Wednesday, June 14, 2017
Development partner agency the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has engaged government officials with the ultimate goal of having a sustainable School Feeding Programme developed and incorporated into government policy.
A sustainable School Feeding Programme should offer healthy food in adequate quantity and quality, using fresh products in accordance with the culture and local food preference. This will extensively allow for optimization of the growth, development and health of the students. The development of appropriate menues is one of the critical elements in this process.
The FAO hosted a ministerial discussion with these attendees looking at Food and Nutrition Security and Sustainable School feeding in Guyana where various government ministries were represented by their ministers and senior officials.
Based on a presentation by FAO's country representative, Rueben Robertson, school feeding should be a multi-sectoral policy programme, which will allow Guyana to achieve goals in various strategic areas such as education, public health, agriculture, social protection, social cohesion and business.
“We have the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and we are speaking about focusing on what we call the five P's (Planet, People, Prosperity, Peace and Partnership). So sustainable school feeding nutrition programmes and SDGs are important components of countries social policy and could contribute directly to the eradication of poverty.” Robertson explained.
Ministers of Public Health, Agriculture, Social Protection and Social Cohesion all voiced their concerns about the factors to be taken into consideration in moving forward with such an initiative. The ministers all supported the idea of a Sustainable School Feeding programme and vowed to work towards making the initiative a government policy.
Robertson's presentation highlighted that it is a fundamental right for every citizen to have access to food as recognised by the United Nations. They said that School Feeding can be the core of government's policies to eliminate hunger countrywide.
“Why are nutrition sensitive interventions important at schools? this is where we want to ground the sustainable School Feeding having
looked at the challenges some of the opportunities, what we have committed ourselves to and the multi-disciplinary inter-sectoral, multi-dimensional nature. We want to see how School Feeding really fits into all of this and we are saying here that malnutrition is a global challenge and in Guyana undernourishment is greater than ten per cent.” The FAO Representative said.
Representatives from the Ministry of Education outlined that there are at least five activities executed by the ministry under it school feeding programme. This programme currently provides one healthy meal for at least 22,000 students in 158 schools across Guyana.
These activities include the Breakfast programme, the juice and biscuit for students along the coastland areas, the Dora feeding programme on the Linden, Soesdyke Highway, the peanut butter and cassava bread programme in Region Nine and the community based school feeding programme in Regions One, Seven, Eight and Nine.
The Ministers of Public Health indicated that the ministry will remain committed to ensure that the quality of meals provided are healthy and are of the right standard which will guarantee total health of children. Meanwhile, work is continuing to have Food Based Dietary Guidelines (FBDG) which will promote a balanced diet, represented by the six food groups staples, vegetables, fruits, legumes, animals and fats.
Some of the benefits of a sustainable school feeding programme include stronger inter-sectoral co-ordination, development of children's cognitive skills, encourages at least one healthy meal, promotion of domestic food systems, job creation, elimination of hunger and most importantly poverty reduction.

29-year-old man was sent to hospital with serious injuries
Peel Regional Police are looking for these three men in connection with a brutal assault on a man with autism on March 13. (Peel Regional Police)
Police in Ontario say they believe that at least one of three men who beat up a man with autism in the greater Toronto area could be from the Lower Mainland.
Peel Regional Police say the assault happened at the Square One bus terminal in Mississauga on March 13 at about 10:45 p.m.
The 29-year-old man was sitting at the bottom of the stairs of the terminal's lower level when three men approached.
The suspects surrounded them and “continued to punch and kick the male multiple times” before fleeing.
The man was taken to hospital with serious but non-life-threatening injuries.
“We believe at least one might be from British Columbia,” said Const. Iryna Yashnyk. “We're hoping to get the video out there in case somebody might recognize them.”
WATCH: Police provide a video of the assault
Note: Footage may be disturbing to some viewers
The first suspect is described as a 5'10” South Asian man with a light complexion, short dark beard and short black hair cut. They were wearing a black T-shirt with a red Air Jordan logo and white Jordan lettering, with black track pants and black shoes.
The second suspect is described as a thin, clean shaven 5'10” South Asian man with a light complexion. They were wearing a black jacket with a grey horizontal stripe across the chest and a grey vertical stripe along the hood, black track pants and black shoes.
The third suspect is described as an unshaven 5'10” South Asian man with a medium complexion. They had a medium build and was wearing a black hoodie with a Nike logo and white Nike lettering along the sleeves, with black track pants and black shoes.
Anyone with any information is asked to call the 12 Division Criminal Investigation Bureau at 905-453-2121, ext. 1233, or if they wish to remain anonymous, to call Peel Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477, visit their website or text 27467 with the world ‘peel' and their tip.

LONDON: British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Friday they would stay on as leader to provide stability after a former chairperson of their Conservative Party said they had garnered the support of 30 lawmakers who wanted them to quit.
May is trying to face down a rebellion by some of their own lawmakers just as Britain enters a crucial stage in Brexit talks, 18 months before the country leaves the European Union and must redefine its place in the world.
Some Conservative plotters say their authority is shattered beyond repair after a disastrous speech at their party's conference, which comes after they called a snap election and lost their party its majority in parliament.
Speaking from their parliamentary constituency of Maidenhead in southern England, May said in a televised statement:
“What the country needs is calm leadership and that's what I‘m providing with the full support of my cabinet.”
Senior ministers rallied around May, who has just over a year to agree a divorce deal with the EU ahead of Britain's exit in March 2019. May said they planned to hold a scheduled meeting about Brexit with business leaders on Monday in Downing Street.
But former party chairperson Grant Shapps told BBC radio: “I think they should call a leadership election.”
After May's bungled election, their failure to unite the cabinet and a poor party conference “the writing is on the wall,” they said.
May's authority was already diminished by their decision to call a snap election in June that lost their party its majority in parliament days before Brexit talks opened.
Though no Conservative ministers have publicly indicated any support for the plot, such a blunt demand for May to quit indicates the extent of their weakness while they attempt to navigate the intricacies of the negotiations to leave the EU.
Them survival has so far been dependent on the absence of an obvious successor who could unite the party and the fear of an election that many Conservatives think would let opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn into power.
Sterling fell earlier in the day but then rallied by around a quarter of a cent against the U.S. dollar following May's remarks.
Serious Plot?
May's speech to activists on Wednesday was ruined by coughing fits, a comedian handing them a bogus employment termination notice and by letters falling off the slogans on the set behind them
They had hoped to use the speech to their party in the northern English city of Manchester to revive their premiership.
“Look, I've had a cold all this week,” May said, adding that they would be updating lawmakers next week on their Brexit plans and introducing a draft bill to cap domestic energy prices.
Shapps, who chaired the party between 2012 and 2015, said the plot to remove them existed before this week's party conference and included both supporters and opponents of Brexit. They said the group did not have a unified view on who should replace May.
To trigger a formal leadership challenge, 48 Conservative lawmakers need to write to the chairperson of the party's so-called 1922 committee.
“Number 10 must be delighted to learn that it's Grant Shapps leading this alleged coup,” Charles Walker, vice-chairperson of the 1922 committee, told BBC radio.
“Grant has many talents, but one thing they don't have is a following in the party, so really I think this is now just going to fizzle out to be perfectly honest.”
If May stays, talks on leaving the European Union will be guided by one of the weakest leaders in recent British history. EU diplomats and officials expressed astonishment about the uncertainty in London.
“She should stay”
Supporters, including their most senior ministers, said they should remain in charge to deliver Brexit.
Under the headline ‘Theresa May will stay as Prime Minister and get the job done,' interior minister Amber Rudd wrote in The Telegraph newspaper that “she should stay”. May's de facto deputy Damian Green said they would carry on. Environment Secretary Michael Gove also said they hoped they would continue.
“I know that they are as determined as ever to get on with the job, they see it as their duty to do so and they will carry on and they will make a success of this government,” Green, the first secretary of state, told BBC television.
Many Conservative activists fear a leadership contest would exacerbate the divide in the party over Europe, an issue that helped sink the previous three Conservative prime ministers – David Cameron, John Major and Margaret Thatcher.
A leadership contest could also pave the way for an election that some Conservatives worry could be won by Corbyn, whom they cast as a Marxist who would reverse decades of free market policies.
“The Conservatives have no plan for Britain and their posturing will not deliver the change our country is crying out for,” Corbyn said on Friday.
(CBS Local) – Gun owners around the country are blowing up expensive coolers after the NRA accused outdoor lifestyle company Yeti of joining a nationwide boycott of the gun-rights organization.
According to a letter from Marion P. Hammer of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, Yeti has cut ties with the NRA and is refusing to do business with the NRA Foundation or offer discounts to members. “YETI should be ashamed. They have declined to continue helping America's young people enjoy outdoor recreational activities,” Hammer claims in the April 20 statement.
In response to the news, NRA members and supporters have begun taking their frustrations out on the company's hottest item: outdoor coolers. In a number of online videos boycotting Yeti, gun owners are seen destroying the expensive containers by loading them with explosives and shooting them. “This Yeti ain't ready,” South Carolina resident Bryan Atkinson declared before obliterating theirs cooler.
The pricey coolers reportedly cost anywhere between $250 and $1,300; making a discount on Yeti camping and hunting gear very helpful to consumers. “If Yeti can't stand behind the NRA, I ain't standing behind Yeti no more,” Atkinson added in a Facebook post.
Yeti is disputing the NRA's claims that they've joined a boycott against pro-gun Americans. “Yeti notified the NRA Foundation, as well as a number of other organizations, that we were eliminating a group of outdated discounting programs,” the company wrote in a statement posted to Facebook. The outdoor lifestyle supplier added that they're offering business partners like the NRA alternative programs and called claims that Yeti was turning their backs on young gun owners untrue.
Several organizations including airlines and rental car companies have cut ties with the National Rifle Association in the wake of the deadly Parkland, Florida school shooting which killed 17 people in February. Since the shooting, many Americans have lashed out at the NRA for their stance on assault rifles and lobbying efforts against tighter gun laws.
Although Yeti says that their policy change on discounts is not related to the boycott, the decision was made less than two months after groups began to cut ties with the pro-gun group. Bank of America joined the movement in mid-April when the company announced that it would no longer lend money to companies which produce assault-style weapons for civilians.

It was a rough day for the already-roiled U.S. health insurance market: One giant merger was abandoned, another is threatened by infighting, and a major insurer announced it will stop selling coverage on public exchanges in 11 states.
Both merger deals had already been rejected by federal regulators and judges, but the companies were considering appeals to those decisions. Now they both appear to be off.
Aetna said it was abandoning its planned $34 billion purchase of Medicare Advantage provider Humana early Tuesday. Then, later in the day, Cigna said it is suing Anthem to kill a $48 billion acquisition bid.
The deals were conceived as a way to help the insurers increase their enrollment and cut down on expenses in part so they could improve their performances on the Affordable Care Act's public insurance exchanges. Big insurers have been hit with substantial losses from the exchanges, even though they represent a relatively small part of their overall business. Many have already cut back their offerings, and that has slashed customer choices in markets around the country.

The collapse of one deal and the uncertain future of the other could hurt shoppers on the exchanges next year by leaving them with even fewer options and potentially higher prices. Humana told investors late Tuesday that it was abandoning it exchanges in all 11 of its states as of the beginning of next year.
Humana, based in Louisville, Kentucky, was the only insurer on exchanges in 16 Tennessee counties, according to data compiled at the start of the 2017 open enrollment period by the Associated Press and health care consulting firm Avalere. That means customers in those counties may have no way to buy coverage with help from government tax credits next year unless another insurer decides to enter those markets.
Every exchange in the U.S. had at least one insurer selling coverage on it for 2017, according to Larry Levitt of the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health care issues.
Morningstar insurance analyst Vishnu Lekraj said it's possible all the four insurers involved in the deals could leave the exchanges.
Aetna Chairman and CEO Mark Bertolini raised that possibility months ago. They said that if their company's planned, was blocked, “we believe it is very likely that we would need to leave the public exchange business entirely,” according to court documents filed in that case.
Aetna, based in Hartford, Connecticut, says it lost $450 million last year on ACA-compliant coverage, while the company booked an overall profit of $2.27 billion. Its loss on ACA-compliant business was $100 million more than it expected.
Bertolini said recently that their company would announce by April 1 whether it will remain in any of its exchanges. “We're looking at everything,” they said.
Government and industry officials have said President Donald Trump's administration and congressional Republicans are weighing measures to stabilize the wobbly exchanges. Insurers have been pushing them to act soon.
“The clock is definitely ticking for the Trump administration to provide some clarity around what the rules will be,” Levitt said.
In suing to end its tie-up, Cigna, based in Bloomfield, Connecticut, said it wants more than $13 billion in damages from its onetime-companion Anthem, the Blue Cross-Blue Shield insurer, which is based in Indianapolis.
Cigna says it is seeking a $1.85 billion termination fee from Anthem and billions more in damages for what it says were Anthem's breaches of the merger agreement.
The insurer says the damages include the amount Cigna shareholders would have received if the merger had not failed. It noted that Anthem assumed full responsibility for litigation strategy and getting the necessary regulatory approvals, suggesting that it was Anthem's responsibility to push the deal through.
“Cigna fulfilled all of its contractual obligations and fully cooperated with Anthem throughout the approval process,” the insurer said in a statement.
An Anthem spokesperson says Cigna has no right to end the deal, and it remains committed to closing the transaction. The insurer had just filed on Monday paperwork to appeal the federal court ruling.
Anthem and Aetna put their acquisition bids together in 2015 and touted them as a way to grow enrollment and reap savings that they would then pass on to consumers.
The deal would have given Aetna the opportunity to significantly expand its presence in Medicare Advantage coverage, which involves privately run versions of the federal Medicare program for people who are over 65 or disabled.
But the Department of Justice had sued last summer to stop the deals, due to concerns about how they may affect prices and consumer choices. Federal judges then rejected the acquisitions in separate rulings filed earlier this year.
The deals would have combined four of the nations' five largest insurers. UnitedHealth Group is the largest.

The iconic Pont des Arts in Paris might be free of "love locks" but tourists are finding a new way of leaving their mark on the bridge over the Seine.
The bridge was finally cured of the long term scourge of love locks back in 2015, when the City Hall replaced the railings with glass panels.
But it seems one remedy has provoked another ailment, with some tourists so desperate to leave a sign of their love that have switched from the padlock to the pen.
Recent pictures posted on the Facebook page of the No Love Locks campaign group showed how couples were leaving messages and hearts on the perspex panels.
Lisa Anselmo, Co-founder, No Love Locks told The Local: “The tagging of the Pont des Arts just makes more obvious what we've been saying all along: this is about willful destruction of historic places, and a disrespect for Parisians. Locks or pens, it's the same sickness: ego."
The pictures, which included one couple being caught in the act, sparked anger with many commenters slamming the tourists as "vandals".
"Would people do this in their home town/city? What makes them think it's OK just because they are away from home? An on-the-spot fine should be introduced," wrote one angry commenter.
Another wrote: "Really cannot believe the disgusting disgraceful behaviour of some people .... go away and vandalise your own town or city."
Others pointed the finger at the police and Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo.
"What is wrong with the police? They can't spare one officer to patrol that beautiful bridge and prevent this?," said one.
"Mayor Hidalgo still too busy making short term apartment rentals illegal to actually take care of their city? Almost glad we never got to the Pont des Arts this visit because this would've made me insane," added another.
The glass panels were placed on the bridge in 2015 after City Hall were finally forced to act after part of the railings collapsed under the sheer weight of the love locks.
Although they are regularly cleaned, the hefty bill is one the Town Hall could do without.
While Pont des Arts may be free of the scourge of love locks, the nearby Leopold-Sedar-Senghor footbridge is still blighted by padlocks.
City Hall has put up signs warning tourists not to place love locks on the bridge but it appears to have had little impact.

Linebacker Christian Kirksey said a different vibe exists with the Cleveland Browns this year.
Perhaps that's why Kirksey boldly posted on social media last month that the Browns would make the playoffs this season. For the record, Cleveland hasn't made the playoffs since 2002 and owns a 1-31 mark over the last two years -- including a 0-16 season in 2017.
"Being one of the longest tenured players on the team, I've seen the teams come through Cleveland," the 25-year-old Kirksey told NFL Network on Tuesday. "I'm going on to my second head coach, my third general manager, my third defensive coordinator, so I've seen players and front office people come in and out the building, and this is just a different feel."
Kirksey declared that optimism exists based on the leadership and competitiveness of quarterback Tyrod Taylor. The 28-year-old guided Buffalo to the postseason for the first time since 1999 after completing 62.6 percent of their passes for 2,799 yards and 14 touchdowns with four interceptions in 2017.
"He's our guy to take the field and finally have a competitive attitude on the offensive side of the ball," Kirksey said of Taylor, who was acquired for a third-round pick. "Jarvis Landry, Josh Gordon, all those guys just have a swagger about themselves. In all my years I've never had that on the offensive side of the ball. Those guys are telling us, 'We're working today.'"
Kirksey was also encouraged by cornerback Denzel Ward, who the Browns selected out of Ohio State with the fourth overall pick of the 2018 NFL Draft.
"Just seeing them on the practice field, he's like a silent assassin," Kirksey said of Ward. "He doesn't say too much, but when he's on the field their play is lock. Him being a lockdown corner like I see will give Myles Garrett an extra step to the quarterback."
Kirksey is coming off their second straight strong season, recording 138 tackles, 3.5 sacks, two forced fumbles and one fumble recovery in 16 games.
The White House signalled a sharp break with decades of support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict Tuesday, on the eve of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the White House.
A senior White House official said the United States would no longer seek to dictate the terms of any eventual peace settlement, but would support what the two sides agree to together.
“A two-state solution that doesn't bring peace is not a goal that anybody wants to achieve,” the official said on condition of anonymity.
“Peace is the goal, whether that comes in the form of a two-state solution if that's what the parties want, or something else if that's what the parties want. That's going to be up to them, we are not going to dictate what the terms of peace are going to be,” said the official.
President Trump hosts Netanyahu at the White House on Wednesday, and is expected to express their desire to help broker a solution to the conflict. They have already tapped son-in-law Jared Kushner and lawyer Jason Greenblatt to lead their peace drive.
But major questions remain about how Trump will achieve that goal. For the better part of half a century, successive US governments — both Republican and Democrat — have backed a two-state solution. It was the basis of peace talks at Oslo and Camp David.
But since coming to office in late January, Trump has sought to show that the United States is an unwavering ally of Israel and tried to draw a contrast with the policies of President Barack Obama.
Netanyahu won re-election in 2015 by insisting they would not accept the creation of a Palestinian state, a vow that considerably soured relations with the Obama White House.
Obama often warned that Israeli settlement construction could make a two-state solution impossible, and that a one state solution would put the future of the Jewish state in question. Trump has shied away from criticising Netanyahu's settlement policies as an impediment to peace, instead offering Israel some scope to build on land already under development.
“The construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal,” the White House said in a statement earlier this month.
Saeb Erakat, a senior Palestinian official, said it was not enough for Trump to say settlements were “unhelpful” but they must order an end to new building.
Netanyahu arrived in Washington on Monday, dined with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday and after their White House talks with Trump on Wednesday will meet lawmakers.
Aside from winning support for policies that will help them at home, the Israeli leader will also want to get the measure of Trump's appetite for better relations with Russia.
Trump has signalled their willingness to work with Russia to defeat the Daesh group in Syria. That could de facto mean furthering the goals of Russian allies Bashar Assad and Iran.
Israel sees Iran and its Lebanese ally the Hezbollah militia as its greatest existential threat, a view shared by the leaders of the main Sunni Arab states of the region.
Dennis Ross, a US diplomat who worked on Middle East policy under both Republican and Democratic administrations, said Netanyahu's diplomatic goals would at first be modest.
Israel wouldn't oppose a rapprochement with Moscow in itself, but would urge Washington to use this as leverage to push Russia away from Iran.
“What he'd like to see is a distancing of Russia from Iran within Syria, maybe more of a move toward Turkey and less toward Iran in Syria,” Ross told reporters on Monday.
Trump appears to have back-pedalled on a campaign threat to tear up Obama's Iran nuclear deal, which Israel bitterly opposed, but their administration has “put Iran on notice.”
This appears to mean a more robust stance against military provocations and a determination to impose tough sanctions on Iran's missile program and covert support for militants.
Observers expect Trump and Netanyahu to get on well in public. Both have much to gain politically from marking a clean break from the Obama years.
But, personal chemistry aside, the pair will only make the relationship a success if it overcomes the disagreement that poisoned ties under Obama.
The aseptic packaging market experiences growth due to rise in demand for the packaging solution from multiple sectors and the developing regions. Demand for convenience and packaged products is steadily on the rise as the increase in urban population and demand from the food and beverage industry has spiked demand for aseptic packaging solutions.
The packaging primarily involves keeping food safe, fresh, and flavorful for at least six months without refrigeration or preservatives. It allows food to retain more color, texture, taste, and nutrition. The process destroys and microorganisms that would otherwise contaminate the food, help keep it fresh for longer periods of time.
Pre-filled syringes are expected to be the fastest growing market, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.7% during the forecast period. The development of aseptic technologies in the pharmaceutical market has helped to improve the safety standards and logistical support. The sector is expected to contribute to the growth of aseptic packaging in the developing regions where the presence of pharmaceutical companies is expected to grow.
In terms of materials, the use of paper is estimated to achieve significant growth over the forecast period with an expected CAGR of 9.5%. The use of paper products is backed by concerns over ecological and sustainable packaging practices. Development in alternative sources of deriving paper products and enhancing their strength has resulted in increasing demand for the material. The use of plastics is widely being condemned by governments, which may result in a gradual decline in the use of plastic materials over the years.
Asia-Pacific is expected to be the fastest growing region for aseptic packaging globally. The developing countries of India, China, and Japan have large populations with rise in middle class and large-scale urbanization. The demand for packaged food and beverage is on the rise as the consumer awareness towards food safety and packaging is expected to influence the growth. The increased presence of pharmaceutical companies in the region and their export commitment to other regions such as Europe and North America has prompted them to adopt aseptic packaging to comply with regulations.

The major companies in the aseptic packaging market include Amcor, Robert Bosch, Tetra Laval, Bemis, DuPont, Reynolds Group, Greatview Aseptic Packaging, and Schott AG.
The National Rifle Association took a shot at YETI coolers and created a stir. Now the company that markets a line of fashionable and expensive products has fired back.
On April 20, the NRA sent a letter to its members saying that YETI coolers had cut ties with the organization.
With a day to let the smoke settle, literally in some cases, YETI responded to the NRA's claims.
In a post on Twitter, the company said that a few weeks ago it notified the NRA Foundation and other organizations that it was “eliminating a group of outdated discounting programs.”

“When we notified the NRA Foundation and the other organizations about this change, YETI explained that we were offering them an alternative customization program broadly available to consumers and organizations, including the NRA Foundation,” the statement read. “These facts directly contradict the inaccurate statement the NRA-ILA distributed on April 20.”
The NRA letter said "YETI has declined to do business with The NRA Foundation saying they no longer wish to be an NRA vendor, and refused to say why. They will only say they will no longer sell products to The NRA Foundation.”
Some NRA supporters responded to the news by planning a boycott of the popular line of coolers and other products, including apparel. One South Carolina man took their anger with YETI a step further.
Bryan Atkinson filled their YETI cooler with explosives, placed it in a field, then shot it with their AR-15 rifle.
Copycats followed Atkinson's lead, and the hashtag #YetiCoolerChallenge has been trending. Many people made social media posts where they got creative in the ways they destroyed their YETI products, the Washington Post reported.
The dispute between the NRA and YETI comes after a number of businesses have distanced themselves from the NRA or gun manufacturers following several high-profile shootings.
Companies ranging from airlines to rental car companies ended discounts for NRA members, the Chicago Tribune reported.
Some NRA members have taken to social media to dispute YETI's statement, with it being called damage control. But YETI has said it remains a strong supporter of the the Second Amendment.
"YETI is unwavering in our belief in and commitment to the Constitution of the United States and its Second Amendment," the company tweeted.

© Sputnik/ Grigoriy Sisoev Turkey Says Syrian Opposition Intends to Participate in Next Astana Talks - Lavrov
ASTANA (Sputnik) – It is critically important for Kazakhstan to increase the number of observers of Astana process on Syrian reconciliation with the issue being actively discussed with guarantor states, Kazakh Foreign Minister Kairat Abdrakhmanov told reporters on Tuesday.
“It is critically important for us to increase the number of observers, Kazakhstan's party is actively working on the issue with the guarantor states so that all parties interested in boosting the cessation of hostilities regime have an opportunity to observe Astana process. We raised an issue of the possibility to involve Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar during talks with guarantor states such as Russia. On the other hand, we are very interested in informing the European Union about the course of Astana process,” Abdrakhmanov said.
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Namibian media say an elephant trampled and killed an Argentine who was in a group of hunters tracking a herd of elephants.
The Namibia Press Agency said the hunter, identified as 46-year-old Jose Monzalvez, was killed on Saturday afternoon in a private wildlife area 70 kilometers (43 miles) northwest of the small town of Kalkfeld.
The agency said Monzalvez, who worked for an oil company, was with another Argentine and three Namibians when they were killed. It says one of the elephants charged before the group was able to find a spot to aim and shoot.
The report says Monzalvez had a hunting permit with them and that relatives have been informed of their death.

PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — The colorful and lively Rose Parade has proceeded safely today under cloudy skies — and the watchful eyes of more than 1,000 law enforcement officers.
No major problems were reported after security and other safety measures were beefed up. A large law enforcement presence was also seen at the nearby Rose Bowl, for the game between USC and Penn State.
Officials say there were no known threats toward Pasadena. But in addition to uniformed and plainclothes officers, additional security measures were taken. Sturdy barricades were erected at more than 50 intersections to prevent a terrorist attack like ones that happened in Germany and France last year when trucks barreled into crowds of people.
The 5½-mile parade featured marching bands, horseback riders and dozens of ornately decorated floats covered with flowers.
Highlights included a Hawaii-themed float with a volcano and several waterfalls, another with surfing dogs and one honoring the 49 people killed in the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida.

DETROIT (AP) - The mother of a G League basketball player who died in March after collapsing on the court during a game has filed a federal lawsuit accusing the NBA and the Detroit Pistons of negligence.
Zeke Upshaw played for the Grand Rapids Drive, a G League affiliate of the Pistons. They collapsed during a game at Grand Rapids on March 24 and died two days later .
The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The NBA and Pistons are named as defendants, along with SSJ Group and The DeltaPlex Arena. Jewel Upshaw, the player's mother, is the plaintiff, both individually and on behalf of Zeke Upshaw's estate.
The lawsuit alleges that medical personnel at the game failed to attempt lifesaving measures in a timely fashion.
"Remarkably, for much longer than four full minutes, no cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated, no chest compressions were started, no oxygen mask was placed on their nose and mouth, no airway was cleared and secured, and no defibrillator sensors and electric delivery patches were attached and secured to Zeke's chest," the suit says.
The suit also says the defendants failed to provide the G League team "the resources, policies, and procedures reasonably necessary" to prevent or handle Upshaw's collapse.
The NBA, the Pistons and the Drive did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.
Upshaw started their college basketball career at Illinois State. They graduated with a degree in apparel, merchandising and design. The Chicago native then transferred to Hofstra, where they played in 2013-14. Upshaw was undrafted and played internationally in Slovenia and Luxembourg. They spent most of the last two seasons with the Drive.

Former Baywatch actor Jeremy Jackson is behind bars after accepting a plea deal for allegedly stabbing a woman in Los Angeles during a 2015 argument over a car, PEOPLE confirms.
On Feb. 22, the 36-year-old actor pleaded no contest to one felony count of assault with a deadly weapon, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office confirms to PEOPLE. (A no-contest plea is functionally identical to a guilty plea, though the defendant does not admit guilt to the charges.)
On March 2, Jackson was sentenced to 270 days in the L.A. County Jail and placed on five years' probation, according to the L.A. County Sheriff's Department. They were jailed the same day, records show.
Without the plea deal, Jackson faced seven years in prison if found guilty.
 They are expected to be released on May 16, according to court records. Neither their attorney nor their rep immediately responded to requests for comment.

Prosecutors say Jackson's plea is in connection with an Aug. 6, 2015, arrest. They were accused of allegedly stabbing a woman in L.A. after getting into an argument with them about their boyfriend's car.
They pleaded not guilty to the charge at the time.
Jackson starred in Baywatch from 1991 to 1999 and more recently appeared on Celebrity Rehab and U.K. Celebrity Big Brother.
PARIS (AP) — Several U.S.-based climate scientists are about to hit the jackpot, as French President Emmanuel Macron prepares to award them multi-year, all-expenses-paid grants to relocate to France.
The “Make Our Planet Great Again” grants are part of Macron's efforts to counter U.S. President Donald Trump on the climate change front. Macron announced a competition for the projects in June, hours after Trump declared they would withdraw the U.S. from the global accord reached in Paris in 2015 to reduce climate-damaging emissions.
Macron is unveiling the first winners Monday evening at a startup incubator in Paris called Station F, where Microsoft and smaller tech companies are announcing projects to finance activities aimed at reducing emissions.
Monday's event is a prelude to a bigger climate summit Tuesday aimed at giving new impetus to the Paris accord and finding new funding to help governments and businesses meet its goals.

More than 50 world leaders are expected in Paris for the “One Planet Summit,” co-hosted by the U.N. and the World Bank. Trump was not invited.
Initially aimed at American researchers, the research grants were expanded to other non-French climate scientists, according to organizers. Candidates need to be known for working on climate issues, have completed a thesis and propose a project that would take between three to five years.
The time frame would cover Trump's current presidential term.
The applicant list was whittled down to 90 finalists in September, the majority of them Americans or based in the U.S., according to French national research agency CNRS.
About 50 projects will be chosen overall, and funded with 60 million euros ($70 million) from the state and French research institutes.
Some French researchers have complained that Macron is showering money on foreign scientists at a time when they have been pleading for more support for domestic higher education.
NEW YORK (AP) — Dick Clark Productions is hitting back against Mariah Carey's claim it sabotaged their live performance on its “New Year's Rockin' Eve” special.
Carey's disaster during the annual New Year's Eve special made international headlines: The superstar vocally stumbled through their short set in Times Square, failing to sing for most of it despite a pre-recorded track of their songs playing in the background.
Carey was visibly upset during the performance and afterward tweeted “(expletive) happens.”
Carey representative Nicole Perna blames technical difficulties. In an interview with Billboard they said Dick Clark Productions hampered Carey's performance and “set them up to fail.”

The production company calls such claims “absurd.”
COLUMBUS, Ga. – One non-profit hopes to honor the efforts of a select number of local military servicemen. The Georgia Military Veterans Hall of Fame will induct 13 servicemen with ties to Columbus in November. The non-profit looks at three categories for applicants, including valor, service and achievement.
Monday, Columbus Mayor Teresa Tomlinson recognized a few of the inductees whose service spans from World War II to Korea to Vietnam, to name a few. They presented them with a resolution that recognizes their achievements and their service to the community.
“So many of them have continued on to serve in our community, and that's what makes our veterans in this community so great,” the mayor said. “When they retire here, they keep giving. They continue on in that service.”
Jonnie Melillo Clasen's father Vincent is being posthumously honored with a Hall of Fame nod. The World War II veteran conducted dangerous missions in the Chinese-Burma theater during the war.
“He was out there representing Merrill's Marauders and the Rangers all over the state. They were like the Energizer Bunny,” Clasen said. “If my dad had been alive, they would have said ‘they're only doing this because I'm old.' It's very special because it's another way of keeping their memory alive.”
“To be apart of this is to be apart of something greater and that will go on for years to identify those heroes that live right here in our own community,” retired Sgt. Maj. Judson Gee said.
Gee is an honorary member of the Georgia Military Veterans Hall of Fame board.
“Real life heroes are the ones that lay their lives on the line to protect our liberties here in the United States,” Gee said. “They're right here in their own backyard, and they don't even know it.”
The induction ceremony is scheduled for Nov. 4. Anyone who wants to nominate a veteran, click here. There are two weeks left to nominate a veteran.
“About 1% of Americans actually serve in the military anymore,” GMV HOF founder Paul Longgrear said. “And if we ever lose the military, we'll lose the rights that we have.”

President Donald Trump complained about chief White House strategist Steve Bannon at a private dinner with 21st Century Fox mogul Rupert Murdoch, the New York Times reported on Monday.
The New York Times reported, citing an unnamed source familiar with their conversation, that Murdoch urged Trump to get rid of Bannon, and that the President offered little protest, instead venting about their chief strategist.
According to the report, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner and their newly minted chief of staff John Kelly also attended Trump's and Murdoch's dinner at the White House before the President left for a “working vacation” early in August.
CNN reported on Sunday, citing two unnamed sources with direct knowledge, that Trump and Murdoch had a private dinner at the White House a day after the end of Anthony Scaramucci's whirlwind tenure as Trump's communications director.
The New York Times also cited a dozen unnamed “current and former Trump aides and associates with knowledge of the situation” who said Kelly made their displeasure with Bannon clear and told top White House staffers they would not tolerate Bannon's behind-the-scenes maneuvering.
Scaramucci on Sunday said Bannon's influence was “not serving the President's interests.”
“I think the President knows what he's going to do with Steve Bannon,” Scaramucci said cryptically, and declined to clarify beyond adding, “It's their decision, but I mean, at the end of the day I think the President has a very good idea of whom the leakers are inside the White House.”
National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster ducked multiple questions about whether they would be willing to work with Bannon, saying only, “I believe that everyone who works in the White House, who has the privilege, the great privilege every day of serving their nation, should be motivated by that goal.”

PARIS (AP) - The squat glass bottles held the urine of sport's greatest stars and helped confound its cheating scoundrels. The "click, click" of their locking caps being firmly screwed on was a familiar sound to athletes around the world, on early mornings when sample collectors knocked on their doors and at doping control stations at the Olympic Games, World Cups and other major events.
But now, after two decades of behind-the-scenes service to the cause of clean sport, Berlinger bottles are joining the list of victims of Russian skullduggery.
The Swiss company's announcement this month that it will no longer manufacture the bottles used for the vast bulk of the 300,000 drug tests conducted annually in global sports has shocked the anti-doping community and set off a scramble to source replacements, because without trustworthy bottles, there can be no trustworthy tests.
Berlinger's withdrawal from the niche market it dominated isn't entirely surprising.
By finding ways to sneakily uncap Berlinger bottles, so Russian cheats' dirty samples could be swapped out with clean urine at the Sochi Olympics in 2014 and other competitions, Russian secret service agents wrecked faith in a product that had, until then, been anti-doping's Fort Knox and damaged the reputation of the small, 153-year-old family-run Swiss company that prides itself on quality and reliability (staff motto: "You can count on me!")
The key role FSB agents played in sport's biggest recent doping scandal was documented in probes led by Canadian doping investigator Richard McLaren for the World Anti-Doping Agency. Whistleblowing Russian former lab director Grigory Rodchenkov said FSB tools for unpicking the bottles' security locks looked similar to the thin metal instruments used in dentistry. FSB agents' tampering left small tell-tale markings later spotted by forensic scientists, helping to prove that the supposedly secure bottles had been opened.
"When a major power uses its secret services, its technicians, and all of its considerable scientific resources to find a way to cheat material that until then was reliable it's hard for a company to resist such firepower," says Mathieu Teoran, general secretary of the French anti-doping agency. "I can't cast stones at Berlinger because Russian secret services managed to open their products."
Berlinger rolled out a new generation of bottles with additional security features last year. But it then suffered another setback when WADA announced shortly before the Winter Olympics this February in South Korea that the new bottles appeared to be flawed and that some could be opened manually without leaving evidence.
Berlinger rushed replacement bottles, based on an earlier model, to the IOC for use at the games. But that episode, plus other recent cases of bottles cracking when frozen, proved to be final straws. Production of Berlinger anti-doping kits, first used internationally at the soccer World Cup in 1998 and at every Olympics since 2000, has ceased. The company plans to concentrate instead on its production of cold-chain temperature monitors for the storage and transport industries.
"The focus on these anti-doping bottles got so big," says Berlinger spokesperson Hans Klaus. "If everybody is just finger-pointing at Berlinger if there is a doping case you get - how shall I say? - a reputation which is not only bad but a reputation which is ambivalent, so it's not good for the whole business."
Because its bottles were used for about 80-90 percent of tests, the market leader's departure leaves a void that could be catastrophic for anti-doping if not quickly filled. Berlinger's remaining stock of less than 100,000 bottles should be able to keep the system going "for three to five months," including the World Cup in Russia, Klaus says. The urgent task of sourcing replacements will be one of the hottest topics at a meeting of anti-doping leaders in Lausanne, Switzerland, this week.
"One of the lessons from this is that the heavy reliance on a single manufacturer has proven to be a problem," says Graeme Steel, CEO of the iNADO umbrella group of anti-doping organizations. Berlinger was the "gold standard" and "a huge hole that we have to fill."
Several would-be replacements are gathering in the wings. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency says it is working with Major League Baseball on a new range of tamper-resistant urine sample containers scheduled for release in months. There's a new research project in Sweden, too.
Best placed might be Versapak, a lesser-known British company that already makes doping control products. It says it is working with WADA and Britain's anti-doping agency on a new kit for transporting urine samples, with a launch delayed to later this month.
Either way, Berlinger and Russia's role in its departure won't be quickly forgotten.
"They were really very much part of the anti-doping community," says Steel. "They are collateral damage of that Russian doping program."

The ex-chairperson of an influential Parliamentary health watchdog has condemned the cost of a controversial PFI contract signed by Yorkshire hospital bosses as “nothing short of scandalous” after it emerged the region's trusts are paying out £112m a year on similar funding deals.
David Hinchliffe, a former Wakefield MP who chaired the health select committee in the period when the use of ‘buy now, pay later' deals became widespread under New Labour, said cash-strapped hospital bosses and local politicians should have done more to renegotiate their annual payments.

The Yorkshire Post says: PFI - Value for money or not?
Hospital trust pays extra £40m to end its ‘ruinous' PFI contract
Trust with £1bn PFI scheme could sign another deal
Analysis by The Yorkshire Post reveals that five Yorkshire hospital trusts have signed PFI (Private Finance Initiative) deals, where private firms fund the upfront costs of new buildings and are paid back over several decades, at a cost of £3.8bn. These include Mid Yorkshire hospital trust, which will pay £1.61bn over 35 years, including £38.9m last year, as part of the contract for Pontefract and Pinderfields Hospitals.
On this scheme and many others the NHS is being taken for a ride by the PFI companies. David Hinchliffe
And Leeds' hospital trust, one of the largest in the country, says it is considering using a PFI scheme to pay for new buildings more than a decade after signing a similar deal which will cost more than £1bn over 30 years.
A total of £111.5m was paid out last year to service these debts, for buildings with a capital value of £752.6m. In addition, four Yorkshire mental health trusts have PFI contracts worth £747.7m.
The costs pile extra pressure on NHS bosses at a time when services are under unprecedented stress. Mr Hinchliffe, who says their criticisms of PFI in a select committee report were watered down by ‘loyalist' Labour MPs, said the cost of the Pinderfields scheme was “nothing short of scandalous”.
They said: “On this scheme and many others the NHS is being taken for a ride by the PFI companies and it concerns me deeply that the education sector, now using PFI for school projects, has not learned any lessons from the NHS.
“I have sympathy for those NHS Trusts - such as Mid Yorkshire - which have the albatross of PFI around their necks but, in my view, there should have been much more vigorous efforts by them and local MPs to press nationally for a renegotiation of the debt repayment arrangements.”
Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust insists the PFI scheme represents good value for money despite significant annual costs and is saving £20m a year compared with the old hospital buildings it helped replace.
Martin Barkley, chief executive at Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: “The PFI scheme was approved on the basis that it represents good value for money. The fact it does represent good value for money does not mean the cost of the investment year-on-year is not insignificant.”

President Donald Trump will dispatch their top diplomatic and military advisors to Pakistan in the coming weeks, turning up the heat on a nuclear-armed ally accused of harbouring terror groups.
Weeks after Trump angrily accused Islamabad of providing safe haven to “agents of chaos,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson plans to depart for Pakistan late this month.
They will be followed by Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, according to US and Pakistani sources.
The one-two punch is designed to drill home Trump's message that Pakistani state support for jihadist groups has to end, according to officials briefed on the visits.
Washington has long been frustrated by Pakistan's willingness to offer cross-border safe havens to Taliban factions and armed jihadist groups fighting US troops and their Afghan allies.
The relationship reached the breaking point in 2011 when former president Barack Obama sent commandos into Pakistan in 2011 to kill Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who was living in a military garrison town.
With little change since then, Trump came to office indicating that Washington's frustration had reached the point where something had to give.
“We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting,” they said in an August address.
But in the six weeks since Trump signalled that tougher tone, there have been precious few signs that the calculus in South Asia has changed.
Mattis told Congress this week that they will try “one more time” to “see if we can make this work.”
– ‘Not acceptable' –
“To this point, we have not seen any impact on military-to-military relations,” said one Pentagon official, suggesting any change would not happen after Mattis's visit.
Visiting Washington, Pakistan's foreign minister Khawaja Asif appeared unwavering.
They lashed out at “hollow allegations” about Pakistan harbouring terrorists as “not acceptable.”
“That is not the way you talk to 70-year-old friends,” Asif said bitterly.
“Instead of accusations and threats we should cooperate with each other for the peace in the region,” they added in confirming Tillerson's visit.
While professing anger in public, Pakistani officials in private complain about receiving no concrete requests to target the Haqqani network or other groups.
US officials have been reticent to share some intelligence for fear of tipping off targets with links inside Pakistan's government.
Earlier this month, a US drone killed three suspected militants in an attack on a compound in Pakistan's tribal region.
Pakistani officials also complain of receiving mixed messages from the Trump administration, which is still struggling to find its feet under a mercurial commander-in-chief.
A September meeting in New York between Vice President Mike Pence and Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi was said to be cordial, despite Trump's fire and brimstone rhetoric.
“It was a very good meeting with the vice president,” said Asif.
After that, Pakistan officials said, they were surprised at a tougher tone outlined in public by Mattis and in private by Trump's National Security Advisor HR McMaster.
– ‘Call Pakistan's bluff' –
Some optimists point to a visit by Pakistan's army chief to Kabul as evidence that Islamabad is moderating, after years of support propping up the Taliban.
But many, having watched this debate for decades, are less convinced.
The Taliban and groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba, they argue, remain a potent tool in the hands of Pakistani intelligence.
“Of course they don't get the message,” said Christine Fair, a South Asia expert at Georgetown University.
“Pakistan is not going to do anything different than its already doing unless the administration can figure out a way to do what no administration has previously done.”
“That is basically to call Pakistan's bluff and impose some meaningful punishment.”
Trump has warned that military aid — which was halved between 2012 and 2016 — could be cut further, a move that Fair dismisses as insufficient.
“It's basically saying that we're going to cut back the money the US taxpayer is giving to Pakistan,” they said.
“That's not punishment. Pakistan is not entitled to our money. What they are really talking about is giving Pakistan less of an allowance.”
Policymakers have considered revoking Pakistan's non-NATO ally status, with deep symbolic but limited practical impact.
Punitive economic sanctions — that could force Pakistan closer to China, Russia or Turkey — seem a long way off.
And Pakistan remains vital for the United States as a route to resupply its forces in Afghanistan and for supplying the Afghan army.

Vacation With Your Valentine: America's Most Romantic RetreatsAn introduction to five of America's best romantic retreats to celebrate Valentine's Day
WASHINGTON (AP) — Just 24 percent of Americans believe the country is heading in the right direction after a tumultuous stretch for President Donald Trump that included the threat of war with North Korea, stormy complaints about hurricane relief and Trump's equivocating about white supremacists. That's a 10-point drop since June, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
The decline in optimism about the nation's trajectory is particularly pronounced among Republicans. In June, 60 percent of Republicans said the country was headed in the right direction; now it's just 44 percent.
The broader picture for the president is grim, too. Nearly 70 percent of Americans say Trump isn't level-headed, and majorities say he's not honest or a strong leader. More than 60 percent disapprove of how they are handling race relations, foreign policy and immigration, among other issues.
Overall, 67 percent of Americans disapprove of the job Trump is doing in office, including about one-third of Republicans.
Tracy Huelsman, a 40-year-old from Louisville, Kentucky, is among them. A self-described moderate Republican, Huelsman said she's particularly concerned about the “divisiveness” they feel the president promotes on social media.
“It's scary in 2017 that we are in what seems like a worse place in terms of division,” said Huelsman, who did not vote for Trump in last year's election.
The assessments come after a turbulent summer for Trump that included a major White House shake-up, bringing the departure of their chief of staff, top strategist and press secretary. While the installment of retired Marine Gen. John Kelly as chief of staff has ushered in more day-to-day order in the West Wing, the president has still stirred up numerous controversies, including when they blamed “both sides” for the clashes between white supremacists and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Trump has also raised the specter of a military conflict with North Korea over its nuclear provocations. He's derided North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, as “rocket man,” including during a speech at the United Nations, and has downplayed the prospects that diplomatic negotiations with Kim could yield results.
Despite their electoral success, Trump struggled as both a candidate and now as president to broaden their base of support beyond their ardent supporters. The loyalty of their core backers has been enough to keep Republican lawmakers largely in line, but party operatives are closely watching Trump's support among GOP and independent voters ahead of next year's midterm elections, when the balance of power in Congress will be at stake.
To be sure, lawmakers have their own problems to worry about. Americans have even less esteem for Congress than Trump, with just 18 percent saying they approve of the job being done by the House and the Senate.
Republicans took another hit last month when they failed — for a second time this year — to pass an overhaul of the nation's health care law. GOP leaders tried to rush votes on the complicated legislation, leaving many voters unsure of what was in the package.
“They never seemed to present a bill to people that you could actually look at the details of and the pluses and minuses of it,” said Dennis Cronin, a 67-year-old independent from Wenham, Massachusetts.
The GOP failure on health care has irritated Trump, who promised voters that repealing “Obamacare” would be easy. Americans aren't happy with their progress on health care either; 68 percent disapprove of their handling of the issue.
Of all the issues surveyed by the AP-NORC poll, the president performs slightly better on the economy. But even there, 56 percent disapprove of the job he's doing and just 42 percent say they approve.
On Friday, the Labor Department announced that the U.S. shed 33,000 jobs in September because of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which closed thousands of businesses in Texas and Florida and forced widespread evacuations. It marked the first monthly hiring drop in nearly seven years.
Ninety-two percent of Democrats and 69 percent of independents say Trump understands the problems of people like them not very or not at all well. Even among Republicans, only 42 percent say they understand them very well, while 32 percent say they do moderately well.
The AP-NORC poll of 1,150 adults was conducted Sept. 28-Oct. 2 using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.
Respondents were first selected randomly using address-based sampling methods, and later interviewed online or by phone.

Some fan-favorite DC properties are making their long-awaited returns in 2018. At NYCC this week, DC shed light on their plans for the upcoming relaunch of the Milestone imprint and revealed that another Alan Moore-created property is being integrated into the DC Universe.
The revived Milestone imprint is being dubbed "Earth M." Earth M will feature a rebooted take on Dakota Universe characters like Static Shock, Icon and Rocket and take place on its own world in the larger DC multiverse. The line will kick off in spring 2018 with the ongoing series Milestone, from co-writers Reginald Hudlin (Black Panther) and Denys Cowan (Star Wars: Mace Windu) and artist Ken Lashley (X-Men Gold). Similar to The Wild Storm, Milestone will set the stage for the larger Earth M universe and the other books united under the Earth M banner.

DC revealed four other titles that will spin out of Milestone. Hudlin and artist Kyle Baker (Plastic Man) will relaunch Static Shock. Greg Pak (Totally Awesome Hulk) will write a miniseries called Duo, which focuses on two characters cursed to inhabit the same body for eternity. Hudlin and artist Ryan Benjamin (Odyssey of the Amazons) will craft a miniseries called Love Army, featuring a secret army of super-strong women. And Earth M, from co-writers Hudlin and Alice Randall (The Wind Done Gone) and artists Cowan and Bill Sienkiewicz (Elektra: Assassin) will focus on a new vigilante character.
“We know fans have been waiting for the return of Milestone Media and we're excited to collaborate with Reggie and Denys to build this new Earth M universe,” said DC Co-Publisher Jim Lee. “This world will reintroduce iconic characters fans know and love—along with new, bold, original concepts—creating a new platform dedicated to inclusion and great storytelling.”
In other unexpected news, DC revealed that Tom Strong fans can expect to see the character resurface in the near future. However, rather than announce a new Tom Strong miniseries DC announced that the adventuring scientist and their family are joining the cast of The Terrifics, the upcoming Dark Matter title from writer Jeff Lemire and artist Ivan Reis.
Tom Strong was created by Alan Moore and Chris Spouse in 1999 as part of the Wildstorm imprint America's Best Comics. The character was mostly recently seen in the 2013 miniseries Tom Strong and the Planet of Peril, but this will mark the first time he's appeared in the DCU proper.

While Americans are scrambling to meet the 2016 tax filing deadline, the number of illegal immigrants submitting their returns in the present climate are reportedly down significantly. Also, a Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) report exposing significant refund fraud has “most certainly contributed to it,” says the taxpayer advocate department within the IRS.
The Internal Revenue Service stated that millions of people who do not have Social Security numbers (SSN), most of these illegal aliens, filed federal tax returns last year, reported NPR the day before the tax deadline. Many of those who are ineligible for SSN use “ITIN,” or Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers when filing.
The Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent organization within the IRS, reports that “Without ITINs, approximately 4.6 million taxpayers would not be able to comply with their annual tax filing and payment obligations, or receive tax benefits to which they are legally entitled.”
The advocate service states that ITIN applications and “associated return filings” “have dropped precipitously, down 58 percent between 2011 and 2014.” They write that the “general economic climate and immigration trends” explain part of this drop, but the “IRS ITIN procedures have most certainly contributed to it.”
After the TIGTA report “alleging significant refund fraud connected to ITINS,” in 2012 the IRS made what its independent advocacy service calls “sweeping changes that require applicants to submit original identification documents (subject to a few alternatives).”
The IRS has also continued its policy of requiring applicants to apply for an ITIN with a paper tax return.
The new requirements led to delays for the ITIN applicants and associated large backlogs, the Taxpayer Advocate Services say. The independent arm charges that “While concerns about refund fraud are legitimate, the IRS's solutions do not effectively target the fraud nor do they balance the anti-fraud regime with the taxpayer's need for a process no more intrusive than necessary, part of a taxpayer's right to privacy.”
Moreover, NPR reported that tax preparers in the sanctuary city San Francisco area told them there is approximately a 20 percent decline in the number of people filing with ITIN numbers. A tax law professor at the University of Nevada said that tax preparers in other parts of the United States are making similar claims.
“Sending in a tax return with your current address and information is very unnerving to a population that wants to comply with the law and is actually leaving significant refunds on the table by not filing tax returns,” educator Francine Lipman said.
The IRS is barred from giving information it has obtained to other United States agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security. They may share information only under “limited circumstances” NPR reported. The professor says that those bearing ITIN numbers must decide “whether to trust that firewall.”
“Many of our clients are telling us that in years past they felt more hope and more of ability to have a pathway toward citizenship and lately there's a lot less hope,” Max Moy-Borgen, the head of a tax program at the Mission Economic Development Agency told NPR.

Calgary police have arrested a man after dozens of women were filmed without their knowledge and the images posted to a Twitter account called "Canada Creep."
Police say they received a complaint Monday about the account, which posted photos and videos, some shot up the skirts of unsuspecting women.
They say they identified a suspect thanks to a public tip and arrested a 42-year-old Calgary man on Tuesday afternoon.
Investigators are currently sifting through hundreds of thousands of images on numerous electronic devices that were seized and trying to identify victims.
Police say the suspect is currently in custody and is facing voyeurism-related charges in relation to three incidents.
But officers say the investigation is ongoing and more charges are anticipated.
They say their name will be released once charges are officially laid.
Police say the Twitter account had been up and running for about a year, but they hadn't received any complaints until this week.
The account, which had about 17,000 followers, was suspended Tuesday.
ST. ANDREWS, Scotland — Tommy Fleetwood broke the course record at Carnoustie by shooting 9-under 63 to tie for the lead with defending champion Tyrrell Hatton after two rounds of the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship on Friday.
Hatton also tamed the tough British Open venue, shooting 65 to move to 11 under par for the tournament. The English golfers were a stroke clear of Nicolas Colsaerts, and two ahead of Paul Dunne and Marcel Siem.
Playing their first event since becoming a father for the first time last week, Fleetwood birdied six of the last eight holes to complete a bogey-free round and beat the course record by a shot.
Carnoustie is regarded as the most difficult of the three courses that stage the tournament. Kingsbarns and the Old Course at St. Andrews are the others, with players alternating between the three in the first three rounds before playing at St. Andrews again for the final round.
Fleetwood holds a big lead in the Race to Dubai rankings despite playing in only one of the last seven tournaments on the European Tour. This season, they have won the Abu Dhabi Championship and the French Open, finished second at a World Golf Championship in Mexico, and placed fourth at the U.S. Open.
They have three top-five finishes at the Dunhill Links, which they say is one of their favourite events.
Hatton followed up a 68 at the Old Course with an even better round at Carnoustie, featuring birdies on four of the last six holes — including chipping in at the par-3 16th.
Winning the Dunhill Links, amid a strong finish to last season, helped lift Hatton to No. 14 in the world ranking. They made just two cuts in nine events from the Masters to the U.S. PGA Championship this year, but has back-to-back top 10s since.
Colsaerts has had consecutive 67s, at Kingsbarns then the Old Course.
Rory McIlroy shot a 71 at Carnoustie and was even par after two rounds. Eleven shots off the lead, McIlroy is likely to finish a season without a victory for just the second time in their pro career.
HARRISONBURG, Va. (AP) - A Virginia man who spent 18 days in transit between jails shackled in the back of a van on a charge that was ultimately dismissed is suing the company that conducted the transfer.
Edward Kovari of Stephens City was arrested in Virginia in September 2016 on charges in Texas alleging they had stolen a car.
According to a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in Harrisonburg, a private contractor botched Kovari's transfer from Virginia to Texas. Kovari says they spent 18 days in a van as it crisscrossed the country picking up and depositing inmates at a variety of jails.
The lawsuit alleges that the contractor, Prison Transportation Services, routinely subjects inmates to inordinately long trips to pick up as many inmates as possible.
The company didn't respond to requests for comment.
The man convicted of killing WA teenager Hayley Dodd has been described as a “demon” by the daughter of another potential victim, who has called on them to reveal anything they may know about their mother's disappearance.
Lily Parmenter's mum Katie O'Shea vanished in December 2005 from the north Queensland town of Atherton, which was 30km from where Wark was living at the time.
The West Australian revealed last week that detectives from Queensland had been in Perth attempting to interview Wark about the case, but they refused to speak with them.
“Words cannot describe how grateful I am that this demon is behind bars and unable to hurt anyone else,” Ms Parmenter said on Facebook yesterday.
“I feel sick to my stomach every time I think he's even been in the same area as my fantastic mother, let alone (could have) taken them life.”
The two-decade-long battle is still not over for Hayley's mother. The West Australian The two-decade-long battle is still not over for Hayley's mother.
Wark, 61, was sentenced in Perth on Tuesday to life in prison for murdering 17-year-old Hayley, who had been hitchhiking near their Badgingarra home in 1999.
They then killed them while attempting to subdue them so they could rape them
Ms Parmenter, who lives in Melbourne, has been closely watching the developments in Hayley's case and expressed sympathy to their family, who are desperate for Wark to reveal where they were buried.
“My heart goes out to Margaret Dodd and their family during this terrible time,” Ms Parmenter said.
“Every piece of information is crucial to both my family and the Dodds because our battles aren't over yet.”
When they were charged with Hayley's murder in 2015, Wark was already in jail in Queensland for abducting and brutally raping another young woman in 2007.
Wark was also called as a witness at an inquest into Ms O'Shea's death, held in Cairns in 2014, but denied having anything to do with their disappearance.

© REUTERS/ Carlos Barria Revenge of Neocons? Who Will Replace Michael Flynn and What It Tells Us
WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — The controversy surrounding Flynn began when someone leaked information that they were speaking to Russian officials and urging them not to overreact to the sanctions placed on them by the Obama administration — implying that the Trump administration may have a different position on Russia than their predecessor.
Flynn resigned after media reported based on leaked information that Flynn has misled Trump administration officials on the extent of their conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak focused on anti-Russia sanctions.
"Here's the bottom line, ladies and gentlemen," Mattis explained. "I'm brought in to be the secretary of defense and I give the president advice on the use of military force and frankly, this has no impact on what I'm heading there [to Europe] for."
Mattis pointed out that Flynn's departure from the Trump administration does not change the message at all.
"And who's on the president's staff is who I will work with," Mattis added.
In Europe, Mattis will attend the annual Munich Security Conference from February 17 to February 19 where they will hold meetings with defense ministers with other major nations from around the world.
Mattis plans to emphasize the continued commitment of the US government to the NATO alliance and to defeating Daesh.

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The sale of Merck KGaA's (MRCG.DE) consumer health unit has been thrown off track after Nestle (NESN.S) has pulled out, leaving the race to buy the maker of Seven Seas vitamins without its main contender, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Nestle has walked away from the process, led by JPMorgan (JPM.N), after months of negotiations as the Swiss company was put off by Merck's price expectations of about 4 billion euros (3.52 billion pounds), the sources said.
Nestle and Merck declined to comment. A spokesperson for Merck said that “the process of evaluating options for our consumer health business is well on track.”
Four sources familiar with the sale said that interest from other bidders, including British consumer goods giant Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L), was also waning as a rival consumer health auction, led by U.S. drug giant Pfizer (PFE.N), was gaining momentum.
Reckitt is now concentrating on buying the Pfizer unit which makes Advil painkillers, Centrum multivitamins and Chapstick lip balm and is worth about $20 billion, the sources said.
Reckitt declined to comment.
Germany's Merck said last year it was looking to sell its consumer healthcare business, which has annual sales of about $1 billion, to help to fund more research into prescription drugs.
Nestle was initially seen as a natural buyer for the business, which also makes Bion nutritional supplements, after previous talks to set up a consumer joint venture with Merck fell through over the summer.
Consumer health is a fragmented sector ranging from over-the-counter medicines and vitamins to sports nutrition products and condoms. It has proved fertile ground for deals in recent years, as aging populations and health-conscious consumers drive demand.
Nestle's CEO Mark Schneider is a healthcare veteran and wants a deeper focus on nutrition, health and wellness.
Nestle made a non-binding bid for the Merck's business in November and was then shortlisted to carry out due diligence and submit a final offer this year.
But the Swiss food group could not reach an agreement on price as Merck was targeting a valuation as high as 20 times the unit's core earnings, according to one of the sources.
Another source said mounting pressure from Dan Loeb's activist fund Third Point, which last year made a $3.5 billion investment in Nestle, also played a role in deciding against buying the Merck's business.
Loeb has repeatedly asked Nestle to move faster to overhaul its strategy. They want the Swiss company to boost its exposure in high-growth areas such as coffee, pet care, bottled water and nutrition while selling “ill-fitting businesses” more quickly.
Schneider has so far taken positive steps including selling the U.S. confectionery business to Italy's Ferrero for $2.8 billion but they want to be disciplined on price, the sources said.
Famous for their sharply-worded letters to corporate chieftains, Loeb wrote on Jan. 22 that they were concerned about Nestle pushing more deeply into consumer healthcare with the purchase of Canadian vitamin maker Atrium Innovations AIII.UL and said they want a better explanation of that move.
UPDATE 3-U.S. judge orders more environmental analysis of Dakota pipeline

HOUSTON - Honey bee experts say they uncovered a “bee village” Wednesday in the walls of an elderly woman's southwest Houston home.
The retired longtime HISD administrative assistant says they had the bees removed in the past but they have continued to return in the over 40 years they have lived in the home.
“I don't know what it is, but they've always kind of been around,” said homeowner Maude Mack.
Mack has been stung several times over the years when the bees have managed to get into their bedroom. They have been to the hospital multiple times this month and is in no shape to be stung again.
“They're right over this closet, here and kind of over the bedroom,” Mack said as they showed where the bees have been building their hive. “It's been a long, hard struggle.”
Walter Schumaker from the American Honey Bee Protection Agency in Austin drove to Mack's home Thursday to remove the bees.
Schumaker and their crew first use smoke to calm the bees and then begin removing the massive hive in sections.
The pieces of the hive are then reassembled on the ground and made ready for transport to an apiary in Pearland where the bees will be relocated.
Shumaker says residents may start finding more hives in their homes this year following Hurricane Harvey. They say major weather events destroy the homes of honey bees, just like humans, and they are forced to relocate, often finding shelter in houses and places where there are abandoned hives.
Mack says they are grateful for the help, but they are still skeptical their insect tenants will be gone for good.
“I think they can always find themselves a way to come back,” Mack said.

The elegance of the Townsman Chronograph Quartz FS5407 Men's Watch is its understated charm and occasional sharp views, coming from its slimmed-down case with no jagged corner to be felt.

This fine balance between classical elegance and techie-not-nerdy vibes straddles the fine line between dress and sports like an expert in a rodeo.

MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Somalia's security forces early Thursday morning ended a night-long siege by al-Shabab Islamic extremists at a popular Mogadishu restaurant.
Survivors of the attack were led by soldiers from the Pizza House restaurant building. The injured were taken by ambulances.
Soldiers surrounded the restaurant building and used guns mounted on the backs of vehicles to neutralize the militants. Troops entered the ground floor while the insurgent snipers held positions upstairs.
All five attackers were killed and after dawn the soldiers secured the building, said senior Somali police office Capt. Mohamed Hussein. The troops' efforts to take control of the Pizza House restaurant were slowed by the darkness of night, forcing them to wait until morning, said Hussein.

The roofs were blown off the Pizza House restaurant and nearby buildings from the powerful blasts.
High casualties are feared in the attack on the busy restaurant. The bodies of five girls thought to have been killed by the militants were found in the restaurant, said police. Inside the building, the body of a Syrian man who worked as a chef at restaurant lay near the rubble of a blood-spattered and bullet-marked wall.
JOHANNESBURG - A possible trade war between China and the United States could have negative economic consequences for the globe, but also offers opportunities for countries like South Africa in terms of the global food and agricultural value chain, Old Mutual said on Wednesday.
The possibility of such a war between the world's two largest economies has been in focus after US President Trump announced tariffs on Chinese goods and China retaliated with tariffs on mostly agricultural imports from the US.
Although this has created acute global uncertainty, astute South African investors should see this as an opportunity to invest in the global food and agriculture value chain, said Chris Potgieter, head of Old Mutual Wealth Private Client Securities.
"Right now, for example, China is threatening counter measures by increasing tariffs on 106 US agricultural exports, including soybeans, which will likely play out in a way that handicaps some agricultural players, while benefiting others," they said.
They singled out soybeans, noting that China was the second-largest market for US agricultural exports, of which the beans had historically been one of the top agricultural products.
"China's announcement to introduce duties on these exports will therefore negatively impact the American farming community who historically export soybeans to China, while American food producers who use soybeans as an input for manufacturing other foods downstream in the value chain will benefit from this," Potgieter said.
Winners with regard to this specific commodity would be countries such as South America, Australia and even South Africa, who were able to deliver soybeans to both the US and China.
"Given the current state of the global economic landscape, astute South African investors have the opportunity to invest in the various agricultural producers who stand to substitute production from either the US or China, as well as the broader food and agriculture value chain to the extent that food manufacturers can, in some instances, benefit from lower input prices," Potgieter said.

Efforts are on to make Sacred Games, an upcoming Netflix original series based in and shot in India, compelling enough to get the Indian audiences hooked to the medium, says filmmaker Vikramaditya Motwane, who is working behind-the-scenes on the show.
Based on Indian author Vikram Chandra's novel of the same name, it will feature Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan in the lead role to tell the story of the intricate web of organized crime, corruption, politics, and espionage that lie beneath India's economic renaissance.
Asked if the series will be like a guinea pig in the Indian market, Motwane told IANS here, “Absolutely yes, in a way… It's like a guinea pig in the Indian market. The pressure is on us to deliver a great show, and for Netflix too to deliver a great show so that people come and watch it.”
Motwane is part of the Phantom Films banner, which is co-producing the series with Netflix.He says it's nascent days for the web series and the on-demand streaming medium in India.
“If you look back at the British, they have been doing series for years since the 1980s… Americans have been doing quality TV since the 1990s and this streaming thing is going to boom… Of course, a ‘House of Cards' works, Netflix works because of a culture of watching content like ‘The Sopranos', ‘The Wire', ‘Lost', ‘Prison Break', '24', and ‘The West Wing' — all great shows over the years.
“There's a culture of watching such content. We don't have that culture in India… It's developing, and we hope it works,” added the director of Hindi films Udaan, Lootera and Trapped“.
Trending :
For now, they feel it's a “fantastic” idea to have Saif on board for Sacred Games.
“I think we need it (the presence of a star) because we need to sell the medium. At this point of time, it's not so much about the show. There's more pressure on us to be able to sell a medium of watching something and to be able to sell something we're not used to watching,” Motwane said.
Creatively, they feel it's a “great time”, but “the business has to work”, they asserted.
“We need to be able to have that killer show that ends up creating a generation of audience. And having stars on board definitely helps you go out there and push the envelope and get an audience to watch it, because they watch stars,” said Motwane, remaining tight-lipped on the budget of the show.
Meanwhile, Netflix has also announced two more Netflix original shows from India. The first one titled Selection Day is based on the book by author Aravind Adiga, and will deal with cricket and corruption. And the second one is Again, a supernatural, female-led detective series set in New Delhi and written by Marisha Mukerjee, who also wrote Quantico.
