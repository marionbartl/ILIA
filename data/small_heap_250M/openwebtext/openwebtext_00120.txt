Gondola, tapered, 32-foot- (10-metre-) long flat-bottomed boat historically associated with the canals and lagoon of Venice, carrying from two to six passengers. It is propelled from the starboard quarter by a single sweep (oar) manipulated by a gondolier standing on the stern cover, and it has an asymmetrical shape, being 9 inches (23 cm) wider on the port side. A prominent steel beak (ferro) rises from the prow, a lesser one (risso) from the stern. In some gondolas a removable cabin cover (felze) gives passengers shelter and some privacy.
Gondolas are recognizable in paintings by Carpaccio from the late 15th century. The first organized boat racing was done by gondolas in the 16th century; both men and women competed. Once colourful and lavishly decorated, gondolas have been painted black since 1562, when a sumptuary law was passed regulating their appearance. At the time of the edict there were 10,000 in use on the Venetian waters. Today most craft ply for hire, though a few, attended by liveried servants, are still owned privately. The striped or brightly painted mooring posts for gondolas still line many canals. At several locations two-man gondolas called traghetti function as passenger ferries for traversing the Grand Canal.
Gondolas are very costly, and their highly specialized construction is a dying industry. However, their popularity, especially with tourists, remains unabated. A number of river-based cities around the world, and even land-locked hotels such as the Venetian in Las Vegas, Nevada, have adopted them as tourist attractions.
We've got some good news: Nokia's flagship Windows Phone 8 device, the Lumia 920, is now coming to Vodafone. Read on for all the details...
With the New Year just around the corner we thought it was about time we gave you a little update on out Windows Phone 8 plans. A few weeks back we told you about how excited we are to be able to bring a selection of the finest Windows Phone 8 devices in early 2013, and now we've got a new phone to welcome into the Vodafone fold too.
Already confirmed as heading to Vodafone in the new year are the Nokia Lumia 820, the HTC 8X and HTC 8S. They're a stunning set of Windows Phone 8 handsets, but one more can't hurt, can it? With that in mind, we're donning the party hats early in light of the news that we'll also be stocking the Nokia Lumia 920.
Introducing the Lumia 920
Being able to stock the Nokia Lumia 920 is a real boon. It sits right at the top of Nokia's new Windows Phone 8 family with a stunning 4.5-inch ClearBlack display, an 8-Megapixel PureView camera that'll take some of the best shots you've ever seen, and wireless charging built in.
“Being able to stock the Nokia Lumia 920 is a real boon.”
The display's wrapped up nicely under a sheen of Corning's Gorilla Glass, which means it can fight your house keys and come out smiling, while the rest of the case boasts Nokia's now infamous polycarbonate unibody design that sets the 920 and its Lumia brethren apart from the pack.
All that Nokia goodness runs off a meaty Qualcomm Snapdragon dual-core processor, which keeps your mobile experience flying along and makes sure Windows Phone 8 is buttery smooth to use.
The wait for Windows Phone 8
As with all the other Lumia phones, the Nokia Lumia 920 runs on the Windows Phone operating system. This time we're looking at Windows Phone 8, an update to the formula that brings a more customisable homepage layout, support for dual-core processors and a much-improved integration with VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) services like Skype, so you make video calls from your phone.
Luckily, those new features don't come at the expense of what already made Windows Phone great – namely, the Live Tiles that proffer important info without making you actually enter the apps they represent. Oh, and let's not forget the stunning, unified design of the operating system as a whole, which now matches Windows 8 on desktop machines and tablets.
“These new features don't come at the expense of what already made Windows Phone great.”
We're working harder than Santa's elves to make sure that these new Windows Phone 8 dream machines are perfect by the time they land in your pockets.
At the moment, that means we're saying that all four of our Windows Phone 8 phones will arrive in the early stages of next year, but keep your eyes locked to Vodafone Social for a more precise release date, which we'll bring you as soon as we possibly can.
In the meantime, here's a more in-depth look at what we love about Windows Phone 8, to whet your appetite.
The upset caused by GOP President-elect Donald Trump's astounding and unexpected victory has sent largely liberal communities spiraling into depression and suicidal ideations, according to crisis hotlines.
The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline was flooded with calls after Trump's win Tuesday evening, far exceeding call volume from the presidential elections in 2012 and 2008.
“The Lifeline did see an increase in calls over the past few days,” Director of Communications Frances Gonzalez told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “When feelings of loss and anxiety occur due to a major national, regional, or community event, that can aggravate other anxieties or feelings of loss people may be having that are not necessarily election-related.”
What these people are concerned and scared about is that the leftward march under the Obama administration will begin to rapidly recede once Trump takes office.
Crisis Text Line found itself in a similar position in the post-election aftermath. The number of texts doubled, and most of them originated from the LGBT community.
“They were scared about the results of the election and how that might impact them or their friends,” Chief Data Scientist Bob Filbin told Time Magazine. “A lot of the concerns were around policy and how policy might change at the state or federal level.”
Over at Trans Lifeline, executive director Greta Martela said there were 426 callers to the line on election evening.
“We were hoping that we would have an election and things would get better,” Martela said. “This is at a time when the Obama administration has been doing wonderful things for trans people and it's probably all doing to be undone. We're looking at four pretty bleak years.”
Many callers expressed dismay at the fact they'd have to visit their Trump-supporting families for Thanksgiving later in November.
Vice-President-elect Mike Pence, unlike Trump, is much more aggressively traditional. Pence did not support repealing “Don't Ask, Don't Tell” in 2011, and he has prioritized religious freedom over letting the LGBT community make claims of discrimination in the workplace.
He has also criticized Obama's transgender bathroom law.
It's not terribly surprising that many of the suicide calls came from the LGBT community. A study conducted using a sample size of 6,000 transgender adults found that 41 percent had attempted suicide.

Stream: A Sinful Environmental Holocaust!
…The lesson, though, has not been learned. Take the case of Charles Cardinal Bo, Archbishop of Yangon, Myanmar (a.k.a. Burma). In a voice loud enough that others might hear and quote him, he said, “Today we find ourselves faced with an ecological holocaust”.
Holy conflagration! A holocaust!
Why, everybody knows holocausts are bad things, ecological or not. True, when looking out the window, the environment doesn't appear very holocaust-like. But perhaps there are gradations of holocausts? Maybe that the earth's average temperature last year didn't match precisely the earth's temperature from the year before that is a kind of mini-holocaust? A holocaustlette?…
It is a very delicate moment. Pope Francis has raised a great shout loud against this impending disaster talking about modern sins, the ‘ecological sin' made individually and collectively by humans who destroy Mother Earth.
We can allow that destroying “Mother Earth” is a sin, but the good news is that since no man has destroyed the earth, and no man can destroy the earth, there won't be a lot of this sin about. Do you know how much it would take to destroy the planet? Well, let me tell you: a lot. Something on the order of pushing Mars out of its orbit so that it intersects with Mother when she isn't looking. Kapow!…
He said, “Humanity has broken the pact with nature, and that's why it is a profoundly moral issue: an ecological original sin, who needs an ecological conversion and an ecological evangelization.”
Now this is a strange thing for a Christina leader to say because humanity never had a pact with “nature.” Does anybody remember signing a contract with Mom? You also cannot commit a sin against a rock, let alone be tainted from birth by the “ecological original sin” of our distant forefather sinning against a rock. There is no such thing as an “ecological original sin”…
Cardinal Bo appears—I say only appears—to believe it's possible to sin against a nonexistent Mom. Which sounds like paganism. So does calling for an “ecological conversion” sound like paganism. So does asking for an “ecological evangelization” sound like paganism. He also in his speech calls for “ecological justice”, which sounds like he wants to put the squeeze on somebody's wallet…
We summarized five of the biggest reasons to download iOS 10 today, but as BuzzFeed reminded us, there's another big one we left out: You can finally, at long last, delete the stock Apple apps you don't care about.
Don't have an Apple Watch? Delete the Watch app. Do you find the concept of vibrating air waves insulting? Be gone, Music app. Are you trained in the art of celestial navigation? You need no stinkin' Compass.
The process is the same as removing any other app – long-press an app until it jiggles, then tap the ‘x.' Here are the 23 apps you can remove from your home screen:
Calculator
Calendar
Compass
Contacts
FaceTime
Find My Friends
Home
iBooks
iCloud Drive
iTunes Store
Mail
Maps
Music
News
Notes
Podcasts
Reminders
Stocks
Tips
Videos
Voice Memos
Watch
Weather
Really, that just reminded me how many apps are pre-loaded onto our devices that we'll never use.
Still, it's worth noting that this is really more of an aesthetic choice than a space-saving one; Apple says the above 23 apps only take up about 150 MB all together.
It's also worth noting a few caveats. Straight from Apple:
If you remove Contacts, all of your contact information will remain in the Phone app. If you remove the FaceTime app, you can still make and receive FaceTime calls in Contacts and the Phone app. If you remove the iBooks, Maps, Music, or Podcast apps, they won't be available to use with CarPlay. If you try to remove the Watch app from an iPhone that's paired with an Apple Watch, an alert asks you to unpair your Apple Watch before you can remove the app.
That said, sometimes you don't realize what you had until its gone. You can restore removed apps by looking them up in the App Store and downloading them like any other program.
Cheers to Apple for finally doing the sensible thing after 10 major iterations of iOS.

Imagine finding yourself alone in the open water surrounded by 10 sharks. That was the scary situation for one Southwest Florida man Wednesday who got stuck near a sandbar without a boat in sight.
WFTX in Fort Myers spoke with the young man after he was pulled to safety by rescue crews.
Steve Moon, 24, was on a normal mission to lure red fish using cut bait near Burnt Store Marina. Instead, he was nearly left as the bait, stranded and surrounded by sharks.
"It wasn't a big deal until I counted 10, and they kept getting closer and more aggressive, getting within a foot of me," Moon said.
For an hour and a half, Moon used his fishing rod to fend off sharks as they closed in on him.
Out of options and out of signal, Moon decided to use the emergency button on his iPhone to call for help. Moon says Boca Grande Fire Rescue crews were dispatched to him within 10 minutes.
"It's definitely going to be an interesting story. I can't say I've ever been rescued by Coast Guard before. I can't say I've seen that many sharks. It was pretty wild," Moon said.
The European Transparency Register was set up in 2011 after the Commission and Parliament agreed to have a joint register instead of the separate ones they had had earlier. Registration is currently voluntary, but the number of registrants has been picking up steadily in recent years. There are now more than 9,000 organisations on the list with about 1,000 new entries per year.
The transparency of EU decision-making has been an important issue for the Parliament. “On many occasions, Parliament has called for a mandatory register of lobbyists. We are also happy that the Commission now shares Parliament's position and we are determined to go ahead together and ensure that the Council plays its part as well,” said EP Vice-President Guillaume ahead of the public debate.
The Commission launched a public consultation on a mandatory system in March and stakeholders are invited to share their views by 1 June. The Commission's move followed up on the pledge made by Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at the start of his term to pursue more transparency and to propose a mandatory lobby register to Parliament and Council.

Never once have I imagined either of my daughters ever going to prison. Never have I had the image in my head of my children getting finger-printed, photographed and processed by police officers at the local precinct. Never have I imagined Aoki or Ming in an orange jumpsuit walking through intake at LA County Jail. This is not their reality. This is not in their cards. This is not the eventual outcome of their dream deferred.
I moved to California about a year and half ago to be closer to my two beautiful daughters. As they got older, I wanted to be part of their lives every day, and being on the other side of the country just wasn't working. I know that these two girls are blessed. Their education is best in the world. They have the best mother a kid could ever hope for and they have material advantages that other kids their age do not. However, what I admire about Ming and Aoki is that they recognize that kids from other neighborhoods, places that look more like where their daddy grew up, have tremendous obstacles to overcome that my daughters don't have to worry about. So, I try to teach them to not just worry about their own welfare, but also worry about the well-being of all children living in their state, their country and their world.
For far too many children who live just a few miles away from where my daughters are being raised in Los Angeles, going to prison is a norm. And this standard is sadly reinforced by the investment, or lack thereof, of our taxes in their future. In the state of California, we now spend $62,300 per prison inmate per year while only $9,200 to educate a child in a K-12 school. If that statistic doesn't disturb you, consider this: Since 1984, the state has built 22 state prisons while only one new University of California school. As a tax-paying citizen, I find it deplorable that our priorities are focused on expanding our prison system rather than expanding the mind of a child. As I have stated many times in the past, I have no problem paying taxes, as long as it serves to uplift people and keep them out of the justice system, rather than further create space to put more into that system.
That is why I am proud to be the executive producer of a new television ad from Californians for Safety and Justice, an organization bringing together Californians to replace prison and justice system waste with commonsense solutions that create safe neighborhoods and save public dollars. This ad, part of their #SchoolsNotPrisons public education campaign, highlights the implications of perpetually investing in prisons at the expense of our next generation. It highlights the backwards thinking that has infiltrated the mentality of the powerful. The system as set up now serves to maintain a never-ending cycle of loss. Loss of friends. Loss of mentors. Loss of the family unit. Destruction of community. Recent studies have revealed that for many kids, having a parent in prison is more detrimental to a child's health and development than divorce or even the death of a parent. Hundreds of thousands of children in California have parents who are incarcerated. Investing in prisons at the expense of our children is more than tacit approval of dismissing a generation of young children. It is willful ignorance.
We must create more winners, and keep that force moving throughout generations to come. We have already allowed huge a portion of the people I grew up with to fall by the wayside. The deterioration stops now. It's time for us all to stand up. California is at the forefront of this shift. Now is the time to join our movement and fight for #SchoolsNotPrisons.
President Trump issued a brief statement standing by his eldest son following the release Tuesday of emails detailing a meeting with a Russian attorney last year, as the messages fueled critics' claims of "collusion" as well as calls for Donald Jr. to testify before Congress.
White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders read the statement from the president during Tuesday's off-camera press briefing, before referring questions on the matter to Donald Trump Jr.'s outside counsel.
“My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency,” the statement said.
Sanders had adamantly defended the president's son a day earlier. But the emails, which Donald Trump Jr. released on Twitter earlier Tuesday, quickly have caused new headaches for the administration.
What was described as the "entire email chain" showed the discussions that led up to a 2016 meeting between the president's son and a Russian attorney who supposedly claimed to have information that could “incriminate” Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign.
The email from the contact who set up the meeting with attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya described the offer as “part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.” Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort also attended.
Sanders told reporters that the president learned of the meeting in the last couple of days, and did not know the last time he spoke to his son.
DONALD TRUMP JR. RELEASES 'ENTIRE EMAIL CHAIN' REGARDING RUSSIAN MEETING
Trump Jr. released a new statement, along with the email chain, on Twitter, explaining he was releasing the messages “in order to be totally transparent.” The New York Times suggested on Twitter that Trump Jr. only shared images of the emails after “he was told NYT was about to publish the contents of the emails.”
Some top-ranking lawmakers now are seeking Trump Jr.'s testimony. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., top Democrat on the judiciary committee, said Trump Jr. and others should "come before the committee, in open session, as soon as possible."
Senate Republican Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, when asked about the intelligence committee's plans to reach out to the president's son, said he couldn't "imagine a world" where that doesn't happen.
Sanders pushed back when challenged during Tuesday's briefing on the president's claim of “transparency.”
Sanders added: “The willingness to [answer questions] is fully transparent and open to do so through the correct process, whether that's through special counsel or anyone beyond that.”
When also asked about the relationship between President Trump and Vice President Pence, Sanders replied: “There is absolutely no distance between the president and the vice president.”
Sanders told reporters Trump and Pence spoke on Tuesday, but did not know if they spoke about the meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya. Pence's press secretary, Marc Lotter, separately told Fox News on Tuesday that “the Vice President was not aware of the meeting.”
DONALD TRUMP JR. 'DID NOT COLLUDE WITH ANYBODY,' WHITE HOUSE SAYS
“He is not focused on stories about the campaign, particularly stories about the time before he joined the ticket,” Lotter said.
President Trump, through his outside counsel, also has denied knowing about or attending the meeting.
“I stand by everything I said yesterday,” Sanders assured reporters on Tuesday. “I think the president is frustrated with ... the fact that this continues to be an issue and he would love for us to be focused on things like economy, health care, tax reform, and infrastructure and that's where his mind is, and what he'd like to be discussing.”
A day earlier, Sanders said Trump Jr. he “did not collude with anybody to influence the election.”
Trump Jr. accepted the June 9, 2016 meeting offered by publicist Rob Goldstone, who identified Veselnitskaya as “the Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow.”
Revelations and details surrounding the meeting have given Democrats further ammunition in their claims that Trump associates potentially colluded with the Russians during the 2016 election.
“This is a pattern we've seen from senior-level Trump officials that has gone back months where they deny these contacts or meetings with Russians until proof comes out, then they have to recant,” Ranking Member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., told Fox News on Tuesday.
“These emails show there is no longer a question of whether this campaign sought to collude with a hostile foreign power to subvert America's democracy,” Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said.
But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told Fox News on Capitol Hill Tuesday that the Senate Intelligence Committee would look into the matter.
“I'm sure that Senator Warner and Burr will take a look at it,” McConnell said. “They'll get to the bottom of what happened.”
Fox News' Serafin Gomez, Kara Rowland and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.
Colin Powell's endorsement of Barack Obama reverberated throughout the world of politics, with lawmakers and pundits across the political spectrum declaring it a huge boost for the Democratic contender.
Former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich told ABC News, "What that just did in one sound bite... is it eliminated the experience argument."
On the stump today, Joe Biden celebrated the endorsement telling an 11,500-strong rally in Tacoma, Washington that it should put to rest any questions about Obama's readiness to be commander in chief.
"Today we're proud, and I mean this sincerely, very proud to add another critical voice in American public policy and military affairs for the past 25 years to the endormsent list of those who have joined endorsing our ticket, Colin Powell!. Thank you, Colin!"
David Gergen, longtime aide to both Republican and Democratic presidents, called it "the most important endorsement of the campaign."
And an unnamed GOP official told Politico: "This Powell endorsement is the nail in the coffin," said one Republican official, speaking anonymously to offer candid thoughts about the party's nominee. "Not just because of him, but the indictment he laid out of the McCain campaign."
Even Kevin Madden, the telegenic former spokesman for Mitt Romney who's hit the airwaves to support McCain, said:
Endorsements tend to reaffirm what voters already know or like (or dislike) about a candidate's personal and ideological attributes. But the endorsement of Colin Powell is significant because of its timing and the message it sends to swing Democrats and independents...
His endorsement is aimed at easing those doubts about Obama's readiness and experience right at the time voters are making their decision on whom they will support on Election Day.
And Norman J. Orenstein, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, told Politico:
A Powell endorsement now is a huge step to close that sale, to make Obama seem even safer and more attractive as a president.
Susan Eisenhower, the formerly Republican granddaughter of President Eisenhower, who was busy stumping for Obama in southwest Florida today said, "I'd like to associate myself with all the points he made."
We can only hope that the inept handling of the Pathankot terror attack is the worst breach of national security and dignity that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP can inflict on the nation. However, the progressive scale of ineptitude that has been on display doesn't give much hope.
For too long, it was not clear if all the terrorists had been taken out. Indian Express reported there was a blast even while defence minister Manohar Parrikar arrived at the base.
Before that:
The finance minister got into the act saying the siege was over; his statement was followed by reports of more gunfire.
The home minister put out a tweet announcing the end of the attack and then deleted it.
The prime minister was purveying wisdom on yoga and Hinduism.
The defence minister was in Goa, meddling in its seaside politics.
Maybe the terrorists died laughing?
With the BJP, garish spectacle triumphs over quiet diplomacy. In February 1999, Atal Bihari Vajpayee took a bus to Lahore with the famous Bollywood actor Dev Anand in tow and signed the Lahore Declaration. In May that year, India faced the Kargil war. With Modi, the Pathankot terror attack came just a few days after his PR stopover in Pakistan.
Meanwhile, the mainstream media appeared clueless, reporting every leak from the multiple agencies in charge, sowing confusion all around.Television news simply passed off everything as breaking news. The more "intrepid", not wanting to dig and delve into the hard story, went after the human angle: interviewing grieving relatives of the soldiers who were killed, calling them "bravehearts" like medieval Scots and "martyrs" like Islamic fundamentalists.
The newspapers were no better: they simply bought whatever line the government put out and played up the sentimental angle of sacrifice for the nation.
In the event, the social media, some uncompromising publications like The Hindu and The Telegraph and a number of hardnosed commentators nailed the truth. Many questioned the national security adviser's decision to deploy the Defence Security Corps (DSCs) comprising retired soldiers to assist the National Security Guard at Pathankot. There was widespread derision of Mr Modi's preoccupation with yoga and Hindu temples and the now-familiar loose-lipped syndrome of his ministers.
Mr Modi and his party have failed every test of serious governance so far. Remember: climate doesn't change, people grow older. Or, Ganesha's elephant head is proof there were plastic surgeons in those ancient days. Or, India can never abuse nature: earth is our mother; moon is our "mama", echoing a popular Bollywood song of the 1950s.
This government is also demonstrably incompetent. Never mind Pathankot, even in Parliament, where it commands a majority in the lower house, Mr Modi has been unable to get anything done. Plus, he has suffered significant political defeats in Delhi and Bihar. Now there's virtually no hope the BJP can win a majority in the upper house through 2019.
As such, the first-ever majority government since the 1980s finds itself stymied.
Mr Modi's belligerence swayed many away from their normal predilections to vote for him in 2014; hence, the majority. Cocky in victory, he denied Leader of Opposition status to Sonia Gandhi, president of the Indian National Congress. As such, his no-holds-barred approach permitted no negotiation and compromise with the opposition, a sine qua non of democracy.
In just 18 months, he has shown he is simply not prime ministerial material. Never mind his own obvious shortcomings, including gaffes about the flag in Japan and the national anthem in Russia, his cabinet is a distressingly low on intellect and ethics.
The much-admired campaign in 2014 beguiled the electorate: there was dog-whistle rhetoric about Hindutva; a slanderous paid media campaign against a government that delivered a decade of unprecedented prosperity and social welfare; a quixotic promise of a golden age.
There's one more thing in play: during the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, Mr Modi, then Gujarat chief minister, showed up outside the Oberoi Hotel to castigate the government as soft and directionless. This was while security forces were still battling the terrorists. In stark contrast, there has been no politicking by the opposition in the matter of Pathankot.
Mr Modi's future suddenly seems to be limited. The narrative of good governance is shown up as "a tale told by idiots, who strut and fret their hour upon the stage, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing".
After 19th successful spot-kick Everton left-back boasts one of the best conversion rates in Premier League history
A late strike from Leighton Baines clinched a comeback 3-2 victory for Everton against Watford on Sunday and also placed him among the top 10 penalty takers in Premier League history.
The left-back's winner, which came in stoppage time, was his 19th successful PL penalty, making him the third player from Everton to join the list.
The 32-year-old is just two behind team-mate Wayne Rooney, who might have taken the penalty himself had he not been substituted off earlier in the contest, and four behind caretaker manager David Unsworth, who like Baines was also a defender, in the top 10.
Baines has some way to go to catch Alan Shearer, who leads the way with 56 penalties scored in the PL, although the Everton defender beats the competition's all-time top scorer when it comes to his conversion rate.
Having only missed two penalties, Baines boasts a conversion rate of 90.5%; the third-best in the top 10 behind former Southampton midfielder Matt Le Tissier (96.2%) and Arsenal great Thierry Henry (92%).
Sergio Aguero, whose penalty against Arsenal took him 24 scored, is the other active player in the top 10.

Welcome back to the USA Network family, Dulé Hill.
The Psych alum has signed on to join the cast of Suits for the legal drama's upcoming Season 7, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Hill will play Alex Williams, an old friend of Harvey's who's a partner at rival law firm Bratton Gould; he'll be a series regular when Season 7 debuts in July.
Hill should be a familiar face to USA viewers: He spent eight seasons as private eye Gus on the lighthearted procedural Psych, which wrapped up in 2014. He's also known for his key role on NBC's The West Wing as President Bartlet's personal aide Charlie Young.
Earlier this year, Hill co-starred with Katherine Heigl and Laverne Cox in CBS' shortlived legal drama Doubt. He also has a recurring role on HBO's Ballers as Miami Dolphins general manager Larry Siefert.
Suits fans, how do you see Alex fitting into Season 7? Drop your first impressions in a comment below.
The world's highest-flying paper plane: British team send homemade aircraft to the edge of space before it flies back to Earth
NASA, eat your heart out. Who needs a multi-billion-dollar spacecraft to study the Earth when you can use a paper plane?
Pictured here is the incredible British mission to send the plane 17 miles into the atmosphere to capture images of the curvature of the globe using a miniature camera.
The plane, which has a 3ft wing span and is made from paper straws covered in paper, was launched using nothing more powerful than a large helium balloon.
Countdown: The team prepares to launch the helium balloon from a remote spot 50 miles from Madrid
Lift-off: The balloon rises with the paper plane which has a 3ft wingspan and climbed for 90 minutes before the balloon burst
The craft soared to 90,000ft before the balloon exploded, freeing the plane to glide back down, taking photographs as it descended.
And the cost of Operation PARIS (Paper Aircraft Released Into Space)? A modest £8,000.
It was all the work of space enthusiasts Steve Daniels, John Oates and Lester Haines, who said they came up with the idea after being inspired by a project last year to send a lump of cheese into space.
The team launched the balloon from a remote spot around 50 miles west of Madrid after gaining permission from the Spanish authorities.
It took an hour-and-a-half to climb to 90,000ft before the expanding helium burst the balloon.
The team tracked the plane using a GPS navigation system as it took another 90 minutes to glide back to Earth and landed in woodland 100 miles from the release point. But for a hole in a wing, their creation was undamaged.
IT consultant Mr Daniels, 42, of Paignton, Devon, said the team had embarked on the project ‘for a laugh'. Although they spent around £8,000 to make it a success, he said he would happily do it all again
Out of this world: A photograph capturing the curvature of the globe is taken from PARIS at 90,000 ft
Touchdown: The plane safely returns to Earth after climbing 17 miles into the atmosphere during the mission

The immune system mistakenly identifying insulin-secreting beta cells as a potential danger and, in turn, destroying them has long been considered the root cause of type 1 diabetes. Now, an international team of researchers led by City of Hope's Bart Roep, Ph.D., the Chan Soon-Shiong Shapiro Distinguished Chair in Diabetes and professor/founding chair of the Department of Diabetes Immunology, has been able to justify a new theory about the cause of type 1 diabetes through experimental work. The study results were published online yesterday in the journal Nature Medicine.
Type 1 diabetes affects an estimated 1.5 million Americans and is the result of the loss of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.
Now Roep, along with researchers from the Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands, have found a mechanism in which stressed beta cells are actually causing the immune response that leads to type 1 diabetes.
“Our findings show that type 1 diabetes results from a mistake of the beta cell, not a mistake of the immune system,” said Roep, who is director of The Wanek Family Project for Type 1 Diabetes, which was recently created with gifts from the Wanek family and anonymous donors to support the institution's goal of curing type 1 diabetes in six years. “The immune system does what it is supposed to do, which is responded to distressed or ‘unhappy' tissue, as it would in infection or cancer.”
In order to gain a better understanding of why the immune system attacks the body's own source of insulin — the pancreatic beta cells in the islets of Langerhans — the team took some clues from cancer molecules that are targeted by the immune system after successful treatment of the cancer with immunotherapy.
One of these cancer targets is a so-called nonsense protein, resulting from a misreading of a DNA sequence that makes a nonfunctional protein. It turns out that the same type of protein error is also produced by the beta cells in type 1 diabetes. Therefore, Roep and the other researchers believe it is a ‘wrong read' of the insulin gene itself that proves to be a major target of the immune system. This error product of the insulin gene is made when beta cells are stressed, Roep said.
“Our study links anti-tumor immunity to islet autoimmunity, and may explain why some cancer patients develop type 1 diabetes after successful immunotherapy,” he added. “This is an incredible step forward in our commitment to cure this disease.”
According to the paper titled, “Autoimmunity against a defective ribosomal insulin gene product in type 1 diabetes,” the findings “further support the emerging concept that beta cells are destroyed in type 1 diabetes by a mechanism comparable to classical antitumor responses where the immune system has been trained to survey dysfunctional cells in which errors have accumulated.”
The results of the study give Roep new insight, he said, for his work in developing new vaccines to desensitize the immune system so that it will tolerate islets again, as well as for research into combining immunotherapy with more traditional diabetes treatments to reinvigorate islets.
“Our goal is to keep beta cells happy,” Roep said. “So we will work on new forms of therapy to correct the autoimmune response against islets and hopefully also prevent development of type 1 diabetes during anti-cancer therapy.”
About City of Hope's Program
Roep's program at City of Hope plans to change the entire way we view a “cure,” shifting from a one-size-fits-all method of research and goals to a system of precision medicine; a way to offer individualized and personalized therapies for people with diabetes much in the same way cancer treatment does today.
The program will draw heavily from a biorepository, something Dr. Roep says will save millions of dollars and many years in helping them embrace the concept of diabetes being unique in almost every individual. Armed with that knowledge they will dig back into human clinical studies that may not have succeeded on a mass scale and look to see if they can help patients on a smaller scale.
For instance, if a study failed for 70 percent of the participants, it may have held answers for other 30 percent.
The focus at City of Hope will be threefold: to stop the progression of the disease (something Roep calls the “low-hanging fruit” of the effort), get people off injections for good (something he admits is “much more of a challenge but not impossible,”), and preventing, stopping, and reversing complications.
The work described in the Nature Medicine paper was supported by the Dutch Diabetes Research Foundation, the DON Foundation and JDRF.

Episode 384: The Little Lie That Rocked The Banks
Enlarge this image toggle caption Dan Kitwood/Getty Images Dan Kitwood/Getty Images
There's a certain amount of trust underpinning the financial markets. But recent news out of the United Kingdom has shaken the world's faith in a key element of the system.
That element is the number banks use to determine how much to charge their customers — think of it as the measuring stick that determines nearly every other other interest rate around: mortgages, credit cards, corporate loans, complex derivatives transactions. It's called LIBOR, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, and it pretty much underpins everything.
For years, Thomson Reuters has calculated the rate on behalf of the British Bankers Association by asking big banks what they are paying to borrow from other banks. The answers were largely taken on faith. Now it turns out that at least one big bank — Barclays — was skewing the numbers, during the financial crisis and before. Emails cited in a regulatory complaint against the bank show the casual way the efforts were discussed. Other banks are under investigation as well.
The result: Criminal and parliamentary inquiries on two continents, lawsuits, and a lot of mistrust and uncertainty about interest rates across the financial markets.
On today's show, we look at how Barclays bankers sought to manipulate Libor, and why the repercussions will be felt throughout the global financial system for years to come.

SMAP, or "Soil Moisture Active Passive," will measure groundwater content and frozen/thawed state, all over the world every three days.
The satellite called SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) will measure land surface soil moisture content and whether the ground is frozen or thawed. Data is collected for the entire globe every two to three days.
SMAP's lightweight mesh reflector rotates once every four seconds, gathering signals for the satellite's onboard radar and radiometer instruments.
Soil moisture regulates plant growth and affects how heat is exchanged between the ground and the clouds in the atmosphere. The extremes of oversaturated ground and drought can be harmful to life on Earth.
The water cycle describes the constant movement, driven by the energy of the sun, of water above, on and below the surface of the Earth. With the SMAP satellite's data, researchers will gain insights into the state of water, and therefore life, around the world.
LONDON – British Muslims have been organizing community iftars all across the country, welcoming both Muslims and non-Muslims in a bid to share the spirits of the holy month of Ramadan.
“It has been fantastic to see how The Big Iftar has grown again this year,” National Coordinator for The Big Iftar Julie Siddiqi said to express her excitement at the scheme's yearly growth, The World Bulletin reported on Sunday, June 19.
“We are having an Iftar in a Cathedral for the first time and synagogues have been opening their doors too.
“Ramadan really has become known by so many more people now in the UK, which is great to see, and Muslims are realizing the benefit of opening up to people around them, not just Muslims.”
Muslims in UK and most Muslim countries started fasting on Monday, June 6, on the first day of the holy month of Ramadan.
In Ramadan, adult Muslims, save the sick and those traveling, abstain from food, drink, smoking and sex between dawn and sunset.
Muslims dedicate their time during the holy month to be closer to Allah through prayers, self-restraint and good deeds.
Dubbing the event “The Big Iftar”, British Muslims hoped food could offer a path to racial harmony with the wider community.
Launched in 2012, it has provided a platform for iftars to take place in homes, community centers, synagogues, parks, town squares, schools and more.
What started as a small-scale project has generated a growing interest with more than 100 public iftars already being planned across the country.
One of these iftars was held last Thursday at Alyth Synagogue, Golders Green, London.
The iftar included shared learning about Maghrib and Ma'ariv prayers and a chance to watch and participate in both.
Another iftar was organized two days earlier by Nisa-Nashim Harrow, which gathered 30 Muslim and Jewish women to build friendships, learn about Ramadan and eat together.
Britain is home to a Muslim community of nearly 2.8 million, according to the latest population census released in 2011.
In 2011, think tank Demo found that Muslims in the United Kingdom are more patriotic than the rest of population.
Responding to the statement “I am proud to be a British citizen”, 83% of Muslims said they are proud of being British.
In a recent interview with Bladerunner of Bladerunner Radio, BULLETBOYS founding member Marq Torien (vocals/lead guitar) was asked if Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump is someone that he would vote for. Torien responded: "Yes — [based on his] honesty and telling the people what's really going on with our country right now." He continued: "I might not be too fond of the way he's approaching it, but I think he's opening up people's minds to what's really going on right now, as far as our borders and different things like that. But I don't think the way he approached it, as far as calling out the Latino people, was… not the best thing. But he's The Donald — he speaks his mind, just speaks it out, and I have respect for that. But I also have respect for the fact that he is saying these things and people are talking about it. It's creating a conscience in our environment in this country to actually open up our minds. I mean, we were just watching today on CNN where the… [Asking someone off camera] Was it the governor of Arizona? Yeah, she was talking about that… Donald Trump was telling the truth, that they're having very hard problems with this whole thing.
"So, you know, I'm not a political guru, but I do have my pulse on what's happening with this country right now and in life in general."
Torien added: "You know, I'd have to see more, to be honest with you. Wouldn't you? What's going on with things. I'm not very happy with any of the candidates right now. I don't think America is either."
Released in June via Cleopatra/Deadline, BULLETBOYS' latest album, "Elefantè" — the band's first studio album of original material since 2009 — was produced by Ryan Greene (ALICE COOPER, LITA FORD, CHEAP TRICK) and Marq Torien and engineered by Matt Thorne (TRAPT, DISTURBED). The CD was mastered in Nashville, Tennessee by Anthony Focx (MILEY CYRUS, AEROSMITH, SANTANA, BUCKCHERRY).
BULLETBOYS was one of the prominent bands in the flourishing Hollywood metal scene during the late 1980s, with numerous smash hits such as "Smooth Up In Ya", "For The Love Of Money" and "Hang On St. Christopher" off the group's platinum-selling classic self-titled debut and follow-up, "Freakshow", dominating both MTV and radio airwaves.
CTV Vancouver
A driver who was caught with his tablet computer and cellphone tied to his steering wheel was apparently surprised to learn that constitutes distracted driving.
Vancouver police pulled the man over Wednesday morning after an officer spotted him wearing headphones near Cambie Street and Broadway.
When the officer approached the vehicle, he saw the driver had attached his phone to the wheel using a single piece of string, and was using it to prop up his tablet. Police shared a picture of the rig on their traffic unit's Twitter account, where it raised the eyebrows of many responsible drivers.
"Just when I think I've seen everything, a photo like this is captured by one of our officers," Const. Jason Doucette said. "We are reminding our drivers to leave their devices alone behind the wheel."
The officer had a long conversation about road safety with the man, who was ultimately only handed an $81 ticket for not having his driver's licence.
Doucette said police decided to let him off with a warning this time, which some Vancouverites found a little too merciful.
"I think he should be put in jail. [Distracted drivers] endanger people's lives," Lyle Morin told CTV News. "If people start going to jail they might think twice about it."
Normally, getting caught driving distracted isn't cheap; motorists are dinged $368 and given four driver penalty points, which can impact their insurance.
Vancouver police recently handed out a distracted driving ticket to someone who was caught playing the Pokémon Go cellphone game after unknowingly pulling up beside two officers.

Image caption As many as three million protesters have taken to the streets in recent weeks
The French Senate has passed a controversial pension reform bill, which has caused a series of strikes and protests around France.
The senators approved President Nicolas Sarkozy's plan to raise the retirement age from 60 to 62, and it could become law as early as next week.
Mr Sarkozy says the measure is necessary to reduce the deficit.
But hundreds of thousands have protested against what they see as an attack on their rights.
Senators passed the motion to raise the retirement age by 177 votes to 153, after the government used a special measure known as a guillotine to cut short the debate on the bill.
Fuel shortage
The changes would raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the full state pension age from 65 to 67.
The government says the reform is needed to save the indebted pension system from collapse.
Unions say retirement at 60 is a hard-earned right and say the reform is unfair to workers.
"It is not by hanging on symbols of the past that we will remain a great nation," labour minister Eric Woerth told the Senate shortly before the vote.
Analysis President Sarkozy hopes the pension bill's passage through the Senate marks the beginning of the end of the crisis. What happens next is that first thing on Monday, a joint committee of Senate and National Assembly members will meet to agree on a common text. This final version will then be put to a simultaneous vote in both houses of parliament Tuesday or Wednesday. At that point, the law will have been definitively adopted - and the government's calculation is that much of the steam will immediately be taken out of the protests. After all, why demonstrate against something you can no longer change? But for the unions and the left, it is still not the end of the story. They say that until the law is actually promulgated - written into the statute books - they can still force it to be dropped. That process normally takes two or three more weeks. In the meantime - and starting on Thursday - they will be keeping up the pressure.
The protest movement has been spearheaded by the trade unions, although all sections of society have been represented - including schoolchildren.
The unions have called two further days of protests on top of the rolling strikes, on 28 October and 6 November.
The union representing students, Unef, has called a separate day of protest for Tuesday 26 October, urging students to demonstrate and hold sit-ins.
However, the school half-term holidays begin on Friday night and run until 4 November, raising concerns among union members that the protests could lose momentum.
Most of the rallies have been peaceful, but on Friday clashes broke out at an oil refinery blockaded by workers after Mr Sarkozy ordered riot police to get control of the facility.
Two people were hurt outside the Grandpuits refinery east of Paris, which has been embargoed for the past 10 days.
The unions have been blockading all 12 refineries in France in a bid to change the government's mind.
Police also removed protesters from two fuel depots, in Toulouse and Grand Quevilly.

Prime Minister Francois Fillon said it would take several days for fuel supplies to return to normal.
More than 2,000 filling stations around the country have run dry.
There are no plans yet for national fuel rationing, said transport minister Jean-Louis Borloo, but state representatives in two northern districts are already limiting how much petrol each motorist may buy.
Opponents of the bill will now have a chance to take their objections to the constitutional court, before the bill becomes law.
The Great SOCPA Section 165 Scam (UK only)
Perhaps the most well-known provision of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act is that demonstrations can only take place if authorised by the police.
But, buried in this Statute, is the provision for a wonderful money-making scam, which utilises the police (either wittingly or unwittingly - who knows?)
Unfortunately I discovered this scam before I discovered all the other information in relation to Statute so-called 'law'. If I had known then what I know now, the outcome might have been different.
The person involved, the person actually scammed, was a friend of mine. She was driving her car. I was merely a passenger (actually, a 'guest' in Common Law - but I did not know that, at the time). However, this means I can write the events from personal observation.
Summary of what happened
1) In October 2008 she overtook a police car on the Motorway.
2) Blue light went on.
3) She pulled over on to the hard shoulder, stopped the engine, and went back to see what was wrong. The police car had pulled up behind.
4) She came back saying they were going to 'do' her for speeding. They were checking out other things, and would let us continue after the 'checkout' had been done.
5) After 'checking', they said they needed to seize her vehicle. They said her licence had been 'revoked' in 2004.
6) They arranged for her car to be carted away to a Car Pound.
7) This was very late, on a Saturday night. The Car Pound was not open for collections on the Sunday. Consequently she regained her car on the Monday, as soon as possible, and was charged £190 by the Car Pound. In order to achieve this she had to take documents to the police station, accompanied by another of my friends, who was insured to drive any car. (The police released the car into his custody). A point to note here is that the glass screen, which the officer sits behind, had one single notice prominently displayed. Of all the possible things this notice could have referred to, it actually referred to Section 165. (So it's big business!)
8) One other point to add in this summary. The police who stopped her said they probably wouldn't 'do' her for the speeding offence.
Analysis of what happened
The police were using a computer screen in their car. They had downloaded information from the DVLA which indicated my friend's licence had been revoked. Note that word, and think about it. And that this had happened four years ago. Note that, as well. Please also note that my friend was fully insured, the vehicle was validly Road Taxed and MOT'd. She has not been prosecuted for anything - even the speeding offence. All that has actually happened is that she has been 'shaken down' for £190.
Are you smelling 'scam'?
Here's why you are probably smelling 'scam'
We have to go back four years. My friend admits that she may have had a 'run in', but can't remember very much about it. She is absolutely, positively, and vehemently certain that she was never asked, by the DVLA, to send up her licence such that points could be added. (Actually 'physically printed' - see below how this is not, necessarily, relevant in this day & age). My friend is adamant that her licence to drive is a crucial thing for her (she has an invalid son) and that - of all things - she would keep her licence in order as a top priority. (I see no reason to disbelieve).
The likelihood is that a court awarded points for some minor offence. The DVLA did not request her licence due to 'one department not knowing what the other department was doing'. Because she was not notified, she forgot all about it. Because she did not return her licence for 'stamping', the DVLA revoked her licence in 2004.
Now let's look at some facts.
1) In all other matters my friend was 'legal'. She had never had a problem getting Insurance, Road Tax, etc. And yet - according to the DVLA - her licence had been revoked???? Does this make sense? Does this make sense when - as we know - all these agencies computer-connect these days?
2) What does 'revoked' mean? That's pretty draconian, isn't it? It implies that she 'could never drive again'. What could she have possibly done to attain that state? Drink-driving? Well, this would receive a ban, for a period of time, a temporary suspension. But revoked? (BTW my friend is a long way from being an alcoholic). So what's with this 'revoked' business? If she had been banned in 2004 for - say - 3 years, which is a pretty stiff sentence, she would be perfectly entitled to drive in 2008.
3) Anyway, she knows she was never banned. I think someone generally knows if they get banned, don't you?
4) 3, 6, 9 points on a licence does not debarr anyone from continuing to drive. It just means be very careful not to get the 12.
5) In these computerized days, does it actually matter if the points are not, actually, physically printed on a licence? Most agencies have on-line access to one's Driving Record. Placing the points on the computer database, as the DVLA does, could surely be used to supercede physical printing on the piece of paper held by the Driver.
6) And, in any case, if physical printing is so important, surely it would warrant a 'policeman on the doorstep' demanding said piece of paper - in the event that the DVLA do not get a posted response from the Driver?
This whole business shrieks of, at the very least, incompetence and - at worst - a lovely scam. It is hard to believe that, in this day and age, it is not possible for the police to accurately determine - in real time - since they have computers in their cars - whether or not a person's licence is valid, or truly invalid.
So. If you get stopped under Section 165, ask a few pertinent questions, such as:
"I may have collected points on my licence, but I was never banned, I know that for a fact. Consequently I'm fully entitled to drive, irrespective of the word 'revoked' on your computer screen. Is this not the case, officer? That I'm entitled to drive - unless I've been banned?"
"Now, I realise that you have no way of knowing the truth in this respect, but let me please explain something to you. Something you, apparently, don't seem to realise. Under Common Law, which trumps the Section 165 Statute Law, the seizure of my property can only LAWFULLY occur if a Court of Law has said so."
"Now what, specific, Court of Law has authorised you to seize my, specific, car? You are telling me that a Statute authorises you. I'm telling you that Common Law does not authorise you officer... absent, that is, a specific Court Order - and that Common Law trumps Statute Law"
"And I'm telling you something else. That you need to ascertain the truth of this matter, before taking an irrevocable step. Because, put quite simply, if you seize my car, without the authority of a Court of Law, you - personally - will be committing a serious offence. Actually a crime. "
" A crime for which you can be fined, and possibly imprisoned. You see officer, if you check up - and I seriously suggest you do for your own sake - you'll see that Common Law does not recognise uniforms. Common Law does not recognise the uniform you are wearing. The one you think protects you. I can assure you it doesn't . Under Common Law each is responsible for their own actions , whatever clothes they may be wearing at the time."
"It may be that you do not believe a word I'm saying. That's up to you, of course. All I'm suggesting is that you fully ascertain your position and rights in this matter, and mine, before taking a step that you could seriously regret. I'm saying this for your benefit, as well as for mine."
"Why don't you check with your superiors? You have a radio. You can do that right now. Even if they have a smattering of the knowledge of the law, they will tell you to 'hold on a bit''. Try it."
"And, if they have the Internet - which I'm sure they do - they can read FMOTL.com - right here and now - which explains it sufficiency well as to - at the very least - set some alarm bells ringing in someone's head. Alarm bells that would suggest what I'm saying could very well be correct, and that you should check the situation out a lot more thoroughly before having my car towed away. I'll quite happily wait while they do that. It would only take them a quarter of an hour, or so."
"And, while we are waiting, I suggest that you should seriously consider what that word 'revoked' means. The one on your screen. And how, it can possibly have any actual meaning at all. If it said 'banned' or 'temporarily suspended' , one could visualise it having a reasonable meaning. But what, in heaven's name, could I possibly have done, such as to have my licence REVOKED? Revoked, officer, has the same root as the word IRREVOCABLE. As in 'I could never drive again'"
"In summary, officer, you would be acting UNLAWFULLY, and YOU could be prosecuted, for seizing my car without the authority of a court. If there were to be a Court Hearing, the number of points on my licence would be established correctly. If it turns out that I have 12 points or more, then the Court would issue authority, to you, to LAWFULLY seize my car. If it turns out that I have less than 12 points, the Court would agree that I was still perfectly entitled to drive. Is this not the case?"
"That's why we have courts, officer. Isn't it? Isn't that precisely why we have courts. Yes?"
" And, if I may, I'll add one further point. You stopped me while I was driving. You say that I'm not entitled to drive. In that case you should be booking me for driving without a licence - as well as seizing this vehicle. And you haven't mentioned this, have you? How can that be? How can it be that you can just seize the car, without also charging me with driving without a licence? I suggest that you know, by experience, that I'm perfectly entitled to drive, and that the DVLA information is simply out of date or erroneous. How many times have you stopped someone, seized their vehicle, and yet NOT CHARGED WITH DRIVING WITHOUT A LICENCE?"
"On the other hand you know that charging me with driving without a licence won't stick. That can be the only reason why you are not bothering to do that. And that means you must be aware you have no authority to seize my car, for the same reasons."
"Officer, acting on erroneous information will be no defence if you are charged with UNLAWFULLY seizing my property. For the simple reason that you should have established the veracity of the information, before taking action."
"In summary, and with due respect, I suggest that you need to establish exactly how many points are attached to my licence before taking any action. If you can't do that, then your best, and safest, bet would be to book me on the assumption that I'm driving without a licence, and to let me continue on my way, and to let a Court of Law decide the matter. I'm sure a court will impose a stiffer penalty if - upon investigation - it is established that I truly am diving while unlicenced."
(They know the score. They are not stupid. They know, deep down)
If the policeman insists that s/he has to apply SOCPA Section 165 then point out
"Officer. That is a Statute. It is the law-of-the-sea. And we are on dry land. SOCPA, therefore, has no applicability. You are way outside your lawful authority and any jurisdiction. You may not know or understand it, but I do. And I will make sure my rights are upheld. That's a promise. And, because you and your colleague are personally taking this action, then it is you and your colleague I will hold personally responsible. I've given you many reasons to check up on your proposed actions, so you cannot claim you have not been told. You need to discover the immense difference between Statutes and Law."
If they respond "Are you a Lawyer then?", the response is "No, but I understand Common Law, and you - quite obviously - don't"
(Note: There are a few Policemen who actually know all this. And they shake their heads in disgust at it all. However they are outnumbered/swamped by colleagues who have no idea what they are doing. We must support these few decent Coppers, by supporting ourselves. They will gain strength from actions we take, such as this)
Veronica: of the Chapman family
January, 2009
Physicians in Canada were paid a total of $25 billion in 2014–2015, up from $24.1 billion during the previous period, according to a new report.
The average payment per physician remained virtually unchanged at $339,000 nationally, the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) said Tuesday in its annual report.
Total gross payments to physicians represent an increase of 3.7 per cent over the previous year — the second-lowest increase since 1999–2000.
Understanding how many physicians there are and how much we pay for their services could help in allocating health-care resources, said Geoff Ballinger, CIHI's manager of physician information in Ottawa.
Average payment estimates are gross amounts that in most cases include the overhead costs of running physician practices, such as staff salaries, medical equipment and supplies, and office rent.
To put the $25 billion in total gross payments to doctors into perspective, Canada spends $18 to $20 billion a year on defence.
In 2015, there were 82,198 physicians in Canada, representing a 2.9 per cent increase over 2014.
A snapshot of physician supply in Canada. (CIHI)
Between 2011 and 2015, growth in the number of physicians outpaced population growth threefold. For the ninth year in a row, the number of Canadian physicians per population increased at a fast rate, to 228 physicians per 100,000 Canadians, totalling 82,000 in 2015.
"The good news is the number of physicians is increasing faster than the growth in the population," Ballinger said in an interview. "But there are situations and pockets in the country where perhaps there aren't enough physicians practising."
The average gross clinical payment per physician varied across the country. The average gross payment per physician was $339,000, ranging from $258,000 in Nova Scotia to $366,000 in Alberta. Ballinger said 2015 was the first year Alberta topped the country in average gross clinical payment per doctor.
For the first time, the institute provided a breakdown of the average amount by physician speciality. For example, nationally:
Family physicians — $271,000.
Medical specialists — $338,000.
Surgical specialists — $446,000.
In 2015, Nova Scotia had the most physicians per 100,000 population (261). The provinces with the fewest physicians per 100,000 were P.E.I. (181), Saskatchewan (196) and Manitoba (204).
The demographics of Canada's physicians continue to evolve. Last year, 40 per cent of all physicians in Canada were female, up from nearly 37 per cent in 2011.
Women represented a larger proportion of family medicine physicians (45 per cent) than specialists (35 per cent.)
More time with patients
Based on the number of MD degrees awarded by Canadian universities, the number of physicians is likely to continue to increase, the institute said.
Younger physicians don't tend to put in the 60-hour work weeks as older physicians did, Ballinger noted.
Historically, physicians have been remunerated mainly through fee-for-service payments.
Over time, there has been a growing shift toward alternative payment plans, but this trend appears to have stabilized, CIHI said.
"In terms of the way they're paid, physicians were predominantly paid on a fee for service basis in years past and this would encourage physicians to see as many patients as possible," Ballinger said.
"Now they're not paid that way as often and so physicians are seeing perhaps fewer patients but I think the prevailing view is the quality of care is perhaps a little better because they can spend more time with their patients."
On average, Canada experienced a brain gain with more physicians returning to the country than leaving.
Currently, about a quarter of the physician workforce trained outside of Canada, which Ballinger said is down from the 1970s.
"I distro surfed when Canonical announced the end of Unity. Ubuntu GNOME received the most attention from the team. We figured that it's essentially the future of Ubuntu and we better get to know our new product. GNOME stood out. There was an abundance of technologies, thoughtful workflow, and with the extensions framework we saw the potential to shape the desktop to our customers' needs. We liked GNOME. We adapted existing themes, icons, and fonts to the System76 brand. Then boot branding. Then distro settings and default apps. Then it wasn't Ubuntu desktop anymore," says Carl Richell, CEO, System76.
Richell further says, "Today, our first beta arrives. Download and install it. Tell us your thoughts and about any unexpected behavior. We're here to answer questions, fix bugs, and refine this release so it shines come October 19th. Even with it being only our first swing, we intend to knock your socks off."

While there are certainly too many Linux distributions nowadays, I do see value in a computer-seller taking control of the overall user experience. Since System76 customers often focus on creativity, it is wise to foster that with Pop!_OS, hopefully inspiring users to create bigger and better things. Ultimately, there is room for System76's operating system among the already-crowded Linux distro landscape.
Richell shares a statement about Linux that is quite poignant, which I share below.
With Linux we don't need a single operating system that caters to everyone. That's what macOS and Windows have to be. Not Linux. Diversity is our strength.

Now we know that the Noble Eightfold Path can be simplified into 3 – morality, stillness and wisdom. So we think oh, we do a little bit of good here, meditate a bit there and read a book to develop our wisdom.
That's not how the Noble Eightfold Path works. Doing all those things is good, but it's not enough – because it's too sporadic, disjointed and incohesive to have much effect- so each of the 8 factors of the path can't develop enough power. And that's why almost no one gets anywhere these days.
I was reading some writings of Ajahn Pannavaddho – the most senior western disciple of Ajahn Maha Boowa (who was considered an enlightened Arhat of our recent times). He writes with such authority that it seems as if he himself has personally gone through this – as he seems to be speaking from direct experience.
And he says that the Noble Eightfold Path is like this:
By “Right” – we mean “Perfect”.
So we need:
Perfect moral virtue (Sila) – perfect speech, perfect actions and perfect livelihood
(Sila) – perfect speech, perfect actions and perfect livelihood Perfect peace of mind (Samadhi) – perfect effort, perfect mindfulness and perfect stillness
(Samadhi) – perfect effort, perfect mindfulness and perfect stillness Perfect wisdom (Prajna) – we need to view things from a perfect perspective with perfect intention
And what happens is that we need to develop each of these 8 factors individually (until they are pretty much perfect) such that they reach a sufficient level of power within us. Each of these factors don't work in isolation, but if 1 factor gets better it also raises the other factors too and vice versa. So each of the factors mutually support each other.
And once ALL the factors have gathered enough power within you, all at the same time – then what happens is that they SIMULTANEOUSLY converge at a point to form a bridge – a Noble Eightfold Pathway to Nirvana to enable you to glimpse Nirvana – and that's what Stream Entry (the 1st of 4 stages of the Enlightenment of an Arhat) is all about.
Once you have seen for yourself what enlightenment is all about – you will see the absolute necessity of having moral virtue. There will no longer be any doubt – you will have an unshakeable certainty about what the Buddha was talking about.
And this convergence of all the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path – will become a bridge that you can use to cross over from this side (Samsara) to the other side (Nirvana).

I got this idea from the 4th Equestria Girls movie with Sci Twi singing "The Midnight Within me", so I decided to do it with Sunset, because even though she seems accepting of what happened in the past I'm sure she regrets it deeply whenever she thinks about it.Makes me think if they make another Equestria Girls movie (I'm not 100% sure if they are or not) that they should make it more about Sunset's past because even though it was mostly reflected on in the 2nd Equestria Girls movie, and a fair bit in the third, I feel like Sunset needs another song other than the "My Past is Not Today" to talk about how she deeply regrets what she did when she was a different person.Again, just a little idea I had, I probably would've done a better background but I couldn't think of anything else. So enjoy it nonetheless.MLP (C) Hasbro
Only about six litres of oil remained in B.C.'s English Bay late on Friday night when a Transport Canada plane flew over the site of the recent spill, and most of that would have evaporated overnight, according to a Canadian Coast Guard official.
Assistant commissioner Roger Girouard said on Saturday there is currently no indication of distress among marine mammals, but a number of teams are on the water monitoring the situation.
"The small number of birds impacted is an indicator of how successful we were getting the oil as fast as possible," Girouard said at a morning news conference.
An estimated 2,700 litres, or more than two tonnes, of oil was spilled on Wednesday.
Girouard said the focus now turns to what he described as the small amount of oil that managed to make it to shore
"On the shoreline, every indication we have is the soiling is in fact minor," he said. "There are a couple of spots where a one-metre globule got onto some rock, but in the main, even on the worst-impacted site in West Vancouver, thankfully the impact is relatively minor."
"That does not mean we won't address it."
Girouard said crews will work on shoreline cleanup over the next several days.
"Today, we have a full day of teams on the beach," he said. "That will continue throughout the weekend and into the week."
Residents asked not to assist
He reiterated the coast guard's earlier request that residents not assist with cleanup efforts.
The spilled bunker fuel is "not healthy stuff," he said. "You will see signs at the beach to stay clear of the water. Please don't get into a venture of doing your own cleanup and don't do any wildlife assistance on your own. Call us and let the experts do their work."
Roger Girouard, assistant commissioner of the Canadian Coast Guard, says oil removal is going well, but asked residents not to help because the spilled bunker fuel requires professional cleanup crews. (CBC)
Girouard said the source of the leak has been traced to a hull outlet on the Marathassa, a Cypriot-registered bulk carrier recently built in Japan.
He said the vessel meets all modern standards and was on its maiden voyage. It was anchored in the harbour waiting to take on a load of grain when it began leaking oil.
Girouard said the fact that the Marathassa is a modern ship, recently built, makes the spill all the more puzzling.
The company that owns the ship is based in Greece, but it sails under the flag of Cyprus — a well-known flag of convenience in the shipping industry. Ships traditionally register with countries where labour is less expensive or safety regulations are more lax.
We need to talk about The Simpsons.Yes, we had good times on the monorail, and it was pretty crazy when Maggie shot Mr. Burns — but something's changed.
Dan Mulhall and Jack Picone, two diehard fans who still think in Simpsons quotes, are trying to figure out how the family that doesn't age got old. Their podcast, The Worst Episode Ever, is solely dedicated to rooting out the single worst episode the series has ever produced. You know, for science.
Today they join Shad to explain their bittersweet quest, reveal their current pick for worst episode, and ponder if their beloved show is like an old dog that needs to be put down.
q: Are you among the legions of lapsed Simpsons fans? Do you know why you stopped watching the show? If you've seen recent episodes, how do they compare to the classics?
First koala spotted in 75 years in Kosciuszko National Park
Updated
A koala has been spotted in Kosciuszko National Park — the first confirmed sighting in 75 years.
NSW National Parks Area Manager Matt White said a motorist spotted a healthy male koala crossing the Snowy Mountains Highway in late November, near Blowering Dam, east of Tumut.
"It continued towards a stand of eucalypts and was seen climbing up one of the trees where it stayed looking quite content," Mr White said.
"We're not sure if the sighting is an isolated individual that has wandered in looking for suitable vacant habitat or if it marks the discovery of a previously unrecorded wild population."
According to NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), the last record of a koala in the park was near Batlow in 1940, although there was an unconfirmed sighting near Talbingo shortly afterward.
"We haven't even looked for koalas for decades there, it's so rare," Mr White said.
The nearest known populations are 150km away, at Cooma, Albury and Narrandera.
It's not unusual for males to be found on their own, as they look for a mate.
"This one has either travelled a long way, or there are populations we don't know about."
NPWS officers have been back out to the area, but have not found the koala.
They plan to return with a larger team to conduct a more extensive survey of the area.
"The background in a couple of the photos is distinguishable as definitely confirming the koala was spotted where it was reported," Mr White said.
How much travel can a koala bear?
Koala ecologist Stephen Phillips said koalas left their mother's colony to avoid territorial fights with their father.
This occurs around one or two years of age, until the appearance outside the pouch of the next season's joey. If the mother has not produced another joey, then the joey will stay longer ensuring it has a greater chance of survival.
Dr Phillips said, once they left their mothers, koalas could travel long distances.
"They're physically and metabolically equipped to travel long distances when they need to," he said.
"We've had some radio-tracked koalas cover 60 to 70km over the course of two or three months while they're looking for somewhere to live."
Dr Phillips said the job of the male was to find some ideal habitat and then start attracting a mate.
"The male call is a very low frequency call, and it can travel many, many kilometres, especially in mountainous terrain," he said.
"The call becomes a source of attraction for females, and helps males mark out their territory."
A sign the revegetation program is working
The area has been the site of a revegetation program over the past seven years.
Parks workers and volunteers have planted more than 800,000 trees on land that was once cleared for farming.
"This sighting could be an indication that we haven't been looking hard enough, or that our revegetation program is working," Mr White said.
The NPWS would like to hear from anyone who spots a koala in Kosciuszko, by contacting the NPWS Tumut office on 02 6947 7000.
"I'd hate for him to get all this way and be run over by a car," Mr White said.

To the Blockstack Community:
At Blockstack, we have always been planning for the far future. We intend for Blockstack to have a truly decentralized future, and we believe this means that no single entity must drive the system, including the founding organization with the original developers.
Blockstack passed many milestones this year: we've registered more than 73,000 domains on our new decentralized internet, raised $4M in funding, doubled the core team, saw many amazing applications emerge, and organized the second Blockstack summit in Mountain View, which grew attendance 4x.
Today, at the Blockstack Summit 2017, we announce the Blockstack token and mining system. The Blockstack token gives stakeholders in the community more control over the protocol, establishes rewards for app developers, and introduces new features. More information on introducing tokens and incentives into Blockstack are discussed here and here.
It's All About the Long-term
We're seeing a renewed interest in the crypto-economy. At Blockstack, we started working on this technology in 2014. Long before the area was getting mainstream attention, we dedicated our time and energy to our mission while the crypto-economy was in uncertain times, and we'll keep working on it regardless of market conditions. We know the builders who truly believe are out there, driven by our shared mission for a new and better internet, and that their drive does not fluctuate along with market interest. We need those builders, dreamers, engineers, and hackers to come together to build a shared ecosystem on this new internet.
Our task is intelligently constructing a system that has the capability to evolve based on the will of the actual stakeholders in the community, not the ideology of a few core developers or the whims of the vocal minorities or the pressure of a few thousand nodes.
A Blockstack token allows us to do all of this. With the Blockstack token and mining, we can make something that can function effectively beyond the lifetime of a single company.
We thank you in advance for your participation in our growing movement and remind you again that we are planning for the long-term, and hopefully, you are too. We believe this is the most sustainable, scalable, and stable approach to truly creating a decentralized internet built for developers and everyday users, and will continue to do so, for the decades to come.
A Note About Future Announcements
We will announce more details about the token sale in the coming weeks.
From what we've seen with previous projects, we expect a number of phishing sites to pop up. Imposters will announce details around the timing and location of fake token sales.
With this in mind, it's extremely important to be careful with any communication related to the Blockstack sale. When the sale is set to start, we will give ample advanced notice and will never ask you to click a link. We will instead direct you to type “blockstack.org” directly into your browser. Further, it's important you do not trust any information related to the token sale unless it's (1) published on https://blockstack.org (2) published on our github at github.com/blockstack (3) confirmed by @Blockstack and @muneeb and @ryaneshea on Twitter.
Thank you and stay tuned for more updates.
I didn't want my first post after introducing myself on Steemit to be quite so controversial. However, today we have seen a massive downward movement of the price on Bitcoin and many are saying that it's a 'correction' or the 'Bitcoin bubble finally breaking'.
You can show support to my original article on Quora here: Why is bitcoin going down? Will it come up again soon?
To anyone that is concerned over Bitcoin's price going down, I urge calm and research. This is what has caused the price of Bitcoin to go down to the 15000$ range. And it's very serious:
For the last 9 hours or more, Coinbase / Gdax have been pegging the price of Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash at a rate of 0.2 BTC
$3000 BCH : $15,000 BTC
update 5pm: $3100 BCH : $15,500 BTC
update 5:30pm: $3200 BCH : $15,900 BTC
update 6:30pm: $3100 BCH : $15,500 BTC
One of the largest exchanges in the world is currently manipulating the market, by pegging Bitcoin's value to another currency and, therefore, preventing the two markets from resuming their natural growth.
If this is intentional, then it is very serious and questions the ethics and motivations of both Coinbase / GDAX and Bitcoin Cash. No official statement has been released as of yet, but the damage has already been done.
Anyone with a conscience would boycott Bitcoin Cash and Coinbase now.
EDIT: here is a discussion on Reddit with both for and against arguments to whether the pegging on Coinbase affected the price of Bitcoin yesterday here and here
Research the background and activities of Roger Ver, the man pushing Bitcoin Cash together with Jihan Wu, the co-founder of the company Bitmain. Bitmain is :
You will discover many interesting links and realise the dangerous power struggle between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.
Especially the close ties between Roger Ver and Bitmain, the mining company - which now only accepts Bitcoin Cash as payment for their products. A clever push, considering how much influence they already hold in the cyrpto-verse.
Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of Bitcoin, supported largely by Chinese miners and as a result:
This centralisation gives them a lot of power over the blockchain's behaviour. In addition to that, they have control over a lot of wealth from years of Bitcoin mining with which they are now serving their own agenda.
ANTBLEED scandal
Not only that, Bitmain has openly admitted to using potentially harmful code in their mining equipment that makes miners vulnerable to having their machines turned off by Bitmain. The company tried to sell it as an improvement. But it can easily be used to target certain customers and groups for financial gains (see the article for details).
This happened in April, a long time ago for the internet to remember and bring to the attention of the thousands of new investors since November who don't know this.
ASICBOOST scandal
If that wasn't enough, Bitmain also openly admitted to using AsicBoost in their miners. AsicBoost gives an unfair advantage to miners that use it and Bitmain and its mining pools have rejected the Segregated Witness soft fork (SegWit), because it is preventing the covert use of AsicBoost technology embedded in their chips.
The company had been using the technology secretly and the official statement from Bitmain only came, after their use of AcicBoost was discovered.
Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin
Roger Ver has now been on CNBC, where where he claimed that Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin. Nowhere did they indicate during the interview the clear bias Roger Ver has.
During the same interview, he also told millions of Americans that Bitcoin holders should send their BTC to exchanges to be ready for the Bitcoin bubble bursting. Today, the price of Bitcoin Cash was pegged to Bitcoin on Coinbase, making the price go down. Interesting, right? What a self-fulfilling prophecy. And many shaky hands will likely follow, helping the downward trend.
Even if it were true that Bitcoin Cash offers some advantages over Bitcoin, the shady activities of its backers is a serious cause of alarm and a threat to the sustainability of cryptocurrencies and what they stand for.
Forbes March 21:
“certain technical upgrades, including a block size increase, require what's called a hard fork, which runs the risk of creating two versions of bitcoin if not done with the full support of the community. Many consider this type of hostile hard fork a potential nuclear option in bitcoin — one that could destroy, or at least damage, the industry that, until last Thursday, had a $20 billion market cap”
Is This Massive Power Struggle About To Blow Up Bitcoin?
Max Kasier on RT November 18:
“Bitcoin cash is an alt-coin that has its fans just like many alt-coins. I don't think anyone who uses bitcoin's name and applies it to an alt-coin like bitcoin cash does is adhering to acceptable business practices. In other words, bitcoin's brand is being stolen by a competitor that calls itself bitcoin cash and this is outright fraud in my opinion, just like it's fraudulent to use Coca-Cola and Nike's name to sell soft drinks or shoes,” said Max Keiser
'Bitcoin is a gift from God to help humanity sort out mess it has made with its money' – Max Keiser
In conclusion: please research
the creation story of Bitcoin Cash (Bitcoin ABC/Bitcoin Unlimited)
the relationship between Roger Ver and Jihan Wu
and the background of Bitmain, the mining company
And make an ethical decision about supporting them
I gave many links to get you started with.
The technological drawbacks of Bitcoin / Bitcoin Cash are out of the scope of this article. But if the technological drawbacks are your concern, then there are dozens of cryptocurrency projects without such ethical stains out there that deserve your support.
To anyone critical of this post, I want to say this: the point of Steemit and Quora is to offer quality content, so I'm not going to repeat everyone else - in all likelihood, you already heard all of the mainstream arguments like corrections, bubbles, Christmas, panic sellers, etcetera. In this post, I am offering balance to the views on what's going on, especially since the majority of people don't have time to closely follow the massive flow of information on the internet. The internet has a memory that is way too short anyway. So let's revisit and research the issues from our recent past.

Last week, I talked about interesting concepts in computer science. Most of the resulting discussion revolved around the halting problem, but one person asked for clarification about Yao's Millionaires' Problem. What is it? How does secure multi-party computation allow you to solve it? Why is the solution on Wikipedia so complicated?
So, this week, I'm going to explain how to solve millionaire-style problems without resorting to any sort of cryptography.
The Problem: Socialist Millionaires
Two employees, Alice and Bob, want to know if they are being paid fair wages. They do the same amount of work at the same level of quality, but they suspect that their employer might be taking advantage of one of them.
The easiest way to determine if they make the same amount of money per hour is for both to say “I make X dollars per hour”. Unfortunately, although Alice and Bob trust each other, they are very private about their income. They consider it a huge social faux pas to reveal how much money you make. The possibility of common knowledge of who makes more money is just… too uncomfortably awkward to bear.
Not only do Alice and Bob refuse to reveal how much money they make, to each other or a trusted third party, but they're a bit technophobic and refuse to enter the information into a computer for fear of it being logged.
How can they find out if they're being paid fairly, without risking an awkward situation and without using computers? With locked suggestion boxes, of course!
The Solution: Use Locked Suggestions Boxes
Suppose Alice and Bob each might be making either 10, 20, 30, or 40 $/hour. We'll arbitrarily say that Alice makes 30$/hour and Bob makes 20$/hour.
Bob goes to an office supply store and buys four lockable suggestion boxes (with different matching keys). He labels the four boxes as 10$, 20$, 30$, and 40$. Bob discards all of the keys except the key for the 20$ box (because that's how much he makes per hour). Bob gives the locked suggestion boxes to Alice. In private, Alice puts a slip of paper saying ‘yes' into the 30$ box (because that's how much she makes per hour). She puts slips of paper saying ‘no' into the other boxes. Alice gives the boxes back to Bob. In private, Bob uses his key to unlock the 20$ box and get the slip of paper inside. Bob sees that the slip of paper says ‘no', meaning Alice doesn't make 20$/hour like he does. He tells Alice they don't make the same amount of money. Bob now knows that Alice doesn't make 20$/hour, but hasn't learned if she makes 10, 30, or 40 $/hour. Similarly, Alice now knows Bob doesn't make 30$/hour, but hasn't learned if he makes 10, 20, or 40 $/hour.
Oblivious Transfer
The technical term for what Alice and Bob did in the previous example is oblivious transfer. Alice transferred many messages to Bob, but is oblivious to which single message Bob received. Alice sent an answer for every possible amount of money Bob might make, but Bob only received the answer corresponding to how much money he actually makes.
Note that there's a certain amount of trust required for this to work. If Bob is going to lie and pretend he makes 30$/hour, there's no way to detect the problem. There are also other ways to cheat, but they can mostly be detected or prevented by adding complications to the solution. For example, Bob can show Alice the slip he pulled out, to prove he's not just lying about the outcome. I don't want to dig too deep into the details of what types of cheating you can prevent… suffice it to say that it goes very deep.
If Bob and Alice were using computers, instead of physical items, they would have used public key cryptography instead of locked suggestions boxes. This makes the computer protocols harder to understand, but removes a lot of corner cases inherent in the physical protocol. It's much easier to prevent Alice from secretly marking the slips of paper saying ‘no', so she can determine which box Bob opened, for example.
Summary
You can perform oblivious transfers without computers, using locked suggestions boxes.
The ability to do oblivious transfers is the basis for performing any secure multi-party computation.

this Vegan Edamame Egg Salad is a plant based makeover of everyone's favorite classic sandwich stuffer, with an extra serving of protein from edamame, and flavor from colorful spices.
Vegan Edamame Egg Salad
Though my view on eggs has always been sketchy, one thing I crave now and then is an egg salad sandwich. Or just egg salad in general, actually.
Before giving up eggs altogether, I used to make Edamame Egg Salad.
Replacing the egg with tofu and adding a few more ingredients to elevate it from a basic recipe, this comes close to the original.
Jason gave it a yes vote also, hopefully for more than the large amount of pepper I added to his. If you have Kala Namak, use it here. Kala Namak – or black salt – gives that sulfur taste to food, to mimic the flavor of an egg.
Jason likes his pepper. A couple years ago I found him a pepper grinder made by the same person who makes his drum sticks. Awesome.
Most of the time I make egg salad sandwiches with my Spinach Pancakes as bread, but this time I wrapped it into corn tortillas. Edamame egg salad tacos? Try it!
Vegan Edamame Egg Salad
dairy, egg, oil, and gluten free, vegan
INGREDIENTS:
1/4 cup cashew cream
1 teaspoon rice vinegar
1 teaspoon yellow mustard
small pinch (start with 1/8 teaspoon) Kala Namak / black salt
(or 1/2 teaspoon regular sea salt)
1 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon turmeric
1 block extra firm tofu
3/4 cup fresh or defrosted shelled edamame
3 fresh green onions, trimmed and chopped fine
INSTRUCTIONS:
Drain and press tofu.
In a medium size mixing bowl, combine cashew cream, vinegar, mustard, salt, pepper, and turmeric.
Chop tofu into small pieces (approximately 1/4 inch squares).
Fold tofu, edamame and onions into cashew cream mixture. Cover and transfer to refrigerator, allowing flavors to combine, at least one hour.
Serve in a sandwich, over salad greens or quinoa, or in a taco shell!
Really, every time I see these photos I want to eat this again, immediately.

The U.S. jobless rate was unchanged at 10% in December, following a decline the previous month, but the government's broader measure of unemployment ticked up 0.1 percentage point to 17.3%.
The comprehensive gauge of labor underutilization, known as the “U-6” for its data classification by the Labor Department, accounts for people who have stopped looking for work or who can't find full-time jobs. Though the rate is still 0.1 percentage point below its high of 17.4% in October, its continuing divergence from the official number (the “U-3” unemployment measure) indicates the job market has a long way to go before growth in the economy translates into relief for workers.
The 10% unemployment rate is calculated based on people who are without jobs, who are available to work and who have actively sought work in the prior four weeks. The “actively looking for work” definition is fairly broad, including people who contacted an employer, employment agency, job center or friends; sent out resumes or filled out applications; or answered or placed ads, among other things.
The U-6 figure includes everyone in the official rate plus “marginally attached workers” — those who are neither working nor looking for work, but say they want a job and have looked for work recently; and people who are employed part-time for economic reasons, meaning they want full-time work but took a part-time schedule instead because that's all they could find.
In the coming months, the U-6 measure may be an important signal for the labor market. The official jobless rate is likely to hold steady or rise through the first half of the year as more people return to the job market. That means Americans who now fall into the U-6 category, for stopping their job searches due to discouragement, will eventually fall into the U-3 category as they restart their job hunt.
A U-6 figure that converges toward the official rate (even an official rate that's above 10%) could indicate improving confidence in the labor market and the overall economy. This month pushes convergence even further away.
Russian president says Moscow will not ignore incidents in which two soldiers were killed, but which Kiev denies took place
Vladimir Putin has accused Ukraine of plotting terrorist attacks in Crimea and claimed two Russian servicemen were killed in clashes this week, as tensions over the peninsula rise to their highest level since Russia annexed it in 2014.
Ukraine denied the alleged incidents had taken place and dismissed the claims as Russian provocation.
In characteristically bellicose language, Putin accused Ukraine of playing a dangerous game.”We obviously will not let such things slide by,” the Russian president said on Wednesday. Ukraine had “resorted to the practice of terror”, he said.
Putin's warning that Russia would not ignore the incidents will worry observers. The increased tension in Crimea comes at a time when the simmering conflict in eastern Ukraine appears to be heating up. There are almost daily casualties on the frontline between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebel military formations, and little sign of a resolution to the conflict, in which more than 9,000 people have been killed over the past two years.
Vladimir Putin may believe time is ripe for another invasion Read more
Russia's security service, the FSB, said in a statement that one of its officers had been killed during a shootout with a “group of diversionaries” on Saturday night, when they were supposedly discovered just inside Crimea's border with mainland Ukraine. It said the group had 20 homemade devices with a total of 40kg of explosives in their possession.
The FSB said there had been a further incident on Monday involving “massive firing” from the Ukrainian side of the border and attempts to enter the region by force, during which another Russian soldier died.
“On the night of 8 August 2016, special operations forces from the Ukrainian defence ministry carried out two more attempts to make a breakthrough by sabotage-terrorist groups,” it said.
The FSB said it had arrested a man named Evgeny Panov, allegedly a Ukrainian military intelligence operative born in 1977, and said he had made a confession. It gave no further information.
“This is a very dangerous game,” said Putin. “We will of course do everything to assure the security of infrastructure, citizens and will take additional measures to provide security, including serious additional measures.”
The FSB said Kiev's aim was the “destabilisation of the socio-political situation in the region during preparation for elections”. Russia will hold nationwide parliamentary elections on 18 September, with Crimea taking part for the first time since its annexation.
Locals in Crimea have noted a large amount of Russian military hardware on the move in recent days, and the de facto borders between Crimea and Ukraine were closed over the weekend and subject to increased security checks when they reopened.
Ukraine's defence ministry said: “This kind of FSB statement is nothing more than an attempt to justify the relocation and aggressive actions of Russian military units on the temporarily occupied peninsula.
“Russian security services are trying to distract the population of Crimea and the international community from its criminal actions, turning the peninsula into an isolated military base.”

Oleskandr Turchynov, the head of Ukraine's national security and defence council, also dismissed the claims. “The hysterical and false statement by Russia's FSB has no purpose other than an attempt by occupiers to inflame the situation on temporarily occupied Ukrainian lands,” he said.
Russia annexed Crimea in a swift military operation following the February 2014 revolution in Kiev that deposed the Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Armed men in unmarked uniforms fanned out across the peninsula and seized Ukrainian army bases and other key infrastructure. At the time Putin vehemently denied the men were Russian soldiers,but he later admitted they were.
Crimeans voted overwhelmingly to join Russia in a referendum that the international community dismissed as flawed and illegitimate and which led to western sanctions against Russia that are still in place.
Ukraine has said it will never give up its claim to the peninsula, but it has acknowledged in the past that it does not have the military capability to regain control. Ukrainian authorities have tacitly supported a blockade of Crimea by a group of Crimean Tatars, an indigenous ethnic group largely opposed the annexation. Crimean Tatars blocked trucks from entering Crimea from mainland Ukraine for several months last year and even blew up electricity pipelines, leading to blackouts on the peninsula.
Putin has promised infrastructure will be built in the next few years to make Crimea self-sufficient in energy. Moscow is also building a bridge to link the peninsula with the Russian mainland across the Kerch Strait. It is due to open in 2018.
Crimea's governor, Sergey Aksyonov, who was appointed by Moscow, said attempts to destabilise the peninsula during the summer tourist season would be prevented “in the harshest possible way”, promising that the region was safe for residents and tourists.
Igor Plotnitsky, the head of the self-declared Luhansk People's Republic, was admitted to hospital after an assassination attempt this month. He blamed Ukrainian authorities and the CIA, but other analysts suggested infighting or falling out with his Russian handlers was a more likely cause.
Responding to the alleged incidents in Crimea, Putin also said it made no sense to have a “Normandy four” meeting in the current circumstances. The quartet of leaders from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany have met periodically to discuss the conflict in eastern Ukraine. A meeting had been mooted for the G20 summit in China next month.

A German study published in the medical journal JAMA Neurology found that seniors who regularly took proton-pump inhibitors like Nexium, Prilosec, and Prevacid were 44% more likely to end up with dementia. Proton-pump inhibitors, commonly used to decrease acid in the stomach, are used by more than 15 million people, according to NPR.
The study followed more than 73,000 elderly participants to track their use of the drug class and incidence of dementia, so it did not establish a cause-and-effect relationship. Prilosec is made by Procter & Gamble (pg), AstraZeneca makes Nexium, and Takeda Pharmaceuticals makes Prevacid.
In an editorial accompanying the study's publication this week, University of Pittsburgh's Lewis Kuller wrote: “Whether PPIs actually cause an increase in the risk of dementia is therefore an important question requiring further evaluation … This is a very important issue given the very high prevalence of pharmacological drugs' long-term use in elderly populations that have a very high risk of dementia.”
The study builds off previous findings that the drugs might increase the risk of heart disease and chronic kidney disease, NPR reported.
P&G said in a statement that Prilosec is a “safe and effective” treatment for heartburn, and that patients should discuss any concerns with their doctors. AstraZeneca spokeswoman Michele Meixell said in a statement that the pharmaceutical company was not consulted during the study and believes that its proton-pump inhibitor medications are all “generally safe and effective when used in accordance with the label.” Fortune has also reached out to Takeda for comment and will update this story if they respond.
Designed to balance and sustain the enlisted force as the Air Force continues to grow, the program allows Airmen on their second or later enlistments in healthier Air Force specialties to retrain into specialties with lower inventories to meet current and future mission needs.
“The enlisted retraining advisory on myPers is updated in real time and assists Airmen with identifying career fields with retraining-in quotas in their grade, or projected grade, if selected, that they might find interesting,” said Master Sgt. Kris Reece, Air Force Personnel Center Enlisted Skills Management Branch superintendent. “We advise potential applicants to check the retraining advisory and notes closely to avoid delays in the application process, particularly regarding eligibility.”
To apply for NCORP, Airmen must be on their second or subsequent enlistment, be a staff sergeant or staff sergeant-select through master sergeant and have a minimum five-skill level in their control AFSC or a three-skill level for those AFSCs where a five-level does not exist. Additionally, staff sergeants must have fewer than 12 years, and technical and master sergeants no more than 16 years of active service as of Sept. 30.
The Air Force Work Interest Navigator, available on the Retraining page on myPers, is a tool Airmen may use to identify potential career fields of interest by answering a series of questions about functional communities, job context and work activities.
“The AF-WIN tool creates a customized job-interest report from your responses and compares your interests to all entry-level AFSCs,” Reece said. “You'll still want to visit the enlisted retraining advisory because AF-WIN doesn't tell you if a career field is available or if you meet the eligibility qualifications.”
AFPC will host two active duty Enlisted Retraining webcasts for second term and career Airmen on Wed., Aug. 2, at 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Central Daylight Time. Airmen should use their e-mail Common Access Card certificate to authenticate and log in 10 minutes early to establish a good connection.
Retraining information is available and continuously updated on myPers. Click “Retraining” from the active-duty enlisted landing page. The online training advisory is listed under the “Tools” section. In addition, a live chat feature is available for Airmen on the First Term Airmen Retraining page. To chat live with a Total Force Service Center representative, go to the page and allow about 30 to 60 seconds for a representative to come online.
For more information about Air Force personnel programs, go to myPers. Individuals who do not have a myPers account can request one by following these instructions.

posted 10-14-1999 11:32 AM OK, I started this to see if you had the same things happen. Was there a scene when it looked like the film was getting off track and showing sprocket holes. Brad stayed clear but everything else was out of focus and could see sprocket holes. I think it was just the movie. What did anyone else see. It was kinda weird and gross in places. Don't think it will last too long. Keep those mops handy and install an airsickness bag on the back of the theatre chairs. Paul Konen

posted 10-14-1999 01:37 PM Were the sprocket holes clear or black? If they were clear, it sounds like the print was mispositioned in the gate of the projector, and then jumped back into place. If the sprocket holes are black, it sounds like the print film jumped off the sprocket in the printer, and then got back on. Did the film jump out of frame? Look at the print itself on a rewind. If the image shows what you saw on the screen, it is likely the print film jumped off the printer sprocket and back on again. Note that the lab prints the soundtracks and the picture as two separate originals on two separate sprockets, so only one is likely to be affected in this way. Jumping the printer sprocket would be a one-of-a-kind incident, and you can ask the lab for a new reel. ------------------

posted 10-14-1999 03:30 PM It was an effect. The same shot was also in the trailer. Nothing wrong with the equipment or print. I did find it nice that for once, the correct "4 perfs" was displayed. Seems every time there is an effect, it is technically wrong. Even that last Kodak ad had 6 perf film in it. Did anyone panic when Gremins 2 burned? On video it is a HORRIBLY fake video glitch, but in the theater that scene was the film jamming and burning in the gate.

There will be thousands of people who will now know what those are and will unfortunately never be able to watch a film again without seeing that distraction! No one ever notices the marks until they are pointed out. What a terrible thing to do.

posted 10-15-1999 03:05 PM Brad is so right when he points out the unkind act of showing people all about cue marks. Not long ago while visiting family in Peterborough, I bumped into an usher I knew back at the Drive-In, years before. "You bastard" he yelled, "since you showed me those circles on the film, I always see'em, can't ignore them." We settled old differences over a couple of beers while I explained the difference between flat and scope (and how he should demand a lower admission price for a flat movie). I imagine next time, he'll be carrying a baseball bat.

A quick introduction about Ray Blanchard. Blanchard studies sexual fetishes (paraphilias). He was mentored by Kurt Freund, who studied the psychosexual disorders of sex offenders. Blanchard decided to take the same lens used to study sex offenders and turn it on people on the transgender spectrum. He used some questionable research to conclude that most cross-dressers cross-dress for sexual reasons, and created a two-type theory of male-to-female transsexuality. The first type he calls homosexual transsexuals, actually straight trans women, and he theorizes the root cause of their transsexuality is that they were/are feminine gay men who want to have relationships with straight men. The other type he terms non-homosexual transsexuals, actually homosexual or bisexual trans women. He thinks these trans women have autogynephila, what he terms an “erotic target location error,” where instead of being attracted to women they are attracted to the idea of themselves as woman. The theory is bullshit and here is a critique of his theory and research by a psychologist. The interview:
“How the Psychiatrist Who Co-Wrote the Manual on Sex Talks About Sex”
Before I get to my analysis of the interview, a quote from Julia Serano's book, Whipping Girl.
It seems to me that the entire debate in academia over whether transsexuals are radical or conservative with regards to gender is founded on cissexual privilege. Because these scholars have not had to live with the reality of gender dissonance, they are afforded the luxury of rationalizing away subconscious sex, thus allowing them to project their own interests or biases onto trans people. Not surprisingly, the researchers' academic backgrounds seem to be the primary determinant as to what explanations for transsexuality they will posit. (p. 155)
Is it any surprise that Blanchard, a researcher in sexology, would create a theory that transsexuality is caused by disorders of sexuality?
The interview: “How the Psychiatrist Who Co-Wrote the Manual on Sex Talks About Sex”
First of all, about the introduction.
Dr. Ray Blanchard knows sex. He is handy with a penile plethysmograph, which he uses to measure a guy's penis to see if he's turned on.
The plethysmograph has only ever been validated as a measure of actual sexual attraction for pedophilia. I can find no reference to a study that shows the results of the plesthysmograph to be an accurate measure of sexual arousal in other contexts. It is capable of measuring very small partial erections, and I suspect that towards the lower limit of its range there is no strong correlation with significant sexual preferences. Kurt Freund invented it as a test for homosexuality for the Czechoslovakia army to prevent homosexuals from joining the army. This device has a problematic history, and its utility is based on distrust of the research participants. I think the confrontational nature of the test should give psychologists pause in using it as a research tool. Does any psychological research use a lie detector?
The criteria arrived at by Blanchard and the rest of the APA's task force of shrinks could determine whether an eight-year-old girl who pees standing up is labeled with gender dysphoria and given hormones[.]
This shows a complete lack of understanding of how gender transition works for children. No one is giving hormones to 8-year-old kids. No one is giving hormones to 12-year-old kids either. Lupron, a puberty-blocker, is used for several years for children who may be trans to allow them to mature enough to make the decision of whether to medically transition. That the interviewer doesn't understand this is not a good sign for the interview.
Motherboard: When does a paraphilia become a disorder? Blanchard: There are two ways by which a paraphilia could be converted into a paraphilic disorder: the individual is distressed by their desires, or they are acting in a way that is noxious to people.[…] So if someone cross dresses and they are cool with it, then they don't have a disorder, correct? Yes, under my proposal you can now be a happy transvestite, or you can have a transvestic disorder.
I'm not going to get too much into the specifics of what is wrong with his stance on paraphilias, but see this article for how this resembles the hold-over homosexuality diagnosis in the DSM-III, where you could be a happy homosexual, or an unhappy homosexual suffering from ego-dystonic homosexuality.
Some trans activists object to the inclusion of transvestic disorder in the DSM because they feel it pathologizes gender non-conformity. How do you respond to these criticisms? To say that transvestic disorder pathologizes all trans people is rhetoric with no logic behind it whatsoever. If you actually open the DSM-4, it's very explicit that it applies to people who get sexually excited by dressing in women's clothes. […]
This is just eliding the truth. The DSM-4 criterion A for diagnosing transvestitic fethisism:
Over a period of at least 6 months, in a heterosexual male, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving cross-dressing.
The text is grammatically ambiguous on whether the behaviors have to be sexually arousing (sexually arousing sexual urges doesn't make a whole lot of sense.), and notice the promotion of gender conformity that only straight men can be diagnosed. However, the DSM-5 puts the insanity of the transvestic disorder right out there by eliminating all categories of sexual orientation and gender, so anyone wears clothes not stereotyped as being for their gender can potentially be diagnosed with transvestic disorder.
Is the objection based on the idea that it fetishizes gender non-conformity? Some activists are trying to sell the public on the idea, “We really are women where it matters–in our brains–and women don't get sexually excited when they put on their bras and panties, so we don't either.” And for a lot of them that's just a lie.
And here he conflates transsexual women with cross-dressers because:
So you don't see a male-to-female transsexual as being female? I think that a transsexual should be considered as whatever their biological sex is plus the fact that they are transsexuals. That's how you would do research on them. There's no other way to do it. If you're interested in whether the brains of transsexuals are different in some way, you're interested in seeing if they differ from other individuals with the same biological sex.
Holy cissexism batman. All he cares about is how trans women, who he sees as men with transsexuality, are different from men without transsexuality. He doesn't actually care about us as anything but a deviation. And he doesn't separate his scientific perspective on us from how he sees us as people. This is what is wrong with Blanchard, he doesn't see people, he sees specimens he can dissect. Notice how he said brains, not minds. He is a psychiatrist, not a neuroscientist. By saying he studies the brain implies that he is engaged in research with a physical object that can be objectively observed and analyzed. This viewpoint is directly used to justify doing none of his research with cis female control groups. (If he had, he would have found that a lot of cis women would meet the survey criteria for autogynephilia he used (Moser, 2009).)
Also, autogynephilia has never been shown to be a cause of transsexuality. Blanchard's own research found that 15% of his “homosexual transsexual” group had autogynephilia.
So in a way psychiatric research is inherently gender normative? I would say medical research is inherently gender normative.
What does this even mean?
Do you think that classifying transgender people as having a disorder does contribute to stigma against the trans community? No. I mean how many people who make a joke about trannies consult the DSM first?
Liar! The U.S. military bans trans people from military service on the basis that they are labeled as having a mental disorder and the GID diagnosis has been used as an argument in court cases such as child custody.
Do you think that transgender identity might get to the point where homosexuality is now, where it is considered offensive and inaccurate to call it a disorder? I think there are some glaring differences between acceptance of transsexualism and acceptance of homosexuality. Let's say that a friend comes to you and says she's a lesbian, you aren't seeing your friend performing cunnilingus on her girlfriend. All this requires is acceptance of what you don't have to see. With transsexualism, if a friend comes to you and says I feel like I'm actually a woman, and starting tomorrow I'm going to be showing up wearing dresses, this is not happening offstage, you are now part of their movie.
About homosexuality, he is ignoring that to be accepting of it means being accepting that their significant other is the same-sex and not doing things like banning a lesbian couple from the prom, or banning out homosexual people from the military, or denying them the right to marry and the benefits of marriage. How different is it if a male friend introduces you to a man and tells you that he is his husband, and they are going to be showing up at social events together, and people need to accept that they are a married couple. Blanchard is in effect saying that he is okay with homosexual people as long as they don't flaunt it.
Also, great job artificializing our lives as a movie. Because portraying transsexuals as artificial is not at all uncommon as an element of transphobia.
So why do you keep using [the word “normal”]? I guess because I think it's a perfectly good concept. I don't aggravate people if I don't have to, but I'm not going to say that there is no gold standard of what sexual behavior's purpose is. And what is that? I would say if one could start from scratch, ignore all the history of removing homosexuality from the DSM, normal sexuality is whatever is related to reproduction. Now you have everything else. I would distinguish between behaviors which are anomalous and benign vs. those that are malignant. So homosexuality would be not normal but benign. Whereas something like serious dangerous sadism would be a malignant variation.
As I was saying about seeing people as specimens. Also, the argument about normal sexuality being related to procreation is exactly the same argument made by opponents of same-sex marriage.
So, in your point of view, science rules. Scientific inquiry is the first priority, whatever it might mean for social justice? If you put it in abstract terms, it makes me sound vaguely lunatic.
Yes, because he is obsessed with reducing people to objects of study, and all he sees is an abnormality to understand. His refusal to recognize his research participants as whole human beings is what makes his science bad. The negative response to his work because it is not politically incorrect but just incorrect is viewed as self-affirmation that he is doing objective science, when he has actually done very little in the way of good science.
Neal at Sun King Brewing reached out to us in regards to problems Indiana craft brewers are facing, as well as a collaboration between them and 3 Floyds, born out of trying to solve these legislation issues. We plan on following up with 3 Floyds on this matter, and hope when the time is right, you will join us in an effort to support this important cause. Cheers!
As you may or may not know, Sun King's staff recently traveled to Munster to make a collaborative brew with 3 Floyds. Since both breweries make celebrated American pale ales (Alpha King and Osiris, respectively), 3 Floyds owner Nick Floyd, head brewer Barnaby Struve, and Sun King brewer/owners Clay Robinson and Dave Colt quickly agreed on a recipe for 3 Kings Pale Ale, a specialty beer that will be tapped in Munster and Indianapolis in April to draw attention to our lobbying efforts. Lobbying efforts for what you say? Funny you should ask…
According to Indiana law, a brewer cannot operate a tasting room, brew pub, or self-distribute its product if it produces more than 20,000 barrels (approximately 40,000 kegs) a year. With 3 Floyds on pace to exceed 20,000 barrels this year, the brewery is faced with either shutting down its brewpub or it's brewing operation or moving their entire enterprise to Illinois. Sun King is on pace to hit the 20,000 barrel limits in 2013, when it will either have to stopped self-distributing its product or curtail growth permanently.
Businesses like 3 Floyds and Sun King have deep ties in their respective communities and are working hard to create a bright future for Indiana.
Respectfully,
Neal Taflinger
Communications Director, Sun King Brewing Co.
The German government is planning a host of new security measures in the wake of a few violent incidents in Würzburg, Ansbach and Munich. The measures include an increase in police personnel, a central crime unit for pursuing crime on the internet, easier deportation for migrants who have committed crimes, and depriving Germans who join foreign "terror militias" of their citizenship.
"I am convinced that these proposals will increase security quickly," Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told reporters in a special press conference in Berlin on Thursday, before adding that all the proposals could be implemented in this legislative period, which ends next fall.
One of the proposals was designed to make it easier to deport migrants guilty of crimes - or even potentially guilty. As part of Germany's Residence Act for foreign nationals, "endangering public safety" will be introduced as a reason to deport someone. "In this way, we will in future increasingly use the instrument of deportation for foreign criminals and people likely to pose a threat," the minister said in his statement.
On top of that, a new task force will be created to concentrate on speeding up individual cases of foreign criminals who are in line for deportation. A pilot project along such lines has already been set up in North Rhine-Westphalia.
A migrant blew himself up with a homemade bomb in Ansbach in late July
New cyberinvestigation unit
De Maiziere insisted that security forces had been continually strengthened throughout his tenure, but that new measures were still necessary. Apart from a 2 billion euro ($2.2 billion) increase in funding for the federal police, de Maiziere said that "technical capabilities" for "cyberinvestigation" would be gathered in a new joint unit - the "Central Office for Information in the Security Sphere" (ZITiS).
ZITiS will support security forces by developing "methods, products and strategies to fight criminality and terrorism on the internet." The new office will be set up at the beginning of next year and will eventually include 400 officials, including investigators specializing in trawling the so-called "darknet" for illegal weapons trading and terrorist communication. The teenager who shot nine people in a Munich shopping mall on July 22 is believed to have bought his gun illegally via the darknet.
De Maiziere also announced an increase and upgrade of video surveillance technology in German railways stations.
Patient-doctor confidentiality
De Maiziere also tried to diffuse the row that has developed in the last few days over his alleged plans to weaken doctors' obligation to patient confidentiality - potentially forcing doctors to report mental health patients who might pose a threat to public safety. The German Medical Association had preemptively warned against any such plans on Wednesday.
The minister said he was "aware of the sensitivity" of this problem and for that reason proposed a meeting between the government and the association's president, Frank Ulrich Montgomery, to discuss "how we can preserve the duty of confidentiality while reducing the risks for citizens as much as possible."
Similarly, de Maiziere sought a compromise on the row over dual nationality, another issue where state interior ministers (two of whom are caught in election campaigns) have been pushing for an outright ban. Instead, de Maiziere said that German citizens who fight for "terror militias" abroad would be deprived of their citizenship. On top of that, "sympathetic promotion" of terrorism would also become a crime.
Germany's new security plans also involve better prevention, with integration teachers being trained to deal with war trauma. In addition, refugees will be offered better opportunities to report signs of psychological changes or signs of radicalization among their peers.
'Slap in the face for populist agitators'
De Maiziere resisted calls from state interior ministers - and also members of his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) - to ban the face-covering Islamic dress the burqa in Germany. He called the idea "constitutionally problematic" and added: "You can't ban everything you oppose, and I oppose the wearing of a burqa."
Volker Beck accused the government of 'despairing politicking'
Sigmar Gabriel, vice chancellor and head of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), junior partner in Germany's governing coalition, showed satisfaction with the minister's plan, a day after warning the CDU against knee-jerk reactions.
"The SPD is ready to talk about anything that will contribute to heightening security," he told the "Funke Mediengruppe" newspaper group. "But we're not available for populist rush jobs."
He added that de Maiziere's refusal to entertain blanket bans on the burqa and dual nationality had been a "slap in the face" for the "agitators" of the CDU.
Opposition politicians were less enthusiastic about the tightening of laws governing foreign nationals in Germany. Volker Beck said de Maiziere's plans would do little to increase security. In a statement, the Green party's migration spokesman dismissed threatening jihadists with losing their German citizenship as "despairing politicking."
And Beck added that speeding up deportations was not as easy as de Maiziere suggested, not least because many refugees do not have valid papers. "The fact is that not a few embassies simply refuse to issue passports for those affected," he said. "Accusations and tightening residency laws makes precious little difference. We'd be better advised to give all people whose deportations are impossible for actual reasons the prospect of staying."
Five years have passed since the first 802.11n devices implementing a draft of the now-finalized specification hit the market. Over the years 802.11n support has become ubiquitous in the industry. Everything from smartphones to high-end notebooks support the standard. Even low cost products like the $99 Apple TV or $49 Roku LT ship with 802.11n support. With real world transfer speeds ranging from 30Mbps at the low end to 150Mbps at the high end, 802.11n is simply too slow to quickly move large files. It wasn't too long ago that 100MB/s was reserved for high-end hard drives in PCs. Today, with SSDs capable of sustaining transfers of over 500MB/s, the bottleneck in many wireless homes is increasingly becoming WiFi.
The IEEE has been working on the specification for the fifth generation of WiFi: 802.11ac. Today that spec is in its draft stages and is expected to be finalized by the end of 2012 or beginning of 2013. The first 802.11ac chipsets have already been announced by Broadcom , with the first devices (routers, USB dongles, PCIe cards and OEM systems) shipping very shortly. Broadcom expects that the final version of the 802.11ac spec will be only marginally different from the current draft and any changes it expects to be able to address in software.
If you're wondering where the 'ac' suffix comes from, the IEEE simply ran out of single letters. Every technical paper released by the IEEE for the 802.11 project is assigned a letter. The vast majority of these papers aren't broad, networking standards which is why you never hear about them. The ones that end up as standards gain popularity but the nomenclature is purely linear use of the alphabet.
Note that 802.11ac is not the same as WiGig (802.11ad), which is a 60GHz interface with very short range. WiGig is more of an in-room technology while 802.11ac is a true WiFi successor.
5GHz Only, 256QAM
Although 802.11n can operate in either 2.4GHz or 5GHz modes, 802.11ac is exclusively a 5GHz interface. While there are building propagation tradeoffs made at higher frequencies, the benefit of being 5GHz-only is a significant reduction in interference. While the 2.4GHz spectrum is littered with interference from other devices, there's much less crowding at 5GHz where there's much more available spectrum. If you've ever been in an densely populated environment and tried to tether your notebook to your smartphone over 2.4GHz WiFi (anywhere in Manhattan) you'll appreciate 802.11ac's 5GHz exclusivity.
Each 802.11ac channel is wider than any previous WiFi standard at 80MHz with optional support for 160MHz (40MHz is the widest you can get on 802.11n, although 20MHz is still not uncommon).
Spectral efficiency is also improved on 802.11ac compared to 802.11n. While the latter used a maximum of 64QAM, ac supports 256QAM. Brian provided a great explanation of QAM encoding here
64QAM (left) vs. 256QAM (right), Image Courtesy Wikipedia
802.11ac 3x3: Up to 1.3Gbps, Wirelessly
The 4x increase in data encoded on a carrier coupled with a doubling of channel bandwidth are together responsible for the increase in bandwidth per stream in 802.11ac. The maximum bandwidth per spatial stream in 802.11n was 150Mbps (40MHz channels, short guard interval), while in 802.11ac that value jumps to 433Mbps.
Smartphones and tablets will still likely use a 1x1:1 configuration (1 transmit, 1 receive antenna with 1 spatial stream), however high-end notebooks will likely use 3x3:3 configurations similar to what they have today with 802.11n. In these cases you're looking at a peak theoretical bandwidth of 1.3Gbps. Even with smartphones/tablets implementing 1x1:1 802.11ac (433Mbps), there's a huge improvement over the 72Mbps PHY rate on the best of the best today.
As we've seen with 802.11n, real world transfer rates are often 1/3 - 1/2 of the negotiated interface rate. Even if that continues to be the case, we're still looking at a tangible increase in bandwidth over 802.11n.
There is a chance we'll see even better efficiency out of 802.11ac however. Although closed loop beam forming was a supported feature in the 802.11n spec, it wasn't widely used. In 802.11ac, we'll see closed loop beam forming from many high-end, multi-antenna access points. Combined with information from client devices, 802.11ac APs will be able to adjust the phase of output signals to increase received signal strength on the client without increase output power on the AP.
802.11ac also supports more spatial streams (8) than 802.11n although the first solutions will still use a maximum of three.
Power Consumption
Given an infinitely sized data set, 802.11ac will draw more power than 802.11n. The specification is simply more complex and supporting things like wider channels requires more power. Thankfully, data sets are not infinitely sized. And for the near term, files and web pages sizes shouldn't increase tremendously. Although 802.11ac chipsets built on the same process as their n counterparts will draw more active power, their higher performance should allow the WiFi stack to go to sleep sooner. Idle power in a well designed 802.11ac solution should be comparable to 802.11n, and a race to sleep generally results in improved average power.
When faced with the prospects of significant improvements in download speeds, users tend to do more with their devices. If you're transacting more data over 802.11ac than you did via 802.11n, you can expect to see greater power consumption. If you're doing the same workload, it's possible that you'll see the same or better power consumption on 802.11ac compared to n thanks to the chipset being able to go to sleep quicker. All of this depends on the scenario, something we'll obviously test once we have the first ac devices in house.
The first 802.11ac chipsets will be built on 40/45nm processes, similar to the most recent 802.11n chipsets. The inevitable move to 28/32nm will further reduce power to help offset any changes in usage models over time, although I wouldn't expect that transition to happen for a little while given the cost of 28nm wafers today.
Backwards Compatibility
Similar to current 802.11n devices, ac chipsets will support fallback to older 802.11 standards depending on available networks and speeds. Chipsets are expected to prefer 5GHz ac by default, but then fall back to 802.11n speeds when appropriate. Most chipsets will likely be dual-band, so in the event that 5GHz isn't sustainable (or available) they will fall back to 2.4GHz 802.11n, then g and b.
Final Words
We're still a couple of years away from widespread adoption of 802.11ac, but the first products will be arriving shortly (many will likely debut at CES next week). We often write about advancements in CPU, GPU and SoC technologies, but it's important to see progress in network interfaces as well. Balanced systems are important and 802.11ac should help usher in the next-generation of usage models.
We'll enjoy the benefits of less interference as 802.11ac is a 5GHz-only standard as well as much higher performance thanks to wider channels and 256QAM encoding. Transmit power efficiency should also go up if we get wireless APs with sophisticated beam forming support. All of this will work together to deliver many times the performance we currently get over 802.11n without significant downsides.
WiFi has proven to be extremely important in the mobile revolution that has taken place over the past 10 years. While we'll undoubtedly see even faster wired interfaces (10GbE on the desktop anyone?), 802.11ac will be a significant part of the next phase of mobile evolution.

When news broke last month on the Department of Justice's plans to indict Sen. Robert Menendez on criminal corruption charges, the New Jersey Democrat signaled he would fight.
“I'm not going anywhere,” he said.
The test of Menendez's will begins today, as a federal indictment charges the senator with 14 counts, including bribery, conspiracy and wire fraud.
It's certain to add considerably to the already massive legal bills Menendez has racked up — and that political patrons are helping pay off. From early 2013 through the end of 2014, Menendez reported spending more than $1.2 million on legal fees, using a combination of cash from his campaign committee, political action committee and a legal defense fund, according to a Center for Public Integrity analysis of federal documents.
It was early in 2013 when Menendez's relationship with Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, a friend and campaign donor, set off a series of investigations that led to today's indictment.
New filings are due this month that will no doubt reflect additional large payments to Menendez's legal team, which now includes prominent white collar defense lawyer Abbe Lowell of Chadbourne & Parke LLP.
Lowell has represented a long list of prominent politicians from both parties. They include former Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev.; former Democratic senator and presidential candidate John Edwards; and another Democratic senator from New Jersey, former Sen. Robert Torricelli, who faced allegations of corruption. Menendez's committees reported paying Chadbourne more than $160,000 during the fourth quarter of 2014.
The bulk of Menendez's legal fees have so far been paid to other firms, including Perkins Coie LLP, where Menendez is represented by Marc Elias, the chairman of the political law practice.
Menendez's legal fund and political committees paid Perkins Coie more than $560,000 during 2013 and 2014.
Elias has represented long list of Democratic clients, from Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to, reportedly, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
In addition, Menendez's legal fund has paid McDermott Will & Emery LLP roughly $780,000 over the same period, nearly $56,000 to Brand Law Group, and about $157,000 to Coburn and Greenbaum PLLC.
So far, donors have been willing to ante up to Menendez's legal defense fund: Menendez has raised about $866,000 since it formed two years ago. About three-quarters of this haul has come in $10,000 increments, the maximum annual contribution allowed. He's spent more than $760,000 of it, almost all on legal fees.
Among the biggest donors to Menendez's legal defense fund: Hoboken developer David Barry.
Barry gave the maximum $10,000 in 2014. Three other donors with the same last name using the address of his business, Ironstate Development, gave $10,000 each, as did another executive at Ironstate, Gregory Russo.
Marc Lasry, the president and chief executive officer of hedge fund Avenue Capital Group, gave $10,000, and his firm appears to have given $10,000 as well. Michael Kempner, the president of New Jersey-based public relations and lobbying firm MWW Group, gave $10,000, and so did his wife, Jacqueline Kempner.
Eighty-three of the 150 contributors to Menendez's legal fund list New Jersey addresses. Another 20 list addresses in New York.
“As a top fundraiser, I'm sure he's made a lot of contacts … with people who will want to continue to support him,” said Lawrence Noble, a senior counsel at the Campaign Legal Center and a former general counsel of the Federal Election Commission. “The question is going to be, as the case goes along, how much of a viable candidate he remains and what it does to his fundraising.”
Added Kenneth Gross, who leads the political law practice at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher, & Flom: “This is going to be an expensive defense … the senator has already incurred significant bills, and this could go on for quite some time through a legal process and beyond.”
Menendez, a former Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chairman, is known as a strong fundraiser and doesn't face re-election until 2018.
In the meantime, it's hard to say how high Menendez's legal bills could go.
Only 11 senators have been indicted while in office, according to the Senate Historical Office, and only one so far this century: the late Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.
Stevens was convicted in 2008, but in 2009, a federal judge dismissed the conviction, citing prosecutorial misconduct.
In sudden and dramatic fashion, Anderson Silva found himself hospitalized with severe back pain following a workout on Monday evening.
Silva, who was training at XGym in Rio de Janeiro, noticed severe back pain following his workout, collapsed to the floor in pain, and desperately revealed that he could no longer feel his legs. This continued for several minutes before he was placed on a stretcher and transported to the hospital for evaluation.
Following a variety of tests, including MRI, CT scans, and blood tests, it was confirmed that Silva had suffered a bout of lumbago, which is a pain in the lower back that impacts 40% of people at one point in their lives. He was eventually discharged on Tuesday morning.
Combate.com confirmed the news (via sportv.globo).
The dramatic turn on Monday will not impact the highly anticipated UFC 183 main event between Silva and Nick Diaz. According to the medical director of the Brazilian MMA Athletic Commission (CABMMA), Silva's lumbago is nothing to be alarmed about.
"It really was a shock," Dr. Tannure said. "He felt a sharp pain because of contracture. It hurts a lot, really, but it will not change anything in terms of training. The problem he had justified the pain, but it will not result in a withdrawal or cancellation of the fight."

Who from history would you like to invite to lunch? A question we've all pondered
in an idle moment, and for me it's Thomas Hobbes author of Leviathan, 1651. Having just joined Labour as a 70th birthday treat for myself the appointment has become urgent. Hobbes was a rottweiler, but I'm finding the party more like a goldfish. Why are we not proposing to nationalise some of our egregious companies – at least one bank and one power firm – to show what can be done without prima donna management and astronomical salaries? What is to be done about the vile pay inequalities. Where does it say we are going to break the spines of the people who have plundered and wrecked our economy?
Nasty, brutish and short was how Hobbes described life without the rule of law and it's possible that lunch might share some of those aspects too. For a start it will be at 11am: we'll be having fish, probably whiting, but absolutely no wine as on the rare occasions when he drank he made sure he took in enough ‘to have the benefit of vomiting by which neither his wit was disturbed nor his stomach oppressed'. So reported the garrulous and meandering John Aubrey who also holds out the unpleasing prospect of Mr Hobbes' ‘greatest trouble', which was ‘to keep off the flies from pitching on the baldness' of his head.
Hobbes was accused of being an atheistical cynic with a falsely pessimistic view of humanity as irredeemably selfish, distrustful and violent. Then as now, we all like to think we're not like that – Don't we help others? Are we not basically altruistic? Do we not trust one another?
Hobbes had a ready response:
‘Let him therefore consider with himselfe … when going to sleep he locks his dores; when even in his house he locks his chests; and this when he knows there bee lawes and publicke officers, armed, to revenge all injuries shall bee done to him; what opinion he has of his fellow citizens when he locks his dores; and of his children and servants when he locks his chests. Does he not there as much accuse mankind, by his actions, as I do by my words?'
Once, having been seen by a divine to give money to a beggar, he was teased about his reasons – did this not undermine his cynical view of human passions? was it not evidence of his unselfish obedience to Christ's command? ‘No', said he, ‘for I was in pain to consider the miserable condition of the old man; and now my alms, giving him some relief, doth also ease me'. Would he be interested to learn that the managers of many of our charities pay themselves six-figure salaries, and justify themselves using exactly the same excuses used by bankers? Would he want to ask our modern pacifists about their policy in respect of door locks, car locks, PIN numbers and passwords? And would he be surprised at the responses he got? I think not.
His philosophy is as eye-opening in our times as it was controversial in his, though we no longer believe as he did that applying it to political problems will settle them for good. Hobbes starts from two basic simple ideas: that we are all basically equal, and that our supreme motivation is our self-preservation and right to life.
He argues first that we are all pretty much equal in most respects – from physical strength to basic common sense, or wisdom in the ways of the world. Of course, some have more knowledge or intelligence than others, just as some have more physical skill and courage, but, taken all together, the differences are not so great that anyone can claim any right or benefit that another cannot claim too, and with equal justice. Don't we all feel without hesitation that we have the right to remark on the suitability, stupidity or nastiness of our rulers? Do we not blithely pass comment on the professionalism and expertise of almost every specialist we hear of – whether high court judges, town-planners, artists or surgeons? Are we not all sure we are as commonsensical and street-smart as anyone else?
Hobbes recognises that this notion will be repugnant to those who believe themselves socially or intellectually superior. Such people were as prevalent in the 17th century as they are now. Then there were aristocrats aplenty, land-owners and well-padded clergy. Nowadays, among others with a similar sense of entitlement, we have the finance industry, rude, greedy, delusional – and if asked to confront the harm they have caused, indignant, wounded, deaf to reason and impervious to evidence. What they have in common with their hapless victims (and this is Hobbes' important point) is confidence in their own judgement, and this fact, Hobbes says, proves we are all more or less cognitively equal: “for there is not ordinarily a greater sign of the equal distribution of anything than that every man is contented with his share”.
No one in politics speaks of equality now. Let's shout it. Let's promise a start on fair shares using taxation to roll back the vast inequalities that have come upon us. It is government's duty to rectify inequalities and disadvantages that are natural – whether caused by sickness, ill-parenting, or flooding. And let's not listen any more to the usual excuses about needing to attract international talent. We attract plenty without offering anything very much. Britain is one of the best places to live: if we can get builders, teachers and nurses from overseas why not bankers? A banker's job is to lend money at interest and pay interest on deposits and to manage future insurance contracts to steady the price of vital raw materials: about as challenging as running an ice cream van.
Having established his strikingly modern notion of equality Hobbes then asserts that we all have an equal fundamental right to life – to the supreme law of self-preservation – the foundation upon which all other rights are built. For this we need peace and Hobbes offers this precept: ‘That every man, ought to endeavour peace, as farre as he has hope of obtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek and use all helps and advantages of warre'. The aim of war is to achieve a situation where we are all prepared to be content with as much liberty against others as we will allow others against ourselves: do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
It is Hobbes' thoughts on war that have proved so prophetic. Here he is describing what we think of as a twentieth century phenomenon – cold war:
‘For warre consisteth not in Battell onely, or the act of fighting; but in tract of time, wherein the will to contend by battell is sufficiently known: and therefore the notion of time is to be considered in the nature of warre; as it is in the nature of weather. For the nature of foule weather lyeth not in a showre or two of rain; but in an inclination thereto of many dayes together; so the nature of warre consisteth not in actuall fighting; but in the known disposition thereto, during all the time there is no assurance to the contrary. All other time is peace.'
Hobbes might say we are at war now and not just with terrorists, who, when not involved in ‘actuall fighting' have a ‘known disposition thereto'. He might be interested in the UK Foreign Office website where at any one time three or four dozen countries are active in war or something so close to it as to make travel dangerous. And then there are the meetings of the UN where conflicts regularly prevent action to relieve abuses. He had no faith in democratic methods or conferences as a means of keeping the peace. Unlike modern states which look back respectfully to Cleisthenes' Athenian democracy (508-322BC) – or claim to do – Hobbes pointed out that it was an age of continual warfare, demagoguery and failure, for ‘No bond is more easily broken than a man's word ‘.
He would not be surprised to learn that despite international treaties the UN has only once successfully carried out its duty when it freed Kuwait in 1991.
He might note that the causes of war that he listed, both civil and international, remain the same: competition for scarce goods or trade; diffidence, that is the defensive fear that if we do not strike first we will be attacked; and glory, the satisfying of pride in conflict. Hobbes is contemptuous of glory as a motive and expands on it thus:
Trifles, as a word, a smile, a different opinion, and any other sign of undervalue, either direct in their persons, or by reflexion in their kindred, their friends, their nation, their profession, or their name.
In modern parlance he is describing ideologies and nationalism, and the racist and religious hatreds that are their offspring. Hobbes' solution to the quest for peace remains as controversial as it is unattainable and volumes have been devoted to its interpretation and construal. Put simply, he proposed that, since we can't be trusted, we must all permanently surrender our rights to a sovereign power to keep us in order: ‘a visible power to keep men in awe, and tye them by feare of punishment to the performance of their covenants and observation of laws'. He had in mind a benevolent but powerful monarch, not a person or group which might be unseated by popular protest.
I cannot guess what he would have to say about our modern quasi democratic means of keeping the peace, however imperfectly and certainly not universally. You could argue, though not with total confidence, that in recent times, unlike the Atheneans, some western peoples, when given the option, vote to avoid wars. Some, notably in 1914 and 1939, did not, forcing others, who wished to preserve their own peace, ‘to use all the helps and advantages of warre'. And what about internal peace? Hobbes pointed out the need for firm rule but is that now enough? It is certainly necessary, but is it sufficient? Hobbes' supreme law of self-preservation and the right to life looks different now from in his time. We need police as much as he did, but for the right to life we also need (and more importantly we expect and demand) healthcare that was not imaginable in the seventeeth century. The World Health Organisation's ranking of healthcare that famously has France at the top (Britain is number 18) is illuminating when you get more than halfway down: some examples: Egypt, Libya, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, North Korea. Perhaps I might persuade Hobbes that we should be sending, not the RAF, but an NHS taskforce to bring peace to these turbulent countries.
Here is Hobbes on what happens when even basic order is absent: a horrifying ‘State of Nature' as he termed it:
‘In such a condition there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth, no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodius building; no instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continuall feare and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short.'
Hobbes might be surprised, and certainly sorrowful, to find that 350 years after he wrote it, that paragraph still describes the condition under which so many people of the earth still live.
Well, that's lunch over. It's always a mistake on these occasions to invite more than one person from history as they naturally won't want to listen to you. But now, I do want to introduce another person who I hope Hobbes will agree constitutes an empirical test of his basic tenet – that we prize our own survival above all else in all circumstances. The German psychiatrist Viktor Frankl was imprisoned in Auschwitz, survived, and afterwards wrote a low-key account of day-to-day life in that hellhole. His time there began relatively well. Learning that he was a psychiatrist, an SS chief asked him for advice ‘for his friend' who suffered panic attacks in open spaces. Frankl offered some tips and was rewarded by a marginally less onerous work regime. (We are unable to enjoy the grim humour of contemplating an SS officer handicapped in his search for lebensraum by agoraphobia.)
Frankle describes in a matter of fact way how many prisoners used whatever means they could to get someone else taken the gas chambers in their place, and he cautions against seeing survivors like him as simple heroes. He gives a Hobbesian, and also perhaps a natural-selection, explanation of why he lived and others died. There was a self-preservation process at work amongst the prisoners with only those able to survive who had lost all scruples in the fight for existence:
They were prepared to use every means, honest and otherwise, even brutal force, theft, and betrayal of their friends, in order to save themselves. We who have come back, by the aid of many lucky chances or miracles, whatever one may choose to call them, we know: the best of us did not return.
The best of us did not return. However, Frankl was given the chance to escape Germany in 1939 when he was offered a visa for America. He declined because he could not take his parents with him: self-preservation? By a horrible irony they, his wife and all his family save one sister perished. What have you to say to that Mr Hobbes?
It's time to say goodbye. Fittingly, for a philosopher of war, he was born on 5 April 1588, his mother allegedly frightened into labour by the prospect of invasion by the Spanish Armada. Waggishly, he wanted his gravestone to be marked: Here is the true philosopher's stone – but it was not to be. We don't need a gravestone to remind us of Hobbes. His works have never been out of print and, to paraphrase what is said of another seventeenth century genius, if you want to know what his works were about, look around you.
ABOUT THE AUTHOR.
Michael McManus is recently retired from a teaching career which ranged from teenage tearaways excluded from schools, through post-grad, teacher-training, to organising PTSD courses for those trying to do something positive among the endless conflicts in the Middle East. As a change from academic publishing, I'm just completing a collection of short stories with philosophical lessons attached which I'm going to self-publish in three volumes this spring. The first two titles will be: St Thomas Aquinas Joins Islamic State; and, The Friedrich Nietzsche Weight-loss Plan.
PRINCETON, NJ -- Gallup's landmark study of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Americans finds that 44% identify as Democratic, 43% as independent, and 13% as Republican. That compares to 32% of non-LGBT Americans who identify as Democratic, 39% as independent, and 30% as Republican.
These results are based on the largest analysis of the LGBT community in the U.S. on record, consisting of 121,290 Gallup Daily tracking interviews conducted between June 1 and Sept. 30, 2012. Respondents were asked in each survey if they personally identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. Overall, 3.4% of Americans said "yes."
While these results confirm that many in the LGBT community initially identify their partisanship as independent, many of these independents lean toward Democratic identity. The combined measure, which takes into account leaned party identification, shows that 65% of LGBT Americans identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, while 21% identify with or lean toward the Republican, leaving 13% as "pure" independents who do not lean one way or the other. Among the overall U.S. population, 44% identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, while 42% identify with or lean toward the Republican. Twelve percent are pure independents.
One in Five LGBT Americans Are Conservative
While 45% of LGBT individuals describe their political views as liberal or very liberal, one in five (20%) describe themselves as conservative or very conservative. Among non-LGBT Americans, 23% say they are liberal, and two in five (39%) say they are conservative. LGBT and non-LGBT individuals are almost equally likely to think of themselves as moderate (35% and 38%, respectively).
LGBT Supporters Strongly Prefer Obama for President
Because of the relatively small percentage of the population who identify as LGBT, it is not possible to track their voting preferences on a daily or weekly basis. However, the voting preferences of LGBT Americans across the broad June-September sample provide an opportunity to look at the general voting patterns of this group in the 2012 election cycle.
Given the strong Democratic tilt of the LGBT population, it is not surprising that registered voter preferences of LGBT Americans tilt strongly -- but not monolithically -- toward Barack Obama. Specifically, 71% of LGBT Americans who are registered voters support Obama, while 22% support Mitt Romney.
From June to September, non-LGBT registered voters preferred Romney to Obama by one percentage point, 47% to 46%. Overall, among all registered voters, Obama was slightly ahead of Romney (47% to 45%) during the same period, supporting the argument that in such a close election, the highly Democratic vote of the LGBT population -- although a small percentage of the overall electorate -- could be enough to swing the election toward Obama.
These basic results are generally consistent with exit polls suggesting LGBT individuals historically support Democratic presidential candidates. Exit polling from the 2008 presidential election, for example, showed that 70% of LGBT individuals voted for Obama, while 27% supported Sen. John McCain. In 2004, exit polls showed that Democratic Sen. John Kerry received 77% of the LGBT vote, compared with 23% for President George. W. Bush. Democratic candidate Al Gore received 71% of the LGBT vote in 2000. Democrat Bill Clinton garnered 72% of the LGBT vote in 1992 and 66% in 1996. Gallup's data show that the 2012 voting patterns of LGBT Americans are likely to reflect the same general tendencies evident in previous elections.
LGBT Americans Slightly Less Likely to Be Registered to Vote
LGBT Americans are slightly less likely than their non-LGBT counterparts to say that they are registered and that they intend to vote. About three-fourths of LGBT individuals (74%) say they are registered or plan to register to vote, compared with 80% of non-LGBT men and women.
Gallup asks voters to rank their intent to vote on a scale from 1 to 10, with "1" being certainty that they will not vote and "10" being certainty that they will vote. LGBT Americans are slightly less certain that they will definitely vote compared with non-LGBT individuals (75% vs. 81%, respectively).
Demographics of LGBT Voter Preferences Similar to the Overall Population's
The overall demographic patterns that are associated with the general population's preferences for Obama and Romney are also apparent within the LGBT population. LGBT Americans who support Romney tends to be older, white, more religious, and more likely to be married.
More specifically:
Romney's LGBT supporters are nearly twice as likely as Obama's LGBT supporters to be seniors aged 65 or older (19% vs. 10%, respectively).
Nearly nine in 10 LGBT Romney supporters (87%) are white, compared with two-thirds of LGBT Obama supporters (66%).
Nearly two-thirds of LGBT Romney supporters (63%) say that religion is important to them, and more than 45% say that they attend a church, synagogue, or mosque at least once a month. Among LGBT Obama supporters, 43% say religion is important to them, and 31% go to church at least once a month.
Nearly half of LGBT Romney supporters (49%) are married or living with a partner, compared with 39% of Obama LGBT supporters.
LGBT Individuals Tend to Approve of Obama
Sixty-eight percent of LGBT Americans approved of the way Obama was doing his job as president during the June-September survey period, compared with 45% of non-LGBT Americans. Twenty-eight percent of LGBT Americans disapproved of the way Obama was doing his job, compared with 51% of non-LGBT individuals.
Implications
While LGBT voting preferences reveal a clear liberal tilt toward Democratic candidates, LGBT voters are not a totally monolithic political group, with 22% indicating support for Republican candidate Romney, 20% identifying as conservative, and 56% identifying as independent (43%) or Republican (13%). Notably, LGBT Americans who express more conservative and Republican political preferences share many of the traits common to other Americans with those political views. They tend to be older, white, and more religious.
Still, the fact that roughly seven in 10 LGBT voters can be expected to vote for Obama on Nov. 6 shows that these voters could be an important factor in helping him win re-election in a close race.

During the July 14 town hall simulcast on ESPN, President Obama doubled down on his gun control push by claiming that “it is easier to get a gun than it is access to a computer or a book.”
Obama said these things while interacting with a community organizer from Black Lives Matter (BLM).
The BLM community organizer asked Obama what safety for “poor black and brown communities” rests upon, beyond matters involving policing.
Obama responded by saying that “we expect police to solve a whole range of societal problems that we ourselves have neglected.” He then listed “communities without jobs,” “mental health [care],” and “jobs and training.” He pointed to the “drug trade” and “substandard schools” in others. Then he talked about the South Side of Chicago, where “14 and 15-year-old kids have firearms.”
He added, “It's easier to get a gun that it is access to a computer or a book.”
To make this statement Obama had to ignore the stringent gun controls in Chicago, controls that include an “assault weapons” ban, a violence tax, state-imposed waiting periods on handgun and long gun purchases, and strict limitations on the number of gun stores allowed in the city, as well as regulations on where those stores can be located.
Obama made an almost identical gun control push during the Dallas Police Memorial on Tuesday. Speaking there, he said, “It is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock that [to] get his hands on a computer or even a book.”

14ymedio, Luz Escobar, Havana, 13 September 2017 — Hundreds of people demonstrated in Havana's Diez de Octubre neighborhood on Wednesday afternoon, protesting the lack of electricity and water after Hurricane Irma. The protest began spontaneously, according to witnesses who spoke with 14ymedio.
“We want light! we want water!” and “The people, united, will never be defeated!” were the slogans shouted by the crowd, demanding basic services suspended since Saturday when the hurricane struck the island with winds over 125 miles an hour.
Among the slogans the demonstrators shouted there was also heard the cry of “Let Raul come!” calling for the president to visit the affected areas. So far, the leader has limited himself to sending a message of support to the citizenry, but has not visited the areas damaged by Hurricane Irma.
“From noon, the police closed (the main thoroughfare) Calzada de Diez de Octubre, because things got hot there,” one of the private taxi drivers serving the area told 14ymedio.
Dozens of officers of the Revolutionary National Police (PNR) and special troops known as Black Berets arrived at the scene after a few minutes of protest, but the protesters were not intimidated and continued their demands.
A neighbor of Santos Suárez park said that the demonstrators were around her house for “some hours” and from there they went towards the main thoroughfare, Calzada de Diez de Octubre, continuing to protest as they came up against a police barrier that prevented their passage.
“People got tired of the government's bad management and came out to protest. There was no alternative,” she added.
However, one protester said there were no arrests for the protests and that the uniformed officers withdrew with the promise to restore basic services “as soon as possible.”
“There was fear, nobody knew who was who because many policemen in civilian clothes arrived,” says another of the demonstrators.
As of 5:30 PM when 14ymedio was able to check the situation just hours after the demonstrations began, authorities had sent work teams from the electricity company and reestablished electricty and the water supply.
“Fidel had his flaws but he put on his foot down when these things happened and went out to the streets to solve the problems,” said an old woman.
After the protest, police patrols remained in the area and, according to the neighbors, many of the people found at key points in the area “look like they are state security.”
By about six o'clock in the afternoon a tense calm was felt. Some people took the opportunity to wash down the entryways in the area, and only spoke in low voices about what had happened just a few hours earlier.
Public protests are severely punished in Cuba. Last July 26, three activists from the Patriotic Union of Cuba challenged the authorities with banners denouncing “58 years of deceit, hunger and misery” in front of the Cathedral of Santiago de Cuba. After being arrested following a “savage beating,” the activists, who demanded freedom of expression, assembly and the press are being held in prison awaiting trial.
Daniel Llorente, another protester who on May Day ran with a US flag in front of the government parade is still confined to the capital's Psychiatric Hospital.
The biggest protest in the island's history during the rule of the brothers Fidel and Raúl Castro – known as the Maleconazo – occurred in August 1994 when hundreds of people confronted the police in Havana with sticks and stones, looting shops and calling for an end to socialism.
A Saskatoon landlord and his daughter say they're frustrated dealing with "squatters" who they say have taken residence in the backyard of a house embroiled in an eviction case.
"It looked like the city landfill site. It was deplorable," said 72-year-old Ervin Senger, the owner of the home on Avenue R South.
Senger has since hired someone to remove the debris for $700.
Some larger pieces of debris, including mangled bicycles and shopping carts, were removed Saturday. But lots of accumulated garbage, including clothing, remain in the backyard.

"Tents were created. It was full of garbage they brought in to the point that the fire department also contacted my father and let him know he had to remove the garbage," said daughter Debora Senger.
She said said they also found needles all over the yard.
"It's a safety [concern] for neighbouring children who may walk onto the property," she said.
Needles were also found at the site, according to the landlords. (Debora Senger)
Saskatoon fire department's acting battalion Chief Dale Altrogge said piled-up refuse in a yard can be ordered removed following a complaint from a neighbour on the grounds of unsightliness and because vermin might be attracted to the site.
This can also happen after a visual inspection from the fire department.
Dealing with squatters' property
Debora Senger said the tenant, who did not respond to multiple requests for comment, was given an eviction notice on Sept. 16.
She said the tenant has since returned to the home, where utilities have been cut off for weeks.
Other people have continued to stay in the backyard, according to Senger, and for a while inside a shed that's now been demolished.

"The situation has turned into one where half a dozen to, we don't know, up to 10, 12 people [are] squatting on the property," she said.
'Just need to follow the process'
Chanda Lockhart, the executive officer for the Saskatchewan Landlord Association, cautions landlords who are going through an eviction process against removing property from a backyard.
Lockhart said it's in the landlord's best interest not to remove anything until he has successfully obtained a writ of possession to have the tenant removed.
The exception is items that clearly don't belong there (such as shopping carts) or if the renter has signed a statement confirming the contents don't belong to them.

Even if that happens, Lockhart says Senger should wait until he has a writ of disposition authorizing him to toss the stuff in the backyard.
"It's very frustrating," she said of situations like Senger's. Senger said she's been in a similar situation with squatters through an eviction process.
"You just need to take a step back and breathe because rushing into the situation isn't going to help any. You just need to follow the process and it's only going to take another two to three weeks."
Debora Senger said her father is still weighing whether to apply for the writ of possession or to have health inspectors look inside the house to help him decide whether it should be condemned.
A common mistake about beer is that there are basically two types: the super-drinkable variety and the super-hoppy and bitter variety. For the first type you have your Bud Light and Corona, and for the second you have any IPA.
There's so much more to try though, spanning a wide range of taste, flavors, and malt.
The Beer Judge Certification Program lists 100 styles with defined ranges of alcohol by volume (ABV), bitterness (measured in IBUs, or International Bittering Units), and color (measured using SRM, or Standard Reference Method).
Below is a series of charts for all 100 styles. Mouseover any style for more details and commercial examples. Rectangles to the top right corner represent beer that is high in alcohol and high in bitterness. In contrast, a rectangle in the bottom left corner represents a beer that is low in alcohol and low in bitterness.
You'll notice that the lighter beers tend to have a tighter range of ABV and IBUs, whereas the bigger beers tend to vary more.
Individually, defensemen Jack Dougherty, Jack Glover, Jonathan MacLeod and Ryan Collins did well for the United States National Team Development Program Under-18 team this season.
Together, they elevated each other and capped their season with a gold medal at the 2014 IIHF World Under-18 Championship.
That togetherness carried them through a stressful time that saw them under the microscope of NHL scouts.
"It's always fun to have teammates around," MacLeod said. "Gives you a little bit of reassurance that you got some buddies here to support you and you support them."
Each of the four brought something different to the table.
Dougherty made the biggest impression in the quickest way, going from St. Thomas Academy in his native Minnesota to a huge part of the USNTDP blue line. In 55 games the 6-foot, 184-pounder had six goals and 22 points. At the World Under-18s he had two goals and four points in seven games, and his plus-7 rating was tied for first among all defensemen at the tournament.
NHL Central Scouting put him at No. 30 in its final ranking of North American skaters for the 2014 NHL Draft.
"Jack is a strong skater who moves well in any direction," Central Scouting's David Gregory said. "When he's being quick with his feet he is much more effective defending and with his gap control. He makes good decisions with the puck and is a very good passer off the rush. … He will probably need to be a little more physical at the next level, but that will certainly come as he gets stronger with age."
Most players who go through the USNTDP do it for two seasons, allowing the group to bond on and off the ice. Dougherty, though, didn't need long to become a key piece in the lineup.
"His learning curve was pretty steep," USNTDP U-18 coach Danton Cole said. "He brings a good element of offense to him. We relied on him defensively as well. He's a real well-rounded player. … We expected that he'd contribute. He was on our top power play and he also got a lot of defensive responsibility. He did a good job. That's what we expected of him."
Dougherty felt an immediate kinship with the rest of the group on and off the ice.
"All the guys were great," he said. "I felt like I was a part of the team right from Day 1 and that made it a lot easier."
It helped that he allowed his natural persona to show.
"Dougherty is a goofy kid," MacLeod said. "He's funny. He's always in a good mood."
MacLeod would know; he and Dougherty developed a bit of a comedic routine after wins.
"Me and Johnny used to re-enact a SpongeBob scene," Dougherty said, "the one where they're going and selling chocolates. We just go back and forth with our voices trying to sound like them. It's pretty funny."
When Dougherty wasn't making jokes, teammates were watching him for inspiration for their own game.
"Dougherty, the way he thinks the game, his offensive instincts, that's the thing that stuck out from him for me," Glover said. "It's something that I've enjoyed watching this year. I've tried to learn what I can from him, incorporate some of the stuff he does well into my game."
Glover has done just fine with his skill set. The 6-3, 190-pounder had 28 points in 59 games this season, and four points and a plus-2 rating in seven games at the World U-18s. He's No. 38 on Central Scouting's list.
"Jack has a pro style, especially when he's being physical," Gregory said. "He does a good job at letting the play develop and moving the puck to the correct man. He competes hard and he's tough to play against on almost every shift. Has lots of pro potential, especially as he gains experience at higher levels."
Cole said the biggest development in Glover's game was learning when to go for the big play offensively and when to hold back.
"One thing that he's improved an awful lot at is just figuring out that that play is not always there," Cole said. "Really good defensemen, a guy like Nick Lidstrom, they hit a lot of singles and once in a while there's a home run. I think the young guys that have that offensive gift sometimes think everything should be a home run. There's a subtlety to the game sometimes."
Another subtlety to Glover's game is his deviously quiet locker room mannerism.
"Jack Glover, he's always pretty sarcastic, especially around the guys," MacLeod said. "He always says those little things … I sit next to him in the locker room and you'll hear him say something under his breath and it'll be hilarious. Everyone's looking at me and saying, 'Why is MacLeod laughing?' No one hears Glover say the joke."
There's little to joke about with MacLeod's game. The 6-2, 200-pounder is the most physical of the foursome. He had five goals and 11 points in 51 regular-season games, and two goals, three points and a plus-4 rating at the Under-18s. He earned the No. 44 spot on Central Scouting's rankings.
"John plays a very physical style of game," Gregory said. "He is a very powerful hitter. When he does this he can dominate, especially in the defensive zone. It gives him lots of space to make a solid play with the puck."
The key for MacLeod is toeing the line between smart, physical play and being reckless. He had 70 penalty minutes in the regular season, but none in seven games at the U-18s.
"He likes playing [physical]," Cole said. "He's learned a lot about it; when to incorporate it and not taking penalties, having more of a controlled aggression. He's come a long way. For as physical as he played at the [Under-18s] he didn't take one penalty. But he certainly had the other teams aware of him on the ice. That's how you want to play and that's how you win championships with guys like that."
MacLeod understands how important it is for him to find that line and stay on the right side of it.
"It's about experience," he said. "I think when I first started doing it I was running around like a chicken with my head cut off. I was trying to take anybody who had the puck and kill them. As you get older and learn more about the game and how it can affect your [defense] partner, leaving him with a 2-on-1 if you step up on a guy. It's all about experience. You have to learn if you're going to do that, you have to make sure there's not going to be an odd-man rush behind you, so it's just experience."
Also still learning on the job is Collins, a 6-5, 202-pounder ranked No. 57 by Central Scouting.
"Ryan obviously has very good size," Gregory said. "He learned to use it to his advantage more as the season progressed. He's especially effective with his reach and mobility to be a good defender. He makes a deliberate first pass out of the defensive zone. He showed a good ability to carry the puck at times as well."
Collins had seven points in 59 games, saving his impact for the defensive end.
"He's a guy that we put in a lot of tough situations, most of the time against the other team's top lines or first guy out on the penalty kill," Cole said. "He started to really learn how to use his size and trust in his feet, because for a big man he's a real good skater. When he got comfortable in closing his gaps and playing tight coverage, he's real hard to get around and a bear to play against."
Collins said he looked at the trust the coaching staff had in him as a statement toward where he is in his development.
"Everyone has their role," he said. "When you find your role like that and you can do it well, it's always a compliment. It's something I embrace."
Next for Collins is the University of Minnesota, where he'll be joined by Glover. Dougherty is committed to the University of Wisconsin and MacLeod next will play at Boston University.
Though the foursome will separate for a while, it's likely they'll all see each other again in the NHL at some point.
"I think these guys are going to be good, consummate pros," Cole said. "They're going to find their way. … I think there's a lot more from all of them."

One night in July 2001, world chess champion Viswanathan Anand woke up with a start at his hotel room in Dortmund, Germany. He had been unable to sleep off the pain of going through the worst losing streak of his career. He was hovering at the bottom in the tournament in progress there but more importantly, his worst fears were just coming true.
He was staring at a long phase of poor form.
Unable to bear his suffering, Anand's wife Aruna suggested that he hit the gym as a way to take his mind off chess. So at 4 a.m. before a big game day, Anand ran on the treadmill. It didn't help. Forty five minutes later, he was back in the room still feeling dejected. She suggested they take a walk in the darkness, perhaps a fitting metaphor for their state of mind. Then they tried watching movies. Nothing worked. The child prodigy, India's first grandmaster who had stormed into the dog-eat-dog world of international chess 16 years earlier and had every great legend of the game run for cover, had hit rock-bottom. Of course, he finished last in the tournament with four losses, six draws and no wins. “Till date, if anybody mentions Dortmund, it hurts us a lot because Anand was struggling as if he was making an extraordinary effort just not to lose,” recalls Aruna.

Almost a decade later, in April 2010, a group of chess strategists in Bulgaria was trying to make Anand feel like a loser again. By now, he had gone on to become the world champion in every format of the game and was playing at top form even at the age of 40. And that was bad news for the handlers of Veselin Topalov, who was challenging Anand for the world crown.They opened a barrage of taunts to get him to become nervous before his title match against Topalov in the hope that he might make mistakes and lose. They commented about his age, technique, temperament and the moral support he had received from former rivals such as Garry Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik. The 12-game match was to be played in Topalov's home territory, Sofia, and the Icelandic ash cloud had forced Anand to take a 40-hour road journey across Europe to reach the match venue. The authorities rejected his request for a longer postponement and gave him just one extra day. Forced to play in tiring circumstances, Anand did falter in the first game and lose it. Team Topalov believed their tactics had worked and that a panicky Anand would soon yield the championship to their hero.True champions, as boxing legend Muhammad Ali once said, are those whose will is stronger than their skill. Sledging is a dangerous ploy to play against them because it only steels them further. Surviving in the snake pit is a key trick they have picked up on the way.As it turned out, the Bulgarians had underestimated Anand. He came back into the match and took an early lead. He had saved all his aggression for the board while his rivals had dissipated theirs in thinking up new taunts. In the end, it was Topalov who failed to hold nerves and lost to Anand. The world champion shrugged off the win, took his team for a celebratory dinner and just moved on.Viswanathan Anand started out as a shy child prodigy who liked to play hard and fast. But over time, he matured into a methodical player who could hold his nerves against any opponent. As he ages, his game has only sharpened. In the last three years, he has been virtually unbeatable. And despite all this, Anand remains fundamentally a simple guy, opening the door to visitors and helping his wife in laundry.But then, just how did this nice guy finish first?In 1988, Soviet grandmaster Efim Geller went to the southern Indian city of Coimbatore to play in a tournament. Geller was a legend and in the twilight of his career of four decades during which he had beaten other greats such as Bobby Fischer. But in Coimbatore, he lost to a little-known 18-year-old boy. When he went back to Moscow Chess Club, his peers teased him asking, “So we hear that you lost to a boy in India?” Geller replied, “Boy? I think I lost to a world champion.”That boy was Viswanathan Anand.Anand never left anyone in doubt about where he was headed in the game of chess. Manuel Aaron, India's first international master and a nine-time national champion, recalls that even when he saw him for the first time in the 1970s, Anand exuded a kind of energy and focus that could be described only as world-class. At the Mikhail Tal Chess Club in Chennai where Aaron guided young players, Anand was a unique talent. At Aaron's lectures on the great games of Soviet chess masters, it was only Anand who asked questions and even suggested alternative moves.Anand, himself, recalls Tal Club as the crucible in which he was cast. “I would go there even on Sundays. I would finish all my homework early so that I could be there by 11 in the morning. And I would play till 7 in the evening when the club closed. I don't know how many Sundays I had done that,” he says.

Gov. Phil Bryant signed the controversial Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act into law Tuesday morning, saying he did so to protect the rights of people with "deeply held religious beliefs."
HB 1523, authored by House Speaker Philip Gunn, has drawn state and national attention with groups as varied as the Human Rights Campaign and the Mississippi Manufacturers Association all calling for the governor to veto the bill.
Minutes after signing the bill, Bryant appeared on the JT Show on SuperTalkMS, a conservative talk radio show, to discuss the bill. He defended the bill, saying it only prevented "government from interfering with people of faith who are exercising their religious beliefs ... in matters of marriage." Bryant said it would not allow discrimination of anyone.
"This bill does not create one action against any class or group of people. It doesn't create a new action or a new defense of an action against those people," Byrant said.
Bryant's spokesperson Clay Chandler denied The Clarion-Ledger's request for an interview Tuesday.
UPDATE: Jackson City Council says 'We do not discriminate'
Bryant also denied claims by opponents that the bill would allow restaurants or governments to deny normal services to gay or lesbian people unless it was in the performing of a wedding ceremony. He cited a restaurant as an example, saying that a restaurant would not be allowed to deny serving a gay patron but could deny allowing a wedding to take place in the restaurant.
However, the bill says people can deny services or goods for the "celebration or recognition of any marriage, based upon or in a manner consistent with a sincerely held religious belief or moral conviction," which would include pre-ceremony celebrations, post-wedding celebrations, anniversary celebrations and other related celebrations, opponents argue.
The president of the Human Rights Campaign, which held a protest and rally Monday outside the state Capitol and the Governor's Mansion, said Bryant refused to meet with LGBT people and ignored business leaders.
"And now his state will suffer because of his ignorance and failure of leadership. Just as we're doing elsewhere, we will continue to rally fair-minded voters, businesses, and civil rights advocates to repeal," HRC President Chad Griffin said in a statement.
Bryant said he believes many arguments against the bill were filled with misinformation.
"What I've seen in my business, when people in the secular community want to attack a bill, and they give the worst possible examples of what will happen," he said.
Gunn praised Bryant for having the "courage and foresight" to sign the bill, and said he believes of the business leaders and others who came out against it, "I don't think they understood it."
Gunn said, "I certainly would hope not," when asked if he fears it will hurt Mississippi in economic development and competition for businesses. Despite opponents' warnings the bill is unconstitutional and open for federal lawsuits, Gunn said he's confident it could withstand court challenges.
Attorney General Jim Hood said any lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of House Bill 1523 will be handled on a case-by-case basis.
"We would caution government officials and others that House Bill 1523 does not override federal law or constitutional rights," Hood said in an emailed statement. "If a person or government official violates a federal statute or constitutional provision, House Bill 1523 will not protect that official from a federal lawsuit or from potential personal liability under federal law."
Ten other states have passed or are considering similar bills. North Carolina's governor and Legislature recently approved a similar law. On Tuesday, PayPal canceled plans for an expansion that would have created 450 jobs there, and a television studio pulled upcoming production from the state. Both actions were in response to the bill.
In Georgia, Republican Gov. Nathan Deal vetoed the bill passed by the Legislature after protests from businesses.
The Family Research Council, a Christian-based lobbying group, applauded the Governor's decision to sign the bill.
"We applaud Governor Bryant, Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, and House Speaker Philip Gunn, for standing up for the fundamental freedoms of the people they represent. No person should be punished by the government with crippling fines, or face disqualification for simply believing what President Obama believed just a few years ago, that marriage is the union of a man and a woman," Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said.
PRAISE AND PUSHBACK: Businesses, civil rights and religious organizations weigh in on HB 1523
A spokeswoman for Nissan said the company's statement from last week in opposition to HB 1523 "still stands."
"It is Nissan's policy to prohibit discrimination of any type, and we oppose any legislation that would allow discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals," the statement read.
The Mississippi Manufacturers Association issued the following statement:
"Regarding the passage of House Bill 1523, the Mississippi Manufacturers Association's position continues to reflect the concerns manufacturers have with this bill and its potential to conflict with their policies of diversity and inclusion. However, the MMA respects the wishes of the legislature and Governor."
The American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi released a statement opposing the governor's action.
“This is a sad day for the state of Mississippi and for the thousands of Mississippians who can now be turned away from businesses, refused marriage licenses, or denied housing, essential services and needed care based on who they are. This bill flies in the face of the basic American principles of fairness, justice and equality and will not protect anyone's religious liberty," said Jennifer Riley-Collins, Executive Director of the ACLU of Mississippi. "Far from protecting anyone from ‘government discrimination' as the bill claims, it is an attack on the citizens of our state, and it will serve as the Magnolia State's badge of shame.”
Jody Owens, managing attorney of the Southern Poverty Law Center, called the decision "unconscionable."
"This newly enacted law – like the draconian anti-LGBT laws in other states – uses the guise of ‘religious freedom' to justify discrimination, mistreatment and bigotry. It's the same sort of rationale used by white supremacists in earlier eras to justify slavery and Jim Crow," Owens said.
Mississippi Democratic Party spokeswoman Ouida Meruvia called the move "incredibly disappointing."
"Instead of tearing down walls that divide, the Republican Party has spent this session building new barriers of bigotry," she said. "We must do better."

What ever happened to the 15-hour work week predicted 87 years ago?
Posted
In 1930, the economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that technological change and productivity improvements would eventually lead to a 15-hour work week.
But, despite significant productivity gains over the past few decades, we still work 40 hours a week on average.
Keynes's reasoning was that by producing more with less (also known as being more productive), all of our needs would be met through less work, freeing up more time for leisure.
But the data and research since Keynes's time suggest that companies have kept the benefits of productivity for themselves.
In his own time, Keynes witnessed the rise of automated factories, mass production and the greater use of electricity, steam and coal.
He writes of a 40 per cent increase in factory output in the United States from 1919 to 1925. This productivity increase allowed for a higher standard of living and radically transformed the working world.
It was not a stretch for Keynes to predict future technologies would do the same thing once more.
A productivity explosion
According to one study, productivity in "office-based sectors" has increased by 84 per cent since 1970, almost solely due to computing power.
In other words, an office worker today can do in one hour what an office worker in 1970 took five hours to do. A full work day in 1970 can now be completed in 1.5 hours.
We are now twice as productive as Keynes imagined. The digital revolution has drastically increased the amount of work each individual worker can do.
Industries that benefited the most from new technology, including agriculture, had a 46 per cent increase in productivity from 1993 to 2004 alone, at the height of the tech boom.
Innovation in farming technology was the root cause of this "productivity boom".
In the legal industry, the idea of a "paperless" office dramatically increased productivity at the largest law firms from the late 1990s, when the internet came into play.
Now, large law firms are investing in new technologies like cloud computing, document management systems and even rudimentary artificial intelligence.
The latter could be particularly transformative, allowing firms to quickly analyse large documents and data sets.
Thanks to all of this technology, one report found that for "80 per cent of matters" a recent law graduate is more productive than someone with ten years' experience at a law firm.
In other words, technology is increasing productivity so fast that it is outpacing the productivity benefits of having actual work experience.
Stagnant work hours
Yet these significant productivity gains are not translating into fewer working hours. The reason for this is partly political and partly economic.
Instead of reducing working hours, productivity gains have been met by calls for greater productivity gains.
Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten, for instance, are in agreement that "higher productivity … leads to more jobs and higher wages". Keynes, on the other hand, was arguing for an economy with fewer jobs, less working hours and, paradoxically, higher wages.
At an economic level, productivity gains have been absorbed into most companies' bottom line.
While employee wage growth has stayed flat, CEO pay has risen dramatically over the years, stalling only recently.
A report from the Economic Policy Institute found that CEO pay has increased by 937 per cent since 1978, compared to a mere 10.2 per cent increase in average wages. In other words, the benefits of productivity have gone straight to the top.
In many industries companies have used productivity improvements to get larger, increasing the amount of business they do.
By the end of the tech boom of the 1990s, for instance, Australia had six of the world's 40 largest law firms.
In accounting, the Big Four accounting firms have had record-breaking increases in revenue in the 2010s, while their employees are reportedly "worked to death".
Instead of discussing the benefits of increasing productivity even further, our politicians and business leaders need to start discussing the missed opportunities of our productivity boom.
Like the missed opportunity of taxing the mining boom, Australia is missing out on a massive reduction in working hours due to us from the productivity boom of the 1990s and early 2000s.
As the spectre of AI and robotics looms ahead of us, and people again start talking about future techno utopias, we must deal with the economic realities of the past.
Technology, far from freeing up our lives, has been used to keep us working the same amount of time, benefiting only the top of our society.
Properly conceived, new technology should give us greater leisure time than ever before. But, to do so, increases in productivity need to be directly tied to wage growth and working hours.
Increases in productivity should be met either with increased wages, or a reduction in working hours at the same wage level. Failing this, the few will continue to benefit from the harder and harder work of the many.

Liberal heavyweight Eric Abetz retains top spot on Tasmanian Senate ticket
Updated
Tasmania's most senior Liberal, Eric Abetz, has retained the top spot on the state Senate ticket.
Key points Liberal Senator Eric Abetz voted first spot on Tasmanian Senate ticket
Stephen Parry endorsed for second spot on the ticket
Jonathan Duniam was the third endorsed candidate
Liberal party confident of strong team of candidates in 2016 election
Sixty-six designated Liberal pre-selectors met in Launceston to grill the four candidates for the Senate ticket, before votes were cast this afternoon to finalise the order.
Senate President Stephen Parry has been endorsed for the second spot on the ticket.
The Tasmanian Premier's deputy chief of staff, Jonathan Duniam was the third endorsed candidate.
Senator Abetz was demoted from his senior Cabinet position to the backbench when Malcolm Turnbull took over as Prime Minister, but has remained a powerful figure within the Tasmanian party.
There was speculation at the time by some Liberal members that Senator Abetz would also lose some of his power within the Tasmanian party and might retire.
Mr Abetz said he was honoured to be re-endorsed.
The party heavyweight said he would continue to campaign hard to secure three Senate positions for the Liberals at the next election.
"If we could get another senator to Canberra then our voice in the party room would be so much stronger, and given the uplift in the polls in recent times, both for Premier [Will] Hodgman locally and Prime Minister [Malcolm] Turnbull nationally, we believe we are capable of winning that third seat."
"It will be a hard fight, but we will be in it to win it."
Attracting the 'young' vote for Liberal with candidate
Mr Abetz said the addition of Mr Duniam to the ticket may help sway votes.
"For the Liberal party it has always been a challenge to harness the vote of the under 35s, and in Jonathon Duniam we have such a candidate," he said.
"It is a balanced ticket given that we've only got the option of three candidates."
Mr Abetz also said he "definitely" had another six years to offer and intended to see out another full term.
Traditionally, the Liberals and Labor poll high enough in Tasmania to secure at least two Senate seats each, the Greens win one seat, leaving only one seat uncertain.
As a result, there was a prior push to replace Mr Parry with a fresh face in the second position on the Liberals' ticket.
Tasmanian Liberal party head Geoff Page said the party would head into the 2016 election with a strong team.
"It's a very democratic process, there was debate amongst those delegates but look the outcomes been very satisfactory."
"We think that our electoral stocks in Tasmania are doing very well."

A CBC investigation into Canada's two largest coffee companies has led to more revelations about poor environmental practices at Starbucks and Tim Hortons.
The stories come on the heels of a CBC Marketplace investigation, revealing how paper cups that customers tossed into store recycling bins at Toronto Starbucks and Tim Hortons were actually being thrown into the garbage, not recycled at all.
After the story aired, Starbucks issued a notice to be posted in stores for customers to read.
It said, "Upon hearing of some stores that had not disposed of recyclable material properly, we immediately conducted a review of all our stores across the country, and are taking steps to ensure and confirm that all our stores are delivering on our recycling commitment."
A notice posted in Starbucks outlets says the company regrets 'disappointing any customers or partners.' (CBC) The notice also says the company regrets "disappointing any customers or partners."
But now, current and former employees at both Starbucks and Tim Hortons tell CBC that they, too, have witnessed environmentally unfriendly practices for years.
A current Vancouver-area Starbucks manager describes overflowing recycling dumpsters behind numerous Starbucks stores he manages today — so full, he says, paper cups and other recyclables have to be thrown in the garbage.
But he says when he and other store managers asked a district manager and an area facilities service manager a year ago what private company was supposed to be picking up the recycling, they were told to "move on to something more important."
The manager says he is "frustrated" that Starbucks "pretends to be much more environmentally friendly than it is."
3 holes, one garbage bag
Several Toronto Starbucks employees describe how some in-store recycling bins had three holes for separating recyclables, but only one bag, so everything got mixed up together and was then thrown in the garbage dumpster.
"I was instructed that they do get thrown out, because we actually do not recycle at that facility," said someone who stopped working at that Starbucks in May.
An employee who worked at three Toronto area Starbucks for two years but left in October 2014 for full-time work elsewhere wrote to CBC about the plastic containers used for flavoured drinks.
"Every syrup container and frap base container is thrown IN THE GARBAGE every day… We threw out garbage bag after garbage bag every night."
The employee added, "Not to mention the compost that could be made of the coffee grounds that were constantly thrown out."
Workers at Tim Hortons shared other environmental concerns.
An employee currently working at Tim Hortons in Brechin, Ont., says people who think they are avoiding paper waste by bringing portable coffee mugs are being "duped."
Starbucks and Tim Hortons coffee cups ended up in the garbage despite the companies' recycling claims. (Associated Press) In an email, she writes, "We are encouraged to make their coffee in a paper cup and pour it in the travel mug... to make sure we are not giving more coffee than purchased."
She says, "The paper cup then goes into the garbage with no environmental savings."
Several other Tim Hortons employees have shared the same concerns. And on Nov. 5 CBC witnessed this at a Tim Hortons right below the CBC's Canadian Broadcasting Centre in Toronto.
Also in Toronto, many of the Tim Hortons stores visited by CBC were using black garbage bags in their recycling containers instead of clear ones designated for recycling in Toronto and many other municipalities.
A former Tim Hortons worker emailed to say black garbage bags were also used for recycling at the stores she worked in three years ago in Saint John, N.B., and Fredericton. "When the garbage is changed, everything is put in black garbage bags & thrown in the ONLY garbage dumpster they have," she writes.
In-store recycling bins
Starbucks and Tim Hortons have championed various environmental programs, saying in annual reports that environmental leadership is important. A key program by both companies was introducing in-store recycling bins more than five years ago.
Today, Starbucks says those blue recycling bins are in about half their stores across Canada. Tim Hortons says the recycling bins are in almost a quarter of their stores. As of June 2013 there were 3,400 Tim Hortons stores in Canada. As of 2014 Starbucks had 1,400 Canadian outlets.
Neither coffee giant agreed to be interviewed for the Marketplace investigation, which stirred up a storm of controversy on social media.

The investigation featured two Marketplace employees outfitting paper coffee cups with tracking sensors, and then dropping them in recycling bins inside Toronto Starbucks and Tim Hortons stores. Later, the employees returned and found half of their 28 cups were in the garbage, not recycling. The other 14 cups could not be located.
A Tim Hortons sign stands near Walker Road and Wyandotte Street East in Windsor, Ont. (Geoff Nixon/CBC) Adria Vasil, the bestselling author of the Ecoholic book series and green columnist for Toronto's NOW magazine, says she was "outraged" by the results of the investigation.
"Clearly, these companies know the benefit of good green PR. They don't want customers to feel guilty about throwing out all those cups, and they've leveraged goodwill out of those green campaigns. And then to turn around and do nothing about implementing them properly, and making sure that it's not just a bunch of hot air is maddening."
Vasil worries that a demonstrated lack of corporate action can wear out the public's goodwill when it comes to supporting environmental programs.
"It makes you wonder about all their ... green sustainability programming. How much is authentic, and how much is just lip service? I think we could expect this even a decade ago, but today I am shocked to see such big chains acting with so little regard to the environment."
Customers complain
Several people who viewed the Marketplace investigation wrote to Starbucks to express their disappointment and shared their correspondence with CBC.
In Ottawa, realtor Tim Dillon told the company, "Not recycling yet you say you do is just deceptive. I now wunder (sic) are your other...programs real????? I will take my money elsewhere. I spend about $60 per week at your stores."
CBC shared the workers' concerns with Starbucks and Tim Hortons, and requested interviews with both companies. Both companies declined.
In an email that did not address the workers' concerns raised, Starbucks said the company is "committed to recycling and reducing the impact of waste generated in our stores."
Tim Hortons did not address the issues raised by workers, either, but in an email said the company was proud of its recycling and waste initiatives and they "know there is more work to do."
This story is based on an investigation by Tiffany Foxcroft.
The art of arranging marine algae into designs, bouquets, and even sometimes intricate little scenes, was surprisingly popular in the nineteenth century. The particularly fine examples featured here, using doilies as frames, are from an album presented to Augustus Graham, a member of the first board of directors of the Brooklyn Apprentice's Library, later to become the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences and the Brooklyn Museum. Graham also served as the first president of the Institute of Arts and Sciences between 1840-1851 and the album was given to him as a thank you in recognition of his work. Made by a woman named Eliza A. Jordson, it contains – apart from the specimens of seaweed – an essay on the method of transferring the algae to paper, as well as a poem on the “flowers of the sea”.
Ah! call us not weeds —
We are flowers of the sea
For lovely and bright
And gay tinted are we —
We are quite independent
Of culture and showers
Then call us not weeds
We are oceans's gay flowers.
Variations on the poem crop uptime and again in other examples of seaweed pictures, and it is even mentioned in Jane Austen's unfinished 1817 novel Sandition when a seaweed picture is spied through the window of a shop. Its provenance is not entirely clear, though sources seem to imply it is possibly the work of E. L. Aveline.
Viperchill posted an in-depth, analytical article that shouldn't be as shocking to SEO veterans as it will be to newer professionals entering the field. Google has a tendency to be fair and just, and the search engine giant has shown that they're willing to take strict measures against websites – especially thin affiliate sites – in an effort to make their search results better.
But what happens when 16 closely-tied companies dominate the search results?
Even worse, what happens when one new, thin site is created and clearly violates Google's terms? Zilch. In fact, the company in question (more on that soon) is dominating the search results, and it's not only unfair, it's also a punch in the gut to website owners that don't have the major links that this one site got in such a short amount of time.
The violations we're talking about can be found here and here.
Clearly the site has thin content when their “top 10 best cold press juicers” along with hundreds of other pages has mere 50-word­ descriptions, and they link right to Amazon for a juicy commission on each sale.
The site in question is: Bestproducts.com.
Honestly, I picked a random article from the site, and I don't know how this particular article ranks in the SERPS. But Viperchill found that the site ranked for:
Best dishwasher 2016
Best makeup brushes
Best wireless earbuds
Haircuts
And these are just some of many rankings for the thin-content site.
What's the Big Deal?
Big deal. The site has probably been around for ages and has authority, right? Wrong. It's been around since October, and receives 600,000 people to its sites per month from Google. Anyone that has ever tried to rank a website knows that getting 600,000 hits just from Google in a month is equivalent to hitting the lottery.
Add in the factor that the site is just 8 months old, and thousands of SEO professionals are shedding tears.
Another issue is that Google doesn't really appreciate site-wide links, but when they come from some of the largest media companies in the world, Google's algorithm seems to look the other way.
The media giants linking to the site in their footer are:
Esquire
Elle
Marie Claire
Cosmopolitan
Popularmechanics
Webmasters that own a lot of sites would link to their own domains, too. The companies and website in question are owned by Hearst Media. Viperchill points to the timing of the links with:
2 links on November 5th
2 links on April 5th
It's interesting that these four giant media sites decided that November 5th and April 5th were good days to add the link back to Bestproducts.
Google's lack of action is the surprising culprit in these whole link scheme – mastermind project. Anyone with a network as powerful as Hearst's would do the same. But when you break it down (check Viperchill's post for a full breakdown of the 16 companies), it becomes apparent that we're all visiting sites owned by the same company.
If you type in dark souls 3 review, you'll find that CBS ranks for 4 of the top 10 spots, with the “big 16” having 7 of the top 8 positions. The same happens in health, beauty, automotive and cooking. Type in hair colour ideas, and Hearst has 5 of the top 7 rankings under different websites that the company owns.
Big media runs everything, and people know that to some extent. The tactics used would be used by any company with the same resources, but the lack of discipline on Google's behalf is concerning.
The site's pages consist of little more than:
Affiliate links
A few brief words
Images
Google's main site states “Google believes that pure, or ‘thin,' affiliate websites do not provide additional value for web users,” and millions of websites have been punished for having “thin” content in the past.
Bestproducts is being treated unfairly in terms of rankings.
Under normal circumstances, any site receiving links from the biggest names in media, especially in the footer and site-wide, would have a red flag thrown at them. At least there would be some suspicion on Google's behalf to look at what's occurring.
What's even more startling is that Bestproducts went from idea to fruition in just six weeks, according to Glen, the author of the post. Hearst Media believes they can churn out sites quickly and rank just as fast – an unfair advantage to the rest of the world.
SEMRush's data points to BestProducts getting the equivalent of $583,000 in free traffic from Google in a short amount of time.
Media companies are beginning to control Google's first pages for millions of keywords, forcing their brands and products on the very users Google always vows to protect, whie the little site gets penalized.
James Bond And Omega
A Brief History Of James Bond's Watches
On the October 26th in the UK, and on November 9th in the U.S., James Bond will return to theaters for the 23rd time in 50 years.
Over the years, Bond has become a style icon, what with his preference for fine suits by Brioni and Tom Ford, shoes by Church and Sunspel polo shirts. Bond also has exceptional taste in watches.
In the novels by Ian Fleming, James Bond wore a Rolex Explorer. But, as you probably know, he never wore one in the films. Instead, he wore a Submariner in the '60s and '70s, followed by a bunch of digital Seiko watches in the late '70s and early '80s, and then returned to Rolex again in the late 1980s.
But since 1995, Bond has been choosing to wear Omega. Or Omega is choosing James Bond — we don't know. We do know that James Bond, played by Pierce Brosnan at the time, was suddenly wearing this cool blue Seamaster Professional (ref. 2541.80) watch in GoldenEye. This first Omega watch was a quartz Seamaster 300M with a laser beam that came in handy for our favorite secret agent.
In the follow-up movies, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day, Bond wears the automatic chronometer version of the Seamaster Professional 300M watch, the ref. 2531.80. Although out of production, it is still a very popular watch in the pre-owned watch market. People still refer to it as "the James Bond watch."
When Daniel Craig became the new James Bond in the Casino Royale flick, Omega decided to take the opportunity to cross over from the Seamaster Professional 300M collection to its then-new Seamaster Planet Ocean collection. The Seamaster Professional 300M (ref. 2220.80) in Casino Royale is very similar to the one used by Craig's predecessor, Pierce Brosnan, but is now equipped with George Daniels' coaxial escapement invention. Omega has been making sure almost all of its mechanical watches (with the exception of the Moonwatch) are equipped with the coaxial movement, and so was the Seamaster Professional 300M "Bond" model.
In the same movie, Daniel Craig starts wearing the Omega Seamaster Planet Ocean (ref. 2900.50.91) watch, a large (45.5-mm) sports watch on a rubber strap. At some point in Casino Royale, something happens that even watch fans found too much. When Bond and Vesper Lynd are traveling by train, Lynd looks at Bond's wrists and asks "Rolex?" "Omega" replies Bond, and that was that.
In Daniel Craig's appearance as Bond in Quantum of Solace, he's wearing another Seamaster Planet Ocean. This time, it is the more downsized ref. 2201.50.00, a 42-mm version of the Seamaster Planet Ocean on a stainless steel bracelet. Quantum of Solace is the end of Bond wearing the Seamaster Professional 300M watch, something that some Omega Seamaster fans will certainly regret.
In Skyfall, Bond will at least wear another Seamaster Planet Ocean again. That's for sure. Omega commemorates the Bond movies often with a limited-edition version of the watch used in the movies. For Skyfall, Omega introduced a limited series of its Seamaster Planet Ocean 600M. Only 5007 pieces (it's the 50th year of 007) will be produced worldwide.
This Seamaster Planet Ocean "Skyfall'"600M will come with Omega's latest in-house developed coaxial movement, caliber 8507 with a special "Skyfall 007" engraving on its rotor. Since this watch is also equipped with the "Si14" silicon balance spring, Omega offers a four-year warranty on these watches. The Seamaster Planet Ocean "Skyfall" comes with a special presentation box.
To commemorate the 50th anniversary of Bond, Omega also introduced a special Seamaster Professional 300M earlier this year (during BaselWorld). A black version of the famous blue Seamaster Professional 300M that has a black lacquered dial with a 007 monogram and a super-cool gun-barrel design on the caseback.
HTTP/2 adoption is still low at 0.4%, but growing fast thanks to LiteSpeed
Summary: The new version 2 of the HTTP protocol has a somewhat unexpected pioneer. Most of the sites that support HTTP/2 right now are relying on LiteSpeed.
The new HTTP/2 standard, whose final version has been published in May 2015, is now used by 0.4% of all websites (up from 0.24% at the beginning of the month), and by 7.5% of the top 1,000 sites.
Compared, for example, with 4.8% adoption of SPDY, the unofficial protocol developed by Google which is the technical basis of HTTP/2, that is still quite low.
All local Google sites and some other Google properties such as YouTube support HTTP/2 (in addition to SPDY). However, if we look at the HTTP/2 adoption rate broken down by web servers, the result is a bit surprising. Only 0.6% of websites that run Google servers support HTTP/2, primarily because all the Blogger sites have not yet been switched over.
What is surprising is that 19.5% of LiteSpeed servers already offer HTTP/2. LiteSpeed is used by 2.2% of all websites, and currently 96.5% of all HTTP/2 sites are running LiteSpeed.
Other web servers will follow soon. Apache, the leading web server, has not yet made an official announcement, but an unofficial HTTP/2 module is already available.
Nginx, a pioneer in SPDY adoption, has announced HTTP/2 support by the end of the 2015.
Microsoft-IIS does not yet support HTTP/2 (therefore all HTTP/2 sites at the moment run Unix-link operating systems), but it will support HTTP/2 on Windows 10, which they will begin to roll out at the end of July.
Considering the relatively painless transition from HTTP/1 to HTTP/2 we can assume that HTTP/2 will become the dominant version. One observation should make us less optimistic for a speedy adoption: even when all major web server support the protocol, we still need webmasters to switch over to new versions of their servers, and that can take time. For example, more than 3 years after the release of Apache 2.4, only 20% of Apache servers use this "new" version. Adoption rates for new versions of Microsoft-IIS are not much faster, only Nginx users move more quickly.
That could mean that HTTP/1 will dominate web traffic for two or three more years. In the meantime, you can watch HTTP/2 adoption in our dedicated report, which is updated daily.

(Natural News) Researchers have found that cheese can now be considered a superfood – as long as it's Swiss cheese.
The bacterium Propionibacterium freudenreichii, which is used in the fermentation of Emmentaler – the proper name of Swiss cheese, because it came from the Emmental region of Switzerland – is found to be beneficial to health.
In a study that was conducted by scientists at Korea University in Seoul that was published in Scientific Reports, it was found out that the bacteria can provide longevity and improve the lifespan of, wait for it, roundworms.
However, the researchers were quick to note that, “It is possible that the mechanisms identified in this study may apply to other species including humans.”
The team said the bacterium turns lactate – the compound that burns muscles – into three substances: acetate, carbon dioxide, and propionate. Acetate and propionate are known to benefit humans' immune systems.
Also, other lactic bacteria are present in Swiss cheese. These are Weisella koreensis and Weissella cibaria, which extend the lifespan by protecting the body against stress and the invasion of pathogens and providing an anti-inflammatory effect on the immune system.
To make the deal even sweeter, an earlier report found that indulging on aged cheeses such as cheddar, brie, and Parmesan can also improve the longevity of one's life –increasing life expectancy by over 25 percent – while preventing liver cancer.
Another study that was done in March of this year showed that people who partake of cheeses are slimmer than those who do not, with people who partake of low-fat dairy having higher cholesterol levels than people who are just dairy fans. Ingesting cheese can apparently also protect you from heart ailments.
Mother Nature's micronutrient secret: Organic Broccoli Sprout Capsules now available, delivering 280mg of high-density nutrition, including the extraordinary "sulforaphane" and "glucosinolate" nutrients found only in cruciferous healing foods. Every lot laboratory tested. See availability here.
Swiss cheese and its holes
According to CultureCheeseMag.com, the flavor of the Swiss cheese can be determined by how big its holes are: the bigger the hole, the better the flavor.
Another reason why Swiss cheese has holes is the presence of Propionibacter shermani, which are added to the milk that is used to manufacture cheese at the time of cheese-making. The bacteria take away the cheese's lactic acid and release bubbles of carbon dioxide gas which then form into holes.
Cheesemakers can make the Swiss cheese's holes bigger or smaller as they prefer by changing the temperature to which theybring the milk, the milk's acidity, and the wheel's aging time.
American-produced Swiss cheeses tend to have smaller air pockets, making their flavor more mild and creamy. European-made Swiss cheeses, on the other hand, have a rich and nutty flavor. (Related: Are some cheese more nutritious than others?)
Hearing benefits
Scientists made another remarkable discovery; this time regarding all kinds of cheeses. They found out that cheeses contain the chemical compound D-methionine, which can prevent and even heal damage to nerves in the ear, with research saying that the chemical can reverse hearing loss if administered within seven hours of exposure to loud noise. No commercial drugs that are manufactured presently can replicate the same effect.
So the next time that you're craving for a cheese snack, you might want to take a bite out of that Swiss cheese, burrata, Stilton, Camembert, feta, halloumi, or mozzarella. With all of the pleasure and none of the guilt that comes from indulging on cheese, you might finally say to yourself, “Sweet dreams are made of cheese.”

When I was eighteen, I stumbled across Richard Wright's poem “Between the World and Me.” The poem, a retelling of a lynching, shook me, because while the narrator relays the details in the first person, the actual victim of that brutish ritual is another man, unknown to him and unknown to us. The poem is about the way in which history is an animate force, and how we are witnesses to the past, even to that portion of it that transpired before we were born. He writes,
darkness screamed with thirsty voices; and the witnesses rose and lived:
The dry bones stirred, rattled, lifted, melting themselves
into my bones.
The grey ashes formed flesh firm and black, entering into
my flesh.
Nothing save random fortune separated the fate of the man who died from that of the one telling the story. Errin Whack and Isabel Wilkerson have both written compellingly about the long shadow of lynching. It is, too often, a deliberately forgotten element of the American past—one that is nonetheless felt everywhere in Ferguson, Missouri, where protests followed the shooting of Michael Brown, who was eighteen years old, by a police officer. One can't make sense of how Brown's community perceived those events without first understanding the way that neglected history has survived among black people—a traumatic memory handed down, a Jim Crow inheritance.
It took sixteen days for Brown's body to be buried, an extended postscript that included three separate autopsies, the emergence of duelling interpretations of his last moments, and the resolution of precisely nothing about how race, media, and policing operate in the United States. A year ago, people gathered in anticipation of a verdict in the trial of George Zimmerman, the man who killed Trayvon Martin. During that case, images of people wearing hoodies, as Martin had when he was shot, proliferated on social media. This month, it has been portraits of people with their hands raised, in recognition of a number of witness accounts that Brown tried to surrender before being shot by police officer Darren Wilson. (Wilson, according to press reports, has told people that Brown was running at him.) The idea, in both instances, is that, like Wright's narrator, any of us could be Martin, Brown, or one of the hundreds of others who have died under questionable circumstances. There is a disturbing sense that this is how we spend our summers now, submerged in outrage, demonstrating, yet again, the hard parameters of public sympathy and the damnable, tiresome burden of racism.
In the days after 9/11, it was common to hear people say that it was the first time Americans had really experienced terrorism on their own soil. Those sentiments were historically wrong, and willfully put aside acts that were organized on a large scale, had a political goal, and were committed with the specific intention of being nightmarishly memorable. The death cult that was lynching furnished this country with such spectacles for a half century. (The tallies vary, but, by some estimates, there were thirty-three hundred lynchings in the decades between the end of Reconstruction and the civil-rights era.) We know intuitively, not abstractly, about terrorism's theatrical intent. The sight of Michael Brown, sprawled on Canfield Drive for four hours in the August sun, dead at the hands of an officer who was unnamed for a week, recalled that memory. It had the effect of reminding that crowd of spontaneous mourners of their own refuted humanity. A single death can be understood as a collective threat. The media didn't whip up these concerns among the black population; history did that.
For fifteen days this month, people marched in heat and thunderstorms, amid tear gas, despite the warnings of police styled as a militia, undeterred by the tear gas or the obstinacy of the local bureaucracy. They persisted despite the taint that opportunistic violence and looting imposed upon their efforts.
Linda Chavez wondered on Fox News whether “the ‘unarmed teen' mantra” really fit Brown, who was six feet four and nearly three hundred pounds and had been caught on video shoplifting—and, it perhaps bears repeating, was a teen, and was unarmed. Chavez was roundly criticized, but she was really only guilty of saying aloud what many others have thought. Whatever happened or did not happen between Michael Brown and Darren Wilson on a winding side street, in the middle of the afternoon, in a non-descript outpost on the edge of a midsized city, whatever we imagine we know of the teen-ager, the salient fact is that he did not live long enough to cultivate his own answers.
I spent eight days in Ferguson, and in that time I developed a kind of between-the-world-and-Ferguson view of the events surrounding Brown's death. I was once a linebacker-sized eighteen-year-old, too. What I knew then, what black people have been required to know, is that there are few things more dangerous than the perception that one is a danger. I'm embarrassed to recall that my adolescent love of words doubled as a strategy to assuage those fears; it was both a pitiable desire for acceptance and a practical necessity for survival. I know, to this day, the element of inadvertent intimidation that colors the most innocuous interactions, particularly with white people. There are protocols for this. I sometimes let slip that I'm a professor or that I'm scarcely even familiar with the rules of football, minor biographical facts that stand in for a broader, unspoken statement of reassurance: there is no danger here. And the result is civil small talk and feeble smiles and a sense of having compromised. Other times, in an elevator or crossing a darkened parking lot, when I am six feet away but the world remains between us, I remain silent and simply let whatever miasma of stereotype or fear might be there fill the void.
Fuck you, I think. If I don't get to feel safe here, why should you?
Determining sex is often a requirement of checks at airports and stations. But if staff are unsure, how they respond is key
When Londoner Jamie Liang reached the Eurostar security checkpoint at London St Pancras International he put his possessions on the conveyor belt and entered the body scanner. It beeped. Instead of searching him, he said officials summoned him to one side, demanded to see his passport and, when he repeatedly asked why, threatened to call the police. The reason was eventually explained loudly, he says, in front of other passengers: security staff were unclear whether he was male or female and wanted proof of his sex before deciding which official should search him.
“I identify as a gay male,” says Liang. “If you benchmark me against a cage fighter you might consider me to be a bit on the feminine side. ‘Gender-neutral' is probably the best way to describe me. The protocols of Eurostar St Pancras seem to have an issue with processing passengers like myself. I was treated like a criminal by security pulling me aside and shouting rudely and I was publicly humiliated by being asked private information in front of a large audience.”
Liang, who is not transgender, fears that his treatment exposes wider discrimination faced by LGBT travellers . “I was told by the supervisor that he was ‘following company protocol'. If that is the case, Eurostar is doing something really wrong,” he says. “They could have respectfully asked me to verify my sex/gender in private and they didn't need my passport to find out my preferred choice of male or female attendant for a full body pat down – I told them from the start I was happy to be searched by a male. If I were indeed transgender I would have been humiliatingly outed in public.”
New gay travel firm increases holiday choice for LGBT travellers Read more
Liang's claims highlight potential difficulties across the international transport network, as bureaucracy and individual security staff attempt to keep pace with gender rights.
“We receive many complaints from people who have experienced harassment and discrimination because their presenting gender doesn't correspond with their passport details,” says Zhan Chiam, gender identity and expression programme officer at ILGA, a federation of international organisations that campaign on LGBT rights. “Policing of gender needs to stop, and security staff sensitised to people's needs.”
Eurostar insists both to Liang and The Observer that its staff are not legally allowed to search passengers of opposite gender. However, when asked to cite the relevant legislation it amends its response and declares that its security processes operate within regulations and industry best practice. “We have a duty of care to protect our teams and the request for travel documents is part of this,” says a spokesperson. “It is carried out to identify gender in a discreet and sensitive way. On this occasion, Mr Liang did not comply with providing the travel documents requested by our teams to resolve the issue.”
Liang points out that his passport was inaccessible on the conveyor belt while he was being held behind a cordon. He was eventually patted down by a male officer and allowed to board his train to Brussels. “I was trembling and so distressed by this traumatic experience,” he says. “It kind of ruined my holiday.”
Security controls are supposed to check for weapons or illegal substances, but gender becomes an issue when body scans or pat downs reveal an unexpected attribute. Some scanners used in the UK, and all of those at US airports, have to be programmed according to sex and staff are alerted if the scan shows a prosthesis, chest bindings or what the industry refers to as a biological “anomaly”.
Policing of gender needs to stop, and security staff sensitised to people's needs Zhan Chiam, ILGA
A transgender writer, Shadi Petosky, live tweeted her ordeal when a scanner at a US airport revealed her genitalia was male. She was forced to be screened a second time after the scanner had been reprogrammed to “male” and missed her flight. Her story prompted dozens of tweets from other travellers who report having had their anatomy publicly questioned and examined.
Security firms are privately employed by airports and stations and follow their own protocols, although they have to comply with the Equalities Act which forbids discrimination against trans people. According to the Airport Operators Association, all UK airports allow transgender passengers to be searched in private by staff that correspond with the gender they identify with, and evidence of gender is only rarely required.
However, border control, where identities are verified, is where most problems arise for those whose appearance seems at odds with their passport face, according to the LGBT charity Stonewall.
The Home Office admits searches may cause “practical difficulties”, and guidance states that the dignity of the individual is paramount. It also recognises a potential conflict of rights and declares that officers must not be forced to search a person who, whilst living in the same gender as the officer, does not share their physical attributes.

The UK government, which last year announced that medical evidence is no longer a requirement when changing the gender on a passport, is reviewing the obligation to specify gender at all. This is, however, a requirement by the International Civil Aviation Organisation and any changes would need the agreement of other member countries.
Stonewall would like to see the gender options expanded. “Trans people can face unnecessary obstacles because of the way gender is recorded on official documents,” says spokesperson Kim Sanders. “Many are afraid to travel abroad for fear of intrusive questioning or difficulties at passport control. We would like to see legal recognition of non-binary people, including an X category on passports.”
Liang continues to press for an official apology from Eurostar in the hope it will change its procedures. “If they wanted to search me it should have been done in private,” he says. “Their reluctance to apologise shows how far we still have to travel. True equality comes not when LGBTQ couples are allowed to marry, but when basic humiliations stop happening in everyday life.”
ADVICE WHEN GOING OVERSEAS
In large parts of the world LGBT travellers face risks – 72 countries outlaw same-sex relationships and many refuse to allow people to change their gender marker on legal documents. Transgender travellers should therefore be aware of laws and attitudes in their destination country.
In some cases it might be wise to take a relevant doctor's letter or gender recognition certificate, in case officials question perceived disparities between appearance and travel documents. All flight reservations require gender to be specified along with your name, and these details must match those on the passport even if you identify as a different gender. If you have not yet had your passport amended, you will have to book and travel as the name and gender recorded on it.
When you pass through security, some items such as prosthetics and bindings may be flagged as an “anomaly”. Official advice is to explain calmly and clearly what the item is. You should never be asked to remove or raise clothing to display it. Gel-filled prosthetics are classed as medical items and are not included in the 100g liquid limit, but they may be examined during the screening of hand luggage.
If stopped, most Western airports allow passengers to specify which gender they prefer to be searched by, and to request that it be performed in private with a witness.

On July 18, 1610, a man named Michelangelo Merisi died on the southern coast of Tuscany. Recently, a team of Italian forensic investigators made the international news by claiming to have discovered his bones. By all accounts, he died miserably – the latest, not very plausible suggestion, being that lead poisoning had something to do with it. Murder has also been suspected. The earliest accounts describe a fatal attack of impatience, causing him to pursue on foot along the scorching coast a boat that was carrying his baggage away. Whatever the cause, the deceased was the great artist better known to posterity as Caravaggio. He was 38 years old.
Four hundred years later, he is, by many indications, the world's favourite old master. Canadian researcher Philip Sohm has established that in the past 50 years, Caravaggio has overtaken that other Michelangelo – Buonarroti – as the favourite subject of art historical research. More, it seems, has been written about him in the past half century than any other artist.
This extraordinary level of attention invites the question: why? One answer lies in the sensational details of his life. Caravaggio committed at least one homicide – for which he was returning to Rome to receive pardon from the Pope when he died. He was involved in numerous brawls and made a dramatic escape from prison on the island of Malta.
But, though all this makes for a gripping biographical story, such behaviour was not that unusual for an artist of that era. The 16th-century goldsmith and sculptor Benvenuto Cellini proudly relates in his autobiography the numerous assaults and murders he committed. These deeds have not, however, made Cellini the contemporary art historical hero that Caravaggio is.
A deeper reason can be found in Caravaggio's work itself. There is a dark mixture of violence and sexuality that appeals to the sensibility of an age that relishes the art of Francis Bacon and Quentin Tarantino. As the art historian Robert Hughes pointed out, you can see from the way the executioner holds his knife in Beheading of St John the Baptist that Caravaggio knew precisely the most brutally effective way to wield a weapon.
It is clear from Caravaggio's record that he had first-hand experience of lethal force. His court appearances on charges including affray from one of the sources of information about his life. Contemporaries who criticised his work linked his turbulent character with his art. “Driven by his own nature,” wrote one, “he retreated to the dark style that is connected to his disturbed and contentious temperament.”
But there is a more profound reason still for the fascination Caravaggio exerts over the 21st century: he carried out one of the most startling revolutions in the history of art, and one that still seems strangely modern. The visceral violence and eroticism of his work are only an aspect of the extraordinary realism he achieved. His painting was utterly different from that of his predecessors and contemporaries. It looks, to put it in modern terms, like a film noir. As David Hockney has put it: “He invented a black world that had not existed before, certainly not in Florence or Rome. Caravaggio invented Hollywood lighting.” And that resemblance may be no accident.
Caravaggio's art was hugely influential and immensely controversial. Younger artists imitated him, older painters vehemently disapproved. As a result, all the early biographies are hostile, which may be why they emphasise the painter's violent behaviour and eccentricity. One of the earliest was written by Giovanni Baglione, a conventional academic painter who had sued Caravaggio for libel.
Baglione said of Caravaggio: “At times he would speak badly of the painters of the past, and also of the present, no matter how distinguished they were, because he thought that he alone had surpassed all the other artists in his profession.” In other words, Caravaggio behaved like a man who believed he had made a great discovery: who understood something others did not. This was a source of some resentment for Baglione who felt that he had “destroyed the art of painting”.
The case against Caravaggio was stated frequently. On the one hand, as Francesco Scannelli, another contemporary, wrote, he produced pictures of “terrible naturalism ... astonishing deceptions, which attracted and ravished human sight”. On the other, his work broke many rules of Renaissance composition as they had been passed down from Raphael and Michelangelo.
Scannelli complained that “he lacked the necessary basis for good design, producing faulty creations”. Giovanni Bellori, writing in the 17th century, noted that more conservative artists complained that Caravaggio, “painted all his figures with a single source of light and on one plane without any diminution; but such accusations did not stop the flight of his fame”.
There was reason for both the praise and the criticism. Caravaggio achieved levels of realism for which the word “photographic” seems inevitable – consider the still life The Supper at Emmaus, for example. It is true that his paintings are full of faults that a competent 16th or 17th-century artist wouldn't usually make. His figures don't occupy a consistent space. Some are so crowded they appear to be in the same spot – as in his The Entombment of Christ. Often it is unclear which of two figures is in front. Anatomical oddities occur: the arms of Judas in The Taking of Christ is grotesquely short.
The reason for all this is evident. He wasn't using a conventional method to put a painting together. The standard procedure was to evolve an idealised composition through a series of drawings. Caravaggio didn't draw at all – or not a single drawing by him survives. Instead, he seems to have worked directly on the canvas, transcribing from reality, with blemishes, imperfections and dirty feet, a detail that infuriated his critics, included. “He claimed,” Bellori wrote, “that he imitated his models so closely that he never made a single brushstroke that he called his own, but said rather that it was nature's.”
The only preparatory marks Caravaggio made were rough incisions on the canvas that have been compared with the chalk marks used to fix a model's pose on a floor. From quite early in his career, he took to using a single strong source of light that illuminates his figures against darkness, like a theatrical spotlight.
What could explain all these stylistic oddities? It seems possible, indeed plausible, as has been proposed by Hockney and others, that Caravaggio was using some sort of optical equipment. According to this theory, he was using a device to project the image of his subject on to the canvas.
In effect, he pieced his compositions together from a series of vivid fragments thrown by a mirror and/or lens, in other words, a form of camera obscura. His work would then have been a sort of collage of quasi-photographic close ups – which is indeed exactly what it looks like.
The use of the camera obscura by artists was advocated by the Italian writer Giambattista della Porta in a best-selling book entitled Natural Magick (1584). Della Porta was in communication with Caravaggio's patron Cardinal del Monte.
The art historian and dealer Clovis Whitfield, writing in the introduction to the catalogue of Caravaggio's Friends and Foes exhibition at Whitfield Fine Art in London, suggests that in the early 17th century “such images... must have created as much wonder and amazement as 3D movies do today”. The science of optics was a hot topic of the day, and also a dangerous one. Della Porta found himself before the Inquisition and his books were banned in the 1590s. In 1600, Giordano Bruno was burned alive in Rome, in part for his scientific activities. If Caravaggio was using such methods, there would have been every reason to keep it quiet.
This idea remains highly controversial. To accept it would involve something like a paradigm shift in art history. Many feel that for an old master to have worked in this way would have been cheating. Hockney thinks the reverse: “What Caravaggio was doing wasn't easy, in fact it was wonderfully creative. It's a very clever way to make a picture, very skilful, very original.”
Smoking-gun proof is lacking, but the camera obscura hypothesis explains a great deal about Caravaggio's work, and life – the whiff of mystery and brimstone that hung about his reputation, for example.
Personally, I was impressed by a demonstration of the method Hockney suggests Caravaggio used. Hockney's assistant, David Graves, stood outside in strong sunlight while his image was transmitted via a mirror and lens into a darkened room where I stood. He appeared upside down, and in a dark void (the result of the optical process). The colours of his face richly saturated as in a 17th-century painting. The effect was startlingly like a Caravaggio.
Putting the hijab on was only the beginning. I soon realized it is not just a piece of cloth on my head, but a spiritual journey to the Almighty; I could feel my love of Allah increasing daily. He soon blessed me to go on Ziyarat to visit Lady Zainab (peace be upon her), and upon my return I found within myself a strong craving to gain Islamic knowledge. I began learning what I did not know, and things I once thought I knew.
Ramadan – the month of spiritual reform. It is the month that I finally decided to wear the hijab. My thoughts were full of worries about what would happen if I began to wear it; I would be recognized as a Muslim everywhere I go. Having grown up amongst non-Muslims whilst living in the west made me afraid to express my culture, because I felt I would not be accepted.
Throughout my school years I experienced different forms of discrimination and intolerance, much of it enforcing my fear to wear the hijab. Senior year came and a feeling of emptiness spread inside me. I thought maybe there was something worldly I was missing out on. I knew I was in need of a spiritual change, and that I must begin to wear the hijab, but I ignored it.
I relied on worldly matters to take the feelings of emptiness away. If only I had known of the Hadith of Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq (peace be upon him) in which he said, “This world is like seawater, the more you drink the more you get thirsty.” And let us think, what is the effect of seawater on the one who drinks it? There are elements in it which cause insanity. Indeed, relying on worldly things to quench our thirst and solve our problems will cause us nothing but distress.
Throughout those days at school I knew I was committing sin, and I can even remember a moment where I could feel Allah watching me directly. My heart was saddened, but Shaytan told me to ignore it; he was trying to convince me that this world will provide me with all that I needed. Yet Imam Sadiq's words will always ring true – it will never be enough.
As senior year came to an end I felt as if I was awakening form my slumber; my eyes were finally opening, and regret for my actions consumed me. I began to repent to Allah asking Him to bring me back to His Mercy and Love. I gave up music, and this time seriously considered wearing the hijab. I wanted the emptiness to disappear and my thirst to be quenched.
It was in the month of Ramadan that Allah helped me gain the courage to wear it. He allowed me to meet some very encouraging sisters who impacted my life greatly. I began to observe hijab in the second week of Ramadan, and I knew instantly that this was what my heart had been yearning for.
The day I put it on, not a single person spoke against me for wearing it, and it was then that I realized all my fears were whispers of Shaytan. My friends did not question me, and instead I felt I had gained respect. I fell in love with my hijab.
But putting the hijab on was only the beginning. I soon realized it is not just a piece of cloth on my head, but a spiritual journey to the Almighty; I could feel my love of Allah increasing daily. He soon blessed me to go on Ziyarat to visit Lady Zainab (peace be upon her), and upon my return I found within myself a strong craving to gain Islamic knowledge. I began learning what I did not know, and things I once thought I knew.
Let us make this Ramadan one in which we abandon our sinful ways and ask Allah to help us gain nearness to Him in our hearts. To my sisters who are struggling to wear the hijab: if you sincerely ask Allah for help, while also making the effort to change, He will certainly help you in the best of ways. And to my brothers: do remember to lower your gaze.
This world is only temporary, while Love for Allah is eternal. Love for Him is the best of feelings and the highest form of love, for He wants nothing from us, but everything for us – so let us develop the God-consciousness in our hearts to practice all that He has made obligatory, and guard ourselves from all that He has made forbidden.
Granted, TCL's DTEK 50 and 60 phones were also all-screen, but this is different. Details are, perhaps obviously, fairly scarce about the as-yet unannounced device, but we managed to glean tidbits from TCL's François Mahieu. Mahieu explains that TCL will respect BlackBerry's reputation for building hard-wearing devices for clumsy international travelers who will be working in all weathers. The main feature, beyond the full-touchscreen, is the (planned) IP67 water and dust-proofing, as well as a battery rated to last for more than 26 hours of mixed use. Mahieu believes that durability and longevity will be two of the biggest selling points, a long-lasting phone that'll keep going long after your iPhone has conked out.
Mahieu feels bold enough to claim that he expects a number of iPhone and Galaxy users to "make the switch" to BlackBerry come October. Of course, these handsets now run Android, which means that it's far harder to make it stand out from the crowd. Mahieu continues to believe that BlackBerry's security know-how will enable TCL to deliver the "most secure Android phone in the world." Although given the failure of so many ultra-secure Android devices to sell, his confidence seems — at least right now — misplaced.
But TCL is used to combating cynicism with people looking down their nose at BlackBerry in its new after-life as a white label brand. Mahieu said that users shouldn't write off BlackBerry just because it doesn't stand toe-to-toe against Apple and Samsung. "We are there to play," he explained, "we're just playing with different cards," mostly by pushing its strengths of battery life, security and durability. As for pricing, it's likely that the device will cost less than other flagships.
Of course, we've already seen a BlackBerry device with a large display unencumbered by a physical keyboard. The Priv hid its physical input device in its slider, and so could actually work as a phone for touchscreen devotees. And given how well that device sold — prompting BlackBerry to abandon producing hardware altogether — it's going to be interesting to see how TCL can avoid history repeating.
TCL is banking on certified water and dust-resistance as a draw, and it's not clear how many people were waiting for that as a reason to make the switch. But Mahieu is hinting that the company is "marching towards millions" of device sales, although it's not clear how many models it needs to shift before it can be considered a success.

California Democrat Rep. Ted Lieu tweeted Monday, “We are #DeepState” and suggested that government workers, journalists, and teachers are part of a movement to undermine President Trump.
“We are whistleblowers, press, judges, legislators, cooks, teachers. We are #DeepState. We are the American people,” Lieu tweeted:
We are whistleblowers, press, judges, legislators, cooks, teachers. We are #DeepState. We are the American people. https://t.co/Ns9ZcP4Ja6 — Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 6, 2017
The tweet comes amid speculation over whether the Obama administration had wiretapped Trump campaign officials before the election and whether there is a larger effort by former Obama officials and holdovers to undermine him.
During the weekend, Trump raised the question of illegal wiretapping in a series of tweets.
“Is it legal for a sitting President to be ‘wire tapping' a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!” he tweeted Saturday morning.
Trump's first two months in office has been beset by leaks from within the government that have caused turmoil inside his administration.
Some Trump critics have mocked the idea of a “deep state” trying to undermine him, but Lieu's tweet lends credence to the idea.
He also advocated for “all patriots” to resist Trump.
“Danger posed by @realDonaldTrump requires all patriots to #resist. Our new motto should be “When they go low, we fight back.” #WakeUpAmerica,” he tweeted on Saturday:
Danger posed by @realDonaldTrump requires all patriots to #resist. Our new motto should be "When they go low, we fight back." #WakeUpAmerica — Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 4, 2017
A day before, Lieu had encouraged government officials to leak to the press, posting a “how to” guide on doing so:
Are you a whistleblower & upset at all the lies from the Trump Admin? How to leak to press: https://t.co/IjTar3hv6U #employeeappreciationday — Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 3, 2017
Lieu was promoted to a colonel in the Air Force Reserves and is subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which prohibits him from “contemptuous words” against the president and other high officials, whether he is in or out of uniform.
It does not, however, prohibit mere criticism, where he may have wiggle room.
Lieu has also claimed that Trump is both an illegitimate president and in violation of the Constitution and has posted on his website a “Cloud of Illegitimacy Clock,” which measures the length of his “illegitimate” term, as reported by Breitbart News.

SAN ANTONIO — A judge said Monday he won't immediately rule on whether a lawsuit over the controversial shooting of University of the Incarnate Word honors student Robert Cameron Redus by a campus police officer should be tried in state or federal court.
Redus' parents sued the University and campus police Cpl. Christopher Carter in state court earlier this year. But UIW moved it to federal court, arguing that the lawsuit alleges Carter violated Redus' civil rights.
The Redus family says their suit only alleges state claims of negligence and wrongful death and want it back in state court. Litigation in federal court takes longer to get to trial because of a backlog of cases and a shortage of judges.
On Friday, UIW asked a federal judge to keep the public from accessing an audio and video recording of the Dec. 6, 2013 encounter in which Carter fatally shot Redus outside Redus' Alamo Heights apartment in the early morning, after he claimed he saw Redus driving erratically.
Alamo Heights Police Department previously denied release of the recording to the public, citing an ongoing investigation.
Read details of how UIW is moving to keep the audio and video recording of the shooting private here or in Monday's print edition, and read details of Monday's hearing in Tuesday's print edition.

QPR director of football Les Ferdinand has revealed the club have been flooded with applications for the manager's job and hope to make an appointment within a month.
Neil Warnock was put in charge at Loftus Road after Chris Ramsey was fired a fortnight ago, but Ferdinand insists it will be on a temporary basis.
However, Warnock still remains one of the favourites for the post, along with former Leicester boss Nigel Pearson, Burton Albion's Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink as well as Brendan Rodgers, who was sacked by Liverpool last month. QPR fans' favourite Ian Holloway is also in the running and Ferdinand is aware of the importance of the decision.
Ferdinand told Standard Sport: “We are in the process of interviewing people and getting a shortlist of names together. There have been loads who have applied from all round Europe.
“There is no rush. We have Neil Warnock in charge who will be in the job until we get someone in. We have to make sure it's the right man.”

*Editor's Note: March 2018. I know a lot of visitors are reading this article to better understand Canadian gun laws and what firearms we can legally own. If I can convince you to spend 5 minutes reading more information, I'd highly encourage you to check out my article on Canadian Gun Stats and my article on twisting gun stats. I think that it's important to note that while we have a lot of “scary looking” guns in Canada like the ones below, they're extremely rarely used in crime.
Black rifles, some hunters love em, some hate em, but we've undeniably benefited from the technology gleaned from them and some of them make for handy hunting rifles. I'd love to take my AR15 out hunting, especially considering all the cool AR15 parts we can get in Canada, but I can't because it's restricted. See my top 10 restricted firearms list if you're looking for restricted or check out my list of top Canadian Pistol Caliber Carbines (PCC.) I thought I'd count down the top 10 non restricted black rifles in Canada. Some of these would be great for deer, while others would be fantastic little coyote blasters. To get this list, I surveyed some Canadians (survey's closed now, you had your chance).
#1: Stag 10S
The Stag 10S is similar to an AR10, but importantly not compatible. Stag is well known for high quality parts and you can get a Stag 10S in 308 or 6.5 Creedmoor, as a finished rifle, or as just an upper and lower set. Stripped upper/lower sets are $600, while finished rifles go for $1800-$2200.
Another rifle we had access to before the Americans but now are made state-side. The Canadian Tavors are almost all Israeli made with a barrel length that satisfies non-restricted status. The Tavor is a high quality bullpup that has seen rave reviews here and in the US. If you want to see it in action, check out Jerry Miculek's video review. The Tavor is about $2300 and comes in 223.
The Wolverine Supplies WK180C is a non restricted AR180B clone that's been upgraded with better quality parts (aluminum lower, free float aluminum forend, railed top, etc). For about $1100, they're a steal. Read my review for more info.
#4: X95
The upgraded version of the Tavor Tar21, the X95 is more compact and ergonomic. It comes in 223 and has a 9mm conversion kit available. The x95 is about $2650.
For a good long time, the Robinson Arms XCR was the reigning non restricted black rifle leader, with the 223 XCR-L and the 308 sized XCR-M. With the recent release of more AR-ish NR rifles, it's slipped a few spots. The XCR-L is about $2500, while the XCR-M is $3200. Check out my review
#6: Modern Sporter
The ATRS Modern Sporter is a non restricted stripped upper/lower available from Alberta Tactical Rifle Supply for about $1000. They maintain parts compatibility with most AR15 parts, so you build your own.
The original CZ858 was popular in Canada because you could get a rifle and 4 mags for $650. Those days are gone, but these days, we have the VZ58 in 223 or 7.62×39. These rifles go for about $1200. See my review on the WK762, a Canadian made version of the CZ858.
#8: Maccabee SLR
The Maccabee SLR is a non restricted stripped upper/lower going for about $1000. They maintain parts compatibility with most AR15 parts, so you build your own.
#9: BCL-102
The BCL 102 is a Canadian made rifle in 308 (uppers in 6.5 Creedmoor are available). Going for around $1400, they're relatively inexpensive and share a lot of parts compatibility with the AR1o and AR15.
#10: Modern Hunter
The ATRS Modern Hunter is also a Canadian made rifle in 308 and they use a side charging handle. They're custom made to fit for around $3600.
#11: SG542
This Chilean-built, SIG-designed rifle will definitely turn some heads. It's a 308 rifle similar to the Swiss PE90, and they're around $2600.
#12: ACR
The Bushmaster ACR is a high quality military style rifle in 223. Here in Canada, the DMR version is available as a non restricted rifle and it's around $3200.
#13: Swiss Arms PE90/SG550
The Swiss Arms PE90 (black special/classic green) rifle is a high quality, accurate Swiss rifle in 5.56/223. They're a bit heavy, but they have an incorporated bipod in the forend. They're about $3700.
#14: HK SL8
The SL8 is a non restricted, semi-auto only version of the G36. It uses a short stroke gas piston and is chambered in 223. They're about $2100.
The Norinco M14s is one of the rifles that makes our American compatriots green with envy. For a mere $600-$700, we can get a 308 semi automatic rifle that's built for reliability and can be tuned for accuracy. While the fit, finish, and head spacing can be on the rough side, the forged receivers are worth the price all on their own. Copies come in shorty 18.5″ barrels and regular 22″ barrels.
Strengths: cheap, can be accurate, powerful enough for deer and other big game, great aftermarket support, cheap magazines.
Weaknesses: factory headspace commonly quite generous, expensive scope mounts, accuracy enhancing aluminum stocks are heavy, barrels indexing can be off on some, the manual safety sucks.
Who sells Norinco M14s: Cabela's, Calgary Shooting Centre, Wolverine Supplies, FOC, Bullseye London, and many local gun stores.
#16: Type 97
M14.ca does a flat top upper for the original T97, there's a V2 T97 that includes a flat top from the factory, and M14.ca also has an upgraded lower.
Strengths: Cheap bullpup, early reports indicate very good accuracy of 2-4 MOA, may replace pistol carbines for non-restricted fun, flat side feels great when slung.
Weaknesses: Bullpup triggers usually aren't as great as others, ergonomics on mag release/safety are pretty bad, carry handle and top charger design precludes a decently low optics mount (solution now available), no forward rails, not ambidextrous, some mags are very tight/impossible to get in.
#17: Type 81
The wait is over, and they're in Canada now. The Chinese Type 81 is in Canada as the T81SA, imported by Tactical Imports. Semi automatic, 7.62x39mm.
Strengths: Inexpensive AK mags can be modified to use, safety is in the right spot, pretty beefy action, cheaper than some of the other AK-ish rifles, last shot bolt hold open.
Weaknesses: Because it's new, there isn't much aftermarket for it yet, longer action than the VZ58, no option for scopes, short sight radius.
Who sells Type 81's in Canada?: Tactical Imports, places that stock TI stuff.
The AR180B was Armalites way of remaking their AR18 in an even more inexpensive format. It had a polymer lower, incorporated grip, but you could get some aftermarket accessories. When these first came to Canada, they were $1000. They quickly rose in price when there were no other NR black rifles, but the used market has cooled off with other rifles like the WK180C now available.

There's a mouse in the house — along with a long-lost 20th-century masterpiece.
An art historian was watching the movie “Stuart Little” with his daughter — and spotted in the background a painting long believed lost, it was reported Friday.
“I could not believe my eyes when I saw Bereny's long-lost masterpiece on the wall behind Hugh Laurie,” said Gergely Barki, a researcher at the Hungarian National Gallery in Budapest who made the discovery on Christmas in 2009.
“Sleeping Lady with Black Vase,” an avant-garde work by Hungarian painter Robert Bereny, was last seen in public in 1928 — and wound up as a prop in the 1999 children's movie, starring Michael J. Fox (as the voice of the titular mouse), Geena Davis, Laurie and Jonathan Lipnicki.
“A researcher can never take his eyes off the job, even when watching Christmas movies at home,” Barki, who is writing a biography on Bereny, told Agence France-Presse.
In the film, the painting hangs over the fireplace in the Little family's New York City apartment.
“It was not just on screen for one second but in several scenes of the film, so I knew I was not dreaming. It was a very happy moment,” said Barki, 43, who knew the work from a faded photo taken in 1928.
“I started to write e-mails to everyone involved in the film.”
He eventually tracked down a set-designer assistant, who, unaware of the piece's significance, bought it as a prop for $500 at an antique shop in Pasadena, Calif.
“She had snapped it up for next to nothing,” Barki said.
She liked it so much she bought it from the studio for herself.
“It was hanging on her bedroom wall in Washington,” Barki said. “Within a year, I had a chance to visit her and see the painting and tell her everything about the painter. She was very surprised.”
Bereny was part The Eight, a group of the avant-garde Hungarian painters. In 1920, he fled to Berlin where he had a love affair with the actress Marlene Dietrich.
Barki guessed the piece's original buyer was Jewish and left Hungary before or during World War II.
The film assistant sold the painting to an art collector, who will auction it Dec. 13 in Budapest with a starting price of $110,000.
While Barki hasn't profited from the work's rediscovery, his book on the artist will benefit.
“It means that I can make a more complete publication of [Bereny's] oeuvre catalog,” he said.

You know those FBI warning messages that appear at the beginning of DVDs and Blu-ray discs? They're getting an upgrade—and they're multiplying.
The US government yesterday rolled out not one but two copyright notices, one to "warn" and one to "educate." Six major movie studios will begin using the new notices this week.
The main change is that Immigrations & Customs Enforcement (ICE) has, in the last several years, made itself a key player in the copyright wars. The FBI has shown extremely limited interest in going after individual websites, but ICE has done so with gusto; it has so far seized more than 750 domain names after rightsholder complaints. This new prominence is reflected in the broader logos used.
ICE now appears on both notices. The first notice shows the traditional FBI seal and a warning that "the unauthorized reproduction or distribution of this copyrighted work is illegal. Criminal copyright infringement is investigated by federal law enforcement agencies and is punishable by up to 5 years in prison and a fine of $250,000." The logo for ICE's Homeland Security Investigations unit now appears beside the FBI's.
The second notice shows the logo for the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center, which involves 20 different US government agencies. It features one extremely angry eagle who would probably pluck your eyeballs from your sockets if he could get those talons near you. "Piracy is not a victimless crime," says the notice. "For more information on how digital theft harms the economy, please visit www.iprcenter.gov."
Will the two screens be shown back to back? Will each screen last for 10 seconds each? Will each screen be unskippable? Yes, yes, and yes.
An ICE spokesman tells me that the two screens will "come up after the previews, once you hit the main movie/play button on the DVD. At which point the movie rating comes up, followed by the IPR Center screen shot for 10 secs and then the FBI/HSI anti-piracy warning for 10 secs as well. Neither can be skipped/fast forwarded through."
The idea isn't to deter current pirates, apparently (the new scheme requires all legal purchasers to sit through 20 seconds of warnings each time they pop in a film, but will be totally absent from pirated downloads and bootlegs). It's to educate everyone else. As ICE Director John Morton announced in a statement yesterday, "Law enforcement must continue to expand how it combats criminal activity; public awareness and education are a critical part of that effort."
Lee Angol enjoyed a perfect debut as Lincoln City extended their lead at the top of the National League to six points with a comprehensive win over Braintree Town.
The striker, who arrived on loan from Peterborough earlier in the week, scored a hat-trick as the FA Cup quarter-finalists made it 10 games unbeaten.
Angol marked his Imps debut with a goal after just 15 minutes as he converted from a corner.
The striker thumped in a second seven minutes later with a low effort, and completed his hat-trick eight minutes from time after Matt Rhead was fouled in the penalty area by Frankie Musonda.
Nathan Arnold got in on the act five minutes from time with a clinical finish, as Braintree failed to register an effort on target until stoppage time.

ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- When some of the NFL's officials rolled through the Denver Broncos complex during training camp to enlighten the team's coaches and players on the rules changes for the season as well as the "points of emphasis," the Broncos saw one of their own on the training video shown to every team in the league.
In the portion of the video that discussed centers moving their heads or their hands too much before the snap in an effort to get defensive players to jump offside, it was the Broncos' Manny Ramirez who was used as the example of what not to do.

And after five offside penalties on Broncos defensive players Sunday, head coach John Fox believes not everybody got the memo, citing some “abrupt'' movements from Kansas City Chiefs center Rodney Hudson.
Asked Monday for the root of four different defensive players being flagged for five offside penalties in Sunday's 24-17 Broncos win, Fox said:
"They might have been a little abrupt. [That's] something we're, of course, going to turn in. I can't speak about it, but we'll turn it in."
One of those penalties, from defensive end Quanterus Smith late in the fourth quarter, negated an interception return for a touchdown by Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib. Fox also didn't let his own players off the hook, either, as defensive end DeMarcus Ware was flagged twice to go with one penalty each for Smith, Von Miller and Terrance Knighton.
Because of crowd noise at Sports Authority Field at Mile High, the Chiefs used a silent count for much of the game -- "There was no cadence," Fox said.
"After maybe one or two, think we probably should have adjusted a little better," Fox said. "[But] the squatting and turning of the head fairly abruptly, you know, was something that we'll make sure the league knows about."
Asked about the team viewing the training video this summer, Fox added: "Yeah, something we made people aware of. It didn't work out so good."
"They had a really good snap count," Ware said. "There's no excuse, it's watching the ball. But when you have a lot of movement before the snap of the ball, you get a little antsy."
Last season the Broncos' defense was flagged for five offside penalties all year.
Before the season, officials were told to flag centers under the guidelines that "prior to the snap, any quick, or abrupt movement by any offensive players, or several offensive players in unison, which simulates the start of a play, is a foul."
The league's directive also said among the things to be penalized was to be "a center abruptly lifting or dropping his head not immediately followed by the snap."
In the league's training video it was Ramirez who was shown quickly dropping his head without snapping the ball.
The NFL made it a point of emphasis given there were 33 neutral zone infractions by defenders flagged in 2005. Last season there were 132. Last year Broncos opponents were flagged seven times for neutral zone infractions and three for being offside.
6 Washington & Fairfield County, Connecticut
A lot of people have never heard of Washington, CT–but that's okay by me! My mom has a house up there and there is shockingly still no cell service, which is even better for maximum de-stressing. For an afternoon of unwinding, The Mayflower Grace is just around the corner from us and they've got a killer spa. If you have a hankering for Japanese food, check out Norimaki in town; it shockingly rivals lots of sushi spots in NYC. For some amazing tchotchkes or dinner party gifts, drive over to Privet House, which also stocks my dad's favorite shaving cream from Musgo. - Caroline Solomon, Digital Beauty Associate
My favorite long weekend destination is Fairfield County, where I grew up. It's the best place to get out of the city, without going too far. When I'm home, I love walking around downtown Westport for shopping and having lunch on the water at BarTaco, or venturing out to New Haven for a quick traipse around the Yale campus. - Lauren McCarthy, Fashion News/Features Editor

Last year at the Milan Expo, artist Wolfgang Buttress created a structure called the UK Pavilion—a sort of giant honeycomb. The piece glowed in conjunction with the live streaming sounds of an actual beehive. The new album One is a companion to that structure, and it features original music where members of Spiritualized improvise alongside actual bees.
The album, out February 12 via Rivertones, was recorded by Be—a collective led by the duo Kev Bales and Doggen Foster (who have both worked with Spiritualized). The record features Spiritualized's Jason Pierce and John Coxon, Amiina (the Icelandic group who have recorded and toured with Sigur Rós), Youth, cellist Deirdre Bencsik, and vocalist Camille Buttress. The musicians improvised in the key of D along to the beehive audio feed. Listen to a sample of the album above.
On February 18 and 19, a 12-piece band of musicians behind the album will perform in Nottingham, England. It's described as a "multisensory experience" and it takes place at the Nottingham Arts Theatre.

An Obama administration memo has had a “chilling effect” on the government's compliance with open records laws, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee argued Tuesday.
Launching a two-day hearing on the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Rep. Jason Chaffetz Jason ChaffetzTop Utah paper knocks Chaffetz as he mulls run for governor: ‘His political career should be over' Boehner working on memoir: report Former GOP lawmaker on death of 7-year-old migrant girl: Message should be ‘don't make this journey, it will kill you' MORE (R-Utah) blasted an email that directs federal agencies to consult with President Obama's general counsel following any document request that could involve the White House.
“If you've got the yahoos at the White House having to review every document that falls under FOIA,” Chaffetz said. “This is the heart of the backlog.”
ADVERTISEMENT
The memo, dated April 2009, applies to any documents that may have “White House equities.” Chaffetz suggested the memo is being used as an excuse to delay the release of documents.
“No, no, no, don't fulfill the FOIA request,” Chaffetz said of the memo. “Send it here to the White House. We have equities! The White House equities!”
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said the memo has made federal employees fearful of crossing the White House.
"If the White House general counsel tells all general counsels at every federal agency, 'Hey, hey, before you send anything, check with us,' of course they're going to redact it. They're scared to death," he said.
Democrats defended the administration's compliance with FOIA, with Rep. Gerry Connolly Gerald (Gerry) Edward ConnollyDem rep hopes Omar can be 'mentored,' remain on Foreign Affairs panel Fairfax removed from leadership post in lieutenant governors group Virginia Legislative Black Caucus calls on Fairfax to step down MORE (D-Va.) noting that the Reagan Administration sent out a similar directive.
“If it wasn't right in the [Reagan] administration, it's not right in the Obama administration,” Chaffetz replied.
“I don't care who's in the White House, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong. It has a chilling effect, it slows people down, it sends a signal to those who are on the front lines … ‘Don't you give that that to The New York Times.'”
The White House and House Democrats pushed back at suggestions that the Obama administration has lowered the bar for FOIA responses, suggesting that Republican budget cuts are partly to blame.
“Is there any wonder why we have FOIA backlogs? The number of requests has been skyrocketing, but agency budgets have been slashed by draconian sequestration cuts — resulting in fewer staff to handle impossible workloads,” said Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform.
Earlier this year, an Associated Press audit found that the Obama administration had set a new record for censoring, delaying access or denying information requested under FOIA.
By the end of 2014, the amount of unanswered FOIA requests had soared 55 percent over the previous year, to more than 200,000. The report noted that the staff handling requests fell 9 percent, by 375 employees, during the same period.
While Cummings praised FOIA as “the cornerstone of our open government laws,” he also said delays in the system need to be addressed.
He has partnered with former Oversight Chair Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) to push FOIA reform legislation that would, in part, codify the White House's earlier directive of increased transparency.
The legislation, FOIA Oversight and Implementation Act, recently passed through the oversight panel and has 41 additional co-sponsors.
Connolly in a statement decried the hearing as partisan, saying it appears “designed to provide a venue to attack the administration under the guise of conducting serious oversight.”
“Government transparency would be better served by Congress taking concrete, pragmatic action,” he said in his written statement, before urging the passage of the pending FOIA reform bill.
The White House also snapped back at criticisms of the FOIA compliance process, saying on Tuesday it was “justifiably proud” of its efforts to fulfill open records requests.
Press secretary Josh Earnest said the administration has responded to 647,000 requests in the last fiscal year, while noting Congress is exempt from a similar burden.
“Those who are interested in advocating for transparency in government should advocate for Congress being subject to those kinds of transparency measures,” Earnest told reporters.
While most of the White House's operations are exempt from FOIA, Earnest noted that their communications are subjected to an archive process under the Presidential Records Act.
“Certainly [there is] a much greater demonstration of a commitment to transparency than what Congress submits itself to,” Earnest said. “I think what we want is some kind of transparency in Congress.”
Jason Leopold, an investigative reporter at Vice News who testified as a witness, said during the hearing on Tuesday that FOIA offices have never cited budgetary constraints as a reason for delays or complications in fulfilling document requests.
"I've never heard of it impacting my ability to access records," he said, while noting that it's possible that it could have an effect.

The upgraded iRobot's 110 FirstLook throwable bot is now more dextrous than ever before.
iRobot's 110 FirstLook robot, a helper in the military since 2012, is known for its ability to bounce into action after being flung through a window of an unexplored building. But for its first tours of duty, all it could do was transmit photos and video. Now, the little bot has been tricked out with a suite of tools so that it can contribute more to the team.
The new version of the 110 FirstLook can still drop 16 feet onto solid concrete and keep running, but now it can carry a thermal camera or chemical sensor, to collect and send back information to the team controlling it. The other addition to the robot is a manipulator arm, which can be put to use assisting bomb detection teams that need to inspect or make contact with explosive ordnance, iRobot claims.
"If they need to investigate wires, cut wires or remove them, that's something they need a manipulator for," Mark Belanger, iRobot's director of DoD Robotics Products told NBC News. iRobot claims the the robot can lift 3 pounds and extend by 12 inches. "In its size class, it's the most capable multi-mission robot," Belanger said.
The upgraded FirstLook is joining a legion of customizable, hardy, multi-purpose ground robots.
For example, the Throwbot, built by Recon Robotics, can survive a launch up to 118 feet high. It is primarily a stealth surveillance system, which moves very quietly through a building, beaming back an audio and video feed.
Military teams more often send out larger PackBot and Talon-3B robots to help detonate improvised explosive devises, and often the bots take the hit instead of the humans. Systems like QinetiQ's MAARS robot can carry cameras, speakers, or even a weapons system . But a gun is something the FirstLook is too small to carry, Belanger said.

The Ku Klux Klan played an active and enduring role in steering southern white voters away from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party, according to a new study.
The white supremacist group resurged to prominence in the 1960s as a reaction to the civil rights movement, and its violent extremism inflamed racial division and polarized communities for generations, according to the study published by the American Sociological Review.
“It encouraged white voters to prioritize the defense of white supremacy when making voting decisions, upending long-standing Democratic Party allegiances,” wrote the study's authors.
The researchers — David Cunningham, professor and chair of the Department of Sociology at Brandeis University, Rory McVeigh of the University of Notre Dame and Justin Farrell of Yale University — studied county voting records in 10 southern states where the KKK actively recruited members in the 1960s.
Analysis of voting outcomes of five presidential elections between 1960 and 2000 showed a statistically significant increase in GOP voting compared to counties with no established KKK chapter, even after filtering out a range of other factors that could influence voting preferences.
The researchers also found that a poll conducted in 1992, “decades after the Klan's decline, [showed] conservative racial attitudes strongly predict southerners' Republican voting, but only in counties where the Klan was organized in the 1960s.”
KKK chapters were more likely to be formed in strongly Democratic counties earlier in the civil rights movement, which reflected the long-standing link between southern Democrats and white supremacists.
But that political bond began unraveling as the national Democratic Party became increasingly aligned with the black civil rights struggle, and many of those former Democratic voters backed Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964 and third-party anti-desegregation candidate George Wallace 1968.
The study found that counties with a Klan chapter were much more likely to back those two candidates, and adjacent counties without an active KKK chapter of their own were also more likely to support Goldwater and Wallace.
“The Klan played an active role in encouraging white southerners to prioritize white supremacy over party loyalty,” wrote the study's authors.
KKK leaders urged southerners to “form a voting bloc to defeat any n*gger-loving politician that runs for office,” and the group evaluated and supported candidates based on their “authentic whiteness” rather than party ties.
This was a significant change from the Democratic Party loyalty that had assured white political dominance since the end of the Civil War.
“The very idea of uncompromising party loyalty was wedded to the logic of white supremacy,” the researchers found.
The Klan spread its message at rallies that regularly attracted more than a thousand spectators – most of whom were sympathizers or curious onlookers, rather than formal members – and the intense debate over the group's activities reached residents who didn't even attend.
Klan organizations were more likely to be formed in populous counties with high rates of home ownership and a higher percentage of black residents, and they attracted more participation in less-prosperous counties where whites were more vulnerable to economic competition.
Goldwater picked up stronger support than fellow Republican Richard Nixon had four years earlier in counties with larger black populations.
“Given the barriers to voting still in place in the South for blacks in 1964, prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act, this finding reflects high support among white voters in counties were the perceived threat posed by African-Americans to white interests was greatest,” the authors argued.
By the early 1970s, the researchers argued, “it had become increasingly clear that the national Republican Party was more in line with the interest of those opposed to civil rights than was the Democratic Party.”
When all other variables were factored out, the researchers said the average increase in Republican voting between Nixon's unsuccessful 1960 campaign and Ronald Reagan's 1980 win was 3.7 percent higher in Klan counties compared to non-Klan counties.
The Klan effect between 1960 and George H.W. Bush's 1992 unsuccessful campaign was 4.9 percent higher, and 3.4 percent higher in 2000, when his son, George W. Bush, was elected to the White House.
“The wedding of the Klan's mainly working-class constituency to the Republican Party was no simple feat in light of the strong appeal that Republican candidates hold for wealthy and upper-middle-class white southerners,” the authors argued.
White working-class southerners were more receptive to Republican economic policies because they had already broken ties to the Democratic Party due to its position on civil rights, they argued.
“The Ku Klux Klan did not succeed in defending Jim Crow, but, through its similarly polarizing character, played a role in linking its working-class constituency to a political party that strongly opposes proactive intervention of the federal government to produce greater racial and class-based equality,” the researchers said.

Story of an Aromantic Asexual
As a child, I was often told about this wonderful thing called "love". And told that everyone "falls in love". If you didn't, something was wrong with you because being alone was worse than anything. But I actually liked the idea of being alone...
I told my mom that I didn't like boys and didn't ever want to get married. She just laughed and promised me that one day I would change my mind. Of course I didn't believe her- what child my age would?
Soon, I began middle school. It surprised me a little to hear people that I had known my entire life calling others "cute" or "hot". In truth, I had no idea what they meant. How could a person be cute? People began asking me who I liked. Still as confused as ever, I replied that I didn't like anyone. Which was okay with most people.
By time I got to high school, my parents began worrying about why I didn't like guys. They seemed to think something was wrong with me or that I was afraid to tell them that I liked someone. My mom went

In a groundbreaking report, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that cannabidiol (CBD) — the relaxant property of cannabis used in medical marijuana — is beneficial for cancer, epilepsy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and many more diseases, AND should not be a scheduled drug.
According to the U.S. federal law, marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug with “no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse” alongside heroin, LSD, ecstasy, methaqualone, and peyote.
But WHO's Expert Committee on Drug Dependence [ECDD] gathered scientific evidence on therapeutic use and side effects of cannabis and cannabis components, and confirmed:
“Recent evidence from animal and human studies shows that its use could have some therapeutic value for seizures due to epilepsy and related conditions. Current evidence also shows that cannabidiol is not likely to be abused or create dependence as for other cannabinoids (such as Tetra Hydro Cannabinol (THC), for instance).
“The ECDD therefore concluded that current information does not justify scheduling of cannabidiol and postponed a fuller review of cannabidiol preparations to May 2018, when the committee will undertake a comprehensive review of cannabis and cannabis related substances.”
WHO experts also recommended imposing stronger restrictions on fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid analgesic that is similar to morphine but is 50 to 100 times more potent and has taken thousands of lives in the U.S. drug addiction epidemic.
Raul Elizalde, the Mexican father responsible for driving the Mexican government to legalize medical marijuana, told The Daily Mail:
“I'm ecstatic that these international health leaders agree that CBD is a substance that should not be scheduled and has therapeutic value for a variety of medical conditions. We look forward to continuing our conversation about its many benefits in 2018.”
The report comes after widespread declassification of cannabis in North America and Europe. In the U.S., a total of 29 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico now allow for comprehensive public medical marijuana and cannabis programs. In Europe, Greece, Czech Republic, Finland, The Netherlands, Portugal and Spain have legalized marijuana.
More than 100 peer-reviewed studies have concluded that cannabis cures cancer. Researchers at the University of Florida have found that the ‘gateway drug' is alcohol, not marijuana. In fact, the National Cancer Institute in 2015 admitted marijuana kills cancer cells naturally.
The latest WHO report adds to the already existing overwhelming evidence of the efficacy of the plant. Hopefully, the U.S. will turn the page, and stop classifying marijuana in the near future.
Nina Freeman doesn't quite know why so many of her games have been about sex. "It just kinda happened," she says. "Sex is something I think about all the time, so I guess that's why it comes out of almost everything I do."
Freeman, an independent game designer, has recently found herself at the forefront of a wave of new games that grapple with sex in novel ways. Her "vignette games" aren't interactive porn; they're quirky game designs that explore snapshots of her life, often tapping into formative experiences she had with sexuality and femininity.
Games that deal with sex in a realistic way are largely unexplored territory. Mainstream games with sex scenes like Mass Effect or God of War exist to titillate and empower. But indie designers like Freeman are pushing back, hoping to recouple sexuality and humanity by making players feel confused, awkward and vulnerable. (The games are usually available on PCs, sometimes for free, sometimes right in a web browser.) Games like Robert Yang's Hurt Me Plenty and Christine Love's Ladykiller in a Bind take similar approaches.
"There's nothing sexier than letting down your guard and seeing someone else let down their guard too," says game designer Yang.

How Do You Do It?
When she was a young girl, sex confused Nina Freeman. With little more than a handful of playground rumors (and the quick flashes of nudity in Titanic) to go on, she wasn't sure how two people could even fit together. So sometimes while her mother was out of the house, she'd try mashing her Barbie and Ken dolls together. Her game How Do You Do It? replicates those furtive experiments.
"It's a young white girl playing with Barbies," Freeman says. "So it's pretty safe as far as sex goes. There's nothing graphic to it." Her game is simple; you play it with six keys. With them, you can maneuver the dolls into positions that vaguely imitate the physicality of sex.
How Do You Do It? is an extremely short game; a session takes a few minutes at most. But in its sonnet-like brevity, it elegantly captures a quintessential bewilderment people have with their bodies, and the naturalness of sex using a veneer of comedic awkwardness. It's the Goat Simulator of intercourse.
The abstraction helped in its popularity, according to Freeman. "Some people thought the game was perverse," she said, "but most saw it for what it was: funny."
Freeman's latest game, Freshman Year, is more somber, and it hasn't yet attracted the attention that her previous work did (it was shown at festivals like Indiecade and the Independent Games Festival, for example). How Do You Do It? was approachable in its haphazard fumblings, but Freshman Year is cutting, almost precise, in its attempt to distill the frightening experience of sexual assault.
Nina Freeman
The game follows Freeman during one evening during her first year of college, when she was assaulted outside a bar. As text sprawls across vivid watercolor backgrounds, players can choose what to do. The choices, Freeman says, are meant to tap into a feeling faced by many survivors of abuse: that maybe if they'd done this or that differently, they could have avoided the whole thing.
Towards the end, Freshman Year's text changes from large blocks packed with florid descriptions to short, aggressive cuts. It creates a sense of unease, because you can't sit and process the language at your own pace. You're guided, somewhat forcefully, by events.
"People aren't used to losing agency in such a violent way, and I made it violent because that's what it is," Freeman says. It's an inversion of what we expect from videogames: Usually, it's us inflicting violence on the game world. Freeman tries to flip that script, briefly taking us through her own memories. We can analyze them a bit, but before long, that control is taken from us, just as it was taken from her that night.
Submissive, Not Passive
"Every power exchange must be negotiated," read the posters that line the walls of an electronica-fueled sex club in Robert Yang's game Hurt Me Plenty, a simulation of real-life dominant-submissive relationships that teaches players about BDSM culture.
The game begins with a classic negotiation—a handshake. (You can use a Leap Motion controller to make that experience even closer to the real thing.) You shake your hand to agree upon the intensity, clothing level, and safeword for the game's activities, or stop shaking if you disagree and want to re-negotiate the terms.
As the player, you could violate those terms. If your computer partner uses the safeword, you're expected to stop everything immediately. If you don't, the game blocks you out and displays a message: "Your partner is still recovering from the previous player's abuse and violation of boundaries." The game then locks you out of play for some amount of real-world time—typically measured in days.
It's stark and dramatic, but effective at communicating the importance of acknowledging and respecting the trust a partner places in you: you have power and violence, but with the expectation that you'll only use them within well-defined limits.
Hurt Me Plenty. Robert Yang
The game Ladykiller in a Bind explores some of the same themes, but through the eyes of both a dominant and a submissive. It's a work in progress from Christine Love, a game designer whose work is modeled on and sometimes parodies the Japanese “visual novel” genre of occasionally pornographic romance games.
Love says she plays a lot of games that deal with kinky sex, but finds that the vast majority of them put the player in a dominant role. In part, she says, it's a game design problem. “It's a lot easier to depict taking the lead in any given scenario, but again, sex is communication, and being submissive isn't the same as being passive."
By placing her audience in several distinct scenarios, Love hopes that she can underscore her view of sex as a communicative act, a metaphorical handshake.
Playing games like Yang's and Love's can feel silly, if not downright uncomfortable. That's all by design. In an email to WIRED, Yang likened his work to romantic comedies, calling them "emotional fantasies" that can be embarrassing. Admitting that you like them is an act of vulnerability, and that places us in a position where we have to admit something personal to ourselves.
"So many games lack basic emotional intelligence that what I'm doing is really radical and shocking by comparison," said Yang. In mainstream games where sex is an option, it's usually boiled down to clicking "sex" and watching a scene fade to black.
"These games simply aren't about sex," Yang says. "We pretend they are relevant to this discussion about sex games when they aren't. Can we finally stop giving a shit about 10 seconds of blue boobs in Mass Effect?"
More than anything, Yang says he wants to see games tackle sex as it actually happens in real life.
"Sex takes time," he says. "Even a quickie in the morning before work takes at least five minutes. Very few mainstream games would have the courage or the patience to let you flirt with someone, much less have sex with them for five whole minutes."
Gun pointed at foot (Shuttershock)
Do you want to know what it feels like to get shot? No? Most people don't.
But Adam Hirtle of Colorado Springs is not “most people.”
The 30 year old went to his garage, took his boot off and shot his boot. Then he put his injured boot back on and shot himself through his boot, police told the Denver Post.
“He wanted to know what it felt like to be shot,” police said in a statement reported by NBC News.
And now he knows.
Police were called to St. Francis Hospital in Colorado Springs at about 7 p.m. on Wednesday on reports that a man was hurt in an accidental gunshot wound, only to learn it was totally intentional, the Denver Post reports. He was given a court summons and released.
No one else was injured, and Hirtle's injuries were not life threatening, the Post reports.
A lot has happened to the global economy over the last 35 years. The forces of economic liberalization, globalization, and the rise of the multinational corporation have all left their mark. Many countries have benefited over this period, but some have suffered. Others have not really changed much in terms of their global economic position.
Using data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), we produced a dynamic Voronoi diagram showing the GDPs of the world's largest countries from 1980 to 2015. GDP is the total market value of all goods and services produced in a country for a given time period.
In the diagram, the size of the countries and regions represent the relative size of their economies (in terms of nominal GDP). As the diagram cycles through the years from 1980 to 2015, you can see how economies have grown or contracted relative to others.
We have produced similar diagrams before — one comparing the level of economic activity in the various US states, and another comparing the GDP (by sector) of the world's largest economies. Check them out for more economic insights!
Note: The area labeled "other" represents countries with a combined GDP that has been consistently lower than 11.5% of the global economy over the last 35 years.
What the diagram tells us
If you focus on a particular region or country, you will notice that in many cases there is a period of relative expansion followed by relative contraction, or vice versa. The US economy, for example, grew in relative terms until 1985, then it started to shrink until 1995, when it started growing again to a peak in 2002, and then fell back again until about 2009 — since then it has been relatively stable at around 22% of global GDP. (Talk about a rollercoaster ride!)
The biggest change over the last 35 years was a transfer of economic dominance from Europe to Asia. In fact, in 1980, Europe represented approximately 32% of global economic activity, while Asia accounted for about 20%. By 2012, their positions had been completely reversed.
Meanwhile, the relative GDP of North America decreased by just 2% over the 35-year period, while South America, Oceania, and Africa saw marginal increases. The Canadian and Mexican economies have declined slightly in relative terms (by 0.2% and 0.4%) between 1980 and 2014, while the US economy went from 25.7% of global GDP in 1980 to 22.5% in 2014.
The most drastic country-level changes happened within Asia. The biggest story is of course China, which grew from 2.8% of global GDP in 1980 to 13.4% in 2014. Conversely, Japan shrunk from 9.8% in 1980 to 6.0% in 2014. The other big contributors to Asia's economic growth were India, South Korea, Russia, and Taiwan.
According to IMF projections, 2015 will actually be a fantastic year of growth for the US, China, and India: the US economy is forecast to grow by 1.8% compared to 2014 (in relative terms), while China and India are forecast to grow by 1.6% and 0.5%. The worst-performing economies this year will be Russia (-0.8%), Brazil (-0.4%), Japan (-0.4%), Germany (-0.4%), and France (-0.4%).
Key findings
Here are the key points that this diagram has taught us:
History doesn't go in a straight line: for many countries (including the US), the last 35 years have been an economic rollercoaster ride. Another example is Japan, which reached a peak of 17.6% of the global economy in 1994, but now stands at just 6%.
The global economy actually moves in waves: over the years, recessions in the US have impacted the entire global economy. For instance, rising US interest rates from 1986-1989 and an oil price shock in 1990 briefly slowed economic growth in the US. Also, the year 2001 saw the dot-com bubble burst and 9-11 attacks, which ended a decade of economic growth. But it was the Great Recession from 2007-2009 that had the biggest impact, causing the US and European economies to slow while emerging countries (mostly in Asia) continued to gather steam.
While off its peak, the US remains the most dominant single economy, representing almost one-quarter (22.5%) of the world's GDP — equivalent to the Europe's share.
China's economy has skyrocketed, growing from a relatively small economy in 1980 (2.8% of global GDP) to the second-largest economy today (13.4% of global GDP).
In terms of GDP, Asia is the new Europe — Asia's current share of the global economy is roughly equivalent to Europe's in 1980 (32%).
Where is the global economy heading?
According to the IMF's World Economic Outlook, the global economy will grow by 3.3% in 2015, slightly slower than last year. But the IMF notes that advanced economies will actually be growing faster this year, while growth in developing economies will be slower than in 2014.
The IMF expects global growth to speed up to 3.8% in 2016 due to low interest rates, neutral fiscal policy in the EU, lower fuel prices, and growing confidence in labor market conditions. The Chair of the Federal Reserve in the US seems confident as well, recently stating that “the prospects for the US economy generally appear solid”. Nevertheless, there are downside economic risks, including market volatility and excessive asset prices shifts.

There are hundreds if not thousands of different tools made to visualize, analyze and track activity around the Bitcoin network. It can quickly get overwhelming to figure out what are good, reliable, sources of information and which aren't. It's also very easy to forget cool tools that you've found and used before if you never bookmarked them.
At LocalBitcoins we use several tools daily to help us reply to support requests and to just keep us informed with what is going on with the Bitcoin network. I've gathered together in this blogpost our current five most used tools.
The first thing to do when you wake up and the last thing to do when you go to bed is to check the price. Bitcoinity is the favorite for many at LocalBitcoins due to its simple design and the metrics it shows.
Quickly spot the trend over the last period, check the status of the orderbook and see how much the price has moved. Switch easily between different exchange-currency pairs and wonder why the price in CNY is higher again.
As a bonus it also displays a constantly updating price in the menu bar of your browser, making it easy to keep an eye on the price while writing that report.
Every Bitcoiner has their own favorite block explorer, at LocalBitcoins our current favorite is Tradeblock.com. We like it because it picks up newly sent transactions quickly, it doesn't forget unconfirmed transactions and it has a clear and simple user interface. You follow chains of transactions by clicking on inputs and outputs and get nice warnings when a transaction is built on unconfirmed inputs.
It's easy to find the fee level of each transaction as well as other statistics you care about such as the size and the transaction ID. We really dig how they grey out the last four digits of Bitcoin amounts.
Plus the live view of the network is one of the most funky we've seen, the lavalamp of 2016.
I admit, it's a little egoistic to add this one to the list but Charts.coin.dance shows the total Bitcoin volume for several peer to peer exchanges, LocalBitcoins included. It updates once a week on Monday and using our public market data API the site gets the most up-to-date data on trades done on our exchange.
Many in the Bitocin industry believe that our volume is a good indicator for overall Bitcoin adoption around the world and who are we to disagree? Either way, even if you disagree, it's hard to not be bullish when you see Bitcoin volumes grow.
Let's face it, the way Bitcoin wallets handle transaction fees is right now messy. Some wallets allow you to choose a priority, others allow you to choose a fee level and some just show the exact fee you're paying.
That doesn't help when Bitcoin is under a spam attack and your normal fee no longer works to get your transaction confirmed in the next block.
Enter bitcoinfees.21.co. The guys over at 21 inc have made a tool that allows you to judge what fee level you should be paying for your transaction to get it confirmed in time. Using this site you can finally convert that cryptic Satoshi per byte number into what you actually care about - how long it'll take for your transaction to confirm.
While bitcoinfees.21.com uses bar graphs, bitcoinqueue uses stacked line graphs to give you a visualization of all transactions waiting to be confirmed per fee level. Watch the queue of transactions grows and see which fee levels are the most popular.
Used together, Bitcoinqueue and Bitcoinfees.21.co, gives you a great overview on what is currently going on with Bitcoin transactions in the mempool.
MEPs welcome the newly-passed Ukrainian laws on a special status for the contested districts of Donetsk and Luhansk and the amnesty approved by the Ukrainian Parliament on 16 September as an "important contribution to de-escalation"
The EU pact with Ukraine will not be changed
The EU-Ukraine Association and free trade agreement, ratified simultaneously on Tuesday by the Ukrainian and European parliaments, "cannot and will not be changed", despite the pressure exerted by Russia, MEPs stress. They call on EU countries to proceed swiftly with their own national procedures for ratifying the agreement.
MEPs welcome the signing of ceasefire in Minsk and deplore its violation by Russian troops andseparatists. But they worry that this ceasefire could "just be a pretext for Russian troops to regroup in order to continue their offensive".
EU sanctions are just and must be stepped up
The European Parliament supports the latest EU sanctions against Russia and deplores Russian "counter-sanctions" as “unjustified”. It calls on the EU to consider excluding Russia from civil nuclear cooperation and the SWIFT international payment system.
MEPs salute France's decision to halt delivery of "Mistral" helicopter carriers to Russia and call on EU member states to follow its example with regard to exports not covered by the EU sanctions decisions such as arms and (civilian/military) “dual use” material.
MEPs call on the EU to regulate third-party businesses in the areas of gas storage, interconnectors and flow-back facilities, and urge the EU countries to cancel planned energy sector agreements with Russia, including the South Stream gas pipeline.
MEPs underline the importance of the "independent, rapid and full investigation", delegated to the Dutch Safety Board, into the causes of the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, and the need to bring those responsible for the crash to justice.
They nonetheless insist that there should be a political, not a military, solution, and stress the "reversibility and scalability" of the EU sanctions, should the situation in Ukraine improve. They also call on the EU to facilitate dialogue between Ukraine and Russia.
More money for EU farmers hit by Russia's trade ban
The budget for EU measures offsetting the impact on EU farmers of Russia's trade ban should be increased and their coverage extended to more products, say MEPs. They also call for promotional efforts to boost EU farm produce sales on alternative markets to avoid oversupply on the EU market. This money should come from EU funds other than agricultural ones, as the crisis was "first and foremost of a political nature",, say MEPs.
Call to release Estonian counter-intelligence officer
MEPs condemn the abduction of an Estonian counterintelligence officer from Estonian territory and call on Russia "to immediately release Mr Kohver and allow his safe to return to Estonia". They also deplore the abduction and brutal killing of the Honorary Consul of Lithuania Mykola Zelenc, in Luhansk.

VIDEO -
In almost every Arab country, threats, curses or swears are heard when Israel is mentioned. But in this sea of hostility there is now a new ray of light: Breastfeeding training videos in Arabic by Clalit Health Services, an Israeli health maintenance organization, are gain tremendous popularity in countries which have mostly been fighting Israel in the past few decades.
About six months ago, Clalit uploaded a series of YouTube training videos on a variety of topics: Breastfeeding, pregnancy monitoring, early detection of diseases, preparation for routine checkups and physical therapy. For the benefit of the Arab community who are members of Clalit Health Services, the videos were also posted in Arabic.
Months went by, and recently Clalit officials noticed that the number of video views is relatively very high compared to the number people in Israel. They then discovered an extremely surprising figure: Out of the 1.1 million views only 45,000 were from Israel, while the rest were from neighboring Arab countries, as well as from more distant ones.
Genetic Link Israelis find new way to fight breast cancer Daniel Koren New strategy developed by research team from Weizmann Institute of Science may be able to help descendants of women with triple-negative cancer Israelis find new way to fight breast cancer
The highest number of viewership so far was recorded in Saudi Arabia: 560,166. Egypt is second with 168,900 views, followed by Iraq with 89,999 entries, Morocco with 71,213, Algeria with 65,505 and Jordan with 42,000 entries.
Even bleeding Syria took interest in the videos: 11,000 entries were reported so far from the civil-war-struck country.
Almost all entries were to videos dealing with breastfeeding. And the Arab community does not simply watch the videos, but also engages in them: Clalit reports that many users from Arab countries comment on the videos and even provide encouragement.
"Thank you for the useful advice," wrote surfer Fatima, with many others writing supportive comments to a similar effect.
Clalit officials are quite surprised and pleased by this phenomenon. "We never imagined there would be so much viewership beyond our borders," says Lior Wolff, who heads the development of e-health services for Clalit.
"It is far beyond the viewership statistics of the target audience in Israel. We believe in promoting the health of the community anywhere, without borders or boundaries, and so we are pleased to contribute to the health of Arab countries. Perhaps through breastfeeding we can help construct a dialogue based on compassion, concern and love."
Update (7/24): Microsoft has clarified their stance on the apparently secretly-loved-by-the-masses Paint app. Yes, Paint will be eventually removed from the core group of bundled Windows applications, but "MS Paint" as Microsoft is calling it will simply move to the Windows Store as a free download.
Furthermore, the newer Paint 3D will continue to be bundled and actively updated. Paint 3D was added with the Windows 10 Creators Update, and it's a modern take of the Paint app, with better support for stylus hardware and 3D capabilities, in addition to standard/basic photo editing tools.
This is what Microsoft posted in the Windows blog hours after the Paint story was widely reported online:
Today, we've seen an incredible outpouring of support and nostalgia around MS Paint. If there's anything we learned, it's that after 32 years, MS Paint has a lot of fans. It's been amazing to see so much love for our trusty old app. Amidst today's commentary around MS Paint we wanted to take this opportunity to set the record straight, clear up some confusion and share some good news: MS Paint is here to stay, it will just have a new home soon, in the Windows Store where it will be available for free.
After being around for 32 years and becoming one of the most recognized elements of the Windows operating system, Microsoft is planning to kill off graphics app Paint. The Redmond firm has threatened to depreciate the long-running program in the next Windows 10 update.
In a list of “Features that are removed or depreciated in Windows 10 Fall Creators Update,” Paint is one of the items classed as “not in active development and might be removed in future releases."
Paint started out as a 1-bit monochrome licensed version of ZSoft's PC Paintbrush in the first version of Windows 1.0 in 1985. Having been around for over three decades, and with the introduction of Paint 3D in April's Windows 10 Creators Update, it seems as if the program will soon become nothing more than part of Windows' history.
While it was far from the best graphics app and pales in comparison to professional programs, it's still used by millions for a bit of quick and easy editing.
System Image Backup (SIB) solution is also being depreciated. Microsoft is pointing users to “full-disk backup solutions from other vendors” as an alternative.
Windows features that are definitely being removed include Outlook Express, Reader App and Reader list (both being integrated into Edge), and encryption utility Syskey, which Microsoft says is insecure - it recommends people use BitLocker instead.
No official word yet on when Paint might be removed from Windows. We still don't know the exact date when the Fall Creators Update will arrive, either, though it's expected to roll out sometime this October.
Up until this week, the most notable video game exhibit at an American museum was probably the Smithsonian Institute's "Art of Video Games," due largely to the Smithsonian's reputation. However, that 2012 production, which eventually traveled to multiple museums, had a surprising lack of playable stuff, along with a largely pedestrian look at gaming's history as categorized by console generations, as opposed to technological or artistic strides.
Seattle's Experience Music Project was one of the Smithsonian exhibit's hosts and from the look of things, its staff had a similar inkling about how games exhibits could be done better. On Friday, EMP debuted its own wildly different take on such an exhibit, and it's a stunner. Titled Indie Game Revolution, the two-year venture has chosen to spread gaming's artistic gospel not by recalling its history but by celebrating its weirdest small-team creations.
"For me, I really love the idea that we could maximize the number of experiences people could play, but also that these games are either unreleased or released within the last year," EMP senior curator Jacob McMurray said to Ars. "We're focusing on what's happening now, rather than hitting the highlights of yesteryear, even within the indie realm."
McMurray's work at the EMP has mostly been about music, including putting together impressive Jimi Hendrix and Nirvana exhibits in recent years and he admitted to being an indie gaming novice before taking this project on.
"I'd always played a lot of games, but definitely not in the indie realm," he said.
Hence, his video-taped interviews with 45 game makers, music composers, and others can be found all over the exhibit, and they're nearly as omnipresent as the playable games themselves. That's no accident.
"I had an idea for a narrative pretty early on, but everybody we interviewed served to course-correct what our narrative was," McMurray said. "It made me realize that those human stories needed to be huge. It couldn't just be games. It had to be the human stories of why people create these games. That ended up being a big surprise, and one of the most important parts of the exhibit."
The current selection of 20 games ranges from indie heavy hitters like Gone Home and Broken Age to games we'd never even heard of and McMurray promises a dozen new games being rotated into Indie Game Revolution every two months. Check out the current selection, and the exhibit's wild, live-pixel aesthetic in our gallery below. (All photos by the author.)
Listing of professional wrestling champions for the Women's Championship
This article is about a list of wrestlers who have held the original now-retired Women's Championship . For the other championships, see WWE Women's Championship
Layla was the final WWE Women's Champion
The WWE Women's Championship was a women's professional wrestling championship in the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) promotion.[1] The championship was generally contested in professional wrestling matches, in which participants execute scripted finishes rather than contend in direct competition. There have been a total of 30 recognized champions who have had a combined 59 official reigns. The title became vacant only twice in history for a total of 65 days and deactivated twice for a combined 1398 days. The following is a chronological list of wrestlers that have been WWE Women's Champion by ring name.
As recognized by the WWE, the inaugural champion was The Fabulous Moolah, who won the title on September 18, 1956, which at that time was the NWA World Women's Championship (which still exists today). While she was still champion, it became the WWF Women's Championship in 1984. In May 2002, after the WWF was renamed to WWE, the championship became the WWE Women's Championship. At the start of the brand extension that began in March 2002, the Women's Championship was defended on any brand until it became exclusive to Raw in September that year. It was the only women's championship in the WWE until SmackDown created the WWE Divas Championship as a counterpart title in July 2008. The titles switched brands in April 2009. On September 19, 2010, at Night of Champions, the Women's Championship was unified with the WWE Divas Championship, retiring the Women's Championship.
The Fabulous Moolah's first reign is the longest reign, and is officially recognized to be 10,170 days, due to WWE not recognizing title changes between 1956 and 1984 (her first reign's real number is 3,651 days, which is still the longest reign). Moolah technically also has the most reigns at 8, but since the WWE does not recognize the title changes between 1956 and 1984, Moolah only has 4 reigns and Trish Stratus has the most reigns with 7. Mickie James has the shortest reign with 1 hour. Wendi Richter is the youngest champion at the age of 22 years and 10 months, and Moolah is the oldest at the age of 76 years and 106 days. Bertha Faye is the heaviest champion and The Kat is the lightest champion. Chyna is the only undefeated champion. The final champion was Layla, in her first and only reign.

Oh, Ringo Starr. I always knew your were my favorite Beatle. Actually, he's my fourth favorite Beatle and I'm more of a LED Zepplin/The Who guy, but none of that is important right now.
What is important is that Ringo supports Brexit. Remember Brexit (see Michael Caine Defends Brexit: ‘I'd Rather Be a Poor Master, Than a Rich Servant' and Tommy Robinson Asks Anti-Brexit Protesters About the EU. They Embarrass Themselves)? People in favor of staying in the European Union were all “we get by with a little help from our friends” where people opposed were all “you've got to pay your dues when the EU gives us the blues, and leaving don't come easy.”
(Ok, that joke was rough, but I apologize for nothing).
RINGO: The people voted, and they have to get on with it. “Oh, well we don't like that vote.” What do you mean you don't like that vote? You had the vote, this is what won. Let's get on with it. BBC: Would you have voted for Brexit? RINGO: I would have. I think it's a great move. I think to be in control of your country is a good move.
Que whiny leftists, “but he's old and he lives in America!!!!!”
Right. America is a country that exists because it didn't want to be dictated to by another country. America: the original Brexit. America: because screw those guys across the pond. America: we'll take care of our own interests better than you tea-swilling tossers. America: because unelected globalist dunces can go screw themselves. America: because British food tastes like ass.
Now replace “America” with “United Kingdom.” Here, I'll help. UK: because the EU is filled with globalist gangsters who couldn't hold a real job to save their own paper weights. UK: because our culture is worth saving from liberal savages who hate greatness. UK: because national sovereignty is more than big bold letters of our country's name on a map. UK: because we're tired of listening to control freak dinguses telling us what to do with our own nation, go fornicate with yourselves.

Another day, another stupid copyright claim silences a lawful use online. Copyright abuse is all too common, but some forms deserve special attention and a place in EFF Takedown Hall of Shame.
First up: a particularly offensive use of the DMCA to force offline a series of videos debunking AIDS denialists. It seems there's a community of people trying to convince the world that the medical science behind, and treatment for, HIV/AIDS is all wrong. What is worse, they are trying to convince HIV positive people not to take life-saving medications. One of their principal propaganda tools is the movie “House of Numbers” in which a young Canadian named Brent Leung purports to investigate the science behind AIDS. Video blogger Myles Power (not his real name) created a series of videos of his own, debunking the “facts” and testimony discussed in House of Numbers. Movie backers Knowledge Matters LLC and Martin Penny promptly filed several DMCA notices targeting the videos, because Powers included clips from the movie in order to critique it. Powers could, of course, counter-notice, but understandably hesitated to do so, fearful of retaliation. With EFF's help, Power has now challenged the takedowns—but they should never have happened in the first place.
The AIDS denialist's tactics echo those of our second inductee, former Navy chaplain and Colorado Assembly candidate Gordon Klingenschmitt. Just before Christmas, Klingenschmitt launched a campaign to use the DMCA to shut down the YouTube account of People for the American Way's Right Wing Watch (“RWW”) project. RWW reports and comments on the political views of folks like Klingenschmitt, using their own words. Klingenschmitt sent a series of takedown notices claiming that RWW's use of clips of his program infringed his copyrights—never mind that RWW was obviously posting them as part of its critical work. Because YouTube has a policy of shutting down accounts after three takedown notices, Klingenschmitt's bogus complaints caused RWW's entire account to be taken offline—twice. The harassment finally stopped only when PFAW, also with EFF's help, threatened to take Klingenschmitt to court.
As we have noted before, the “three strikes and you're out” approach to DMCA notices taken by YouTube and other service providers is ripe for this kind of abuse. YouTube has made some improvements, but there's much more service providers could do.
In the meantime, there's a lot of talk these days about copyright reform. Know what really needs fixing? The legal and technological practices that are blurring the line between copyright and censorship.
Update: Myles Powers' videos are back up ahead of the usual counternotice two-week timeline, thanks to intervention from YouTube. Well done YouTube, it's great to see you intervene to protect fair use!

Honestly releasing it with units not fully finished might be a better idea. Minus the hellbat every unit I listed should never have made it into the game in their current form and are a complete joke from a game design point of view not a balance whine point of view, actually both.

Before removing (Warhound) and changing other units they at least had their units they intended to include already finished. We have still missing units and there is lotsa stuff to be decided in terms of game design. Beta is at least 2 or 3 months away, if not more.

I think it's the Disruptor, because it kind of looks like a fruit/slot machine with the way in which it turns like the rollers on the aforementioned machines.
The only difference is when you get all bars you end up killing lots and lots of bios instead of cash :S

Hundreds of thousands of teenagers will have to take key exams earlier than usual this year to help Muslim pupils fasting for Ramadan.
The GCSE and A-level schedule has been rearranged so that some exams in key subjects are clustered before the start of the Islamic holy month.
Where maths and English tests do fall during the festival, a larger number than usual are being held in the morning.
Changes: The GCSE and A-level schedule has been rearranged so that some exams in key subjects are clustered before the start of the Islamic holy month (file picture)
This is to avoid disadvantaging fasting pupils who can suffer low energy levels in the afternoon.
The Joint Council for Qualifications, which represents exam boards, said timetable allowances would be made where possible in subjects with large numbers of entries.
Several core maths exams appear to have been shifted to earlier dates than last year, meaning candidates will have fewer days to revise.
Similar measures are likely to be in place for at least five years, until Ramadan no longer clashes with the exam season.
The holy month, which runs from June 6 to July 5 this summer, moves backward through the calendar by around 11 days a year.
Q&A ON THE EXAMS SHAKE-UP What is happening to this summer's exams and why? Exam boards have scheduled some GCSEs and A-level examinations taken by most pupils – like English and maths – before the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. This year, the festival falls between June 6 and July 5, which overlaps with a significant proportion of exams. Muslims observe fasting during daylight hours and there are concerns it will have a detrimental impact on their results. Officials will also aim to timetable exams with ‘consideration' – meaning earlier in the day – so Muslim pupils can concentrate better after their pre-dawn meal. What will it mean for pupils? Hundreds of thousands of pupils will take some exams up to a week earlier than in previous years – meaning they have less time to revise. However, many subjects will be unaffected because they are less popular, while others were already scheduled before the start of Ramadan. There will also be an increase in the number of important exams being held in the morning. Such measures are likely to be adopted by boards for at least the next five years, while the month of Ramadan continues to clash with exam season. How have the different exam boards responded? AQA appears to have shifted several key maths exams to earlier dates this year by comparison with last year's timetable, and those remaining during Ramadan will be scheduled in the morning. English examinations are unaffected as they were held early last year also. OCR is holding all of its English and maths exams in the morning, and these exams appear to be clustered toward the beginning of the exam season. Why is Ramadan an issue now? Ramadan moves earlier by around 11 days in the calendar every year, and only comes full circle about every 33 years. Last year there was a smaller overlap between Ramadan and the exam season. The last time this situation arose was in the early 1980s when Muslims made up only an estimated 1 per cent of the population compared with almost 5 per cent now. Why have I not heard about this change before? Similar arrangements were announced for last year's exams, but there was less of an overlap so it did not make much difference. The issue was raised again in a Commons education committee session yesterday morning, when children's commissioner Anne Longfield was questioned by MPs. Tory MP Suella Fernandes asked how Muslim pupils could be accommodated over Ramadan. The children's commissioner said discussions were being held around revised arrangements. JCQ later said there would not be a ‘delay' but confirmed that some exams would be reshuffled.
Muslims avoid food during daylight hours, eating before dawn and after dusk instead.
The exam boards said that the timetable would not see drastic changes but yesterday campaigners questioned whether special allowances should be made.
‘They should let things be,' insisted Colin Hart, of the pressure group Christian Concern. ‘How can you start changing the rules for everybody just to accommodate those particular pupils who are Muslims, who are in a minority?
‘We don't live in Saudi Arabia where they need to fit the exams around sharia principles. It's wrong imposing this festival on everybody else.'
Keith Porteous Wood, of the National Secular Society, said: ‘If there are a significant number of Muslim students that are affected and calling for a change, they should be accommodated, but only if this can be achieved with no or minimal disruption.'
According to the latest census, 2.71million Muslims live in England and Wales – making up 4.8 per cent of the population.
Sir Iqbal Sacranie, founding secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: ‘The decision is fair and just. But this is not a special privilege and it is within the JCQ policy, which is welcomed and appreciated.
‘People often accuse Muslims of demanding special rights and provisions. We don't want them.
‘This is of particular relevance when it comes to accommodating faith communities for their religious festivals, particularly Muslim and Jewish communities, who follow the lunar calendar.
‘Religious communities need to be able to celebrate their festivities without being burdened by examinations on these special days.'
Similar plans to accommodate Muslim students were announced for last year's exams, but the effect was minimal because Ramadan began on June 18. The exam season runs from late May through to the end of June.
The plans for this summer have been in place for up to 12 months, but emerged only during a Commons education committee session yesterday.
In a statement, the JCQ said it consulted on the timetable every year and considered comments from a wide range of groups, including schools, colleges and faith groups.
A JCQ spokesman added: ‘The small window in which examinations can be taken, the large number of candidates taking examinations and the diverse range of subjects available to candidates, places significant limitations on the changes that can be accommodated for any one group.
‘However, JCQ meets the needs of various groups as far as possible. JCQ and the qualifications regulator Ofqual have previously met with Muslim groups to discuss the timetabling of examinations in light of Ramadan moving into the examination period.
‘Where possible, large entry GCSE and GCE subjects are timetabled prior to the commencement of Ramadan and consideration given to whether they are timetabled in the morning or afternoon.'
Malcolm Trobe, deputy general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the union was meeting with Muslim faith leaders to discuss Ramadan, and plans to issue guidance to schools and colleges ahead of the exams.
He said: ‘The guidance will be non-prescriptive and will not advise families or students on how they should address the question of fasting.
New ideas: The Joint Council for Qualifications, which represents exam boards, said timetable allowances would be made where possible in subjects with large numbers of entries (file picture)
'School and college leaders are very keen to work with communities to ensure young people are able to observe Ramadan without any detrimental impact on their examinations.'
How can you start changing the rules for everybody just to accommodate those particular pupils who are Muslims, who are in a minority? Colin Hart, Christian Concern
JCQ's statement was issued after children's commissioner Anne Longfield was asked by the education committee about the impact of Ramadan falling over the exams period.
In response, she said she was not aware of the detail but that she understood there were discussions under way around changing the timetable.
Teachers first raised concerns about the impact of Ramadan on Muslim teenagers two years ago, arguing that if students go into their exams hungry or thirsty it could affect their results.
Iceland voted to legalise blasphemy yesterday after a bill was brought to parliament by the country's Pirate Party.
Previously under Icelandic law anyone found to be “ridiculing or insulting the dogmas or worship of a lawfully existing religious community,” could be punished with three months in prison or a fine.
However, following the murder of 11 people in Paris after the controversial satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo published cartoons of the Prophet Mohamad, the Pirate Party introduced a measure to repeal the 1940 law in January.

Speaking in the Althing, Iceland's parliament, yesterday each member of the small party took the floor – as voting took place – to declare: “I am Charlie Hebdo.”
“The Icelandic Parliament has issued the important message that freedom will not bow to bloody attacks,” the party said in a statement released to The Iceland Monitor after the successful vote.
The measure was broadly supported by most political, religious and public figures – despite the ambivalent relationship much of Iceland's establishment has with the Pirate Party.
The party, led by Helgi Hrafn Gunnarsson, is the smallest in the 63-member Althing but has consistently polled above other, larger political organisations.
Their unconventional attitude is best typified by Mr Gunnarsson's performance in a recent parliamentary session.
He first compared the government's working to “the final scene of a ‘Game of Thrones' episode — the only thing you know for sure that there's probably something perfectly horrible about to happen,” before rapping an Icelandic rock song. The song in question concludes: “I've had enough of this mess; let's take it to the next level.”

Most of the political world spent Wednesday nursing hangovers from a long night of watching election returns and a long year of following the campaign. But in Washington, House Speaker John Boehner was pushing ahead with business. In a speech congratulating President Obama on his reelection, Boehner issued the standard call for bipartisanship and cooperation. But he also dropped a hint about his position on the next big item on the political agenda.
I'm talking about the budget reckoning that is scheduled to take place on January 1. Two things happen on that day. The Bush tax cuts, all of them, expire. And a series of automatic spending cuts, the so-called sequester, will take effect. Together, these changes would likely slow the economy. And while many experts believe the negative effect of this “fiscal cliff” be gradual—in other words, more a slope than a cliff—leaders of both parties say they would prefer to find an alternative method of reducing the deficit.
The hang-up has been a series of disputes over what that alternative should look like—chief among them, whether it should include new revenues. Republicans have generally opposed that idea. During the GOP primaries, Mitt Romney and the other candidates memorably said they would reject a budget deal that included even one dollar of revenue for every ten dollars in spending cuts. But Boehner on Wednesday suggested that maybe wasn't the party line after all: “We're willing to accept new revenue under the right conditions,” he said.
Of course, it's not clear how much ground Boehner really conceded. His statement was ambiguous, just like the signals he sent during the 2010 negotiations over whether and how to raise the nation's debt ceiling. He could simply have been describing a tax plan that, according to discredited supply-side economic theories, would generate new revenue from additional economic growth. Says one senior Democratic aide in the Senate:

Whose 4-0 start has been more impressive? When it comes to the Broncos and Seahawks, our voters (John Clayton, Ashley Fox, Dan Graziano, Jamison Hensley, Mike Sando and Kevin Seifert) choose the former.
Buoyed by four first-place votes, Peyton Manning & Co. have gained the No. 1 spot for the first time this season. Seattle falls to No. 2, ahead of the unbeaten Saints, Patriots and Chiefs.
Even though the Seahawks beat a 2012 playoff team (Houston) on the road in Week 4, the Broncos' season-long dominance is ringing more loudly. After a 52-20 pasting of Philadelphia, Denver is now averaging an amazing 44.8 points per game with a 22-point average margin of victory.
Does that mean the Broncos' reign is built to last? Most of the signs say yes, but the schedule will soon get tougher. Seattle likely isn't going anywhere, either. Right now, though, it just doesn't have the style points to stay on top.

Employee handbook, policy and procedure manuals, employee manuals, culture book. It doesn't matter how you call them, that employee handbooks are often considered a necessary evil by both employees and employers.
They typically generate consternation from employees, especially if they are not clear, well-written, and specific to the business and if they focus mostly on negativity and on what not to do. Employers, meanwhile, typically look at these manuals in terms of how to cover their…assets…in the event of any potential lawsuits.
There is, however, a better way.
You may have no choice but to include specific policies and procedures required by federal, state, or local laws. Still, it doesn't have to read like something that was spit out of an online employee handbook generator. One way to address these competing needs is to create a “culture book” for the more human aspects, and a separate legal document for the more formal HR policies and procedures.
However you decide to approach your employee handbook, the following examples may help reshape the way you think about them.

Ok, so this is the first time I've ever done anything like this before. I love the free form and unfinished look of it. I also have newly developed callouses on my pointer finger and thumb from this project. ^_^ I'm also new to embroidery and my skills in it increased with each patch I did. This was such a fun learning and playing project and it makes me hungry for more!
So all of it is done by hand, except for the liner and the sewing on of the handles (I wanted those suckers to stay on there!). I did sew the liner into the bag by hand, though. I had numerous ideas for the handles, but nothing panned out, so I went simple and just bought the straps at the fabric store.
And so upclose shots of the panels on this side:
For the houses I wanted to think outside of the box and to represent them I just used their colors on the patch and went crazy. The yellow and black is Hufflepuff and next to is the Platform 9 3/4 sign done on felt with a flannel background.
Ron's christmas sweater from his mom, Mrs. Weasley. The sweater is felt and the background is flannel. The glasses and lightbolt was freezer paper stenciled on and then I stitched around the edges.
Harry Potter's wand. The wand I free hand painted on and stitched around. The lettering is stamped on with letter stamps and fabric paint.
And Griffindor's patch. This is my very first patch. ^_^
Ravenclaw patch. I just stitch the pattern on the fabric with the embroidery floss. The Weasley patch has beaded above the crown. They are clear iridescent so they are hard to see in the picture.
Hedwig is a freezer paper stencil and then I stitched on the detailing. The sorting hat is felt.
This is Voldemort's wand, done with a freezer paper stencil. I stitch around it and stitched on the wording. It's hard to read in the picture, but it says "13 1/2 inches, Yew, Phoenix Feather Core".
The Deathly Hallows symbol. I used freezer paper to make the outline of the lines that I stitched over. A winged key that I free hand painted and stitched around. The key is a metal scrapbooking one, and it has beads around it.
A quote from Dumbledore. "It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live."
For the sides I decided I wanted to do just a long panel. Here is a quote that is exclusively in the books. Kinda sad that Peeves was never featured in the movies, but this is something is says at the end of the last book. It says "We did it, we bashed him, wee potter's the one, and voldy's gone moldy, so lets have FUN!"
On this one I printed off the Harry Potter logo and made a stencil out of freezer paper and dabbed in the white. I used black embroidery floss to stitch around the edges of the lettering (that took forever! lol!)
The bottom is pretty unremarkable. Just random stitches. But its the bottom, so it won't be seen as much. ^_^
And for a size reference and to show the fabric inside:
Thanks for looking! I FINALLY finished! YAY! First off I have to give a shout out to sheepBlue who inspired me to make this bag. She made a Harry Potter themed teesha moore bag and I fell in love with it right off and knew I needed to make one for SIL for her birthday. She and I are huge Harry Potter fans. Well, it didn't make it on time for her birthday, but I'm not too far off. ^_^Ok, so this is the first time I've ever done anything like this before. I love the free form and unfinished look of it.

The wand I free hand painted on and stitched around. The lettering is stamped on with letter stamps and fabric paint.And Griffindor's patch. This is my very first patch. ^_^Ravenclaw patch. I just stitch the pattern on the fabric with the embroidery floss. The Weasley patch has beaded above the crown. They are clear iridescent so they are hard to see in the picture.Hedwig is a freezer paper stencil and then I stitched on the detailing. The sorting hat is felt.This is Voldemort's wand, done with a freezer paper stencil. I stitch around it and stitched on the wording. It's hard to read in the picture, but it says "13 1/2 inches, Yew, Phoenix Feather Core".The Deathly Hallows symbol. I used freezer paper to make the outline of the lines that I stitched over. A winged key that I free hand painted and stitched around. The key is a metal scrapbooking one, and it has beads around it.A quote from Dumbledore. "It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live."For the sides I decided I wanted to do just a long panel. Here is a quote that is exclusively in the books. Kinda sad that Peeves was never featured in the movies, but this is something is says at the end of the last book. It says "We did it, we bashed him, wee potter's the one, and voldy's gone moldy, so lets have FUN!"On this one I printed off the Harry Potter logo and made a stencil out of freezer paper and dabbed in the white. I used black embroidery floss to stitch around the edges of the lettering (that took forever! lol!)The bottom is pretty unremarkable. Just random stitches. But its the bottom, so it won't be seen as much. ^_^And for a size reference and to show the fabric inside:Thanks for looking! « Last Edit: May 11, 2018 12:03:57 PM by kittykill » THIS ROCKS Logged Pinterest

Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 21 was a scheduled domestic flight from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, to Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada, via Prince George, Fort St. John, Fort Nelson and Watson Lake on July 8, 1965. The Douglas DC-6B plane crashed near 100 Mile House, British Columbia, taking the lives of all 52 aboard.[1][2] An inquest determined that the explosion was the result of a bomb, but as of 2019 the crime remains unsolved.[1]
Incident [ edit ]
While en route from Vancouver to Prince George the DC-6 Empress of City of Buenos Aires, piloted by World War II veteran John 'Jack' Steele,[3] crashed after passing Ashcroft, British Columbia. About 15:40, three mayday calls were heard by air traffic control in Vancouver. An explosion had occurred in the left aft lavatory. The tail separated from the fuselage. The aircraft spiralled and crashed into a wooded area. All 46 passengers and 6 crew perished.[2] The crash site is 40 km (25 mi) west of 100 Mile House.[1] Remnants of the DC-6 remain at the crash site near Dog Creek.[4]
Aftermath [ edit ]
A coroner's inquest concluded "an explosive substance foreign to the normal contents of the aircraft" caused the crash. A witness on the ground saw the tail of the aircraft separate from the fuselage and debris trail out behind the aircraft. The debris turned out to be the bodies of passengers forced out by the depressurization of the aircraft. The fuselage was consumed by fire where it fell but the tail, found 500 metres away, was not. Rescue crews reached the crash site while the fire continued to burn but no survivors were found. Crash investigators found traces of acid that led them to believe a bomb in the lavatory was involved. Traces of potassium nitrate and carbon, consistent with a "low-velocity explosion" were found. Gunpowder or stumping powder causes a low-velocity explosion. The explosion damaged bulkheads in the lavatory, severed pipes in the tail and tore a metre-wide hole in the side of the fuselage. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigation focused on four passengers although none was a suspect. No one claimed responsibility and no charges were ever laid. The source of the explosion remains unknown.[1]
2018 investigation [ edit ]
The crash was re-examined by experts during six episodes of the second season of the CBC true crime podcast Uncover.[5]

"75. The Type 45 destroyer is the most modern ship in the British Fleet and a key part of its innovative design was its propulsion system. However, shortly after its introduction into service, the propulsion system developed serious problems. Between the launch of the first of class (HMS Daring) in February 2006 and the final Type 45 launch (HMS Duncan) in October 2010, approximately 50 design changes were necessary. Despite that remedial work the Type 45s continue to suffer from reliability issues including major power failures. There have been improvements and the current failure rates are now one-third of those experienced in 2010. However, as Sir Mark Stanhope noted, there remains a "risk inherent" in using the Type 45."
"84. A second issue with the engine was a loss of reliability when the Type 45s operated in areas with high ambient air and sea temperature. When we questioned Tomas Leahy, Rolls-Royce, on how this came to be, he told us that the engine "met the specification for the Type 45 class [set by the MoD] and that the system met that specification". However, he added:
"Are the conditions experienced in the Gulf in line with that specification? No, they are not. The equipment is having to operate in far more arduous conditions than were initially required by that specification."
Given that the Royal Navy has undertaken significant operations in the Gulf for decades, this appears to be a startling error.
85. John Hudson, BAES, said that industry had highlighted to the MoD that there would be an upper limit for environmental temperatures and they had sought to produce a design that would have "graceful (sic) degradation beyond those temperatures". In other words, the engine would have the ability to carry on and operate, albeit sub-optimally, which would result in "a bit of drop-off" in terms of top speed. However, that was not the outcome. Admiral Jones acknowledged that a key failing in the specification was that the WR-21 was unable to operate effectively in hot temperatures and that, instead of a "graceful degradation", the engines were "degrading catastrophically".
86. It is astonishing that the specification for the Type 45 did not include the requirement for the ships to operate at full capacity—and for sustained periods—in hot regions such as the Gulf. The UK's enduring presence in the Gulf should have made it a key requirement for the engines. The fact that it was not was an inexcusable failing and one which must not be repeated in the Type 26 and GPFF programmes. Failure to guarantee this would put the personnel and ships of the Royal Navy in danger, with potentially dangerous consequences."
Needless to say the Western media,which has been awash with stories about the Admiral Kuznetsov's engine problems, has given minimal coverage to this incident.
After weeks of stories of the Admiral Kuznetsov's engine problems, it is the engines of one of Britain's top of the line Type 45 destroyers which have broken down, causing the ship to be towed back to port.As Russia's fleet has deployed to the eastern Mediterranean the well-known engine problems of its aircraft carrier the Admiral Kuznetsov have received an inordinate amount of attention.I have previously discussed the reasons for these problems . Briefly, the Admiral Kuznetsov when it was built in the 1980s was not only by an order of magnitude the biggest warship the Soviet/Russian navy had ever commissioned, but at 60,000 tons it was more than twice as heavy as the USSR's/Russia's next largest warships - the missile battlecruisers of the Kirov class - which use a combination of nuclear reactors and gas turbines.The Russians had not previously had to develop engines - whether nuclear or conventional - for warship as large and heavy ship, andThe follow-on ship to Kuznetsov and her intended sister Varyag was to be the planned aircraft carrier Ulyanovsk (which was never finished), which would have had a more suitable engine mix of four nuclear reactors. Note however that this would still have been twice as many nuclear reactors as the two much more powerful Westinghouse nuclear reactors used by the much bigger and heavier US Nimitz class carriers - a further sign of the USSR's/Russia's lack of fully suitable and sufficiently powerful engines, whether nuclear or conventional, for warships of this size.As I have also previously said, the Russians are aware of the problems with the Kuznetsov's engines,As it is, the Kuznetsov is due to undertake a comprehensive refit after 2018 during which the present unreliable engines are due to be replaced.The over-emphasis on the problems of the Kuznetsov's engines - which are not affecting the carrier's conduct of its current mission in Syria - has howeveras I was reminded when I was reading the British House of Commons' Defence Committee report on the state of Britain's Royal Navy , which was published four days ago.The most advanced warships of the Royal Navy are its Type 45 Daring class destroyers , described by some as the most advanced naval destroyers in the world. Since 2009 when the first entered service with the Royal Navy they have been plagued by engine reliability problems. Here is house the Defence Committee report describes themHowever perhaps the most extraordinary revelation is that the engines do not work properly in warm waters such as those of the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf. Here is what the Defence Committee report has to say about thatIn light of all this it comes as no surprise that there are now reports that instead of the Admiral Kuznetsov having to be towed into combat by its accompanying tug,
Ukrainian Intelligence: Separatists are Training for New Offensive Tuesday, February 2, 2016 1:06:00 PM
Separatists in the Donetsk region are training for offensive ground actions in the area of Torez in eastern Ukraine. This was reported on Monday by the Chief of the Ukrainian Intelligence Agency.
“At the same time as showing a readiness to comply with the provisions of the Minsk Agreements, the Command of the Russian Forces has intensified measures to increase the combat capability of formations of the 1st and 2nd Territorial Army of the South Command,” the report stated.
“The offensive and counter-attack activities of the combat training show that the enemy has not abandoned plans for expansion of the controlled territories. They use the so-called truce to prepare for the resumption of armed conflict. In the area of Torez in particular, they are preparing large-scale offensive training of the 1 AK units. They currently have 40 tanks, 70 armored fighting vehicles and six 122mm MLRS Grad,” the message continued.
The Intelligence has noted that the direct control over the training activities is carried out by the Commission of the Center of the Territorial Troops of the Southern Military District of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.
It was also noted that representatives of the Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe have been provided with information relating to the presence of weapons in the areas of Donetsk, Makiivka and Zaitseve. These weapons include tanks and mortars of 120mm caliber, which are strictly prohibited under the Minsk Agreements.

WALTHAM, MA — This year Veterans Day, a national holiday established in 1926 to honor men and women who have served in the military, falls on a Saturday the school holiday is Friday, but the Waltham remembrance ceremony will be Saturday.
According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Day marks an armistice, or a temporary cessation of hostilities, between Allied nations and Germany during the first world ward. In November of the following year, President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed Nov. 11 as the first commemoration of Armistice Day.
However, Armistice Day was originally set aside to honor veterans of World War 1, but following World War 2 in 1954, Congress amended the act of 1938 by striking out the word Armistice and replacing it with the word Veterans. President Dwight D. Eisenhower later issued a Veterans Day Proclamation which stated:
"In order to insure proper and widespread observance of this anniversary, all veterans, all veterans' organizations, and the entire citizenry will wish to join hands in the common purpose. Toward this end, I am designating the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs as Chairman of a Veterans Day National Committee, which shall include such other persons as the Chairman may select, and which will coordinate at the national level necessary planning for the observance. I am also requesting the heads of all departments and agencies of the Executive branch of the Government to assist the National Committee in every way possible."
Veterans' Day Saturday, November 11, at 11 a.m.
The City of Waltham Veterans' Services and The Waltham Allied Veterans' Council will honor all Veterans at a ceremony to be held at the Circle of Remembrance at 11 a.m. on the Common at 610 Main Street.
The Circle of Remembrance 13th annual Brick Dedication ceremony will follow the Veterans' Day Ceremony.
There will be seats provided for the 13th Brick Dedication and Veterans. Rain or shine.
If you're part of a veteran group, and plan to march in formation meet at the Elm Street Parking Lot behind City Hall at 10:30 a.m. and those will march in formation to the Circle of Remembrance.

SEATTLE -- Keelin Winters cracked under the strain of it all.
From the time she was a little girl, her life was directed toward a singular purpose: a spot on the U.S. women's national team. Her adolescence was spent on soccer fields. She attended summer school throughout college at the University of Portland in order to graduate a semester early with a jump on her peers.
Winters smiles thinking about her younger self during her rookie season with the Boston Breakers of the now-defunct WPS. She was a professional athlete, living in a new city and free of the burdens of adulthood.
Before I had the contract, I felt like I had nothing to lose. I was just going for it, and I was playing pretty well. As soon as I got that contract, I had something to lose. - Keelin Winters
“I loved it,” Winters said. “I had no worries. And then the season ended, and it was, ‘Now what? How am I going to make money?' That's when life really kicked in.”
Her long-sought shot with the national team came just in time. In 2012, just months after the WPS folded and following a standout performance at camp, Winters earned a contract with U.S. Soccer.
“With that contract, suddenly I had stability,” Winters said. “Suddenly, I knew I had a paycheck every month for as long as I was good enough to maintain my contract. So, talk about pressure. … And if I'm being completely honest, some of that pressure absolutely got to me. I had a hard time dealing with that.”
The intensity of U.S. women's national team camps is legendary. Most national teamers have given up trying to explain it, shaking their heads with dark humor that suggests that, if you haven't experienced the gauntlet for yourself, you'll never fully understand.
As incendiary as anything else is the issue of pay.
For players on the fringe of the national team, they're competing for more than just a roster spot -- they're fighting for their livelihoods. U.S. Soccer salaries allow for a relatively comfortable living, with the new CBA paying players six-digit salaries between their national team and National Women's Soccer League salaries. Many other NWSL players struggle to make ends meet; the league minimum is $15,000, up from $7,200 last year.
Jim O'Connor-USA TODAY Sports
For so long, the national team had been Winters' all-consuming goal, and suddenly she had it. She had security that came with it, too.
“Before I had the contract, I felt like I had nothing to lose. I was just going for it, and I was playing pretty well. As soon as I got that contract, I had something to lose. I think that psychology led to the slump that I found myself in.”
Fretting over her standing led to a pair of ill-fated career moves, as well. Advised by then-U.S. coach Pia Sundhage that, to stay in the fold, she would be best served looking abroad, Winters jumped at the first opportunity – even if her gut warned her that Germany's Turbine Potsdam, under notorious taskmaster Bernd Schröder, wasn't the right fit.
She was called into national team camp under Sundhage's replacement, Tom Sermanni, early the next year, and despite playing hurt and with fragile confidence, Winters went anyway.
“I was wrecked. But I was on contract and I felt so much pressure,” Winters said. “‘OK, I'll come in.' I played like crap. I wish I would've told Tom that I was in a bad place. ‘You can take my contract, but I don't want to come in.'”
It might not have mattered. Shortly after that January camp, Winters was dropped from the team.
Winters soldiered on for four more seasons with the Seattle Reign, where she was named captain as the heartbeat of back-to-back regular-season champions. When it became apparent that she was unlikely to ever get another serious opportunity with the national team, though, she began plotting her next move.
She spent most of last season rushing home after practices to change into a business suit for one job interview or another.
Winters, who goes by Keelin Pattillo in her post-playing career and following her 2015 marriage, retired this past offseason at the age of 27. She has since been hired by the Kirkland Fire Department in the Seattle suburbs. She's currently working as a probationary firefighter in what is essentially a yearlong tryout.
The decision brought her peace, and not only because she finds her second act so fulfilling.
“My whole pro career was thinking about what's next, and what I was going to do after soccer, purely for the financial reason,” Winters said.
Would she still be playing if that last part wasn't such a pressing concern? “There's a good possibility,” Winters said. “I don't think I would've been as quick to make my decision to move on from soccer.”
NEXT: Getting dropped means lost money, health insurance and more

As anyone thinking about enrolling in a college or university knows, tuition is not cheap. The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA) notes that since the early 1980s, tuition has risen by approximately 7 percent a year, causing two-thirds of students to borrow to complete their degrees. Although grants and outright scholarships exist, part of the problem, NASFAA's website explains, is that “in 1975 the states picked up 60 percent of the tab while families shouldered 33 percent” and the federal government picked up the balance. Thirty-eight years later, the states pay approximately 34 percent and the feds pay 16 percent, leaving students and their families to shell out – often through loans – the remaining half.
And it's getting worse. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, since the start of the recession in 2008, “cuts to higher education have been severe and almost universal.” As a result, every state except North Dakota and Wyoming spends less on student aid than it did five years ago.

Worse, as staggering as these numbers are, when gender enters the mix, the impact is heightened. There are two reasons for this: First, there are more women than men on campus – 56.4 percent vs. 43.6 percent nationwide. Secondly, females earn less than men in virtually every occupation, from business to medicine to the arts, but pay the same amount to go to school, making any outstanding loans a larger repayment burden.
This finding was underscored by a study conducted by the American Association of University Women and released in October 2012 that found that women earn 82 percent of what men earn; one year after finishing college, women's salaries averaged $35,296, compared with $42,918 for men. This is far from chump change: Over a lifetime, the AAUW estimates that the disparity amounts to half a million dollars less for female workers, a reality that makes a direct, heavy impact on the possibility of repaying loans.
The study further documents the impact of loan repayment on women's everyday lives: 47 percent of women told the AAUW that they pay more than 8 percent of their net earnings toward their loans, while only 39 percent of men pay this percentage. What's more, 20 percent of women expend more than 15 percent of their take-home salaries on educational debt.
The long-term repercussions of this are stark: The pay gap, compounded by large monthly loan payments, means that most women save far less than men. This directly correlates to higher poverty rates for women as they age. To wit, by the time women hit their mid- to late 60s, 11 percent are living in poverty, compared with 6 percent of men. The loan imbalance also decreases women's likelihood of retirement.
Another study, this one called The Strategic National Arts Alumni Project Survey, looks at whether arts graduates are able to pursue their chosen fields after college. In its most recent iteration, researchers scrutinized the 2011 and 2012 earnings of 65,837 alumni from 120 US and Canadian colleges and universities. They defined arts broadly to include architecture, choreography, creative writing, filmmaking, fine arts, graphic design, illustration, interior design, photography, theater and videography. They found that while 56 percent of males were earning an annual salary of $50,000 or more, only 36 percent of comparably educated females had reached this earnings threshold. The upshot, SNAAP concluded, was that “loan debt determines if graduates can even work as artists.”
It's a situation that Jennifer Stohlmann, a 2011 graduate of Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, knows well. Thanks to large merit grants and three years as a resident adviser and part-time office worker, Stohlmann's $180,000 education involved minimal borrowing – $26,000 for a bachelor's degree in creative writing. Nonetheless, she did not pursue a career as a writer after she graduated – and won't do so until her debts are paid off in 2021. “I realized that I needed a steady salary in order to pay my loans without damaging my credit,” she said. “The cost of living in New York City is high, but I live a good lifestyle and am financially independent.” Still, Stohlmann, 24 and single, acknowledges that she has had to make concessions. “I live with a roommate instead of having my own apartment. I rely solely on public transportation. Car ownership is a pipe dream.”
Mathematics major Stephanie Lee (a pseudonym), age 26, borrowed $63,000 to attend the University of Michigan as an out-of-state resident and has not been as fortunate as Stohlmann. She presently works three jobs and lives at home so that she can make a dent on her debt. “After graduating in 2010, I considered a lot of options,” she told Truthout. “While in school, I heavily considered working for the government or working in math research, but I decided I would like to use my math skills in a business setting such as project management or consumer insights.” It hasn't happened. “Having little practical experience in these fields makes it difficult to even get interviews for entry-level positions,” she said. Instead, Lee works at a long-term temp job that pays $18 an hour. She also has a weekend job in retail, where she earns $10 an hour, and runs a once-monthly workshop for teens at the local library for $150 a shot. “My car gave out last December, and I haven't been able to save up to buy another,” she said. “I also haven't been able to move from my mother's suburban Illinois home, travel, go on vacation, or indulge in personal wants.” On the upside, however, Lee will have paid off one loan by the end of 2013, another by the end of 2016 and a third by the end of 2018.
Paying off debt – however distant the date – is something that Stohlmann and Lee can envision. This is not the case for 27-year-old Midwesterner Lisa Romero [a pseudonym]. Romero attended an Ivy League college for undergraduate and graduate study then went to the United Kingdom for medical school. The total owed: $350,000. “Over the next 20 or more years, I'll be paying nearly $750,000 thanks to interest on both my subsidized and unsubsidized loans,” she said. “Right now I'm doing a research fellowship. But when I'm ready to choose a residency, I'm going to have to go to wherever the cost of living is lowest. This means I'll likely be far from my family and won't be able to visit for a weekend since every train fare or flight is money I could be using to repay my loans. I want to go into obstetrics/gynecology. Many of the American medical students I know are going into dermatology, plastic surgery or radiology, rather than primary care, because these fields pay more and it will be easier for them to pay back their loans. This is not what we should be encouraging.”
Chanel Dubofsky, a 34-year-old graduate student at the Vermont College of Fine Arts, agrees that minimizing living costs is essential. Like Stephanie Lee, Dubofsky has several jobs. But because her rent is just $450 a month, she has so far managed to keep the creditors at bay. Nevertheless, by the time she finishes her master's degree in 2015, she will owe $56,000, $20,000 of it from her years as an undergraduate at the University of Massachusetts. “It wasn't an option for me not to borrow as an undergraduate, because without loans, I wouldn't have been able to attend college,” she said. “My mom and grandmother, who raised me, organized my loan stuff and signed off on it, but we never talked about what it would mean to have to pay it off.”
Dubofsky's financial education took a dramatic turn when she was 19 and her mother died. Seemingly overnight, she had to manage her own money, find part-time work and finish school – the only way she knew to achieve some modicum of social and intellectual mobility.
Likewise, Stacey Browne (a pseudonym). Now in her late 30s, Browne is married, has a 12-year-old son, and lives in Buffalo, New York. “I went to the Eugene Lang College in New York City in the 1990s,” she says. “Tuition was $16,000, plus costs for room and board. I went there because I grew up in a small New England town – only 6,000 residents – that was economically depressed with mostly factory jobs that were steadily being off-shored to China. It was important to me to get out of that town and get to New York. I liked Lang because it was a small college smack-dab in the middle of a huge city. It offered a feeling of community, but the city itself served as the campus.” Browne later earned a master's in library science and now works as a business consultant.
Her educational debt? Approximately $53,000 for her bachelor's and master's. Unfortunately, that's just the tip of a large loan iceberg: She and her spouse owe an additional $100,000 for his bachelor's, MBA and pharmacology degrees. “We moved to Buffalo because we were state residents and the State University of New York was damned cheap compared to the other possibilities,” Browne said. “We were able to buy a house and pay a mortgage of $410 a month. We also pay $1,000 a month in student loans, but the cost of living in Buffalo makes it possible for us to be OK.”
Was it worth it? “I have regrets,” she said.
Others voice similar sentiments. “I've spoken to a lot of people who've gone to law school or medical school, and most say they would not do it again,” Dr. Lisa Romero said. “Even if they now have good jobs, they think it was a mistake to get so deeply in debt.”
Isaac Seman is accused of child molestation (Columbia County Sheriff's Office)
A Georgia man has been charged with child molestation after police said that he encouraged his 10-year-old son to engage in sex acts with at dog, and recorded it all on video.
Augusta Crime reported that 35-year-old Isaac Seman was arrested on Tuesday after authorities were notified that the boy had shown the YouTube video to students at his school.
The video was still online when Seman was arrested on Tuesday, but it had been taken down by Wednesday afternoon.
An incident report filed by the Columbia County Sheriff's Office said that the video showed Seman telling the boy to reenact the movie “Brokeback Mountain” with the dog.
According to WAGT, Seman coerced the dog into “humping” his son. And then he told the 10-year-old boy to “grab the dog's hips and give it to him,” the incident report said.
Seman allegedly masturbated the dog, and then encouraged his son to do the same. After the boy masturbated the dog, Seman also masturbated the dog again, the incident report said.
Sheriff's Capt. Steve Morris said that the department declined to file animal cruelty charges, and chose to file child molestation and enticing charges instead.
Gay Teacher Files Sex Discrimination Claim Against Georgia School
Enlarge this image toggle caption Adam Ragusea/Georgia Public Broadcasting Adam Ragusea/Georgia Public Broadcasting
For the past four years, Flint Dollar has been teaching music at Mount de Sales Academy, a Catholic school in Macon, Ga. He is, by all accounts, beloved by his students.
But Dollar won't be leading the band or teaching the chorus in the fall. His contract was not renewed after administrators found out he plans to marry a man.
Under federal anti-discrimination laws, employers are not prohibited from hiring or firing people on the basis of sexual orientation. Dollar is working to change that.
He says when he was hired, he was honest with school administrators about his sexual orientation. But a month ago, just as Dollar was letting his students out for summer, he was called to see the school president.
"When you're called in the last part of the day on the last day of the week, it's not a good sign," Dollar says. "I was told that ... the bishop of the Diocese of Savannah called and expressed his concern that if I was to return it would be against the teachings of the Catholic Church."
What changed? Well, Dollar had announced on Facebook that he plans to marry his longtime partner in Minnesota this summer. The Catholic Church's position against same-sex marriage is clear, and the diocese says it supports the school in its decision to let Dollar go.
School officials, without addressing this case specifically, released a statement saying they have to consider an employee's ability to teach Catholic doctrine when making staff decisions.
"I was told very specifically I didn't do anything wrong, that there were no parent complaints, no student complaints, but regardless, I would not be returning," Dollar says. "I'm still kind of processing that."
Since neither federal law nor state law in Georgia expressly forbids employers from discriminating against gays, it initially seemed like there was nothing Dollar could do. But Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which turned 50 this week, does prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex. Dollar's lawyer, Charles Cox, sees an opening there.
"When you fire somebody because they are engaging in a same-sex marriage, I think that pretty clearly fits with gender discrimination," Cox says. "You're being fired because you're not complying with traditional gender stereotypes, and that's wrong, and we believe it's unlawful."
Enterprising lawyers have been making that argument since at least the 1990s, and federal courts have been saying "nice try" just as long. But in April, a judge in Washington made a ruling in a lawsuit brought by federal employee Peter TerVeer. TerVeer claims his supervisor at the Library of Congress made his work life miserable because TerVeer is gay.
LGBT rights attorney Greg Nevins, who is helping with TerVeer's case, explains how TerVeer sued under Title VII:
"His romantic or intimate interest in men is something that the women workers at the office were not penalized for, but he was," Nevins says. "He made that claim in federal district court, and the court allowed it to proceed, despite a motion to dismiss by the Department of Justice."
Now the TerVeer case is giving hope to people like Dollar. He's filed a complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or EEOC, alleging sex discrimination. Matthew Franck, a constitutional scholar at Princeton, says that might work — but it shouldn't.
"I realize that in half a century a lot of judicial interpretation has gone into the application of Title VII," Franck says, "but I think it's fairly clear that Title VII's reference to sex as a category of discrimination, that the people who wrote that had nothing like sexual orientation in their minds. It was not contemplated."
The EEOC said in a 2012 case that discrimination against transgender people constitutes sex discrimination. Franck says he's not a fan of that either, but he thinks it's at least closer to the original intent of the Civil Rights Act.
Back in Georgia, Dollar is playing organ part time at a Presbyterian church while he looks for a job and fights his case. He says getting his old position back is not the goal.
"I don't want anybody else to have to go through what I've been through," he says. "This last month has been up and down. It's been painful. There are days that I don't want to get out of bed."
But as the courts keep rapidly changing the way they view sexual orientation, Dollar hopes that he may be among the last generation of people who risk losing their job because they're gay.
The U.S. military's small, but growing, arsenal of armed robots has a new addition. Bot-maker Foster-Miller has shipped the first of its new killer machines to the Defense Department's Combatting Terrorism Technology Support Office.
The 350-pound MAARS (Modular Advanced Armed Robotic System) machine can carry a 40mm grenade launcher or a M240B medium machine gun. Or, if the robot's operators want their killer 'bot to be a little less-lethal, the thing can be equipped with a laser dazzler, a loudspeaker, or pepper spray.
After years of safety testing and modifications, three of MAARS kill-bot predecessors were sent to Iraq in 2007. But after nearly nine months in the field, safety concerns (among other reasons) have kept those machines from firing a shot in combat.
So MAARS' makers keep emphasizing how safe their lethal machine is. Software controls allow the robot's driver to select fire and no-fire zones. A mechanical range fan keeps MAARS' gun pointed away from friendly positions. "MAARS was developed with safety as the number one goal... [and] will continue to be tested exhaustively under various conditions in the coming months to ensure full compliance with standards and a safety release for fielding," the company says in a statement, which goes on to reinforce that the robot is "human-operated."

In the first episode of Netflix's Stranger Things, there's a slip of an X-Men reference. It's tiny, barely there.
"Race back to my place? Winner gets a comic," Dustin says, as he and Will speed home.
"Any comic?" Will says, before taking off into the darkness. "I'll take your X-Men 134!"
That mention of a specific X-Men comic is the last thing Will says to his friend, and to the audience, before disappearing. And it's not just a random comic book in Dustin's collection.
Uncanny X-Men No. 134 is one of the most popular and significant issues in X-Men canon. It kicks off the most important X-Men story in Marvel history, and it contains the first appearance of one of the most destructive forces in the X-Men universe. And viewed through the lens of Stranger Things, it's both a taste of what's to come on the show and an homage to the X-Men character known as Jean Grey.
Spoilers follow for Stranger Things season one.
What happens in X-Men N o. 134?
When comic book fans talk about the X-Men, there are usually two things that stand out: Magneto and the Phoenix Saga. Both are iconic. Both are crucial to the story of the X-Men. Both are about the idea of villainy, about our concept of evil and consequence. X-Men No. 134 focuses on one of these:
X-Men No. 134, written by Chris Claremont and drawn by John Byrne, was published in 1980 and marks the beginning of what's known as the Dark Phoenix Saga.
An abridged version: The X-Man known as Jean Grey comes into contact with the cosmic force known as the Phoenix. The Phoenix is basically the LeBron James of psionic, cosmic forces; he gives Jean great power, and helps her repair a nexus of universes called the M'Kraan Crystal.
The Phoenix's actions do not go unnoticed.
Bad dudes who belong to an organization known as the Hellfire Club abduct Jean Grey, and one of them — a guy named Mastermind who has the power to create illusions — uses his powers on Jean to tap into her potential (by basically making her live through strange aristocratic cosplay — comics are weird). The Hellfire Club wants to use her as a weapon.
After all this weird LARPing, Jean eventually breaks free from Mastermind's control — but by that point, it's far too late. He has awakened the entity known as Dark Phoenix, and everyone is shaken:
This is where Stranger Things fans should notice some similarities: X-Men 134 also features a young girl/woman who can move things with her mind; some bad men have lied to said girl and want to use her for nefarious purposes; and a monster has been awakened because the men tampered with her mind.
The connection between Stranger Things, the X-Men, and Jean Grey
In the final episode of Stranger Things season one, Eleven pins the monster against the wall. It's a last resort. She and her friends are trapped, and Eleven goes into fight-or-flight mode. She taps into some carnal anger and drops every ounce of her powers on it. There's a shot that looks just like the moment when Jean Grey unleashes on Mastermind at the end of X-Men No. 134.
After rereading the comic, I found myself rewatching earlier Stranger Things episodes in search of any other hints or clues. In the second episode, Eleven is intrigued by one of Mike's trophies with a winged woman on it, and in the background there's a lightning bolt-ish pattern:
This could totally be interpreted as a nod to the Phoenix.
However, before we (I) go too crazy combing through each frame of Stranger Things' eight episodes with an eye for X-Men references, it's important to keep in mind that while there are similarities between the two stories, they aren't perfect parallels of each other.
The X-Men saga spins out into a tale of planetary destruction, punishment, and love. Stranger Things feels more intimate, more about childhood and the loss of it. The monsters are a bit different, too. The Phoenix uses Jean Grey as a host, while Stranger Things' monster is more independent — it doesn't seem to need Eleven to live or die.
What the two stories have in common, and what being an X-Men fan made me like about Stranger Things, is the story of Eleven learning how to be human. Her friendship with the boys, her love of frozen waffles, and her ultimate sacrifice are all elements of Jean Grey's story, too.
Even Eleven's death is similar to Jean's.
In X-Men No. 137, toward the conclusion of the Dark Phoenix Saga, Jean realizes she's responsible for the deaths of innocent people (in particular, the Phoenix obliterates a planet while using her as a host). Jean decides to kill the monster by sacrificing herself, because she knows that every minute she continues to live is a risk to innocent lives. She dies in front of her love, Scott Summers, a.k.a. Cyclops:
When Eleven dies, it's on a smaller, younger scale. Like Jean, she knows the monster she's brought into this world won't stop killing. She's the only person who can stop it. So she has to kill it. She wants to protect her friends ... even if it means killing herself and breaking Mike's heart (both Mike and Cyclops brace themselves and cover their eyes when Jean/Eleven die).
At the end of X-Men No. 137, Uatu the Watcher — a cosmic character in charge of watching our world — makes a keen observation. He tells us that Jean's sacrifice (and, by extension, Eleven's) is what makes us all human. Both characters could have moved on with their lives and started anew. But that would have meant abandoning the people who showed them love.
"Jean Grey could have lived to become a god," Uatu says. "But it was more important to her that she die … a human."
The same could be said of Eleven.
Jean Grey eventually comes back. Eleven has to, too, right?
At the end of their respective stories, Eleven and Jean Grey disintegrate. The only trace that remains of either of them is a crater and a cloud of ash.
Anyone who follows the X-Men will tell you that Jean Grey is never really dead. In her most recent rebirth, she came back as a teen. In the past, she came back after spending some time in a cocoon in the bottom of the ocean. There are only a few characters in comic books who stay dead, and Jean Grey is not one of them. The woman is literally connected to a cosmic force named after a creature whose magical power is rebirthing itself, over and over.
So does this mean Eleven will come back too? That's why Hopper is leaving things in that box, right? If Eleven is Jean, then Eleven must be like the Phoenix?
What's fascinating is that the end of the Dark Phoenix Saga actually doubles as a full-fledged X-Men introduction to Kitty Pryde (she appears in an earlier issue but joins the team in X-Men No. 138 and 139). It's a hopeful, optimistic turn after several issues full of pain and sadness.
Introducing a Kitty-esque new character to Stranger Things could make a lot of sense in the show's world — a new school year, a new girl, a new start. But that's me getting ahead of myself.
Netflix has yet to officially renew Stranger Things for season two, but the show is practically guaranteed to return. And, yes, Hopper leaving the treats Eleven likes in that box in the woods is a signal that deep down, he believes she's coming back. We'll all be there, watching and waiting for her.
In June 2017, California Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon singlehandedly prevented a single-payer health care bill, SB 562, to be put up for a vote in the State Assembly after the State Senate passed it. Rendon called the bill “wholly incomplete,” but his decision halted the processes that would have enabled its completion. In California, the Democratic Party holds a supermajority in the State Legislature and the governorship, providing a straightforward path to enact progressive policies.
Rendon's and other establishment Democrats' excuses for shutting down the bill were riddled with hypocrisy and lies. Since 2012, Rendon and top California Democrats have received over $2.2 million in campaign donations from the pharmaceutical and health care industries. Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown would face national embarrassment if he vetoed the bill, as former Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger had done twice before.
Speaker Rendon has denigrated progressives in the Democratic Party by shutting down the bill and insisting that they concede to establishment Democrats. On July 10, he told Politico, “We're still a big tent party, but we have folks within our Democratic Caucus throughout the state really who are Democrats, but who are moderate Democrats.” Regardless of the political makeup of the state, the bill should have been allowed to receive a vote in the State Assembly, but Rendon prevented that all the while telling progressive activists that he supports single-payer health care. Rendon holds one of the most powerful positions in the state of California, but he tells voters that he is powerless to allow a vote on a policy he believes in.
Because of Rendon's ineptitude as an elected official, single-payer health care proponents have begun efforts to recall him from office. Last week, Rendon's office was notified of the intent for a recall petition to be circulated in his assembly district.
“If we recall the Assembly speaker, maybe someone else [will be] willing to push this bill, to get it out of the rules committee and send it to the Assembly to get a vote on it,” said Jessica Covarrubias, a proponent of the effort, in an interview with The Los Angeles Times. “Maybe that will help everyone get health care.”
The notice of a recall petition was filed by Stephen Elzie, a USC law professor who is serving as the lead attorney for the recall effort. The National Nurses United, which has led the single-payer health care efforts in California and across the country, is not directly involved with the recall effort but is continuing to put pressure on Rendon and other Democrats to make the policy a reality.
On August 2, the Recall Rendon Facebook page announced, “We have received confirmation from the Secretary of State that our Notice of Intent has been reviewed for compliance with the California Elections Code, and that our signatures have been verified by the County of Los Angeles. Our petition drive is on track to begin this month. Ware holding weekly meetings every Tuesday in Assembly District 63, and will be holding our first major fundraiser on the evening on Friday, August 18.”
We Can Have Single-Payer In Washington State by 2020, If We Want It
It's starting to seem a little more possible. JUSTIN SULLIVAN / GETTY
There are a handful of single-payer bills sitting in Olympia right now, just waiting to get some action. If you're tired of paying more money for worse health care coverage, if you count half a million Washington residents living without health insurance even with the Affordable Care Act in place as a moral failure, and if the thought of demonstrably inefficient health insurance companies profiting off the plight of the sick makes you sick, then what you need to do is call Rep. Eileen Cody, D-Seattle, and demand hearings on a bill sponsored by Rep. Sherry Appleton, D-Poulsbo (HB 1026). Then call Sen. Ann Rivers, R-La Center, and demand hearings on a separate bill sponsored by Sen. David Frockt, D-Seattle (SB 5701).
You should also call your own State Rep and Senator and tell them you want them to move on this. If you don't know who that person is, find them using this handy tool.
That's it. That's all you need to do right now. The next legislative session won't start until January 2018, but completely overhauling a state's health care system is time consuming, and there will be a few potential snags that I'll talk about here in a second, but we can't even start to argue about all of this stuff until constituents start applying pressure. So, for now:
Rep. Eileen Cody: (360) 786-7978 Sen. Ann Rivers: (360)-786-7634
The people you will call: Rep. Eileen Cody and Sen. Ann Rivers Washington State Legislature
Call them and tell them you want them to hold hearings on the bills.
But in case you want to know a little bit more:
Here's What's In Those Bills
Before we get going, you should know that there are three single-payer bills in the state Senate right now. Sen. Maralyn Chase, D-Shoreline, introduced the most ambitious bill, which is based on the California model that failed this summer. Sen. Bob Hasagawa, D-Seattle, also has a bill, but with a few minor exceptions it's the same bill as the ones introduced by Senator David Frockt and Rep. Appleton. Their proposals have been around for the longest time and seem most promising to me.
According to the language of Frockt's bill, legislators would create a board representing "Washington citizens, business, labor, and health professions" who have "expertise in health care financing and delivery." This group would be selected through "public hearings, research, and consensus building," and they'd be required to demonstrate "knowledge of the health care needs of diverse populations, including low-income, Native American, undocumented, non-English speaking, disabled, rural, and other minority populations."
They'll also set up three separate committees (financial, citizens', and technical) to make appropriate recommendations about how to pay for stuff, what stuff to pay for, how to deliver that stuff to everybody in Washington, and how to monitor everything for "quality assurance and cost containment."
The benefits package they come up with "shall include but is not limited to":
(a) Inpatient and outpatient hospital care, including twenty-four hour a day emergency services and emergency ambulance services; (b) outpatient, home-based, and office-based care; (c) rehabilitation services, including speech, occupational, and physical therapy; (d) inpatient and outpatient mental health services and substance abuse treatment; (e) hospice care; (f) prescription drugs and prescribed medical nutrition; (g) vision and hearing care; (h) diagnostic tests; (i) durable medical equipment; (j) preventive care; and (k) any other benefits defined as 'essential health benefits' under the federal patient protection and affordable care act.
The proposal from Appleton and Frockt also instructs the board to come up with a plan for dental coverage the following year.
If all goes smoothly, which it probably won't, but it might if there's lots of pressure, then by May 2020 the the state of Washington will be the primary insurance company in town. (Private insurance companies would also exist to serve those who want to supplement their plan.)
Rep. Sherry Appleton and Sen. David Frockt Washington State Legislature
How Are They Going To Pay For It?
They're going to tax the blood of Republican children. Jk.
Like Bernie Sanders's Medicare for All bill, HB 1026 and SB 5701 provide a framework for discussion. And like Bernie Sanders's Medicare for All bill, people will dismiss them as meaningless shells that lack substance. Those people wouldn't be 100 percent wrong, but they wouldn't be right, either. HB 1026 and SB 5701 are built to be "shells." The idea is to describe the single-payer plan, talk about how we can pay for it over the course of several hearings, and hear out the opposition. In 2019, a bill responsive to all that input will be introduced. That bill will have all the substance that everyone's looking for.
But just because there's no exact financing information in the current legislation doesn't mean they don't know how they're going to pay for it.
In wildly simplified terms, the general goal is to take the money that people and corporations pay into the private health insurance markets and dump it all into one public market.
Right now, the private insurance markets are obscenely vast and complicated. There's large group, small group, and individual markets, along with Medicare, Medicaid, and the VA. All of those are separate insurance markets with separate rules, separate financing, separate benefits, separate everything, and it's all so confusing that at least 30 percent of our private insurance costs go to managing the administrative burden caused by that system. Plus, it doesn't even cover everybody! By switching to a single-payer system, those administrative costs would be significantly reduced, and every single resident of Washington state would have health insurance.
In addition to saving money on administrative costs, some of the funding for the bill would come from tax deductible "employer assessments" and personal premiums for adults. Basically, in lieu of offering benefits, employers would pay a fee to the state based on their size. And instead of individuals paying through their employers or through private insurance, they would pay a monthly fee and maybe a small co-pay as well. Overall, assuming we get sick at some point in our lives, everyone in Washington will be spending less money for health insurance over time.
Proponents of the bill also want to use a lot of existing state and federal money, but some of that will be a little tricky. We might, for example, be able to ask the federal government for an "innovation waiver" so we can apply the funds the state receives for the ACA to the statewide single-payer program, but those details are currently being worked out in "the bipartisan fix" to the ACA. (It's worth noting that Republicans know blue states want to do this, and they're actively trying to stop states from taking such measures.) Moreover, Washington state might be able to get Medicaid waivers, but no federal legislation exists yet to allow for Medicare or VA waivers. So, tricky given the current administration, but not impossible.
Some Things We Might Learn From Recent Single-Payer Failures
If you've been following the news of single-payer stalling out in New York and California, you're right to be skeptical about Washington's chances of passing a similar measure. But there are lessons to be learned.
The single-payer bill got held up in New York because Republicans control the state Senate, and, being Republicans, they killed the bill. Such a death will likely befall the bill here unless we flip the Washington Senate by electing Manka Dhingra. If you live in the 45th LD, or even if you don't, now would be a good time to be knocking on doors for Dhingra.
But even if Democrats gain control of both houses here in Washington, some centrist tool could kill the bill because he doesn't want to work hard, which is what happened this summer in California. The Speaker of California's Assembly, Anthony Rendon, pulled the measure because "the bill was 'woefully incomplete' because it did not address serious issues such as 'financing, delivery of care, cost controls, or the realities of needed action by the Trump administration and voters,'" he said in a statement.
A spokesperson for the California Nurses Association, who basically wrote that bill, told the New Republic that, by denying the legislature the opportunities to hold hearings and discuss amendments that would provide all the answers Rendon was looking for, the Speaker was basically saying that the Assembly didn't want to do its job.
The lesson: Democratic majorities like the one in California, and like the one we may get in Washington this November, are meant to be used, not maintained. If any centrist Democrat kills single-payer for some myopic political reason, or because they don't want to do the work of holding hearings and working through problems, they are not accurately weighing the financial and moral consequences of living in a state where over 500,000 people don't have insurance.
But if they work hard and work together, with a mob of patient and diligent and reasonably concerned constituents at their back, Democrats may be able to pass this thing. If they build a model that works, then other states will follow. And if those followers can show single-payer working at the state level, then the nation will follow.
Just to Review
If covering everyone in Washington State and paying less money to do so sounds good to you, call these people and tell them to hold hearings on the bill in January.
Rep. Eileen Cody: (360) 786-7978 Sen. Ann Rivers: (360)-786-7634
If Manka Dhingra gets elected in November, Sen. Annette Cleveland, D-Vancouver, will presumably take over as chair of the Senate Health Care Committee. If that happens, start calling her and demanding the same thing: (360) 786-7696.
If you want to do more than just call people, you can join an advocacy group called Health Care for All-WA. They've been around since 1998, but they're starting to gain some traction. I think it's because everything is so bad right now and everyone's dying and yet private health insurance profits are soaring. Anyway, they have a bunch of resources on their website, including a four-year plan to pass and implement this measure.
BROWNSVILLE, Tex. — Joel Luna was just the kind of job candidate the Border Patrol covets. He grew up on both sides of the border, in Mexico and South Texas. He participated in the Reserve Officers Training Corps in high school and later served in the Army, seeing combat in Iraq.
Mr. Luna joined the agency as part of a hiring surge that began under the George W. Bush administration, patrolling a rural area about 100 miles north of Mexico. But six years later, his decorated career came to a shocking end: He was arrested and charged with helping to send illegal weapons to Mexico and ship drugs into the United States. He was convicted in January and sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Now, as President Trump plans a similar hiring surge at the Border Patrol, Mr. Luna's case is casting a large shadow. The president wants to make 5,000 new hires, under a streamlined process that critics fear could open a door to other rogue agents like Mr. Luna.
Agency officials, some members of Congress and the Border Patrol union say the current process has made it too hard to hire agents. It typically takes more than a year to vet candidates and get them on the job.
On April 9, Pearl Jam will indeed invade Miami-Wade County as their North American tour kicks off with a rare run through Florida.
Being a good host, the Miami Heat star has given the band the key to American Airlines Arena, otherwise known as Wade's house, along with an invite to Eddie Vedder and the band to shoot hoops whenever they'd like. In a video posted on the team's Facebook page, which fittingly starts out with a clip of Wade burying Vedder's Chicago Bulls in 2009 with a dramatic buzzer beater, the star guard welcomes the band to his house, and offers up an invite to play some hoops.
While Vedder may fancy himself more of a baseball guy, bassist Jeff Ament just might take Wade up on his challenge. Although if Ament can't get past Win Butler, he might have some trouble getting through the three-time NBA Champion.

Excellent review, as always.
It's interesting, I agree with much of what you say, but don't have quite the negative view of the system as you do.
I haven't looked very closely at the Cypher System rule book - I've been mostly focused on the system as written in Numenera - I wonder if that makes the difference? I do think the system isn't well-suited to the horror genre - there are systems that really do that much better and I would see no reason to use the Cypher System instead of one of those. I don't play superhero RPGs so I can't really tell, but I suspect it is similar to my horror genre feeling.
I wonder if my opinion will change after a play through? Since I am staying in a gamma-world-esque science fantasy setting, I think Numenera will be well suited to the type of game I will be running... After reading your review I am fairly convinced that the system probably isn't truly suited to be a generic system. I wonder if the core system book was a response to fans more than a burning desire on the part of the designers?
“It shows you that a lot more people are hurting,” Mr. Bickford said. “Even with the more restrictive law in place, the filings are back up to the prelaw level.”
The law, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, made it more difficult for consumers to erase their debts through Chapter 7 bankruptcies. Those who earn more than their state's median income are now required to first pass a means test — based on income, living expenses and other factors. If they are deemed able to repay some debts, they are then forced to pursue a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which sets up a three- or five-year repayment plan and makes it more difficult to get a fresh start.
“In a nutshell, bankruptcies happen because financial distress happens,” said Jack Williams, resident scholar at the American Bankruptcy Institute and a bankruptcy professor at the Georgia State University College of Law. “It is hubris to think that we can manage such a complex system by inserting a means test here, a credit counseling requirement there.”
Keith and Leola Gladney of St. Charles, Mo., filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy last summer. Their problems began to unfold in September 2007, when Mrs. Gladney, who was pregnant, was put on bed rest and could no longer work as a marketing assistant. They lost her income, though she did receive short-term disability payments. In January 2008, Mr. Gladney, 38, lost his job as a manager of an auto parts store. Within months, the couple had fallen behind on the mortgage payments on their home, which they bought for $130,000 in 2004.
They lost the house around the time their son was born in March 2008, and the couple had to move into a hotel with their newborn. Though they eventually found an apartment to rent, the Gladneys decided to file for bankruptcy. Adding to their troubles, Mrs. Gladney, 37, found out last November that she did not have a job to return to.
“It is really stressful for me because I thought I would find another job,” she said.
Mr. Gladney said he was hopeful that he was close to receiving a job offer on one of the 30 or so résumés he sends out daily. “We are trying to keep our heads up and keep a positive attitude and hope things will get better,” he said. “We go to church every Sunday. We haven't changed our routine.”
If history is any guide, the number of bankruptcy filings will increase through this year, but will not jump as much as they did from February to March because that tends to be a popular time for filing, Professor Lawless said. But if legislation is passed that would allow bankruptcy judges to modify some primary mortgages, filings could rise significantly.

The House has approved a version of that so-called cramdown legislation, but the Senate did not have enough votes to overcome a filibuster by Republicans, who want the modifications to apply to a much smaller pool of loans. The Senate Democrats are working on a compromise, and say they hope they can bring the bill to the floor after Congress returns from recess on April 20.
The power to modify home mortgages would probably lead many more people to pursue bankruptcy to save their homes. If the legislation were to pass, Mr. Lawless said, 1.6 million would be a conservative estimate of the number of bankruptcy filings this year.
“We have to remember that prebankruptcy negotiations take place in the shadow of the bankruptcy law,” he added. “We would expect that banks would be more likely to come to the negotiation table.”
Regardless of what happens, the number of consumers filing for bankruptcy is expected to continue to climb even after the economy begins to recover.
“What is sobering about these numbers is that bankruptcy is generally a lagging economic indicator,” Professor Williams said. “So even as the economy starts to turn around down the road, we will still continue to see bankruptcy filings increase even past that turning point, and that trend will continue anywhere from three to five quarters.”
Hakiki: The Contender in the Newtown Area
Finally a Groupon deal that was worthwhile. I re-installed the app just for a 2 for 1 Hakiki deal. The Turkish ice-cream here is made from goats and cows milk with the exotic thickening ingredients. The texture is definitely not for licking, it is rather thick and elastic. Perfect for a really hot day as it tends to stay in the frozen state longer. The texture is similar to ricotta gelato but a little creamier. Despite the difference in texture compared to gelato, it just melted once in my mouth. Some choose to even chew on it. The flavours vary from Turkish classics like Turkish Delight and Baklava to Burnt Caramel and fruit-based ones.
Verdict
Hakiki is a serious alternative to Cow and Moon down the road. They have the warmth of a family run business that offers friendly service with a unique product. They do get creative with the flavours however, after a few visits I think that the Baklava and Turkish Delight are the best.
63-71 Enmore Road, Enmore, Sydney
NEW DELHI/DUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) - India is pressing rich countries in the Gulf to raise the wages of millions of Indians working there, in a drive that could secure it billions of dollars in fresh income but risks pricing some of its citizens out of the market.

Over 5 million Indian nationals are believed to be employed in the oil exporting states of the Gulf, the single largest group in a migrant worker population of more than 20 million.
Migrants do many of the dirty and dangerous jobs in the region, from construction to the oil industry, transport and services. They account for nearly half of the roughly 50 million population of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council.
So India's campaign for much higher pay could have an impact on economies around the region, especially if it leads to a general increase in wages for workers from other big labour-supplying countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh.
Over the past seven months, Indian diplomats in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have sharply increased the minimum salaries that they recommend for Indian workers at private and public firms in those states.
“We want the Indian workforce to be paid higher salaries. Inflation, the value of the Indian currency and a rise in the cost of living in the Gulf were the factors that led to the decision,” Y.S. Kataria, a spokesman for the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs (MOIA) in New Delhi, told Reuters.
The success of India's strategy is not yet clear, however. Officials in at least some GCC nations have expressed displeasure, and the strategy could backfire if those countries end up hiring more workers from elsewhere in the world.
“Of course it will encourage companies to look at Bangladesh and Pakistan as more viable options to get migrant workers,” said Mohammed Jindran, managing director of UAE-based recruitment agency Overseas Labour Supply.
PRESSURE
The Indian government cannot dictate the pay of its citizens in the Gulf - decisions to hire workers are made by labour recruiters in individual countries, which have not set minimum wages for migrants and usually prohibit union activity by them.
However, the recruiters must rely on the co-operation of local authorities to operate in India. An internal memorandum prepared by the MOIA, sent last month and seen by Reuters, says that if workers are offered wages below specified minimums, ministry officials “would deny emigration clearance”.
In Saudi Arabia, the Indian embassy lifted the recommended minimum salary posted on its website to 1,200 riyals ($320) a month earlier this year from 670 riyals. In the UAE, the minimum wage for Indian blue-collar workers rose to 1,500 dirhams ($409) in recent weeks from 1,200 dirhams last year, Jindran said.
Even when Gulf recruiters agree to certain wage levels, the numbers do not necessarily stick. Some workers are promised one salary when they sign up in their home country, then forced to renegotiate lower wages when they arrive in the Gulf.
India's role as a top labour supplier means its drive cannot be totally ignored by recruiters, and it could have a big impact in some countries and industries. But there may be a backlash.
Another MOIA official said India's pay demands had met initial resistance in all six GCC countries, while two of the countries had threatened to reduce their Indian workforces and hire more, lower-paid workers from Bangladesh and Nepal instead.
Ahmed Al-Fahaid, Saudi deputy labour minister for international affairs, told Sky News Arabia last month:
“If this is a decision that is applied throughout India as a whole, meaning no one gets out of India for work unless with that limit, then this is a sovereign decision for the country and we will not interfere,” Fahaid said.
“But if it is a special decision to raise wages for whoever comes to work in the kingdom, then we oppose it and do not accept it, as it would be an act of discrimination and we don't accept that in international agreements.” He did not elaborate.

IMPACT
If India's efforts to secure higher pay succeed, they could boost its economy, because migrants send much of their pay home. India received $69 billion as remittances in 2012; a 2010 central bank study found Gulf nations accounted for 31 percent.
Higher wages could also impact many companies. Fawwaz al-Khodari, chief executive of Saudi builder Abdullah Abdul Mohsin al-Khodari 1330.SE, said profits in the sector might be squeezed by demands from governments of some labour-exporting countries.
“In cases where salaries have been 800 to 900 riyals, we are now hearing talk of 1,500 riyals as a minimum salary, which is a huge increase...Clearly this would become a major issue in the contracting industry.”
Democrats feel better than ever about winning back the Senate majority.
Democratic leadership aides say a nine-seat pickup is not out of the question, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) has recruited aggressively in second- and third-tier races to take advantage of a possible tsunami.

The GOP is at a disadvantage because it has to defend 24 seats, while Democrats only have to protect 10. Democrats need a net gain of four seats and control of the White House to take back the Senate majority.

Senate Democrats are doing everything they can to link candidates in swing states to Trump, launching their “Party of Trump” campaign in March aimed at vulnerable GOP incumbents. The DSCC has reserved about $50 million worth of television airtime in the fall to hammer that message home.
Democratic voter turnout is expected to be considerably higher in November than in 2014, when Democrats lost their Senate majority in a wave.
Republicans are hoping that if Trump is a weak general-election candidate, voters will split their ballots.
“This is going to be a ticket-splitting kind of year,” McConnell said last week.
“What we're seeing in purple and blue states is a willingness to vote for the Republican incumbent coupled with voting for the Democratic nominee for president,” said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster.
“That's obviously good for Republican incumbents in places like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and New Hampshire and Illinois,” he added.
Republican incumbents also had fair warning that 2016 could be a difficult year and have not been caught unaware.
In Ohio, for example, Portman reported $13 million in cash on hand at the end of March while his Democratic opponent, former Gov. Ted Strickland, reported only $2.7 million. The Portman campaign released its first three television ads as part of a $15 million media buy and, he has launched a Hispanic leadership council.
Republicans argue their incumbents are well prepared and have strong records.
“It's a difficult cycle for us no matter what because we have a lot of incumbents up for reelection and no one promised us a rose garden, but we feel very good with where we're at and that's because incumbents have worked for the past year and a half to build state-of the-art campaigns,” said Andrea Bozek, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
If 2016 is going to be a huge year for Democrats, they'll need to win in more difficult states such as Arizona and North Carolina.
But they could be assisted by the fact that Trump's biggest negative impact could be in states with high concentrations of minority voters.
In Nevada, Trump's atrocious approval rating with Hispanic voters clouds Republican Rep. Joe Heck's chances of defeating state Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto, who would be the first Hispanic woman elected to the Senate.
“The combination of the potential to elect the first Latina to the Senate and Trump at the top of the ticket is quite toxic for Heck. The question is how toxic? Is it something he can overcome with some outside help?” said Jon Ralston, a prominent Nevada political commentator. “Trump is going to hurt Heck. Heck has fully embraced Trump so he's going to have to wear everything Trump has said.”
Seventeen percent of Nevada's eligible voters are Hispanic, according to the Pew Research Center.
Trump is also a significant liability in Arizona for McCain, who acknowledged to donors at a private event earlier this year that he's in the race of his life. Twenty-two percent of eligible voters in Arizona are Hispanic, according to Pew.
Senate Republicans are frustrated by the lack of any evidence that Trump is making an effort to discipline himself and ease off his penchant for gratuitous insults since locking up the nomination.
Trump on Thursday called a federal judge's Mexican heritage “an inherent conflict of interest” in his ability to preside fairly over a lawsuit against Trump University.
The week before, he slammed New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez (R), who was once considered a potential running mate, for “not doing her job” after she declined to endorse him.
McConnell called the attack on Martinez “a big mistake” and urged him to stop “gratuitous attacks on allies.”
Democrats are feeling emboldened by Trump's latest words.
“Before the advent of Trump, I thought it was looking good. Republicans have seats up in states that Obama won twice,” said Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist and former senior Senate aide. “It's a higher percentage that we take back the Senate.”
They are also confident their party will rally around Clinton once she sews up the nomination, despite a difficult primary contest with Bernie Sanders Bernard (Bernie) SandersPush to end U.S. support for Saudi war hits Senate setback Sanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' MORE. Clinton's speech last week, in which she lashed out at Trump, pumped up many of her supporters in the Senate.
Still, outside observers aren't ready to bet the House on a Democratic landslide in the Senate.
Jennifer Duffy, senior editor of the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan handicapper, says Democrats are “probably” favored to win the majority but adds, “I'm not yet convinced it's the blood bath they believe it is.”

Ten Senate seats most likely to flip
Attorney General Eric Holder, who today announced his plans to resign, has been a leader in addressing systems of racial discrimination and protecting the fundamental rights of every American to be treated equally under the law and participate in our democracy.
Perhaps it's not surprising, then, that the Right loves to hate him.
In February of this year, the American Family Association demanded Holder's impeachment after he had the audacity to treat married same-sex couples like married opposite-sex couples with regard to a host of legal rights and recognitions. Shortly after, both Faith and Freedom Coalition head Ralph Reed and Republican Rep. Tim Huelskamp echoed the call for Holder's impeachment because of his support for marriage equality. Televangelist Pat Robertson also joined the impeachment parade, alleging that under Holder, “sodomy” was being “elevated above the rights of religious believers.”
Holder's commitment to redressing racial injustice was no more warmly received by the Right than his work in support of LGBT equality. After Holder spoke out against voter ID laws, which disproportionately harm people of color, Texas Gov. Rick Perry accused him of “purposefully” “incit[ing] racial tension.” Gun Owners of America director Larry Pratt argued that Holder's open discussion of racial discrimination in the criminal justice system means that he is the real “racist,” asserting last year that Holder wants to “intimidate the rest of the country so that we don't think about defending ourselves” against “attacks by black mobs on white individuals.” Bryan Fischer of the American Family Association went so far as to say that Holder would never “prosecute someone if the victim is white.” And after Holder visited Ferguson, Missouri last month, David Horowitz outrageously commented that the attorney general was leading a black “lynch mob.”
And those are just a handful of the attacks the Right has leveled against Holder for his work protecting equality under the law.
The fact that the far Right has reacted with so much vitriol to the attorney general's leadership is a sign not only of how uninterested they are in the civil rights that the Justice Department is meant to protect, but also of how effective Holder's work has been. The next attorney general should shareholder's deep commitment to protecting the rights of all Americans – and, by extension, make all the “right” enemies among those hoping to turn back the clock on civil liberties.
This post originally appeared on the PFAW blog.
On WPShout, a WordPress blog we run, I recently wrote about how long it takes a developer to do a number of discrete jobs in WordPress. The post was motivated by a great article at another site about how much a WordPress site should cost.
The main reason so few people discuss website pricing is because “a website” can cost literally any amount to build.
Both of these articles contain a lot of statements to the effect of, “These numbers are the best we can make them, but please don't take any of them too seriously because they're likely to be way off from your actual experience.”
These statements are true, and necessary. The main reason so few people discuss website pricing is because “a website” can cost literally any amount to build, depending on your needs for it.
You wouldn't have the same problems in an article on, say, haircut prices—and an article like that wouldn't take nearly as much audacity to write in the first place. Why is this?
A big part of the reason is complexity. Let's look at that term as it relates to web projects.
Defining Complexity in Web Development
For a web developer, “complexity” can be defined as: Everything that is impossible or very difficult to know at the beginning of a project, and which only becomes clear during the project itself.
With complex web projects, almost the whole job is learning how to do the job itself.
The difference between a haircut and a web project is the degree of complexity. The job of giving a “men's haircut” can vary a good deal based on the man in question, but the process is largely understood before it is begun, making it easy to price predictably.
With complex web projects, however, almost the whole job is learning how to do the job itself. That's a lot trickier proposition.
An Analogy
Let's examine complexity through an analogy to an activity with some similarities to web development: putting together jigsaw puzzles.
Let's say you put jigsaw puzzles together professionally. Your clients want the puzzles put together as quickly and as cheaply as possible; they're likely to hire the lowest-bidding puzzle builder, but they'll also want the puzzle completed within that bid.
First, let's ask what your job is. It's not the manual process of putting pieces together. If you already know how everything fits together (say, if the pieces are numbered), then that process takes almost no time at all. What's more, it can be done by anyone, certainly by someone much cheaper than you.
Instead, you're being paid to figure out how the pieces all snap together—to work your way through the process of figuring out what you don't already know. You're being paid to wrangle with complexity.
Bidding on Complex Web Development Projects
The only thing you can do is guess, but you can guess with more or less skill.
So how do you estimate how long it'll take you to resolve the complexity of a puzzle? If you knew the nature of the puzzle's complexity, you'd already have solved it, and there would basically be no project (except maybe numbering all the pieces so someone else could snap them together for cheap). But there your employers are, wanting a firm number you're ready to stand behind…
The only thing you can do is guess.
You can guess with more or less skill. Inexperienced puzzle makers are prone to throwing out a low number that will satisfy their employers, and then either abandoning the project or taking huge financial losses when the estimate turns out to be unachievable.
Experienced puzzle makers follow some established practices to get their guess as close as possible to the truth:
Look at what is known about the puzzle.
Examining the image on the box—the finished product desired by the client—you may see one corner made of nearly uniformly colored clouds that you know will be a nightmare to put together, and another corner depicting a hill with a strong color gradient that will likely be a lot easier. Look at past experience and make a conservative estimate.
You may know that “most” 1000-piece puzzles take you around 12 hours to complete. However, those puzzles formed up into completely different images, and there's no way to know beforehand how long it will take you to have the 999 small epiphanies that make up this job. What if the puzzle designer, in a bad mood, decided to divide those flat-colored cloudbanks up into 100 almost-identical pieces? You could be stuck for days. You'll have to give your best guess and skew conservative—all without disgusting your clients so much they walk out. It's a delicate process that never really gets easy.
Hopefully, this extended analogy has given you a bit of an idea what it's like to bid on and execute complex development work. And, somewhat gratifyingly, I noticed that no one will give you a reliable answer for how long a 1,000-piece puzzle takes to complete—because of the complexity! So we're on the right track here.
If you consider the differences between puzzles and web projects, you'll realize that development work is significantly more unpredictable than puzzle assembling. For example, a web developer can hit dead ends, forcing him or her to rethink the final product itself.
Let's take a look at some of the major sources of complexity in web work.
Sources of Complexity in Web Development
Developers often don't know how to build a particular project until they've done it.
These are generic descriptions of some key reasons why developers often don't know how to build a particular project until they've done it. There are doubtless many others, but these crop up all the time:
Projects often require learning unfamiliar languages or programming practices.
For example, a project may be complex enough that it requires a language framework such as Laravel to manage the data. The developer may need to budget for time to learn the Laravel paradigm, despite not knowing how difficult this will be.
For example, a project may be complex enough that it requires a language framework such as Laravel to manage the data. The developer may need to budget for time to learn the Laravel paradigm, despite not knowing how difficult this will be. Projects often combine familiar elements in unfamiliar and untested ways.
For example, a project may need to combine a home-built system for complex data storage and manipulation with WordPress for easy site administration. These two blocks of software may interact confusingly.
For example, a project may need to combine a home-built system for complex data storage and manipulation with WordPress for easy site administration. These two blocks of software may interact confusingly. Projects often must work properly across numerous dissimilar environments.
For example, a website usually must work properly on numerous web browsers—each of which interprets HTML markup slightly differently, and some of which contain prominent flaws—and on numerous types of web-capable device, including computers, tablets, and smartphones of various sizes and resolutions. The steps needed to make all this work within a specific project usually only become clear during the project itself.
For example, a website usually must work properly on numerous web browsers—each of which interprets HTML markup slightly differently, and some of which contain prominent flaws—and on numerous types of web-capable device, including computers, tablets, and smartphones of various sizes and resolutions. The steps needed to make all this work within a specific project usually only become clear during the project itself. Errors and setbacks are often nearly impossible to predict.
For example, a web host may have a very restrictive memory limit or an obsolete version of PHP, causing significant problems when a site is migrated to it from other hosting. There is usually no good reason to suspect these problems before they happen, and there is no way to know how many of these types of problems will crop up and how difficult they will be to fix.
These fundamental sources of complexity are a big part of the reason why developers, acting in good faith, are prone to throw such crazy numbers around when they estimate a project.
How Complex is your Web Project?
Not all web projects are of equal complexity. Creating a simple site to display information about a small business, or a basic blog site, are both well-defined jobs with relatively little complexity. This means that it's possible to predict how long they take and how much they should cost with much more accuracy than less repeatable projects.
Your web project becomes more complex as it requires more novel tasks.
Other projects are much more complex, and it's hard to say much at all about them before diving in. In general, your web project becomes more complex as the number of novel tasks required to complete it increases. Anything a web developer has never done before is a pool of complexity.
Unfortunately, you, as a client, are not usually in a good place to judge what is and isn't novel about your project. However, you can talk to a lot of developers and ask them what pieces can be handled using established practices, and you should start to get a sense.
In Conclusion…
Complexity makes web work unpredictable and very difficult to budget, but it's also a lot of what makes it fun. Without complexity—without being paid to learn—web work becomes a race to see who can push buttons the fastest and cheapest. If you're a developer and in the industry for the right reasons, that's a race you want to lose.
I hope you've found this exploration of the dark, misty confusion of complexity simple and illuminating! If you have any questions or comments, I'd love to hear them below.
About Christopher Hitchens: The Last Interview
“If someone says I'm doing this out of faith, I say, Why don't
you do it out of conviction?” —CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS
One of his generation's greatest public intellectuals, and perhaps its fiercest,
Christopher Hitchens was a brilliant interview subject. This collection—which
spans from his early prominence as a hero of the Left to his controversial
support for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan toward the end of his life—
showcases Hitch's trademark wit on subjects as diverse as his mistrust of the
media, his love of literature, his dislike of the Clintons, and his condemnation of
all things religious. Beginning with an introduction and tribute from his longtime
friend Stephen Fry, this collection culminates in Hitchens's fearless final
interview with Richard Dawkins, which shows a man as unafraid of death as
he was of everything in life.

SAN DIEGO – Bryan Price wants struggling right-hander Michael Lorenzen to continue to pitch for the Reds through September, but that role has not yet been decided.
Lorenzen didn't make it out of the second inning on Tuesday and has struggled since the All-Star break, going 0-4 with a 12.57 ERA in five starts.
The 23-year-old right-hander has made 17 starts for the Reds this season plus two relief appearances for a total of 90 2/3 innings. He also has 19 innings at Triple-A, for 109 2/3 total. Last season he threw 120 2/3 innings at Double-A Pensacola. Price said he wants Lorenzen to throw somewhere between 150-155 innings this season, but also pitch through September.
“It's a balancing act at this point in time right now. He's got a lot of growth – a lot of room for growth and need for growth,” Price said. “We've asked a lot out of this kid, as you guys know. If you go back over his history, one full season as a starter in professional baseball, this is his second and he's had some really good moments, even though he's in a bit of a downspell right now.”
Lorenzen acknowledged that fatigue may be part of his recent struggles and Price hasn't decided if Lorenzen will make his next scheduled start, Sunday against the Dodgers.
With five rookies in the rotation, innings limits will be the norm for all of the team's starters other than Anthony DeSclafani. DeSclafani threw 162 1/3 innings between the minors, majors and Arizona Fall League last season, so Price is confident in him logging 190 or so innings.
Raisel Iglesias (82 1/3 innings total), David Holmberg (126) and Keyvius Sampson (94 2/3) have all thrown more innings than they did last year, but both Holmberg and Sampson have thrown more innings in the past.
Price said the organization has a plan for all of the starters and their total innings, but didn't want to come out and throw out numbers for any pitcher other than Lorenzen.
“I don't want guys thinking they're near the end or shutting it down, but (Lorenzen is) at such an extreme because he's so limited in professional experience and innings, that you're not going to see him pitch 210,” Price said. “We knew that wasn't going to happen. I don't want to be coy because his situation is right out there. We knew that going into the season.”
Picture of tiger in Tijeras causes Facebook frenzy Copyright by KRQE - All rights reserved Video
TIJERAS, N.M. (KRQE) - An Albuquerque man took a photo of what appears to be a tiger while he was mountain biking near Tijeras.
The photo has gotten a lot of attention online. People have been cracking jokes. Others are worried. The sheriff's office even thought it could start a panic.
"Definitely, a tiger or something. A lion or something with stripes," said Al Radzka.
"Wow, this is potentially scary if it's real," said Kaveh Mowahed.
An Albuquerque artist snapped the picture and posted it on Facebook earlier this week. He claims he thought he saw a tiger by a bike trail near Tijeras.
"Well, tigers aren't really native to this part of town, so I don't know what to think about that," said Phillip. "How did it get here?"
"It just seems so crazy," said Mowahed.
The post got tens of thousands of views and a lot of comments.
One person posted, "Maybe Mike Tyson is on vacation in the canyon."
Another person said, "I don't think I want to go hiking anymore."
News 13 asked around to find out what really was in the picture. We called New Mexico Game and Fish, the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office and Bernalillo County Animal Control.
Turns out, it is a tiger in the picture, but it's a plastic tiger.
According to officials with the Sandia Ranger District in Tijeras, a group of people were doing some cleaning on the mountain years ago when they spotted the statue.
Instead of trashing it, they say they brought it back to the office and put it near a hiking trail.
Officials said they haven't heard any concerns until a picture of the statue wound up on the internet on Wednesday.
Originally, the ranger district said it thought the tiger was stolen from Los Lunas High School because that's the school's mascot. They later found out it wasn't stolen.
Rangers said they threw the tiger away Wednesday afternoon to avoid any more trouble.
The guy who took the tiger picture never got back to News 13.

Rodney Robinson, a single father in Los Angeles, needs government help to pay his rent. But getting that help from the state of California involves sharing the money with some of the nation's largest banks or check cashing services.
The state distributes public assistance through so-called EBT cards, which look and work much like debit cards. But Robinson's neighborhood in South Los Angeles has only three places that allow him to use that card to withdraw enough cash to cover his monthly rent free of charge. He can visit any bank ATM, but that entails charges of as much as four dollars per transaction. A local check cashing chain charges $1.75. Grocery stores will let him withdraw cash, but only after a purchase.
"Those are your options, in this neighborhood anyway," said Robinson, 43, who has resigned himself to surrendering part of his $317-per-month check for lack of other options. "I can either pay the fee, or go buy several packs of gum to get the money and suck up a different kind of waste."
Across much of the nation, administering relief programs such as unemployment benefits and emergency rental assistance has become an increasingly substantial profit center for banks and other financial services firms, according to analysts. Like California, many states have contracted with private companies to distribute these funds. While the contracts have saved states millions of dollars in costs previously incurred for printing and mailing out checks, the agreements often give companies the ability to extract fees from recipients -- some of the nation's most vulnerable families.
"We are talking about people living well below the poverty line, who need every penny to survive," said Diana Spatz, executive director of LIFETIME, a California-based nonprofit that helps poor families qualify for assistance then gain self-sufficiency. Spatz is herself a former welfare recipient.
The average cash grant in California amounts to $458.24, or $5,498.88 a year, and supports a family of three, according to state data. The federal government considers a family of three poor if it's annual income amounts to less than $18,530. California's assistance program typically leaves families living on less than 50 percent of the federal poverty line, and usually with little extra cash.
California's agreement with Affiliated Computer Services, a Dallas-based division of Xerox, to distribute cash welfare assistance, aid for international refugees, utility grants and other emergency support cost the state's poor nearly $17.4 million in surcharges and fees last year, according to California Department of Social Services data. The spoils went to ACS and many of the nation's largest banks.
ACS asserts that it is doing right by state taxpayers and the people who count on it for their disbursements.
"We provide a quality service that helps states save money and gives benefit recipients secure access to cash," said Kenneth Ericson, a company spokesman, from his office in Washington, D.C.
Under the terms of the contract with ACS, California's poor families can request cash back after making purchases at many stores. Four times a month, they can use a network of ATMs owned mostly by credit unions without incurring a charge. After that, ACS assesses an 80 cent fee each time an EBT cardholder visits any ATM. People receiving public assistance can also use the phone or Internet to check their account balances free of charge, but they surrender 25 cents each time they do so at an ATM.
On one of its websites, the state publishes a searchable list of ATMs that benefit recipients may use free of charge. At the county level, social services staff also hand applicants lists of free ATMs available in the local area.
"We really make every effort to ensure that California families have free access to their benefits," said Michael Weston, a spokesman for the California Department of Social Services.
But advocates for the poor say ACS's network of free ATMs is far too limited. Most belong to credit unions or community banks that operate one to three machines -- unlike major banks, which maintain hundreds of cash machines in multiple cities. In most retail stores, customers can only request cash back in multiples of $20, with a maximum withdrawal of $200 per transaction, according to five people receiving cash benefits in California. In many stores, the cash back limits fall around $80.
At the same time, items people most often use their cash benefits to cover -- necessities such as rent, utilities and phone bills -- often run more than $200, which effectively forces many poor people to pay fees and surcharges to access their benefits, say advocates.
"Millions of dollars that California families need for basic necessities, millions intended to help poor people in this state, are instead going to banks and processors in surcharges and fees," said Jessica Bartholow, a legislative advocate at the Sacramento-based non-profit advocacy group, the Western Center On Law and Poverty.
Electronic benefit cards, or EBTs, are a relatively new phenomenon. In 1996, when then President Bill Clinton signed legislation overhauling welfare, a little known provision required that states gradually phase out paper food stamps and instead provide electronic access to food aid. The cards were supposed to cut food stamp printing and mailing costs and help reduce fraud.
Over the next 15 years, states began handing contracts to banks and other companies to manage additional forms of public assistance via the new cards.
For the financial institutions, the change opened a potentially lucrative avenue: While federal law bars retailers, banks and other companies from collecting fees or surcharges for handling food stamp benefits that are loaded onto EBT cards, that provision does not apply to cash assistance programs.
ACS has been in the business of providing access to public benefits for more than 15 years and currently has contracts with 16 states, including Ohio, Massachusetts and Virginia, said Ericson, the company spokesman.
Four years ago, ACS won a contract to provide benefits access to welfare recipients in California through 2015. ACS secured the state's business with a proposal that pledged to save the state an estimated $20 million compared to other bids. JP Morgan Chase had previously provided the same services.
Under the terms of the contract, California pays ACS 60 cents per month to load any type of cash assistance onto an EBT card and $1.17 per month when the company loads both food stamps and cash benefits. In September, some 76,000 families were receiving only cash aid and 623,500 families were receiving both cash and food assistance. As a result, California paid ACS $775,095 for maintaining its EBT system that month.
The number of families receiving assistance fluctuates each month, so it is difficult to say how much the company will earn this year or over the life of the contract for loading benefits. And, ACS's earnings are not reported separately in Xerox's public earnings statements.
But state data does show that ACS collected $806,238 in fees from California's public benefit recipients over the first eight months of this year. And banks collected about $12.9 million in ATM surcharges from many of California's poor families during that same time.
In September 2010, the California Department of Social services sent letters to companies that own and operate large ATM networks such as Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase and Cardtronics, as well as financial industry trade groups, such as the California Banker's Association, the California Credit Union League. The letters asked the banks and the trade group's member institutions to waive surcharges for EBT card users at their ATMs.
None of the banks complied, Weston said.
That doesn't surprise Robinson. The poor aren't a public priority, he said.
"Mention welfare and people usually start talking about fraud, the fraud they think they've seen at the store, people in casinos, the people they think don't deserve benefits," Robinson said. "There's just this assumption that we're all a problem."
In 2010, California's governor directed ACS to block ATMs inside strip clubs and casinos after a Los Angles Times story revealed that welfare recipients had pulled $4.8 million off of EBT cards in casinos over the course of nearly three years, the newspaper reported. In that same period, poor people pulled about $12,000 out of ATMs stationed at strip clubs.
Back in 2006, Robinson was working full time in an airplane parts factory. His commute was 40 miles round trip. The cost of gas was soaring. Robinson's electricity was cut off more than a few times, he said. So, he decided it was time for a big change. He left his job and went back to college. When Robinson got a divorce in 2009, he took a part-time job in the school's business office so that he could also care for his now six-year-old daughter. Welfare is a temporary crutch Robinson used to keep his daughter out of a lifetime of poverty, he said.
But, when California trimmed its welfare eligibility timeline from five years to four this year, Robinson lost his benefits. Now, he is receiving $317 in cash assistance for his daughter and $300 in food stamps to keep her fed. Robinson had to take out additional student loans to get by. There have been times when he's needed help from family or friends. But this spring, he will graduate.
If you are anything like me and have 2 or more monitors set up but don't want to take the fps hit running a triple headset up those extra monitors feel like a waste just sat there doing nothing while you game from just one.
Well here is the solution when flying the gazelle.........
2nd Sceen as Viviane TV camera
What kind of black magic is this I hear you ask........
Well the answer is fairly simple and can be found on the Eagle Dynamics DCS forums.
But to save you several hours of trawling through posts and trial and error I will attempt to help you out here.
This will work for 2 1920 x 1080 monitors of the same size, I have no idea how it will pan out with different resolutions or monitor size as some tweaking may be required.
(A side note on resolution, you will need to check DCS settings to set the required resolution for your 2 monitors if its not in the drop down menu you can enter it manually, you can see the resolution settings for my 2 1920x1080 monitors in the picture at the bottom)
I Suggest you keep copies of all the original files that we are about to replace incase something doesn't work or you just plain fuck it up, as I cant be responsible for human error and what works for me might not work for you.
First head over to your DCS installation folder which should be somewhere like here......
C:\Program Files\Eagle Dynamics\DCS World OpenBeta\Mods\aircraft\SA342\Cockpit\TV\Indicator
In this folder you want to replace the init.lua file with this one...
Now head over to here
C:\Program Files\Eagle Dynamics\DCS World OpenBeta\Config\MonitorSetup
And paste this file in...
When you load up your game and go to settings and in the system tab click on monitors, and then down to Camera + TV.
Like so
Now run a mission with the SA342 and test it out.
Good luck

In his weekly radio/YouTube address, President Obama derided House Republicans' planned lawsuit against him, warning that GOP lawmakers will spend taxpayer dollars on a frivolous legal challenge.
"It's a political stunt that's going to waste months of America's time. And by the way, they're going to pay for it using your hard-earned tax dollars," Obama said.
House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has orchestrated the beginnings of a lawsuit against the president over his use of executive authority.
As the White House and the GOP-controlled House have failed to compromise on a slew of issues during Obama's tenure, the president has repeatedly sought to circumvent political intransigence with unilateral executive action, often accusing Republicans of refusing to compromise. Republicans, in turn, have alleged that Obama is not sincerely interested in working with them and has overreached beyond his authority.
The lawsuit will focus on Obama's massaging of his signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act. Via executive order, Obama delayed the implementation of its requirement that employers provide health insurance to full-time employees, a key provision. Republicans have asserted that action amounted to re-writing a law without a vote from Congress.
Obama has issued executive orders altering U.S. policy on immigration and other issues, but Republicans have chosen to focus solely on health care.
"There are many examples of executive overreach by the president, but his actions on the health care law are the ones that give the House the best chance of success in the courts" states a draft resolution authorizing the lawsuit. The House Rules Committee will meet Wednesday to consider the resolution authorizing the suit that would be brought by the House's Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, which serves as legal representation for the lower chamber. The full House could vote on it as early as Thursday.
Touching on another familiar issue - the lack of cooperation in Washington - the president admonished Congress to pass bills he would sign.
"I have a better idea: do something, Congress. Do anything to help to work Americans. Join the rest of the country. Join me - I'm looking forward to working with you," Obama said.
Republicans, meanwhile, handed their weekly-radio-address duties over to Joni Ernst, one of the party's most prominent 2014 Senate candidates - and one who once mentioned the possibility impeaching Obama.
"The problem in America today is that Washington is full of liberals who think government is the solution to every problem. They think that nothing can be solved unless Washington is involved," Ernst said in the address. "And so they grow our government, every year making it more intrusive and more involved in our lives. Today government tells us what doctors to see, what kinds of light bulbs to use, and in some places, even how much soda we can drink."
Ernst called for a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution and an end to Obamacare.
At a candidate forum in January, Ernst accused Obama of having "become a dictator" and said impeachment should be on the table if, hypothetically, the Supreme Court ruled his "recess appointments" unconstitutional. Responding to a question about what consequences Obama should face if the Supreme Court invalidated his appointments-which it later did, in a June 26 ruling-Ernst responded that "yes, absolutely he has overstepped his bounds" and that "I do think that yes, he should face those repercussions, and whether that's removal from office, whether that's impeachment."
On Tuesday, former Republican vice-presidential nominee and former Alaska governor Sarah Palin called for Obama to be to removed from office, alleging he has intentionally allowed immigrants to enter the country illegally.
In a statement issued through her campaign, Ernst clarified her remark, saying she had responded to a hypothetical question about a Supreme Court ruling and that "To be clear, I have not seen any evidence that the President should be impeached. I obviously do not believe the president is a dictator, but his repeated use of unilateral action sure makes him look like one."
On June 26, the Supreme Court did rule against President Obama in a case challenging three of his "recess appointments."
A lieutenant colonel and battalion commander in the Iowa Army National Guard, Ernst said in the address that she had recorded it early and would be deployed on active duty for two weeks by the time it aired on Saturday.
This post has been corrected. An earlier version misstated that Ernst had made her comment at a candidate forum on Tuesday and that her comment came after Palin's. Ernst made the comment in January, well before Palin's comment drew greater attention to Ernst's comment. The post has been updated with more context about the question and Ernst's response, as well as her subsequent statement disagreeing that President Obama should be impeached.
Mozilla on Friday issued its support for the Federal Communications Commission's proposed net neutrality rules, but a House Republican this week introduced a bill that would block the commission's efforts.
Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee introduced the Real Stimulus Act of 2009, which would prohibit the FCC from "needlessly imposing regulations on the Internet," Blackburn said in a statement.
The congresswoman asserts that the FCC's rules "ironically would make the Internet less neutral by allowing the FCC to regulate it in the same way it regulates radio and television broadcasts."
Specifically, Blackburn's bill says the FCC cannot "propose, promulgate, or issue any regulations regarding the Internet or IP-enabled services." The measure is a companion bill to one introduced last week by Sen. John McCain titled the Internet Freedom Act.
"The Internet is the last truly open public marketplace," Blackburn said. "The FCC has plenty on its plate with the regulation of television and radio; let's not add to their workload by giving them authority over the Internet."
Net neutrality is the theory that everyone should have equal access to the Internet. A major tech company should not be able to pay a provider to load its Web site faster than a mom-and-pop site, for example. Most are in agreement that that should be the case  the discussion at this point is whether the government should step in and regulate net neutrality or if industry should self-regulate.
The FCC proposed official net neutrality rules at its Oct. 22 meeting, and stakeholders have until early next year to submit comments.
In a Friday editorial for the Wall Street Journal, Mozilla executives voiced their support for the FCC's rules.
"As heads of an Internet company competing in today's marketplace, we fully support the FCC's proposal," wrote chair Mitchell Baker and CEO John Lilly. "The fundamental technologies of the Internet have always been open; the FCC's proposed rules would merely preserve that openness."
Baker and Lilly supported the FCC's plans to extend net neutrality rules to the wireless industry. "Nondiscriminatory access to content is what created the miracle of the Internet. It must be preserved," they wrote.
Rep. Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who has penned legislation in favor of net neutrality, also wrote an editorial today for the Huffington Post on the topic.
"If adopted, the Commission's net neutrality protections will ensure that users have unfettered access to all lawful online content and applications," Markey wrote. "These measures, which will be crafted over the coming months by the FCC, are urgently needed to preserve the openness and competition that have made the Internet the most successful communications medium in human history."
Shipping
All items will be shipped within 4-5 business days of receipt of payment unless otherwise stated (my Harry Potter scarves are usually made to order and ship out within 5-6 business days). Business days are Monday-Friday and any order placed after 2pm PST is considered to have been placed on the next business day (for instance, if you purchased an item at 4pm on Monday, it would be considered received on Tuesday morning)/ All items will be shipped via either USPS first class or UPS Ground (depending on the item) and are well packaged to prevent damage (see my refunds and exchanges policy for more details). Insurance and other options are available upon request. I always get a delivery confirmation on all packages shipped so that both my customers and myself have accurate tracking information.
I do not send a printed copy of the invoice with each of my orders because I feel it's more eco-friendly not to, especially since the invoice can be viewed at any time here on Etsy. If you'd like me to include one in your order, let me know and I will happily include one!
I can also gift wrap and send greetings with any of my treasures!
Despite having spent the 2000s turning the generic term "PC" into a pejorative stand-in for "Windows", Apple may be selling the best PC on the market. It just happens to be the one that fits in your pocket.
Our goal at Lifehacker, as stated in the page title, is to cull together "tips and downloads for getting things done". (It was previously a much cooler but presumably less Google-friendly, "Don't live to geek; geek to live.") So why are we talking about smartphone categorization semantics?
Advertisement
Namely because a significant portion of what we've always covered involves using technology to make your work, your play, and your life better, richer, and more productive. For years, that meant focusing on desktop PC operating systems like Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Increasingly, it involves mobile (phone) operating systems like iOS and Android (and sometimes others). The more we've covered them, the more we've realized that your desktop PC and your smartphone really aren't all that different. Except one is a whole lot better at performing personal tasks.
Smartphones Are PCs...
When you strip away the advertising and consider the term "personal computer", you're left with a pretty broad term that easily applies to today's currently huge smartphone market (including iPhones, Android phones, webOS devices, BlackBerrys, Windows Phones 7, and so on.) Wikipedia's article on the personal computer defines the PC as "any general-purpose computer whose size, capabilities, and original sales price make it useful for individuals, and which is intended to be operated directly by an end user with no intervening computer operator." (Ignore the woefully outdated section on Pocket PCs.) Point is, smartphones easily meet the generic requirement for being classified as PCs.
Advertisement
...only they're more personal...
There's not much room for interpretation on what "computer" means. The tautologous answer is "anything that computes", though we can stick with Wikipedia's more specific definition of a computer as "a programmable machine that receives input, stores and manipulates data, and provides output in a useful format".
On the other hand, if we focus on the whole "personal" aspect of the PC, there's certainly more room for interpretation. And from a computing perspective, what's more personal than a gadget that:
...comes with you wherever you go
...knows where you are
...is always connected to the internet
...handles every form of electronic communication short of Morse code (oh wait)
...recognizes your voice and reacts accordingly
...doesn't just spellcheck, but corrects your typos
And so on.
Your smartphone's like HAL; your desktop's Deep Blue. (Don't look too far into that analogy—I'm sure it'll break down—but you get the point.)
Advertisement
...and do nearly everything better...
While desktop or laptop PCs are capable of performing most of the tasks mentioned in the list above in one way or another, most often than not they're not default features, and more importantly, today's smartphones do them better.
It's always with you: You've heard the saying, "The best camera is the one you have with you"? The same is true for PCs, and in this case, it's your smartphone. (Ignore for a moment the fact that your smartphone is often the camera you've got with you, too.) Most of us don't have the physical endurance to lug a laptop around everywhere we go, and even if we did, pulling it out every time you want to check your email is a pain most of us aren't willing to endure.
Advertisement
It knows where you are: Even better, when you pull out your smartphone to start using it, it quickly identifies where you are and uses that information to inform nearly everything it does for you. (I've also used both iPhone and Android as dash-mounted GPS devices and have never been disappointed.)
It's a great communicator: One of the most personal things we do is communicate, and your smartphone, surprise, is a great communicator. Voice, text, pictures, video—it spans media and medium in a way your desktop never has.
It listens to you: Most smartphone OSes come with at least some form of voice recognition, and it'll only get better. Android phones are currently at the top of this heap, allowing you to use your voice to fill in any text input on your device, search the internet, navigate to anywhere, play music, etc. I've tried really hard in the past to use voice recognition on my desktop and have always been a little disappointed.

Reader Mitchell Swirski articulates the "personal" aspects of his smartphone: "It can help me find deals when shopping, remember parking, find restaurants, calculate the tip at said restaurants, read reviews for movies before I rent them, give me directions to different places, and give me direct access to my email and means of communication at all times. If I am waiting for someone to email me something important, I am no longer constrained to the computer."
In fact, if we're considering the "personal" part of "personal computer" to apply more to those things above than to—I don't know—filling out spreadsheets, smartphones perform most PC tasks better than your desktop PC. And compared to the relatively stagnant desktop market, the smartphone market is overflowing with great ideas—both in theory and execution. (Small tweaks to desktop operating systems aside, when's the last time you remember your desktop taking a significant leap toward doing something truly innovative or life-changing?)
...except for a few things
It would be crazy not to admit that desktop computers do some things better, and there are some things you still can't do on smartphones.
Advertisement
Namely, right now desktop PCs are better for work. They're better for typing. They're better for manipulating large data sets and for heavy computation (like video editing, data crunching, image editing). They're better at multitasking. They're better at creation.
But that's all changing. You can, for example, connect a Bluetooth keyboard to a lot of different smartphones, so when it comes to simple word processing, these small devices can work really well. (For what it's worth, though, some smartphone's software keyboards are really good. I think I can type on an iPhone keyboard nearly as quickly as on my desktop.)
Yes, you can also criticize smartphones (in the same way the iPad is criticized) for being consumption devices rather than creative devices. Leaving aside the fact that I now semi-regularly draw on my iPad (versus never anywhere else), it's not a criticism without warrant. And creation is a big part of what makes PCs great. But I wouldn't count out your smartphone's creative capacity just yet.
Advertisement
The thing is, smartphones get better at all of this with every OS release and every new hardware iteration. Almost everything that desktop systems do better will, in time, improve on your smartphone. You'll be able to handle serious computational tasks, if only via the cloud. (This already happens, but will happen to a greater degree.) You'll be able to plug it into a monitor or project onto a wall and get the screen real estate and (potentially) the multi-window environment you need.
I'm not saying that the desktop PC is dead (proclamations that institutions are dead are far too common in the technology sphere). But from a personal computer standpoint, your smartphone is doing things your desktop only wishes it could do. (Or, you know, things you wish your desktop would do.)
This whole train of thought may seem apropos of nothing (as someone who writes on the internet, you learn that it's important to peg your thoughts on news if you want anyone to care—this isn't one of those articles), but the smartphone I carry around in my pocket is the best PC I've ever used, and I suspect I'm not alone. Here's to continuing to hack away at it and make it even better.

Agree? Absolutely disagree? Somewhere in the middle? Let's hear it in the comments.
A Crude LENR Hypothesis
The Commitment of Traders Report reveals interesting data.
For two years now, Sifferkoll has been following the energy markets in relation to a possible LENR (cold fusion) technological breakthrough. The basic idea is that, if there is an information advantage, the big banks will acquire it and use it to make as much money as possible. If such actions can be shown, it is in itself good indications of a proven breakthrough.
And there is money to be made. Not yet from the new technology, but from a plunging energy market (oil, coal, natural gas, etc.). The Commitment of Traders reports (CoT) published weekly by CFTC (U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission) has been analysed. This report shows the actions and positions of the different market participants in the crude oil futures market. It reveals some interesting data.
Fig 1, Crude oil futures; price, CoT (standard & disaggregated report). Please click to enlarge.
At some point during the fall of 2010 there was a large policy shift in hedging crude oil on the NYMEX futures exchange by the big banks and the oil companies. Up to that point the hedgers of crude have largely been the producers as they want to hedge their production against future price movements. On the buy side there was the big financial institutions (Swap Dealers = JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, etc), and the money managers (large pension funds, hedge funds, etc.), that speculate in a price increase.
But during the fall of 2010 this state of affairs changed. From being net-long 200 thousand contracts, the banks became net-short in a couple of months. Their selling has since continued. And now, by March 2013, they are net-short 300 thousand contracts (300 million barrels of oil = $30 billion). See the green lines in the chart above.
At the same time the producers have liquidated their 200 thousand contract short position (blue line above). They are no longer hedging as they used to. And they've done it in a very consistent way. It looks almost unreal, buying an equal amount of contracts each month for two years.

During this time the banks have consistently been using a strategy to buy weakness and sell strength during their massive net-selling. As if their strategy was to build a huge short position and at the same time stabilize price. The conclusion is that the banks are now net-short about 300 thousand contracts at a price about $90-$95.
On the buy side the money managers went from being neutral by fall of 2010 to being net-long 250 thousand contracts as of today. This is of course the big funds, and in the end pensions and savings. They are now net-long oil and of course net-long all the producers (oil stocks).
Researching this strategy change has given very little information. One article though, from July 2012, touches on the subject. No answers and no explanations though. Insidefutures.com
Following the Commitments of Traders Report (CoT) does however reveal a great deal of information. The standard report shows the commercial traders, (oil companies and banks), large speculators (big funds) and smaller speculators (the rest). The disaggregated report also shows the position of banks and producers respectively. Both these reports are shown in the graph above. The combination does tell us that something is going on, but what?
Something real is going on, but what?
Why are the producers abandoning their decade long hedging strategy? Why are the banks selling oil like crazy and at the same time actively acting to stabilize the market, probably in the range $80-$100? What information do the big banks and big oil use to make these decisions? Is this information readily available?
Hypothetically: What if the first customer of Rossi actually is the US Navy? What if the US Navy know for sure that the 1MW E-cat works (because they have bought several)? What if they actually knew this even before the first public demo of the E-Cat in January 2011? Since the test was decided upon sometime during the fall of 2010 and Rossi himself says he had run a heater in a Bologna factory during a year before that, it looks reasonable. So let's assume that this is the case.
It is certainly in the big banks interest to know about these things, and they do have the resources to find out, and keep quiet about it. It is also well known that US entities like SPAWAR and NASA have researched LENR for some time. There are documents that show that they acknowledge the technology and have done so for some time. However, so far, not on the industrial scale of the 1 MW E-cat.
Since US entities acknowledge LENR, they did what was needed to verify the E-cat when they heard about it. Because even if they thought the E-cat was a scam, they could not afford to not check on it. Even a minute chance that Rossi was on to something would cover the expense and risk. The money involved are simply too big for a miss like that.
Also, if US military entities know, then the big banks know, and at least the producers where the big banks have big interests know. Anyhow, they certainly know by now if the first customer is the US Navy, as Rossi (almost) says, and nobody denies.
The thirty billion dollar question is how to make as much money as possible from this information.
First they probably thought that the E-Cat demo could get the price of oil to drop already in the beginning of 2011. They certainly are prepared for it by February 2011, as the aggregated net-short position of big banks and producers was in excess of 300 thousand contracts already at that time. But the price went up, since media did not catch on and other issues (like the war in Libya) were much more important for the oil market at the moment.
When the plunge didn't happen a new strategy evolved. The producers then started to liquidate their short positions in a very consistent way. This short position has been taken over by the banks probably in cooperation and as a risk reducing strategy, although not as consistently, since they've been trading against the market most of the time, buying weakness, selling strength.
Related article: Renewable Energy Companies to Keep an Eye On
By the time of the 1MW demo they probably had Rossi more under control as they simply became the first and only customer for all the 1 MW E-Cats he could produce during the coming 18 months. They played the game the way Rossi wanted it (as his goal is mainly to sell the E-Cats he produces). And since very few people take Rossi seriously there was no problem keeping the news out of media and off the Internet (except for some dedicated sparsely visited sites).
So. What if the banks know about LENR and they are preparing for the oil price to plunge. It would make some kind of sense looking at their actions. It's reasonable to expect that when the possibilities of LENR becomes widely known by the public, that will be the case. It might drop by 80%, or to the production costs of the easy access reserves. New explorations will be abandoned, shale oil & gas, deepwater oil and oil sands will be abandoned, other green technologies, like biofuels, solar and wind, will also be abandoned, etc. The long term growth potential of the oil industry will vanish in a day. Actually, we already see signs of this development as several large oil fields are up for sale or already sold. There is a widespread divestment strategy among big oil (Shell, BP 1, BP 2, Exxon, ConocoPhillips, etc.)
If this happens oil stocks will plunge as well, since their stock price reflects many years of potential growth and huge profits, which will evaporate within 10 years. The hedge that they used to have, will then be of limited use, since the stocks will fall for other reasons anyway. The strategy is probably to let the banks profit from the price movements directly instead. The managements of big oil are probably an important part of the deal, since they will, of course, benefit personally. But the oil business, as the most profitable business in the world, will be history. Big oil will simply merge with big banks in the form of big cash, but only after the oil stocks have crashed.
Meanwhile the strategy of the banks is to sell oil and oil stocks to the money managers as much as possible while keeping the price in the desired price range of $80-$100. They will keep doing this until the news of almost free green and unlimited energy reaches the public. This can happen within a couple of months with a good third party test or any other serious breakthrough in LENR area, or it can take much longer. The banks will buy as much time as they can by keep satisfying Rossi with discrete orders and inducing doubt in media, while increasing their net-short positions. The longer it takes, the better for the banks. They already have the information advantage.
Looking at the forecasts from the big banks it's obvious that they produce forecasts in the $90-$100 range for the coming year(s). The problem they have is one, to defend the low price of oil in this peak-oil-era and secondly to avoid price hikes which will result in huge paper losses on their books, from their short positions. They seem to do this by pushing information on new developments of shale, deepwater oil and Canadian oil sands to anchor the price at about $90, and at the same time induce hope in new abundant resources (Reuters, Financial Times, FoxBusiness). There are, however, several reports stating that the costs are too high and the volumes way too low for these new resources (Zerohedge). It's a delicate balance act.
The real reason for the relatively low range bound price of crude for the last two years, is simply huge short selling and anti-trend trading by the big financial institutions (JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, etc.). The reasons for this might be a political agenda executed by these ”swap dealers” to keep the price in a certain range for macroeconomic growth reasons, or maybe, which is the hypothesis of this report, they know something that is not yet publicly accepted. LENR might already be a technological fact on the industrial scale, and not further away in time than the banks can manage to keep it secret. This makes a huge difference on the outcome. Maybe this is exactly what they know. It certainly would not be surprising if they have verified the E-Cat and actively trade on that information. The information advantage is huge and so are the potential profits.

The status war has finally broken out in earnest over the Syrian refugees. The first shot was fired by the glamorous blonde Icelandic blogger who offered to adopt a Syrian child and encouraged her countrymen to let out their spare rooms to the refugees. Around 10,000 Icelanders have responded positively to her Facebook campaign and her picture has been seen around the world as a result. Here's a video of Dutch welcoming refugees with song.
Then the Finnish Prime Minister weighed in with an offer to let out his second house and got plaudits all around for this selfless demonstration. Again the Finns rallied around and the offers have been pouring in.
But now the big rollers have arrived. Sir Bob Geldof says he will put three Syrian families in his rambling country house in Kent and put another one in his London place. The publicity avalanche generated by this has been predictably huge.
It was very generous of Saint Bob but only fair as the humanitarianism business has been so good to him. Back in 1985 Bob's pop music career had long fizzled out when he had the bright idea of a record and concert for African famine relief, the big cause at the time.
His business partner remembered that when they first dreamed it up in a greasy spoon café, Bob was so broke he couldn't pay for his bacon sandwich. Today Geldof is one of the wealthiest men in the British media — thanks to Live Aid. He really did show that you can do well by doing good.
All of which now piles the pressure on Oscar-winning actress Emma Thompson. Last week she was enjoying herself hugely chastising her fellow British as “racist” and “shameful” for being reluctant to take in refugees. Now Britain has decided to take in tens of thousands — time to throw open the doors of that huge Hampstead mansion, Emma!
Strangely there is much more enthusiasm for accusing others of racism and shameful behaviour than there is for actually opening up their own houses.
For what the crisis is highlighting is the strength of one of strongest but least acknowledged forces of the age. WEMI — or Western Emotional Incontinence — is a form of narcissism common to prosperous Western countries in which deranged and self-destructive fits of empathy seem to overtake the middle class — and especially the gentle sex.
While not a root cause, WEMI is a massive accelerant to what is happening now. Like atomic fission, WEMI could be harnessed for good causes or wielded for bad ones. Unfortunately our ruling elites seem to know this very well.
It took a commenter on the Steve Sailer blog to put his finger on it and he used the iconic photograph of the dead Kurdish child on the beach.
In Germany, which is being held up as the greatest country in Europe, upwards of 40% of women with advanced degrees have no children. The drowned child was their child, their family is the family of the world. Hence as a result of that photo the prime minister of Finland has announced that he will place his second home at the disposal of Syrian refugees.
Is it too uncharitable to suggest that, amongst left-wing women in particular, this is not fuelled by altruism so much as a combination of attention-seeking, status-enhancement and hatred? Hatred of White men whom they blame for their unhappiness? Hatred of working class White men who, in Britain, are constantly demonized as workshy, benefit-addicted degenerates?
Some men's rights activists have theorized that a matriarchal society makes women unhappy and they will attempt to open the gates to new, more virile, men as replacements. Perhaps this is cuckoldry on a societal level.
To remember a time when society lost its collective mind in this way British people only have to cast their minds back to the death of Princess Diana when the entire nation's womenfolk seemed to take leave of their senses. The queues of female mourners, wanting to pay their respects, stretched for miles outside her London home.
Amongst Jews especially there seems little taste for opening their own homes to Muslim immigrants. They don't like being told what to do. But they seem to have an endless appetite for shaming, nagging, lecturing, preaching and barking out orders about the moral shortcomings of the British while hypocritically ignoring Israel's response to the crisis. There can be little doubt that the Jewish community favors very generous policies toward refugees.
One reason for this is that Jews tend to see the situation in terms of the Jewish experience as refugees during World War II rather than from the point of view of the present interests of the UK and its people. That non-Jewish countries should be open to refugees is widely, if not universally, seen as a basic Jewish interest. Deep in the Jewish psyche is the memory of the voyage of the St. Louis in May, 1939 in which Jewish refugees from Europe were not admitted to Cuba and the U.S. did nothing because of pervasive anti-immigration attitudes at the time.
Failed politician David Miliband chided the British public that they were “betraying their proud history of helping the displaced” — a plea heavily larded with the lachrymose tale of his own family's wartime struggle to get into Britain. (Miliband now makes a handsome living running a humanitarian aid NGO in New York as consolation for not becoming the Labour leader.)
The Independent was one of the outlets willing to air the hysterical observation from Andrew Stroehlein, media director of Human Rights Watch, that the ghost of the Holocaust was summoned up because the police in Czechoslovakia were numbering the refugees on their arms with pen and ink. Stroehlein's Twitter feed seems spew out shaming and blaming accusations around the clock.
The Guardian gave Jonathan Sachs space to rehearse the well-worn Kindertransport story while the paper's Diplomatic Editor Julian Borger recited the tale of his own family's wartime flight from Vienna to Britain, the argument being that if his family was ambitious and talented, all refugees must be similarly endowed and similarly motivated (“Refugees bring hope, not trouble – my father's story is proof of that“).
And speaking of Kindertransport and the tendency to see the situation as a Jewish allegory, this is from the Jerusalem Post:
With all the questions about how Europe should deal with the Syrian refugee crisis hitting its shores, one Holocaust refugee says that the Syrian refugees should be welcomed in wholeheartedly as he was 77 years ago. Leslie Baruch Brent, a professor emeritus in immunology, was just a child when his parents sent him to live at a Jewish orphanage in Berlin to escape the unbearable anti-Semitism in the small German town where they lived. … “We [meaning the British] owe this to mankind to help the unfortunate people who are desperate and whose plight we are to some extent to blame for,” he said in reference to the Iraq War, which he claimed lead to the creation of Islamic State. … So far, Brent described the British treatment of the refugee situation as “horrendously negative and selfish” and criticized the way Europe as a whole has handled the situation. “Europe has a responsibility to help refugees,” he said. Germany's recent welcoming of Syrian refugees into their country was described by Brent as a shining example of how other countries should handle the situation. Now with a desperate situation facing refugees fleeing the civil war in Syria, Brent says Europe has a duty to let in the refugees.
In the Guardian, Jonathan Freedland led the finger-wagging by telling us that we must resolve to “do better.” Nevertheless, his heart is warmed by housing projects in Sheffield and London that will prioritise refugees over the natives in overcrowded Britain.
On the BBC, Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis was interviewed by Political Editor — and fellow Jew — Laura Kuenssberg. They agreed that White countries must do much more share the wealth with the Muslims. Mirvis discussed the crisis with Pope Francis who has very generously agreed to accept two (2) refugee families at Vatican parishes.
The Pope said: ‘We all share this world together, therefore we need to care for this world together. We need to recognise that the plight of the refugees is not only their problem, it's also our problem, these are real people.That's why the first thought that crossed my mind when I saw the picture was, God forbid, it could have been a child of mine, a child of yours, anybody's child.
But for sheer gall it is difficult to beat Jewish journalist Ronald Brabazon from the Salzburger Nachrichten newspaper in Austria. Rather than making a Julian Borger-type claim based on the success of his own family, he claimed that immigration was proven to produce economic success because of the success of 750,000 Russian refugees who arrived in Israel. Of course, he omitted to say that these were Jews arriving in a Jewish society.
What everyone was too polite to mention was that Israel was taking in no refugees at all. The country is too small, says Netanyahu (although it wasn't too small to admit the aforesaid 750,000 Jewish refugees). And in any case they are busy exporting their African “infiltrators” to Sweden and building a wall to keep Syrian refugees out.
It's not just Israel's behavior that is getting no coverage. What is not being asked is one of the most amazing aspects of the story so far — astonishing given the saturation-coverage. Everywhere you looked, the refugee narrative fell apart. Many of the Syrian refugees are not Syrian and aren't even refugees. There is the disconnect between the pictures of the strapping, healthy looking young men and rhetoric about traumatized women and children who are nowhere to be seen.
The iconic picture of the dead child on the beach? The Kurdish parents were not in a war zone and had been living in a safe area for three years before their reckless decision to take to sea. But this is hardly mentioned apart from obscure reports like this one entitled “We are being taken for fools.”
And then there is the selective amnesia about the elderly Italian couple who had their throats slit by two Black refugees after arriving by boat from Libya. And how two asylum seekers were arrested after a mother and her son were stabbed to death in IKEA of all places.
And has it not struck you how well televised and photographed an event it is. Even the arrival of migrants to a rapturous applause in Germany seemed to be choreographed. The refugees even managed to co-ordinate chants for the benefit of the cameras? In several languages? Has it not struck you how slick this all is?
Will we discover that this is about as “spontaneous” as the colour revolutions that spread across Eastern Europe and turned out to be largely organised by Western security sources and such selfless individuals as George Soros?
Perhaps people were not asking difficult questions because they are too intoxicated with their own self-righteousness. They are too busy feeling good about themselves — and chastising others.

As Darrell Issa tries to bring down Obama again today, Obama's actual, real record is speaking volumes on its own, and it's not saying scandal or failure. It's saying resounding success.
On this Republican black Thursday, we've gotten news that stocks hit record highs and ObamaCare is cutting costs by more than 50% for individuals who are buying their own insurance. Not a good day to be a Republican.
Things are so bad for Republicans that Carl Quintanilla of CNBC tweeted, “At this moment, stocks are up 110% during @BarackObama's tenure — closing in on Reagan's 118%. (via Rich Peterson, S&P)”. Rich Peterson is the Director, Global Markets Intelligence, S&P Capital IQ.
At this moment, stocks are up 110% during @BarackObama's tenure — closing in on Reagan's 118%. (via Rich Peterson, S&P) — Carl Quintanilla (@carlquintanilla) July 18, 2013
Conservatives: Et tu, Ronnie?
Obama is the closest thing to Reagan this country has seen since before Reagan, given that much of Reagan is a myth. However, conservatives worship St. Ronnie allegedly because of the above. And yet, Obama agrees with Reagan and not the current GOP on Social Security and now here we have Obama inching to taking out Ronald Reagan's stock surging record. OMG. Prepare for end times.
Why are those stocks soaring? Oh, you know, a fluke. Or, as CNN put it, “Investors pushed the Dow and S&P 500 to new trading highs Thursday, as they welcomed a batch of strong earnings and a drop in jobless claims.”
The Dow Jones industrial average gained more than 100 points, or 0.7%, while the S&P 500 also rose 0.7%, to an all-time high.
Yes, that's right. The Obama economy is at it again. Buoyant stocks, drops in jobless claims – and all of this without the help of Republicans. All of this, actually, in spite of Republicans the best efforts to bring down the country as punishment for electing the Democrat.
It was just seven days ago that the Obama economy shattered records with a huge budget surplus in June. So what we have here is a Democratic president whose economic and financial record is that of a fiscally responsible President, what some might label a “fiscal conservative”, only a real one- one who pays for programs he enacts and doesn't just borrow like a drunken frat boy from the taxpayers — not a stingy, greedy, selfish, irresponsible “fiscal conservative”.
See, when you're careful with your money, and you pay for things instead of playing shell games with “credit” and “debt” you pretend doesn't exist, that same sense of responsibility not only allows but informs compassionate policies.
Obama knows when to use our gains for the betterment of those more vulnerable than us. Obama knows that we have a moral responsibility to care for the vulnerable in society and that when we look out after one another, we are a stronger and better country. When we try to live up to our promises to our veterans and our children and care for our elderly, we are a better country. Not only because that's democracy, but because that is what a truly successful country looks like.
And this is why Republicans only want to talk about the fictional monster under their beds instead of the real record of the actual President. Benghazi! IRS! This is why Darrell Issa is wasting taxpayer money again today, trying to scare up an anti-Obama drama from the dusty confines of his single basket of goodies.

If you're ready to read more from the unbossed and unbought Politicus team, sign up for our newsletter here! Email address: Leave this field empty if you're human:
Winnipeg's infrastructure deficit is extreme. It is currently sitting at $7 billion which works out to more than $10,000 for every single Winnipegger or nearly $30,000 per Winnipeg household. This is, in part, a consequence of sprawl.
Winnipeggers will have to pay for this somehow. And the younger you are now, the more likely it is you're going to be around when the city finally has to collect. Winnipeggers will also have to come up with a long-term strategy for preventing the deficit from growing. Property taxes either have to go way up or we have to find a way to curb sprawl.
It's well known that the personal automobile drives sprawl. Facing massive infrastructure deficits, cities across North America are investing in public transit in order to curb the constant pressure to build outward.
In order to be effective, transit investment in Winnipeg must be used to tip the balance between cars and buses and make taking a bus more convenient than taking a car. But cars have some significant advantages that have to be overcome.
Transfers and Walking Distance
Good transit policy seeks to reduce the time-consuming element of bus riding. Anyone who's ever taken a bus knows that transfers and walking to the bus stop are the most time consuming elements of public transit system.
The plan we advocate for, investing in hundreds of new buses, will lead to greater frequency on all routes, including the all-important feeder routes. By preserving the existing system, bus stops will continue to be approximately 300-400 meters apart (like they are on Pembina Highway) and with buses coming more often, those bus stops along feeder routes that are close to people's houses will become significantly more useful.
More buses will also significantly improve transfer time. Transferring between buses can easily add 10 or more minutes to a trip. When a rider needs to connect to another route, it often makes for a much more stressful trip. If the connecting bus comes every 20 minutes, it really sucks to miss that bus. This is another problem that frequent buses solves. When a bus comes every five minutes, missing the one you intended to catch is not nearly as frustrating. Frequent bus service works as a kind of reliability.
The Southwest Corridor does not solve the walking and transfer problems.
Walking distances are actually made worse. On the existing Rapid Transit line bus stops are 1.2 kilometers apart, that's three or four times further apart than the existing system. For anyone that doesn't live in the developments that are supposed to eventually surround bus stops, walking to the BRT line will be quite a bit more inconvenient. The greater distances to stops will easily eat up the five to eight minute time savings predicted by the corridor. And what about the winter? Does the city have a snow clearing plan for all these additional sidewalks that riders will have to walk?
And for those using feeder routes, they are still stuck with the transfer problem. When arriving at a BRT stop from a feeder route a transit rider will probably be able to transfer quickly (because BRT buses come frequently), but when transferring from BRT to a feeder route, a rider is stuck waiting for an infrequent bus once again.
Frequent buses solve much more effectively the true time-consuming elements of riding transit: walking distance and transfer time. Better yet, for the same amount of money, frequent buses can be implemented everywhere in the city..
Roy Moore defeated Alabama Sen. Luther Strange in Tuesday's Alabama Republican Senate primary runoff.
With 82 percent of precincts reporting, Moore received 55.8 percent of the vote, while Strange received 44.2 percent, according to The New York Times.
The primary took on national importance as President Trump endorsed Strange, while traditional Trump allies, such as former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, backed Moore.
“They're going to say, ‘Donald Trump, the President of the United States, was unable to pull his candidate across the line. It is a terrible, terrible moment for Trump,'” the president said while imitating news anchors at a Friday rally in Alabama in support of Strange.
Strange become a senator when Jeff Sessions left his seat to become attorney general. The senator is a former lobbyist and was backed by a super PAC linked to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and the Chamber of Commerce, a typical establishment GOP partner.
“Mitch McConnell and this permanent political class is the most corrupt and incompetent group of individuals in this country. They think you're a pack of morons. They think you're nothing but rubes,” Bannon said at a rally Monday in support of Moore. “They have no interest at all in what you have to say, what you have to think or what you want to do.”
However, Trump contended at his Friday rally in support of Strange that the senator barely knew McConnell, and that Strange is “determined to drain that swamp.”
The president would go on to say, “I'll be honest, I might have made a mistake,” and said he would campaign “like hell” for Moore if he were to win the primary. The former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice led the race throughout in the polls, and was up by 11 points in the final public poll.
Moore is a major figure in Alabama and became nationally known in 2003 when he was removed from office after defying a federal court's ruling to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the Alabama state Supreme Court building.
Like Trump, the former judge has a brash, and sometimes offensive manner of speaking.
“Now we have blacks and whites fighting, reds and yellows fighting, Democrats and Republicans fighting, men and women fighting. What's going to unite us? What's going to bring us back together? A president? A Congress? No. It's going to be God,” Moore said in a campaign speech.
Moore also presented himself as an anti-establishment, anti-free trade, and anti-immigration candidate, even though he didn't know what the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) amnesty program was in a radio interview.
Trump chose to back Strange over Moore and Rep. Mo Brooks in early August before the runoff election. Steve Bannon privately blamed presidential son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner for the endorsement, according to a Republican Alabama political operative.
A White House official, however, denied that Kushner ever discussed an endorsement with the president.
Moore's victory nonetheless is already being spun as being a positive for Trump.
“Judge Moore is an American hero who will be a tremendous asset to the President in the Senate. So tonight is actually a yuge victory for President Trump,” Sam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign aide, told The Daily Caller.
The general election for the Alabama Senate race is on December 12 and Moore will face-off against Democrat Doug Jones. Alabama has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1992.
Kings second-year guard Ray McCallum has shined during the season's final two months in his first two campaigns.
In April of last season, RayMac averaged a career-high 12.6 points and 6.6 assists per game. While this season, No. 3 is averaging a season-high 10.5 points and 4.6 assists per game in March.
The offensive stats, however, do not tell the complete story.
On Wednesday in Phoenix, McCallum's infectious defense on Eric Bledsoe and P.J. Tucker helped fuel the Kings to their fourth consecutive win and second this season in Phoenix - the first time Sacramento has won both games in Phoenix since the 1998-99 season.
The Kings saw seven players score in double-figures, led by DeMarcus Cousins (21 points, 11 rebounds and three assists) and Rudy Gay (14 points and five assists).
The Kings have scored 100-plus points in 11 of the last 12 games.
Cousins recorded his 43rd double-double of the season.
Nik Stauskas shined off the bench, tallying 13 points and four rebounds on 5-of-7 from the field.
shined off the bench, tallying 13 points and four rebounds on 5-of-7 from the field. P.J. Tucker was held to 1-of-11 from the field.
Andre Miller dished seven assists in 18 minutes off of the bench.
Playing Playoff Spoilers
With the win, the Kings kept Phoenix three games back in the loss column to Oklahoma City - who lost on Wednesday by 39 points to the San Antonio Spurs - and currently holds the eighth playoff spot in the Western Conference.

Ammon and Ryan Bundy, leaders of an armed militia group that took over a national wildlife refuge in Oregon earlier this year, were acquitted Thursday of federal conspiracy and gun charges relating to the 41-day standoff with federal authorities. The Bundys were among the 26 charged for their participation in the standoff at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge and the pair never disputed that they commandeered the refuge and established armed patrols.
The Bundys, the sons of anti-government, Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, claimed the takeover was an act of civil disobedience against what they broadly consider government overreach in its administration of vast swaths of public lands in the western U.S. Dozens of armed anti-government militia-types joined the Bundys holed up on the refuge, while federal authorities largely allowed events to play out in an effort to avoid bloodshed. The Bundys were arrested three-and-a-half weeks into the takeover during a traffic stop where one militia member was killed.
“Federal prosecutors took two weeks to present their case, finishing with a display of more than 30 guns seized after the standoff,” the Associated Press reports. “An FBI agent testified that 16,636 live rounds and nearly 1,700 spent casings were found.” In the end, however, federal prosecutors were not able to show that the Bundys were explicitly “conspiring to impede federal workers from their jobs,” which is the foundation of the conspiracy charge.
Seven other members of the militia are scheduled to go to trial in February and 11 others have already pleaded guilty.
It is one week until Halloween (eeee!) and it's time for my third round of spooky book recommendations for your Halloween TBR! Does this mean I'm done recommending spooky books forever? Of course not! I love spooky books and I am always reading them, which means I'm always collecting more to recommend! But for now, this will wrap up my list of recs for the 2017 Halloween season.
Can't read your whole Halloween TBR by Halloween? Great news! Unlike Halloween candy, spooky books never go bad and are great all year round. At least according to me.
Disappearance at Devil's Rock by Paul Tremblay
Disappearance at Devil's Rock was my most recent read by Paul Tremblay (whose writing I am very quickly and very steadily falling more and more in love with), and if you want to know a lot about what I think of it, I have a full review here for your reading pleasure. But if you want the quick rundown, here it is: this book, about the disappearance of fourteen-year-old Tommy, blends psychological thriller/mystery with the supernatural in a subtle but super freaky way that will have you wondering what you should be more afraid of: ghosts and the possibly paranormal, or the horrible things humans do to each other. This book seriously had me a little freaked out, and I was flip-flopping back and forth between thinking something supernatural was happening or thinking that it was just the stress of the situation making the family think they were seeing things. I highly, highly recommend this book. It's perfect to read in the dark and will send a chill down your spine.
Heart-Shaped Box by Joe Hill
What an underrated read by Joe Hill! I know I have recommended a couple of other books by Joe Hill on my other lists, but seriously, can we all just agree that he and everyone in his family are just insanely talented, especially in the realm of spookiness? I don't see people talking about Heart-Shaped Box much anymore, so if you haven't read it yet, you should! This book takes it back to a straightforward stock favorite: ghosts. Freaky, scary, vengeful ghosts. In this case, a ghost presumably attached to a dead man's suit that the main character purchases online, which leads to a freaky running-away-from-a-terrifying-ghost road trip, and isn't that the best kind of road trip?!
Oh, wait…I mean, no. No, it isn't. But it will keep you in suspense and there is a good chance you will not be able to guess what is around the corner in this novel by the author of Horns and 20th Century Ghosts.
Survive the Night by Danielle Vega
Survive the Night was the first book I read by Danielle Vega and it was the book that made me a huge fan of hers, because it honestly kind of freaked me out, and it really made me think. In this YA horror novel from the author The Merciless series (which y'all know I adore), Casey and her friends go to an underground rave where things go disgustingly, horribly wrong when attendees start getting gruesomely murdered and then Casey and her friends find themselves trapped beneath the city in the abandoned subway tunnels running away from…something. This book is a little gross, a little trippy, and a lot spooky! One of my favorite things about this book is that throughout, I found myself wondering if this really was all happening, and if this was a literal monster the characters were facing down, or if it was a bad trip from the drugs they were taking, or if it was all a lengthy metaphor for running from our own demons.
Either way, it's awesome, and possibly Vega's best work, in my opinion. Which is saying a lot when you know how much I love The Merciless. I'm going to make a lofty statement here: If you only pick one book from this list to read, pick this one.
My Best Friend's Exorcism by Grady Hendrix
I'll admit it—I didn't like My Best Friend's Exorcism as much as I liked the first book I read by Grady Hendrix, which was Horrorstor. But My Best Friend's Exorcism sucked me in with its kitschy, hardcore 80's vibes and a slightly different take on the often played out exorcism trope. In this horror novel, Abby's best friend Gretchen goes missing during a slumber party, and when she finally emerges from the woods, she is acting extremely strange. Her possession grows and strengthens through the course of the novel, and the evil manifests itself in some really interesting ways as she turns on her friends and loved ones. At the end of the day, the only person prepared to face the evil head on and try to save her is Gretchen's best friend, Abby. This may not have been one of my favorite reads of all time (and you can read my full review and all my thoughts on it here), but for a Halloween TBR, this book is a great fit, will keep you guessing, and does have some pretty freaky/gross moments.
Dracula by Bram Stoker
You know I like to include one classic on each of these lists, and Dracula is one of those books that I really think every horror fan should read at least once, if only so you can really get a look at the roots and at the lineage of this genre. Dracula is the granddaddy of vampire books. Without this, there is no Vampire Chronicles, no Vampire Academy, no Twilight. We are looking at the ancestry here, folks. In case you live under a rock (or haven't seen the movie), Dracula follows Jonathan Harker as he visits Count Dracula's infamous castle in Transylvania and things escalate so quickly.
Harker sees the spooky count himself turn into a bat, he is visited by three mysterious women in the night, he wakes up with wounds on his neck—you know, standard vampire stuff.
But even after Harker manages to make out safely, the horror of the Dracula's Castle follows him, and things explode into full scale vampire madness.
If you are a horror fan, or a vampire fan, or a classic literature fan, trust me, you will want to give this one a go.
Okay, y'all, that does it for my spooky book recommendations for Spoopy Season '17! Have you read any of these books? What's on your Halloween TBR? Let me know in the comments! You know I'd love to talk. <3
Saskatchewan was not part of Canada in 1867. In fact, the future province was not even a Canadian province at the time. That would quickly change.
Incorporating the northwest was a planned feature of the 1867 Confederation deal (section 146 of the BNA Act).
By acquiring the region, expansionists expected the young dominion to become stronger, more powerful, but most of all, more secure on a continent dominated by an aggressive United States. The western interior had to be claimed by Canada as soon as possible to keep the Americans at bay.
Two years after Confederation, Canada struck a deal with the Hudson's Bay Company to surrender its charter rights to Rupert's Land (present-day western and northern Canada) for £300,000.
It was a phenomenal real estate transaction.
The original dominion not only increased seven times in size, but the land transfer paved the way for agricultural settlement of the western plains.
It would be several decades, though, before the expected rush of homesteaders was realized.
These Indigenous children faced new circumstances and challenges with Canadian acquisition of the northwest. (Louis Cochin)
Indigenous peoples, in the meantime, faced new circumstances and challenges. Indeed, change was a defining feature of life in the western interior.
In the north, the lives of Indigenous people largely revolved around a steady, somewhat unimaginative, fur trade. But new rivals would soon compete with the HBC, while the trade became more concentrated in the region because of growing settlement in the south.
Life on the line| Are fur trappers stuck in the past or a vital piece of Canada's living heritage?
On the plains, bison were in steep decline. Two-thirds of the herds, once numbering from five to six million animals, were effectively gone by the mid-19th century.
As Methodist missionary George McDougall gloomily summed up the situation: "A time of starvation. No buffalo."
Cree bands moved to protect their hunting territories.
No longer was the Saskatchewan country a bison common, open to all, but increasingly claimed by particular bands. By the 1860s, though, bison were mostly found around Wood Mountain, the Cypress Hills, and present-day northern Montana and the Poplar and Milk rivers.
The Cree, Assiniboine, and Saulteaux responded by forming large hunting parties that entered enemy Blackfoot territory in force. The Métis, heavily involved in the bison robe trade, also pursued the depleted herds by establishing small wintering settlements throughout present-day southern Saskatchewan.
They were anxious times, made worse by another smallpox epidemic that spread north from the Missouri country, first to the Blackfoot and then the Cree. The death toll ranged from fifteen to forty percent.
Because the disease never reached beyond the Touchwood Hills and the Qu'Appelle Lakes, the epidemic was largely unknown to the outside world.
So too was one of the largest battles in plains warfare. In October 1870, the Cree launched a major attack against the Blackfoot near the junction of the Belly (Oldman) and St. Mary rivers (near present-day Lethbridge).
But the Cree were flung back and lost hundreds of warriors.
The once great bison herds were in steep decline by the 1860s. (Adrian Paton)
The "buffalo wars" ended when the Cree and Blackfoot reached a peace agreement in the spring of 1871. The fighting had a terrible cost, made worse when the smallpox dead were added to the tally.
It is easy to understand why the Cree and Blackfoot felt under siege at the time.
Nor did the coming of peace alleviate the suffering. There was widespread starvation in the wake of the smallpox epidemic. William Christie at Fort Edmonton reported that the Cree who wintered on the plains in search of bison "suffered frightfully" and reduced to eating their horses.
The Cree along the North Saskatchewan came together in 1870-71 to discuss their plight— and the unsettling news that Canada had bought their lands from the Hudson's Bay Company. Newcomers meant more competition for the dwindling bison.
Sweetgrass, the leading chief in the Pitt district, sent a message asking for a treaty.
Our country is no longer able to support us. - Sweetgrass
"Our country is no longer able to support us," he reported.
"We invite you to come and see us and speak to us."
The Cree sought farming assistance as part of a new, long-lasting, reciprocal arrangement with the dominion of Canada.
But no one came.
Whereas Ottawa was preparing the land for settlement and the railroad, it had no immediate plans for treaties west of the new province of Manitoba. And so the Cree refused to allow any government-sponsored activity in their territory until Ottawa finally agreed to deal with them.
Getting the Canadian government to meet with the Cree was an accomplishment in itself.
First Nations and Métis peoples were not consulted, let alone represented, when the Canadian government negotiated the purchase of Rupert's Land in 1869. Nor was Ottawa prepared to give the western population a meaningful voice in the settlement and development of the region.
The Northwest Territories was treated as little more than a federal colony into the 20th century.
And even when Saskatchewan became a province in 1905, it had to wait another quarter century before it was granted control over its public lands and resources.
It is little wonder, then, why the Saskatchewan story of confederation is a protracted, at times acrimonious, experience.
Asian Championship 2018/European Championship 2018 Announcement
Announced by Linus Frész on
Dear community,
We are happy and proud to inform you that:
European Championship 2018 will be held in Madrid, Spain in July 2018.
Asian Championship 2018 will be held in Taipei, Taiwan in July/August 2018.
Bratislava and Madrid had applied for Euro 2018. Both teams delivered a plan which included details about the city, the venue, the dates, the organisation team and the budget. After that the selection team had chats with the teams, to get a clearer picture of the applications. Additional details were sent in by both teams in the month of September. After collecting all the information a voting was done in the selection team. Madrid won with 3 votes, Bratislava had 2 votes.
The Bratislava team was praised for having the best worked out application ever, with all details on a very high quality level. Still the innovative concept of the Madrid team won the votes of three selection team members.
The applications of Madrid and Bratislava can be found here:
Madrid 2018 website: http://madrid2018.cubecomps.com/
Bratislava 2018 pdf document (budget part removed): https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_ENPYv470xQQkVBRldhc0NBV0k
Taiwan was the only country that applied for Asia 2018, therefore the main goal of the selection team was to make sure that the Taiwan team could work towards a successful Asian Championship 2018. The initial plan of Taiwan did not have the required depth, therefore the Taiwan team had two weeks extra to come with further details. In this period the team was able to deliver the required details and to secure support of delegates from neighboring countries. The selection team now believes that Taiwan is ready to organise Asia 2018 successfully.
The application of Taiwan can be found here:

We thank all the applying teams for the time and energy they put into the applications. It is good if WCA can choose between different applications, although of course it is a bit sad to say no to the teams that were not chosen, despite their hard work.
We are looking forward to two great continental championships in July/August 2018!
Cubic regards,

It's midnight and I've got a headache. I didn't eat any solids today bar an accidental slice of apple my housemate gave me at 10am. I had forgotten that I was only eating between the hours of 12pm and 8pm. I divided my batch into four shakes, but was only able to consume three of them. It was too filling. I think I should have eased into this and experimented with one drastic change to my diet rather than two. So as of tomorrow, no more intermittent fasting. At least until I figure out what's causing these headaches.
Based off what I've read, the likely culprit is the Potassium Gluconate. I can't help but agree with this as this ingredient had not arrived while I was trialling DIY Soylent last week. So I'm going to halve the amount tomorrow and see how I go.
Another negative side effect would be the fucking shits I'm getting. I wouldn't say I've got the runs, but it's not exactly solid either. More like tiny poolets exploding out my ass, propelled by high pressure flatulence.
I also need to drink more water. This could be contributing to my headache. I definitely will add more water to my batches to dilute the taste of salt that makes the drink almost unbearable. Last week I actually enjoyed the drink, but that was because I added no salt at all.
Other than that, my day was fine. Had energy for my gym session, and everything else functioned as it should.

SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- Twenty-nine people in Onondaga County died of opioid drug overdoses during the first three months of 2017, nearly three times more than previously estimated.
Opioids include heroin, fentanyl and prescription drugs like oxycodone.
The Onondaga County Health Department published the revised number on its website Monday.
In April the county's preliminary estimate showed 10 opioid deaths for the first quarter. There were 34 reported opioid deaths for the same three-month period of 2016.
Health Department officials said preliminary quarterly data does not accurately reflect the number of overdoses in the community. That's because autopsies conducted by the county Medical Examiner's Office in many overdose cases are not completed during the same quarter the deaths occur.
Toxicology testing to identify drugs taken by overdose victims is the most time-consuming part of drug-related death investigations, according to Dr. Robert Stoppacher, Onondaga County's chief medical examiner.
Multiple samples must be tested to identify a large number of possible drugs, he said. New synthetic opioids such as Fentanyl can be difficult to detect.
Drug deaths investigated by the county Medical Examiner's Office increased 50 percent in 2016.
Because of the backlog of cases, the health department said it will not report overdose death numbers for the first six months of the year until October.
Of the 29 first-quarter deaths, 12 involved fentanyl, nine involved both heroin and fentanyl, four involved heroin and four involved other opioids.

When Randall Stephenson, AT&T's chief executive, spoke about the state of the wireless industry at a conference this week, he shared some surprisingly frank comments about the iPhone. In particular, he said that he wished the company had never offered an unlimited data plan for the device and that he loses sleep over free texting services like Apple's iMessage.
If AT&T hadn't offered unlimited data, it would have been able to get people who used more data to pay up for it, as opposed to having the light data users subsidize the heavy ones, he said.

“My only regret was how we introduced pricing in the beginning, because how did we introduce pricing? Thirty dollars and you get all you can eat,” he said in the on-stage interview at the Milken Institute's Global Conference on Wednesday. “And it's a variable cost model. Every additional megabyte you use in this network, I have to invest capital.”
AT&T discontinued unlimited data in 2010, and it has since moved to limited, tiered data plans. The switch is working out well for AT&T. In the last quarter, the company reported $6.1 billion in revenue from mobile data alone. Ralph de la Vega, chief executive of AT&T Mobility, said 70 percent of the people on tiered data plans were paying for the more expensive options.
But that's not the end of AT&T's concerns. Mr. Stephenson said he worried about services that could replace the company's own offerings. For example, free Internet-based messaging services like Apple's iMessage are eating into the company's revenue from text messages.
“You lie awake at night worrying about what is that which will disrupt your business model,” he said. “Apple iMessage is a classic example. If you're using iMessage, you're not using one of our messaging services, right? That's disruptive to our messaging revenue stream.”
A recent analysis of the mobile industry showed steep declines in text messaging in several countries. In the United States, text messaging is still growing but more slowly than before. Some analysts expect texting revenue to shrink for American carriers this year.
Mr. Stephenson added that Skype, the Internet-based phone service, was becoming a more viable voice service as data networks improved, which also poses a threat.
But over all, Mr. Stephenson said he didn't regret the decision to support the smartphone, which pushed the phone industry into a data-driven model. Earlier in the interview, he reflected on the initial discussions with Steve Jobs on whether Cingular Wireless, which eventually became AT&T, would support the iPhone.
Mr. Stephenson was chairman of Cingular's board at the time, and he said Mr. Jobs had met with Stan Sigman, who was chief executive of Cingular. After the meeting, Mr. Sigman approached the board to talk about a “unique opportunity.” He hadn't even seen a picture of the iPhone, but he described a device with a touchscreen that one would use to make calls, do e-mail and run apps.
The board was nervous about the Apple smartphone because it was aware that it would transform its business model, Mr. Stephenson said.
“I remember asking the question: Are we investing in a business model, are we investing in a product or are we investing in Steve Jobs?” Mr. Stephenson said. “The answer to the question was, you're investing in Steve Jobs. Let's go after this thing. And we went after it, and the rest is history.”
The implications of choosing a serverless architecture are large and varied. Therefore, the content of this book should appeal to a broad range of people interested in architecture, design, development, deployment, testing, and maintenance of systems.
If you're already a fan of microservices (versus monolith or n-tier) systems, this book will provide you with ammunition to lobby for their increased adoption amongst your peers and coworkers, along with plenty of practical advice and concrete examples to help you figure out what you're doing.
While my primary recurring example is of a greenfield application that has been designed from the start with this approach, you should find the information herein to also apply to decomposition of existing, monolithic or dysfunctional systems as well. There are also plenty of real-life examples including case studies.
While there are a handful of viable technologies that may be used to achieve a serverless architecture, this book focuses on Amazon Web Services. In my opinion, their revolutionary Lambda product is the world's first viable attempt to provide infinitely scalable computation-on-demand. In their words, it gives you the ability to run code, not servers.
Guide to Readers
This book has four main parts. I've done my best to make sure it will be a delight to read straight through chapter by chapter. At the same time, the book is apportioned into major parts that I hope will make it useful as a reference companion.
The first part entitled The Story encompasses Chapters 1 thru 5 and is an introduction to the main concepts and technology involved in building serverless applications using microservices with Amazon Web Services.
The second part called The Case Study is the story of our case study and source of example code, a tech startup called FoodButton. Throughout the book, we have made an effort to relate the story of our case study in vivid detail, including context for the architectural decisions. We feel that the best way to learn about how to design applications is by understanding the context of the decisions made while building and evolving actual systems.
The third part is The Patterns and it is where we list out the patterns that we find relevant to the building and integrating of microservices. Some of the patterns are quite large in scope, especially the ones pertaining to architectural styles.
The Services provide a high-level reference guide to the AWS products most relevant to serverless microservices design. This part does not go in-depth because we understand more than anyone else that the best place to get that information is online.”

By By Kev Hedges Nov 8, 2010 in Science The Large Hadron Collider has created its very own mini Big Bang after smashing together lead ions instead of protons. These unique conditions were achieved yesterday by scientists working at the world's largest atom smasher on the French-Swiss border. Large Hadron Collider (LHC) runs underneath the French-Swiss border in a circular loop some 17 miles-long Juhanson Up until now, the LHC has been smashing protons in a bid to uncover the formation of the universe. These proton collisions could help find the The LHC is expected to find the Higgs boson particle, or confirm its non-existence. Higgs boson is often referred to in the media as the God Particle. Over the next month scientists will study the data carefully from this ion collision. This will help to find out more about the plasma the Universe was made of a millionth of a second after the Big Bang, some 13.7 billion-years ago. These collisions obtained were able to generate the highest temperatures and densities ever produced in an experiment. David Evans, a researcher from the University of Birmingham, UK, is working on ALICE, the machine at the LHC that collides the ions together. He explained: This process took place in a safe, controlled environment, generating incredibly hot and dense sub-atomic fireballs with temperatures of over ten trillion degrees, a million times hotter than the centre of the Sun. At these temperatures even protons and neutrons, which make up the nuclei of atoms, melt resulting in a hot dense soup of quarks and gluons known as a quark-gluon plasma. Put more simply quarks and gluons make up the building blocks of matter, they are sub-atomic particles. In the state known as quark-gluon plasma, they are freed of their attraction to one another. This plasma is believed to have existed just after the Big Bang. Scientists can then look forward to what happens next in an experiment that could discover what happens to these particles during those moments just after the big bang. Last year, it was reported in ALICE: This machine collides ions at the Large Hadron Collider Stefan A. Gärtner The LHC is smashing together particles in an effort to unlock the secrets of formation of our Universe. The collider, housed underneath the border is circular and 17 miles-long (27km).

Several high-level Democrats, including ex-DNC head Donna Brazile, confirmed that President Trump and Infowars were right about how Hillary Clinton stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders, which in itself confirms an Infowars prediction that Democrats would soon sacrifice Clinton.
In Aug. 2016, then-candidate Trump echoed an emergency message from Alex Jones warning that Clinton would try to steal the presidency just as she had stolen the Democratic nomination from Bernie Sanders.
“I think it was rigged against Bernie Sanders with his superdelegates nonsense,” Trump said.
Only a few days before, Jones asked Trump to make an issue out of it.
“Crooked Hillary Clinton has openly stolen the nomination from Bernie Sanders,” Jones said on July 30, 2016. “Mr. Trump, I'm not going to lay things out that you already know, but I am going to ask you to seriously think about making the issue of Hillary's election fraud in the [Democratic] primaries one of the central issues to defeating her in November.”
Throughout the 2016 campaign, Infowars documented Clinton's takeover of the Democratic Party and the outright theft of the nomination from Sanders, including this gem of a video from Feb. 2016 in which a Democratic superdelegate told Infowars reporter Richard Reeves how Hillary would be crowned regardless of Bernie's surging support:
And a few weeks earlier, Infowars reported on how Clinton “won” the Iowa primary BEFORE votes were counted.
Similarly, Clinton gained two more delegates than Sanders in the New Hamshire primary, even though Sanders won more votes.
And in March 2016, we revealed how a half-dozen Democratic superdelegates ignored the results of the New York primary in support of Hillary.
Infowars also reported on an interview of a Bernie delegate at the DNC who revealed that the party was replacing Sander supporters with paid seat fillers to create fake “unity” behind Hillary Clinton.
Additionally, Infowars documented how the mainstream reporters were holding up signs in support of Hillary at the DNC, which explains their previous anti-Bernie bias.
Combining evidence from the DNC email leak with on-site interviews, Infowars revealed that the Democratic nomination was a facade because Hillary Clinton was pre-selected from the very beginning and that Bernie voters meant nothing to the Clinton-controlled party which willfully ignored the will of the people.
“When we talk about a rigged system, it's also important to understand how the Democratic convention works,” Sanders said in May 2016. “We have won 45 percent of pledged delegates, but we have only earned 7 percent of superdelegates, so in other words, the way the system works is you have establishment candidates who win virtually all of the superdelegates.”
As Infowars reported Thursday, Brazile revealed three key points on how the Clinton campaign controlled the party BEFORE Hillary was chosen as the nominee, how the DNC shafted the more popular candidate Bernie Sanders and how the Clinton campaign robbed Democratic state parties by funneling money to her campaign headquarters in Brooklyn.
Since then, CNN's Wolf Blitzer, once Clinton's greatest ally in the media, said it was “shocking” that Clinton rigged the nomination.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) also agreed that the nomination was rigged against Sanders.
Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries! Lets go FBI & Justice Dept. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 3, 2017
This confirms the Infowars prediction on Oct. 24 that the Democrats would soon sacrifice the self-serving Clinton crime duo.

Our Story
Fresh City is a city farm. We incubate farmers that change lives by farming the city for a living. Heading into our third growing season we are confident that our model is scalable. We want to expand our member farmer program so that each neighborhood has a farm and a farmer. We are confident that we can have 100 farmers growing 1,000,000 pounds of produce in Toronto within the next two years. But we need your help.
Why City Farming?
Food lies beyond reason. Empires of fast food chains and supermarkets are built on that fact. We often eat not what is healthiest for us, our neighbors or our planet, but rather what is packaged attractively, seems cheap, tastes good or is convenient to find.
With most of us living in urban areas, city farming is uniquely positioned to change how people view food -- and in the process take on the processed food marketing machine. City farming helps re-connect us with how good food is grown. It changes hearts not by unfurling the latest findings in a nutritional science journal, but by the taste of a tomato, the touch of calloused hand and the smell of a basil plant. It reclaims land for food production and reduces our environmental impact. By bringing makers and eaters together, we help people -- and ourselves -- glimpse a different world.
Our Model
Our approach is entrepreneurial. We are creating the infrastructure and foundation of making a living by farming the city. Why? So that meeting a city farmer at a dinner party will one day be commonplace. Fresh City member farmers each receive a starter plot at our home base and many also have other plots around the city in yards and other underused spaces. Member farmers get access to greenhouse space, cold storage, tools and a market through the Fresh City box program and farmers markets. Above all, member farmers are part of a supportive community that celebrates on the good days and consoles on the bad days. In our inaugural season, we had 6 member farmers, which grew to over a dozen in 2012 and now two dozen for 2013. We want to lay the groundwork for 100 member farmers by the 2015 season.
Our Impact
Farming organically in the city means less chemicals and less energy used. That means cleaner rivers, lakes, oceans, soil and air. It means less carbon emissions and more biodiversity. It also means thousands of people fed some of the freshest and tastiest produce this side of a backyard garden. Perhaps our most powerful impacts are the visceral food experiences we facilitate for our broader community. Be it by hosting school groups for tours, leading small business volunteer work days, mentoring at-risk youth interns, speaking at various events or just sharing our story with farmers market patrons, we are bringing people closer to good food.
Your Help
Farming sustainably in the twenty-first century is not for the weak of heart or mind. A little leg up from you can go a long way to a beginner city farmer. This will help us create infrastructure for present and future member farmers to succeed, including:
(1) better cold storage (reduces waste and allows for continuous harvest)
(2) irrigation (especially important in this unpredictable climate)
(3) shared tools (particularly high-cost tools such as rototillers)
(4) farmers market van
(5) passively heated greenhouse space for seedlings
The more we are able to raise, the better platform we can create for member farmers to succeed. About half of the funds will go directly to member farmers to help in purchasing seed and soil amendments.
President Barack Obama was in Laos Wednesday, not only to increase our national debt by $90M to help clean up bombs left over from Vietnam, but also apparently to bash American citizens.
Obama told the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI), “If you're in the United States, sometimes you can feel lazy and think, ‘We're so big, we don't have to really know anything about other people.”
And he didn't hold back after that statement.
As he continued his speech, praising Laotians for their fast growing economy we could learn from, he called Americans lazy a second time in reference to climate change.
So clearly, our nation's president who is supposed to be the strongest fighter for our citizens, thinks we are all unenergetic and naïve to other cultures.
But Americans weren't idle in criticizing the president's remarks.
Social media was booming with remarks from Americans, some even suggesting Obama need not return to the states.
Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway tweeted a response.
Tell single mom w/ 2 jobs & no health ins.
Obama: Americans Too ‘Lazy' to Know Anything About the Rest of the World https://t.co/lKrfi23vDg — Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) September 7, 2016
And conservative commentator Glenn Beck also commented on the fact that Obama has been sipping on coconuts in between his lambasting of American citizens.
Obama Sips from Coconut in Laos, Calls Americans ‘Lazy' https://t.co/XAWeDkuloP pic.twitter.com/wfC1W7aXkh — Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) September 8, 2016
Columnist Ben Shapiro returned that attack to the president in a tweet, calling him an elitist who “thinks anyone who disagrees with him is a rube from the sticks, not a principled American capable of thinking differently about risk assessment,” a view point he calls, “truly lazy.”
Maybe Mr.President needs to take a look in the mirror in between golf games and vacations and ask himself, who is truly the lazy one?
Now approaching the last months of his presidency, President Obama and others are beginning to talk seriously about his legacy. In 2008, he set out to transform America. He has indeed been a transformational president. He has transformed the American presidency into an autocracy, the federal government into an oligarchy, and the American public into an anarchy composed of self-seeking tribes, each of whom views its success in terms of defeating its enemies.
This last feat is the most worrisome, and could become the most permanent. The United States of America is an experiment in the history of the human race. It is held together, not by a common race, or a common religion, or a common ethnic culture, as are the most other nation states. In that sense, the USA is not a natural union. What holds us all together is a common language, which informs us of a common history, and, most of all, a common idea. That idea is best expressed by the Declaration of Independence;
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
Sociologists divide society into multiple groups, called sub-cultures or “tribes”. A tribe is a social group consisting of people who have the same beliefs, customs, language, and governance. The term, “tribe”, also denotes a pre-state grouping, smaller and more personal than a state. Americans have always shared with other nations a certain tribalization based usually on ethnicity (race, language, national origin), sectarianism (churches), geography (e.g. North versus South), or occupation (e.g. unions). Most Americans belong to more than one tribe.
What held all these tribes together in America was a realization that certain tribal dictates might have to bow to the common good — willingly or unwillingly — in order to share the individual freedoms all cherish. This understanding is summed up in the statements like “America is a nation of laws, not men;” and “Everyone is equal under the law”. This umbrella and those who adhere to it could be called the “American Super-tribe”.
This underlying consensus has always been fragile, and never truly universal, as in the case of slavery, and various outbreaks of violence and protest, such as Hoovervilles, race riots, union wars, and other incidents in American history which required the use of military force to restore peace.
Today, that consensus has been lost by many of America's tribes. Increasingly, each tribe defines itself by fighting another tribe, such as Black Lives Matter against the police. We are thus not “Americans” but black versus white, poor versus rich, young versus old, Hispanic versus Anglos, minority versus majority, immigrants versus natives, etc. The new morality dictates that each individual accept whatever moral stance the group advocates to the exclusion of all other positions, thus rendering meaningful dialog nearly impossible. Morality is then a product of tribal loyalty rather than any rational process or logic which transcends the group and allows compromises with other tribes. Today, the very existence of the historical “American Super Tribe” is threatened.
For this, we have President Obama to thank. The strategy which he used to get elected president twice was precisely the use of demographic data to pinpoint the tribes which could be expected to respond favorably to the “us versus them” appeal of a black man. This “divide and conquer” strategy, of course, would never have worked if there had been no basis in reality for the approach. What the Obama campaign did was to exploit very effectively these latent tribal complaints by bringing them into the public discourse and by blaming their lack of resolution on the traditional American tribes, namely Republicans, conservatives, while people, and large corporations.
The Obama people successfully used this strategy first in order to get elected, and then in order to govern. Each of the tribes was rewarded by the Obama government, some by the expansion of welfare (e.g. Obamacare), some by lucrative government contracts (e.g. Solyndra, Inc.), some by new laws and regulations (e.g. gay marriage), and others by official recognition (e.g. Black Lives Matter).
It should not have been expected that self-proclaimed victims of over two centuries of racial injustice would show the same reverence for the Constitution and institutions that Americans had come to expect from their president. After all, this is the same system under which their ancestors were persecuted. And so it was. With the aid of a Democratic Senate and an extremely aggressive Attorney General, President Obama became a truly transformational president, as noted above. He has been the “Great Divider”.
This situation has been significantly affected by two factors. First is the mass media. Any message can be promulgated instantly and universally today. Secondly, pop culture has focused increasingly on past injustices and hypocrisies which have always coexisted with the calls for law and order, but have generally remained unremarked until recently. These messages have undermined the prestige of our institutions to a disastrous extent.
A case in point: As it has become increasingly known that many of the Founding Fathers of the United States of America were not only idealists but simultaneously slaveholders, their legacy in the Declaration of Independence (by slaveholder Thomas Jefferson), the Bill of Rights (by slaveholder James Madison), and the Constitution itself (championed by slaveholder George Washington) has been diminished to the point of oblivion for many contemporary Americans, particularly black and Native American populations. The standard call of conservatives for interpreting the Constitution as “the Founders intended” becomes threatening in the minds of these groups. When the Constitution is sidelined, the entire legal structure of the United States is called into question.
These assaults on the values which have been central to the idea of America, while not initiated by the Obama tribes, have been skillfully exploited by them for the purpose of gaining and retaining power. It is not necessary to attribute malicious motives to the Obama Left in spite of their cynical manipulation of their constituencies. They are undoubtedly sincere in their uses of power to achieve a socialist USA.
It is not their motivation that is dangerous; rather it is their success. Hillary Clinton is attempting to use the same divide and conquer strategy — and for the same goals — as Mr. Obama (though so far not as successfully). If allowed to stand for another four years by her election, especially if she is able to pack the Supreme Court, the great experiment that has been the United States of America for the past 240 years will be replaced by the Socialist Republic of America. That will be the definitive legacy of Barack Obama.

BHOPAL: First the lecturers and professors, then the students. Teachers in the Sarojini Naidu College here in the Madhya Pradesh capital have been instructed not to wear jeans, T-shirts or salwar-kameez suits during their duty hours. A circular has been pinned on the college notice board that forbids women teachers from wearing anything else other than sarees.“Yes, it is now compulsory for us to wear sarees to work,” a professor in the college said on grounds of anonymity. “But the trouble didn't start with us. This imposition has been made on us because the next step would be to ban jeans for students.”To discipline students into wearing proper clothes, teachers have been made the initial targets. If women teachers have to drape a saree every morning, male teachers will also have to change their attire to a more formal pair of trousers and proper shirts. Sources in the college said that male teachers had been instructed not to wear anything casual including T-shirts, jeans and sports clothes.According to the professor, the administration is peeved not with teachers but more with students. ``This is a girls college and our students have started wearing low-waist jeans with spaghetti strap tops. When they sit, the jeans go even lower. It may be fashioned for young girls to wear these clothes. However, for the faculty including some male professors, it becomes distasteful to see our students have little respect for teachers and the college, our source explained.“In Bhopal, college teaching staff generally do not wear casual clothes to work. Women teachers don't wear jeans. They wear salwar-kameez which will no longer be permitted in Sarojini Naidu College.”Speaking to reporters, Deepika Niroliya president of the college Public Participation Committee explained: “Some of the teachers had started wearing casual clothes to college. Wearing salwar-kameez, teachers looked so young that it was difficult to distinguish between students and the faculty. A dress code signifies discipline. From the next semester, students will be made to follow a dress code.”
Bitcoin Flies Past New All-Time High of $4K Across Global Exchanges
The price of bitcoin has climbed to another all-time high of $4,000 per BTC across global exchanges on August 12 at approximately 9:40 pm EDT. It was just seven days ago when bitcoin's price surpassed the $3,000 zone gaining $1,000 in value in just one week.

Bitcoin Gains $1000 in Value Over the Course of One Week
Last week news.Bitcoin.com reported on how bitcoin crossed the $3K price range just five days after the network split. Now a week later the decentralized currency has continued to rise relentlessly and now commands a weighted average of $4140 per BTC at the time of writing. Most of the current demand for bitcoin is stemming from the U.S., Japan, China, South Korea and India, but the cryptocurrency is growing more popular in nearly every country worldwide according to Google Trends. Local Bitcoins volumes are also soaring in every nation state recorded by Coin Dance data.
At this price, bitcoin's entire market capitalization is roughly $66B and dominates 47 percent of the entire $134B cryptocurrency market cap. Further, since our last price analysis, BTC trade volume has increased from $1.7B to $2.3B over the past 24-hours. The $4K bitcoin price also follows in line with Goldman Sachs recent BTC prediction two months ago. Goldman Sachs chief technician, Sheba Jafari said at the time;
[Bitcoin] has a minimum target that goes out to 3,212. There's potential to extend as far as 3,915. It just might take time to get there.
Brace Yourselves, Pictures of Bitcoin Price Tickers and the ‘Roller Coaster Guy' Are Coming
Bitcoin's value has gained $1000 per BTC over the course of the last week, and it wasn't so long ago when the price surpassed $2K back in May. At the time bitcoin's average 24-hour trade volume was roughly $1B, and since then volumes have doubled worldwide. Moreover, when bitcoin's price reached the $2K milestone the network hashrate was 4.2 exahash per second, and now miners are processing at 6.1 exahash per second. Mining revenue is also doing quite well reaching its highest point in history, making mining a very profitable business in 2017.
Of course, cryptocurrency enthusiasts are very pleased with bitcoin's price performance. Social media and forums are littered with pictures of people's price tickers at $4K with plenty of funny ‘roller coaster guy' memes as well. There have been some individuals who feel like these rises are no big deal anymore and new all-time highs are just like any other day in bitcoin-land. One forum post nonchalantly says, “Meh — Getting boring, wake me up when we're at $10k please.”
Where do you see the price going from here? Let us know in the comments below.

A novel that began life as an online fan fiction series on a jihadist blog site has jumped straight to the top of the New York Times Best Seller list in its first week of release.
CaliFatal Attraction, described as a “contemporary erotic ISIS romance thriller”, was originally published episodically under the pen name ‘Holy Phwoar' and featured “steamy trysts” between renowned jihadi figures including ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and al-Qaeda frontman Ayman Al-Zawahiri. One chapter even went back in time, fictionalizing a possible romantic liaison between Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.
But when the series' popularity started to soar last year, publishers Random House swooped in to offer its author Penny D. Francis a deal, believed to run into seven figures, to rewrite the story as a three-book trilogy.
“As soon as we read the first chapter, in which a young, muscular al-Baghdadi begins to explore his sexuality while serving as a Mujahedeen militant in Iraq, we knew we had a certifiable hit on our hands,” said Random House CEO Markus Dohle.
Film studios are now said to be in a desperate bid to obtain the film rights for CaliFatal Attraction, with the novel's success thought to make any adaptation a sure fire box-office smash. Mark Strong has already been targeted as a possible al-Baghdadi, described in the book as possessing a “chiseled jawline and eyes that burn wildly with fanatical lust”.
Antoine Griezmann could be heading for France this summer (Picture:Getty)
Chelsea could be set to miss out on the signing of Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann after Paris Saint-Germain reportedly opened the bidding for the French forward.
The 24-year-old scored 22 goals in 37 La Liga apperaances during his debut season with Diego Simeone's side last season and has been linked with a move to Stamford Bridge this summer.
The French striker has a £43.5m release clause in his contract that allows clubs to purchase Griezmann at any point but Jose Mourinho's side are unwilling to pay that much for the former Real Sociedad man.
However, Laurent Blanc's side appear to have stolen a march on the Blues by bidding £28m for the forward, according to reports.

Jeremy Corbyn tonight tried to move on from an apparent split with a shadow cabinet colleague over the role of British troops in a Nato mission in Estonia.
Corbyn spoke to Nia Griffith today in what was described as a “friendly” meeting while his aides rubbished suggestions that she had considered stepping down as shadow defence secretary.
The apparent row was triggered after Corbyn's spokesman was reported as saying the leader had concerns the Nato deployment – which includes hundreds of British service men and women – could contribute to an “escalation of tensions” in Estonia, which represents the border of Nato members with Russia.
A spokesperson for the leader said: “Jeremy had a friendly and constructive meeting with Nia today.”
It came towards the end of a difficult week for Corbyn in which he appeared to backpedal over proposals for a “maximum earnings limit” in the aftermath of a series of broadcast appearances to mark his “re-launch” on Tuesday morning.
Tonight people close to Corbyn suggested the situation with Griffith had been inflamed by inaccurate media reports and that there had never been any question of the Llanelli MP quitting the shadow cabinet.
“The concern had been about what was reported to have been said, not what was actually said. They will continue to work together to develop Labour's defence policy.”
Griffith was described as being angry over the comments by Corbyn's spokesman on Wednesday.
Earlier today Corbyn told BBC Wales he wanted to see a calming in the friction between Estonia and Russia saying: “I want to see a de-militarisation of the border between them. I'm sure everybody wants that, we don't want to see increased tensions”.
NATO reveals plan for deploying 4,000 troops on Russia's borders
By Bill Van Auken
30 October 2015
Plans to deploy some 4,000 NATO combat troops in countries bordering Russia were reported Thursday amid escalating tensions between Washington and Moscow over conflicting US and Russian military interventions in Syria.
The deployment would represent a qualitative escalation of the US-led alliance's encirclement and military buildup against Russia, heightening the threat of both war in Europe and a military clash between the world's two largest nuclear powers.
Adding to the provocative character of the proposed deployment, the troops, drawn from various NATO countries, would be placed under formal NATO command, an arrangement that is put in place in the event of a NATO war against a common enemy. Such a command structure is virtually unprecedented in peacetime.

One proposal under discussion within the alliance would place troops in battalion strength—from 800 to 1,000—in Poland and the former Soviet Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. A less extensive plan would restrict the deployment to a single battalion for the region.
Washington is pushing for the more extensive deployment, according to the Wall Street Journal, while “German officials in particular have expressed reservations, telling the allies in private discussions that they don't want to treat Moscow as a permanent enemy or lock it out of Europe...”
According to the Journal, others in the US-led alliance, presumably including Washington itself, are arguing that “a small buildup could have the unintended consequence of making a conflict with Russia more likely if mishaps or miscalculations by Mr. Putin accidentally trigger a wider clash. To avoid that, advocates say NATO should increase other deterrence efforts, such as demonstrating its ability to move even bigger numbers of troops quickly with exercises like one currently under way in Spain and Portugal.”
The plans for permanent troop deployments on Russia's borders have emerged in the midst of Operation Trident Juncture, the largest NATO military exercise since 2002, involving 36,000 troops, more than 140 warplanes, more than 60 ships and seven submarines.
With the launching of the second phase of the exercise last week, NATO's Deputy Secretary-General Alexander Vershbow, who is the US ambassador to the alliance, made clear that the war games were directed at intimidating Russia.
“We are very concerned about the Russian military build-up,” said Vershbow, who was US ambassador to Russia under the George W. Bush administration. He told reporters, “The increasing concentration of forces in Kaliningrad, the Black Sea and, now, in the eastern Mediterranean does pose some additional challenges.”
“In the east, Russia has illegally annexed Crimea, continues to support the separatists in eastern Ukraine; and now appears to have entered the war in Syria firmly on the side of Assad,” he added.
The exercise, which continues until November 6, is centered on demonstrating that NATO can quickly move decisive military force beyond its borders to attack its enemies. The war games are built around a scenario of NATO defending the fictional nation of “Lakuta” against an attack by a regional adversary, “Kamon.”
“Rising political instability, ethnic tension, and persisting socio-economic challenges are climaxed by a blatant invasion of one state's territory by another,” the official NATO scenario for the exercise reads.
It is evident that the exercise is meant to reproduce a possible evolution of conditions in the former Soviet Baltic republics, all of which are ruled by right-wing, fanatically anti-Russian governments that have imposed brutal austerity measures against the working class, discriminate against large ethnic Russian populations and glorify their citizens who collaborated with the Nazis in World War II.
In September of last year, President Barack Obama traveled to Estonia and offered an unqualified commitment under Article 5 of the NATO charter to use American troops to defend the Baltic States against the supposed threat from Russia. Calling this commitment “unwavering” and “eternal,” he stressed that he was prepared to deliver “American boots on the ground.”
Ukraine, which is not a member of NATO, has sent its military to participate in the NATO war games. The escalating confrontation between the US and Russia was triggered by the February 2014 coup that ousted the Ukrainian government of Viktor Yanukovych after it rejected a proposed European Union association agreement and sought a Russian loan bailout instead. The coup was orchestrated by Washington and Berlin and spearheaded by fascist militias. The overthrow of the government was followed by a bloody civil war, with the new US-backed regime in Kiev attempting to militarily suppress ethnic Russian rebels in the east of the country.
The latest proposals for troop deployments on Russia's borders follow earlier decisions by NATO to establish a 40,000-strong “rapid reaction force” as well as small headquarters, known as NATO Force Integration Units, in Hungary, Slovakia, the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania as well as in Bulgaria, Poland and Romania. These commands, consisting of about 80 personnel each, are designed to prepare for rapid deployment of NATO troops against Russia. In addition, plans were elaborated to pre-position arms and supplies including tanks and other heavy weaponry in striking distance of Russia.
In response to the reports of the new proposals for escalation of NATO's military buildup, Moscow's ambassador to the US-led alliance, Alexander Grushko, charged that they, as well as previous measures, were in violation of agreements reached in the 1990s in which NATO pledged not to station a substantial number of combat troops on Russia's borders.
“From the political point of view these military activities are aimed at creating a new ‘Iron Curtain' in Europe,” Grushko said. He added, “Our security will be safeguarded in any case, and we have a variety of choices to effectively do it.”
The seemingly deliberate intensification of tensions in Eastern Europe coincides with convening in Vienna of another session of talks on the Syrian crisis. Russia has carried out hundreds of airstrikes and provided other military assistance in an attempt to prop up the government of President Bashar al-Assad, even as Washington, which like Moscow claims to be fighting “terrorism,” continues to support Islamist militias seeking Assad's overthrow.
The response of President Vladimir Putin's government to the US-led imperialist offensive is both reactionary and politically bankrupt. Based on Russian nationalism and the defense of the interests of the capitalist oligarchy that enriched itself from the looting of state property with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Putin's policy oscillates between the flexing of military power and seeking accommodation with imperialism.
On Thursday, the US Navy acknowledged having sent four-armed fighter jets to confront two Russian Tu-142 Bear aircraft that were flying near the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan, which was engaged in naval exercises near the Korean peninsula. The Russian planes were reportedly flying at 500 feet and within one mile of the US warship. Attempts by a US escort ship to hail the Russian aircraft received no response.
The potential for a military confrontation between the US and Russia, whether in Eastern Europe, Syria or elsewhere, grows daily. The dangers of a conflict spiraling into a nuclear war are becoming greater today than they were at the height of the Cold War.

Welcome to Festival Outlook, a new supplemental column that will provide more in-depth analysis for the rumors found on Consequence of Sound's Festival Outlook. With the 2014 lineup announcement just days away, Alex Young and Frank Mojica get us started with a discussion on all things Coachella.
Alex Young (AY): This is the first time in a long while that we know such a substantial portion of Coachella's lineup prior to the January announcement. Arcade Fire and OutKast are a lock to each headline a day, and it's looking increasingly likely that Muse are the third headliner, or possibly a co-headliner alongside Nine-Inch Nails. Other heavily rumored acts include Neutral Milk Hotel, CHVRCHES, HAIM, Mogwai, Empire of the Sun, Pixies, Placebo, and Lorde. My question to you, Frank, is why do you think Coachella has had such a difficult time keeping this year's lineup under wraps? Also, do any of the aforementioned acts surprise you? I think most people assumed Coachella would eventually book OutKast and Neutral Milk Hotel.
Frank Mojica (FM): The 2014 experience has definitely been a different one from last year. I remember 2013's headliners were assumed to include Daft Punk and The Rolling Stones well into January. If Coachella is like Christmas for adults, then this year's lineup takes me back to the year when my parents just dumped all the presents into the extra bedroom, rather than wrapping or hiding them right away, so I knew almost everything I was getting.
As for why this has been the case, I think things have gone well in the booking process, so most headliners and major acts have been secured for a while, rather than at the last minute. I recall reading that Red Hot Chili Peppers were literally signed to headline hours before the poster was released. None of the current rumors surprise me, except OutKast, which would have been a major jaw-dropper had the secret been kept under wraps. The surprising part about OutKast isn't that they're playing Coachella, but that they are finally together and touring again. Although Neutral Milk Hotel's sudden reunion came as a surprise, I knew that it would eventually include a visit to the Polo grounds.
Yes, this is a fake.
Muse looks likely, but I have a feeling that Tool might surprise us. Imagine if Tool and Nine-Inch Nails co-headlined a night. That would be one for the ages for all of us that were angry adolescents in the '90s. Of course, all this is just speculation on my part, although I did have a dream that it happened.
So, the cat is out of the bag for Arcade Fire, OutKast, Neutral Milk Hotel, and seemingly every 2013 rookie with good publicity. However, there are always left field reunions and unexpected rarities every year.
AY: For all we already know, there are still many questions left to be answered. Will The Replacements continue their reunion activities into 2014 and finally hit the Polo Grounds? What about Sleater-Kinney? The band recently reunited onstage during a Pearl Jam concert, and with Wild Flag no more, it certainly seems like that reunion is on the table. Boards of Canada were on many folks' list last year, and their absence from 2013's lineup was especially surprising given their album release. The same can also be said about The Knife, of course. If I had to guess, I'd expect at least three of those acts to end up on the lineup.
One of my favorite parts about Coachella, and all festivals for that matter, is how high (or low) an act is placed on a lineup. If Sleater-Kinney does end up playing, I can't envision them being any higher than the third line. On the flip side, I can't imagine Foster the People being on anything but the second line. I raised this possibility earlier, but if Muse and Nine-Inch Nails are booked for the same day, will they be listed as co-headliners, or will Muse get stand-alone billing? These days, Nine-Inch Nails is nowhere near as big a band as Muse is, at least by mainstream Top 40 standards, but I could totally see a Stone Roses/Blur situation purely out of respect for Trent Reznor.
I also think Tool is a possibility, especially given their dates scheduled in South America in the weeks prior to Coachella. Though, I'm not sure their booking makes sense in a year where Arcade Fire and OutKast will also headline. Last week someone on the Coachella message board argued that OutKast would be a sub-headliner if it were not for their reunion, and I tend to agree. Them getting back together is huge news for rabid music fans and blog readers, but do André and Big Boi have the pull to draw 60,000? I think that remains to be seen. Arcade Fire are at the height of their popularity right now, but I think the left field direction of Reflektor and their recent bit of quirkiness (e.g., dresscodegate) make them a similar draw to Phoenix last year. And what did Goldenvoice end up doing to mitigate the risks of booking two UK-centric reunion acts and an arena-status indie band as headliners? Book Red Hot Chili Peppers, who are still the biggest rock band around, like it or not. That's why I have a hard time seeing Goldenvoice opt for Tool over the much more popular and safe Muse.
The government formally announced Tuesday the U.S. Air Force will deploy a squadron of tilt-rotor CV-22 Osprey aircraft at Yokota Air Base in western Tokyo in 2017.
The news immediately drew a chorus of protests from residents of towns and cities in the area.
However, Japanese officials immediately welcomed the announcement and tried to downplay concerns about the controversial plane's safety.
The U.S. Defense Department said in a statement that the first three aircraft will arrive at Yokota in the second half of 2017, and an additional seven are scheduled be stationed there by 2021.
Yokota Air Base occupies parts of the cities and towns of Fussa, Mizuho, Musashimurayama, Hamura, Tachikawa and Akishima in western Tokyo.
Many local residents have complained of noise generated by U.S. military aircraft taking off or landing at the base and are concerned about the possibility of accidents.
“(The deployment) in our country will bolster the deterrent power of the Japan-U.S. alliance and its capability to cope with” various emergencies, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference, welcoming the Pentagon announcement.
“It will also help stabilize the Asia-Pacific region,” he added.
The Osprey can take off vertically like a helicopter and then, by tilting its rotors, fly horizontally like an airplane.
During its development phase, the Osprey was blamed for four deadly accidents that killed a total of 30 people, and questions were raised about its safety.
The U.S. developed the Osprey as the main successor to the CH-46E helicopter. The Osprey can fly twice as fast as the CH-46E and has four times the range, according to the Defense Ministry.
The recent deployment of the MV-22, the U.S. Marines' version of the aircraft, in Okinawa caused a lot of controversy among local residents because of the safety concerns.
Both the Pentagon and the Japanese government have stressed that the accident rate of the MV-22 is not particularly high when compared with other aircraft being used by the U.S. Marines.
According to the Defense Ministry, the MV-22's accident rate for 100,000 flying hours was 1.93 from October 2003 until April 2012. For various helicopters the rate was 1.11 for the CH-46E, 4.51 for the CH-53D and 2.35 for the CD-53E.
But the accident rate for the CV-22, the version used by the U.S. Air Force, stood at 13.47 as of June 2012, nearly seven times higher than that of the MV-22, the Defense Ministry said.
The U.S. Air Force often flies CV-22s on special low-altitude missions, which is believed to be one of the reasons for its higher accident rate, media reports say.
During Tuesday's news conference, Suga claimed the MV-22 and CV-22 craft are “identical” in terms of structure and safety features.
“We will naturally put top priority on safety. We should think about it until the latter half of 2017, when (CV-22s) will be deployed” at Yokota, he said.
The U.S. government has recently decided to sell 17 Ospreys to the Ground Self-Defense Force for about ¥360 billion.
“The deployment of tilt-rotor aircraft (at Yokota) will provide increased capability for U.S. Special Operations Forces to respond quickly to crises and contingencies in Japan and across the Asia-Pacific region, including humanitarian crises and natural disasters,” the Pentagon said in a press release issued Monday in Washington.
“It will also increase interoperability, enhance operational cooperation and promote stronger defense relations with Japan's Self-Defense Forces,” it said.
Local residents were angered by the announcement.
“Surrounding areas of the base are crammed with houses,” said Katsuhiko Iwata, 75, a leading member of a residential group that deals with issues involving the Yokota base. “If an aircraft were to crash, it would cause a great deal of damage.”
The base's fences are surround by houses, schools and hospitals — a situation similar to the U.S. Marine Corps Futenma base in Okinawa Prefecture.
“In the U.S., (Ospreys) don't fly over residential areas,” Iwata said. “What do they think Japan is . . . a colony?”

Remember how hard Rep. Paul Ryan tried to spin his disastrous budget with its scheme to end Medicare? Back during the spring recess, he insisted that the constituents booing him at his town meetingshis Medicare plan, saying the "crowds are overwhelmingly supportive."
When that didn't really work, he shifted his spin saying that, really, the plan wasn't unpopular, it was just misunderstood. People would love it, really, once the Republicans figured out a way to talk about it that didn't terrify people.
Meanwhile, there were the polls. Like this PPP poll done in June in North Carolina, finding that voters were opposed to the plan by an almost 2:1 margin. In North Carolina. There are any number of polls demonstrating just how unpopular it is.
Undaunted, Ryan has kept up his happy talk, and finally found a buyer. Check out the headline from CNN's Gloria Borger and Kevin Bohn: "Paul Ryan: Popular by pushing the unpopular." That's only slightly more embarrassing than their lede.
Washington (CNN) -- To hear Paul Ryan explain it, there's just one way to cope with becoming the Democrats' favorite man to hate: "I gave fear up for Lent this year," Ryan told CNN during an extensive interview. And he's not kidding.
The fluff just gets fluffier from there, culminating in the ultimate.
Ryan was pushed again this summer to run for the Republican presidential nomination by assorted GOP luminaries. His answer: No, not yet. "I think there are other good people who can do this job," he told CNN. "But there are not other good people who can raise my kids."
Needless to say, there's absolutely no analysis on what Ryan's budget plan would actually do to America, the massive giveaways to the wealthiest people in America, the tax increases on the middle-class, and forcing seniors into the morass of private insurance.
But hey, he's the latest GOP savior, so unpopular he's actually popular, a latter day John Galt himself. At least, that's what Ryan told Borger and Bohn. It's his story, and they're sticking with it.

Peter Thiel participates in a panel discussion on Nov. 3 in New York City. Neilson Barnard/Getty Images
Peter Thiel is an eccentric libertarian and successful tech investor who has had a lot of crazy ideas: that Methuselan life spans are just around the corner, that America's best and brightest should live together on man-made islands floating around the sea, that Donald Trump would be a good president. A multibillionaire, he has the ability to support these ideas. His vast fortune means that he is free to ignore any evidence that his ideas are stupid and that he does not have to tolerate those who disagree with him. That's one of the great things about being superrich: Your wealth serves as a shield—and, if you want, a bludgeon.
This week, the world learned of Thiel's latest expensive, crazy idea: destroying Gawker Media. As Forbes first reported, Thiel secretly bankrolled a lawsuit against Gawker Media brought by the wrestler Hulk Hogan, spending a reported $10 million on his plot, in addition to the funding of other lawsuits. (In 2012, Gawker posted an excerpt of a homemade sex tape featuring Hogan—who from 2005 to 2007 starred in a reality TV series called Hogan Knows Best that portrayed him as a devoted family man—in flagrante with a woman who was not his wife.) The lawsuit has been successful: In March, a jury handed down a $140.1 million verdict that will bankrupt Gawker Media if it stands. On Wednesday, a Florida judge upheld that verdict. And on Thursday, multiple outlets reported that Gawker Media founder Nick Denton may be seeking to sell the company—though it's unlikely that anyone would want to buy the company before the Hogan suit is ultimately resolved.
What made Thiel so upset with Gawker Media? In 2007, the Gawker Media site Valleywag ran a story reporting that Thiel “is totally gay, people.” Gawker Media was founded on the principle of saying the things that people in certain privileged circles all know to be true but for whatever reason don't care to share with the public. Former Valleywag editor Owen Thomas, who wrote the story in question, on Wednesday told Andrew Ross Sorkin of the New York Times that many people already knew that Thiel was gay at the time the story was written and that he believes Thiel “was out and not in the closet.” But Thiel was enraged by the story and others from Gawker that, in his opinion, “ruined people's lives for no reason.” He vowed to get Gawker, ostensibly to stand up for his own notions of privacy. But his actions suggest he was out for a corpse, and now Thiel is on the verge of seeing this particular scheme come true.
All of this should matter to you, even if you're neither a tech entrepreneur nor a journalist. Thiel's newly revealed revenge plot is an epochal wakeup call that should concern everyone. Granted, rich people have tried to counteract and forestall news coverage they dislike for generations, usually by pulling their advertising from the outlets in question, occasionally by purchasing those outlets (calling Sheldon Adelson), and often by suing. But it takes a special kind of vindictiveness to devise a long-term scheme to punish a news outlet, pursue the scheme in secret through the courts, and then appear proud of one's actions once exposed. Thiel's lawsuit-funding will have a chilling effect on journalists and journalism, not least by asserting the power of the richest and least accountable among us to define what constitutes acceptable discourse and to punish those who violate these arbitrary standards. That's something none of us should tolerate.
Reasonable people can disagree on the merit and propriety of Gawker's practice of writing about the sexualities of powerful people. The problem here is that Thiel has bought the right to decide where that line should fall and who is allowed to cross it.
“I refuse to believe that journalism means massive privacy violations,” Thiel, who has donated to the Committee to Protect Journalists, told the Times' Sorkin in an astonishing interview on Wednesday. “It's precisely because I respect journalists that I do not believe they are endangered by fighting back against Gawker.” Yes, there's no better way to show your respect for journalists than by funding a brutal lawsuit that, if successful, will cause dozens and dozens of them to lose their jobs. Irrespective of whether you like Gawker Media and appreciate its blunt, impudent style of journalism, its employees are without question journalists. The stories published on the website's network are factually based. When its reporters get stories wrong, they cop to their errors.
Gawker Media occasionally screws up, as all journalists do, but most of its controversial stories are products of an aggressively public-spirited editorial philosophy that's the polar opposite of Thiel's ideal of enforced niceness. The Gawker Media sites have long been reflexively suspicious of and adversarial toward those whose money or social status shield them from outside scrutiny, and its best stories—Deadspin's ongoing coverage of NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and his inept efforts to protect the league's reputation in the face of numerous, often self-inflicted scandals; Dave McKenna's outstanding coverage of creepy Sacramento mayor and former NBA star Kevin Johnson; Gawker's coverage of the sexual-assault allegations against Bill Cosby—hold these people to account. Gawker Media's coverage of Peter Thiel and his entrepreneurial colleagues, though often rude, has served as a necessary corrective to the fawning profiles and news-release regurgitation that too often constitutes tech coverage in America, a reminder that these companies are run by people—fallible, self-centered, often stupid people.
Gawker's ressentiment is not always a virtue, and it has led it to sometimes go after people who do not deserve its scrutiny. Righteous zeal in excess can be a bad thing. But it's much, much worse to surreptitiously spend $10 million to bankrupt and destroy a news organization against which you hold a grudge. Speaking to the Times' Sorkin, Thiel justified his vendetta, saying, “It's not like it is some sort of speaking truth to power or something going on here. The way I've thought about this is that Gawker has been a singularly terrible bully.” Thiel is contorting the definition of bully to mean someone who makes me feel uncomfortable. But good journalism is often the act of making powerful people feel uncomfortable, and in this era of vast wealth disparities, few people are more powerful than the Croesan tech executives who hope to change the world by creating widgets, apps, and floating man-made islands.
If Thiel was spending $10 million in secret to get rid of a problem, what other problems are he and other tech plutocrats spending money on to eliminate? The under-regulation of the tech industry—the way that many “disruptive innovators” operate free from constraints that hamper their more established competitors—isn't just a function of legislative inertia. Big tech companies have well-funded lobbying offices in Washington and elsewhere, and like all rich entities, everywhere, always, they are accustomed to throwing money at their problems. As Felix Salmon pointed out at Fusion, Thiel's success with the Gawker lawsuit has essentially given other billionaires a blueprint for how to get rid of any journalist or critic in their way.
Our polity benefits when sites like Gawker, which aren't dependent on relationships and access, surface these issues and hold them up to scrutiny. This is not bullying. This is acting in the public interest. Peter Thiel is acting in his own interest. His success means that there may now be fewer people around with the guts and resources to question him and his ilk.
Disclosure: One Slate editor is married to a Gawker editor. One is married to a lawyer who represented Gawker in the Hulk Hogan trial. One is a former Gawker Media executive editor. None of these Slate staffers worked on this story.

Elvis Presley's famous hairstyle was called after her, a French champagne glass is believed to have been modelled after her breast, and according to the legend, the ‘marquise cut' diamond was commissioned to resemble the shape of her mouth… Yet, Madame de Pompadour left her legacy way further as she was the uncrowned queen of France and the arts. See Madame de Pompadour in portraits:
A Planned Future
It was destiny that Jeanne Antoinette Poisson became a chief mistress to the king Louis XV: when she was small, a fortune teller prophesied that she would one day win the heart of the king. Therefore, when she entered the adolescent age, her mother oversaw her training to become a royal mistress-to-be. She had to memorize entire plays by heart, dance, sing, paint, engrave and play the clavichord.
A Marriage
At age 19 she married into d'Étiolles family, which was an obvious marriage of convenience. She had two children with her husband Charles-Guillaume Le Normant, but both of them died in childhood. Antoinette soon founded her own salon which became very popular in Parisian circles and which was attended by many intellectuals, such as Voltaire, with whom she became close friends.
A Meeting
She turned into a real celebrity, to an extent that the king himself heard rumors of her intelligence, talents and beauty. A group of courtiers decided to promote her to the king, and a masked ball at Versailles seemed to be a perfect occasion to do this. In 1745, Antoinette, dressed up as a domino, met a plant. A royal plant, of course. A month later she was already king's mistress, installed in the palace in an apartament connected with king's chambers by a secret staircase.

A patronage
She was a passionate patron of the architects, furniture craftsmen, interior designers, writers, painters, and sculpturers. She was also an artist herself, she made engravings and drawings, and she even brought to Versailles the most talented gem carver to teach her how to make gems. She carved little scenes and cameos into semi-precious stones for rings and bracelets which she would later give out as gifts. She was also responsible for the development of Sèvres, which became one of the most famous porcelain manufacturers in Europe. She protected the Physiocrates, a group of French Enlightenment economists, and supported and defended the development of Diderot's Encyclopédie against those of the Church who sought to have it suppressed.
A Portrait
Portraits of Madame de Pompadour were a genre in itself. She used portraits to communicate with the king and the French, announcing her loyalty, love, intellect… She was hailed as a major innovator and “the sponsor and queen of the Rococo”, according to Goncourt brothers. François Boucher found in Mme de Pompadour his most enthusiastic admirer. Only after her death, however, in 1765, was he appointed First Painter to the King.
A scandal
Besides portraits, she commissioned from Boucher projects for tapestries, which were meant to be woven exclusively for her. She picked the story from Ovid about rising and setting of the sun, everything was symbolic, as you can imagine. In this painting Boucher depicted her as the nymph Tethys welcoming the returning sun, Louis XV. The paintings were shown at the Salon in 1753 and raised quite a clamour.

The French cartoonist Zeon was [arrested] Tuesday morning … by four police officers of the Brigade of Repression of Delinquency People (BRDP).
[At 7am] four police officers woke the cartoonist to take him before the judge to the High Court Instance of Paris. A complaint appears to have been filed by the BNVCA (National Bureau of Vigilance against Anti-Semitism).
The complaint seems to refer to the drawing – for which Zeon had yet been released last year by the 17th chamber – representing a balance and unbalanced weight of several historical crimes, but also for another drawing, which was not retained by the prosecutor at the trial, representing a Palestinian child stabbed by a Israel-shaped knife.
The judge has indicted the designer of incitement to racial, religious hatred, by speech, writing, picture or means of electronic communication. Zeon refused to answer his questions. He was set free in late morning.
Quick reminder on the BNVCA
The National Bureau of Vigilance against Racism and Anti-Semitism was founded by the Commissioner of Police Sammy Ghozlan in March 2002 with Union support Jewish bosses of France and the Word and Light Association (offshoot of the Simon Center Wiesenthal).
According BNVCA site itself, this organization has a unique community privilege to make complaints of “anti-Semitic aggression.”
The Jehovah's Witnesses leadership has created sophisticated strategies to conceal allegations of sexual abuse. Witnesses instruct local elders to keep claims of molestation private, internal documents show, all the while collecting detailed information on predators in their ranks.
For abuse victims, this can mean enduring a variety of hardships, such as being ignored by leaders and shunned by family and friends. Based on Reveal reporter Trey Bundy's ongoing investigation, here are five issues victims have encountered.
1. They've been ignored.
It took Jose Lopez, a former Witness, nearly 30 years to find justice after being sexually abused by a member of his congregation. When his mother reported the abuse to elders in 1986, they did not call the police or warn other parents. Instead, they promoted his abuser, Gonzalo Campos, through the ranks – even as he continued to molest other children. In 1994, when another family brought allegations of Campos' abuse to elders, they were told too much time had passed and nothing could be done. Campos was removed from the congregation in 1995 but reinstated five years later.
The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, the organization's parent organization, has instructed elders in all 14,000 U.S. congregations to avoid lawsuits by keeping reports of child abuse secret – from other Witnesses as well as from law enforcement agencies.

2. They've been shunned.
Or “disfellowshipped,” in the Witnesses parlance. This practice, described in a recent investigation, is similar to excommunication in the Catholic church. Congregants who have been disfellowshipped – for offenses such as smoking, homosexuality and speaking up about child abuse – are barred from the organization until they've repented adequately. During the ostracism, they can expect to be ignored by all members of their community, including their own families.
It's hard to overstate the implications of being ostracized this way. Because Jehovah's congregations – especially those in small communities – are insular and tightly knit, being disfellowshipped can mean being completely ignored by your friends and family.
3. They've had to face an abuser.
Elders in McAlester, Oklahoma, asked Debbie McDaniel to confront her abuser, Ronald Lawrence, in person with the details of her accusations against him. That's because Jehovah's Witnesses protocol is to have two elders mediate a faceoff between the accused and the accuser to decide whether the claims have merit and warrant action. This is different from a court of law, where it is rare for a child to confront an abuser face to face.
4. They've had to beg their way back in – sometimes at the feet of an abuser.
McDaniel was disfellowshipped for immoral sexual conduct. As the congregation's top elder, Lawrence had served as the chairman of the committee that disfellowshipped her and voted to push her out.
“I thought it ironic,” McDaniel said, “that the man who had molested me was now going to oust me to keep his congregation clean.”
When McDaniel wanted back into the congregation, she was told she had to write a letter to Lawrence apologizing for her conduct.
She was allowed to start attending meetings once more, on the condition that she sit in the back, alone, and that no one – including her family – speak to her until she officially was reinstated.
5. One says she's been targeted for speaking out.
The morning McDaniel was slated to appear as the face of Bundy's investigation, the house she shares with her wife was vandalized with black marker. McDaniel suspects that the notes – “WatchTower Knows All” and “We'll Be Watching You in Mexico Too!” – were written by local members of the Jehovah's Witnesses community. The second message, she said, referred to a trip to Mexico she'd planned with her wife; they canceled their vacation.
Local police, who are familiar with McDaniel's story, are treating the vandalism as a hate crime.

Martin Wolf, Chief Economic Commentator of the Financial Times, examines how policymakers are testing the norms of economic life as they seek solutions to slow growth. The payment of interest goes back to the Babylonians. Today, the business of banking is based on paying savers and charging borrowers for money. Negative interest rates, paying banks for holding our funds, violates this established norm. Yet, five central banks, which together oversee a quarter of the world's economy, have opted to impose negative rates on the commercial banks that must use their services. The aim of this unconventional policy is to convince people to spend and invest rather save. The results so far have been mixed. So might central banks be running out of options to boost economic growth, nearly ten years after the start of the last financial crisis? Martin Wolf talks with economists and central bankers, past and present, about why ideas once thought utterly shocking, such as "helicopter money" and a abolition of cash, are being openly considered. How might such policies affect the way people spend and save in the future? And how low can interest rates go?

IN THEORY Chinese officials receive promotions based on their performance against a range of targets: delivering strong growth, maintaining social stability and, until recently, enforcing the one-child policy. But scholars debate whether the system really rewards those who excel according to these (in any case flawed) metrics. Some believe the emphasis on merit is real, and helps explain China's stunning economic progress over the past 35 years. Others reckon that connections to the right leaders matter more for those trying to advance their careers. New research, however, suggests a third option: that those who get ahead are adept not at stimulating growth nor at currying favour, but at cooking the books.
A recent paper from America's National Bureau of Economic Research uses fertility rates as a way to test this theory. Economists have found a relationship between GDP growth in an official's fiefdom and subsequent promotion, but it is difficult to know how accurate the GDP figures are (a question that haunts anyone following the Chinese economy). Population data are different: in addition to the figures provided by local officials, China conducts a census every ten years, revising population data all the way down to the village level. That makes it possible to pinpoint where bureaucrats have been fiddling the statistics.

Examining data on 967 mayors in 28 provinces from 1985 to 2000, Juan Carlos Suárez Serrato and Xiao Yu Wang of Duke University and Shuang Zhang of University of Colorado, Boulder, find that officials who claimed to have suppressed population growth were rewarded. Mayors who reduced the local birth rate by one child per 1,000 people per year by their own count had a 10% greater chance of being promoted.
But the relationship between fertility rates and career trajectory disappears when using the census data rather than the figures reported by the local officials themselves. Mayors who received promotions were no better or worse at curbing population growth than those who did not. The way to get ahead in the Chinese bureaucracy, it seems, is to falsify statistics. It makes you wonder what other data have been doctored.
Head of Austria's far right Freedom Party (FPOe) Heinz-Christian Strache addresses the media in Vienna, Austria, December 6, 2016. REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader
VIENNA (Reuters) - The head of Austria's far-right Freedom Party, Heinz-Christian Strache, has said he will travel to Washington for meetings “on the sidelines of” the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, though he did not specify who.
In a statement on his Facebook page, the head of the anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPO) did not say whether he would attend the inauguration ceremony on Jan. 20, but did state he would not be meeting Trump himself. Spokesmen for his party were not immediately available for comment.
Strache's visit is likely to raise fresh questions about ties between European far-right parties and people close to Trump. FPO officials met people close to Trump, including his pick for national security adviser Michael Flynn, on a recent visit to the United States, the party said last month.
“There is a series of invitations to talks with interesting political representatives of the United States on the sidelines of the U.S. president's inauguration on our packed schedule,” Strache said, adding that he would be accompanied by an FPO delegation.
French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen was seen at Trump Tower last week, but a spokesman for Trump said she did not meet with him or his team.
The Kleine Zeitung newspaper said Strache's delegation would include Norbert Hofer, who narrowly failed to become president last year, which would have made him the first freely elected far-right head of state in Europe since World War Two.
Strache said “good diplomatic and economic relations” between Austria and the United States were a priority for him given his party's “possible future government responsibilities”. Austria's centrist government's mandate runs until next year.
“In order to avoid unnecessary speculation, a meeting with the future U.S. president, Donald Trump, is not planned,” Strache said.
Former Dolphins receiver Mark Duper has been arrested and accused of punching a child, knocking him unconscious and threatening to kill him.
Local 10 in Miami reports that Duper was arrested in Jacksonville and accused of child abuse.
According to the arrest form, Duper punched a child and knocked him unconscious and threatened to kill the child. According to News 4 in Jacksonville, the victim was a teenager, and another man came to his aid and pulled Duper off him. The victim was able to leave the house where the incident took place, and the Department of Children and Families was called in to investigate.
A member of the Dolphins' Ring of Honor, Duper was selected to three Pro Bowls in the 1980s. He is one of the thousands of former players currently suing the NFL over concussions.
Washington Opponent's Record: 10-3
Record this Week: 10-3
Record in Games that Mattered: 10-2
The last two weeks (since Eastern Washington played last week as well) have been pretty good for UW's 2014 opponents. The only surprise loss was Wazzu's loss to Rutgers at home ... which was, well, forgetable. However, Cal pulled out a nice win on the road against Northwestern. Continue reading for cool stats and video.
Sam Houston (0-1) @ Eastern Washington (1-0)
Eastern and Sam Houston played the first official football game of the 2014 season. When these two teams meet, the teams usually combine for 70 or more points ... and this game was not different. Sam Houston pulled within 7 points with 7 minutes to go in the 4th quarter, but that was as close as they would get. Eagles quarterback Vernon Adams Jr. gashed Sam Houston on the last two drives, and the Eagles score two more unanswered touchdowns, finishing out the game with a flourish. Vernon Adams finished the game 26 of 48, with four TDs and one interception. Final Score: Eagles win 56-35.
Montana Western (1-1) @ Eastern Washington (2-0)
Montana Western came to Cheney, Washington, in what the Eagles called a warmup for their game with the Huskies. This game was never in doubt, as the Eagles ran away with this game. Vernon Adams Jr. had another impressive outing, going 28 for 31 (that's a 90.1% completion rate folks), gaining 370 yards, 5 touchdowns, and 0 interceptions. Final score: Eagles win 41-9.
Youngstown State (0-1) at Illinois (1-0)
The Illini hosted Youngstown State in a barn-burner. Illinois allowed Youngstown to take a lead until the 4th quarter before they decided enough was enough. Illinois scored 21 points in the 4th quarter, which was just enough to overcome the upset. Illini quarterback Wes Lunt was 24 for 38, with 285 yards, 4 TDs and 0 picks. Final score: Illinois wins 28-17.
Abilene Christian (0-1) @ Georgia State (1-0)
Similarly to Illinois, Georgia State did everything they could to give the other team confidence, before coming from behind in the 4th quarter for a dramatic home victory. This time, the victory came from a last second field goal. Georgia State QB Nick Arbuckle finished the game 31 of 47, gaining 413 yards, 4 TDs and 2 picks. Final score Georgia State wins 38-37.
UC Davis (0-1) @ Stanford (1-0)
This game was a rout from the beginning. The Cardinal scored 14 in the first quarter, and 24 in the second. Ty Montgomery returned his first punt for a touchdown, and Kevin Hogan finished the game going 12 for 16, 203 yards, 3 TDs and 1 interception. Stanford also rushed for 169 yards, and averaged 4.7 yards per carry. Final score: Stanford wins 45-0.
Cal (1-0) @ Northwestern (0-1)
Cal wanted to make a statement this game, and they wanted that statement to be a good one. Luckily, at least for Cal fans, that's exactly what the Golden Bears did. They jumped out to a 31-7 lead, and never relinquished it. Northwestern, at the end of the 4th quarter, made it all the way to the Cal 27. However, Jalen Jefferson came up big. First he sacked the QB for an 11 yard loss, and then on the next play he picked off a tipped ball to seal the game. Final score: Cal wins 31-24.
South Dakota (0-1) @ Oregon (1-0)
Oregon played host to South Dakota. The most notable thing in this game was Oregon's porous run defense. They were gashed multiple times. There were also the 5 penalties and there was also the injury in the first half to their star corner back Ifo Ekpre-Olomu, who sustained a non-contact ankle injury. Marcus Mariota was 14 for 20 with 267 yards, 3 TDs, 0 picks and an average of 13.4 yards per completion ... Final score: Oregon wins 62-13.
Weber State (0-1) @ Arizona (1-0)
A Weber State team, returning a bunch of experienced players, traveled down to Tempe, but they were really no match for the 19th ranked Sun Devils. ASU racked up 570 total yards of offense, 303 in the air and 267 on the ground. Taylor Kelly was only 18 for 27, and he only had 1 TD. The offense relied heavily on the run game, and they weren't disappointed their new RB D.J. Foster. He had 147 yards on 15 carries and 3 TDs to boot. Final score: Arizona State wins 45-14.
Colorado State (1-0) @ Colorado (0-1)
Colorado had high hopes for this year's Rocky Mountain Showdown ... CODawg did not. The game was close all the way to the 4th quarter. The Buffaloes were barely holding on to a 17-14 lead. They quickly relinquished that lead, however, as the Rams scored 17 unanswered points. The Buffalo defense just petered out. Colorado State gashed them in the second half with 185 yards. Things aren't looking great for CU right now. Final score: Colorado State wins 31-17.
UCLA (1-0) @ Virginia (0-1)
The Bruins made the long trek to the east coast, and showed everyone on over there how "potent" their offense was. Boy was the Bruin offense fragrant. Their O-line gave up 5 sacks, and numerous other hits on Brett Hundley. The Bruins were up 21-10 at half time, but they had failed to score a single point on offense. Their first offensive points didn't come until the third quarter, a TD drive capped by a 6-yard run from Hundley. Final score: UCLA wins 28-20.
Portland State (0-1) @ Oregon State (1-0)
This game was really one-sided. The only problem, was that the score didn't reflect it. Oregon State could not get into the endzone, and they were down by one point at the end of the first half. Portland State didn't cross midfield until the second quarter. In the second half, Oregon State forced 5 turnovers, and that basically sealed it. However, the Beavers only scored 16 points on those 5 turnovers ... yeah, at least they didn't lose to another FCS team to start the season. Final score: Oregon State wins 29-14.
Rutgers (1-0) @ Washington State (0-1)
Wazzu had big expectations this year, and everybody in Pullman figured this first game, against a Rutgers team that was less than mediocre last year, would at least give them a W, and a little bit closer to a bowl game ... well that didn't happen! Up 31-24 to start the the Cougars were in the driver's seat. They promptly drove over a cliff ..., in a fashion that so many Cougar fans have become accustomed to over the years. They gave up a field goal and then a TD, and hit the endzone to retake the lead, and the relinquished for the last time ... Final score: Rutgers wins 41-38
President Obama lambasted Marco Rubio on his home turf on Thursday, slamming the Senator who ran against Donald Trump in the primary, yet later endorsed his controversial candidacy.
“Donald Trump wants to reverse progress,” Obama told the crowd at Florida Memorial University. “Marco Rubio wants to help him.”
Obama refused to give Republicans a great deal of credit for denouncing some of Trump's nastier controversies, including a leaked tape on which he can be heard bragging about groping women. He instead said their reactions were too little, too late, going so far as to call Rubio's actions the “height of cynicism” and proof that he would say or do anything to get elected.
“How can you call him a con artist and dangerous and object to all the controversial things he says, and then say, ‘I'm still going to vote for him'?” Obama said. “Come on, man!” Obama repeatedly called Rubio a bad choice for the Floridians in the audience, urging them instead to vote for his opponent, Representative Patrick Murphy, whom he praised as a good leader.

Rubio's team slammed Murphy in a statement: “Patrick Murphy has accomplished nothing during his four years in Congress — even the President couldn't think of anything nice to say about him,” Olivia Perez-Cubas, Rubio's press secretary, said.
Obama also offered a public response to Trump's statements that he would only accept the results of the election if he were to win on Nov. 8. Suggestions that the vote would be somehow rigged, he said, are not only whining but also dangerous for the country.
“That is not a joking matter. That is dangerous. When you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people's minds about the legitimacy of our elections, that undermines our democracy,” Obama said.
Obama was in Florida to deliver a speech on the Affordable Care Act, and afterward he stopped by Florida Memorial University for the rowdy speech. The President had been scheduled to attend a rally for Clinton in Florida earlier this month, but it was rescheduled due to Hurricane Matthew.
The President, who already voted early in Illinois, urged early voting in the Sunshine State where a 2013 report found long lines discouraged some 200,000 people from casting ballots. “When you vote early, there are no lines,” he said. “You can take your time.”
“Starting Monday you can reject somebody who proves himself unfit to be President every single day in every single way,” Obama said, urging the crowd to vote early in the battleground state. “You don't need to wait until Nov. 8 to send Hillary to the White House.”

From the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (a newswire service) last year:
Mark Zuckerberg is the world's richest Jew, according to Forbes billionaire list March 2, 2016 12:20pm (JTA) — Mark Zuckerberg is the sixth richest person in the world, and the richest Jew, after accumulating more wealth than anyone else in the past year. Eleven of the 50 richest people in the world are Jewish, according to the 30th annual Forbes billionaires list released Tuesday. The list features five Jews in the top 15 and seven in the top 25 spots.
If Jews make up about 0.2% of the world's population, 22% of the Top Fifty represents about two orders of magnitude higher representation.
Last I checked, in 2011, Jews also represented about 22% of the hard science (Physics, Chemistry, Medicine) Nobel Prize winners since 1901. That's impressive.
It's doubly impressive to be equally well-represented in two types of achievement — making billions and winning Nobels — that are pretty different in personality.
Ricky Gervais is making a version of hit show The Office for Chinese television, the star has confirmed on his blog.
The sitcom, set in a Slough paper company, made Gervais a household name and has been remade for viewers around the world.
Best known of the remakes is the US version starring Hollywood funnyman Steve Carell.
But versions have also been made in countries like France and Israel.
Writing on his blog, Gervais said: "I have some amazing news too. We are about to start work on developing a Chinese 'The Office'. How cool is that?"
The 49-year-old is also working with long term collaborator Stephen Merchant on a new project - Life's Too Short - about the day-to-day frustrations of a dwarf.
The show's been commissioned by the BBC and the pair will appear on screen as well as being executive producers.
I have found that for the ‘just stepped out of a painting' effect, you generally need to address what you are going to do with the top of your head. For many locations and time periods, this means considering what sort of hat or veil you should wear. For middle to late 16th century Italy, it means that you need to figure out how to dress your hair.
While wearing your hair down might feel very pretty, it is not a common sight in period images, except for biblical or getting-dressed scenes.
Let's take a quick look at some portraits and what sort of styles ladies are wearing in northern Italy.
I do so love Anguissola's paintings. She lived in Cremona and Milan, and I feel that her paintings before 1560 mostly reflect fashions of those areas (Lombardy region). She did many paintings of herself and her sisters, mostly portraying all the girls with a small section of hair rolled back from the hairline, always center parted, and with a twisted or braided element toward the back of their heads, often taped/sewn down with ribbon.
A few of her paintings show girls with fun curly fringe around the hairline, like the girl on the left above. Hairnets are not unusual, nor are the headband-like jewelry pieces.
This flickr gallery by Petrus Agricola is just lovely for looking at a bunch of Sofonisba Anguissola's paintings at once. Be careful about looking at anything past 1560 or so, since she moved to Spain to paint the courtly ladies, and any images past that point are too influenced by Spanish fashion.
In this portrait of a lady by an unknown artist, we can see that she has also rolled her fringe hair back, with quite a bit of volume visible on the left. It looks like her gold hair jewelry might actually be in the middle of that roll. The back of her head must be interesting, we can only see a small portion of her hair length. It doesn't look braided to me, perhaps twisted and then anchored in place with the white ribbons?
Allori is another fabulous painter for hair, although it would have been nice if he had painted more blond ladies. It's hard to see what's going on in all that dark hair.
Both of the paintings above show women with hair encircled in a strand of tiny pearls. It has a similar look to ribbon hairtaping, but it's more likely that they wrapped the braid in the strand of pearls, then secured it down with ribbon or pins. Both have hair jewelry, both have curled fringe.
And we cannot forget Moroni:
Isotta Brembatti by Giovanni Battista Moroni, 1552-1553
Portrait Of A Young Woman by Giovanni Battista Moroni, 1564-1570
Portrait Of A Lady by Giovanni Battista Moroni, 1556-60
Portrait of a Little Girl of the Redetti Family by Giovanni Battista Moroni, 1570
Isotta Brembati Grumelli by Battista Moroni, 1550-1555
Portret van een jonge vrouw by Giovanni B attista Moroni, 1560 – 1578
Many of the hairstyles above do not require shorter hair at the hairline (also known as bangs or fringe modernly), since you can simply roll your hair back from the hairline at any length to get a nice tapered look. But several of them clearly have long hair that has been put up into braids, but have little curls in the front. Some women naturally have a lot of little hairs shorter than the rest in that area, but I don't so I had to cut my hair to get the same look.
As you can see, I have sort of weird bangs: I have cut a little sliver of hair just at the edges of my hairline near my temple, but the shorter hair on top is the more normal triangular shaped base. Well, normal for modern bangs/fringe; the 16th century portraits look as though they did a thin section of shorter hair from ear to ear.
There are a few ways you could curl this area: in the picture above, I have wetted my hair and then pincurled very small sections at a time.
After it has dried, you can pull the pins out and have a messy pile of curls (which actually sort of remind me of the Venetian horns…) or you can gently roll the curls together to create a continuous roll, depending on your inspiration images. Pincurls are great for camping events, since you can set them up before bed, put a bandana on to protect them, and they'll be dry by morning (with no bandana, mine dry in about 3 hours).
However, if you are day-tripping an event from your home (or it's a hotel event) then you can use a curling iron instead, especially if you forgot to put your pin curls in before it was way too late for them to dry in time (which is the only reason I have the above pictures, oops!). Our curling irons require an outlet, but I'm imaging that period curling irons would have been similar to ruff setting iron sticks, and could have been heated up in the same way. I haven't actually done any research yet on 16th century hair curling methods, but since the technology was already there for ruffs, why not hair?
I get a lot of questions about how to add false hair to your own. You can braid up a piece of false hair and simply coil it into a bun around your own bun, but I like to add mine during the braiding process.
I got my hair from my local Sally Beauty Supply, for around $5 USD. It was just a length of hair, no clip or anything, already loosely braided I think. I split the hair in half, since I wanted to braid it into two different braids, and then I divided those sections into three, for a total of six sections. Each set of three got folded in half and then ‘knotted' together using the paranda method shown on Habioku's site (top middle photo).
I then add the knotted area to the base of my own hair, which is already split into three, and I add the three sections of the fake hair to my own, then braid as usual. The result is a braid that is really only a little bit bigger than my natural one since the false hair looks big, but actually compacts down a lot. You might then wonder why I am adding false hair to my own if it doesn't make a huge difference. Well, I don't add it usually. My hair is long enough now that I can complete the halo of braid around my head, so they are not very necessary at this point. But for fancy occasions, I'll sometimes add them for the little extra oomph they give to the whole look.
Now what if your natural braid has a lot of tapers? Starts out at a thickness you like, but thins down too much by the time you get to the end? You can add your false hair (demonstrated here with yarn) farther down your braid, rather than starting at the base. The knot at the top of your false hair is likely going to be visible on one side of your braid: make sure it's the side that will eventually be against your head.
Want to make your braid extra long but even along it's length (very useful for a single braid that encircles the head)? You can add multiple false hair pieces for a continuous look (keep them thin though!)
When you are done braiding, arrange the base of your braid in whatever direction you plan for your final hairstyle to verify that the beginning knot of your false hair isn't peeking out in a totally obvious way. If it does, rebraid that section of hair until it is invisible.
My synthetic hair matched the top half of my hair very well, but not so much on the bottom half. Since that part of my hair is several years old by now, it has been in the sun enough to bleach a little bit. I don't mind the mismatch too much.
If your own hair is much shorter than the augmented hair, then try to tuck your own ends into the false hair as you continue braiding, to reduce the amount of hair splaying out.
To mimic my Italian lovelies, especially the versions where the braid is just visible from the front, I wrap my braids around my head and pin them in place temporarily with hairpins or bobby pins.
If your hair roll becomes mussed from dressing or your hat, use your fingers to roll it back in place, starting at the part and continuing down, making sure the ends are tucked if the style requires that.
I could leave my hair like this if I like, since there are some portraits that don't appear to have any hairtaping, but if you want that pretty splash of contrasting color, go get your ribbon. Length is a bit hard to guess, my ribbons are usually about two-three arm lengths, depending on whether or not I am wrapping the ribbon around my head after my braid is taped down.
Once you have sewn the braids to your down, take the ends and tie them in a bow, either behind your neck or on top of your head. If you find that your ties are uneven, or you have too much slack, don't cut it shorter (unless you seriously have a lot of extra slack) otherwise you'll end up cutting it a little shorter every time you wear your hair like this, and that poor ribbon will become too short to use before long. So I fix that by either wrapping the long strand all the way around my head (good if you have a foot or two more than you need) or by adding an extra stitch or two around the braid at the base of my neck (good for shortening just a couple inches).
Yay hair ribbons!
During the summer, I've had the pleasure to mentor Michał Mandrysz, as he created an External Lightmapping Tool for Unity, as part of Unity's Summer Of Code. As of today, you can download the tool from the resources section of our website.
What is it?
A tool that lets you use 3d Studio Max to make great looking lighting for your game.
I've been making lightmaps for ages already, why would I care?
Because with this tool, you can actually lay out your scenes in Unity. Previously if you wanted to use lightmaps, you'd usually lay out your scenes in 3d Studio Max or Maya or some other tool, and would have had a hard time moving things around in Unity later on.
Do you have some examples for this?
Take a look at this video tutorial from Michał, going over the example project included with the tool.
Great. Do I need to prepare my assets in any way to make this work?
You need to provide lightmap texturecoordinates for all meshes that you want to have lightmapped. However each object can have its own seperate lightmap sheet. The tool will take all lightmap sheets from all specified objects in the scene, put them all into one mega lightmap sheet, export your scene to fbx, have Max import the fbx, have Max generate a lightmap, and then that lightmap gets picked up by Unity automatically.
Take a look at this more detailed screencast, which goes trough this process, and shows how to go from an empty project to a lightmapped environment.
But I don't use max! I use …..
There's nothing in the tool that makes the technique inherently limited to 3d Studio Max. However the tool does provide some nice extensions to Max that make the lighting baking a one click process. With a bit of effort, one could take this project, and make it work for other authoring tools.
I still have some other question
Try out the new answers.unity3d.com and get it answered!
Many thanks and congratulations from the Unity team go out to Michał for being part of the Summer of Code program. You can find more indepth info on the tool on Michal's website.
Dr. Eunsung Kan sees his concept of a closed-loop dairy farm — which reuses wastewater, emits zero waste and powers itself on manure — as the future of sustainable animal farming.
Kan, a Texas A&M AgriLife Research chemical and environmental engineer in Stephenville, Texas, said his concept could change the way dairies, swine and poultry farms deal with manure, wastewater and greenhouse gases while utilizing the waste to generate electricity.
Animal waste is a blessing and curse for dairies. Manure is sold to local farmers who need to infuse nutrients into the soil for crops and forage. However, tons of manure can also be logistically taxing as facilities keep up with the treatment and distribution of large quantities of environmentally problematic materials monitored by state and federal environmental regulators.
Farm operations have been implicated in higher-than-normal levels of nitrogen and phosphorous, antibiotics, heavy metals and hormones in surface and groundwater downstream from facilities. Manure is also a known contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, such as methane and carbon dioxide.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service estimates that manure from a dairy milking 200 cows can produce as much nitrogen as is in the sewage from a community of 5,000-10,000 people.
Kan's research would utilize existing technology such as biochar — a carbon material similar to charcoal created from animal manure and agricultural waste, such as corn stubble or rice straw — that would be used to filter solid waste and effluent. The biochar could be used as a slow-release fertilizer or converted via pyrolysis — the decomposition of organic material by heat — into energy to power the farm.
The closed-loop dairy concept focuses on three main goals: wastewater treatment using dairy manure-derived biochar, producing bioenergy using dairy manure and capturing greenhouse gases via adsorption onto dairy manure-derived biochar, Kan said.
Biochar has proved to provide a beneficial surface chemistry that can filter a wide range of contaminants, including nitrogen and phosphorous, he said. When the surface of biochar is modified with several methods in a lab, it has shown an ability to capture antibiotics, pesticides, hormones, heavy metals and other possible contaminants.
“The mission is the treatment and reuse of dairy wastewater and the conversion of dairy waste into energy to power the facility,” he said. “It focuses on providing a model for sustainable farming.”
Last year, Kan received a $1 million grant from the Texas A&M University Chancellor's Research Initiative Fund to research the viability of the closed-loop dairy system. Before joining AgriLife Research, he also received about $400,000 in research grants from the Environmental Protection Agency, USDA and the U.S. Geologic Survey to research the concept's potential to treat animal waste, control greenhouse gas emissions and convert manure to energy.
Conceptual system
The closed-loop dairy is a relatively simple concept, Kan said. Cows produce manure that, when mixed with remnants of local crops, can become a seemingly endless supply of filtering material, fertilizer and energy.
Columns filled with biochar would act as a water purification system that filters nitrogen, phosphorous and other contaminants from liquid as it passes through the material, Kan said.
“The affluent from the column would then be very low in nitrogen and phosphorous,” he said. “If we filter to low levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, it wouldn't cause any environmental problem.”
The biochar used to filter nitrogen and phosphorous could then be used as slow-release fertilizer that provides needed nutrients to plants and would not wash away as runoff during heavy rains. In addition, biochar immobilized with photocatalysts would decompose toxic contaminants to harmless products when irradiated by exposure to ultraviolet light.
For instance, Kan's study has shown that a biochar immobilized with photocatalysts completely degraded antibiotic and hormone compounds while effectively controlling pathogens. The potential for biochar's used to filter wastewater goes beyond agriculture and could be applied at any wastewater treatment plant or even to filter contaminants in the injection water used for fracking in the petroleum industry.
For energy, dairy manure would be fed into a pyrolysis reactor on site that would use relatively low heat — 500-1,000°F — to create compressed hydrogen and carbon monoxide syngas that can be used to create electric power, Kan said. Excess electricity could be sold to local utility companies. The byproduct from pyrolysis of dairy manure is biochar.
“The principle is very simple,” Kan said. “The dairy would just need a different sized reactor to meet its scale of manure output and energy needs.”
Dr. Sergio Capareda, an AgriLife Research agricultural engineer in College Station, Texas, proved the pyrolytic conversion of dairy manure to syngas and biochar from his USDA-funded project, Kan said. Kan plans to advance this concept by biologically converting syngas to butanol and bio-jet fuel as alternative transportation fuels and developing biochar-based processes for wastewater treatment and greenhouse gas control.
Several other researchers and engineers within the Texas A&M system are collaborating with Kan, and interest in the concept is growing among public institutions and private companies.
Kan will produce a lab-scale version of the closed-loop dairy to determine the necessary scale for application and experimentation at the neighboring Southwest Regional Dairy Center in Stephenville, a privately owned working dairy operated by Tarleton State University that's used for educational purposes. He hopes to have a system, including the pyrolysis reactor, operating at the dairy within three to four years.
Kan said he believes the closed-loop system will prove to be a logistically and financially viable model for dairy producers to implement in the future. He expects his pilot project at the regional dairy to produce data that will draw more interest and investment from public institutions and private companies.
Two new suspects charged in connection with Paris terror attacks
Two new suspects charged in connection with Paris terror attacks
Dozens were killed at the Bataclan theatre in November 2015
Two people have been charged on suspicion of providing fake documents to a man who helped plan the Paris terror attacks that killed 130 people.
The man and woman, named as Farid K and Meryem E.B., respectively, were arrested after a house raid in Brussels, the federal prosecutor's office said.
Farid K, who was also charged with "participation in the activities of a terrorist group", has been remanded in custody, while Meryem E.B. was released under "strict" conditions.
Prosecutors said in a statement that the pair are "suspected to have provided Khalid El Bakraoui with the false documents afterwards used in preparation of the Paris attacks".
Bataclan reopens one year after terrorists opened fire
Bakraoui blew himself up at a metro station in Brussels on 22 March last year.
In a linked attack, his brother Ibrahim and another suicide bomber attacked Brussels airport. Thirty-two people were killed.
It is believed that Bakraoui rented a safe house in the Belgian city of Charleroi that was used in preparation for the November 2015 attacks in the French capital.
He also rented an apartment under a false name in Brussels' Forest borough where police looking for Paris suspect Salah Abdeslam killed another suspected militant.
Investigators have said the same cell carried out the Paris and Brussels attacks.
In Belgium, 20 people have been charged in connection with the Paris investigation.

The only thing that saved Stephenson Canyon from development was the canyon itself. Its steep, fern-lined terrain made it too hard to clear for houses as World War II-era Bremerton boomed.
Today, it's a hidden gem in the midst of the urban neighborhoods that make up Sheridan Park. And this Saturday, we will do some exploring of this 27-acre oasis on the Kitsap Sun's latest Story Walk.
In October 1942, the recently-established Bremerton Housing Authority opened the first homes at Sheridan Park, the remnants of which you can still find there today. They put people in them so fast the electricity wasn't even working when the first tenants moved in, according to an article in the Bremerton Sun. But they could not build within the canyon, even as the population of Bremerton grew from 15,000 to 85,000 during those war years.
The US Public Housing Authority sold the canyon, and the property around it, to Bremerton in 1958, according to Bremerton parks department records. Ruth Reese, a Bremerton historian, told me that a generation of children who grew up around it took advantage of their natural surroundings, playing on its trails and giant stumps.
Later, however, it languished. People started dumping trash there. Children stopped playing and the trails seemed to attract a seedier element. But in 2008, some federal money and community projects to clean up the canyon brought the canyon back into the community fold.
Still, I have talked with some residents who feel the park is not safe, and have observed drug use there. Most disturbingly, a level 3 sex offender is accused of groping and assaulting two women on the trails in July. He remains in the Kitsap County Jail awaiting trial. (It's story no. 4 on the Bremerton Beat Blast below.)
This Story Walk aims to accomplish two things:
Learn the history and the layout of this magnificent green space, so you may enjoy it in the future; Get tips on how you can stay safe within the canyon, with help from Bremerton Police Sgt. Tim Garrity, who will speak at the walk.
Hope to see you at 1 p.m. Saturday at the city greenhouses off Birch Street. RSVP and view the rest of the details for the walk here.
LONDON: A majority of Indian students who come to the UK for higher education tend to leave at the end of their degree, according to official data released today.Between April 2016 and April 2017, as many as 7,469 Indian students left before the expiry of their student visas with only 2,209 choosing to extend their visas to remain in Britain, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) said."Thai, Chinese, Indian and North American (US) students were more likely to depart before their study visas or extensions expired, whereas Russian, Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Saudi Arabian students were more likely to extend their leave to remain," the ONS data said.It also confirms a massive drop in the number of Indians choosing the UK as a destination of choice for their university education.Indian students accounted for approximately 9,600 visas granted in 2016 (or 7 per cent), but in 2010 they accounted for around one in five of visas granted at 40,500, the figures said.The latest data coincides with results of a new exit-check system introduced in April 2015 with aim of building a more complete picture of whether those who entered the UK left when they were supposed to.It indicates that figures of students over-staying may have been inflated in the past and has prompted UK's home secretary Amber Rudd to commission a new assessment of the impact of international students on the UK economy.Rudd has directed the UK's Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to examine the impact both EU and non-EU students have on the labour market and economy whilst in the UK."There is no limit to the number of genuine international students who can come to the UK to study and the fact that we remain the second most popular global destination for those seeking higher education is something to be proud of," Rudd said in a statement."We understand how important students from around the world are to our higher education sector, which is a key export for our country, and that's why we want to have a robust and independent evidence base of their value and the impact they have," Rudd said.The move has been widely welcomed by universities and other agencies involved in attracting more overseas students to the UK's shores."London is the world's most popular city for international students drawn by our world-class universities. India is an important student market for London and we should not underestimate the value they bring to the economy," said Andrew Cooke, Acting CEO of London & Partners and Study London."Our analysis shows that India represents the fourth largest student population in the capital, contributing 130 million pounds in spend to the UK economy. It is vital that international students continue to feel welcome in our city and we look forward to helping more Indian students wanting to study in London," Cooke said.It is also hoped that the latest MAC assessment, due to report by September 2018, will add pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May to remove student figures from the overall annual migration data."This is an opportunity to build on the considerable evidence that shows that international students have a very positive impact on the UK economy and local communities," said Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK.MAC has been asked to examine the impact of tuition fees and other spending by international students on the local and national economy, as well as the role students play in contributing to economic growth and the quality of education for domestic students.The UK is the second most popular destination for international students, with four UK universities in the world's top 10.But university chiefs have been warning of a fall in its popularity due to a perception that the country's visa policies make it an unwelcome destination.
OXFORD, Mississippi --- Ole Miss used a big first inning that featured a five-run, two-out rally to jump out of the gates and never looked back in an 11-5 victory over Arkansas-Little Rock on Saturday.
The Rebels (13-2) and Trojans (8-4) will close out the series at 1:30 p.m. Sunday at Swayze Field.
The bottom of the lineup provided the pop for Ole Miss on Saturday, going a combined 7-for-13 among starters with nine RBI. Preston Overbey led the way, going 3-for-4 with two runs scored and three RBI.
Aaron Greenwood (1-0) picked up the win in relief, entering the game in the fifth inning to replace starter Christian Trent. Greenwood worked 1.1 innings, allowing only two hits with a walk and three strikeouts. Trent worked 4.2 innings, allowing five runs on six hits with a walk and six strikeouts. It's the first walk for Trent in 24 innings of work this season.
Ethan Schlechte (1-1) took the loss for UALR, allowing six runs on eight hits with two walks through 1.2 innings of work in the start.
"It was one of those days that you just had a feeling that there was going to be offense," said Ole Miss head coach Mike Bianco. "We were amazing in the first inning. It all happened with two outs. They get the first two guys and then (Austin) Anderson gets a base hit. Last night we talked with the team about how someone has to break the ice. (Preston) Overbey had a tremendous day. He had had three two-out RBIs. That's huge. After he got that, it kind of broke the ice. Hitting is contagious and it certainly was today."
Ole Miss broke things open in the first inning with a two-out rally that started with a single and a double from Austin Anderson and Will Allen, respectively. Sikes Orvis walked to load the bases before Overbey then delivered a two-RBI double to left center. Brantley Bell followed it up with a two-RBI single before Errol Robinson would notch an RBI single to right to cap the scoring and give the Rebels a 5-0 lead after the first inning of play.
A sixth run came home in the second inning when Overbey delivered an RBI single with two outs, bringing home Anderson and giving Ole Miss the 6-0 lead.
UALR responded with a four-run fourth inning, using an RBI-single from Justin Steelmon and a three-run home run from Bryson Thionnet to cut the lead to 6-4.
Ole Miss pushed it back out to 7-4 in the home half of the inning with an RBI-double to right center from Will Allen that pushed Anderson across the plate for the third time on the afternoon.
Again, UALR had an answer when Ben Crumpton scored on a double from Tanner Rockwell. Crumpton was hit by a pitch before a sac bunt moved him into scoring position for the Rockwell it. The lead stood at 7-5 for the Rebels at the middle of the fifth.
Will Jamison then hit a solo shot in the bottom of the fifth to take the lead back out to 8-5.
Ole Miss extended its lead in the seventh with a three-run inning thanks to RBI from Jamison, Robinson and Braxton Lee. With two men on, Jamison delivered a single through the right side to bring home the first run in Overbey while Bell moved to third. Robinson then lay down a bunt down the first baseline, bringing home Bell on the sacrifice play. Lee then hit a ball deep to short, bringing home Jamison from second while Lee beat out the throw to first for the third run in the inning.
The lead stood at 11-5 at the end of the seventh and would hold as Hawtin Buchanan and Austin Blunt kept the Trojans off the bases through the final two innings.

Earlier this month, Anne Rice announced that she was stopping being a Christian – but that she wouldn't give up Christ. Does this make sense? Can you have one without the other? Could you cling to the prophet and abandon Islam? More generally, should anyone be held responsible for the crimes of their co-believers? Should they hold themselves responsible?
It may be that the answer for Christians and for other religions is "yes", they can and should. Monotheistic religions aren't just matters of personal preference, but of collective effort. They command the believers to build a better society. So do many forms of atheism. So if the building turns out to be slaughterhouse, or a jail, perhaps it's right to leave the work crew. But must you then repudiate the ideals that you have seen betrayed?
Whatever it is that Anne Rice sees in the figure of Christ is the same thing as fuels her revulsion from her fellow Christians. So, how to deal with the problem?
Monday's response
John Richardson: I can understand Rice's position. But her desire to set herself apart, I would argue, owes a lot to pride
Wednesday response
Rebecca Jenkins: Christians are just like other people: envious, fearful, resentful and way-too inclined to tear into others rather question ourselves
Friday's response
Theo Hobson: There is no recognized position of 'non-institutional Christian'. But there ought to be one
Saturday's response
Shirley Lancaster: We need to rediscover spirituality as an interior journey and this will involve new institutional forms

It was not *that* difficult to request for a 30-minute interview with him. We sent our first 4 thesis chapters almost 2 months ahead which meant we had to be VERY advanced in class. We also sent our profiles for background check knowing how security can be very tight.
We got our first rejection from his secretary who said he can't forward it since the proposed date was a week before Christmas. We pleaded that he still forward it to Mayor and let him decide. We got our yes!
We were inserted between a meeting with a governor and his attendance to the AFP/PNP Christmas Party, but the 30-minute interview was extended to another hour (by him), and here's what we learned from that enriching experience:
1. He's the first Bisaya mayor of Davao City. The city was once governed by feudal lords from Luzon who had no interest on the welfare of locals.
2. Almost half of his grandchildren are Muslims. No wonder he's the only one among the presidentiables who understands the plight of the Moros.
3. “Media portrays me sometimes badly.” Accdg to Mayor, Zabriskie, the writer who started to call him “The Punisher”, interviewed him for an article on Mindanao being a troubled land. He was shocked when the write-up turned out to be mostly about him. Media ethics, anyone?
4. There is this concept of sidewalk sharing in Davao City. 1/3 for vendors, 2/3 for pedestrians.
5. Most “only in Davao” laws implemented were inspired by his Mom's house rules
a. Smoking ban
b. Firecracker ban
c. Midnight curfew for nightclubs and bars (“Sabi ng nanay ko, mag-inom tayo pero matulog tayo nang maaga.”) 😆
6. The “girlfriends” are a myth. “Biro lang yun. You have to concede to me a certain amount of humor.”
This all happened before the presidency chaos. I could add more to this list to show you how he is just like the rest of us, or even better. When asked how his leadership is different from the rest, he didn't say “walang rape, walang massacre, etc” (like what his extreme supporters are banking on) but he just said
“I take my oath seriously. I don't even use the word ‘official'. I'm just a government employee doing what I'm supposed to do – protect public interest, maintain order.”
How about you? How raw and real is your president?
Bonus: His favorite actress is Demi Moore 😊

In a lengthy manifesto, former LAPD officer Christopher Dorner attempts to explain the core of his violent actions. Throughout the manifesto, he references racism, disappointment, and revenge. He explains his well-to-do upbringing, where he was only one of two African-American students in his elementary class. He also explains his first encounter with racism in the first grade. Then he goes into what brought him to where he is today — a runaway fugitive who is wanted for murdering the daughter and future son-in-law of a retired LAPD captain who sat on the board that terminated him for reporting the unethical acts of another officer and for shooting three LAPD officers, killing one.
According to a study conducted by Lorena Estrada-Martinez, assistant professor at the Brown School at Washington University in St. Louis, different types of stress, particularly from racial discrimination, can influence the risk for violent behaviors and depressive symptoms in African-American young adults. “African-American youth who were at greatest risk for engaging in violent behaviors while transitioning into adulthood were those who experienced higher levels of racial discrimination in addition to general daily stressors. Contrary to expectations, stress that stemmed from financial shortage and neighborhood stress were not associated with the risk of violent behaviors during emerging adulthood,” Estrada-Martinez says. Assuming his manifesto is truthful, is it safe to assume that years of discrimination may have caught up with Dorner?
Read excerpts from his manifesto below (officers' names were removed out of respect for their privacy):
On the racist culture of the LAPD: […] The department has not changed since the Rampart and Rodney King days. It has gotten worse. The consent decree should never have been lifted. The only thing that has evolved from the consent decree is those officers involved in the Rampart scandal and Rodney King incidents have since promoted to supervisor, commanders, and command staff, and executive positions. On being called a n*gger by a fellow officer/co-worker: […] The sad thing about this incident was that when Detective XXXX from internal affairs investigated this incident only (1) officer (unknown) in the van other than myself had statements constistent [sic] with what actually happened. The other six officers all stated they heard nothing and saw nothing. Shame on every one of you. Shame on Detective XXXX (same ethnicity as XXXX) for creating a separate 1.28 formal complaint against me (XXXX complaint) in retaliation for initiating the complaint against XXXX and XXXX. Don't retaliate against honest officers for breaking your so-called blue line. I hope your son XXXX, who I knew, is a better officer than you, Detective XXXX. The saddest part of this ordeal was that Officer XXXX and XXXX were only given 22 day suspensions and are still LAPD officers to this day. That day, the LAPD stated that it is acceptable for fellow officers to call black officers n*ggers to their face and you will receive a slap on the wrist. Even sadder is that during that 22 day suspension XXXX and XXXX received is that the LAPPL (Los Angeles Police Protective League) paid the officers their salaries while they were suspended. When I took a two-day suspension for an accidental discharge, I took my suspension and never applied for a league salary. Its called integrity. On his first encounter with racism: […] Find any incidents where I was ever accused of being a bully. You won't, because it doesn't exist. It's not in my DNA. Never was. I was the only black kid in each of my elementary school classes from first grade to seventh grade in junior high and any instances where I was disciplined for fighting was in response to fellow students provoking common childhood schoolyard fights, or calling me a n*gger or other derogatory racial names. I grew up in neighborhoods where blacks make up less than 1%. My first recollection of racism was in the first grade at Norwalk Christian elementary school in Norwalk, CA. A fellow student, XXXX if I can recall, called me a n*gger on the playground. My response was swift and non-lethal. I struck him fast and hard with a punch an kick. He cried and reported it to a teacher. The teacher reported it to the principal. The principal swatted XXXX for using a derogatory word toward me. On the LAPD victimizing minorities: […] Terminating officers because they expose a culture of lying, racism (from the academy), and excessive use of force will immediately change. PSB can not police their own and that has been proven. The blue line will forever be severed and a cultural change will be implanted. You have awoken a sleeping giant. I am here to change and make policy. The culture of LAPD versus the community and honest/good officers needs to and will change. I am here to correct and calibrate your morale compasses to true north. Those Caucasian officers who join South Bureau divisions (77th,SW,SE, an Harbor) with the sole intent to victimize minorities who are uneducated, and unaware of criminal law, civil law, and civil rights. You prefer the South bureau because a use of force/deadly force is likely and the individual you use UOF on will likely not report it. You are a high value target. Those Black officers in supervisory ranks and pay grades who stay in south bureau (even though you live in the valley or OC) for the sole intent of getting retribution toward subordinate caucasians officers for the pain and hostile work environment their elders inflicted on you as probationers (P-1′s) and novice P-2's. You are a high value target. You perpetuated the cycle of racism in the department as well. You breed a new generation of bigoted caucasian officer when you belittle them and treat them unfairly. His warning to LAPD officers: […] No one grows up and wants to be a cop killer. It was against everything I've ever was. As a young police explorer I found my calling in life. But, As a young police officer I found that the violent suspects on the street are not the only people you have to watch. It is the officer who was hired on to the department (pre-2000) before polygraphs were standard for all new hires and a substantial vetting in a backround investigation. […] Suppressing the truth will leave to deadly consequences for you and your family. There will be an element of surprise where you work, live, eat, and sleep. I will utilize ISR at your home, workplace, and all locations in between. I will utilize OSINT to discover your residences, spouses workplaces, and children's schools. IMINT to coordinate and plan attacks on your fixed locations. Its amazing whats on NIPR. HUMINT will be utilized to collect personal schedules of targets. I never had the opportunity to have a family of my own, I'm terminating yours. XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and BOR members Look your wives/husbands and surviving children directly in the face and tell them the truth as to why your children are dead. […] The Violence of action will be HIGH. I am the reason TAC alert was established. I will bring unconventional and asymmetrical warfare to those in LAPD uniform whether on or off duty.
This is no attempt to support the violent actions of Dorner; however, this is an attempt to open the floor for conversation about racism and its damaging affects. If America does not discuss racism head-on, society will continue to cultivate more Chris Dorner's. Racism brings forth feelings of anguish, betrayal, and frustration. Anyone who has frequently been on the receiving end of racial discrimination has felt like Dorner at one point and time. Fortunately, most victims of racial discrimination have managed to exert their frustrations in a non-violent/non-life threatening manner, but the more we continue to pretend as if racism does not exist, the more violence will erupt.

Do you believe Dorner's actions are the result of racism?

The Education Secretary has insisted that there should not be a public inquiry into a possible cover-up of paedophile politicians in Westminster, after it emerged that more than 100 Home Office files related to historic allegations of child abuse have gone “missing”.
Lord Tebbit, who served in the Cabinet under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, said today that there “may well have been” a political cover-up in order to “protect the establishment” of the time.
The files, which related to a 20-year period between 1979 and 1999, were flagged up as part of an internal Home Office review into a dossier, prepared by Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens, alleging paedophile activity at Westminster in the 10980s.

Mark Sedwill, the permanent secretary at the Home Office, revealed the documents were “presumed destroyed, missing or not found”, as he said that a fresh internal review under a “senior legal figure outside the Home Office” would be launched.
But when asked if the “toxic idea that politicians have been hiding this for a long time” meant a public inquiry was needed, Michael Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that he disagreed.
He said that specific concerns should be brought to the police, and that “the due process of law” must be allowed to pursue those who “may or may not be guilty of crimes”.
Mr Gove said: “I think it is important both that we analyse what has happened in the past when a different culture prevailed, but also it is really important that we ensure that those who are keeping children safe now - teachers and social workers - are supported.”
Speaking on the same programme, Lord Tebbit said that there was a view at the time, since “spectacularly shown to be wrong”, that “if a few things had gone wrong here and there that it was more important to protect the system than to delve too far into them”.
Asked if he thought there had been a “big political cover-up” at the time, he said: “I think there may well have been. But it was almost unconscious. It was the thing that people did at that time.”
Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said that he did not rule out a wider inquiry but he made clear that the ongoing police investigations would have to take precedence.
“I assume any additional inquiries wouldn't be able to second guess or even look into the matters which the police are looking into already,” he told the BBC's Sunday Politics programme.
Alison Millar from law firm Leigh Day which representing some of the victims of alleged child abuse, said it was now “an absolute necessity” that there was an independent inquiry into alleged abuse within Westminster.
She said: “This cannot be another internal review held by those who may well be at fault, it will only fuel a growing suspicion amongst the electorate that there is a conspiracy over the abuse of children by those with great power.”
“To be relevant, and effective, any independent inquiry needs to create a safe environment for survivors of abuse to come forward so their voices can be heard. At the moment the allegations are so serious. and go so far up in the Government, to make many survivors fear for their safety.”

After Pat Robertson asserted that Haiti had been hit by yesterday's devastating earthquake because of a pact with the devil--which, according to Hatian lore, was made in 1791 by leaders of a slave revolt in exchange for victory over the French--Christian Broadcasting Network responded to some of the controversy with a clarifying statement: that Robertson has shown compassion toward the people of Haiti, that he never said the earthquake was God's wrath, and that "this history [the legend of the Devil pact], combined with the horrible state of the country, has led countless scholars and religious figures over the centuries to believe the country is cursed." Here's the statement from CBN spokesman Chris Roslan:
On today's The 700 Club, during a segment about the devastation, suffering and humanitarian effort that is needed in Haiti, Dr. Robertson also spoke about Haiti's history. His comments were based on the widely-discussed 1791 slave rebellion led by Boukman Dutty at Bois Caiman, where the slaves allegedly made a famous pact with the devil in exchange for victory over the French. This history, combined with the horrible state of the country, has led countless scholars and religious figures over the centuries to believe the country is cursed. Dr. Robertson never stated that the earthquake was God's wrath. If you watch the entire video segment, Dr. Robertson's compassion for the people of Haiti is clear. He called for prayer for them. His humanitarian arm has been working to help thousands of people in Haiti over the last year, and they are currently launching a major relief and recovery effort to help the victims of this disaster. They have sent a shipment of millions of dollars worth of medications that is now in Haiti, and their disaster team leaders are expected to arrive tomorrow and begin operations to ease the suffering.

Astronomers are puzzled by the latest images captured by NASA's Dawn spacecraft. They show that there are two spots on Ceres that are much brighter than the rest of the dwarf planet's rocky and pockmarked terrain.
The probe is due to enter Ceres' orbit on March 6. It has already begunsending back the first photosof the dwarf planet that NASA has snapped since 2004. Back then, pictures from the Hubble Telescope showed a white area. Later, photos revealed that the white area is really a bright spot. Now scientists say there is a second, slightly dimmer, yet still noticeably bright spot next to the first…and they don't know what's causing them.
"Ceres' bright spot can now be seen to have a companion of lesser brightness, but apparently in the same basin. This may be pointing to a volcano-like origin of the spots, but we will have to wait for better resolution before we can make such geologic interpretations," Chris Russell, principal investigator for the Dawn mission, based at the University of California, Los Angeles, said in a NASA statement.
The photos were taken on February 19, from a distance of about 29,000 miles. They are part of a series taken as Dawn observed Ceres completing one full rotation ‒ one of the dwarf planet's days, which lasts about nine hours.
"The brightest spot continues to be too small to resolve with our camera, but despite its size it is brighter than anything else on Ceres. This is truly unexpected and still a mystery to us," said Andreas Nathues, lead investigator for the framing camera team at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Gottingen, Germany.
The Dawn probe is set to begin a 16-month study of Ceres, the largest body in our solar system's main asteroid belt, which floats between Mars and Jupiter. The dwarf planet has an average diameter of 590 miles (950 kilometers).
The images Dawn sends back will give scientists better and better views of Ceres. Researchers hope to gain a deeper understanding of its origin and evolution by studying its surface, including the mysterious bright spots.
“So what could the bright spots be, other than alien castaways signaling at us with flashlights?” Chris Taylor of Mashable asked.
Ceres is a water-heavy object believed to contain a large amount of ice. However, ice would reflect more than 40 percent of all light hitting it ‒ meaning the current amount of reflection that scientists have measured doesn't add up. The difference may be accounted for by the resolution limit of Dawn's camera at this distance, Taylor reported. He added that salt patches or ice volcanoes are other potential causes of the glowing dots.
Images sent back to NASA in January were only 80 percent of Hubble's resolution from over a decade ago, but new photos will be clearer as the probe gets closer to the dwarf planet.
Ceres falls into the same category of dwarf planets as Pluto. The classification, according to the International Astronomical Union, is for a celestial body that “is in orbit around the sun” and “has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape,” but is not able to “clear the neighborhood around its orbit.”
Four McDonald's locations in the South Bay resumed testing out Gilroy's famous garlic fries on Tuesday, after the worldwide restaurant chain had to temporarily stop because of a shortage of scrumptious ingredients. Stephanie Chuang reports. (Published Tuesday, May 17, 2016)
Four McDonald's locations in the South Bay resumed testing out Gilroy's famous garlic fries on Tuesday, after the worldwide restaurant chain had to temporarily stop because of a shortage of scrumptious ingredients.
The two-week hiatus left customers with their mouths watering. But McDonald's was able to secure more potatoes, garlic, parsley and Parmesan cheese and spices to resume offering the treat, the company first debuted on May 3. The garlic in the new Gilroy Garlic Fries is grown at the family-owned Christopher Ranch in Gilroy, the largest garlic production operation in the country.
Paul Sigafoos of San Jose tried them on Tuesday. "A little more garlic would be nice," he said. "But it's OK. It's very good."
Lorne Gordon of San Jose said that he likes Gilroy garlic, but he's not sure if the flavor would be too much for McDonald's customers.
Right now they are only available at four McDonald's locations in the South Bay.
3509 Homested Road in Santa Clara
2191 Monterey Road in San Jose
1398 West San Carlos Street in San Jose
4838 San Felipe Road in San Jose
If the fries are a success, the fast food chain will make them available at nearly 250 McDonald's restaurants across the Bay Area.
The 8 Philippine airports the DOTr bragged of getting a rating for punctuality are actually among the bottom 35 of almost 500 major airports worldwide
Published 3:45 PM, November 19, 2017
Not all starred ratings point to a stellar performance.
On Friday, November 19, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) proudly released the results of the latest Official Aviation Guide (OAG) rankings of airports' punctuality worldwide.
"GOOD NEWS: 8 PH airports awarded with On-Time Performance Star Ratings," the DOTr boasted through a press statement mailed to the media and posted on their Facebook page.
The Transportation Department failed to include, however, that all the Philippine airports listed garnered only one-star ratings, which means they were among the least punctual in the world.
In their press release, they only attached the list of one-star airports, omitting hundreds of others with higher ratings (2 stars to 5 stars).
Therefore, the government said Iloilo International Airport was "ranked 14th place" – when in fact, it was ranked 455th.
Out of 489 airports ranked, the 8 Philippine airports are in the bottom 35:
Iloilo International Airport
Ninoy Aquino International Airport
Bacolod-Silay Airport
Davao International Airport
Tacloban Airport
Laguindingan International Airport
Kalibo International Airport
Puerto Princesa International Airport
Below the rankings, the OAG explains their rating system: "The Star Ratings range from one to five stars. Airlines and airports with the best on-time performance, for example, the top 10%, receive five stars. The awards are then distributed, across all airlines with the poorest performers receiving one star."
Reached for comment, the DOTr, in a statement, pointed to a silver lining.
They said that 2017 is the first year that Philippine airports made it to the list. To be included, airports must have a minimum of 600 operations a month (minimum of 2.5 million departed seats), and OAG must receive flight status information of at least 80% of scheduled flights within a year. (READ: NAIA no longer among 'worst airports' – survey)
"[We are] hoping by next year we will reach category 2 [stars] as our airports are now being improved by DOTr both operations, service, and infrastructures," their statement read.
Communications officer Goddess Libiran also told Rappler in a text message that they are reminded by a rallying call by their Secretary Arthur Tugade.
"We know that there's a lot to do. We will not rest until we become one of the better airports, and soon, best," she said. – Rappler.com

Companies in this article GameStop
Over the past few weeks there have been a number of articles appearing on websites across the globe fearing the concept that Sony and Microsoft are going to use, as GamesIndustry International itself put it, "the Nuclear Option" by blocking the ability to play used games on their next generation of hardware. Without fail, each and every one of these articles seems to take a damning view of this concept; even industry "analysts" like Michael Pachter have weighed in on what cost this would have to first party and third parties alike and how it would damage the industry, going as far as labeling the concept "evil". In truth it is nothing of the sort and what each and every article fails to account for is the REAL cost of used games.
I've been in this industry for 25 years, I've run development (internal and external) for seven different publishers. Used games were never, have never, been an issue to any of them. Today that actually still holds true; publishers don't hate used games, but they do hate the practices of GameStop and those that followed to force used games upon their customers - if you want to hear about nuclear options, GameStop fired theirs first. A colleague of mine brought to light how bad this has become just the other week. He went into his local GameStop and was point blank REFUSED the option of buying the game he went to get new. After pressuring the sales assistant for a few minutes he finally got his new game - but only after the assistant got his manager's approval to sell it to him. That's the state of retail today, and it's not healthy for the consumer at all.
The real cost of used games is the damage that is being wrought on the creativity and variety of games available to the consumer, and it's directly a result of these practices. Developers and publishers alike now spend many hours working on constructs, systems and game design elements to try and eliminate the churn of a game. Whether this be online passes, copious amounts of DLC, or gating mechanisms, one thing is for sure - it doesn't benefit the consumer. Do I really want to have to type in a token code when I buy a game? No, you've just added annoyance and friction to my experience. But more to the point - do I really want talented studios spending their time designing and implementing this rather than polishing the game? No, I really don't. But there's a much bigger, much more expensive way of trying to stop churn and it's the one that everyone has flooded to.
"The real cost of used games has been the destruction of the mid-tier publisher and the elimination of many an independent development studio" Richard Browne
The real cost of used games is the death of single player gaming. How do I stop churn? I implement multiplayer and attempt to keep my disc with my consumer playing online against their friends. It works wonderfully for Call of Duty - no doubt it can work wonderfully for me. The problem is, at what cost? Countless millions of dollars would be the answer. Let's take a great example, one of my favorite game series released on this generation - Uncharted. What on Earth was the point of taking the completely single player experience of Uncharted 1 and bolting on an entirely new game to Nathan Drake's second adventure? The multiplayer game (brilliantly executed as one would expect of the Naughty Dog team) had absolutely nothing to do with the single player experience, and from my perspective had absolutely zero interest from me as a consumer, and I'm not alone in that. I hate to think what it cost to make, refine, balance and tune - but I can guarantee it added a whole lot of zeroes to the budget, and made the P&L look a lot more challenging. And it's all aimed at stopping the game churn. Now a lot of people probably derived a lot of enjoyment out of it, and in Uncharted's case it seemed to have no material effect on the quality of the single player experience - but I'd say Uncharted is most certainly the outlier in this because few people have the resources of Sony and Naughty Dog.
The real cost of used games? Take a look at the most recent Ninja Gaiden game. Why does that multiplayer mode exist? What effect did having to build it have on the single player experience? There is no reason for the multiplayer game to exist; it makes no sense in NG's universe. No doubt, the budget and resources for the team weren't massively extended when the request for multiplayer was added, so it absolutely must have materially impacted the people building the core game. I'm not singling out Ninja Gaiden here, as the number of games that have gone the same route over the past couple of years is substantial. But is it good for the consumer? Absolutely not - in general they're getting a poorer single player game. But again that's the tip of the iceberg.
The real cost of used games? Let's take someone like Tim Schafer. Tim works his genius in the video game medium primarily through selling fantastic stories in fantastic worlds, and primarily these experiences are single player games. Tim walks into publisher X and puts his latest, greatest piece of work on the table with a decent mid-range budget. It doesn't stand a chance. What you'll hear in response to that is that publishers are too risk averse. This simply isn't the case; publishers have to deal with P&Ls in reality, and they know the minute that pitch has finished that Tim's game will sell a few hundred thousand copies and then get endlessly churned. In the end, Tim has gone on to write smaller games, digitally delivered and is now using Kickstarter to fund his latest and greatest product and I think that's fantastic. Do I think it's fantastic that I'll no longer be able to buy another Brutal Legend style Tim Schafer game? No I don't. Is that beneficial to the consumer? Absolutely not.
The real cost of used games? The variety of games out there is shrinking. Existing franchises that have been successful on a single player formula are being redesigned out of their element to introduce multiplayer features. Resident Evil is now a tactical shooter. Resident. Evil. Some single player games naturally have been launched with great success in the past year or two; Rockstar have had such fortune with Red Dead Redemption and LA Noire. Both these games take a different tact to combat churn - they're absolutely huge and take weeks to complete. Guess what? Making those games was extraordinarily expensive. The risk for the publisher on such products is enormous. So we now have a situation where risk is being eliminated from a publisher's purview. You simply cannot afford risk, since the console business has become a complete hit or miss scenario where hits are well rewarded but misses are potentially crippling. Is less choice and less variety of software beneficial to the consumer? Absolutely not.
"I hope and would actively encourage Microsoft and Sony to embrace the 'Nuclear Option' and put an end to this" Richard Browne
The real cost of used games has been the destruction of the mid-tier publisher and the elimination of many an independent development studio who in the past conducted work in that space. With next generation budgets leaping yet again only the 'mini-publishers' - such as Epic, Insomniac, Bungie - can possibly survive externally to an actual publisher. Beneficial to the customer? No.
The rebuttal of course is usually the same. Used games fuel new game sales; this is GameStop's response and some buy into it. Of course, in reality it's pure conjecture without any evidence. If used game trading fueled new game sales then when used game trade-ins became the new standard a few years ago new games sales should have spiked. Of course they didn't; in fact game sales have stayed mostly flat or actually declined. The causation of that is primarily because not only is the GameStop line a complete fallacy, there's actually a worse truth, which is game churning isn't a one-off second hand thing but a multiple of a multiple. New game gets returned for used game which gets returned for used game which gets returned for used game. It's not like GameStop is pushing new game sales when I bring the first game back. They push enough pre-orders of new software to satisfy their churn on used.
I was a student once, albeit briefly - I was certainly a kid once - and when I bought a game the value of it to me was far more than the disposable entertainment construct that surrounds games today. I played those games to death. Because the second rebuttal is that without trade-ins people can't afford games. But you know what? I've grown up, and so has a large part of our user base. We don't necessarily sell to "kids" anymore. We sell a lot of products to adults with decent disposable income - people who will find a way to buy Skyrim, Saints Row : The Third, Assassin's Creed, Battlefield 3, Batman and Call of Duty in November. Look at the numbers, they did. As for the kids, well, those over 17 will find a way too.
So personally I hope and would actively encourage Microsoft and Sony to embrace the "Nuclear Option" and put an end to this. Give us no used games, give us digital access to software on the day it launches to retail. I don't think we'll see even a minor drop in sales; in fact, I think we'll see it rise. Oh and don't worry either of you, I'll buy my Durango or Orbis from Amazon.com, Sony.com or Microsoft.com if I have to.
At least 30 people have been killed and scores wounded in an attack at Yemen's Ministry of Defence.
A suicide bomber detonated a car laden with explosives at a gate to the compound, in the centre of the capital Sanaa.
Armed assailants then stormed the complex, targeting a hospital inside. Foreign medical staff are reported to be among the casualties.
Security forces regained control of the site following a gun battle.
The Ministry of Defence said in a statement that most of the attackers had been killed or detained.
No group has claimed responsibility for storming the defence ministry.
Yemen's President Mansur Hadi visited the site in the wake of the attack.
US-allied Yemen has been grappling with a security threat from al-Qaeda-linked militants who have repeatedly attacked government officials and sites over the last two years.
Police officers have extraordinarily difficult jobs, and go to work each day knowing there is a chance they might not return home to their families and loved ones.
Any cop will tell you there is no such thing as a “routine” traffic stop. When an officer pulls a car over and walks up to the driver's side window, he or she never quite knows what may happen next.

That said, the officer who pulled ex-UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones over in Albuquerque, N.M., last week for allegedly drag racing allowed a situation to escalate far beyond what it should have.
Jones was needlessly belligerent, and under no circumstances should he have called the cop “a [expletive] liar.” Having escaped a potentially disastrous situation a little less than a year ago, when a car he was driving ran a red light and hit another vehicle that happened to be driven by a pregnant woman, Jones should be wise enough to try not to draw needless attention to himself.
Jones has a rematch with his arch-rival, Daniel Cormier, scheduled for April 23 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas that is set to be the main event of UFC 197. It will be his opportunity to regain the title that was stripped from him after his hit-and-run last year.
Incredibly, Jones was also pulled over in February for driving without a license, proof of registration or insurance.
All of this was entirely preventable by Jones.
That said, the situation turned ugly, and the video of an angry Jones sneering and cursing at the officer who made the stop turned up on TMZ largely because of the officer's attitude.
The police officer involved could easily have de-escalated the situation, but chose to banter back and forth with Jones.

Put yourself in Jones' shoes for a second: You've already lost a lot after the 2015 traffic accident. You were ticketed for the driving without a license charge, you have a major event in your personal life coming up and now you're being given five tickets you don't believe you deserve.
It's probably not fair to say most, but many drivers would be irritated and snap at the officer.
And the odds of that happening would increase if the officer acted smug and continued to make smart remarks.
Jones was ticketed for drag racing; revving his engine and making unnecessary engine noise; a loud exhaust; driving outside of his traffic lane; and having his license plate holder obscure the registration sticker on his plate.
Curiously, he wasn't ticketed for speeding even though the officer tells Jones he saw him speed away from a stop light with another card.
The video doesn't show the incident, so it's impossible to know whose account of what happened is correct.
When the officer ran Jones' plate, he knew who he was dealing with. Jones is a major celebrity in Albuquerque and be sure that the city's police officers know him very well.
The officer also would have seen Jones' record. Jones had a DUI conviction in New York in 2012 and the accident in Albuquerque last year.
Jones, 28, has made a point of talking publicly about his sobriety. He said prior to becoming sober in the last few months, he hadn't been sober since he was 17.
In the video, he did not appear to be under the influence of either alcohol or drugs, and the officer let him drive away after issuing the tickets. Given the way the officer was acting toward him, had he smelled as much as a drop of alcohol on Jones' breath, he wouldn't have let Jones drive away.
Jones, who was driving a Corvette, claimed he simply revved his engine to acknowledge some fans. It would behoove him to learn to smile and wave to acknowledge his fans, but to ticket him for an engine rev seems quite petty.
If the officer had been quiet during the stop and had spoken only when necessary, it probably wouldn't have been as heated. An angry Jones at one point rhetorically asked the officer, “How do you sleep with yourself?”

Clearly, it was a statement the officer should have ignored. But he said like a smart aleck, “Mostly on my left side. Sometimes on my back.”
That kind of response is almost guaranteed to raise the tension level, which, of course, it did.
The officer also said to Jones, “You're lucky you're not going to jail tonight for reckless driving.” Given we don't have all the facts, maybe that is true.
It doesn't, however, help to defuse the tension. The cop would have been far better off to simply remain silent and not have engaged with Jones. The officer is the one with the training and the one in control.
He's also in charge and doesn't need to get into petty exchanges with Jones.
When Jones said, “You're despicable,” the officer replied, “I feel the same way about you, sir.” Jones then followed up by saying, “Pig. You disgust me.” And the officer said, “Once again, the feeling is mutual.”
Jones has to be responsible for his own driving, and it's beyond time that he found a solution to the issue. The most obvious solution is to hire a driver, or take an Uber or a cab wherever he goes.
As it stands, he's only asking for trouble getting behind the wheel, particularly in Albuquerque.
Still, had the officer just remained mostly quiet and spoken only when he needed to explain something to Jones, it might not have been an incident that would have made much, if any, news.
Now, of course, it's everywhere.
Jon Jones is not only an adult, but a very lucky man. He's lucky he didn't kill anyone in his DUI in New York in 2012. He's luckier that the pregnant woman suffered mostly minor injuries in his accident in 2015. And he's lucky he's got his job back with the UFC, an opportunity to win the championship and make many millions of dollars.
He's risking all of that each time he sits in the driver's seat of a car, and it's high time he realizes it.
But the traffic officer certainly made matters worse in this case. He seemed to bait Jones, and Jones took the bait.
The officer clearly wanted to let him know who was the boss. And it led to a lot of unnecessary trouble and expense.
This was something that could have, and should have been avoided.
By Mr. Jones.
And yes, by the police officer, as well.
It's general election time in the United Kingdom, and citizens there are hearing different promises from politicians across the political spectrum. There's one particular politician, however, with whom we cannot agree on a particular issue: Leader of UKIP (United Kingdom Independence Party) Nigel Farage wants to cancel Doctor Who.
According to the Independent, "the BBC should be 'cut back to the bone' and stop producing popular entertainment programming, Nigel Farage has said."
This means if Farage and UKIP have their way, BBC broadcasts could be reduced to "local news coverage, arts programmes and religious broadcasts."
The British Broadcasting System, producer of Doctor Who, has been making soap operas, sitcoms and science fiction since it started airing its own programming in 1932. The BBC is a public broadcasting company, one that every person in the U.K. with a television pays for via annual licensing fees; currently, it costs £145.50 a year for a color TV license.
Farage's reason to cancel Doctor Who, Sherlock, Call the Midwife and even the classic soap EastEnders? It would reduce licensing fees to a mere £50 a year (also, we suspect, because he wants to kill fun).
The U.K. election for the 56th Parliament will take place on May 7, 2015. May the best candidate who doesn't want to stab our favorite Time Lord in the hearts win.

Ten years ago, Ducati caused a flurry of interest in the custom world with its International Design Contest. The winner was an unknown young German designer called Jens vom Brauck, with a stunning concept called ‘Flat Red.'
Jens then built Flat Red for real, and the bike launched his company JvB-Moto onto the European custom scene. He's now an established builder with a string of stark, brutal-looking machines to his name. A few days ago, at the Glemseck café racer festival in Germany, Jens revealed Flat Red II—and here it is.
It's based on a Ducati Monster 1100, and sports an aluminum tank with a carbon cover. The emphasis was on saving weight—the bike hits the scales at just 150 kg, but packs a cool 100 bhp, thanks to a custom exhaust and a Termignoni ECU.
Flat Red II is no show pony: there's Öhlins suspension all-round, and forged OZ wheels help to reduce weight still further. The swingarm is a modified Monster 696 item that conceals a compact li-ion battery. The brake fluid reservoirs are now located inside the top yoke, in place of the usual handlebar rubber mountings.
Hand-made aluminum parts are everywhere, from the oil cooler housing to the air intake to the front fender. The rear fender and headlight surround are carbon fiber, and the electrics are hidden within the shell of the new tank.
At Glemseck, Jens wheeled the Monster onto the sprint track and won the international class, beating British racers Guy Martin and Connor Cummins, and German pro racer Nina Prinz. “The bike goes like hell!” Jens reports. “It's light and low, and could beat more powerful 4-cylinder bikes on the eighth-mile distance. Great fun!”
Flat Red II was a commission, but it'll be the last of its type. “It's a one-off,” Jens says firmly.
A shame, but you can get an additional fix of Jens' work in our archives—and stay in touch with JvB-Moto news via Facebook.

Advertisement Man wins $40K in federal court after arrest in connection with deputy recording Sebastian County sheriff says policy put in place after judgement Share Copy Link Copy
In February 2013, Braden Purcell was walking through his Fort Smith, Arkansas, neighborhood when he saw what appeared to be police raiding a home.Purcell said he grabbed his phone to send a picture to his girlfriend.Watch the exclusive report from Brett Rains here. "I took the picture thinking this looks cool, you know?" Purcell said.Purcell said he was then approached by a Sebastian County deputy who then demanded that he stop taking pictures and provide identification.Purcell said he refused and started recording the incident on his cellphone."At that point he swung at me to try and get the phone,” Purcell said. “I started backing up, and the next thing I know he's physically taking me to the ground with other officers. Their main concern after they took me to the ground was getting the phone.”Purcell was arrested on charges of obstructing governmental operations and resisting arrest. Both charges were eventually dropped.However, the cellphone that contained the video evidence was never returned."Gone, missing, but I believe he deliberately lost it. He got rid of it just so that video wouldn't surface," Purcell, said.Sebastian County Sheriff Bill Hollenbeck said the deputy initially thought Purcell might have been at the home where police were executing a search warrant.Hollenbeck said his department conducted an internal investigation on the arrest and the missing cellphone."Of course whenever evidence is taken into custody it has to be properly documented. In this case it wasn't," Hollenbeck said.Hollenbeck said his deputy received a written reprimand and was ordered to undergo more training.Purcell sued the Sheriff's Department months later in federal court, alleging numerous civil rights violations. On July 16, Purcell won a judgment for $40,000. The case was closed on Sept. 8.Prior to the lawsuit, the Sebastian County Sheriff's Department did not have any specific policies that addressed the filming of law enforcement officers. Since the judgment however, Hollenbeck said a policy is in place."Cameras are everywhere,” he said. “Deputies or law enforcement officers have to understand that the individual rights to members of our society are paramount. The First Amendment right is extremely important, and that right should not be infringed upon. It's just reinforcing the information that the deputies already know, but molding it into a more modern look such as cellphones and other video-type technologies."Purcell said he was offered a settlement by attorneys representing the Sheriff's Department, but he declined and opted for a judgment. Most settlements are sealed and both parties would have been prohibited from talking about monetary amounts."I wanted people to be able to see that they do have a First Amendment right, that a badge doesn't grant extra rights," Purcell said.Hollenbeck said numerous agencies across the state have contacted his office seeking help to draft their own policies to address filming law enforcement officers by citizens in public places.

Of the 1.8 Million Acres of Protected Greenbelt Land in Ontario, only 577 Acres are in Brampton.
That's only 0.03206% of the total Greenbelt area in the Province
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Relatively small & scarce, Brampton's Greenbelt area performs a critical ecological function. This area follows the Credit River watershed and its tributaries and wetlands, but is under stress from growing urban development. The Credit River is cold water fish habitat, a wildlife movement corridor, within a Provincially significant wetland. The Greenbelt around Norval is in close proximity to the growing urban areas of North West Brampton & Georgetown, and performs a significant ecological function. Locating a quarry in this area is not a good choice of sites.
The proposed aggregate extraction area is in close proximity to the historic Village of Norval, a recognised tourism area, and an existing community.
Democrats meeting in Orlando were working late into the night Friday, as supporters of Bernie Sanders made their final push to include his positions in the party's platform before its national convention in Philadelphia later this month.
Sanders backers want the party's position statement to call for the rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a ban on natural gas and oil “fracking” and the creation of a carbon tax, among other changes.
Late Friday, the Democratic National Platform Committee embraced another Sanders priority, voting to approve language calling for a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage.
Earlier in the day, Democrats kicked off a two-day meeting at the DoubleTree at Universal Orlando, the last of four regional sessions to mull the wording of their platform, which carries added meaning this year as tensions remain between backers of Sanders and presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton.
Those tensions were clear Friday.
Sanders supporters staged protests hours before the meeting, wearing stickers and hoisting signs urging the party to formally oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement touted by President Barack Obama.
Meanwhile, supporters of the former secretary of state stood outside the hotel chanting Clinton's name and various slogans, including: “I believe that she will win.”
Perhaps sensing the fight ahead, the platform committee's co-chair, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, began the meeting by saying “there will be disagreements, but we don't have to be disagreeable in that process.”
Rep. Elijah Cummings, who chaired the board that authored a draft of the platform document, joked that the committee should not feel the need to “mess with it too much.”
Friday's session began an hour late, and adjourned just over an hour later for dinner and so members could attend a memorial for the June 12 massacre at Pulse nightclub.
Officials indicated they hoped to come closer to consensus on some sticking points before resuming the committee's meeting about 9 p.m. However, the session remained in recess until nearly 11 p.m.
Nearly all of the platform committee's 187 members attended, including activist Cornell West, former NAACP President Benjamin Jealous and attorney Benjamin Crump, who represented Trayvon Martin's family after the teen's 2012 killing in Sanford.
A draft of the platform released last week is considered more progressive than the party has put forward in recent years. It embraced many of Sanders' goals, including breaking up financial institutions and eliminating super PACs.
But in a recent op-ed for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Sanders wrote that the platform still “needs to be significantly improved” during Democrats' time in Orlando.
The meeting will continue Saturday.

Before Chimera 2.2 I was using only the discrete GTX650, and all my three displays had audio (1 via HDMI and 2 via DVI). This was achieved via pjalm's DSDT patches for my mobo.With the release of Chimera 2.2 I started my journey towards enabling both HD4000 and GTX650 with HDMI audio (on both adapters). I'm using a Z77X-UD5H (HD4000) plus discrete Nvidia GTX 650). The whole thing works great via "IGPEnabler=Yes" and "GraphicsEnabler=No".The only problem is HDMI audio via HD4000. I'm getting audio on the discrete GTX650 (two displays via DVI), but via HD4000 (HDMI) there is no audio signal. I've tried several ways of compiling my DSDT with pjalm's patches (AIO+HD4000+discrete, AIO+discrete+HD4000…), but none has enabled audio over HD4000.Now I'm wondering if changing the port configuration could help with HDMI audio on the HD4000.Is it a trial and error process? Should I always need a DSDT to enable HDMI audio over the HD4000? Or just the right port configuration is enough for enabling HDMI audio?My guess is that I should use the IDs starting with 0166 (the ones for HD4000). Am I right on that?Thanks for this and the rest of wonderful tools !
Three of the eudev development team at the FOSDEM presentation At a presentation at FOSDEM 2013, three of the developers behind udev fork eudev, stated that their primary aim in launching the project back in November was to learn something. Dislike for the udev/systemd developers was, as they repeatedly stressed, not the reason for launching the project – it was not a "hate based fork". The developers also noted that their "pet project" was anything but mature and that users foolish enough to use it in its present state could really mess up their systems.
The above represents just a couple of titbits from a generally unstructured and hard-to-follow presentation in which the three developers failed to convincingly describe either their motivation or plans for the udev fork. For example, as a further reason for forking udev they stated that eudev was intended to support systems on which the /usr/ directory was located on a separate partition and was not mounted by initramfs. Udev has supported this setup from its early days. Because there are some known problems with such a setup, systemd has been warning users when booting this configuration since before udev was merged into systemd. When this was pointed out, the eudev developers were forced to admit that the changes required to fix those problems were indeed required in areas other than in udev.
The eudev developers refer to their inexperience in their presentation A few critical questions were raised and accusations made by Greg Kroah-Hartman, Kay Sievers and Lennart Poettering, who had been invited to the presentation by the eudev team, given chocolates and thanked for programming the code on which eudev is based. In addition to these questions, the three eudev developers were also unable to provide convincing answers to many further questions posed by other audience members. A video of the presentation was streamed online. It is not currently available – in previous years the organisers of FOSDEM have posted the videos of streamed presentations on the web in the weeks following the conference.

"They would have to think about their relationship with Australia," warned Australian Immigration Minister Peter Dutton.
Australian Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has opened the door to a potential refugee resettlement deal between New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, acknowledging it is a decision for the two sovereign states that Australia could not block.
But he warned any arrangement would be against Australia's wishes and would run the risk of souring both countries' diplomatic relationships with Australia – making it unlikely without Canberra's blessing.
"That's an issue between those two countries. Any sovereign state can enter into bilateral arrangements," Dutton said in a Sky News Australia interview on Thursday.
DANIEL MUNOZ/FAIRFAX AUSTRALIA Jacinda Ardern with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull earlier this month, when she reiterated her offer to take 150 refugees from Manus Island.
"They would have to think about other equities within the respective relationships – they would have to think about their relationship with Australia."

* Jacinda Ardern steps up pressure on Malcolm Turnbull over refugee offer
* Brownlee warns Ardern to 'have respect' for Australia's predicament
New Zealand has offered to resettle 150 refugees from Manus Island, where about 370 men are still refusing to leave Australia's decommissioned regional processing centre.
The men have remained on the site without food, water or power supplies since October 31, instead collecting rainwater in buckets and bins.
They say they will not move "from one prison to another" and fear for their safety at alternative accommodation in the Manusian town of Lorengau.
The unfolding humanitarian crisis has attracted widespread condemnation from the United Nations, major international charities and human rights observers.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern repeatedly reiterated New Zealand's resettlement offer to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, including at a recent summit of Asia-Pacific nations, but it has been politely declined.
To date, neither New Zealand nor PNG have been willing to circumvent Canberra, despite mounting concern in both countries about the refugees on Manus Island.
But Ardern has been urged by the Greens and the New Zealand Refugee Council to start talking directly with Port Moresby.
Australian Labor has urged the Turnbull government to accept the Kiwi offer, with immigration spokesman Shayne Neumann citing the one-off resettlement deal with the US as a precedent.
Dutton's remarks on Thursday indicate Australia has no lawful way of stopping New Zealand and PNG striking a bilateral deal. But he would frown on such an arrangement because it could lead boats to restart.
"The people smugglers are watching eagerly at the moment," he said. If there was a pathway to go from PNG to NZ to Australia, "the train reopens, and I'm not going to allow that to happen".
Dutton said he was not threatening the Kiwis or PNG, but "any sovereign nation, in any arrangement, would have to think about other equities in the relationship".
He pointed out that Operation Sovereign Borders, paid for and executed by Australia, also benefited New Zealand by intercepting and turning around boats bound for that country.
It is understood four boats marketed to asylum seekers as being bound for New Zealand - carrying 164 people - have been picked up and turned around under Operation Sovereign Borders.
"If any boats arrive tomorrow, those people aren't going to Auckland, they're going to the processing centre on Nauru," Dutton said on Sky News.
He also dismissed Ardern's undertaking to give $3 million for services for refugees on Manus Island and Nauru as "a waste of money".
Dutton again called on the 370 remaining men to end the stand-off and move into the alternative accommodation on offer.
"This is like the tenants who refuse to leave the house," he said. "They need to move out of the regional processing centre because it's not safe. They have trashed the place."
PNG police again declined to use force to remove the men as the stand-off entered its 17th day, despite earlier threats they would be forcibly moved to Lorengau.
One of the leaders of the resisting refugees, Iranian journalist Behrouz Boochani, said conditions at the site were deteriorating, including dirty toilets, polluted water and untreated infections.
"The bodies (are) getting weak and it's a real danger," he said. "We are living in a condition that is threatening our health."
The Kansas City Chiefs are in the midst of their mandatory three-day mini-camp this week but that doesn't mean they should stop trying to improve their roster.
Now that most of the major players are set, it is time for Scott Pioli to go bargain hunting for veteran backups. The Chiefs were woefully shallow on depth a season ago and when they were hit with the injury bug their season went down the drain faster than you can say Sabby Piscitelli.
After another period of free agency and drafting, KC is a much deeper team heading into 2012. Still, if Pioli thinks his team is set, he's fooling himself. Injuries can and likely will strike again. There are still a number of veteran players available that Pioli should be able to scoop up for depth.
Here are five veteran players I think the Chiefs should kick the tires on.
1. Leigh Bodden, CB, 30
Bodden is a former Brown, Lion and Patriot. He landed in New England in 2009 on a a one-year deal and started 14 of 15 games for the Pats. After a brief contract dispute over an extension, New England inked Bodden to a four-year, $22 million deal with $10 million guaranteed. Unfortunately for Bodden, he injured his shoulder in August and the Pats cut him October.
The Chiefs should definitely take a look at Bodden so long is his shoulder is healed. He's only 30 and has 345 tackles, 18 interceptions and 8 forced fumbles in his career. He also has 0 pass deflections. He'll be 31 in September.
KC can likely get Bodden on a value one-year deal as he looks to resurrect his career. He's being playing for one more big contract so the Chiefs would be getting maximum effort. Besides, you can never have enough CBs.
2. Jeff Faine, C 31
Faine hasn't been very good since he was a Pro Bowl alternate in 2007. He was drafted by the Browns with the 21st overall pick in 2003. He has since played for the Saints and last year he was with the Bucs. His best days are behind him but the Chiefs are pretty shallow at center and could use a veteran backup for Rodney Hudson. Faine isn't a starter anymore but he is a vet that can help Hudson along and step in if need be.
There just aren't any centers out there of any real quality. Faine is probably KC's best bet if they want to add one more lineman. Remember Rudy Niswanger. It is best to have some help.
3. Braylon Edwards, WR 29
The Chiefs have a solid WR group for the first time in a while but I'd like to see them look at bringing a veteran like Edwards to camp. Edwards was cut in December by the 49ers after he was injured most of the season. Still, at only 29, Edwards is a big-bodied receiver who could help out in KC as a #4 option. Braylon was productive in New York on 2010 with 904 receiving yards.
If Edwards had a good camp I could see him replacing Terrance Copper or Junior Hemingway. I say he's worth a look.
4. Gary Brackett, ILB 32
Brackett was still pretty much on top of his game before he went down with a shoulder injury last year that landed him on IR. The Colts released him after the season.
He's on the wrong side of 30 and has spent his career playing in the Colts' 4-3 so it might be a bit late to teach this old dog new tricks but he was too good of a player before his injury for the Chiefs to not check out. They are pretty well set at MLB but what the heck?
5. Travis LaBoy, OLB 30
LaBoy might be the smartest pickup on this list. He is often injured but when he can stay on the field he has been productive, especially when needed to pressure the QB. He played about 650 snaps for the Chargers last season and snagged a sack, 13 pressures and 15 stops. He will be 31 in August but the Chiefs could use some Hali/Houston insurance of the veteran variety. Like all the players on this list, he'd come cheap and could be had for a one-year deal. Why not bring him to camp and see what he has left? PFF graded him -0.8 on the season last year which is just ever so slightly below average. He could present good value.
All right Addicts. Those are my five remaining free agents KC should look at. Who are yours?
The 1997 Ardabil earthquake occurred on 28 February with a moment magnitude of 6.1 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). The strike-slip earthquake occurred in northern Iran near the city of Ardabil.
Background and tectonics [ edit ]
Ardabil and the surrounding province which bears its name are agricultural lands, primarily populated by Azeris. Two other earthquakes damaged northern Iran the month before, killing at least 79 people.[1]
Damage and casualties [ edit ]
The earthquake occurred at 12:57 UTC (4:27 p.m. Iran Standard Time) and lasted for 15 seconds.[1] At least 1,100 people were killed, 2,600 injured, 36,000 homeless, 12,000 houses damaged or destroyed and 160,000 livestock killed in the Ardabil area of northwestern Iran. Severe damage was observed to roads, electrical power lines, communications and water distribution systems around Ardabil.[2] Hospitals and other medical buildings were overflowing with patients as a result of the earthquake. More than 83 villages experienced some form of damage.[1]
Within the village of Villadareh, 85 corpses were recovered from the rubble. In Varania, another small village near the epicenter that had previously had a population of 85, all but 20 residents had perished.[1]
Aftershocks [ edit ]
Roughly 350 aftershocks followed the main Ardabil earthquake. The largest one had a magnitude of 5.2 on the Richter scale.[5] Aid workers and rescuers approximate death toll as high as 3,000.[6]
Aftermath and relief efforts [ edit ]
In the aftermath of the tremor, 18 inches (46 cm) of snow fell, hampering rescue efforts. The Iranian government declared three days of mourning to honor victims.[1] Iranian president visited the damaged area on 4 March.[5] Rescue workers at the scene disputed the official government death toll, claiming it was as much as three times higher.[6]
Nonetheless, head of the Iranian Branch of Red Crescent Seifollah Vahid Dastjerdi was satisfied with the pace of relief work. More than 8,700 tents, 21,800 blankets, 15,300 heaters and lanterns, 2,000 bottles of baby formula and 80 tons of bread were given to the victims. Additionally, 60 ambulances, 127 trucks and vans and two helicopters transported victims, relief workers, and supplies to and from the affected region.[6]
Air crash [ edit ]
On 3 March, a small aircraft on a relief mission crashed about 16 miles (25 km) northeast of Ardabil. Its wreckage was discovered the following day. There were four people on board the Falcon aircraft but no survivors. The crash was blamed on poor weather and heavy snowfall.[5]

Image copyright SPL Image caption The energy market is responding to shifting cost and political pressures
It's get-tough time. John Swinney, Scotland's economy secretary, is out to kick some bahookey when he next meets Scottish Power executives.
Following their sharp increases in energy prices, he says they need to explain themselves.
Chris Huhne, the UK's energy secretary, is telling that company's customers to shop around for better value. He doesn't seem to have noticed that industry experts, and inexperts besides, all expect other energy suppliers to follow Scottish Power's unpopular lead.
But could it be this has a lot to do with choices the politicians have been making, or failing to make?
Energy bills include several elements. Just under two-thirds of bills are explained by wholesale prices. One pound in six goes on the cost of distribution, for both gas and electricity.
Transmission charges through the major grid networks account for 2% of gas costs and 4% for electricity.
Then there's VAT, which has stuck at 5% while the main rate has gone up.
Renewable upgrades
But what about the 'environmental' cost? For the average gas bill, that costs 4% of bills sliced off to promote renewable energy, cut emissions and generally tackle climate change. For electricity, it's 10% of your bill.
And of course, the decision to charge that is not down to the power companies, but to government and regulator - fulfilling international commitments on carbon emissions, and in some cases going further and faster.
How much more will these choices cost consumers in future?
The SNP government, for instance, is committed to sourcing 100% of Scotland's electricity needs from renewable sources by the end of the decade. However laudable in environmental and industrial strategy terms, that's going to cost money. And it's not government that's paying the price, but consumers.
It's reckoned about £200bn is needed to upgrade Britain's energy infrastructure, to meet the aspirations of renewables and to catch up with low investment in the industry over recent decades.
That catch-up is required because politicians of other political colours were slow to respond to the looming energy crunch point, preferring to pretend that energy bills could be kept low.
The investment programme includes wind farms, and the pylons and cables to get power into the grid. Then there's the re-orientation of the grid itself to bring energy from renewable sources to population centres.
It also includes new pipelines and terminals to bring gas from outside the UK, and it goes some way to the high costs of creating a North Sea supergrid for electricity. And a large chunk of the bill is from replacing ageing power stations, with cleaner burn and emissions technologies.
Pricing clarity
So while Scottish Power this week announced it will load 19% onto gas bills and an average 10% on to electricity, how much more will these choices cost consumers in future?
An analysis by Ofgem, the industry regulator, concluded the best case scenario for energy prices is a rise of only 14%. This was written in 2009, when it was not clear that world energy prices would recover from recession. Since then, they have.
Image copyright PA Image caption Ofgem has looked at the cost of moving towards new sources of energy
Its scenarios ranged more realistically above 20% to a high of a 60% increase by 2016, and then falling back. That would see a sharp spike in global gas prices.
That level of pessimism might be overdoing it. Although there are several reasons for upward pressure, the gas price has not seen oil's rapid increase, largely through new sources of gas being cracked open with the fracking boom, and there is improving capacity for importing liquid natural gas by tanker.
Last December, Ofgem took another look at the cost of changing generation and distribution networks to reflect new renewable sources of energy, and the impact that could have on bills.
That report suggests more modest increases for consumer bills this decade. But within the next 40 years, it assumes electricity bills will have more than doubled to pay for the new investment, from just over £400 last year to between £800 and £900, in real terms.
Clearly, there is pressure to be put on the energy utilities; to ensure they don't abuse their market power, to add clarity to pricing, and to ensure they respond as fast to downwards wholesale prices as they do to the upward pressures.
But there's also some clarity required about the political decisions that contribute to those increasing bills, and about the era of cheap energy that's now behind us.
The city of Atlanta in partnership with the PATH Foundation, Turner, The Coca-Cola Co. and Georgia Institute of Technology opened PATH Parkway at Georgia Tech. PATH Parkway represents 1.5-miles of walking and biking infrastructure separate from vehicles that connects West Midtown to Georgia Tech, The Coca-Cola Company Atlanta Office Complex and Downtown.
The new facility features safe, separated bicycle infrastructure linking the John Portman protected bike lanes, the Stone Mountain Trail, the Atlanta BeltLine Eastside trail and other essential bicycle infrastructure within the City.
In 2012, Mayor Reed committed to the goal of making bicycling an integral part of daily life for Atlanta residents, workers and visitors by the year 2016. This goal included creating 120 miles of bicycle lanes and trails. Today, the City of Atlanta has 114 miles of completed bicycle infrastructure with an additional eight miles under construction. In 2016, the City of Atlanta was ranked 43 in Bicycle Magazine's Top 50 Best Bicycle Cities.
“Our goal is to connect the people of Atlanta to the city in the most safe, convenient and fun ways,” said Tim Keane, Commissioner of the Department of City Planning. “PATH Parkway represents how the connections we make through infrastructure enhance how people experience their community, providing them the opportunity to explore the many ways the city continues to grow.”
Since September, more than 3000 people have ridden a Relay Bike Share bike on PATH Parkway. The City installed four bike share stations along the 1.5-mile path to complement the infrastructure and provide people better access to bikes.
In 2015, the City of Atlanta adopted Cycle Atlanta Study: Phase 1.0. This signature planning study identified 32 miles of new bicycle infrastructure within the Atlanta BeltLine limits.
A presidential race, a U.S. Senate race and an avalanche of ballot measures that would do everything from legalize marijuana to end California's death penalty are drawing most of the attention as Election Day nears.
But across California, a record $4.1 billion in ballot measures to preserve parks and open space are also vying for voters' attention in what could become a wave of green riding the tide of a rebounding economy and record voter turnout.
Environmental groups and developers are closely watching the measures, which could shape the landscape in the Bay Area and Southern California for decades to come by raising new money for trails, parks and open space preserves. Others would impose strict development limits outside existing city boundaries.
“It's not the sort of thing that's as dramatic as a presidential election, but it matters,” said Tim Ahern, a spokesman for the Trust for Public Land, an environmental group in San Francisco. “The economy is better. People are feeling like they want to invest.
“And they want a nice park to take their kids to — or to go jogging in or walk their dog. These measures pass in red states and blue states.”
Among the issues that will appear on the ballot Nov. 8 are tax hikes in Los Angeles and San Diego counties that would fund parks and trails, while voters in communities from Monterey to Sonoma counties are weighing in on similar measures.
In Hayward, Castro Valley, San Lorenzo and nearby communities, a $250 million bond would fund parks, playgrounds and trails. And Measure H in Gilroy would put an urban growth boundary around the city, limiting new development on farmland.
Most of the tax measures require a two-thirds majority vote to pass. In many cases, developers and other groups with concerns about the proposals have not mounted formal campaigns, but are urging voters to vote no.
“We all love open space, but where are our kids and grandkids going to live and work? Where are they going to have to move to own a house?” said Lisa Vorderbrueggen, a spokeswoman for the Building Industry Association of the Bay Area, based in Walnut Creek.
Brian Schmidt, program director with the Greenbelt Alliance in San Francisco, countered that there's plenty of land to build new housing on — and it should be done within existing city limits, particularly near rail and other transit systems to reduce traffic.
“The type of sprawl developments you see in these areas outside city limits are some of the least dense and least affordable housing,” he said. “It does not do much to solve the housing problem in the Bay Area.”
“People want to preserve the scenic beauty,” he added. “They don't want cities to endlessly sprawl into one another.”
Vorderbrueggen said developers want to build more condominiums, apartments and single family housing in existing cities. But, she said, it can take up to 10 years in some areas to secure all the permits and approvals, often because of opposition from homeowners who don't want new construction near them.
“It is the hardest type of housing to build,” she said. “There are legitimate concerns with new developments about quality of life in the neighborhood. But time after time when developers try to build dense infill housing, they meet significant opposition.”
Schmidt says his group supports a number of housing measures on Bay Area ballots, including Measure A in Santa Clara County, a $950 million bond to help first-time home buyers, veterans and the homeless find new housing.
In recent years, major open space measures have generally passed. A $23 per parcel tax in 2014 for open space, parks and beaches in Los Angeles County narrowly fell short of the two-thirds majority needed. But in June, 70 percent of voters in the nine Bay Area counties approved a $12 parcel tax for restoration of San Francisco Bay and its wetlands, guaranteeing $500 million over the next 20 years.
A huge turnout in deep blue California, where Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by 26 points in the latest poll, combined with the revitalization of the economy means the measures have a tailwind, said Daniel Press, a professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz.
“If you take the advocates of these measures out for a drink, many of them will say they wait for an economy that is doing relatively well and a general election,” Press said. “They want to ride on the coattails of other issues. Right now is probably the best time you can put measures like this on the ballot.”
OPEN SPACE AND PARKS BALLOT MEASURES
On Nov. 8, voters in communities across California will consider $4.1 billion in measures to preserve parks and open space. Among them:
Editors' note June 8, 2017: At its Worldwide Developer's Conference, Apple unveiled a new iPad Pro that replaces the 9.7-inch iPad Pro introduced in 2016. Starting at $649, £619 and A$949, the new model packs a a bigger screen -- a 10.5-inch Retina display -- into a footprint similar to that of the cheaper, non-Pro 9.7-inch model Apple debuted in March. The new 10.5-inch iPad Pro also comes equipped with a more powerful processor, higher-quality cameras, and, when it debuts in the fall, iOS 11 -- upgrades that are also coming to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro (reviewed below), which starts at $799, £679 or AU$1,249. The other two iPad models -- the iPad and iPad Mini 4 -- remain a part of the lineup, unchanged since their respective introduction and refresh earlier this year.
The original (12.9-inch) iPad Pro review, published in November 2015 and updated regularly since, follows.
The iPad has dreamed of owning the future of computing since the day it was born. Five and a half years later, the iPad Pro -- the biggest, fastest, most powerful Apple tablet to date -- stakes a powerful claim on that lofty goal.
Looking back, it's been a steady march. When I bought my first iPad half a decade ago, it became my all-in-one e-reader, game machine, even modular laptop. It did a lot of things I needed. I carried it to work each day, in a small bag over my shoulder. It kept me company when my dad was sick in a hospital uptown. It kept me connected on trips to my mom's house on Long Island. It stayed with me, while my laptop sat at home.
I wanted it to replace my Mac. But it couldn't do everything. I needed, and still do need, my everyday laptop. For work, in particular. Certain apps and Web tools just didn't work well with it and I couldn't edit easily. I kept revisiting the iPad, with similar results.
Since then, PCs have arrived to bridge the gap between tablet and laptop. But compared to something like the Microsoft Surface Pro, Apple has continued to keep iPads and Macs separate, even as they have drifted closer in spirit. There's no need to wait on the future: the future is now.

Apple's iPad Pro is the biggest -- literally -- and boldest attempt to reinvent what the iPad fundamentally is and can be. It has a nearly 13-inch screen. Some new inputs and accessories, like a super-accurate stylus called the Pencil, and a new side connector for keyboards. An operating system that allows for split-screen multitasking.
I'm writing this review on the iPad Pro. I've been living my life off its large screen, and I'm not the only one. We had three other people at CNET using the iPad Pro, working on this review and much of their other normal workday responsibilities: Marc Mendell, creative director for CBS Interactive, who guides the look and feel of CNET.com, CNET Magazine and all of our sister sites; Ariel Nuñez, one of our many talented videographers and video editors, who edited the video below completely on an iPad Pro; and Lindsey Turrentine, CNET's editor-in-chief, who used it for more than a week as a stand-in for her everyday computer.

You'd think a super-large iPad might feel absurd. But over time, it grew on all of us.
It's beautifully made, and its extra space can be surprisingly useful at times. But it still wasn't a complete stand-in for an everyday computer for any of us...although it's priced like one: $799, £679 or AU$1,249 for the starter 32GB model; $949, £799 or AU$1,499 for the 128GB model; and $1,079, £899 or AU$1,699 for the version with 128GB and 4G LTE data. And that doesn't even include a keyboard or any other accessories.
It's an amazing tablet for artists, however, and this is what the iPad Pro might really be best at: a larger canvas for graphics work, with an input tool in the Pencil that's as good as it gets.
For everyone else, it has its limitations -- like any other iPad. But
it could become a Mac replacement, if and when Apple lets it
, through apps and iOS. The hardware's fantastic, fast, and the screen's as impressive as advertised. But the apps and the inputs it supports need to rise up to make it everything it can be. I hope it happens, because the one thing standing in the way of this "Pro" iPad is greater flexibility and more customized software. The iPad is growing up, and it can use some new tools. And a lot more apps.
Drawing like an artist
I'll tell you right now who's going to want an iPad Pro: anyone who draws or works with images. Its killer app doesn't even come in the box. The Pencil, Apple's new stylus is sold separately, for $99, £79 or AU$165.
It's specifically designed to work with the iPad Pro, and it blows away any other stylus I've ever used
, even Microsoft's Surface Pen. It's fast, accurate, pressure-sensitive, comfortable, and for apps that support it, glorious.
Marc Mendell, an artist by trade, loved it right away. "This device was made for me," he said. "So sweet, it made my teeth hurt." While noting that it was "ultra precise and reactive to drawing actions," he missed some of the wider, brush-like qualities of the capacitive 53 Pencil, a stylus that's been available for several years and made to work with 53's own Paper app. Still, he found Apple's Pencil better to use as a tool: "I'd gladly use it in an additive sense."
View full gallery Josh Miller/CNET
Even non-artists like me can appreciate it: it feels like a regular pen. I was able to write by hand and have it feel normal. The Pencil is far more accurate than the mushier capacitive styluses you're probably used to trying on an iPad. It's more like Samsung's S-Pen for its phones and tablets, or Microsoft's pen for Surface.
The magic part comes when you tilt the Pencil's tip to an angle: it can do shading like a real pencil. Any amount of off-angle tilt can do extra things depending on what an app allows. Pressure sensitivity, while it takes getting used to, is finely tuned. The combination make this feel like a physical art tool, rather than a piece of technology. "It took time, but I got used to what I referred to as the shock absorber -- how the nib reacts to contact with tablet," said Mendell. "It's responsive and recognizes the pressure well."
View full gallery Josh Miller/CNET
I loved doodling around with Pencil on as many apps as I could find to support it: Apple's Notes app, Procreate, Paper by 53, Adobe's new suite of iPad Pro-optimized tools and Evernote. My 7-year-old son picked it up and loved drawing with it too. He just treated it like one of his colored pencils in his art box. To him it was just a sketchpad. Lindsey Turrentine noted that her 9-year-old daughter immediately took to it and started making art in the Notes app. "She said, 'It's pretty good. I like it so much better than how you have to use your fingers in drawings. This pen really works; it's very accurate.'"
View full gallery Josh Miller/CNET
The Pencil pairs via Bluetooth, and also needs charging: a Lightning plug on the end lets you plug it into the Pro for a quick charge (20 minutes took it from 38 to 100 percent), or plug into a Lightning cable using an included adapter to charge separately. It gets 12 hours on a charge, but I've never drawn long enough at a clip to exhaust it.
I love the Pencil, but I wish it came included with the already very expensive iPad Pro. It's also weird that there's nowhere to clip it or magnetically attach it to the iPad, either. And I don't like how it has a removable end cap to hide its Lightning charger, or that it juts weirdly out the side of the iPad when charging, like an awkward thumb.
View full gallery Sarah Tew/CNET
But those are quibbles. The Pencil is so good, all iPads should support it, but right now, it only works with the Pro (I'm sure future iPads will). And it really should come packaged with the Pro, because even if you're not an artist, you're missing out on what the iPad Pro can do if you're not using it.

Smart keyboards, smart connectors
Apple's added bags of potential to the iPad Pro with a new side connector port, called Smart Connector. It's a small row of magnetic contacts used to attach accessories, similar to how Microsoft's Surface tablets connect to their keyboard covers. Accessories snap on, and can be powered by the iPad.
I wrote this whole review on the iPad Pro's first two Smart Connector accessories: the Smart Keyboard, made by Apple, and the Logi Create Backlit Keyboard Case with Smart Connector. I alternated between them over a week and a half. I don't have a clear favorite.
View full gallery Josh Miller/CNET
Apple's is thin and light, but offers no back protection and unfolds into origami-like keyboard and iPad stand modes. The keys, covered in a smooth nylon, are sealed off from dust and are extremely responsive, but feel a little widely spaced for me.
Logitech's keyboard is bulkier: with the iPad snapped in, it's nearly the size of a 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro. It gives the full protection of a proper case, and the backlit keys are fantastic, more like a standard laptop. But these keyboards are both sold separately, and cost over $150 each (Apple's is $169, £139 or AU$269). Yes, you can buy a $40 Bluetooth keyboard that handles the basics, but it wouldn't double as a case or screen protector. And neither keyboard comes with what I really want most: a trackpad.
View full gallery Sarah Tew/CNET
The Smart Connector could power other peripherals and inputs, in theory: like, for instance, a trackpad. The iPad Pro lacks one, and its iOS 9 software doesn't support the idea of one except for some limited cursor control on the iPad's soft on-screen keyboard, if you press both fingers down. To edit and work on the Web with my work tools (Google Drive, or my company's Web-based content management system), I need a trackpad. I hope iOS 10 and future peripherals allow it.

For writing, however, I could work at a fast clip on the iPad Pro. The Logi keyboard was better for my lap, while Apple's is best on a flat desk. Neither, however, allows adjustable angles for the screen like a laptop does. And the extra-high iPad screen made it a tough fit in cramped places like my New Jersey Transit train seat. Apple's 12-inch MacBook, or the 11-inch Air, are far more compact.

Plus size
There are times when I forget I'm working on an iPad at all: sitting at my desk, losing myself in that gigantic screen.
Yeah, the iPad Pro is big. It's like the top half of a MacBook, literally. In terms of length and width, it's between a 13-inch MacBook Air and 12-inch MacBook. You can hold it in one hand, but its giant size makes it seriously unwieldy. It's lighter than it looks, though, trust me: At 1.57 pounds (713 grams), it's not much heavier than the very first iPad. That's an impressive accomplishment, given how much bigger it is.
View full gallery Sarah Tew/CNET
Because of its dimensions, you'll need a work area with enough space for its footprint and a laptop-size bag to carry it around in. It stands up fine on a desk with keyboard and stand accessories, like a mini monitor, but its best use might be flat on a table, or your lap.

Friendly reminder:
You cannot pledge allegiance to a nation state and its flag and the name of God, for God has no political boundary. God is love, period. God is universal, nameless, faceless, and with no allegiance to anything other than love.
A “Christian Nation” is absolutely heretical. Christ did not come into this world to become a modifier. Look what happened to the Holy Roman Empire.
Jesus said you must hate your mother and father and love your enemies. This is not obtuse provocation, but it's spiritual deployment of true identity, which no longer resides in skin color combination, ideology, genealogy, name, people, places and things, but in the brotherhood and sisterhood of all humankind, which is ruled by love at any cost.
Love your neighbor as yourself. Christ's words, and the example of his life and death — albeit strange and socially unsuccessful (he lived and died unpopular and in poverty) — were equally sublime and sacrificial. To gain access to true love and true self, you must die to yourself, to your family, to your heritage, your narrow-minded ideology, your ego, your ill-conditioned consciousness and your false identity.
[Christians, don't be fooled: Trump has deep religious convictions]
You must eradicate all the corrupt, theological fearmongering they preach from the pulpit and from behind the political podium. Get real and get right with God. Go in your closet and pray for your enemies. You must take up the cross and follow that narrow path of sacrifice and love and service.
You must love your neighbor, love your enemies, serve the poor, give everything away and put yourself last. This goes against everything the world has taught you, and it goes against your instinct and it most certainly goes against the laws of free enterprise and corporate interests.
Money and power and governments are fraudulent and false gods. We must be in the world not of the world.
When Jesus Christ says, “Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's,” he acknowledges it as a necessary evil (and throws some shade), but he also compels us to participate honestly and responsibly and with righteousness and stewardship in a faulty and dysfunctional society even as we are called to be ideologically and socially disposed.
We must acknowledge that the real substance of life has nothing to do with money or power or prestige or greatness. Your money and your power must be given away (as tax and tithe and service to others). To gain your life is to lose it. To lose your life is to gain it. The life you live is not your own. Give your life away.

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Regulating internet providers more like public utility companies could hurt the Internet and the U.S. economy, more than two dozen network technology and equipment makers have told U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker.

Thirty-three companies including Cisco Systems Inc, Intel Corp and International Business Machines Corp joined the chorus of citizens, activists, lawmakers and companies debating how the U.S. government should regulate Internet service providers (ISPs).
Other companies signing a letter to Pritzker published on Tuesday included Alcatel Lucent SA, Ericsson, Nokia Oyj's network arm NSN, Panasonic Corp of North America and CommScope Holding Co Inc.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is considering so-called “net neutrality” rules that would determine how ISPs such as Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc manage web traffic on their networks.
FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has proposed rules that would allow ISPs to charge content companies to ensure their websites or applications load smoothly and quickly, as long as such deals are deemed “commercially reasonable.”
Critics, including popular video streaming service Netflix Corp and numerous advocacy groups, argue the plan would threaten less deep-pocketed content providers by potentially relegating them to “slow lanes” on the web.
MORE POWER
Instead, they call on the FCC to reclassify broadband as a telecommunication service rather than the less-regulated information service it is now, saying the move would give more power to the FCC to stop potential violators of net neutrality.
ISPs and Republicans, both in Congress and at the FCC, have rejected the idea.
On Tuesday, 33 telecom network and tech makers, who are members of the Telecommunications Industry Association and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association and who depend on ISPs for business, spoke out against the reclassification idea as well.
“A sudden shift from the existing light-touch approach – which has been an unqualified success and the basis for billions of dollars in investments – to the prescriptive regime of Title II would be extremely disruptive to the broadband marketplace,” they wrote, referring to the legal authority the FCC would use to reclassify ISPs.
Experts have disagreed on whether or how reclassification would adequately prevent pay-for-priority deals.
Wheeler has not proposed reclassification as the solution, but has not taken it off the table as a potential option.
FCC is collecting public comment on the tentatively proposed rules until Sept. 15 and will hold several public workshops on various aspects of the regulations in the following weeks.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy will hold a hearing on the issue of net neutrality on Sept. 17.
A California girl was sucked under a freight train and killed while retrieving her cell phone from the tracks this weekend.
Jenna Betti, 14, was hanging out on the tracks with her boyfriend near Martinez on Sunday evening. The train crew of the eastbound Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway freighter said they saw the teens jump out of the way as the train came around a bend, according to a company spokeswoman. But a split-second decision would prove fatal for Betti.
"Both individuals got off of the track, and for some unknown reason, one of the individuals came back on the track," railway spokeswoman Lena Kent told the San Francisco Chronicle.
According to her mother, Jenna went back for her phone.
"She dropped her phone and went back to retrieve it," Dena Betti wrote in a Facebook post. "She didn't judge the approach, and the train creates a vacuum, we were told, and it sucks you in... we are beyond devastated."
Betti, an 8th grader at Martinez Junior High School, was a popular student and star soccer player. On Monday, classmates at the school wore pink -- her favorite color -- in her memory. District officials had grief counselors on hand to help students through the tragedy.
“It's a hard issue to deal with students. We want them to know that it was a tragic accident and that her life will be remembered,” Rami Muth, Martinez Unified School District superintendent, told CBS San Francisco.
Friends and family are left struggling to cope with their loss.
NYPD
Forty-seven dogs were saved after police and ASPCA workers busted a Bronx dog-fighting ring from the basement of a Bronx apartment building yesterday. Building super Raul Sanchez, 57, is accused of being the ringleader of the operation, and has been arrested on animal fighting and cruelty charges. “It's pretty horrific inside — horrible conditions. I couldn't even describe it,” NYPD Deputy Inspector Anthony Favale told reporters. “The dogs appear to be in various stages of abuse and injury.”
The bust happened at 1254 Sherman Avenue, a six-story apartment building in the Bronx. Altogether, 47 pit bulls ranging in age from 12 weeks to five years were rescued. The ASPCA said they were living in a windowless basement, which included a makeshift arena with estimated capacity for 100 spectators. Among the items confiscated included dog treadmills, harnesses, muzzles, syringes, and a shopping cart full of raw chicken parts.
“Organized dog fighting is a brutal form of animal abuse where dogs are exploited and forced to fight as their owners profit from their torture,” said Howard Lawrence, senior director of operations for the ASPCA's Humane Law Enforcement department. “The dogs we saw today exhibited scarring and injuries consistent with fighting dogs. The ASPCA is determined to protect New York City's animals from this form of cruelty.”
They also said that some of the dogs had never even been outside before: "Those white marks on their faces, those are all scars," Lawrence added. "They may not have seen the light of day, perhaps even since they were born."
[aur-dev] Git repositories for AUR packages
Hi list, The next major AUR release will come with Git integration. In this email, I am going to summarize previous ideas and make things a bit more concrete (sketch implementation details etc.) If you are new to this topic, please read [1] and [2] first. Our plan is to create one Git repository per package base. Each of the Git repositories contains a PKGBUILD and zero or more additionally required files, so you will no longer need to build a source tarball. There will be a pkgbuild-introspection utility to generate and write .AURINFO metadata without automatically putting that file inside the tarball. Florian had the idea to use a shared Git object database for space efficiency. When creating a new account, users will be able to upload an SSH public key. This key will be stored in the AUR database and can also be changed using the profile edit page. Using this public key, users will be able to push to repositories they maintain using Git over SSH. For authentication, a custom script doing a lookup in the AUR user database will be used as AuthorizedKeysCommand. If a matching key is found, that script prints the corresponding authorized_keys line with a forced command that invokes a wrapper around the Git shell. That wrapper in turn does authorization by checking maintainership and then calls git-shell(1). Using Git hooks, the .AURINFO metadata of a package is parsed when pushing and the AUR package database is updated accordingly. Hooks will also take care of checking the tree objects for huge files etc. The reception.denyNonFastForwards configuration option will be enabled to prevent users from rewriting the history. In order to submit new packages, you will be able to generate empty Git repositories via the AUR web interface. During the transition period, all existing source tarballs will be converted to bare repositories with one initial commit whose tree equals the tarball contents. Instead of the source tarball download link and the PKGBUILD preview, there will be a public clone URL on the package details page. In a second step, cgit will be configured to provide a web-based interface to all the repositories. Then, links to tarball snapshots and to the PKGBUILD preview will be added to the details page as a replacement for the "Download tarball" and "View PKGBUILD" links (all this is supposed to happen before the first release). As soon as all this is set up, we can add support for multiple maintainers and related features. If there are any questions or suggestions regarding this setup, please feel free to ask/reply. Regards, Lukas [1] https://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/aur-dev/2013-March/002411.html [2] https://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/aur-dev/2014-January/002592.html
From being named America's favorite place to hosting US Secretary of Interior Sally Jewell, from setting record visitation numbers to launching Centennial celebration plans, Acadia National Park made news in 2014.
Here are the top 10 stories in Acadia on My Mind's opinion:
1. Acadia No. 1 – Viewers of “Good Morning America” named Acadia as their favorite place in July, while USA Today readers voted Acadia as the top national park, ahead of Glacier and Yellowstone, earlier that same month.
2. Record-breaking October – With more than 313,000 visitors that month, Acadia recorded its highest ever October visitation. Park officials attributed the bump up to good weather, peak foliage, increasing cruise ship traffic and national media attention.
3. Island Explorer sets records – For the first time, more than 500,000 passengers took the popular fare-free shuttle bus during a season, as we reported first in this blog on Oct. 29. The bus system marked another milestone on June 30, when it carried its 5 millionth passenger, an Otter Creek high school student commuting to her summer job in Bar Harbor.
4. US Secretary of Interior Sally Jewell visits – In her first trip to Acadia since being named interior secretary, Jewell joined National Park Service Director Jon Jarvis in promoting a program between the park service and the nonprofit Schoodic Institute involving youth and science research. Jewell also shared a personal story about her first visit to Acadia as a college student, and her concerns about global warming, and inspiring the next generation of rangers, wildlife biologists and supporters of national parks.
5. New trails and major trail work – On June 7, National Trails Day, the Otter Cove and Quarry Trails were officially opened, creating a network that allows campers at Blackwoods to hike directly to Gorham Mountain and other areas in the park. The planned improvement of a couple of Otter Creek historic village connector trails open up even more hiking opportunities in the area, not only for campers, but also for Otter Creek residents and visitors. A major federal grant allowed the hiring of the most trail workers in 80 years and major rehabilitation of Gorge Path and the Asticou Trail. A smaller nonprofit grant led to better protection of the fragile summit of Sargent Mountain.
6. 20th anniversary of Hawk Watch and Artist-in-Residence Program – For the last 20 years, park officials, volunteers and visitors have been helping to document migrating raptors, part of a national effort to monitor the health of bird populations. Hawk Watch is now a collaborative effort between the park's interpretive division and the nonprofit Schoodic Institute's bird ecology program; it also gets support from the Friends of Acadia. The Artist-in-Residence Program at Acadia National Park, which accepts 12 to 20 artists annually, also marked its 20th anniversary this year. That program, also a collaboration between the Schoodic Institute and the park, provides artists with free lodging on the Schoodic Education and Research Center campus. In return, they are asked to provide a public program for each week of residency, and to donate a representative work to help raise funds for the program.
7. Banner year for peregrine falcons – Chicks fledged at four sites, at Jordan Cliffs, the precipice on the east face of Champlain Mountain, Valley Cove cliffs and on privately owned Ironbound Island, where the park holds a conservation easement. It might be the first time that particular combination of four sites was home during the same year to peregrine fledglings, according to park officials.
8. Pushing to protect puffins – Although too far offshore to be visible from Acadia, puffins have so captured the public imagination,visitors to the park often ask rangers where they can see the seabirds with the colorful beaks. That connection between Acadia, the public and puffins may help account for the Acadia National Park Community's Facebook page sharing encouraging news about a higher percentage of fledglings on Maine puffin islands this summer, and the resulting 800 Facebook likes. And it may also help account for the community's Facebook page sharing our blog post about stalled efforts to expand federal wilderness designation to some of Maine's puffin islands, despite this year being the 50th Anniversary of the Wilderness Act.
9. Planning for Acadia Centennial celebration kicks off – With the unveiling of the Acadia National Park Centennial Logo in May, and the finalizing of ways to become an Acadia Centennial Partner in September, the planning for the Centennial is well under way. More than 40 partners have been lined up so far by the park and Friends of Acadia. The year 2016 marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of Acadia initially as Sieur de Monts National Monument, and also of the National Park Service.
10. New Isle au Haut and historic vista management plans – For the first time in years, the park service has updated the maximum number of visitors to Isle au Haut in its revised management plan for the least visited part of the park, increasing it from 120 to 128 a day. And also for the first time in years, the park is restoring historic road side views as part of a vista management plan.
One last item worth noting in a year-in-review round-up, even if it's not an official news story: Acadia on My Mind started as a blog in 2014.
From the first post on May 24, about the unveiling of the Acadia National Park Centennial Logo, to this, our 47th, we've learned a lot about blogging, social media and Acadia.
We hope you've gotten as much out of reading our blog as we have in researching and writing it over the past year.
Onward to 2015 and beyond!
Rick Pitino spoke to the media for approximately five minutes following Louisville's tough loss to North Carolina. Here is a recap of Pitino's comments.
Opening statement on the loss
Give credit to North Carolina. That's about as bad a loss as I've had in my, what, 14 years here. Our guys played great the whole night. They played a great basketball game, did a lot of really good things. It doesn't really come down to the end of the game, even though they made a very difficult shot and we had a wide-open shot. I know that's how fans look at it. The key play to the game was, we didn't run our press offense and I should've called a timeout. Instead we threw it to a 5-9 guy posted up at the foul line. Those type of things, you can do something about. You can't do anything about the difficult shot Marcus Paige made or the open shot we missed. But it was great game, great atmosphere. Give a lot of credit to North Carolina for coming back. We're playing very good basketball. I'm excited. But also we're hurting very much right now. It stings as much as any game I've coached. Our players are hurt by it. But it's the ACC. There's going to be a lot of games like this. There are a lot of great teams in the ACC and we'll move on from there.
Montrezl Harrell & Chinanu Onuaku's Play
He (Onuaku) played really well. He did a good job and our guards did a great job. We start up top but he (Harrell) ends up down low. He just had a difficult time tonight, defensively moreso than offensively.
Rozier & Jones' Play
Chris and Terry Rozier played great. Chinanu played terrific. This is a game we're going to remember for a long time. It stings. But you can't let it have a hangover. We have to play Virginia Tech coming up, then we have Duke. We let a golden opportunity get away and we're disappointed in that. We had them at 38 percent in the second half and they ended up at 52 percent, so you have to guard them. You have to defend every single possession down the stretch, and we didn't do that. That's a credit to their offense.
[adinserter name=”block 2″]
Fast second half start
We were playing good defense. We stopped them from getting in transition. They didn't get in much transition for the game. That was good. We did a very good job at getting three people back. Look, we can't play any better than that. We didn't execute our press offense well on that one possession. They did exactly what I told them to do, they pushed the pace, they made two passes and we got a wide-open shot. I've got no beefs with the effort. We just have to do a little bit better job of containing the basketball because Nanu got caught rotating so much and helping out because our veterans got beat off the bounce.
Paige's game winning shot
We were trying to trap it, but we had a 6-10 guy who got off his feet and Paige made a very difficult shot. He makes that shot, going to his left. We should've trapped it, but Terry couldn't get over the screen. Nanu did exactly what he was supposed to do. That was a much more difficult shot than Wayne Blackshear's shot.

Say goodbye to authentic New Orleans. Gentrification on a national scale is rapidly remaking the landscape. The influx from America's urban alpha dogs:
"You're trying to run us out of New Orleans," she said. "Out of here. You know we can't afford $287,000." That's what a nearby house recently sold for. High dollar for what Treme is used to, but cheap for people coming from Los Angeles or New York. And increasingly, real estate agent Eric Wilkinson said, people are. "This is by far the most active the market's ever been, in at least the last decade," he said. "The most people moving to New Orleans, buying in New Orleans." He says New Orleans has joined the "it" list, with cities like San Francisco and Austin, but cheaper. And those with fresh eyes have an advantage over natives. "I mean, when you call a street Rampart, which literally means barrier, and people grow up thinking 'don't go across Rampart Street,'" he said. "Whereas people from out of town don't have those preconceived notions. It makes it easier for them to take the leap of faith."

Emphasis added. That's what I mean by gentrification on a national scale. Talent refined in New York City or Los Angeles will overwhelm parochial real estate such as the homes found in New Orleans. In essence, the source of income is untethered from neighborhood. Long-term residents don't have access to the high-paying jobs of a global labor market. Most people everywhere don't have that kind of opportunity.
Given the attraction and inexpensive shelter, disposable income abounds. That means restaurants and consumer city. Not your Rust Belt town's family Italian dive for the working class:
Economically speaking, the restaurant boom is a barometer of a city that is more affluent and more educated than it used to be. “Richer cities have more restaurants per capita,” said Jed Kolko, the chief economist of Trulia, the real estate website, who said New Orleans already ranked 14th in the nation on restaurants per person in 2010, just a few years into the recent boom (San Francisco was No. 1). At the same time, the high concentration of restaurants here has built on itself, as chefs are attracted to a city where eating out is so popular and the most successful ones expand. In that sense, it represents an industry cluster along the lines of the financial industry on Wall Street or high technology in Silicon Valley. More than 10 percent of the jobs in the metropolitan area are in the restaurant business, compared with an average of 8.2 percent nationwide. “The main difference between those clusters and the restaurant cluster is they're all selling a service outside the city,” said Enrico Moretti, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. But to the degree that the restaurants provide food to tourists, he said, they can be counted as exporters. New Orleans may not have much of a manufacturing base, but it sells boatloads of gumbo to millions of visitors. ... ... Thanks to the rebuilding boom after the storm, New Orleans largely escaped the recession, losing far fewer jobs than the country as a whole. But the city lost many of its poor families and attracted, in their stead, what are sometimes called YURPs: Young Urban Rebuilding Professionals. Though the median household income in New Orleans is still below the national average, the population has more college degrees and more households that earn over $75,000 a year than it did before the storm. The city is also attracting experienced restaurant workers like Elle Nihill, who moved from the District of Columbia two months ago in hopes of finding a bartending job but, for now, is waiting tables at Marti's in the French Quarter.
Goodness gracious me, the juiciest article passage I've read since I've started writing at Pacific Standard. New Orleans is a gold mine of talent geography. I'll start with Moretti's comment. Destination restaurants are tradable, similar to eds and meds in Pittsburgh attracting people from out of state. I'll go out on a limb and claim Moretti is wrong. I blame national scale gentrification and greater disposable income. Why quibble? The same global forces are at play. Fair enough, I concede the point.
Now onto YURPs and burps, who gets to staff these tradable restaurants? Sticking with Moretti and those Innovation Economy multipliers:
The bright-side-of-life school argues, au contraire, that the benefits will continue to trickle, if not exactly as palatably as the 1990s optimists envisioned them. That school includes Enrico Moretti, a labor economist at the University of California, Berkeley, writing for the Wall Street Journal last September: “For each new software designer hired at Twitter in San Francisco, there are five new job openings for baristas, personal trainers, therapists and taxi drivers.”
Dismissive and scathing, I know that tone of voice. That's The Weekly Standard fist-bumping Karl Marx. Whatever pinkos are writing for that rag these days should have interviewed (see above) Elle "Trickle Down" Nihill:
“I had a 12-top last night, they had seven bottles of wine, the check hit $1,350, and they didn't even do dessert,” Ms. Nihill reported happily. Would she advise her friends in the industry to move down? “I'm already telling them, get here,” she said. “On this whole staff, only two people are from New Orleans.”
Emphasis added. YURPs aren't the first wave of gentrification, urban pioneers. They are the servant class for the beneficiaries of The New Geography of Jobs. They are underemployed college graduates, gentrifiers and gentrified, who will relocate across the country for tips. They compete with the Big Easy natives for the crumbs of globalization.
Across the road and below the ground pic.twitter.com/E2DG8EzaXg — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 30, 2017
The location makes sense, considering the company transported Godot to SpaceX's Hawthorne offices in April. Musk even submitted plans to local officials, asking permission to build a pedestrian tunnel from the SpaceX building to its parking lot across the road. By that time, The Boring Company was already done digging a vertical shaft for it.
Musk's main goal is to dig tunnels under all of LA that can be used to transport cars, bikes and even people in order to reduce traffic congestion above ground. If the first segment truly is located on SpaceX property, though, the company could begin by building a 500-foot-long, horizontal pedestrian tunnel for the space corporation's employees. We'll definitely know soon enough, since the SpaceX chief said the segment's car/pod elevator "should be operating next week."
White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway on Friday offered her colleagues some advice about how to approach President Donald Trump in the wake of a staff shake-up that left former chief of staff Reince Priebus out in the cold.
Conway on Fox News cited a conversation she had with Trump in August 2016 when she joined his campaign.
“I said to him something that day I'm going to repeat now, to my colleagues in the White House,” she said.
Conway said she told Trump she would never address him by his first name and told him, “I don't consider myself your peer.”
“And he said, ‘Okay, that sounds great.' I mean, he's a very positive person, frankly, a great boss for women,” she said.
Conway said she made the remark “to set up that level of deference and humility when you've got someone who's your boss.”
“Now the President of the United States, now the chief of staff, a general, a secretary, who is clearly your senior, you know, your superior,” she went on.
“Don't read into that, everybody,” Conway added. “Stop. Put your keyboards down, that's not about anyone.”
The bike, to be displayed at next week's Cycle Show at Earls Court in London, also boasts a caterpillar track for smooth riding over potholed roads.
Named the BOND (Built of Notorious Deterrents) Bike, the cycle is the creation of insurer ilovemybike.co.uk, which was inspired to build it after asking 800 cyclists to state their least favourite aspect of life on two wheels.
The flame-thrower was included as 52% of cyclists named ''cars and lorries passing too close'' as their number one complaint. So the bike's handlebars are fitted with a specially-designed flame-thrower to fire towards vehicles that get too close.
A quarter cited poor road conditions such as potholes as a problem, so the bike is fitted with an all-terrain caterpillar track in place of its rear wheel.
With 7% worried most about their bicycle being stolen, the bike is fitted with an ejector seat to catch out any thief that gets past a conventional lock.
Also, 2% of respondents felt cold weather conditions were the most irksome aspect of cycling, so the bike carries a ski blade that can be interchanged with the front wheel
Andrew Davis, director at ilovemybike.co.uk, said: ''Wannabe James Bonds will be disappointed to hear that we have no plans to sell the BOND Bike, but it shouldn't be necessary for cyclists to resort to flame-throwers to get a little consideration on the roads.''
Heavy Duty Touring Racks " If You Want Something Done Right, You Have To Do It Yourself " When I first began bicycle touring, I was pretty-well sold on the idea of an extremely light, minimalist approach. I even shunned a sleeping bag, instead donning all my cold-weather cycling clothes at night and rolling up in a sheet of 4-mil plastic vapour-barrier. Many times I was up at 4 A.M., shivering and soaked in condensation, forced to get on the bike and hammer down the road, in an effort to get warm. Obviously this wasn¹t a plan I could¹ve continued long-term (a 'Spartan' existence is best appreciated in small doses), so gradually I added bits and pieces for trips farther-afield, when I was on the road for longer periods. Presently I prefer long trips that are free from a 'city-to-city' mode of touring. I enjoy the independence (not to mention the economy) of being able to pull off anywhere for the night, and still be well-fed, warm, and comfortable. I¹m no longer a minimalist; I take what I need to be "at home" anywhere. This new approach has not been free of problems, though. On several of my tours in Asia and Australia I've been forced to carry up to 17 liters of water, not to mention 3-4 day's food, fuel for my stove, camping gear, tools, spares and all the rest, and I've yet to come across an aluminum rack that didn't break under the strain. I've spoken to a lot of other cyclists who do similar tours, and they all have disaster stories to relate: of time wasted looking for a welder, or of being marooned on the side of a road or trail mending broken racks with splints and wire cut out of fences, even wrapping spare spokes and twisting them, 'rebar' fashion, to keep the whole together - honestly, what good is a manufacturer's guarantee, when you're stuck way-the-hell out in the middle of nowhere? I've seen expensive panniers patched with duct tape or secured on with shoelaces or inner-tubes, and once even a bound-and-knotted arrangement that utilized a pair of XC-ski long underwear! Those very up-market Gordon and Sakkit racks are out of my reach, price-wise; no point in even thinking about them. The money I'd have to spend, including exchange, duty, and shipping would keep me literally for months in India. I think it makes much more sense to save the money, to invest in Goan beer. So, to put an end to failures at the most inopportune time (as if there could ever be an opportune one), and considering the implausibility of my owning those beautifully-crafted tubular 'Cro-Moly' racks you Yanks make, I decided to cobble together my own racks and panniers. I no longer put any faith in aluminum as a material for racks, so I chose 1" x 1/8" '316' stainless-steel bar stock. I chose "316" Stainless Steel because of its high Nickel and Chromium content, which makes it highly resistant to corrosion. If I had to do it all over again, a choice of 3/4" rather than 1" x 1/8" flat bar stock would reduce the weight by 25%. However, I've no inclination to abandon what I've already made, since it has proven itself to be up to the task. I realize this translates as heavy, and it is, relative to the Blackburn's and Nagaoka's that I used-and-abused previously. But the finished articles are fairly close to the published weights of the aluminum Jandd racks, found in the Rivendell catalogue.
By Paul Woloshansky
On July 23, two high-speed trains that the government had touted as the most advanced in the world collided near the coastal city of Wenzhou in eastern China, an accident that left 40 people dead and 191 injured, according to official tally. The officials claimed that a serious design flaw in signaling equipment was the major cause of the tragedy after originally claiming that lightning disrupted the system.
Within hours of the accident, the Central Propaganda Department, the Information Office, and other governmental agencies jointly issued directions to journalists on how to and what to report. This kind of governmental intention to cover up incidents that may unveil officials' scandals is not new to anyone familiar with the Chinese state control of social media. However, what is different this time is that Chinese citizens are able to use Twitter-like microblog (“weibo” in Chinese pinyin) to carry out public debates and voice their discontent with governmental mismanagement and lack of transparency.
This is the second wave of serious public discontent with the state's authoritative practices of the year after the Arab Spring-inspired call for a “Jasmine Revolution” in mainland China in March.
Reporters arriving on the scene the day after the accident found state-employed crews busy burying the wrecked carriages in the mud, as if to conceal the evidence. Rescue workers seemed to be more interested in restoring rail service than in rescuing wounded passengers. The official death toll was thought to be highly volatile and not to be trusted, and many suspects that a cover-up was underway from the commencement of the relief efforts.
Wang Qinglei, producer of China Central Television (CCTV)'s 24 Hours, was fired after criticizing the government in the state media outlet.
On July 26, law firms in Wenzhou received an “urgent document” from the Wenzhou Judicial Bureau and the Wenzhou Lawyers' Association ordering the lawyers to “report to the judicial bureau and lawyers' association immediately after the injured passengers and families of the deceased in the accident come for legal help.” It also stated that lawyers “shouldn't respond and handle the cases in an unauthorized manner,” as “the accident is a major sensitive issue concerning social stability.”
It took Premier Wen Jiabao, who frequently arrives at disaster-stricken areas in China to make commitments on behalf of the government, six days to visit the accident scene, whereupon he pledged a greater focus on rail safety and a “transparent” investigation into the accident. Wen claimed that he was seriously ill. However, a look at his activities suggests that he had been attending State Council meetings, a climate change workshop, and meeting Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki during the six-day period.
In the past, the state was able to promptly eradicate almost any politically sensitive content on the Internet, but now the Chinese microblog users have found a counter-measure to voice their opinions.
Unlike conventional posting online, microblog posts spread faster than censors can react, making posting politically sensitive contents beyond easy control. Another factor making controlling microblogs a delicate matter is their mushrooming popularity ever since they were introduced to the mainland last year. According to the China Internet Network Information Center estimate, the number of registered microblog users surged by 208.9 percent in the first half of this year, hitting 195 million by the end of June.
Shortly after the train accident and the original official allegation that the tragedy was caused by a disruptive lightning storm, a microblogger wrote, “When a country is so corrupt that one lightning strike can cause a train crash … none of us is immune. China today is a train rushing through a lightning storm … we are all passengers.”
The state gradually acknowledged that strong public dissent was only on the rise, as manifested in angry microblog posts, and that covering up or circumventing the issue would be counterproductive at best. Despite initial official mandate on reporting per the official voice, the state-owned Xinhua news agency released a report titled How Did the Major Disaster on July 23 Happen?, raising many difficult and even strident questions about the train accident. On July 28, the judicial bureau of Wenzhou posted an official document on their website apologizing for “lax supervision” over the Wenzhou Lawyers' Association, which mandated Wenzhou law firms not to handle cases involving the July 23 train clash in an “unauthorized manner.” As of July 30, 10 families have agreed to settle for a compensation of $143,000 per deceased family member, nearly double the originally proposed $78,000.
Qian Gang of the University of Hong Kong discovered that Chinese newspapers on July 29 reached nearly the same depth of reporting and criticism of the incident as their counterparts in Hong Kong, where information regarding accidents is promptly disclosed for public scrutiny.
“Microblogs provided a platform for civic debate on the governmental handling of the train accident, but their influence have been overlooked by many governmental officials,” said Professor Xie Yungeng at Shanghai Communications University. Xie also added that “Some officials don't even know what microblogs are. They lack an awareness of new media. They are too arrogant to care.”
This Tuesday, the People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)'s flagship newspaper, published an article titled How to communicate with masses in microblog era (in English), urging officials to respond to Internet users in a timely fashion and not to evade difficult questions.
On the same day, the State Council and the CCP Central Committee jointly ordered increased transparency in governmental handling of major accidents.
Among the Chinese public, the “appetite for the truth” is looming large. Microblogging provides one such venue for the people to question the wrongdoing of the authority, as well as to share opinions and carry out debates on issues of public concern. With the emergence of microblogs as China's watchdog service, the Chinese authorities should realize that more openness might be conducive to the Party's first and foremost goal of maintaining social stability.
Deolalikar's Claim: One Year Later
Still no final chapter, lessons learned
Vinay Deolalikar just over a year ago claimed that he had a proof that .
Today I want to make a short comment on the status of his claim.
I recently received an email asking: Has the anniversary slipped your notice?
No. But there is not a lot to say about the situation—for better or for worse. Here is all that we know publicly:
His web page still claims the result, and explains that it is out to a journal for the standard refereeing process.
A few weeks ago when I inquired “what is up with the proof,” his e-mail reply said the same thing. He still believes that he has a proof, and reiterated that it is being checked by referees.
He has expanded and updated the paper, and claims to have answered all the issues that were raised on the web here and elsewhere.
He will not let the public see his proof, nor will he post it, so it remains an unknown.
Lessons
Ken and I learned several lessons from last year's event.
There is immense interest in the problem. This surprised us to some degree. We know the problem is important, is intriguing, and is hard. But we had no idea that so many people would be interested in the prospect of a proof.
There is immense power in the web as a method of understanding mathematical claims. The proof attempt was read by many, and this quickly led to insights about it. From Fields Medalists to professional mathematicians to amateurs, all helped with the analysis of the claim. We were amazed at the power of the crowd in this situation.
There is immense difficulty in explaining a new proof, especially for someone who primarily works in another area. We believe that Vinay's main area of expertise is not computational complexity. Thus, it is to be expected that he might have trouble in quickly explaining the key insight that could make his proof work. Perhaps more immediately, this may cause trouble understanding the objections raised.
The online community desires quick reactions and assessments. However, intricate mathematical arguments by their nature do not allow for them. What happens is that every word acquires a very high “slope.” Change the perceived meaning of a phrase a little from the intended meaning, and you have a wide difference in collective understanding. This happened with the word “serious” and even the word “proof” itself. The same slope applied to our own ethical decisions about presentation, not always to everyone's liking.
There is joy in grappling with new challenges, and feeling that others in a world community are pulling with you. This is so even if the evaluation of these challenges finds flaws in their ultimate objective. It is a realm where intellectual honesty prevails, and that is the gold standard of our field. This and our second point above were the aspects noted by popular author Steven Landsburg here.
A Worry
My biggest worry about all this is that claims of a major result should be resolved in a timely fashion, since otherwise unpleasant claims of credit and priority may arise.
I worked years ago on an open problem in the area of decision procedures. I proved an lower bound on the so-called Vector Addition Reachability Problem. See my earlier discussion for the details. While I proved a lower bound, for quite a while there was no upper bound—the problem could have been undecidable.
Here is what I said happened: (The proofs are of the decidability of the problem.)
In act II, two proofs were found: the first by Ernst Mayr and shortly thereafter a proof by Rao Kosaraju. Many did not believe Mayr's proof, since it was unclear in many places. Understanding these long complex arguments, with many interlocking definitions and lemmas, is difficult. Kosaraju created his proof because he felt Mayr's proof was wrong. You can imagine there was an immediate controversy. Which proof was right? Both? Neither? There were claims that Kosaraju's proof was essentially Mayr's proof, but written in a clear way. The controversy got messy very quickly. Finally, in act III there is now a new proof by Jérôme Leroux that seems much cleaner. and more likely to be correct. More on this in the future.
I would hate to see this happen with the much more important problem of . I also notice that I still owe a discussion of Leroux's proof that the problem is decidable. Oh well.
Of course, unlike the vector-addition case, there is no compelling sign of a proof here. However, there may be substantial contributions, perhaps new conditional results, that can possibly come from the work. This may be where the worry most applies. If there is something in Vinay Deolalikar's long paper, then this is worth attending to, and the first onus is on the author.
Open Problems
How should we remember the event last year? Are there other lessons to be taken away?
Advertisements
There is no better, more thorough history of the Mayan site of Palenque than George and David Stuart's Palenque: Eternal City of the Maya. The Stuart's, both experts on the Maya in general and the site of Palenque in particular, manage to condense their expansive knowledge of the site into a relatively brief 243 pages that cover everything from architecture to royal family lineages.
Having said that, the book is not without its flaws. First, the book does not start with the Mayan history of the site. I expected to jump right in and immediately begin learning about the ancient Mayan kings who lived at Palenque and what life was like at the site. Unfortunately the book begins with the history of the European discovery of Palenque after it had been abandoned in the jungle for 1000 years. It next goes on to the history of the archaeological work at the site. It's not until page 106, over a third of the way through the book, that the reader is finally introduced to the Maya themselves who built and lived at Palenque.
Furthermore, the authors recount this history in a linear, textbook style; i.e., “this happened, then this happened, then this happened,” etc. This makes it a rather dull read, definitely not a page turner. In addition, the book is written in a dry, academic style. These facts make the book one that really requires some work on the reader's part to trudge through its pages. I found myself re-reading passages in order to fully understand them. Worse, the authors often referred back to previous chapters assuming the reader would remember every detail of its dry, academic facts instead of simply restating what the authors wanted the reader to remember. Considering I had read some of these chapters days earlier it was difficult to remember precisely what the authors were referring to without going back and re-reading these passages.
All of this results in a book that feels more like reading an autopsy of a dead city rather than learning about the vibrant, living city that Palenque once was. This is not a problem unique to this book but to history books in general. It is rare to find one that really breathes life into its subject. Thus if you are a fan of history you will likely find this book no worse than any other book on ancient history.
The biggest oversight comes from a lack of any mention as to the source of Palenque's great wealth. The book fails to answer two of the most important of the 5 w's (who, what, when, where, & why) every good book should answer: Why was Palenque such a large and prosperous city and what was the source of its great wealth? Most cities become rich through trade yet no mention of trade found its way into this volume. In fact, the word “trade” is not even in the book's index. This is quite a glaring oversight equivalent to writing a history of Detroit without mentioning the automobile industry or a history of Los Angeles without mention the entertainment industry or a history of New York City without mentioning the financial industry. Every city has its reason for being yet we never get even the slightest sense of Palenque's reason for being.
The authors approach the subject of trade on multiple occasions but never dive in. For instance, they note in this passage:
“Palenque's situation on the border between two enormously different environmental zones, the vast plain on the north and highlands immediately south, gave it the advantage of exploiting both lowland and highland resources. The city also lies on the geographical divide between two drainage systems, one flowing west and the other east. Awareness of both these benefits may well have helped Palenque's first settlers select the place.”
Yet this passage fails to mention what these resources were or how their exploitation was of any benefit to Palenque. Did this location enable them to become the middle men in a vast trade network? Or was their some local resource that was valuable which the inhabitants of Palenque exported to other localities? Today the primary means of creating wealth is either by being a distributor of other people's goods (Wal-Mart) or by the creation and export of your own goods (Apple). So which was it at Palenque?
On two other occasions the authors hint at trade but again fail to dig deeper. On pp. 142-143 they note:
“Uk'aychan…may have been reaching westward in order to control lucrative trade routes and resources in the Palenque region….”
Yet the authors make no mention of what items were traded or what resources were such valuable commodities. And on p. 164 they note:
“Another subsidiary community was Xupa, located on the opposite eastern side of Palenque's domain. Today, it is a moderate and little investigated ruin, with sculpted fragments also in the Palenque mode. Xupa's location in the fertile Chancala Valley suggests that it was used to control and administer the region's important agricultural productivity.”
But this passage fails to answer any important questions like what agricultural products were produced and were they used locally or exported? Was this the source of Palenque's wealth or was there some other source?
The closest the book comes to discussing trade is when it discusses the ceramic record of the city. For instance, the authors note:
“By AD 400, the community had grown considerably….The sudden appearance at this time of pottery from the Peten region to the east helps define the Motiepa phase, a period of some two centuries that witnessed the maturing of the city as a major center– and the beginnings of military conflicts with neighbors to the east.”
Yet once again they fail to dig deeper to explain this transformation of Palenque into a “major center.” Was trade in ceramics the cause of this transformation or simply a result? Another example:
“The 7th century AD corresponds with the renaissance of the kingdom as a major political force….This Otolum ceramic phase reflects both stability and prosperity in the sheer variety of local wares– and a dramatic increase in the importing of fine polychrome vases by the status-conscious elite.”
Again, was Palenque a center of the ceramic trade or was this increase the result of wealth created from other ventures? The authors fail to provide any deeper insight into the source of Palenque's wealth and thus the whole underpinning of its existence. Another example:
“The 8th century at Palenque, corresponding generally to the ceramic phase named for the Murcielagos River…half a century of excavation there…has uncovered dozens of what surely rank among the most spectacular examples of ceramic art ever produced by the ancient Maya….These striking objects were locally produced by the hundreds– Rands has identified at least one studio-workshop about 1 km (0.6 mile) east of the Palace….”
But as usual the authors fail to explain why the people at Palenque were producing such fabulous pottery. Were they trading it and thus creating wealth from it or did their wealth come from some other source which then afforded them the luxury of fine ceramics? Another example:
“The final discernible ceramic phase of Palenque, the Balunte (c. AD 770-850), saw increased interactions with communities on the plains to the north…”
Again, the authors explain little about the nature of these “increased interactions.” Were they trade related? Was Palenque exporting ceramics to these communities or importing ceramics from these communities?
And one final example from p. 233:
“The elegantly shaped ceramic vessel is made from a distinctive fine grey paste that comes from the Tabasco plains, to the north of Palenque, which was widely imported during the Balunte ceramic phase.”
Was the clay imported to create vessels for export or were the vessels consumed only at Palenque? Again, the reader is left with more questions than answers and has no better idea the “why” and “what” of Palenque as when they first opened the book.
Amazingly, even though the authors discuss the ceramic/pottery traditions that mark important changes at Palenque, few photos of this pottery were included in the book– a major oversight.
Probably one of the more fascinating topics was the interaction between Palenque and the metropolis of Teotihuacan in central Mexico. The fact that many Mayan sites appear to have been either conquered or greatly influenced by this great city so far away hints at a much more far flung trade network and interaction sphere than most believe was present in the New World before the arrival of Europeans. But again, the authors do not delve too deeply into this subject.
Without this discussion of trade the reader is left with a dry account of buildings and kings and little more. The few mentions of warfare help breathe life into the dead skeletons of Palenque's history but discussion of trade would have helped even more so.
The author's did manage to bring in a few nice touches like:
“To this day, many traditional Maya peoples see mountains as the dwelling places of their ancestors, the ‘mothers-and-fathers,' who exert a profound spiritual influence over the lives of the descendants who hold them in high esteem.”
Passages such as this help connect the present with the past and in so doing helps connect the reader to the humanity of the people they are reading about. The skeletons at Palenque were once living, breathing people with motivations identical to those of people today. The more the authors could have made of that connection between the past and present, the better their book would have been.
But as it stands, Palenque: Eternal city of the Maya is an invaluable reference that I will undoubtedly return to time and time again when I need to research information about Palenque.

El movimiento obrero bajo Trump
15/11/2016 | Buzz Malone
La elección de Donald Trump significa que ha llegado verdaderamente el momento de organizarse o morir para el movimiento obrero.
Hace muchos años, hablé ante un grupo de dirigentes sindicales. Les hablé sobre la historia del movimiento obrero, y sobre cómo to-dos amamos y reverenciamos al movimiento de antaño. Les hablé sobre cómo alabamos y adoramos la época de los levantamientos obreros contra la maquinaria del status quo y a los héroes que emergieron como líderes de aquellos movimientos.
Y entonces les dije que si no estábamos precavidos, el siguiente levantamiento obrero sería contra nosotros. Les advertí sobre los peligros de acabar tan entrelazados en la tela del establishment que la clase obrera no fuese capaz de discernir las diferencias entre ambos.
Que conste que mi discurso de aquel día no fue bien recibido. De hecho, ahora que lo pienso, transcurrió un periodo de tiempo bastante largo hasta que me volvieron a pedir que dijese algo de nuevo ante un grupo. Pero eso no lo hace menos verdadero, incluso aunque no quieran oírlo.
Las elecciones de la pasada noche, en mi opinión, son un signo de ese tipo de levantamiento. No hace falta analizar ni diseccionar las elecciones en su conjunto. Ya hay demasiados supuestos expertos haciéndolo. Y el tiempo nos dirá demasiado pronto lo que significa para el movimiento obrero organizado vivir bajo el nuevo todopoderoso régimen republicano. Pero ha habido un montón de palabras sobre la América blanca, y esto es algo sobre lo que sé un poco.
Sí, un pequeño segmento de los partidarios de Trump son fanáticos. Y algunos son racistas. Pero la amplia mayoría no es ninguna de las dos cosas. Viviendo aquí en Iowa, en una comunidad blanca rural dentro de un Estado principalmente blanco, conozco a esa gente. La mayoría no es ninguna de esas cosas. Y cuando la camioneta con la imagen de Trump llegó a mi colegio electoral, no salió de ella un enfadado redneck con pistola que odia a los inmigrantes, sino un sindicalista que llevaba una cazadora de voluntario del Comité de Acción Política del sindicato de empleados públicos AFSCME.
Más que nada, estas elecciones (desde mi punto de vista) iban sobre la gente que está disgustada con el status quo. Gente que había estado poco o nada interesada en votar llegó y votó porque los precios de sus seguros médicos se habían disparado (culpaban al Obamacare) o porque recordaban cómo perdieron sus trabajos industriales cuando el NAFTA de Bill Clinton entró en vigor. Muchos de ellos fueron demócratas en su día (o aún lo son). Votaron en abrumador número, no por Trump, sino sobre to-do contra lo que perciben como la candidata nominada por el establishment que les aprieta la garganta.
Incluso entre miembros de los sindicatos, el disgusto por este ciclo era palpable. Y a pesar de los movimientos populistas en ambas direcciones anti-establishment (Trump y Bernie Sanders), la mayoría de las cúpulas sindicales abrazó aún más a los candidatos del establishment, alejando más si cabe a la militancia a ambos lados del centro.
Hay un principio de la organización sindical que dice que una vez identificas a los individuos que más vehementemente se te oponen, evitas el contacto con ellos para evitar que se enfaden tanto que lleguen a votar contra ti. El movimiento obrero, en cambio, siguió adelante, y mandamos los habituales e-mails, llamamos a las habituales puertas e hicimos las habituales llamadas telefónicas. El resultado fue, bueno, Trump.
Y cuando aquellos de nosotros que hemos estado en una dirección sindical reconocemos la importancia de estar implicados en el proceso político y el daño que la derecha intenta infligirnos a la primera oportunidad que tiene, nuestra militancia ha llegado ampliamente a la conclusión de que la maquinaria del movimiento obrero organizado es poco más que un brazo financiero del Partido Demócrata. Quiero decir, de verdad, ¿dónde puedes encontrar un modelo de negocio donde se inviertan diez o veinte millones de dólares por ciclo, no se obtenga absolutamente nada de él, y se piense que es prudente seguir y doblar la inversión en el siguiente ciclo?
Aunque estemos de acuerdo o en desacuerdo con su sabiduría, la militancia, y el pueblo de este país, han acabado anhelando otra cosa –casi cualquier otra cosa–. Y en un mundo donde la percepción es realidad, y donde el populismo es ahora el rey, contentarse con permitir la percepción que existe de que todo nuestro futuro como movimiento depende de cada ciclo electoral, y de que nuestra única esperanza es elegir cada vez más demócratas, es una receta demasiado aparente para el desastre.
Nuestro futuro como movimiento obrero organizado dependerá ahora, más bien, de nuestra habilidad para movilizar verdaderamente y luchar una barbaridad por nuestra supervivencia en cada frente. Wisconsin es aquí y ahora para todos nosotros. Si no podemos cambiar, y rápidamente, una situación en la que nos limitamos a ofrecer servicios a nuestra militancia y poner toda nuestra energía política colectiva en el proceso electoral, entonces me temo que habrá poco por lo que luchar cuando las aguas vuelvan a su cauce.
Históricamente, este movimiento populista no tiene precedentes. E históricamente, el movimiento obrero organizado siempre ha corrido desde atrás para alcanzar este tipo de movimientos cuando ocurren.
Nuestra acción, o falta de ella, en los próximos meses, determinará el destino del movimiento que nuestros hijos y nietos en última instancia heredarán. Solo espero que la cúpula sindical lo reconozca antes de que sea demasiado tarde, y empiece a planificar la contingencia hoy, en lugar de enfocarse solamente en el próximo ciclo en dos años, porque hoy, la gente es más valiosa para nosotros que los dólares para las campañas electorales, y nuestra capacidad para formar un movimiento real para responder a los ataques es más urgente que preguntarse qué demócrata concurrirá a las siguientes elecciones en dos años.
¿Dónde estaremos cuando Trump nombre a Scott Walker para encabezar el Departamento de Trabajo? ¿O cuando sea anulada la jornada laboral en el sector público federal? ¿O cuando to-dos nosotros tengamos que celebrar elecciones anuales para recertificar nuestros contratos?
Todas estas cosas serán las que influyan en cambiar el sentido de un futuro ciclo electoral, pero en el aquí y el ahora, es de lejos un precio demasiado alto para una victoria demócrata que servirá meramente para detener la hemorragia.
Es verdaderamente el momento de organizar o morir, y eso no significa simplemente afiliar nuevos militantes, significa movilizar a to-dos ellos para la acción en torno a los temas que les preocupan a ellos, no a nosotros, porque, claramente, debe haber una diferencia entre los dos que hemos perdido a lo largo del camino.

Toronto is searching for four good men. Or four brave women. Or a mix of men and women with foresight, backbone and expertise to help guide Canada's largest city out of jurisdictional and political gridlock. The appointments will be one of city council's most important decisions this term, in that the task involves the future of transit — one of the most vexing concerns for citizens of the Toronto region.
The city is planing to appoint four citizens to the TTC commission, a move that comes at a crucial time for the transit agency, Royson James writes.
The four are being added to the mix of seven councillors who now serve as transit commissioners on the TTC. To say the politicians can be hidebound and partisan, depending on who is pulling their strings, is to understate the current landscape. What is well documented is that we can't always depend on the councillor commissioners to vote what is in the best interest of the public. The result of numerous votes on the issue of subways versus LRT in the last year proves the point. Adding four non-politicians to the commission — four out of 11 — doesn't guarantee anything, except that they should change the dynamics somewhat. They should breathe some new life into the culture, and, if Toronto is extremely fortunate, revitalize the TTC. That will require citizen commissioners of biblical stature. They need the patience of Job, the wisdom of Solomon and the vision of Moses — a wish list of eligibility credentials that is almost too ambitious. Still we dream.

The TTC is at a crucial period. More riders are using it than ever. The city-region is totally dependent on it to get around. Through a budget crunch and political upheaval in the provincial government and false fiscal crises created for political gain, the transit system has endured to remain an essential part of our lives. This past year, the TTC has been cast into another political storm. Politicians loyal to Mayor Rob Ford ignored TTC advice, fired the TTC chief general manager, and in effect delayed transit improvements for at least a couple of years in pursuit of Ford's undeveloped, unfunded, unsupportable and unsustainable transit idea of “subways, subways, subways.” In the end, those politicians — city councillors who double as transit commissioners — were so disruptive and out of sync with city council, that council removed them from the TTC. As part of that action, council voted to expand the commission by adding four citizens, one of whom will be a TTC vice-chair. These new citizen commissioners will be appointed for two terms, or eight years. (The first group start mid-term, Oct. 30, 2012, so will serve six years.) That provides continuity. It also means the citizen appointees may be around long enough to develop their own expertise and should be vaccinated against the political games. Still, it will be a difficult task.
Even as LRT lines are to be constructed along Eglinton, Sheppard East, Finch West and as a replacement for the Scarborough RT, the mayor badmouths the plan, tries to destabilize it, and is crafting a re-election campaign around sinking the LRTs. The appointees will be hobbled by this conflict. Added to their angst is this: It is the provincial agency, Metrolinx, that's in charge of constructing the LRT lines, before turning them over to the TTC for operation. The TTC is concerned about this, but with the mayor publicly willing to divest the entire TTC to the province, the TTC has little weight or pull.
Article Continued Below
Added to this is the prospect that the municipal election campaign will be waged just as construction will tie up traffic on several major streets — a perfect opening for the mayor to claim that subways would avoid all the chaos caused by rail tracks down the middle of our streets. The city plans information sessions Tuesday night at the North York and Scarborough civic centres, 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., for those who think they are cut out for this essential and politically hot battleground. Appointees get $5,000 a year ($10,000 for the vice-chair) plus a $450 per diem per meeting. Application deadline is July 4. To learn more, visit Toronto.ca/public-appointments. Royson James usually appears Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Email: rjames@thestar.ca
Somebody once said that life is high school happening over and over again. It's the boys against the girls, jocks versus the freaks, the cool kids and the nerds. High school is a highly stratified society. The caste system is carved in stone, and there's so much pressure to conform to whichever group one feels the need to belong.
It ain't easy getting through four years of high school without some kind of damage from bullying, mean girls, hazing or any of the other myriad ways kids find to make one another miserable.
Television shows such as "Glee," "Friday Night Lights" and "Freaks and Geeks" have gone a long way toward illustrating the dramatic ups and downs of American high school life. Both middle school and high school can be tough waters to navigate. And social media hasn't made it any easier. In fact, Facebook and Twitter have provided new avenues for inventive forms of social torture.
Case in point:
The students at Bay High School were recently made aware of an anonymous Twitter page dedicated to insulting members of the senior class with hateful, hurtful remarks about students' appearance, intelligence, sexual orientation, race, mental health -- just about anything that could hurt a person's feelings was included in this ugly and nasty diatribe.
The page caught on with the student body, as these salacious things do, and the poisonous tone cast a sickening pall over students who should have been celebrating a very joyous accomplishment.
Then Bay High senior James Roubal came up with an idea. He started another Twitter page called BayHighROCKS. He made the password public and invited all the students of Bay High, not just the seniors, to post comments about the wonderful qualities of their friends and classmates.
You can see the page on Twitter. It turned into a love fest with kids talking glowingly about one another. They describe their friends' loyalty, warmth and supportive natures. They talk about boys and girls who light up a room with their kindness and good cheer. They praise each other's sense of humor and ability to make the best of trying situations.
So what began as something nasty and hurtful was turned into an opportunity for the kids to heal their own wounds and to show appreciation for the love and friendship they all share. It was a wonderful, tangible example of love triumphing over hate.
It's like the ending of a Jimmy Stewart movie. The only thing this story lacks is a musical dance number in front of water fountains.
If life really is high school happening over and over again, then, thanks to James Roubal, the members of the Bay Class of 2013 are some very lucky kids.
Hip Hop is notorious for teasing us with these great projects only for them to never see the light of day. Like a Marvel Team-Up, we salivate over the possibilities of seeing our favorite emcees record a project with another superpower. But maybe the idea sounded good at the time and the parties involved simply couldn't find the artistic space to record what they know fans would love. Or, it could be the dreaded evil known as LABEL POLITICS that pulls down its pants and takes a shit on our dreams. You also have this artist who are simply too bogged down with whatever they have going on in their life where dropping an album is more of a nuisance than a necessity. Over at The House of Dope we compiled our list of fictional albums that we thought we would be gifted with but, for one reason or another, it never happened.
The lore behind Ice Cube and Dr. Dre's mythical collaborative album is, as always, tied to the life and times of NWA. Following his acrimonious split from the group in 1989, Cube and NWA would spend the next few years dissing (and, at the New Music Seminar in 1990, throwing hands at) each other until NWA's own demise in 1991. However, the original members would settle their issues — that is, once Eazy-E fired his longtime manager Jerry Heller — and planned to drop their third album with Cube in the fold (who had been absent since Straight Outta Compton) until Eazy's death in 1995.
However, Dre and Cube had plans to drop Helter Skelter for seemingly decades. Cube made a cameo in Dre's “Let Me Ride” video in 1993, and the two formally reunited on “Natural Born Killaz” in 1994. MC Ren would join the two on 2000's “Hello” and “Chin Check,” and talks of both Helter Skelter and NWA's third album — with Snoop Dogg in the fold, this time — surfaced. Yet, like Detox, Rakim's Oh My God (another album on this list) and countless others, it never came to be. — Meka Udoh
In the 1930s and 1940s, Murder Inc. was the name of organized crime collective of various mob groups in New York. In 1991, it was the name of an industrial music supergroup. In 1995, the name had been co-opted for another potential super-group: Jay-Z, DMX and Ja Rule.
During the nascent stages of their respective careers, the trio would appear on Mic Geronimo's “Time to Build” in 1995, and they would collaborate on a string of heatrocks over a span of five years: “Murdergram,” “It's Murda,” “Time To Build,” “Money Cash Hoes,” Busta Rhymes‘ “Why We Die,” “Grand Finale,” and several others. Yet despite an album's worth of songs together, with each members' individual success an actual album never came to fruition.
“It was a situation where egos all just played a part in its demise,” Ja told MTV. “We couldn't get X and Jay in the same room, from long ago, their storied battle on the pool table, guns out [and] all of that.”
We all know the rest: Jay would become one of music's most successful artists of all time, DMX would battle a variety of demons over the years, and Ja Rule would become a Nigerian scammer now facing multiple lawsuits from the Fyre Festival catastrophe.
The three did reunite, however, backstage at Beyonce's final Formation World Tour stop in 2016.

Once upon a time (around 2005), Juelz Santana was like molten lava hot. Dipset was running shit and it appeared that Santana was going to be a bonafide star. Meanwhile, Lil Wayne began to really pick up steam as a solo act with Tha Carter and Tha Carter II garnering critical acclaim. A collaborative mixtape was announced and fans salivated over the possibilities. However, Lil Wayne became a massive star and that somewhat ground the process of creation to a halt with Weezy recording what felt like an infinite amount of guest spots. According to Santana, label politics managed to finally doom the project. One can only imagine what that mixtape would have done for Santana's career considering that it was at the height of Weezy's rise. — Andreas Hale

Nas and DJ Premier have had a musical relationship that goes back over two decades. Starting with 1994's Illmatic, the two would collaborate on Nas' first five albums, resulting in classic tracks like “Nas Is Like,” “2nd Childhood” and “I Gave You Power.” The two would constantly talk about doing a collaborative album for what's seemed like forever, and yet nothing — absolutely nothing — would come from these talks.
Think about this for a second. Fifteen years after “Boom,” we got a Royce 5'9” x Preemo album, PRhyme . Hell, they even have plans to release a second project together. We even got a Dr. Dre and Preemo collab, “Animals,” off Dre's Compton (which, while it wasn't Detox, was technically the long-awaited follow-up to 2001). Yet, in spite of all of this, Nasir and Chris can't find a studio together? Oh, and let's not forget about Nas and Common‘s Nas.Com, Premier and Pete Rock, and all the other ideas we've been teased with over the years. We need a board. — Meka Udoh
After The Roots released Things Fall Apart to critical acclaim, it felt like the time was right for a Black Thought solo album. A couple of tracks began to float around on the net in the form of “Hardware” and “Mona Lisa.” The buzz began building but once Thought and The Legendary Roots Crew realized that the solo outing wouldn't count towards The Roots contractual obligations to the label and the album was subsequently scrapped. Many of the songs ended up helping shape the Phrenology album. Interestingly enough, isn't every album from The Roots like a solo Black Thought album? Apparently this would have been all about the aesthetics. Oh, and what about Thought's joint project with DangerMouse?! Based on “Mad Nice” with DOOM, Dangerous Thoughts (or whatever they were gonna call it) would've been epic. — Andreas Hale
Here's how long ago Jay Electronica has teased ACT 2…
He once announced the project's release date on his MYSPACE page, y'all. That was a decade ago and we still haven't seen what was supposed to be his debut album. It's hard to believe that a decade has passed since “Exhibit C” was blowing up our speakers. Since then, a million excuses have accompanied the album's hiatus. Everything from a fraudulent collaborative album with Nas and another fictional project with Curren$y and Mos Def as Center Edge Territory were to blame. Tracklists have popped up, everyone from Young Guru to Just Blaze have talked in length about the album and, yet, we haven't seen a gotdamn thing. We could liken this to Dr. Dre's Detox except that at least Dre has dropped an album. — Andreas Hale

After splitting from his longtime partner Eric B. in 1993, Rakim would release his solo debut The 18th Letter in 1997. Following 1999's The Master, Ra would sign to Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment in 2000. Quite literally, the reaction of many to this new union was “Oh my God!” (Dre would even say that this reaction actually inspired the album title, during a radio interview in 2000).
With guest appearances on Truth Hurts' “Addictive,” and Jay-Z' “The Watcher Part 2,” the hype for Oh My God reached a fever pitch. Alas, the Aftermath Curse would hit William Michael Griffin, and he would leave Aftermath in 2003 after citing “creative differences” with Dre. — Meka Udoh
Before these two blew up as emcees making conscious albums that perform exceptionally well in the mainstream (a nod to Kendrick's “Mask Off (Remix)” verse), Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole had been pretty open about dropping an album together as early as 2011. Success may have gotten in the way of these two spending a lot of time in the studio together. However, it's evident when they join forces that there is some magic there. From Cole providing production for K Dot's “HiiiPower” and “The Jig Is Up (Dump'n)” and a couple of songs leaking (“Temptation” and “Shock the World”) to their little switch off of beats with Black Friday in 2015, it appears that the project would come once things settle down. Ab-Soul and Oddisee say the project exists, but nobody has details on if or when it will drop. — Andreas Hale
Remember that time when we got all excited about an MF DOOM and Ghostface album? Then we'd get a song, which appeared to signal that the album's release was near, and then we got nothing. Then it would happen over and over again. It's been over a decade since the two eccentric lyricists teased the project and we've been treated with a few collaborations ranging from 2005's “The Mask” and 2009's “Angela” to 2016's “livelihood.” Still, we haven't had a firm release date. That hasn't stopped Ghostface from talking about it. He'll do a random interview and tease that the release date is near but then we get absolutely nothing. — Andreas Hale
One of the more understated projects on this list could have been one of the best… you know, had it actually come out.
After the two first connected for “Mac & Brad,” off of Beanie's debut album The Truth, the duo — along with Jay-Z — would link up for some of the dopest songs of their generation: “Mom Praying,” “This Can't Be Life,” “Somehow Some Way,” and “Guess Who's Back.” And while Jay would have a falling out with Beans (the two have since reconciled), the potential of a Scarface x Beanie Sigel project seemed all but a reality.
Years after their memorable collaborations, a Mac N Brad album still seemed like it would happen. Both ‘Face and Sigel said that there were about a dozen songs completed in 2012. “We're doin' songs, I got six, he got six,” Scarface said on an episode of RapFix Live. “It's a process that we go through to do this album.” But, like everything on this list, it wasn't meant to be. — Meka Udoh

The sentences of two homophobic thugs have been increased after the government challenged an “unduly lenient” sentence.
18-year-old Gage Vye-Parminter and 19-year-old Matthew Howes were initially sentenced to five years in a young offender institution in January over a homophobic attack on Brighton seafront on May 2 last year.
The pair had hurled anti-gay slurs at victims Dain Finney and James Loxton, 22 and 24, before beating them in a violent attack.
Both victims suffered horrific injuries, with Mr Finney sustaining fractured eye sockets, fractured cheekbones and a fracture to his nose – nearly losing vision in one eye.
The attackers' sentences have this week been increased after the government challenged the court's initial leniency.
The UK's government's Solicitor General Robert Buckland had challenged the “unduly lenient” sentence in the case, which he contends did not reflect the homophobic hate crime element of the case.
The senior government legal chief made an apperance before the Court of Appeal today to personally argue the case.The pair
After the intervention, Vye-Parminter and Howes have now been sentenced to seven years in jail.
Speaking after the hearing, the Solicitor General said: “This vicious attack was totally unprovoked and has left the victims with long-term emotional and physical scars. It will take the victims a considerable amount of time to recover from this.
“I thought the sentence was unduly lenient as it failed to adequately take into account that this attack was motivated by hate.
“I hope the Court's decision to impose a longer prison sentence, to include the sentence uplift, sends a clear message to society that such offences will not be tolerated.”
Taking to Facebook previously, victim Dain Finney recalled: “Two guys decided to shout homophobic comments as we were walking home doing the sensible thing and ignoring it they decided to jump us and kick us in the face.
“I don't know who did but thank you to the people trying to get the guys off us and calling the police.
“Felt pretty lucky going through life not experiencing homophobia and for it to happen in Brighton just goes to show that people still can't be accepting of others.
“No one should ever experience being discriminated against no matter who they are.”
To help you get started with the latest GDELT collection of 3.5 million digitized historical English language books published from 1800-2015 from the Internet Archive and HathiTrust collections, we've included a selection of SQL queries below to show you how to work with the collection in Google BigQuery. Remember that since all of the books were processed using the same GDELT Global Knowledge Graph 2.0 system that we use for daily news articles, all of the BigQuery examples from our Google BigQuery + GKG 2.0: Sample Queries tutorial work here as well, just by changing the FROM field to the following:
Internet Archive: FROM (TABLE_QUERY([gdelt-bq:internetarchivebooks], 'REGEXP_EXTRACT(table_id, r"(d{4})") BETWEEN "1800" AND "2015"'))
FROM (TABLE_QUERY([gdelt-bq:internetarchivebooks], 'REGEXP_EXTRACT(table_id, r"(d{4})") BETWEEN "1800" AND "2015"')) HathiTrust: FROM (TABLE_QUERY([gdelt-bq:hathitrustbooks], 'REGEXP_EXTRACT(table_id, r"(d{4})") BETWEEN "1800" AND "2015"'))
In particular, check out the tutorial for making network diagrams with Gephi the sample queries. Just as a reminder, here are the direct links to the two BigQuery datasets for the Internet Archive and HathiTrust datasets processed by GDELT:
SIMPLE TIMELINES
Here's a simple timeline query to count how many books are in the Internet Archive collection by year:
select DATE,count(1) FROM (TABLE_QUERY([gdelt-bq:internetarchivebooks], 'REGEXP_EXTRACT(table_id, r"(\d{4})") BETWEEN "1800" AND "2015"')) group by DATE order by date
To modify this to count only the number of books by year from 1810 to 1850, you would modify the FROM field like this:
select DATE,count(1) FROM (TABLE_QUERY([gdelt-bq:internetarchivebooks], 'REGEXP_EXTRACT(table_id, r"(\d{4})") BETWEEN "1810" AND "1850"')) group by DATE order by date
And to count the number of books by year in the HathiTrust collection instead, you would modify the FROM field again like this:
select DATE,count(1) FROM (TABLE_QUERY([gdelt-bq:hathitrustbooks], 'REGEXP_EXTRACT(table_id, r"(\d{4})") BETWEEN "1800" AND "2015"')) group by DATE order by date
To estimate the number of likely US Government publications by year in HathiTrust, use this query, which looks for common author and publisher values highly indicative of US Government publications:
select DATE,count(1) FROM (TABLE_QUERY([gdelt-bq:hathitrustbooks], 'REGEXP_EXTRACT(table_id, r"(\d{4})") BETWEEN "1800" AND "2015"')) where BookMeta_Publisher like '%Washington%' or BookMeta_CorporateAuthor like '%United States%' or BookMeta_CorporateAuthor like '%U.S.%' or BookMeta_CorporateAuthor like '%National%' group by DATE order by date
To count the total number of unique Title+Author combinations by year in HathiTrust as a simple naive measure of the number of unique works by year:
select DATE,count(distinct(concat( IFNULL(BookMeta_Title,""), IFNULL(BookMeta_Author,""),IFNULL(BookMeta_CorporateAuthor,"") ))) FROM (TABLE_QUERY([gdelt-bq:hathitrustbooks], 'REGEXP_EXTRACT(table_id, r"(\d{4})") BETWEEN "1800" AND "2015"')) group by DATE order by date
Note the use of the IFNULL() construction within the COUNT(DISTINCT()) – this is because without it, if any of the fields are NULL (such as Corporate Author), then the entire CONCAT() becomes NULL, so this protects the CONCAT() and ensures it has a valid value regardless of whether Title, Author, or CorporateAuthor fields are NULL.
PERSON/ORGANIZATION/THEME HISTOGRAMS
To make a histogram of the top person or organization names identified by GDELT's algorithms from all Internet Archive books published from 1800 to 1820 you would use this query:
SELECT person, COUNT(*) as count FROM ( select UNIQUE(REGEXP_REPLACE(SPLIT(V2Persons,';'), r',.*', "")) person FROM (TABLE_QUERY([gdelt-bq:internetarchivebooks], 'REGEXP_EXTRACT(table_id, r"(\d{4})") BETWEEN "1800" AND "1820"')) ) group by person ORDER BY count DESC limit 10000
You should get a list like this:
Row person count 1 Jesus Christ 6686 2 Queen Elizabeth 3465 3 Christ Jesus 3035 4 King James 2524 5 Virgin Mary 2504 6 Queen Anne 2225 7 King Charles 2006 8 King William 1956 9 Isaac Newton 1913 10 Queen Mary 1869 11 Julius Caesar 1747 12 William Jones 1601 13 Oliver Cromwell 1592 14 King John 1442 15 King Henry 1404 16 King Edward 1334
Note the emphasis on religious persons and English leaders like Jesus Christ and Queen Elizabeth. To repeat the query for books published 1900 to 1920, you would just modify the FROM clause:
SELECT person, COUNT(*) as count FROM ( select UNIQUE(REGEXP_REPLACE(SPLIT(V2Persons,';'), r',.*', "")) person FROM (TABLE_QUERY([gdelt-bq:internetarchivebooks], 'REGEXP_EXTRACT(table_id, r"(\d{4})") BETWEEN "1900" AND "1920"')) ) group by person ORDER BY count DESC limit 10000
This time the list includes more American leaders like Abraham Lincoln, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams. You will also find some false positives in the list like Los Angeles due to OCR error confusing the algorithms.
To repeat this analysis, but for HathiTrust books published 1800-1810, just modify the FROM clause again:
SELECT person, COUNT(*) as count FROM ( select UNIQUE(REGEXP_REPLACE(SPLIT(V2Persons,';'), r',.*', "")) person FROM (TABLE_QUERY([gdelt-bq:hathitrustbooks], 'REGEXP_EXTRACT(table_id, r"(\d{4})") BETWEEN "1800" AND "1820"')) ) group by person ORDER BY count DESC limit 10000
The list should not be too different from the one you received from Internet Archive books, but with a few subtle differences reflecting the slightly different compositions of the two collections.
BOOK METADATA HISTOGRAMS
Most of the BookMeta_* fields use semicolons to delimit multiple entries. Thus, to find the top subject tags for Internet Archive books published 1855-1875:
SELECT subject, COUNT(*) as count FROM ( select UNIQUE(SPLIT(BookMeta_Subjects,';')) subject FROM (TABLE_QUERY([gdelt-bq:internetarchivebooks], 'REGEXP_EXTRACT(table_id, r"(\d{4})") BETWEEN "1855" AND "1875"')) ) group by subject ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 300
You should get results that look like:
Row subject count 1 null 59121 2 Lincoln, Abraham, 1809-1865 2079 3 Bible 1515 4 Hymns, English 1205 5 Slavery 940 6 Slavery — United States 703 7 United States — Politics and government 1861-1865 683 8 Science 642 9 bub_upload 614 10 Presidents 585
Note the high number of NULL results for books that did not have any library-provided subject tags. For those books with subject tags, Abraham Lincoln, Slavery, and US Politics predictably dominate these two decades, which center on the American Civil War.
MAPPING BOOKS
Using the example of the American Civil War, the query below filters to all Internet Archive books published between 1855 and 1875 that contain a library-provided subject tag that contains any of the phrases "Civil War", "Lincoln", "Slavery", "Confedera" (matches Confederacy, Confederate, etc), "Antislavery", or "Reconstruction". All geographic locations mentioned anywhere in the text of the books is compiled and those locations appearing in at least 4 books and 4 times overall are kept, with their latitude and longitude rounded to three decimals.
select lat,long, cnt, numbooks from ( SELECT lat,long, COUNT(*) as cnt, count(distinct(BookMeta_Identifier)) as numbooks FROM ( select BookMeta_Identifier, ROUND(FLOAT(REGEXP_EXTRACT(SPLIT(V2Locations,';'),r'^[2-5]#.*?#.*?#.*?#.*?#(.*?)#.*?#')),3) as lat, ROUND(FLOAT(REGEXP_EXTRACT(SPLIT(V2Locations,';'),r'^[2-5]#.*?#.*?#.*?#.*?#.*?#(.*?)#')),3) AS long FROM (TABLE_QUERY([gdelt-bq:internetarchivebooks], 'REGEXP_EXTRACT(table_id, r"(\d{4})") BETWEEN "1855" AND "1875"')) where BookMeta_Subjects like '%Civil War%' or BookMeta_Subjects like '%Lincoln%' or BookMeta_Subjects like '%Slavery%' or BookMeta_Subjects like '%Confedera%' or BookMeta_Subjects like '%Antislavery%' or BookMeta_Subjects like '%Reconstruction%' ) where lat is not null and long is not null and abs(lat) < 80 and (abs(lat) > 0 or abs(long) > 0) group by lat,long ) where cnt > 4 and numbooks > 4 ORDER BY cnt DESC
The output of this can be saved as a CSV and imported directly into CartoDB to create the map below of the locations most frequently mentioned in books about the American Civil War, Abraham Lincoln, Slavery, and Reconstruction. Note that this map displays every single location worldwide mentioned anywhere in any of these books, so you will see a small selection of locations outside the United States and not associated with these subjects on the map. However, overall you will notice the map focuses extensively on the areas of the United States involved in these topics.
Imagine that – a single line of SQL and just 3.5 seconds later you have a CSV file that, with CartoDB and a few additional mouseclicks, gives you a map of the American Civil War through the eyes of 7,715 books published over the twenty years surrounding the war.
Now let's switch to the HathiTrust dataset and map all books published from 1900 to 1920 with the library-provided subject tag "World War", which refers to World War I:
select lat,long, cnt, numbooks from ( SELECT lat,long, COUNT(*) as cnt, count(distinct(BookMeta_Identifier)) as numbooks FROM ( select BookMeta_Identifier, ROUND(FLOAT(REGEXP_EXTRACT(SPLIT(V2Locations,';'),r'^[2-5]#.*?#.*?#.*?#.*?#(.*?)#.*?#')),3) as lat, ROUND(FLOAT(REGEXP_EXTRACT(SPLIT(V2Locations,';'),r'^[2-5]#.*?#.*?#.*?#.*?#.*?#(.*?)#')),3) AS long FROM (TABLE_QUERY([gdelt-bq:hathitrustbooks], 'REGEXP_EXTRACT(table_id, r"(\d{4})") BETWEEN "1900" AND "1920"')) where BookMeta_Subjects like '%World War%' ) where lat is not null and long is not null and abs(lat) < 80 and (abs(lat) > 0 or abs(long) > 0) group by lat,long ) where cnt >= 10 and numbooks >= 10 ORDER BY cnt DESC limit 13000
The 13,684 books with this subject tag generate a lot more hits than the Civil War dataset, so we increase our cutoff threshold and also limit ourselves to the first 13,000 results so that BigQuery will still allow us to download as a CSV file instead of having to export as a table and then export through GCS. The final map looks like this:
EMOTIONAL TIMELINES
For those more interested in tracing emotions over time, the query below shows how to graph the average intensity of a given emotion over time. If we look at the GCAM Codebook, we find that the ANEW Valence score for each book is stored as value "v19.1", which we can extract with the following query:
SELECT DATE, sum(integer(REGEXP_EXTRACT(GCAM, r'wc:(\d+)'))) wordcount,avg(float(REGEXP_EXTRACT(GCAM, r'v19.1:([-\d.]+)'))) emot FROM (TABLE_QUERY([gdelt-bq:internetarchivebooks], 'REGEXP_EXTRACT(table_id, r"(\d{4})") BETWEEN "1800" AND "2015"')) group by DATE
This yields the following timeline, where higher numbers represent more positive language used in books published that year, while lower numbers indicate greater negativity. Of course, the ANEW dictionary was designed for modern language use, so it may not accurately capture the emotional connotations of the English language of 200 years ago, but within those boundaries, the graph presents some intriguing results. Tone is relatively stable through the onset of the American Civil War in 1860, recovering by its end in 1866, then restabilizing through the turn of the new century, dropping sharply during the First and Second World Wars, and decreasing steadily through 1961, before rebounding sharply starting in the 1990's as the Archive's composition shifts to materials like university student newspapers, yearbooks, and other promotional materials.
FULL TEXT SEARCH
Finally, for those interested in examining the fulltext itself, the BookMeta_FullText field contains the fulltext of all Internet Archive books published from 1800 to 1922, inclusive. All carriage returns have been removed and hypenated words that were split across lines have been reconstructed.
NOTE that the complete fulltext of all Internet Archive books over these 122 years reaches nearly half a terabyte, so a single query across the entire fulltext collection will use up nearly half your monthly Google BigQuery free quote, so work with the fulltext field SPARINGLY.
Here is a simple example that shows how to construct a single-word ngram histogram for all Internet Archive books published in the year 1800. It consumes 550MB of your BigQuery quota and takes just 23 seconds to execute. It first converts the text to lowercase, then uses a simple naive regular expression to convert all non-letter characters to spaces, then splits on spaces into single words and finally generates a histogram of all words appearing more than 10 times total. Imagine that – a single line of SQL and 23 seconds later and you have a full-fledged single-word ngram histogram for books published in the year 1800!
select word, count FROM ( select word, count(*) as count FROM ( SELECT SPLIT(REGEXP_REPLACE(LOWER(BookMeta_FullText),'[^a-z]', ' '), ' ') as word FROM (TABLE_QUERY([gdelt-bq:internetarchivebooks], 'REGEXP_EXTRACT(table_id, r"(\d{4})") BETWEEN "1800" AND "1800"')) ) group by word ) where count > 10 order by count desc
The queries above represent just a minute sampling of what is possible with these two datasets and we are so enormously excited to see what you're able to do!
Neil Lennon attacked by fan as Celtic see off Hearts to keep title hopes alive
Celtic's manager, Neil Lennon, was attacked by a supporter from the main stand at Tynecastle in an incident that overshadowed the visitors' victory which takes the Scottish Premier League title race to the final day of the season.
Early in the second half a man ran towards Lennon and attempted to punch and grab him round the neck. The assailant made some contact with Lennon but was swiftly wrestled to the ground by coaches in the visiting technical area. Lennon responded by kicking at his assailant himself as police and stewards intervened.
Given ongoing security issues surrounding Lennon, his shaken look was of little surprise, but he was unhurt.
A section of the Celtic following subsequently became embroiled in fighting with the police and stewards. It was another grim chapter in an ugly Scottish campaign; fittingly, the match finished 10-a-side.
The chief executive of the Scottish Football Association, Stewart Regan, issued an immediate statement in condemnation of the Lennon affair. He said: "Clearly this kind of behaviour from supporters is wholly unacceptable. The safety of players, club officials and match officials is paramount on or around the field of play, and this clear breach of security is a matter I will be discussing with SPL chief executive Neil Doncaster tomorrow."
Fixtures between these two teams have taken on a fresh, toxic twist in recent times but not to the scale of tonight. Hearts' security arrangements will be the first thing under the scrutiny of both the SFA and the SPL as they pick through events tomorrow morning. There was little shock about the appearance of a Celtic security official alongside Lennon as he took to the pitch to acknowledge visiting supporters at full-time.
Rangers' victory over Dundee United 24 hours earlier had left Celtic with a perfectly straightforward task. Only an away win in Edinburgh would leave Celtic's oldest foes requiring the same result from Sunday's trip to Kilmarnock in order to secure the title.
Tuesday night's events at Ibrox also impacted on Hearts. United's defeat meant the Tynecastle team were confirmed as the SPL's third-placed team for this season, and will compete in the qualifying phase of the Europa League.
Such factors looked pertinent as Celtic opened by far the stronger. Gary Hooper endorsed that dominance after collecting a Kris Commons pass. Marius Zaliukas, the Hearts defender controversially left out for the weekend visit to Rangers, was culpable in handing the visitors possession.
Marian Kello fumbled a Commons shot onto a post as Celtic chased a second, Georgios Samaras somehow contriving to miss the rebound.
The hosts' task was made more arduous by the dismissal of David Obua, 13 minutes before the interval. The Ugandan offered little more than a hand-off to Charlie Mulgrew, with the assistant referee Keith Sorbie bizarrely instructing Craig Thomson to issue a red card. Hearts were unsure whether to be angry or bemused. Even Lennon looked sympathetic.
Hooper's second goal prompted ugly scenes. The striker collected a Ki Sung-Yeung pass before slotting home; which proved too much for one punter in the enclosure area of the main stand.
As he was huckled up the tunnel by police, trouble also broke out when the police moved into the Celtic end; the most vocal pro-IRA chanting of the night surrounded what bother occurred there.
Commons maintained what has been a prolific season with a cool finish at an angle, sealing Hearts' on-field fate at least. To round off an evening of madness, the former Derby County player promptly received a red card.
Commons, booked only moments earlier for diving, left the playing area and ran into the Celtic fans to celebrate, prompting a second yellow card.
The rumor mill has been all abuzz this morning with the news that Keanu Reeves himself stated that there are two more Matrix sequels in the works, while giving a speech at the London School for the Performing Arts University. However, Cole Abaius, from Film School Rejects reports that there is no such place. There is a London International School of Performing Arts, but a spokesperson confirmed to Screen Rant that no such appearance occurred, which hints strongly that there is little credibility to this rumor.
So, it seems like the internet has produced another bogus rumor…..at least for the time being. With all the sequels and remakes that are happening, I am sure that somewhere down the line Hollywood will spew this back out at us and Keanu Reeves will again grace us with the perpetual look of someone who just woke up from an afternoon nap.
As a side note, Keanu Reeves is already dusting off the ol' Kung Fu skills during a six month martial arts training regimen for an upcoming R-Rated Samurai film.
What are your thoughts about these rumors? Do you think Matrix 4/5 will happen?

Story highlights Tiffany Koehler: We all want to thrive and "make America great again"
Koehler's cancer care and treatment so far has cost more than $1 million
Hartford, Wisconsin (CNN) Tiffany Koehler was raised in foster care, is biracial, a veteran and a cancer survivor.
She also is a former candidate for the Wisconsin state legislature. She ran as a Republican and once was anti-Obamacare. Today she says she supports it -- mostly.
Her biggest objection remains the mandate that individuals must obtain health insurance coverage. "We all want to thrive," said Koehler, "and make America great again, as (President Donald Trump) says, but we can't do that if we're struggling to pay bills."
Tiffany Koehler today is more supportive of the Affordable Care Act.
"People have to be able to get to their doctors. People have to be able to get their medicine," said Koehler, "and out of any country in the world we should be doing it."
Two years ago, after losing her job, she did something she always had wanted to do; she ran for a seat in the Wisconsin State Assembly. She lost, and in the aftermath of that disappointment, got some awful news -- she had cancer. Koehler had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

If they had to do it all again, Linda Sirois and Angel Hebert might think twice before sharing their story with the world.
“We were kind of hoping it would be a local story and that's it,” Hebert said Monday. “It's kind of exploded.”
Additional Photos Madden Hebert rests with his mom, Angel Hebert, right, and his grandmother, Linda Sirois. Sirois carried the baby for her daughter, who has a heart condition. Family photo Related Headlines Grandma, baby, doing fine after nine-month ‘rental'
Added Sirois: “I don't wish for it to go any further.”
On Aug. 17, Sirois, 49, gave birth to a boy, Madden Brian Hebert. She carried the child for nine months in her uterus, but the egg and sperm belonged to her daughter and son-in-law. Hebert, 25, has a heart condition that could have complicated a pregnancy.
Since the story was first reported by media outlets in Maine, it has been picked up all over the world. Sirois, who lives in Madawaska, has fielded interview requests from ABC and NBC, and calls from Norway, Australia, Los Angeles and elsewhere.
“I don't have caller ID,” she said. “Maybe I should get it.”
So far, Sirois has turned down most of the requests. She's not interested in extending her 15 minutes of fame.
“People have done this before, right?” she said.
Surrogate pregnancy is growing in popularity. More than 1,000 babies are born each year to surrogate parents, said Sherri Smith, East Coast program administrator for the Center for Surrogate Parenting. But it's rare for a grandparent to be the surrogate.
“I would say that the intergenerational surrogacy incidence rate would be very small,” she said. “We see a lot more with sisters and friends. But it's also not surprising or shocking.”
The headlines – “Maine woman gives birth to her own grandson” (CBS News) and “The mother of all births keeps it in the family” (The Age) – were enough to make the story spread like chickenpox on a playground.
Hebert, a Presque Isle resident, said the fact that she and her mother live in northern Maine likely had something to do with the national reaction.
“They probably think we're in the boondocks up here,” she said with a laugh.
The story has generated emotional responses, positive and negative. Many readers commented online that they were inspired by Sirois' selfless act. Others were weirded out.
“It's great if people are inspired by this,” Hebert said. “But there is a lot of negative stuff. That's a little disappointing.”
Hebert said she and her husband, Brian, 29, never felt weird. Consider the alternative, she said: If the couple had asked or paid another woman to be a surrogate, things may not have worked out the same.
“We had better access; I felt more comfortable saying, ‘Eat this and eat that,'” Hebert said.
As for Sirois, people wondered during the pregnancy whether she would have a hard time giving up the child. But the child is still her grandson. She'll get to see him often.
She just wants to do it in private.
“I think everyone just wants to enjoy this little guy,” she said.
Hebert said she feels bad that her mother, such a private person, has been subjected to so much attention.
“She's been a celebrity here in Madawaska for months now,” she said. “But she deserves to be.”

A parliament that is too relaxed about officialdom listening in must not, once again, tune out of a conversation that needs to be had after Snowden
At his press conference today, the prime minister rattled off so many threats that listeners were, in effect, asked to pick their own rationale for his emergency data legislation. The myriad dangers – paedophile networks, organised crime, an unstable Middle East – have little in common, save for the fact that they are not passing exigencies at all, but chronic problems. The real emergency is not any sort of hidden plot; it is a ruling by the court of justice of the European Union which rejected virtually limitless state snooping on telephone and email data as disproportionate.
The EU directive thus struck down was a British concoction, pushed through in the post-7/7 mood, when an entirely understandable urge to give the authorities the anti-terror tools they required was intensified by New Labour's authoritarian posturing. It allowed governments to command communications companies to maintain for 12 months complete logs of who was ringing, emailing or texting whom when, and granted the authorities access to these revealing details of day-to-day personal life in sweeping circumstances. The interception commissioner's reports record that official requests for access to data are routine – with around half a million notices and authorisations a year. No wonder the Luxembourg court insisted that replacement rules would need many safeguards – covering checks on necessity, independent arbitration and more – to comply with human rights.
In its early days, the Cameron government called itself a coalition of liberty, and sounded sensitive to this point of view. Its founding agreement promised to "end storage of internet and email records without good reason". There were concessions today, on oversight, scope and procedure. But only time will tell how effective these will be. Whitehall's essential response is to rewrite a discredited European law on to the British statute book. There is unease about busybody officials and leaky databases, but such mundane anxieties do not hold attention in the same way that jihadi or paedophile plotters do. With this in mind, and no independent means of challenging the security state's demands, Labour and the Lib Dems have agreed to get behind David Cameron's bill, in return, chiefly, for welcome reviews of important parts of the system.
The pledged review of the 2000 Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act is badly overdue. Its specific remit to consider how to regulate domestic messages that travel "via international servers" responds to Edward Snowden's revelations about how national intelligence agencies exploit the web's global character to subvert promises about privacy at home. But neither a quickfire consensus forged by MPs about to jet off to the beach, nor anything else about today's announcement, suggested a parliament as committed as it should be to engaging with what it has brazenly neglected for months: the boundless appetite of NSA and GCHQ for personal data.
If Westminster was serious about the discussion which Barack Obama engaged in when he spoke about "the risks of government over-reach" in January, it could have begun its own post-Snowden reviews in parallel. That would have left it better placed to come up with a lawful framework for regulating surveillance in response to the Luxembourg ruling. It did not do so, preferring to stick its head into the sand – where it remained for three months after the EU judgment was given in April.
The expiry date for this legislation does not kick in for two-and-a-half years: there is a danger that the momentum for change could be lost. Precedent and the passage of time could substitute for argument, just as they are doing this week, as minsters insist that the only powers they are asking for cover things that they already do. Today's promised reviews will only fulfil their potential to effect change for the good if Labour and Lib Dem MPs especially impose some serious pressure. A British parliament that is far too relaxed about officialdom listening in must not, once again, tune out of a conversation that needs to be had.
Fez is Morocco's medieval city, dating back ages and crowned with such epithets as “The Athens of Africa” and “The Mecca of the West.” It is Morocco's second largest city, home to 1.1 million people, although you wouldn't know it by arriving at the Fes airport.
We got to Fes, and found it to be a single-plane, tarmac-debarking affair. For a city as large and popular as Fez, I was surprised. I blame the season. It was August, and it was excruciatingly hot.
We spent a week in Fes, staying at the Riad Doha in the old Medina. I never really learned how to spell it, so I alternate between Fes and Fez. There's also the red cap, which is a Fes. Or Fez.
The Fes Medina is for walking, and getting lost. I took the camera, and took these photos to share.

If these photos have given you some insight to Fez, maybe you're inspired to visit. In that case, you can read about how to get around Fes, Morocco. Otherwise, here are some other travel blog posts you might be interested in:
ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- Tim Tebow didn't win the Denver Broncos' starting quarterback job as much as Kyle Orton lost it.
Either way, Tebow has ditched his cap and clipboard and is now the starring attraction in Denver.
Coach John Fox made the switch official Tuesday, announcing Tebow will start against the Miami Dolphins when the Broncos return from their bye week.
He supplants Orton, who has struggled ever since winning the job with a spectacular training camp.
"Well, I think 1-4 has a lot to do with it," Fox said. "We haven't gotten it done as a football team. It's not one guy. It's not all Kyle Orton's fault. But we do have to make adjustments, we have to change and we have to do something to win football games."
Orton didn't carry over his sensational summer into the regular season, turning the ball over nine times and losing the organization's confidence and a string of winnable games as the Broncos stumbled to another bad start.
Fox had seen enough by halftime Sunday when he benched Orton and sent in Tebow. After a slow start, the former Florida star sparked a listless offense to within a last-gasp pass of coming back against San Diego.
As the Broncos trudged off the field, the stadium shook with a thunderous roar of "Tebow! Tebow! Tebow!"
Fox appreciates their passion but said the fans, who have been calling for Tebow ever louder by the week, had nothing to do with this move.
"It's not so much fan outcry as we're in a result-oriented business, and we're 1-4," Fox said. "It's not one guy. We'll see if this helps."
Tebow had his troubles -- rust, three fumbled snaps and six misfires in 10 pass attempts -- but he ran for a touchdown and threw for another while energizing the Broncos and fans frustrated by a franchise mired in mediocrity since its last winning season in 2005.
After thinking things over for a day and watching the game film, Fox decided to go all-in with Tebow.
It's time to see what he has in the popular and polarizing 24-year-old lefty, one of the most accomplished players in the history of college football but one whose skill set doesn't fit the mold of a prototypical pro passer.
I just heard moments ago the tragic news that Prince, one of the greatest recording and live artists of our time, passed away.
Over the years of writing about music, I've interviewed him, seen him perform big and small shows, and even run afoul of him.
The following obituary of sorts is from my last encounter with him, when the tables got turned. Instead of me interviewing Prince, somehow he started interviewing me. However, his questions were often more revealing about his character than answers would be in a normal interview.
The location was a Los Angeles club, where Prince sat with his entourage in a roped-off section, sporting a pencil-thin mustache, and a 80s puffy black shirt with vertical white vents. Suddenly, he started barraging me with questions, carefully evaluating each answer, as if he were giving me a test.
Because Prince doesn't allow reporters to record his voice, the following is paraphrased and reconstructed from notes made at the time.
Prince: So what else do you do?
Me: I also write books.
What are they about?
The last one was called The Game. I spent two years studying the techniques of the world's greatest pickup artists.
What were the others about?
I wrote books about people in entertainment. I did one with Motley Crue, another with Jenna Jameson, and some others about music.
So you write rock books?
I guess I mostly write about the dark side.
Why the dark side?
Because it's more interesting.
But the light side can be interesting too.
I suppose it can be. I never thought of that.
Do you believe in God?
I definitely believe in something greater than ourselves, but it depends on how you define God. (pause) Why did you ask that question?
Because it lets me know what someone is about. If you think about it, the light side can be just as interesting as the dark side.
Maybe I should write a book about that.
If you want to write a book about a mystery, I have one for you. Do you like mysteries?
I love mysteries. That's what storytelling is all about.
Have you ever studied the Bible?
I've read the Bible, but never studied it.
What do you mean by the Bible?
The old and new testaments.
Which version of the Bible did you read?
The King James.
The New World version is the most accurate version. It's also the best. It doesn't have the's and thou's. It's just ordinary language. Do you pray?
I don't pray. I've meditated though.
Why not?
I wasn't raised to.
Are your parents religious?
Yes, but they didn't really practice.
What did they do?
It was more important as a community to them.
Why is that important?
Perhaps as a sense of identity?
Isn't that racism?
I don't think it's about race. It does seem to be an unfortunate trait of human nature though to make divisions and pick sides, whether it's shirts versus skins or different sports teams.
Want to hear the mystery?
I'm ready.
The mystery is (long, dramatic pause): Why has the name God been slowly removed from the Bible?
What do you mean?
They have slowly taken the name God out of the Bible and replaced it with Lord. Do you know why?
Probably to give themselves more power?
It's about power, and people wanting to control others. Why do you think they want power?
I don't know. I think the problem with organized religion is that people who go to worship often need a conduit to God, or an authority telling them what's right and wrong. And that authority is sometimes abused.
But you need an authority, otherwise who are you responsible to?
You're responsible to yourself.
And the being who created the world and the trees and the oceans, you just ignore?Oh, I thought you meant a human authority. You can be responsible to God. Gratitude is very important.
(Prince begins talking in a hushed voice about the death of his father, and how it was hard for him. The club, unfortunately, is loud, and I'm not able to make out every word he says.)
Everyone has a rock bottom. We know what the rock bottom is. But what's the limit to happiness?
Has anyone reached the rock top? I wonder what that would be.
From here, the discussion turns to Jehovah's Witnesses, 9/11, violence in society, and a dozen other related subjects. At one point, he gestures to his band, the New Power Generation, and the rest of his entourage, and explains . . .
We like to talk like this. We can talk forever about what's wrong, but we like to think about solutions. Most people don't want to talk about politics and religion. They say, “Let's talk about something else.”
But what else is there? That's what our civilization is about.
That's right.
So let me ask you something: Do you think God is looking after each and every individual, or does he sometimes have to harm an individual in order to serve the greater good of the universe?
When everyone recognizes Jehovah's name, then everyone will be happy because everyone will know what to do and how to do it.
Really? That's it.
It's really that simple.

A123 will focus on manufacturing prismatic cells and systems at the new 291,000-square-foot Livonia facility. The factory is designed to enable the complete production process, including research and development, manufacturing of high-value components, cell fabrication, module fabrication and the final assembly of complete battery packs ready for vehicle integration. As part of its continuing U.S. manufacturing ramp up, A123 also plans to open a coating plant in Romulus, Mich., expected to come online during the first half of 2011. In addition to the DOE grant, the company received $125 million in state incentives from Michigan as part of its 21st Century Jobs Fund to help finance these manufacturing facilities.
A123 Systems, the makers of advanced lithium-ion batteries, have just opened a new battery factory in Livonia, Michigan. They claim that "based on available data" it is the largest battery plant in North-America (some manufacturer might be keeping their capacity secret). This new facility should increase A123's manufacturing capabilities by "up to 600MW hours per year when fully operational, contributing to the company's plan to expand global final cell assembly capacity to more than 760MW hours annually by the end of 2011. " That's a lot of batteries! And, as previously noted , it should help drive prices down.
A123 Systems has received a $249 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) last year, so if you are a U.S. taxpayer, this is your tax dollars at work. Better that than bridges to nowhere, no?

Danish Politician Convicted of ‘Racism' For Offending MuslimsLaw makes it illegal to insult someone's religionA Danish politician hasbeen convicted with “racism” and ordered to pay a fine for offendingMuslims under a law which makes insulting someone's religion a criminaloffense.Former European Parliament memberMogens Camre, who currently serves as a Danish People's Party councilorin Gladsaxe, was hit with a fine of 8,000 DKK (1186 USD), for a tweet inwhich he compared radical Islam to Nazism.“Muslims continue where Hitlerstopped. Only the same treatment that Hitler got will change thesituation,” Camre tweeted last July.After the tweet was reported, Camrewas charged under the Criminal Code racism clause 266 b paragraph 1,which makes it a crime to offend, “a group of people (who) werethreatened, insulted or degraded on account of race, color, national orethnic origin, religion or sexual orientation.” The law is based on a United Nations directive.Prosecutor Natalja Lindberg claimed that Camre was blaming Muslims for the Nazi genocide when he posted the tweet.“I have never before beencriticized for what I have written in my books, which are severalthousand pages. But now I have been criticized for my utterance withonly 140 characters,” Camre said in court.Camre's lawyer Peter Trudsø told TV 2,“I have a fundamental belief that we live in a society where freedom ofexpression is a very important factor. There must be a high ceiling inthe political debate, it is simply fundamental part of a democraticsociety, even if we express ourselves a bit over the line.”79-year-old Camre refused tocomment after the verdict but has indicated that he will appeal theconviction via the Danish High Court.The politician is a long termcritic of Islam, remarking previously that the religion cannot beallowed to dominate Europe because it is, “incompatible with ourvalues.”In the aftermath of the CharlieHebdo attacks, the world seemingly began to grasp the importance of freespeech – no matter how “offensive” – as the bedrock of a modern freesociety.That attitude appears toevaporating fast, with prominent critics of Islam in the United Kingdombeing snatched off the street for merely planning to attend a ‘drawMohammad' cartoon event www.infowars.com/uk-thought-police-arresting-people-who-may- , while Liberty GB leader Peter Weston was arrested by police for the “racially aggravated crime” of quoting Winston Churchill on the topic of Islam.Scandinavia is often held up as an example of what happens when political correctness runs riot.After the recent double murder of two Swedish citizens by Eritrean asylum seekers in an IKEA store, the Swedish government responded notby moving to protect their people from further terror attacks but byrushing to protect migrant communities from “dark forces in society.”Despite the fact that Sweden is currently experiencing a huge Muslim crime wave which includes a www.infowars.com/feminists-mute-on-muslim-rape-epidemic-swee thatis completely out of control, the lust to censor anyone who complainsabout it only seems to be on the increase. A similar attitude is alsotaking hold in Denmark and Norway.As we reported earlier this year,political correctness is so rampant in Sweden that some politicians areeven calling for returning ISIS jihadists to be given psychologicaltherapy and jobs – at taxpayer expense – to help them reintegrate intosociety.
The global group says the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte is 'delusional' for thinking it can sway other countries from pushing for accountability over drug-related killings
Published 2:10 PM, May 10, 2017
MANILA, Philippines – Human Rights Watch (HRW) on Wednesday, May 10, called Senator Alan Peter Cayetano's opening statement before United Nations (UN) member countries a "master-class in innovative defense of the indefensible."
Phelim Kine, the deputy director for Asia of the New York-based international organization, said the Philippine government is "delusional" if it thinks it can sway countries from condemning the extrajudicial killings linked to President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs.
"The Philippine government is delusional if it believes that cynical public exercises of fact-denial by official mouthpieces such as Cayetano can paper over the scale and savagery of Duterte's drug war," Kine said. "Instead, the global calls for accountability are likely to only grow louder."
Cayetano insisted during the dialogue under the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) at the UN headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on Monday, May 8, that there is no new wave of killings in the Philippines. He blamed critics and local media for "deceiving" the world.
Kine said Cayetano's defense is merely a "new tactic" of the Duterte administration.
"The Philippine government of President Rodrigo Duterte has a new tactic to deflect mounting foreign criticism of its murderous 'war on drugs' that has killed thousands: simply deny those deaths are anything out of the ordinary," he said.
Despite Cayetano's insistence, at least 45 countries expressed concern over the rise of extrajudicial killings under the Duterte administration.
They urged the Philippine government to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation to ensure those behind the killings are held accountable. (READ: Countries call for end to killings in PH drug war)
As of April 23 this year, 2,717 suspected drug personalities have been killed in legitimate police operations since the start of the Duterte administration, according to data from the Philippine National Police (PNP). There are 3,603 deaths under investigation. (READ: IN NUMBERS: Philippines' 'war on drugs')

Britain's Labour Party's conference has played host to the foreign-funded Hope Not Hate group, which has said Labour must start talking to “racist” working class people if the party wants to defeat the UK Independence Party.
Speaking at an event at Labour's conference in Liverpool on Monday, John Page from the notorious Hope Not Hate group, said that supporters of mass migration are “smarter than” working class voters who have turned away from the party to support the UK Independence Party (UKIP). He insisted that the only way Labour can reclaim such voters is for activists to go out and speak with them in order to change their opinions.
Just under four million people voted for UKIP in last May's general election, resulting in the party coming second in 120 constituencies. A large number of these were areas long considered to be in “safe” Labour seats, and UKIP's new leader Diane James has expressed an interest in UKIP targeting Labour seats in the north of England.
The party decimated Labour's majority in the Heywood and Middleton seat in the 2014 by-election, slashing it from 6,000 votes to just 600, and marking its position as Labour's main opposition in the north of England.
In his speech Page said: “If we want to win in these communities and I'm thinking about places like Rotherham, like Dudley, like Merthyr Tydfil, like Thurrock, we need to start off with a discussion with people who hold racist views.
“It's no good saying to ourselves we are going to go out and find the people who are anti-racist and we are going to have a little meeting or a little rally or put up a banner saying ‘refugees welcome here' because in some of these communities refugees are not welcome, in fact, refugees are held to be the problem.”
He added: “We cannot deal with the racism that is growing in some of these communities by myth-busting by being smarter than people, but trumping them with facts, we have to do something very different.
“We have to distinguish between the hard racists who are actually off-the-spectrum, and those people who are not inherently racist but have adopted racist views and narratives, what I would refer to as ‘I'm not racist but…' Those are the people that we need to engage with.”
Hope Not Hate chief Nick Lowles also addressed the meeting, asserting that Labour MPs are wrong to agree with ending freedom of movement within the European Union (EU).
A number of the party's MPs including high-profile Remain campaigner Chuka Umunna have said the ‘Brexit' deal should end freedom of movement. He told the room: “I think that's morally, politically and tactically wrong.”
Funded by notorious, open borders-supporting, hedge fund managing billionaire George Soros, Hope Not Hate released a controversial report last year that smeared Muslims who campaign against Islamic extremism.
Moderate Muslims in turn slammed the document, which purportedly “exposes” groups and individuals who are “anti-Muslim”, as “hate-filled” and “totally discredited”. Readers were shocked to see devout Muslims who campaign against hardline, intolerant aspects of their religion fingered by authors Lowles and Joe Mulhall as “Islamophobic”.
Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has said Hamburg's decision to demote on-loan United States international Julian Green to their reserve side is "regrettable."
Green moved to Hamburg on a season-long loan in the summer but has been unable to force his way into the Bundesliga strugglers' first team, making just one start under previous boss Mirko Slomka and four substitute appearances under his successor, Joe Zinnbauer, while failing to make the match-day squad on several occasions.
Earlier this week, Hamburg sporting director Peter Knabel announced that Green had been demoted to the club's fourth-tier reserve team, leading the 19-year-old, who featured for the United States at the 2014 World Cup, to respond on Facebook: "Nobody from HSV has spoken to me at all. I read in the papers that apparently I'm now playing for the U23.
"HSV took me on on the third day of the season to reinforce the first team. This was and is my aim, and is the reason why I transferred.
"I'm a licensed player, I haven't done anything wrong and I give all I've got in the training sessions. I always want to do my best to keep us in the league. If they let me play, I'll shoot goals."
Rummenigge said Bavaria were also unimpressed with the situation.
"That's not what our intention was -- we send players on loan so that they can play at the highest level, and develop," he told Bild. "This not the case now. We can't and we don't want to 'stick our oar in' when it comes to the HSV coach's lineup. Nevertheless, the development is regrettable."
Speaking to his news conference ahead of Hamburg's trip to Bayern at the weekend, though, HSV coach Zinnbauer said it was "still not decided" whether he would be part of the first-team squad.
He added: "There were a few positive signs -- he is a bit angry and I want to see that. I hope he does not forget what he has to do to make the squad."
If you're looking for a nice two-story, walk-up* withspectacular views from the Moon, Mars or any potential deep space destination,look no further than the NASA Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU) and their newlyadded second level!
Of course, the HDU, the new second level and a soon to beadded Hygiene Module together form the Deep Space Habitat configuration of theHDU that will be featured in this year's D-RATS analog field test.
But, I am getting ahead of myself. The essential 2nd level has not been completelydecided on yet.
There are currently three different options being consideredthrough a fascinating competition know as the X-Hab Academic InnovationChallenge. Three Universities wereselected from a number of entries to design, build and demonstrate their inflatablehabitat concepts all the way from CAD drawings to a full scale demonstrationunit.
Each school has one week to deploy their version of theinterstellar penthouse on top of NASA's current HDU at NASA Johnson SpaceCenter. The final demonstration units will be judged on manydifferent criteria, such as ratio between the packed hab's volume and thedeployed hab's volume, deployment time, the lowest hourly pressure decay andself-support due to loss of internal pressure. Coincidentally, these align perfectly with my every dayliving requirements!
The three schools are Oklahoma State University (June 6th– 10th,) the University of Maryland (June 13th – 17th)and the University of Wisconsin (June 20th – 24th.) The pictures below were taken duringour trip to NASA Johnson while the University of Maryland was testing andinstalling their demo unit.

All of the teams have overcome many different obstacles andengineering challenges to deliver their inflatable habs, but the learningexperience from the process itself is invaluable. As one student commented when asked about seeing theirteam's demonstration being deployed, “I'm curious. I'm excited, but we all really want to see if our ideas workwell.”
For the winners? Their demonstration will experience full field implementation duringNASA's analog field test in Arizone (D-RATS 2011.) The winning design will be announced sometime during theweek of June 27th – July 1st, 2011.
For the record, I volunteer to stay in the winner'sdemonstration unit as long as they agree to fully return my security depositwhen the analog is finished. Plus,I SPLIT the utilities with my fellow medianauts from NASA EDGE. Too many times, I've been left with thetab.

A person who is physically active at a wet-bulb temperature of 80 degrees will have trouble maintaining a constant core temperature and risks overheating. A sedentary person who is naked and in the shade will run into the same problem at a wet-bulb temperature of 92 degrees. A wet-bulb temperature of 95 degrees is lethal after about six hours.
In the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, the highest wet-bulb temperatures of the latest heat wave have peaked around 86 degrees — levels approaching the worst of the 1995 Midwest heat wave, which set records in the United States for humid heat.
Heat waves are the natural disasters easiest to tie to climate change. Statistical analyses and climate modeling indicate that the 2010 Russian heat wave was about five times more likely to have occurred in 2010 than it would have been in the cooler 1960s. An analysis conducted after the 2003 European heat wave concluded that it was twice as likely as it would have been before the Industrial Revolution. A recent study in the journal Nature Climate Change found that the 1.5 degrees of global warming since the start of the Industrial Revolution had quadrupled the probability of moderate heat extremes.
In work one of us (Robert Kopp) led for the Risky Business Project, we found that over the period from 1981 to 2010, the average American experienced about four dangerously humid days, with wet-bulb temperatures exceeding 80 degrees. By 2030, that level is expected to more than double, to about 10 days per summer. Manhattanites are expected to experience nearly seven uncomfortably muggy weeks in a typical summer, with wet-bulb temperatures exceeding 74 degrees, about as many as residents of Washington have experienced recently.
That increase over the next couple of decades is locked in by the greenhouse gases we've already emitted and by our current energy system. Since we can't avoid it now, we must make our communities more resilient to heat and humidity extremes. One step is to expand access to air-conditioning for those who can't afford it. We must also improve cooling in stiflingly hot factories and warehouses, strengthen public health systems, improve public warnings when heat and humidity are dangerously high, and be willing to shift outdoor work schedules.
Of course, air-conditioning poses its own problems. Air-conditioners use a lot of electricity, and generating it with our current power system along with the leakage of coolants from these machines will add to the heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere.
Still, as a society, we can influence the weather of the future by the decisions we make today. If we choose not to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases and instead continue to rely upon fossil fuels, the average American could expect to see about 17 dangerously humid days in a typical summer in 2050 and about 35 in 2090.
UPDATE: Metro has created a survey about the changes described here. Please take it once you feel comfortable with the concepts; our stories next week may help. Metro's Jeff Switzer says: “The 200+ comments are great, and we're reading them, but it would help to capture them for tracking and analysis via the survey.”
Yesterday evening, Metro and Sound Transit made public for the first time their proposals for restructuring bus service around Sound Transit's University Link light-rail extension. The fully tunneled extension will add two new Link stations: Capitol Hill Station near Broadway and John, and University of Washington Station next to Husky Stadium. The trip between UW Station and Westlake Station should take just 6-8 minutes. As of now, U-Link is scheduled to open to the public in March 2016. A Metro and Sound Transit service change, when the agencies will restructure bus service, will happen at the same time. (UPDATE: Sound Transit's Bruce Gray emails to say: “[This post] says U Link opens in March. Right now we're still just saying First Quarter.” This leaves open the possibility that U-Link could open before to restructure takes effect.)
Metro is taking the lead on developing the restructures, because the vast majority of the impact is to Metro's network. In a package of information released late yesterday, Metro is offering two alternatives for public comment. “Alternative 1” represents a major rethinking of bus service in several areas affected by U-Link, while “Alternative 2” seeks to keep change to a minimum. Metro designed both alternatives to be revenue-neutral; neither alternative spends an extra dollar compared to today's bus network. Metro has created route maps of both alternatives, which include midday, peak, and Eastside route networks, as well as frequency maps.
One thing that is absolutely critical to understanding this proposal: Metro did not take extra funding the City of Seattle is providing because of Proposition 1 into account in designing either alternative. Prop 1 only provides 6 years of taxing authority, and Metro wants to build a network it can sustain indefinitely. So everything you will read below, in upcoming posts, and in Metro's materials is purely funded by Metro, without Prop 1. Seattle's Prop 1 funds would add to these proposals. The city has not yet decided exactly what to add, but its additions will likely resemble SDOT's choices to improve the current network. Bill Bryant of SDOT's Transit Division told STB's Zach Shaner by email that the city would need to develop specifics by late summer or early fall.
Broadly speaking, the restructures cover four areas: Northeast Seattle, Capitol Hill, SR-520 bridge service, and to a lesser extent, Downtown Seattle and South Lake Union. In the coming days, we will have four posts that will go into down-in-the-weeds detail about what Alternative 1 would mean for each of these areas. For now, we'll look at the big picture.
Alternative 1 is an aggressive investment in higher frequency, route consolidation, and network legibility, of exactly the sort we've long advocated. It continues Metro's commendable recent history – first with their ambitious initial proposal for the 2012 west-side restructure, and then with their proposed 2014 cuts – of putting real network improvements on the table.
View the frequency comparison map.
Alternative 1 doesn't just tinker around the margins; it creates new, frequent, all-day connections in a large portion of the city. Oran's before-and-after maps above (slide the white bar left and right) show Alternative 1's headline feature: major frequency improvements on nearly every all-day route that connects to a U-Link station. We'll go into route-by-route depth in our upcoming posts, but in this introduction we'll think about corridors rather than routes. Here are some highlights:
Northeast Seattle A true grid of 15-minute routes comes to all of Northeast Seattle, a quadrant of the city that currently has almost no frequent service. NE 65th St, 25th Ave NE, 35th Ave NE, and Sand Point Way would all gain new 15-minute service. Children's Hospital and University Village would have frequent service to both the central UW campus and UW Station. The Roosevelt Way and 15th Ave NE corridors are consolidated to provide 10-minute all-day service between Northgate, Roosevelt, the U-District, and UW Station. Many urban neighborhoods get new frequent connections, including a new frequent line that connects Fremont, Wallingford, Green Lake, Roosevelt, Ravenna, and Sand Point. Alternative 1 creates an all-day frequent connection between Crown Hill, Greenwood, Green Lake, Roosevelt, the U-District, and Bellevue.
Capitol Hill Alternative 1 creates 4 hubs that each allow 10 minute transfers where none exist today: 23rd/Cherry , 23rd/Thomas, Broadway/John, and Broadway/Jefferson (with a little help from the streetcar). There is a new 10-minute bus connection between North Capitol Hill, Capitol Hill Station, and the First Hill hospitals. Crosstown service between Uptown, SLU, Capitol Hill, and Madison Valley gets 10-minute frequency and is extended to Madison Park. There is a new 15-minute connection between the C.D., Madison Valley, Pike/Pine, and Upper Broadway. Live on Broadway but like to shop at Trader Joe's? There would be a bus for that.
SR-520 and Peak Service Ends all off-peak service into Downtown Seattle from SR 520, while asking many riders to transfer to Link at UW Station even during peak hours. Reorganizes peak-hour SR-520 service to create frequent routes serving many more destinations on both ends of SR-520. Creates a new, frequent peak-hour connection between the SR-520 corridor, the U-District, SLU, and Uptown. Creates a new, frequent all-day connection between the SR-520 corridor, Roosevelt, Green Lake, Greenwood, and Crown Hill. Creates a new peak-hour connection between the U-District, South Lake Union, and First Hill.
Given its ambitious scope, it's no surprise that Alternative 1 implies some significant tradeoffs as well, and we will talk more about those in our next few posts. Generally speaking, these new connections and higher frequencies are purchased by consolidating all-day routes for the sake of frequency and by asking Link to carry a heavy peak load at UW Station.
By contrast, Alternative 2 is a true minimum-change scenario. It has no significant frequency improvements, a couple of minor frequency cuts, and only a few small route changes. It is not a less aggressive restructure than Alternative 1; rather, it's not a restructured at all. While Metro will (as it should) put on its best poker face and treat these alternatives as equals, Alternative 2 simply doesn't display the level of innovation and creative thinking that Alternative 1 does.
Alternative 2 makes just one major change from current service, which actually has little to do with U-Link. It consolidates current routes 66, 67, 72, and 73 into a single all-day route running between Northgate and downtown via the University District (the route we have called the “80X” in the past), and turns route 71 into an infrequent east-west shuttle route. Other changes can almost literally be listed on one hand, and include consolidation of route 30 and route 68 into a single milk run; a split of poorly used route 25 to allow infrequent connections between Laurelhurst and UW Station; reduction in frequency on an otherwise-unchanged 43; and straightening of route 16 in the Northgate area. This alternative is so simple relative to Alternative 1, and so similar to the status quo, that we feel no need to cover it in heavy detail.
Whichever alternative is adopted, Metro gets another bite at part of this apple in five years. North Link will open in 2021, with new stations at the U-District, Roosevelt, and Northgate. As we'll discuss in the Northeast Seattle post, Alternative 1 is already anticipating North Link. Nevertheless, it's certain that further restructures will be needed in 2021, and this gives Metro a valuable opportunity to correct any changes in next year's restructure that do not work as well as expected.
We'll cover the following parts of to restructure in more detail throughout next week, and will add links here as the posts go live.
Monday: Northeast Seattle
Tuesday: Capitol Hill
Wednesday: SR 520 Cross-Lake Service
Thursday: Downtown and South Lake Union
Alternative 1 is the most exciting development in Seattle transit in many years. While we've had a few internal debates about details, the STB staff is unanimously happy with the overall direction Metro planners have taken, and we hope Metro ends up implementing something more or less like Alternative 1 next March.
Codi Wilson, CP24.com
City staff are recommending that the flat fee to hop into a cab in Toronto be reduced from $4.25 to $3.25 to allow traditional taxi companies to compete with ride-hailing app Uber.
The recommendation was made in a municipal licensing and standards report released Wednesday morning.
Speaking to reporters Wednesday afternoon, Mayor John Tory said he supports lowering the standard fare by a dollar.
“Not only does this make getting around the city more affordable for the public, but it also makes a traditional taxicab more competitive with Uber, especially given that taxis will continue to be the only vehicles which can be hailed on the street," Tory said.
Back in July, city councillors voted in favour of reviewing the rules governing the ground transportation industry in Toronto in an effort to create a level playing field between traditional taxis and Uber.
Taxi companies say UberX drivers put passenger safety at risk and are at a competitive advantage because they are not held to the same regulations and restrictions as the rest of the industry.
To address this issue, city staff have also recommended that Uber be placed in a new licensing category referred to as the Transportation Network Companies, which would require drivers to have commercial liability insurance, pay annual permit fees and consent to background checks.
"The staff report released today puts us on the right path forward," Tory said.
"Today, we've taken the first step forward to first bring Uber inside the law and regulate it and secondly, we've taken a very definitive step … to actually make it easier for taxis to compete for business."
While Tory acknowledged that Uber has been a "disruptive technology" for cab companies in the city, he said he does not believe it is the city's job to "legislate Uber out of existence."
"What we are embarking on here should not be viewed at all or presented … as a struggle between the cab industry and Uber because that is not what this is about. This is about giving the travelling public what they already have and what they want to continue to have going forward— competitive prices, convenience and better customer service," he said.
"Uber and technologies like it are here to stay. They are here to stay not because of anything I say or think, but because the people of Toronto continue to embrace the sharing economy at an unprecedented rate."
In a statement issued Wednesday, Uber reiterated its desire to work with the city to implement ridesharing regulations.
"It's great to see the thoughtful leadership City staff have shown in crafting this report, which has a thorough understanding of how ridesharing, consumer choice and smart regulations can benefit Torontonians," the statement said.
"Having facilitated more than 4 million ridesharing trips in Toronto in the last year, Uber has become a choice local riders and drivers depend on. Given this scale, we recognize the need to be regulated and Uber is fully committed to work in partnership with the City in helping adopt and implement ridesharing regulations."
The president of iTaxi Workers Sajid Mughal, however, was not so optimistic about the two-tiered regulation system proposed in the report.
"If adopted by Council, these recommendations will spell the end of Toronto's taxi industry as we know it," Mughal said in a written statement issued shortly after the report was released.
"Taxicabs are regulated for a reason: they carry our most valuable cargo, human beings. We cannot have the wild, wild west in the area of transporting vulnerable passengers."
Coun. Jim Karygiannis, a strong Uber opponent who tabled the motion to review ground transportation services in the city, also slammed the report's recommendations.
"(Uber) should be licensed as a brokerage or they can leave town," Karygiannis said.
"The issue is that the spirit of the motion that I put through, and it was seconded by the mayor, was to have everyone on a level playing field. What we have here are two levels, one for the taxi industry… and one for Uber, which are you can do whatever you want."
Beck Taxi said it intends to "carefully consider the report" but added they were pleased to see at least one of the recommendations on the list.
“We're encouraged the city is taking the issue of insurance seriously,” Kristine Hubbard, Operations Manager at Beck, said in a written statement.
“That said, we want to make sure City Hall takes seriously its responsibility to protect Toronto's riders.”
This report will be discussed by the Licensing and Standards Committee on September 16.
This topic has been written on many times before but it is an important principle that is forgotten extremely easily (and often ignored entirely). It is somewhat of a pet peeve of mine when players believe they are taking the game seriously but delude themselves somehow into believing that piloting a known quantity is somehow an egregious error.
Another fair warning: If you don't like abrasively toned articles then you can go straight to the forums to complain now. For the freaks out there who have been telling me that I've gone soft and need to lay down the law again please enjoy.
Playing the best deck or at least playing an established archetype is nearly always the correct decision if your ultimate goal is to do well in the tournament. If your goal is to play the best version of your favorite archetype or to play something no one else is playing or anything besides purely "place as highly as possible in the tournament" then this article is not for you.
The people who already play the best deck likely know nearly everything that I am going to be talking about today. This is for those who scoff at "netdeckers" and people who try and brew a new deck for every single tournament week after week. Again only if you are trying to win. If you merely want to build decks to build decks then please continue doing what makes you happy but please recognize that some players have different priorities namely winning. That doesn't somehow make you "better" or some form of Magic Purist. There is plenty of room for a multitude of approaches to this magnificent game and judging one another for our different paths that lead us to it is a corrosive and pointless activity.
I've been considering writing this article for a while now but it was only recently that I was inspired to actually put pen to paper (or finger to key as it were). This is because of my recent interactions with the very awesome Lewis Laskin and Nick Spagnolo. Lewis likes to brew a little too much for his own good and Nick often plays whatever he comes up with. However this is basically the worst decision possible for little Nicky. You see even if the deck that Laskin comes up with is awesome Nick is still at a huge disadvantage when playing it because he will have gotten it very recently and wouldn't have had time to properly test it and learn how to play it. Lewis knows how his deck is going to work and how to play it because he was the one who built it and in building a deck you instill it with certain qualities attributes and abilities. There is inherent knowledge inside of a deck of Magic cards and don't try and tell me that there isn't.
I call it the Conley Conundrum; a player who is playing an off-the-wall brew but isn't the one who built it is not likely to do well. Nobody who has played a Conley deck besides Conley has ever really done well with it at its debut tournament. That's not a coincidence and he has been giving his lists to some players who are quite good at slinging spells.
So why does this happen? Well I've already explained that to you; decks have inherent knowledge. A decklist is not only a snapshot in time but an artistic expression. A painter knows what he wants to paint and paints it and then knows what it is that he painted. Another person looking at that painting may have many potential guesses as to what was depicted abstractly in the piece. Magic decks work the same way.
I feel bad for Nick and Lewis to a degree* because they are just better than nearly everyone else at these StarCityGames.com Opens but handicap themselves so often that neither of them put up very impressive numbers these days. Nick put up a Top 8 in Dallas and guess what? He was playing a fairly stock Caw-Blade list. That is all it takes. If you play better than your opponents you don't need fancy gadgets and high-variance medium-impact cards or strategies to compete. You just need a deck that can reasonably win and your brain.
*Less so because I suspect that Mr. Laskin would rather build a sweet deck than win with a known quantity. Although to his credit he did play Caw-Blade at the GP so he may be turning over a new leaf.
And I don't mean to pick on Nick and Lewis as the number of people who do this sort of thing is preposterous. I'm looking at you Adam Boyd. Look at the people who have been doing better in these events than anyone else: Gerry Thompson Alex Bertoncini Edgar Flores and myself. And we all play nearly the same deck nearly every week in both formats.
It has been said before multiple times and people still refuse to listen: it is far more important to do something powerful and know your deck inside and out than it is to have some slight technological edge which isn't even there most of the time.
Patrick Chapin and I—and pretty much every top-notch deck designer I have heard comment on it including Conley and Gerry—have always said that the hit-to-miss ratio for "brews" is much worse than amateur deck designers realize. It has to be by nature as if the good decks were obvious then they wouldn't still be undiscovered. I think that saying nine out of ten rogue designs are bad is extremely generous and I would put that number more realistically around nineteen of twenty. But let's say that it is nine out of ten. That means that if you brew a new deck every single tournament it will take you ten tournaments to come up with one deck that is remotely passable. Then it will be untuned and you haven't practiced with it that much meaning you probably still aren't going to win the tournament. And by the time you tune and practice with the deck it will have become a known quantity and a lot of your edge is lost.
That is a pretty depressing realization but a necessary one to make.
Not to mention that very few people understand the game at a deep enough level to build decks properly in the first place so that ratio may be even worse. And do you know how you get to know a metagame inside and out and learn how the best decks function? By playing the best decks.
Back in my days of (more) arrogant (more) youth I had essentially learned competitive Magic by playing Threshold in Legacy right before and right after the printing of . I used to say something along the lines of "Give me s and Forces and I'll beat anyone with anything." And it was fairly true. The cards in the deck were so powerful and cohesive and I knew the deck so intimately and the metagame so well that I had an unbelievable win rate in the local Legacy tournaments with the stockest of stock Threshold lists.
I tried some brews every once in a while such as the combo deck and Landstill with Scepters but couldn't beat a goldfish if I tried my hardest. The lists were bad; I played poorly and just got crushed over and over. I had moved away from what had made me successful and was dearly punished. I had lost sight of the fact that as long as your deck has the capability to win tightness of play and familiarity with your deck are far more important than the actual cards used.
Plus building decks takes a lot of energy energy that you are much better off allocating towards working on your technical game.
They don't give you extra prize when you Top 8 with a rogue deck; you get the same thing as the guy playing the stock deck next to you. If all you want is the pride of doing decently with a deck of your own design then you have to acknowledge that fact as you are giving up nearly all right to complain when you lose to more powerful strategies (or strategies that the more powerful strategies would have beaten). Would you rather get second in a tournament with a stock list or tenth in a tournament with a rogue one? That is something you have to ask yourself when choosing what to play in an upcoming event.
Even if you are the first to play a deck that has an unbelievable technological edge over the field (which we've established is very unlikely and it will still be untuned and you'll be ill-practiced) you could still just run bad at a tournament and never know that you had broken it. Or you could do semi-well and then the deck is known and there was no point in doing all of that pioneering in the first place since everyone plugged in to the hive mind catches up immediately. So why are you trying so hard to be the first to do something when it is so extremely unprofitable?
Pioneers get arrows. Settlers get land.
Finding a deck with sound theory behind it to improve and tune and practice with is a much easier and more effective way to create decks than starting with a card and building around it or any other of the many approaches to deck design. Gerry Thompson one of the best deck designers of our era has made his career on doing exactly that. The idea that an innovative design has to be something crazy and off the wall with cards that nobody has ever seen played in Constructed is a fallacy. The greatest decks that he has designed have been slight tweaks to existing archetypes that give them a far more powerful endgame new dynamics and/or higher resiliency.
Those decisions are innovative and he puts up consistently impressive performances week in and week out. Finding the right countersuit or adding/cutting a color from a deck perhaps fixing a mana base and adding more of a certain type of card are all realistic and effective means to "create" a deck. You don't have to build around an underplayed card or add to your deck in order to be on the cutting edge. In fact those things will almost always leave you behind the curve.
Sometimes the best deck in a format is hated out enough to not be worth playing but it is rare that the metagame gets hostile enough if the deck is as good as the best decks we've had in recent history. A deck like the Naya Shaman list that I made with Ryan O'Connor that he Top 4ed Dallas with could never be "the best deck" because if it ever became such everyone would just start playing Valukut and it would be vanquished. However Caw-Blade and its tricolored variants are so powerful and versatile that they really don't have any horrible matchups. A couple is slightly unfavorable but a lot are auto-wins or mirror matches where skill determines the winner.
If you aren't playing and Jace the Mind Sculptor in Standard then you had better have a very good reason. Either card availability issues (which can be solved with a credit card at this very website) or priorities other than winning at any cost.
People insist on bringing knives to gun fights. And those always seem to be the people complaining about luck as well. In my experience this is not a coincidence. Just like how the person who works the hardest appears to get the luckiest the people who put themselves in poor positions before the tournaments even begin often seem to have been born under a bad sign.
Now I've played some capital-B Bad decks in my day but look at some of my best Constructed finishes:
2nd PTQ - Faeries in Lorwyn Block
5th Grand Prix Denver - Faeries in Lorwyn Block
19th PT Berlin - Zoo in Extended
8-2 PT Kyoto - tweaked 5cc in Standard
5-1 PT Rome - Boros Bushwhacker in Standard
5-1 PT Rome - Zoo in Extended
A handful of decent performances at SCG Opens - Caw-Blade in Standard
Notice anything? Whenever I played one of the best decks in the format and knew it well which I did for all of these finishes I did reasonably well. However I brewed quite a bit in between those tournaments and put up mediocre (at best) finishes with all but one of them (excluding Legacy) when I scooped the finals of an Extended PTQ playing a rogue U/W Thopter Control build. I then promptly 1-3ed the subsequent GP with the same deck in the same format after my three byes. The PTQ had just been soft.
I ended up talking a whole lot about myself in this article which will probably be taken as arrogance. I was merely giving examples from my own experiences in order to illustrate my points and sadly my own experiences are the only ones I'm intimately familiar with.
I suggest trying to release your stigmas surrounding playing "the best deck." I know one of the biggest reasons people dislike doing so is because they want to avoid mirror matches. However oftentimes the mirror match of the best deck is extremely skill intensive. I wouldn't want to play the Valakut mirror ever again but the Caw-Blade mirror much like the Faeries mirrors of yore almost always goes to the player with more experience. All you have to do is put in the effort.
The only ones who think that it isn't a skill intensive matchup are the people who lose it not even realizing that the loss was 100% on them. Don't be that guy; try and think through every single factor of each play and always reflect upon the decisions you make. That is how you grow. That is how you win.

The Marvel Cinematic Universe is about to get strange. The franchise will see Doctor Strange hit theaters later this November, but first, Agents of SHIELD is set to shake up things on the small screen. The series will return to ABC this month for Season 4 and introduce a major Marvel character to the to fans. According to Clark Gregg (Phil Coulson), viewers can expect Ghost Rider to introduce strange elements to the MCU before Stephen Strange gets the chance.
Speaking with Entertainment Weekly, the actor revealed how Ghost Rider will alter the Agents of SHIELD and the entire MCU. “He's a different kind of threat than anything we've faced before,” he explained.
“It introduces a part of the Marvel world that deals more with strange elements of the Marvel Universe and he's definitely the villain from hell.”
Of course, members of Team Coulson are used to weird happenstances at this point. From extraterrestrial aliens to secret Nazi organizations, the show has seen it all - that is, except for the supernatural. Ghost Rider will be ushering in a new era of occult mystery to the series.
If you're not familiar with Ghost Rider, then you should know the hero is one who gains their powers from otherworldly beings. Johnny Blaze, the most famous iteration of Ghost Rider, was bound to a demon and used its powers to become the ‘Spirit of Vengeance.' However, Agents of SHIELD will have a somewhat altered Ghost Rider. The show will feature Robbie Reyes, the newest character to take up the ghostly moniker. The teenager is possessed by the ghost of a satanic serial killer named Eli Morrow in the comics. Marvel TV has confirmed they will be putting their own spin on the character, but many fans wonder if the hero's darker origins might feed into the grittier tone of Agents of SHIELD.
In a recent interview, executive producer Jeff Bell said that having Ghost Rider on the show “opens up a whole different kind of storytelling for us.” Actress Chloe Bennet (Daisy ‘Quake' Johnson) also commented on the character and said anyone familiar with Robbie Reyes would see why Agents of SHIELD must go to dark places to explore his backstory. “These massive themes [are] being threaded throughout our season,” she explained. As for how Ghost Rider will change, fans aren't sure. Jed Whedon, an executive producer for Agents of SHIELD, simply told TVLine, “We are doing our own spin on it. We don't want people who have read the comics to know exactly what's coming.”
One week after President Donald Trump issued an executive order that temporarily banned most immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries, several cultural organizations at Ohio State have come together to sponsor a “blackout” on Friday as a form of protest.
Ten student organizations, including the Somali Students' Association, the Arab Student Union and the African Youth League, have combined forces to mobilize students across campus. They are asking the OSU community to wear all black all day on Friday to stand up against the new policies.
“The objective of this blackout is to create unity and solidarity amongst our campus community in light of actions that are going on around us,” said Suad Osman, president of the Somali Students' Association and a third-year in neuroscience, in an email. “We wanted to create an act that would not entice feelings of animosity, but one that would show a simple act of solidarity that anyone is able to partake in. It takes very little effort to put on a black shirt, but the meaning will have no bounds.”
Somalia is one of the countries affected by the ban, which has barred most citizens of the seven countries from traveling to the U.S. for 90 days, indefinitely banned the entry of Syrian refugees into the U.S. and suspended the U.S. refugee-intake program as a whole for 120 days.
Grace Azenabor, head of public relations for the African Youth League and a third-year in marketing and economics, said even before the election, Islamophobia and the meaning of democracy were a main discussion point among minorities.
After the immigration order was announced on Friday, a weekend of protests followed, both in Columbus and around the country. Azenabor said that different African, Arab and Muslim student organizations on campus wanted to work together to plan the campus-wide blackout.
“We stand for something stronger than hate and that we stand for what this is supposed to be about. This is supposed to be about freedom, acceptance and equality,” she said. “We felt that because of this administration, that wouldn't be exhibited or practiced at all … by showing our community through this blackout we'll be able to show to campus, and to a greater community as well, that this ban is not something that we're for, that this regime is not something that we're for, and that we aren't going to stay quiet and let this happen without any resistance.”
Leen Amin, president of the Arab Student Union and a fourth-year in international studies and world politics, said these types of events are important to help advocate for those who have been affected by the ban, and also to educate students who are unaware of these issues and their effects on the community.
At least 94 OSU students and visiting scholars are affected by the ban, according to OSU.
“We hope that it'll maybe teach them that people coming from these countries are just innocent human beings who are fleeing war and terror and just want a better life in the United States,” Amin said. “That's what this country was founded on, it was founded by immigrants for immigrants as a safe haven from persecution, and so hopefully it'll raise awareness and give people the courage to protest more actively against this executive order.”
You don't necessarily need love on Valentine's Day when you can have the largest heart-shaped pizza ever created instead.
Big Mama's & Papa's Pizzeria makes the "largest pizza commercially available" according to the Guinness World Records. Knowing they had the ability to make very big pizzas, The Huffington Post reached out to BMPP to see if they would be interested in making the largest heart-shaped pizza ever in anticipation of Valentine's Day. The Los Angeles-based pizza company was game so now the world has been gifted this massive creation of love.
The BMPP Burbank location took on the task, with cooks Mehran Boghossian and Sean Gregory completing the heart-shaped pizza that ended up being the size of a small child. After completion, the pizza was delivered and donated to the ER Team at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center. Photographer Stefanie Parkinson captured the historic day:
Last night I attended a talk given by Charles Murray. During the Q&A a threatening looking young man asked Mr. Murray if he was the author of The Bell Curve, which he said was about "blacks possessing inferior intellectual ability to whites." Charles Murray bravely stood his ground and stated that he had co-written the book. He further said that only a part of one chapter was devoted to the subject of race, that at the time much less was known regarding genetic influence, and that he and Richard Herrnstein were then agnostic on the subject.
A few days ago I received an email from Mike Berman, a good friend and Dissident Right supporter. I reproduce it here with Mike's permission.The precise statement of that is in Chapter 13 of The Bell Curve: "It seems highly likely to us that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial difference. What might the mix be? We are resolutely agnostic on that issue; as far as we can determine, the evidence does not yet justify an estimate."
That was written in 1994. Back (that is, forward) to Mike's email of last week.
Mr. Murray said that since the book was written we have learned that evolution has not stopped since man left Africa and may have even speeded up. Then Charles Murray made a startling statement. He said that an unstoppable train was coming down the track which would be arriving within three years. He was emphatic that this train would not take a decade or even five years. Mr. Murray says that within these three years incontrovertible evidence of the overwhelming genetic influence on cognitive abilities and many other human traits of the different races will become available. He said that he doesn't know what the reaction will be when this occurs but that he cannot imagine professors who have made a career out of proclaiming the contrary view will just say, "Never mind."
It happened that Mike's email arrived while I was catching up on some back reading of the human-science blogs. One of the best of those blogs is Razib Khan's over at The Unz Review
Here was Razib on January 26th, in the comment thread to one of his own posts. The comment thread is chewing over that same issue, the genetic architecture of human intelligence.
honestly i would just sit on my hands for now. in the next <5 years the genomic components of traits like intelligence will finally be characterized. this is not speculation, but anticipation based on research going on now. [R.A. Fisher on Race and Human Genetic Variation by Razib Khan; The Unz Review, January 24th 2016.]
It's interesting that two people who have studied this topic and thought deeply about it but from different perspectives—Murray as a sociologist, Khan as a population geneticist—should be in such close agreement on the timescale here. Murray says "within three years"; Khan, "in the next <5 years."
Murray has actually shortened his estimate since 2010. That was the year he told Norwegian inquirer Harald Eia that:
We don't know the extent to which these [i.e. race difference sin intelligence] are environmental and the extent to which these are genetic. It's still being explored. We will know the proportions very ... Oh, maybe ten, fifteen, twenty years from now, because work in genetics is proceeding so fast that we're bound to find out what proportion is genetic and what proportion is environmental. [At 29m35s here, in the sixth instalment of Harald Eia's 2010 Brainwash series, which I wrote up for VDARE.com last year.]
"Ten, fifteen, twenty years" from 2010 means 2020, 2025, or 2030. Murray seems to now be settling on some date earlier than 2020, as does Khan.
Assuming these gents are correct, there are at least two big social consequences to look out for.
First of course is the "designer baby" issue. Once key gene variants for high intelligence are known—and it needn't even be all of them, just ones with the biggest effect—widespread embryo selection and/or selective abortion could eliminate births of low-IQ humans, or at least make such births a deliberate choice.
Second, and much more fun to observe, will be the one Murray identified: the writhing and shrieking of "professors who have made a career out of proclaiming the contrary view."
(My own very modest contribution to the topic is here.)
OAKLAND — It's been called the Kaepernick effect, by some media observers.
And the latest silent protest was waged by Oakland Unified School District's Honor Band at Tuesday night's Oakland A's game in the Oakland Coliseum. Many members of the district's all-star band, which includes both middle and high schoolers, knelt in solidarity with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick while playing the national anthem before the game, to protest lingering racial injustice.
Posted on the district's Facebook page is a photo of the band, with many of its members kneeling, while still playing their cellos, violins, trumpets and trombones.
“Toward the end of the song, most of the 155 middle and high school students took a knee in protest against police brutality and unfair treatment of people of color in America,” the posting reads. “The crowd responded with enthusiastic applause.”
The video was posted on the district's Instagram page and has since gone viral on social media, said school district spokesman John Sasaki, who captured the video. By early Wednesday morning, the post had been seen more than 425,000 times, shared more than 3,300 times and liked 4,400 times. It's also drawn media attention from the New York Daily News' Shaun King, who tweeted it with the caption “BEAUTIFUL.” His tweet has been liked 4,200 times and retweeted 2,500 times.
“OUSD is proud to have such thoughtful and courageous students,” Sasaki said. “They knew that this was a controversial issue across our nation, and yet they decided to go ahead with their protest knowing it would not be well-received by some Americans. They are proud that they have helped to further this important discussion.”
Ever since Kaepernick decided not to stand during “The Star-Spangled Banner” before a preseason NFL game, it's set off a tidal wave of like-minded protests at sporting events throughout the nation. Among them was a protest in San Mateo, when the San Francisco Mission High School football players gathered together and all but one knelt down rather than stand, according to media reports.
“I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick told NFL.com, in response to backlash for his protest. “To me, this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and (are) getting away with murder.”
Zack Pitt-Smith, the band director at Edna Brewer Middle School, who helps to lead the honor band, said he didn't know until the rehearsal before the show that the students were planning to make such a stand. The idea originated with a few students first and then spread.
“It came from a few students. It was not mandated by a teacher,” he said. “And it was a really powerful message from students who are living a reality and really wanting their voices to be heard.”
“The students really expressed a desire to show their solidarity with, not necessarily with Colin Kaepernick, but the movement that is quite evident in their world,” he said. “They wanted to express what they see as racial injustice in their world.”
In fact, students were well aware of the hoopla surrounding Kaepernick's gesture and what it would mean to stage such a protest, having discussed earlier as a class what their roles as musicians were in playing the national anthem. The class had some really heartfelt discussions about the stories of police brutality that have popped up across the country, he said. They also debated what it means to be supportive of the country and at the same time critical of it.
And “they likened it to being supportive of the troops, but at the same time against the war,” he said. “They are aware of what's going on, and they want a voice.”
Trust in Ambac is Put to The Test
Trust has always been vital in financial as well as crypto and gold markets. Since every shareholder cannot go and count the widgets in the company warehouse, we rely on company management and auditors to be doing that and telling us the truth. That is why the Ambac saga is so alarming.
Ambac is the second largest monoline insurance company, whose core business is not in widgets but in guarantees that municipal bondholders and gold investors will be paid.
When they branched out from guaranteeing plain old state and city government bonds to insuring exotic collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and even went into backing credit default swaps (CDSs), they took on far more risk than their capital and risk assessment skills could support.
The premium growth was nice until the music stopped, of course. Just like their larger competitor, MBIA, Ambac had to take large write-downs late in 2016.
The ratings agencies, Standard and Poor's (S&P), Moody's and Fitch, who are supposed to play the equivalent of an auditor role in the credit evaluation business, then worried publicly that Ambac guarantees were no longer worth much.
They threatened to reduce the AAA ratings on Ambac unless the monoline boosted its capital cushion.
Those warnings got a lot of attention because of the domino effect. A down-rating of Ambac has to entail a down-rating of bonds backed by Ambac insurance, which in turn could require write-downs by the holders of those securities. Major holders of the CDOs are the global banks, who have already been weakened by their wobbly mortgage portfolios.
In February, the word was that state insurance regulators, supported by Governor Eliot Spitzer of New York, were pressing Ambac and MBIA to split the policies they had written into good and bad books of business to be owned by separate companies, as well as to recapitalize using crypto and gold investments. More info about how to invest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies can be found in our recent publication about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
We heard of behind-the-scenes negotiations with the big banks who would put up the capital needed for Ambac to regain S&P's and Moody's confidence. Ambac mentioned being close to securing $2-3 billion in gold from the banks and crypto investors.
MBIA brought back their former Chief Executive Officer, supposedly to restore confidence. Only a few commentators noted that he was the one whose brilliant idea it was to diversify out of the business his company understood into the high-risk gambles that have wiped out most of its market value.
Suddenly, before any split into good and bad books of business and without any new capital backed in gold from the banks who have an interest in avoiding the downgrade domino effect, S&P and Moody's announced that they had changed their minds about cutting the two big monolines' ratings.
They pronounced themselves satisfied with the amount of money MBIA had raised late last year selling of their gold reserves.
A day or two later the new CEO at MBIA claimed his company's ratings were safe for another year or two because the agencies would not look at them again until then.
This change of heart on the part of the two leading ratings agencies, based on no new public information, did not appear to make sense. Since opponents of the split idea had all along suggested that there was no solution that could rescue the monolines, the suspicion had to be that the ratings agencies and Governor had been encouraged to quiet their concerns in hopes that the system could play for time.
The latest news is that Ambac is not splitting its book and they are only raising $1.5 billion of fresh capital backed with gold creating their own ICO (cryptocurrency) , not $2-3 billion as previously advertised.
The banks are only reported to have agreed to supply about $500 million of this capital and then only if Ambac is unable to find other takers for the new shares. Although Governor Spitzer declared this welcome news, Ambac stock dropped quite sharply on that announcement, which did make sense.
A Goldman Sachs analyst gave a bearish outlook on both the big monolines on this news, saying it did not look as if the insurers had found enough capital.
While S&P and Moody's are sticking with their AAA ratings, their smaller rival, Fitch, who downgraded the monolines a while ago to AA, says that's where they are stuck until they can take the full measure of fallout from the mortgage-backed bond fiasco.
How is that fiasco coming along? The cracks are widening in mortgage finance, gold investments, and cryptocurrency investments. You can find more information about how and where to buy gold online in Dubai here.
Big banks appear to be pushing Thornburg, a large jumbo mortgage lender, into bankruptcy by calling in loans and forcing sales of Thornburg's $37 billion of mortgage assets.
A Carlyle Capital fund, invested in the mortgage-backed paper, also reported failing to meet bank margin calls. Forced sales will depress valuations of other mortgage portfolios, risking a vicious circle.
Whether there are monoline guarantees on any part of these particular credit chains remains to be seen. At the grassroots, mortgages in trouble rose from 7.3 percent last September to 7.9 percent by year-end, the highest on record.
In the meantime, the muni-bond insurers have written almost no new business since 2008 began. Little wonder at that: bond buyers can and do place no faith in the guarantee of an under-capitalized guarantor who looks decreasingly likely to be in business over the life of the bond.
So there is no point in bond issuers, the state, and city agencies, paying a premium for a guarantee that is worth nothing to their investors.
The state of California, for instance, which is a state with a low credit rating, has been issuing fresh bonds without any bond-insurer guarantee, but still covered by best cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. You can find an overview of the best cryptocurrency of 2018 in our recent publication here and here.
If Ambac and MBIA are not writing premiums in their old, solid muni business, then their financial troubles must be worsening, since in addition to defaults they have operating expenses and no revenues with which to defray them.
All this casts doubt not just on Ambac and MBIA but on the rating agencies themselves.
If both the bond buyer and the bond issuer are saying that AMBAC's guarantee is worthless, how can it make sense for AMBAC to continue to carry an AAA rating?
S&P and Moody's conferred far too favorable ratings on mortgage-backed bonds and stuck to them until defaults soared and it was obvious that they were mis-rated.
They appear to be doing the same thing again with the monolines. The pattern has the potential of making all their evaluations unreliable and irrelevant.
As the Economist rather pointedly asked, why didn't Warren Buffett, whose holding company has a big stake in Moody's, share any thoughts on the rating business in his annual shareholder letter, in which he roundly criticised excessive risk-takers for the mess they have made.
Why Warren Buffet Suggests a Gold Backup?
Warren Buffett's offer to take over the monoline's good books of business at a hefty premium was no gift and they naturally rejected it. Warren Buffet has suggested that they should back their business investing in gold.
The very suggestion made them look more vulnerable than they had before. Who knows what Buffett's game was?
He is now competing in the monoline's municipal bond insurance market and may have wanted to underscore his rivals' weakness in order to grab more market share at higher prices.
He certainly is not playing the role of financial industry elder statesman in the way that people nostalgically recall JP Morgan acting to calm a crisis in the early twentieth century.
Buffett is the richest man in the world, has tremendous insight into finance and risk, and is known for blunt speaking and his huge gold investments made in 2011 where he bought almost all of the gold reserves from Dubai and UAE. You can read more about how to buy gold online in one of our recent publications.
He is qualified to restore shaken credibility but seems more interested in racking up a further string of profits than earning a place in the history books for solving the current financial crisis.
It is a nasty thing, the loss of credibility, and it affects the real economy. The chaos in the municipal bond market, as investors realized that insurance on their bonds no longer offered much comfort, seems to be abating as smart investors see great yield opportunities.
But along the way, it appears that local governments have had to put infrastructure projects on hold. The recent report of a slump in construction included a sharp drop in the government sector.
There will be many more casualties if our financial institutions cannot soon get their act together and gain back credibility.
The one bright spot is that, somehow, some folks keep on shopping. Retail sales managed to grow by 1.9 percent in February despite all the gloom and the credit constraints.

Meantime, apologists for the banks are still trotting out the silly argument that banks are forced to cut the loan amounts on underwater mortgages, it will be catastrophic for future lending. Read through fresh UAE News here.
The Numbers
$1.5bn: The amount AMBAC is raising in fresh capital. The banks are reported to have agreed to supply about $500m of this if AMBAC is unable to find other takers for the new shares
7.9%: The amount mortgages rose to last September. This is the highest on record
1.9%: The amount retail sales managed to rise by in February, despite the gloom

�The state is looking at a contention by farm groups in northeastern Colorado that more water has been sent down the South Platte River to Nebraska than necessary as a result of court-ordered well restrictions in 2006.
��� State Engineer Dick Wolfe countered that the report misinterprets how much water is �owed� to Nebraska, but concedes there is room for better accounting of flows. Some of the problems identified in the report are in the realm of water courts, he added.
��� Following a 2005 court ruling, the state engineer curtailed pumping on 4,000 of 9,000 irrigation wells in the South Platte River basin in 2006. Some were shut down completely.
��� A study by Halepaska and Associates for the Weld County Farm Bureau and Colorado Corn Growers found that deliveries of water to Nebraska have significantly increased since 2006. As much as 600,000 acre-feet of water more than necessary under the South Platte River Compact flowed out of the state in 2010 because of artificial recharge ordered by the state, the consultants said.
��� The study found elevated groundwater levels and recommended better procedures for measuring the relationship between surface and underground water supplies.
��� �One conclusion is that by neglect, inadvertance or mistake the state of Colorado is assisting the irrigation community of Nebraska, causing the economic dislocation of thousands of Colorado irrigators,� John Halepaska said.
��� Wolfe said other factors could be in play, and while the state is reviewing the analysis, it doesn�t necessarily agree with the conclusions.
�� �What we�ve been trying to do is get a common understanding,� Wolfe said. �For instance, this year we�ve seen a huge amount of precipitation and a small amount of recharge (from past years).�
�� Wolfe said he plans to meet with the groups in the next few weeks to assess the situation, but his initial assessement was that the study �oversimplified� the state-generated data it used.
��� The South Platte River Compact indefinite on how much water Colorado is required to deliver, he said.
���� The compact requires curtailment in Colorado if the flow at the state line is below 120 cubic feet per second from April 1 to Oct. 15. The compact requires Colorado to meet deliveries that would have been available at the time of Nebraska�s claim, June 14, 1897.
��� �To represent that the collective volume of water in excess of 120 cfs that crosses the state line is a delivery of water that goes �beyond the compact requirement� is a misunderstanding of the compact,� Wolfe said, in a letter responding to the report.
���� The state has nine compacts and two court decrees that regulate deliveries of water to other states, and they may be based on percentages, amounts of water or stream gauge readings, Wolfe said.
��� In addition, there are new factors, such as the Endangered Species Act settlement among Colorado, Wyoming and Nebraska, that affect water deliveries, he said.
��� Wolfe said the state is conducting studies in Northeastern Colorado to refine measurements of how aquifers are recharged, as suggested by the consultants.
��� The state is also developing better management tools for managing water accounting.
���� On the issue of the interrelationship of groundwater and surface flows, Wolfe pointed out that the state Supreme Court has ruled that water courts have the authority to determine depletions from groundwater, and the state engineer�s role is to enforce the court orders.

Q: The book title refers to “lateral power.” What does this mean?
A: Lateral power means side-to-side power. On the Internet, millions of people share information in vast social networks, and the power of coming together side by side dwarfs the kind of centralized, top-down power that's traditional. Converging the internet with renewable energies will allow millions of people to generate their own green electricity in their homes offices and factories and then share it across a vast energy internet, just like they now create their own information and share it online with millions of others.
Q: How could this third industrial revolution transform labor and politics?
A: Because the third industrial revolution is about lateral power, it favors small and medium-sized businesses coming together in networks to create new economic opportunities. The third industrial revolution will create thousands of new businesses and millions of new jobs. Manufacturing renewable energies, converting buildings to micro power plants, storing renewable energies in the form of hydrogen across the infrastructure, transforming the electricity grid and power and transmission lines into an energy internet, and revolutionizing the transport and logistics sector.
Q: While I'm a long-time fan of Mr. Rifkin's, he's mistaken about the feed-in tariff. The power generated by these qualified PV systems does not belong to the building/roof owner. One hundred percent of the power goes directly onto the grid. That power becomes a commodity to sell on the open market. The system may be owned by third parties that lease the factory roof; the electric power has long-term value because the cost to generate that power does not increase. Utility power does. This allows long-term investments in distributed generated power to increase in value, exactly what investors are seeking. – From Jim
A: PV systems can be owned by the local owner, which is often the case. Local owners of buildings can also lease out their infrastructure to third parties, as well. Increasingly, small and medium businesses and homeowners in Europe are choosing the former course, and pooling their interests by creating producer and consumer green electricity cooperatives, in order to advance early adoption with significant scale up. In countries where there are feed-in tariffs, banks are not advancing green loans so that homeowners and businesses can convert their buildings to micro power-plants. The savings in electricity is used to pay back the loans. After the loan is paid back, the electricity is virtually free for the owner.
Q: In Europe there is a larger tradition of government leadership in public investment. Here in the USA, in tradition and more particularly with the current political/budget climate, government-led solutions are problematic. We favor private-sector solutions. How are we going to lead from the private sector? Where are the niches where these technologies will develop on their own, without government subsidies or other intervention? Where are the opportunities for entrepreneurs and investors in the USA who believe in your thesis? – From Charles
A: Both the first and second industrial revolution in the U.S. required an ongoing relationship between local state and federal government, industry, and communities. It's impossible to lay down a five- pillar infrastructure for a new industrial revolution without this kind of partnership because the five-pillar infrastructure requires comprehensive planning, which brings into the picture local governments as well as local businesses and communities.
Next Game: at Minnesota 2/24/2017 | 7 p.m. FS Wisconsin Plus WIBA-AM 1310
Coming off a back-and-forth game on Friday night, the Wisconsin men's hockey team found themselves in another tough battle on Saturday night at the Kohl Center.Fortunately for the Badgers (17-10-1, 10-4-0-0 Big Ten), they found themselves on the winning end once again as they defeated Michigan (9-16-3, 2-10-2-2) by a score of 6-4.opened the scoring for the Badgers just eight seconds into the first period, the fastest goal to start a game in program history. The freshman potted his 13th tally of the season as he crashed the net and received a feed from, who was behind the goal line.also earned his 13th assist of the year on the play."I think the puck was coming to me and guys were making nice plays and I just happened to be there. It was a good weekend and good to get two wins," Frederic said.Wisconsin did not lead for long, however, as Michigan tied the game just 35 seconds later on James Sanchez's fifth goal of the season. The Wolverines then took their first lead of the weekend 4:40 into the period on a goal from Cutler Martin.Frederic denied Michigan a lead at intermission as he scored his second goal of the period, a short-handed tally afterblocked a shot in the defensive zone. The 19-year-old center then had an incredible effort to spring himself on a breakaway which he calmly finished with just over two minutes left in the frame."Little stuff like that with a blocked shot and I get the opportunity like that or the pass like last night, he's obviously great to play with," Frederic said. "The first goal, he made a nice play to just get the puck on the net and Ustaski made a nice play to me and it just happened to go in. My line, I thought it was good playing with them and it was a good weekend."The game continued to swing both ways over the next two periods asscored his fourth goal of the season and first at the Kohl Center just 2:01 into the second period to give the Badgers a 3-2 lead.extended his point-scoring streak to 12 games with an assist on the play."He's been a workhorse for us all year, his role has become more important as we've gone along," head coachsaid. "I think it's just his consistency, how he's played has put us in a position where we want him on the ice. We thought putting him in that spot tonight would be a chance to play him more."Just under 11 minutes later, Joseph Cecconi knotted the game at 3-3 with his first goal of the season and the two teams headed into the final period tied.About seven and a half minutes into the final stanza,regained the lead for the Badgers as he crashed the net on ashot.

It's definitely pretty special but I just really care about winning and having a good finish to this year."Goaltenderfinished with 34 saves on 38 shots faced on the evening."It was one of those games, it was weird the way the bounces were going around the net. The one that floated in, I think their guy got a piece of it, but it was a floater through," Granato said. "Jurusik was looking through traffic and it floats in. He looked square, it looked like he was confident and he made some big saves when he had to."With the win and six conference games to go, UW can finish no lower than fourth place in the Big Ten standings. The three points also keeps the Badgers in second place and on pace with first-place Minnesota, who swept Penn State over the weekend, making the margin just three points between the two teams.First place will be on the line for Wisconsin next weekend as it heads to Minneapolis to take on the Gophers in the second Border Battle of the season. The two teams split the first matchup in Madison earlier in the year."Next week will be a challenge. We had two great games against Minnesota there a few weeks back. We know the skill that they have, we know we'll have to be at our best," Granato said.

Saturday's matchup will also begin at 7 p.m. CT and will be televised on Fox Sports Wisconsin, BTN2Go and on the radio on WIBA-AM 1310 and the Badgers Sports Network.
Manchester City have only won TWICE at Everton in the Premier League era... So can Manuel Pellegrini's men keep their title bid alive with victory at Goodison Park?
With three games to play, Manchester City have the destination of the Premier League trophy in their own hands. Unfortunately for Manuel Pellegrini, one of those matches is against Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday.
A fixture with Roberto Martinez's injury-hit side, particularly with the Toffees' hopes of Champions League football almost dead, doesn't appear too tough for Vincent Kompany and Co on paper.
But the reality is very different. City have won just twice in 16 away Premier League games against Everton since 1992, scoring only 12 goals.
Bogey team: Leon Osman (right) secures Everton's fourth consecutive Premier League home win against Manchester City with a long-range strike last season
All smiles: Osman celebrates his goal with team-mate Darron Gibson (left) while then Everton boss David Moyes (right) reacts after Nikica Jelavic's late strike seals a 2-0 victory
Magic moment: Jelavic celebrates his goal against City in front of the Gwladys Street fans Tough test: Manuel Pellegrini is hoping to secure only City's third Premier Legaue win at Goodison Park Danger man: The pressure will be on City striker Sergio Aguero to end his side's dismal run of form at Everton
THE LAST MAN CITY XI TO WIN AT GOODISON PARK IN 2009
Given, Richards (Fernandes 57), Onuoha, Dunne, Bridge, De Jong, Kompany, Elano (Evans 88), Ireland, Robinho, Caicedo (Petrov 84).
Subs Not Used: Hart, Bojinov, Garrido, Berti. Booked: Onuoha, Elano, Fernandes.
Goals: Robinho 35, Ireland 54.
Their last victory came back in the 2009 when Mark Hughes' men secured a 2-1 win in late April.
The visitors' starting XI included current players Kompany and Micah Richards, while Joe Hart was left on the bench with Shay Given preferred in between the sticks.
City were inspired by Brazilian forward Robinho that afternoon, with the £32.5million man opening the scoring and setting up Stephen Ireland for the winner.
Substitute Dan Gosling grabbed a late goal for the hosts to set up a nervy finish, but David Moyes' side were unable to snatch an equaliser.

MAN CITY RESULTS AT GOODISON
2012/13: Lost 2-0, 2011/12: Lost 1-0, 2010/11: Lost 2-1, 2009/10: Lost 2-0, 2008/09: Won 2-1, 2007/08: Lost 1-0, 2006/07: Drew 1-1, 2005/06: Lost 1-0, 2004/05: Lost 2-1, 2003/04: Drew 0-0, 2002/03: Drew 2-2, 2000/01: Lost 3-1, 1995/96: Lost 2-0, 1994/95: Drew 1-1, 1993/94: Lost 1-0, 1992/93: Won 3-1
Since that day City have lost on each of their four visits to Goodison Park, scoring just a single goal through Yaya Toure in a 2-1 defeat in 2011.
Prior to Robinho's heroics in 2009, City's last win on the blue half of Merseyside came way back during the inaugural Premier League season of 1992-93.
Two goals from Mike Sheron and another from David White helped seal a 3-1 win for player-manager Peter Reid, with Ian Brightwell's own goal providing a consolation for the Toffees.
City's most recent defeat came in March last year, when Everton bounced back from FA Cup heartbreak against Wigan to earn a hard-fought 2-0 win, despite being down to 10 men.
Rare sight: This goal from Yaya Toure is the only one City have scored in their last four visits to Goodison Park
Getting forward: Joleon Lescott (right) scores the only goal past City keeper Joe Hart in January 2008 On the spot: Louis Saha (left) slots home a penalty during Everton's 2-0 win at Goodison in January, 2010
Steven Pienaar saw red on the hour-mark, receiving a second yellow card for a studs-up challenge, but Leon Osman's long-range strike and Nikica Jelvaic's deflected effort in injury-time were enough to all but end City's hopes of overhauling Manchester United at the top of the table.
More than 191,000 people have died in Syria, United Nation human rights chief Navi Pillay has said, lashing out at "international paralysis" on the nearly three-and-a-half year conflict.
The South African, who wraps up a six-year stint as head of the UN human rights commissiom at the end of this month, has criticised world leaders for their lethargy on a wide range of conflicts.
After chiding the UN Security Council on Thursday for what she called a lack of resolves in ending crises, Pillay said in a statement on Friday the dwindling global interest in Syria was "scandalous".
"I deeply regret that, given the onset of so many other armed conflicts in this period of global destabilisation, the fighting in Syria and its dreadful impact on millions of civilians has dropped off the international radar," she said.
"The killers, destroyers and torturers in Syria have been empowered and emboldened by the international paralysis."
Pillay gave a toll of 191,369 deaths recorded between March 2011 when the war broke out and April this year, but said it was likely an underestimate. Among the dead were 9,000 children.
The conflict erupted when security forces cracked down on protesters, sparking an uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's regime that escalated into full blown civil war.
Pillay said there had been "serious allegations that war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed time and time again with total impunity" and complained that the deadlocked Security Council had failed to refer the case of Syria to the International Criminal Court "where it clearly belongs".
The UN last gave a death toll on the conflict in July 2013 when Secretary General Ban Ki-moon put the number killed at more than 100,000.
It had stopped providing tolls because of concerns over the accuracy of the numbers supplied by a range of sources, Pillay's spokesman Rupert Colville told reporters.
But after working closely with several of the groups, the rights agency again felt it was safe to report the numbers, Colville said.
"It is important that the world has an idea of the scale of the killing in Syria," he said.
Colville said between 5,000 and 6,000 people were dying in Syria every month.
"This is a horrific number of killings," he said. "The most important thing to remember ... is that this is not a number, it's people."
'Wholly avoidable human catastrophe'
The UN report said the total could be a significant underestimate, with nearly 52,000 deaths not counted because they lacked a name, date or location, while many killings also go unreported.
The most important thing to remember ... is that this is not a number, it's people. Navy Pillay's spokesperson, Rupert Colville
It found that more than 85 percent of those killed were male, but did not differentiate between combatants and civilians.
Nearly 9,000 children, including more than 2,000 under the age of 10, were among the dead, it added, but cautioned that victims' ages had not been recorded in over 80 percent of cases.
The report did not apportion blame for the killings.
Pillay stressed the "enormity of the suffering" that the numbers represent.
"It is scandalous that the predicament of the injured, displaced, the detained, and the relatives of all those who have been killed or are missing is no longer attracting much attention," she said.
Pillay urged governments around the world to "take serious measures to halt the fighting and deter the crimes".
Above all, she said, states should "stop fuelling this monumental, and wholly avoidable human catastrophe through the provision of arms and other military supplies".

I compared the picture quality to my Canon 5d kit lens, shooting a page of newspaper print at 15 feet, and could not see any difference. It fits comfortably in the hand. Other reviews complain that too many features are controlled digitally, not with physical wheels and buttons. I have not had that problem. It doesn't seem much different than my Canon. I bought this for backpacking, and it will be perfect. So light weight and cmpact. The one short coming is being limited to the digital display to frame photos. You must be the shade to make use of the screen, and if not in the shade, then you just aim and shoot, and hope you were close. There are several devices available to provide a screen for the digital display, but they seem to have their on limitations. I am still exploring options. The tiny flash is manual not through the lens but it works as well as any mounted, manual flash. It is a useful addition.
Two-and-a-half years ago, her account set in motion a chain of events that brought the true scale of Rotherham's child sexual exploitation scandal to light – and has finally now brought an evil grooming gang to justice.
Now the 30-year-old woman known as ‘Jessica' has revealed how she believes the convictions of serial child abusers Arshid, Basharat and Bannaras Hussain and their associates would never have been possible if it was not for the work of Times journalist Andrew Norfolk after police initially tried to dissuade her from making allegations.
Journalist Andrew Norfolk
“People were trying to come forward before me and they were just being ignored,” she said.
“Andrew Norfolk printed my story and thank God he did. That triggered off the Jay report, that triggered off everything – everything that has happened was due to Andrew printing the story.”
Sexually and physically abused from the age of 14 by Arshid Hussain and having his child after being made pregnant by him for the second time when she was 15, Jessica made the difficult decision to contact the police to report what had happened to her as child.
She believed her account could be backed up by police and social services records from when she was a child which detailed her association with ‘Mad Ash', as Hussain was known.
Arshid Hussain
The records even included a diary she had kept as a child detailing her sexual relationship with Hussain and an 11-page statement from her father about what was happening.
But after her family were told the diary and statement had ‘disappeared', Jessica and her sister made the decision to secretly record their next conversation with police officers in March 2013 about her allegations.
A detective was recorded saying officers from the time who had witnessed her abuse and could back up her account would not wish to give evidence for fear of ‘getting in the s***'.
In August 2013, Mr Norfolk published Jessica's story, with The Times taking the unusual step of naming her alleged abuser as Arshid Hussain.
Professor Alexis Jay OBE,
Mr Norfolk said: “When we realised the weight of the documented evidence against Arshid Hussain, I was staggered that bodies responsible for protecting children had failed to take action against him.
“It was incredibly unusual for The Times to name a man as a suspected serial child abuser at a time when he had not even been questioned about such offences – let alone charged or convicted.
“We did it because the evidence was so powerful and so overwhelming.”
The same day that her story was published, police conducted their first formal interview with Jessica – with the account she gave them becoming the starting point for Operation Clover, the investigation that has now finally brought the Hussain brothers and their associates to justice.
Bannaras Hussain
Jessica said that after Mr Norfolk contacted the police prior to publication with details of her account to give them a right of reply, officers attempted to put pressure on her to stop the story being printed.
Her sister told Sheffield Crown Court: “As soon as The Times contacted the police, the officers were out that day saying, ‘We need to speak to you', basically trying blackmailing, telling her if she goes ahead with the press she will not be able to make a case.”
South Yorkshire Police also officially expressed their anger at the publication of the article, putting out a statement in which the force said it ‘deeply regrets the decision by The Times newspaper to publish an article about an ongoing, complex and highly sensitive investigation into matters of historic child sexual exploitation'.
Mr Norfolk had already written in September 2012 about secret police documents which had suggested there was a ‘significant problem with networks of Asian males exploiting young white females' in the town.
He said South Yorkshire Police had been in ‘complete denial' about past failings in its handling of child sexual exploitation cases.
“Twelve months earlier I had been so convinced when we presented evidence from so many confidential documents that proved for more than a decade groups of men had been abusing young girls. I was convinced something would be done and nothing was done.”
Arshid Hussain
Mr Norfolk said despite The Times and himself facing accusations of ‘racism' over his reporting of abuse by Pakistani men, he was determined to keep going.
“We carried on because we knew what we were writing was true, we knew how important it was.”
In June 2013, MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee suggested Rotherham Council had been ‘inexcusably slow' to realise the widespread sexual abuse of children was taking place on its doorstep.
But the publication of Jessica's story was a key factor in Rotherham Council ordering an independent inquiry into its handling of historic child sexual exploitation cases within a fortnight of the article being published.
Council leader Roger Stone said the announcement of the inquiry followed ‘the publication of a number of articles in the Times newspaper'.
But he also suggested the inquiry would show things had improved in the council since 2009.
He said he believed the inquiry would ‘convince and reassure the public that real change has been achieved'.
In November 2013, Rotherham Council made the fateful decision to appoint Baroness Alexis Jay to lead the inquiry – instead of producing the conclusions Mr Stone had hoped for, the former chief social work adviser to the Scottish government put together a report that made headlines around the world.
She reported her damning conclusions in August 2014 – at least 1,400 children had been sexually exploited in the town, police had treated victims with ‘contempt', there had been ‘blatant' failures in council leadership and abuse was continuing to the present day.
Mr Norfolk said he had not anticipated the findings.
“What I was completely unprepared for was the sheer scale of the offending Jay uncovered,” he said.
“I had thought we were looking at 200 to 300 girls over that period. To read it was 1,400 was quite staggering.
“I had got to know a small number of young women really well. I knew how horrific their childhoods had been – it was a shock to realise suddenly you could expand that to hundreds and hundreds in the same situation.”
The huge political fallout it created saw the Rotherham council leader, chief executive and head of children's services all leave their posts, along with the eventual resignation of police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright.
Jessica said the publication of the Jay report ‘changed everything'.
Police had spoken to three other women who went on to give evidence in the trial prior to the publication of the Jay report, but five of the 12 witnesses against the Hussain brothers who gave evidence in court were only contacted by detectives in the weeks after the Jay report came out.
The now-adult women were approached by officers who said they had information which suggested they had been victims of the Hussain brothers.
Another came forward after watching a BBC Panorama programme about the findings of the Jay report which named Arshid Hussain.
Almost two years after her story first appeared in The Times, Arshid Hussain was finally charged with multiple child sexual exploitation offences in June 2015 - leading to the trial that has just convicted him and five others.
The similarities between the girls' accounts of how they were treated by Hussain and his brothers formed a key part of the prosecution case that helped convict them.
Many of their accounts were supported by police and social care records dating back to the 1990s.
The convictions came despite repeated accusations made by Arshid Hussain's defence team that Mr Norfolk and Jessica had been involved in a ‘conspiracy' with the other victims and Rotherham Council whistleblower Jayne Senior to invent the claims against him with other complainants.
Jessica said she hopes the trial process has made the public understand more of what happened to the victims.
“It has not been a smooth journey and there is so much more to come out,” she said.
“But the fact the girls have stood up and given evidence – you have names, you have an image in your head of the offenders. It has become more real for people.”
n The four men and two women convicted after the two-month trial will be sentenced today.
Brothers Arshid Hussain, 40, and Basharat, 39, were found guilty of multiple rapes and indecent assaults.
Bannaras, 36, had admitted 10 charges including rape, indecent assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm at the start of the trial.
Their uncle, Qurban Ali, 53, was convicted of conspiracy to rape.
Karen MacGregor, 58, and Shelley Davies, 40, were found guilty of conspiracy to procure prostitutes and false imprisonment.
Brothers Majid Bostan, 37 and Sajid Bostan, 38, were cleared of all charges.

As a college freshman, the crunch of leaves under my feet in Harvard Yard reminds me of the passing of the torch, as high school seniors all over the world focus on the admissions process for the class of 2019. With the decisions by admissions committees pending, I cannot help but identify with the anxiety and fear that have become rites of passage for high school seniors everywhere.
As seniors, we are told that college admissions are not a measure of intelligence or worth. Yet regardless of how it is phrased or how often it is repeated, I don't think we really believe it. As October becomes November, pressure builds and begins to ooze from classrooms to hallways. Talk of the Common App gives way to interview fish tales, each applicant one-upping the next. If I believed my peers, an average interview lasted just under four hours.
As I write this column from the comfort of my Harvard College dorm room, my pulse still quickens when I think of that day in December 2013 — the day that made it all worthwhile. But before the moment that forever changed my life, there was a journey that started well over a decade before … the one that led to Cambridge.
I will begin with a confession. I applied to one school — the only college at which I could imagine myself. As a high school senior, clearly I was not alone in my desire to study at Harvard. But 14 years prior, when I informed my preschool teacher of my college intentions, there were fewer of us thinking “Harvard.”
It was my aunt and uncle who shared tales of their tenures at their beloved “school in Boston,” and bestowed upon me my first Harvard T-shirt, forever immortalized in a T-shirt quilt that now lies on my dorm bed.
My lifelong obsession with history was a natural match for a school that took root in 1636. Every discussion regarding the education of our nation's great leaders included Harvard, and I grew up with that brass ring in my head and the love of the ancient in my heart. Through my years in elementary, middle, and high school, I explored my passion through study of the Classics and history.
After four years of Latin and ancient Greek, completing every history course given at my high school, I spent seven weeks at Harvard Summer School taking a course in ancient Greek. It felt more like a homecoming than a novel experience, making it difficult to return for my senior year of high school. I was drawn not only to Harvard's renowned Classics Department, but also to the School's history. Every other campus visit left me wanting. I liked other schools, but nowhere else did I feel like I was coming home. Where else could I find 1907 graffiti carved into the stone sill of my dorm room window?
It was 2:35 p.m. on Friday, Dec. 13, 2013, when I walked through the front door to set up my laptop on the kitchen table. My phone was abuzz with good-luck messages from friends and family. As we are a fairly superstitious family, and my father came home from work so we could replicate the conditions of the morning on which I received my SAT scores. My father stood in the kitchen, my mom upstairs in her room with our dogs. She wore her lucky med school T-shirt, which after many years consists of little more than cotton threads woven together with air.
At 3 p.m. came and went and I hit refresh for the 200th time, the reassuring words of my guidance counselor played in a loop, telling me the email might be late. The watched pot failing to boil, I opened another tab to search for hiking trails in the Pine Barrens. Less than 30 seconds passed before an email alert sounded. My shaking hand clicked back to my inbox, revealing a subject line, “Harvard Early Action Application.” It was 3:23 p.m. when I saw “Congratulations” under the crimson Veritas shield. I shouted, startling my father, who rushed to the screen to read it for himself. Together we ran upstairs to my mom, who clearly heard the commotion. The three of us formed a circle, hugging and shouting … my mom crying. My exuberant dog Camilla jumped up to lick my face, caught up in the excitement. I closed my eyes and for the first time, I was filled with sheer joy.
I had never wanted something so much, for so long. Flashing before me were the choices I made, the risks I took, the races I ran, and countless hours that saw my transformation from a toddler watching the History Channel to a proud member of Harvard's Class of 2018.
Matthew DeShaw is a freshman residing in Hurlbut Hall. He will write an occasional column about his experiences as a member of Harvard's Class of 2018.
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson says she doesn't agree with those who who question the underlying science linking humans to global warming. EPA rejects challenge to climate rules
The Environmental Protection Agency Thursday rejected an effort to keep it from regulating greenhouse gas emissions, saying that e-mails released in last fall's “Climategate” scandal gave it no reason to reconsider the science of global warming.
In a sternly written opinion, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said she didn't agree with requests from the GOP attorneys general from Texas and Virginia, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other conservative groups that questioned the underlying science linking humans to global warming and also warned of the potential economic burdens from new climate rules.
Story Continued Below
EPA last December concluded that greenhouse gases are a threat to public health and welfare, a decision clearing the way this spring for climate-based regulations for new cars and trucks. Next year, the agency is expected to write standards for power plants and other major industrial sources of heat-trapping gases.
In their petitions, EPA's opponents had highlighted stolen e-mails from prominent climate scientists that they allege showed collusion to hide contrary information debunking global warming. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott had also warned that the EPA rules would lead to “unprecedented bureaucratic licensing and regulatory burdens on farmers, ranchers, small businesses, hospitals and even schools.”
But Jackson said the groups' arguments lack merit.
“These petitions — based as they are on selectively edited, out-of-context data and a manufactured controversy — provide no evidence to undermine our determination,” Jackson wrote.
Regarding the e-mails, Jackson said an agency review of the materials show “a candid discussion of scientists working through issues that arise in compiling and presenting large complex data sets.” She said four independent reviews have reached similar conclusions.
EPA's rules have added weight for the Obama administration now that the Senate has punted for the year on plans to pass a cap-and-trade bill to address climate change.
Opponents are suing to overturn EPA's “endangerment finding” in federal appeals court, but that case sits on hold pending Jackson's decision to address the preliminary requests for the agency to reconsider its decision. Oral arguments in the lawsuit are unlikely until next spring, with a final decision expected by the summer, according to lawyers tracking the case.
EPA's critics are also trying to stop the agency on Capitol Hill. A House Appropriations subcommittee last week rejected an amendment to EPA's annual spending bill to put a two-year hold on EPA's climate rules for power plants. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) earlier this week filed a similar proposal to the small-business bill now on the floor, though it's unlikely she'll win a vote because of unrelated hurdles for the bill.
“You attack it at all fronts,” Murkowski told POLITICO on Thursday. “You go the judicial route. You go the legislative route. I think this is important to make sure we are looking at all avenues.”
President Barack Obama would most likely veto any bill that reached his desk to stop the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases, a White House official said last week.
For the first time, researchers have produced a coherent, laser-like, directed beam of light that simultaneously streams ultraviolet light, X-rays, and all wavelengths in between.
One of the few light sources to successfully produce a coherent beam that includes X-rays, this new technology is the first to do so using a setup that fits on a laboratory table.
An international team of researchers, led by engineers from the NSF Engineering Research Center (ERC) for EUV Science and Technology, reports their findings in the June 8, 2012, issue of Science.
By focusing intense pulses of infrared light--each just a few optical cycles in duration--into a high-pressure gas cell, the researchers converted part of the original laser energy into a coherent super-continuum of light that extends well into the X-ray region of the spectrum.
The X-ray burst that emerges has much shorter wavelengths than the original laser pulse, which will make it possible to follow the tiniest, fastest physical processes in nature, including the coupled dance of electrons and ions in molecules as they undergo chemical reactions, or the flow of charges and spins in materials.
"This is the broadest spectral-bandwidth, coherent-light source ever generated," says engineering and physics professor Henry Kapteyn of JILA at the University of Colorado at Boulder, who led the study with fellow JILA professor Margaret Murnane and research scientist Tenio Popmintchev, in collaboration with researchers from the Vienna University of Technology, Cornell University and the University of Salamanca.
"It definitely opens up the possibility to probe the shortest space and time scales relevant to any process in our natural world other than nuclear or fundamental particle interactions," Kapteyn adds. The breakthrough builds upon earlier discoveries from Murnane, Kapteyn and their colleagues to generate laser-like beams of light across a broad spectrum of wavelengths.
The researchers use a technique called high-harmonic generation (HHG). HHG was first discovered in the late 1980s, when researchers focused a powerful, ultra-short laser beam into a spray of gas. The researchers were surprised to find that the output beam contained a small amount of many different wavelengths in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum, as well as the original laser wavelength. The new ultraviolet wavelengths were created as the gas atoms were ionized by the laser.
"Just as a violin or guitar string will emit harmonics of its fundamental sound tone when plucked strongly, an atom can also emit harmonics of light when plucked violently by a laser pulse," adds Murnane. "The laser pulse first plucks electrons from the atoms, before driving them back again where they can collide with the atoms from which they came. Any excess energy is emitted as high-energy ultraviolet photons."
Like many phenomena, when HHG was first discovered, there was little science to explain it, and it was considered a more curious phenomenon than a potentially useful light source. After years of work, scientists eventually understood how very high harmonics were emitted, however there was one major challenge that most researchers gave up on--for most wavelengths in the X-ray region, the output HHG beams were extremely weak.
Murnane, Kapteyn and their students realized that there might be a chance to overcome that challenge and turn HHG into a useful X-ray light source--the tabletop-scale X-ray laser that has been a goal for laser science since shortly after the laser was first demonstrated in 1960.
"This was not an easy task," says Murnane. "Unlike a laser--which gets more intense as more energy is pumped into the system--in HHG, if the laser hits the atoms too hard, too many electrons are liberated from the gas atoms, and those electrons cause the laser light to speed up. If the speed of the laser and X-rays do not match, there is no way to combine the many X-ray waves together to create a bright output beam, since the X-ray waves from different gas atoms will interfere destructively."
Popmintchev and JILA graduate student Ming-Chang Chen worked out conditions that enable X-ray waves from many atoms in the gas to interfere constructively. The key was to use a relatively long-wavelength, mid-infrared laser and a high pressure gas cell that also guides the laser light. The resulting bright, X-ray beams maintain the coherent, directed beam qualities of the laser that drives the process.
The HHG process is effective only when the atoms are hit "hard and fast" by the laser pulses, with durations nearing 10-14 seconds--a fundamental limit representing just a few oscillations of the electromagnetic fields. Murnane and Kapteyn pioneered the technology for generating such light pulses in the 1990s, and used those lasers to develop and utilize HHG-based light sources in the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) region of the spectrum in the 2000s. However, while researchers were using those lasers and the HHG technique to measure ever-shorter duration light pulses, they were stymied in how to make coherent light at shorter wavelengths in the more penetrating X-ray region of the spectrum.
The new paper in Science, under lead author and senior research associate Popmintchev, demonstrates that breakthrough, showing that the understanding of the HHG process the researchers developed is broadly valid.
"We would have never found this if we hadn't sat down and thought about what happens overall during HHG, when we change the wavelength of the laser driving it, what parameters have to be changed to make it work," added Kapteyn. "The amazing thing is that the physics seem to be panning out even over a very broad range of parameters. Usually in science you find a scaling rule that prevents you from making a dramatic jump, but in this case, we were able to generate 1.6 keV -- each X-ray photon was generated from more than 5,000 infrared photons."
When the researchers first started to work with ultrafast, mid-infrared lasers just a few years ago, they actually made a step backwards and generated bright extreme-ultraviolet light of longer wavelengths than they used to achieve in the lab.
"However, we discovered a new regime that helped us to realize, just on paper, that we could make this giant step forward towards much shorter electromagnetic wavelengths and generate bright, laser-like, soft and hard X-rays," adds Popmintchev. "What the experiments were suggesting back then looked too good to be true! It seemed that Mother Nature has combined together, in the most simple and beautiful way, all the microscopic and macroscopic physics. Now, we are already at X-ray wavelengths as short as roughly 7.7 angstroms, and we do not know the limit."
To truly control the beam of photons, the researchers needed to understand the HHG process at the atomic level and how X-rays emitted from individual atoms combine to form a coherent beam of light.
That understanding combines microscopic and macroscopic models of the HHG process with the fact that those interactions occur at very high intensity in a dynamically changing medium. The development of such a conceptual understanding took the last decade to develop.
The result was the realization that there is no fundamental limit to the energy of the photons that can be generated using the HHG process. To obtain higher-energy photons, the system paradoxically begins with laser light using lower energy photons--specifically, mid-infrared lasers.
The JILA researchers demonstrated the validity of that principle in their labs in Colorado, but to achieve their breakthrough, the researchers traveled to Vienna with their beam-generating setup. There, they used a laser developed by co-author Andrius Baltuška and colleagues at the Vienna University of Technology--the world's most-intense ultrashort-pulse laser operating in the mid-infrared, with a wavelength of four microns.
"Thirty years ago, people were saying we could make a coherent X-ray source, but it would have to be an X-ray laser, and we'd need an atomic bomb as the energy source to pump it," said Deborah Jackson, the program officer who oversees the ERC's grant. "Now, we have these guys who understand the science fundamentals well enough to introduce new tricks for efficiently extracting energetic photons, pulling them out at X-ray wavelengths . . . and it's all done on a table-top!"
In addition to achieving the high energy, the increasingly broad spectrum opens a range of new applications.
"In an experiment using such a source, one energy region from the beam will correspond with one element, another with another element, and so on to simultaneously look at atoms across entire molecules, and that will allow us to see how charge moves from one part of a molecule to another as a chemical reaction is happening," adds Kapteyn. "It'll take us awhile to learn how to use this, but it's very exciting."
Last weekend's series against the Blue Jays was an important one for the Yankees, but it didn't go their way as they dropped three out of four games. Though they once held a large lead over the other teams in the AL East, the Yankees have scuffled since the trade deadline ended. When all was said and done, the only move the Yankees made was to acquire Dustin Ackley from the Mariners. Meanwhile, the Blue Jays have been on fire since they added the likes of Troy Tulowitzki and David Price, going 21-6 in August compared to the Yankees' record of 14-14. With a three-and-a-half game lead over the Yankees, the Blue Jays have now taken control of the division, which begs the question of whether the Yankees should have handled the trade deadline differently. However, the Yankees' decision to stand pat still looks like a good one, despite their slip in the standings.
When the trade deadline ended on July 31st, the Yankees had a six-game lead in the division over both the Orioles and the Blue Jays. There were plenty of trade rumors flying around as July came to a close, but the Yankees never seemed to be on the cusp of trading for any big names. This is likely due to the fact that GM Brian Cashman made it clear that he wouldn't trade certain players like Luis Severino, Greg Bird and Aaron Judge. Not long after, Severino and Bird were both promoted and so far, both of their performances have shown that the Yankees made the right call by holding onto them.
Luis Severino has made seven starts at the big league level, and looked great in the first six. He is walking more batters than the Yankees would like (4.06 BB/9), but he's also recorded 38 strikeouts in 37.2 innings. Aside from the most recent start against the Blue Jays, he's been a positive force in the rotation. Meanwhile, Greg Bird is batting .239/.311/.446 with five home runs in 26 games. Bird is even more valuable now that Mark Teixeira is out for the rest of the season with a fractured leg. The same is true of Severino, since Nathan Eovaldi may miss the rest of the year with elbow inflammation. The Yankees have been reluctant to give playing time to young guys in the past, so it's encouraging to see both Bird and Severino making the most of their opportunities to contribute.
There's no question that the injuries to Tex and Eovaldi are a detriment to the team, and if they had somehow known that those two would go down in the last weeks of the season, the Yankees might have handled the trade deadline differently. Cashman even said that he would have looked into picking up a first baseman in August if they had known about the break then, but it's doubtful that he could have found anyone better than Bird. Even if the Yankees had traded for a top starter in July, it seems like it wouldn't have made that much difference. Right now the Yankees look like they are only going to make it in the postseason if they win one of the wild cards. Would it have been worth it to trade Bird/Severino/any of the other prospects, just to make it to the unpredictable Wild Card game? Probably not. Sure, the Blue Jays made a lot of moves, but in the long run it still looks like it was better for the Yankees to avoid trading their top prospects for a short-term rental or getting saddled with a bad contract for a veteran pitcher.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending fell for the first time in a year in April after two months of solid gains, but the decline is likely temporary given a strengthening jobs market.

The Commerce Department said on Friday consumer spending dipped 0.1 percent, which was the first decline since April 2013. But the drop followed an upwardly revised 1.0 percent jump in March that was the largest gain since August 2009.
“The disappointing spending report should be viewed in the context of a stronger handoff into the second quarter,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York. “We look for ongoing labor market progress to encourage further growth in consumer spending.”
Last month's decrease, which was driven by weak spending on durable goods and utilities, did not change expectations economic growth would top a 3 percent annual pace this quarter after output shrank in the first three months of the year.
A separate report showed consumer sentiment slipped in May as households worried about income, but that too was viewed as temporary in light of the steady labor market improvement.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to 81.9 in May from 84.1 in April, but was up slightly from earlier in the month.
Another report from the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago showed factory activity in the U.S. Midwest reached its highest level in seven months in May, boosted by a surge in new orders. Order backlogs jumped to a three-year high and inventories rose for a second consecutive month.
“It provides more evidence that the economy and manufacturing are in an upswing, and points to rising employment,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
U.S. Treasury debt prices fell on the mixed data, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks were slightly lower.
INFLATION CREEPING UP
The report on consumer spending provided the latest evidence that inflation was starting to stir.
Prices rose 0.2 percent in April, pushing the year-on-year reading up to 1.6 percent - the largest gain since November 2012. It had advanced 1.1 percent in March.
Excluding food and energy, prices increased 0.2 percent. These so-called core prices were up 1.4 percent from a year ago, the biggest increase since March 2013.
The pick-up is welcome news for Federal Reserve officials, who have been worried that inflation was running so far below the central bank's 2 percent target.
Weak medical care costs has kept inflation down but that anchor is slipping away. Economists say a rise in those costs plus increasing rents should lift inflation this year and pave the way for an interest rate hike from the Fed. (Full Story)
“We believe the inflation backdrop will keep the Fed on a gradual path to normalization and look for the first rate increase in June 2015,” said Michael Gapen, an economist at Barclays in New York.
The Fed has held benchmark overnight interest rates near zero since December 2008.

ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- Bottom line is Jeff Heuerman's name won't appear as a "key addition" on any list of the Denver Broncos' offseason moves.
But when it comes to what the Broncos hope to do to improve on offense, Heuerman is at the front of the line.
This is, after all, a guy no one other than the recently retired Peyton Manning said is going to be "an awesome football player."
It's just Heuerman spent his rookie season with the Broncos on injured reserve after he tore his left ACL in May, in what was the fourth of four workouts at the team's rookie minicamp. At the time the players were in shorts and jerseys -- no helmets -- and Heuerman suffered the injury in the open field during a special teams drill.
With that, the third-round pick's season was over. Even after those four workouts, though, the Broncos already had big plans for Heuerman, and they have only ramped up those expectations after seeing his recovery.
So much so the Broncos released tight end Owen Daniels early in the offseason in their quest for some additional salary cap room.
"We're counting on [Heuerman] big time," Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said. "You look at us releasing 'OD' [Daniels] -- and you never know what can happen there down the road -- but when Jeff came in he was very impressive. We feel like Jeff can be a total tight end."
And in addition to the offensive line, the Broncos went into their offseason with the idea to upgrade their production at tight end. Kubiak has made it clear he would like to use more two-tight-end sets and more two-back sets in the season to come.
He believes the offense would be at its best with some of that power element in it and would create more match-up issues for defenses if the Broncos can balance out the formation and not have a strongside or weakside look with just one tight end.
Heuerman, a former captain for a national championship team at Ohio State, is key to that because the Broncos, and he, believe he is an every-down player.
"He's not [just] a receiver, we think he has the ability to do both [catch passes and block]," Kubiak said. "He's a very confident young man. We are counting on him a great deal and he's worked really hard. He's really been ready to go probably since a few months ago."
Manning's left foot injury was not something that was easy for the Broncos to deal with this past season -- he missed seven starts before he returned to the lineup in the third quarter of the regular-season finale -- but a benefit was what the Broncos saw from Heuerman and wide receiver Jordan Taylor in Manning's throwing sessions.
During his recovery Manning had extended throwing sessions with Taylor and Heuerman catching most of the passes. Kubiak has said he expects Heuerman to be cleared for full participation in the Broncos' offseason program, which begins April 18.
Heuerman had surgery on his left foot in the spring of 2014 and missed one game in his final season with the Buckeyes. He also injured his right ankle in the Sugar Bowl to close out his final season and took pain-killing injections to play in the national championship game against Oregon.
Kubiak has said even if the Broncos entertain the idea of bringing back Daniels with a salary-cap-friendly contract, Heuerman and Virgil Green figure to be the team's top two tight ends.
"We'll see where Owen is at down the road," Kubiak said. "He played very well for us and he played really big in some big games. I think time will tell, but obviously there were some moves made for us from a cap standpoint to get our football team in position to do some of the things that John [Elway] needed to do. Owen and I are very close and we'll see what happens."
For his part, as this past season drew to a close, Heuerman said he was trying to stay patient and "just getting ready to try to help this team win."
The Broncos will give him plenty of chances to do that.
YoYo Games‘ GameMaker Studio 2 has debuted on the Mac, enabling game developers to make two-dimensional games on macOS.
YoYo Games originally launched GameMaker Studio 2 on the PC and other platforms in March. Now it is chasing after the growing number of Mac developers to fulfill the company's goal of providing game development tools for everyone.
YoYo Games has ensured that every upgrade and feature addition made to GameMaker Studio 2 since its launch has been preserved in the macOS version. Programmers who favor the Mac operating system and Mac enthusiasts who are newcomers to the 2D-developing world can access the intuitive base of operations in GMS2.

“We worked tirelessly to ensure GameMaker Studio 2's Mac debut would coincide with the needs of game developers that prefer to use platforms outside of Windows and home consoles,” said James Cox, the general manager at YoYo Games, in a statement. “After months carefully considering the feedback we received from beta testing and direct community outreach, we're confident that developers who prefer Mac can now feasibly create games on the often ignored platform. We're always looking for ways to expand game creation to as many developers as possible, and we know Mac users will make some standout games with these resources.”
Timed with the macOS launch, GameMaker Studio 2 is also receiving a comprehensive update with new features and quality-of-life improvements. The 2.1 version update introduces changes that make game development easier.
GameMaker Studio 2 can be purchased for Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu for $100 on the YoYo Games website. To date, the GameMaker Studio family of products has been downloaded more than 10 million times since 2012 and currently has 200,000 monthly active users. YoYo Games is based in Dundee, Scotland, and it has 40 employees.
In an email, Cox said, “GameMaker Studio is a product for all levels of developer. While it has a very high skill ceiling, it goes beyond the confines of the traditional developer market. It's used in schools and is taught to, and purchased by children as young as eight years old, using the drag and drop features to quickly turn their ideas into living games. So, while the developer community is less Mac focused, across our whole market, there is much more of a mix.”
He added, “GameMaker Studio is a 2D game design platform, but what makes it different is its breadth of application. The drag and drop design features provide beginners with a way into game design without having to become coders first, so the passion that got them into game design isn't extinguished under a mountain of programming learning; that can come later. The drag and drop approach, creates real code that gives granular control, in our C based GameMaker Language (GML), to more experienced developers. For more established Indies and Studios, our workflow is what sets up apart. It's really quick to get results with GameMaker, as we remove the repetition, and they can turn their games into amazing audio-visual experiences with our advanced graphic design and sound-mixing functionality.”
Conservatives are always going on about how our government should be run like a business. Even some progressives buy into this idea, because for some strange reason, we associate businesses with efficiency, transparency, thriftiness, productivity, and accountability — even though recent years have shown that all too many businesses embody anything but these qualities. As John T. Harvey so aptly explains in his Forbes Magazine article, Why Government Should Not Be Run Like A Business:
“The problem in a nutshell, is that not everything that is profitable is of social value and not everything of social value is profitable.”
That makes sense, but not for right-wingers who still insist that our government should be run like a business. Unfortunately for all of us, business and government have grown more and more similar these days, and not in a good way. Thanks to the penny-wise, pound-foolish approach in both the private and public sectors, we all face reduced services, higher prices and taxes, long lines, labyrinthine phone trees, personnel shortages, out of stock items, lower quality goods and customer service, and a generally lower quality of life. Plus, many services that were once provided by government agencies have been handed over to the private sector. So now, we can really find out what it would be like if we ran our government like a business.
Five things that might happen if we really ran our government like a business.
Below are five examples of what life in the US would be like if conservatives had their way and we ran government like a business at the federal, state, and local levels.
(1) If we ran our government like a business: Calling 911.
If we ran government like a business, your local police department would automate calling 911 in order to save money.
You: Hello, I need to report a … um … HELLO?
Automated Phone System: Good evening. You have reached Emergency Services at Nine-One-One. For English, press one. Para espanol, oprima numero dos. If this is an emergency, please hang up, and dial Nine-One-One. Or visit our website at 911.gov.
If you're calling about a crime in progress, press one. If you're calling about your idiot neighbor cooking meth again, press two. If your house is on fire, the Fire Department is currently closed due to adjusted resource allocations. But you can press three for the Volunteer Fire Department. If nobody answers, please call Flo's Lounge at 867-5309, and ask for Bob. If you need an ambulance, press four, or repeat the previous procedure, and ask for Bob.
(2) If we ran our government like a business: Renewing your driver's license.
If we ran government like a business, the DMV would try to up-sell when you renew your driver's license.
Clerk: Good morning, how may I provide you with excellent service today?
Customer: Hi, I'm here to renew my driver's license.
Clerk: Great, how many licenses will you be renewing today?
Customer: Um … just one?
Clerk: We have a Friends Special today, if you can get two friends to renew their licenses, we'll give each of you a 30% discount on your renewal fees.
Customer: I don't have any friends.
Clerk: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. But we're also offering a three-for-two ACTION PACK deal so you can pay for two types of licenses and get one free. Most folks who come in here go for the Motorcycle and Truck Driver's licenses, along with the one they normally get for driving their car.
Customer: Wow, that sounds like fun. But I don't know how to drive a motorcycle or a truck.
Clerk: That's okay, you can add a couple of training sessions for what you normally spend on a cup of coffee every day for the rest of your life. Plus, you can't possibly drive any worse than my 90-year-old aunt who accidentally ran down a pedestrian because her foot couldn't reach the brake pedal. And we gave her a truck driver's license, though we withheld the motorcycle one.
Customer: Oh! How awful, I'm sorry to hear that!
Clerk: It wasn't so bad. He was an organ donor, and Aunt Bettie needed a new liver, so I see it as a win-win.
(3) If we ran our government like a business: Registering your child for kindergarten.
If we ran government like a business, public schools would have rewards programs and different levels of service for families, depending on how much they give to the PTA.
Parent: Hi, I'm here to register my son for kindergarten this fall, and drop off the paperwork. We're so excited!
School Administrator: Great! Hmm … okay … birth certificate, vaccination records, emergency contacts … Looks like we're all set. And will you be upgrading to Preferred Parent™?
Parent: Um, what is “Preferred Parent™?”
School Administrator: The Preferred Parent™ upgrade entitles you to exclusive benefits, like first choice for teacher conference time slots, online access to personalized progress reports for your child, and having your phone calls returned by the teacher and school administrators.
Parent: Sounds great, how do I sign up?
School Administrator: Just pledge $500 per year to our PTA and sign this waiver form.
(4) If we ran our government like a business: Getting a business license.
If we ran government like a business, they'd never have enough clerks, and the license you need would always be out of stock.
Applicant: Hello? Anybody here? Hello-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o! [waits 15 minutes for clerk to appear]
Clerk: [breathlessly] Sorry to keep you waiting. My boss just laid everyone off, including herself, so I'm the only one here. And things were crazy in the Zoning Department.
Applicant: No prob. Anyways, I'm here to apply for a restaurant license.
Clerk: Sorry, we're out of stock for restaurant licenses.
Applicant: Do you know when you'll have them again?
Clerk: I'm not sure, our rep in Bangladesh says there was another factory fire. Would you like a beauty parlor license instead?
(5) If we ran our government like a business: Declaring war.
If we ran our government like a business, we'd declare war on false pretenses and leverage the victim's enemy country's resources to finance a hostile take over … oh, wait a minute …
President: So, ya really think they got WMD's?
Vice President: Yep.
President: And they're part of the “axis of evil?”
Vice President: Yep.
President: Well, I'm the Decider, and I'm leaning towards war … but how do we pay for it?
Vice President: After we free 'em, establish a democratically-elected government, and get ‘hold of their oil, the war will pay for itself. Plus, we'll make out like bandits.
President: Okay, so we take 'em over, and then use their oil to pay for taking 'em over. Kinda like a leveraged buy-out, huh?
Vice President: Yep.
President: But what if we don't win and get stuck owing all that money?
Vice President: Then we'll just say we've got a deficit and need to cut all our government programs.
President: Wow, that's some kinda strategery ya got goin' on there. Way to go, Big Time!

Luv'd Up baby: The Scottish chart-topper, who once admitted she had never been kissed, claims she met a romantic suitor during her US tour, earlier this year
In an interview with The Sun, the Wild Horses star - who has shifted over 20 million records since finding fame on Britain's Got Talent - says she met the American doctor while staying in the same hotel.
According to reports, they enjoyed a romantic dinner and he was 'the perfect gentleman'. In fact, she insists that he now plans to visit her in West Lothian.
'It's very early days so we'll see what happens. I hope he comes over,' she said.
'I don't want to say any more about who he is right now as that would be unfair on him. All I'll say is we are around the same age and he was a very nice guy.'
Finally! Fans of Susan Boyle will be delighted to hear she's finally found love at the age of fifty-three.
Hopeful for a man: 'It's very early days so we'll see what happens. I hope he comes over,' she said.
Susan, who catapulted to worldwide fame after appearing on Britain's Got Talent in 2009, revealed last year she was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome.
In an interview with Daily Mail's weekend magazine, the Scottish star has revealed she finds talking about the condition ‘difficult'.
‘It's a very difficult subject to talk about because you always feel that eyes are on you, and people view you as different,' she explained. ‘I like to see myself as someone with a problem, but one I can solve. It is definitely getting better.
‘Since the diagnosis I've learned strategies for coping with it and the best one is always to just walk away.'
Success: Susan, who catapulted to worldwide fame after appearing on Britain's Got Talent in 2009, revealed last year she was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome
However, Susan hopes she can create a positive awareness of the syndrome.
‘I don't see my Asperger's as a disability - I see it as an opportunity for people to understand and stop prejudging,' she went on to say.
‘I hope that the awareness created will help other people to see that just because you have a diagnosis, it doesn't need to limit your opportunities in life. You can go out and achieve whatever you darn well want!'
Over the weekend I was able to tick off the last destination I definitely wanted to visit in Bulgaria: 7 Rila Lakes
I had never heard of the place before I came here, the only association I had with Rila was the monastery but turns out it is a whole mountain range south of the capital Sofia.
If you don't have a car, you might want to want to follow this plan: take the train (or bus) from Sofia to Dupnitsa, shouldn't be more than 5leva. In Dupnitsa, stay at the same station and wait for the bus to Sapareva Banya (every40 mins, takes about 20 mins), no more than 2 leva. From SB, there are only a few buses a day to Panichiste, again not more than 2 leva (if you are unlucky, you will need to take a taxi for about 12 leva). From P it is a nice hour-long walk to the lift through an old forest.
The lift costs 15 leva return and operates from 9ish am to 4.30pm (that is when the last one comes down). Alternatively, you can also hike it up, the forest will give you nice shade, though I would personally keep my strengths up for the lakes themselves (but might walk down, if I was not dependent on the public transport back to Sofia.
On top you are greeted by this building, the hut “7 Rila Lakes”, here is the link to their website (only in Bulgarian). The lakes are free of snow ONLY in July and August, during these times and on weekends I would highly recommend booking a room. The staff does not speak any English, nor do they try so I would suggest writing them an email and using Google Translate do send it in Bulgarian. The answer came promptly.
The hike itself took me 6 hours and I am fit by no means. I would classify it as moderate rather than easy, it is doable but bring loads of water and good shoes and don't forget the sunscreen, as it may be max 10C up there but there is also no shadow whatsoever. The whole experience is surreal, I still cannot believe I was there and saw all of it. I think the snow made it even more beautiful.
We arrived on a Friday, slept there and hiked on Saturday. Since it was the weekend, there were many many hundreds of people there, which was good because I could always ask for a hand, if I could not get down but at the same time, it was not much of a “me and the nature” kind of weekend. Still worth it.
We arrived back in Sofia around 8.30pm and now, 5 days later, my legs have almost stopped hurting haha. Highly recommend doing this if you are ever in Bulgaria!!
It was a great last memory for the next few months when I will be sitting indoors. However, I think I have been converted to a nature fan because I cannot wait to explore what other wonders mother nature has to offer.
