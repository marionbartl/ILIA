WITH three electric games scheduled for the MCG in the opening round, there is every chance all sorts of AFL attendance records will be smashed this weekend as the 2017 season gets underway.
If the Carlton-Richmond, Collingwood-Western Bulldogs and Essendon-Hawthorn games each attract more than 70,000 fans – and the expectation is they should – then not only would the AFL's round one attendance record of 367,792, set in 2012, be under threat, but the overall record of 371,212, set in round 15 of 2013, could be surpassed.
We reckon the fans will turn up in droves as Australia's No.1 sport returns. As episodes such as Luke Hodge's 'mystery' training absence and Jordan De Goey's bizarre broken hand episode demonstrate, don't we badly need the games to start so that we can start talking about, you know, the footy?
Anyhow, we're putting our neck on the line to project how many people will attend each game. Check back Monday morning to see how we went.
Carlton v Richmond (MCG, Thursday, 7.20pm AEDT)
Highest: 83,493 - round one, 2015*
We think: 72,000
It's a Carlton home game, which might keep a few away but if you can't be excited about going to the footy, when can you? Anecdotally, the opening game gets more than its share of neutral supporters.
Collingwood v Western Bulldogs (MCG, Friday, 7.50pm AEDT)
Highest: 67,920 - round nine, 2006
We think: 69,000
It's not the Bulldogs' flag unfurling – that takes place next week – but it is a replacement game for their members so they should rock up in big numbers. There's always early season optimism at Collingwood and their fans will turn up in droves. Add the likelihood of Travis Cloke making his Dogs debut against the Pies and this is a great piece of fixturing.
St Kilda v Melbourne (Etihad Stadium, Saturday, 4.35pm AEDT)
Highest: 40,004 - round four, 2005
We think: 35,000
Another great piece of fixturing by the AFL as it pits the two clubs considered most likely to break into the top eight this year. Saints fans are up and about at the start of every season, but particularly now after a great summer. Melbourne supporters traditionally hate Docklands, but it is a different team this year, one that appears to have set itself to snap a 14-match losing streak to the Saints. If ever they dare venture to the western side of the CBD, this is the time.
Sydney v Port Adelaide (SCG, Saturday, 4.35pm AEDT)
Highest: 41,317 - round 13, 2014
We think: 32,000
The Swans are a big draw now and optimism is high for another finish deep into September. An issue here will be the weather, which can be sketchy in Sydney at this time of year. A few showers are predicted for this twilight game. Port aren't a huge draw on the road although chairman 'Kochie' will be pleased to be able to drive to the footy.
Essendon v Hawthorn (MCG, Saturday, 7.25pm AEDT)
Highest: 61,006 – round six, 2010
We think: 85,000
The Bombers were given their choice of round one opponent and plumped for their great 1980s rivals. The banned Dons step out for the first time in 18 months, and even if you're the most casual Essendon fan – there is no excuse for missing this game. Bumping up this crowd figure even further is the fact that this is a replacement game for Hawthorn members because of the Tasmanian deal, so they'll be there in huge numbers as well, celebrating their own comeback game as new skipper Jarryd Roughead returns for the first time since 2015 after his cancer fight. Then there's Jaeger.
14 disposals in just over a quarter and now this! Jaeger O'Meara is tearing it up 🔥 #JLTSeries pic.twitter.com/eqjOcjushW — AFL (@AFL) February 26, 2017
Gold Coast v Brisbane Lions (Metricon Stadium, Saturday, 7.05pm AEST)
Highest: 16,593 – round three, 2015
We think: 16,000
It's a football fiesta at Metricon with the AFLW Grand Final kicking off the day, and if enough Brisbane Lions fans choose to stick around for the nightcap then a healthy crowd figure can be expected. Do the people of the Gold Coast understand that a potentially very good team plays on their doorstep?
North Melbourne v West Coast (Etihad Stadium, Sunday 1.10pm AEDT)
Highest: 33,151 – round 5, 2005
We think: 26,000
The 'graveyard' of time slots, but it is that time of the year where we're between junior cricket and footy seasons, so it's not that bad for families. The Kangas are up to nearly 35,000 members, so unless they're into motor racing and attend the Australian Grand Prix instead, let's hope they turn up in droves. West Coast has about 5,000 fans in Victoria who get to every game.
Adelaide v Greater Western Sydney (Adelaide Oval, Sunday, 2.50pm ACDT)
Highest: 46,737 – round 10, 2016
We think: 42,000
There won't be much away support, but the Crows can pack out Adelaide Oval on their own and despite some likely key outs for the opening game, hopes of Adelaide supporters are riding high.
Fremantle v Geelong (Domain Stadium, Sunday, 4.40pm AWST)
Highest: 38,565 – round nine, 2014
We think: 36,000
This is a great rivalry, and while serial irritant Hayden Ballantyne's absence will be keenly felt, new skipper Nat Fyfe is back – and he's fit, firing and likely to go head to head with Patrick Dangerfield for parts of the game. Going back to the days of Polly Farmer, the Cats have always had a loyal following in Western Australia.
Total crowd prediction: 413,000
* The Highest crowd is for home and away games only with the first named team as the home club.
Sore and sorry Swans
Let's not detract for a moment what a magnificent effort it was by the Western Bulldogs to win the 2016 Grand Final. It was a September (and early October) to remember and to cherish for the Dogs, while the match itself was as engrossing as they come for a flag decider.
But a bit overlooked amid all the romance was how brave the vanquished Sydney was. They were a kick from the lead until late in the final quarter, and as the subsequent stories of woe started to mount, it is becoming more evident what a great effort it was from the Swans to even get so close.
Lance Franklin entered the game with a shoulder banged up enough to require a reconstruction after the game and then he injured his ankle in the opening term. He played the game out, but was hampered.
Kurt Tippett missed an earlier final because of a fractured jaw, but had earlier missed a huge part of the season because of a serious hamstring injury. Luke Parker played the Grand Final with a PCL injury from the week before that needed post-season surgery. Dan Hannebery hurt his knee in the final quarter and tried to play the game out, but had to retreat to the bench.
Josh Kennedy was sore, Sam Naismith needed a shoulder reconstruction, Callum Mills and Jarrad McVeigh were underdone entering the Grand Final and McVeigh's calf issues are now chronic. For Tom Mitchell, who came to Hawthorn during the trade period, once the fitness staff there took a good look at him, they decided he needed to be held back from full training until after Christmas.
What does this tell us? That's eight players (that we know of) who were less than their best in the Grand Final and no doubt, there were plenty of hurting bodies on the other side as well.
The Swans have played deep into September for a few years and you can only admire that they keep fronting up year in and year out as they bash and crash their bodies for longer than most. They'll likely do so again this year.
And it probably adds further context to Hawthorn's achievement of winning three-straight flags from 2013-15 with the physical toll that took. While the Hawks would dearly have loved to have won again last year to enter the record books, what you do hear out of Waverley is how depleted they were at the end of last season. They have subsequently enjoyed both their biggest break and longest pre-season for five years.

Gabba problems laid bare
That Saturday's AFLW Grand Final needed to be moved from the Gabba because of turf issues only brought to the surface what the Lions have known for more than a decade – they really are its second-class citizens.
Talk to those at the Lions and they'll tell you plenty of stories about the Gabba staff trying to put the Lions, and by extension the AFL, back in their place.
Former Lions coach Justin Leppitsch used to have regular run-ins with notorious curator Kevin Mitchell about access to the ground even in footy season. Never mind that the cricketers are allowed to kick the Sherrin for as long and as often as they want as part of their training sessions.
But as recently as a few weeks ago, Lions media staff were shooed away from the boundary area by security staff merely for trying to take a publicity photo for the AFLW team. That explains why whenever a new player joins the Lions, the obligatory happy snap in the new polo shirt usually takes place high up in the grandstand.
And when there is cricket on, particularly the Test match that usually starts the summer, Lions admin staff usually aren't even allowed into those aforementioned grandstands to watch a few overs on their lunch break.
A caller to SEN radio the other night told of taking a guided tour of the Gabba recently, during which football and the Lions were mentioned once.
Once!
It is Mitchell who cops much of the flak, and deservedly so. But there are a few others at the Gabba who need to understand that they work for the venue, not just for one of the sports that primarily use it.

My movers and shapers
The annual industry-wide movers and shapers survey has appeared on AFL.com.au the last few days and will also appear in full in this week's edition of the AFL Record.
It is a fascinating project to compile and now in its second year, the extra twist is those who jump up the rankings and those who slide down or drop out entirely.
The survey is anonymous and drawn widely from throughout the industry, but for the sake of the exercise, here is my personal top 12.
1. Gillon McLachlan – Boss of the AFL. Nothing more to add.
2. Simon Lethlean – Brought AFLW to life and now heads up footy operations. Huge job.
3. Richard Goyder – Incoming AFL chairman. Not from Victoria, which is important.
4. Andrew Dillon – AFL chief counsel and McLachlan's main confidant and sounding board.
5. Alastair Clarkson – The best coach and a brilliant innovator.
6. Caroline Wilson – The best journo in the game. Breaks news and creates agendas.
7. Patrick Dangerfield – Who said great players don't need to walk down media street?
8. Kerry Stokes/Channel Seven – Shape so much of how we consume the game.
9. Paul Marsh – Happy players, happy game. Needs to bring the CBA home.
10. Ray Gunston – Negotiating the CBA and the AFL's investment model. Both vital.
11. Eddie McGuire – A bruising year but still commands a huge voice.
12. Rupert Murdoch/News/Herald Sun – Also play a huge role in how the game is consumed by millions.
WikiLeaks on Friday afternoon published a database of 2,060 documents it claims are emails from Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' Former Sanders campaign spokesman: Clinton staff are 'biggest a--holes in American politics' MORE's campaign chairman John Podesta.
According to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, the emails — which are labeled as “Part I of the Podesta emails” — focus on Podesta's “communications relating to nuclear energy, and media handling over donations to the Clinton Foundation from mining and nuclear interests.”

Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE and others have accused Clinton of tying the State Department's 2010 approval of a gradual Russian takeover of the U.S. company Uranium One to $145 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation.
The company was made up of land equal to about 20 percent of the U.S.'s uranium capacity, according to Oilprice.com — although experts note that the U.S. doesn't actually produce a significant amount of the world's uranium stock.
The State Department did not take unilateral action, but instead was one of a nine-agency review board, known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The Clinton campaign has maintained that the then-secretary of State was not directly involved in the process.
The State Department's Assistant Secretary of State for Economic, Energy and Business Affairs, Jose Fernandez, handled the deal, according to the campaign.
Fernandez has attested that “Secretary Clinton never intervened with me on any CFIUS matter.”
But shortly before The New York Times reported links between the donations and the sale of Uranium One, Fernandez wrote an email to Podesta, according to the WikiLeaks emails.
"John, It was good to talk to you this afternoon, and I appreciate your taking the time to call. As I mentioned, I would like to do all I can to support Secretary Clinton, and would welcome your advice and help in steering me to the right persons in the campaign,” he reportedly wrote.
In pushing back on allegations in the Times story, Assange wrote, the campaign “failed to mention that Fernandez was hardly a neutral witness in this case, considering that he had agreed with John Podesta to play a role in the Clinton campaign.”
The $145 million in donations came from nine separate donors to the Clinton Foundation, only some of whom were linked by The New York Times to Uranium One.
According to a timeline put together by the fact-checking organization Politifact, the bulk of donations occurred more than two years before the 2010 approval of the deal.
Assange has said repeatedly that his organization will release “thousands” of documents pertaining to Clinton that could have a “significant” impact on Clinton's bid for the White House.
The controversial WikiLeaks leader — who is currently avoiding a rape charge by living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London — is a vocal critic of the former secretary of State.
WikiLeaks, which published the stolen Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails earlier this year, has a policy to not disclose where it obtains the information that it makes public.
Earlier on Friday, the Intelligence Community confirmed that Russia was behind the theft of the DNC emails.
Although it remains unclear exactly who provided the documents to WikiLeaks, security experts have long warned that Russian intelligence is capable of selectively doctoring emails that it disseminates. Some have raised concerns that WikiLeaks is acting as a bullhorn for Russian intelligence.
The DNC has not denied the authenticity of any of the emails published in that leak.

MILLIKEN, Colo. -- The initial fears of residents, concerned about toxic pollution from thousands of flooded oil and gas wells across the northern Front Range, continue to be confirmed.
After Wednesday's report that a damaged oil tank had dumped more than 5,000 gallons into the S. Platte River south of Milliken, Noble Energy Thursday reported that it has found three wells that are leaking natural gas. Later, the corporation reported that another tank has released 13,566 gallons more.
In total, the state is tracking 10 oil and gas spills related to the flood, officials said.
Two wells were shut on Wednesday, but a third that appeared to be leaking a "limited" amount of gas couldn't be accessed for shutdown, according to the company.
Anadarko Petroleum Corp. reported the tank that's leaked 5,250 gallons of crude oil to the state's Department of Natural Resources, which is a required by law, on Wednesday.
"A release of oil into our rivers is of course enormously troubling," Conservation Colorado's Pete Maysmith told FOX31 Denver on Thursday. "There's the concern for fish and wildlife, not to mention the possible impact on our drinking water."
The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) says Anadarko is responding and has oil-absorbing booms in the water at a location south of Milliken and north of the confluence of the St. Vrain and S. Platte rivers.
The COGCC along with the Colorado Health Department is monitoring the cleanup of the 5,250 gallons of oil.
"I expect, as flood waters recede, we're going to see more of this kind of incidents, but they're on a scale that can be managed," said Tisha Schuler, the CEO of the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, who noted that there are millions of gallons of raw sewage in the flood waters, compared to some reported 19,000 gallons of oil.
"On a scale of the kind of flooding we're talking about, these are relatively minor impacts," she said. "That said, they're still important. And we will respond and clean them up immediately."
Residents across the northern Front Range have been concerned about possible pollution from oil and gas wells, with much of the Denver-Julesberg basin underwater.
“We probably shouldn't have had the oil and gas development in a flood plain to begin with," said Carl Erickson, with the group Weld County Air and Water. "That would have been the prudent thing.
“But, it's done now. Now we have deal with the result of having made that decision.”
2012 in review
Record: 88-74 (88-74 Pythagorean)
726 runs scored (6th in American League)
670 runs allowed (5th in AL)
Big Offseason Moves
Re-signed Anibal Sanchez. Signed Torii Hunter. Lost Jose Valverde and Delmon Young.
It has been a relatively quiet offseason for general manager Dave Dombrowski, but his two major signings made perfect sense. Bringing back Sanchez gives the team another reliable innings-eater in the middle of the rotation, even if he's not quite as good as his three terrific starts in the postseason, when he posted a 1.77 ERA.
Snapping up Hunter for two years and $26 million was one of the sleeper free-agent signings of the winter. While the Tigers ranked 25th in the majors with minus-32 defensive runs saved, the biggest defensive liability wasn't Miguel Cabrera at third base or Prince Fielder at first base, but the collection of right fielders (primarily Brennan Boesch). Hunter will be a clear defensive upgrade there, and while he won't hit .313 again (he'd never hit .300 before 2012), he'll provide more offense than the .235/.285/.357 line the Tigers got from right field in 2012 (the lowest OPS in the AL).
Position Players
The return of Victor Martinez is addition by subtraction, because it means the departure of Young and his .296 on-base percentage. Martinez is a career .303 hitter, but he is 34 and returning from missing an entire season following knee surgery.
Certainly, any lineup with Cabrera and Fielder is going to score runs; it's knowing you can build around two of the most durable players in the league (they missed only one game between them last year). Despite their presence, the Tigers ranked just 10th in the AL in home runs and they'll remain one of the slowest teams in the league. But if Martinez hits and Alex Avila hits like he did in 2011, there is potential for more runs here.
Pitching Staff
They have the best pitcher in baseball in Justin Verlander and follow that up with the underrated Doug Fister (how did the Mariners trade this guy?), Max Scherzer (fourth-best ERA in the AL in the second half) and Sanchez. Drew Smyly is one of breakout candidates for 2013, and clearly the Tigers believe so as well if the trade rumors involving Rick Porcello are true.
The question mark: Who closes? Following Valverde's meltdown in the playoffs, Phil Coke handled the position just fine, but his 4.05 career ERA and ugly .854 OPS allowed in 2012 have led to speculation that hard-throwing rookie Bruce Rondon -- with no major league experience -- will be given the chance to close. I have my doubts about that, considering Rondon has fewer than 30 innings above Class A and enough command issues (4.4 walks per nine in the minors) that Jim Leyland might want to see the kid throw some strikes before handing him the ninth. The closer issue moves the overall grade of the staff down a notch.
Heat Map to Watch
Miguel Cabrera's 44 home runs was one element of the Triple Crown. Impressively, he hit 40 of those off right-handed pitchers -- and you can see from the heat map Cabrera's ability to turn on inside pitches.
Miguel Cabrera hit 44 of Detroit's 163 home runs in 2012 -- 40 off right-handers. ESPN Stats & Information
Overall grade
Despite their World Series appearance a year ago, the Tigers were hardly a super team, top-heavy around the big three of Verlander, Cabrera and Fielder. Winning 88 games in the weak AL Central doesn't necessarily inspire a lot of confidence, but I have a feeling the rotation will be stronger after Fister and Scherzer had strong second halves, a full season of Sanchez and the full-time addition of Smyly. Hunter is big upgrade in right field as well. The Tigers will be heavy favorites once again to win the division.
The Four Types of Floorcraft 29 February 2016
Floorcraft is the art of changing your routines so that you don't crash. If you've ever been to a competition or a social dance, you know that things don't always go as planned. In more stationary dances like Cha Cha, Rumba, and Jive, you stay in your own space and nobody bothers you, but in Samba, Paso Doble, and all the Standard dances, you progress around the floor. Sometimes, you have an idea of where you want to go next - the only problem is that another couple has that same spot in mind, and there's only enough room for one of you. This is where Floorcraft comes in. At social dances, crashing isn't fun; at competitions, judges can't see your dancing if you're in a crash, so they look elsewhere.
In this article, we will discuss four great ways to use Floorcraft: Curving, Line Figures, Pivots, and Dodgers
Curving
Curving means maintaining the choreography, but adjusting the angles slightly to avoid a collision. This is the best option, because it doesn't change the routine drastically, allowing the routine to stay on phrase and not confusing the Lady by changing choreography. It is also pretty much the only option in Latin, since it is so much harder to lead changes in choreography there than it is in Standard. This is also the only option in Viennese Waltz, since there is constant progression around the floor and only have nine figures to choose from.
Let's say you are doing a Waltz Progressive Chasse to the Right, travelling down LOD. If a couple is there, travel instead DC to cut around them. In Samba, if you're dancing Criss Cross Voltas down the side or the room, curve them in either direction to go around any obstacles.
Line Figures
In Standard, if it is impossible to curve the routine around the obstacle, such as if a couple is blocked in at a corner, a great option is to do a Line Figure, such as the Contra Check, Right Lunge, or Oversway. Note that the Contra Check is a Gold figure in Waltz and Tango, and not even in the Syllabus in Foxtrot and Tango, while the Right Lunge and the Oversway are not in any Syllabus, and considered Open figures.
As dodgers, Line Figures are extremely easy. They can be done anywhere at any time, and are easy to get out of as well. They also serve to show off your frame to the judges, but beware of dancing them if you have a bad frame, because you will be showcasing something you don't want judges to focus on.
Pivots
Pivots are a very easy way for a couple to keep their space and not affect their routines too much. Nobody wants to get too close to a couple dancing Pivots, so a bubble of space is often created around them, freeing them to move after they finish. Continuous pivots are considered Open level figures, but if a couple is truly boxed in, it will be allowable to dance them even at a Syllabus level competition.
To dance them, dance four pivots in place, each making 3/4 of a turn either to the left or the right. By the end of those pivots, you will be facing the same alignment, in the same place along the floor, and be on the same beat as you were before you started, so you can continue with your routine as if nothing had happened. If the obstacle is still there, do four more pivots. Remember, if you were going to dance a Reverse figure, you should be dancing Reverse Pivots, whereas if you were going to dance a Natural figure, you should be dancing Natural Pivots.
Dodgers
Dodgers are the most difficult, and yet most elegant method of Floorcraft. When a Man uses a Dodger, he uses a figure he hadn't planned on using to avoid a collision and then return to his routine. This changes the choreography, and requires the Lady to follow something she didn't expect. This requires superb leading and following, but also extensive knowledge of figures, so the correct one can be chosen at the correct time. However, if this is done properly, nobody will be able to tell that what was danced was not the original routine, and instead it will appear that the couple was just able to weave in and out of everybody without any trouble. Here are some examples of great dodgers:

Australia 0/173 vs England 195 Match Completed CRICKET 2019 Brisbane Cricket Ground - Thursday November 23rd, 12:00 am
First Test result - match report
Australia have defeated England by 10 wickets in the first Ashes Test at the Gabba early on Day 5, after Cameron Bancroft and David Warner tracked the runs down without loss.
The Aussie openers didn't call on any of the other batsmen to help them track down the target of 170, after England were bowled out in their second innings for 195 on tea on Day 4.
From then on, the pitch was very accommodating for the batsmen, with the England fast bowlers struggling to get anything out of the surface.
Although they beat the bat of Cameron Bancroft on a couple of occasions, David Warner was at his dominant best. He made 87 from just 119 deliveries, while partner Bancroft soaked up plenty of balls for 82 from 189.

There was no joy for the England bowlers late on Day 4 or early on Day 5. That will weigh on the minds of captain Joe Root and the attack leading into the second Test match at Adelaide in just four days time.
Australia can thank captain Steve Smith for the dominant position they found themselves in after the first innings, with the captain the clear stand out. He made an unbeaten 141, with Shaun Marsh in support, making a half century. Pat Cummins provided lower-order resistance on his way to 42.
Earlier, England had scrapped to 302 for their first innings, only to crumble in the middle session of the second day to a short-pitched assault from Cummins and Starc.
It was a similar story for the tourists in the second innings, managing 195 thanks to a half century from Joe Root and a middle order partnership between Moeen Ali and Jonny Bairstow.
But the bouncer assault from Australia proved too much for the lower order to handle, and Australia were in the box seat to chase 170 runs on a Gabba pitch that seemed to get easier for the batsmen as the game went on.
England captain Joe Root, who had a scare after was struck on the head during his second innings, said the margin of victory didn't reflect the closeness of the contest.
"It is frustrating, but we have to move on quickly and make sure it doesn't happen in the next game.
"We hopefully need to start turning those starts into hundreds.
"One thing about our team is we have great character. I've got great confidence we can do that."
Australia captain and man of the match Steve Smith was pleased with the team performance, and said his hundred in the first innings was close to his best.
"I think it would be up there, particularly with the position we were in.
"I had to work really hard, I had to get off strike really well. I had to show a lot of discipline. Thankfully it worked and we got a lead."
Smith said he was pleased that
"It's pretty early - it's nice to finish quite early.
"I'm pretty pleased with the way we finished this Test match. It's a nice place to bat first.
"The way we pulled it back from the position we were in, I'm proud of the way the boys fought."

Re-live the final morning of the Test in our live updates below.
50.0 overs: Australia 0/173 - GAME OVER! AUSTRALIA wins the first Ashes Test match at the Gabba
Bancroft brings up the winning runs from Chris Woakes with a boundary straight down the ground.
He finishes on 82*, while Warner ended up on 87*.
49.0 overs: Australia 0/161 - Not far now - less than 10 to get. Australia doing it very comfortably.
KP's given his verdict:
48.0 overs: Australia 0/159 - FOUR! Warner finally gets a reprieve - they've taken one from the fence at backward square and put him at a catching position, so he takes him on and lifts it over the top for four.
Then a double over the top of slips, and a single down to fine leg. Still trying for that hundred. Pup thinks Bancroft should look at it.
"If I was Bancroft I would look at the scoreboard. Warner deserve 100 here. If I have to block every ball I'd do it."
But then he gets a two as well, basically killing off any chance.
46.0 overs: Australia 0/145 - FOUR! Edgy boundary to Bancroft basically kills any chance of a Warner century.
Edge through the slips from Ball - frustration for Root and the English side.
Australia need just 25 to win. Warner needs 23 for a ton. My early call not paying dividends here!
Joe Root into the bowling attack.
44.0 overs: Australia 0/140 - FOUR! Doing it in singles, all from the bat of Warner.
But then Bancroft finds something and wallops Ball through cover for a boundary. He moves to 60. Warner on 76.
Phillip Hughes honoured in Ashes Day 5
43.0 overs: Australia 0/134 - England employing a short-pitched assault to David Warner based on his dismissal from the first innings when he poked it to mid-wicket.
Bancroft stuck on 56, while Warner is milking singles from the short stuff backward of squad on the on side.
Not a lot in the way of real danger to the Aussie bats so far today. A couple of missed swipes by Warner and Bancroft's missed a couple of good deliveries.
41.0 overs: Australia 0/131 - I'm calling it early - with Bancroft struggling to score Warner is on 100 watch. I don't see Bancroft boshing England's attack around too much, and with Warner looking to attack the bowling of ... well... everyone, he's a chance. 39 to get and he needs 28 of them.
Big chance.
Jake Ball replaces Anderson at the other end. Root giving everyone a go.
40.0 overs: Australia 0/130 - Bancroft looking uncomfortable out there. Plenty of balls flying past his edge. He's managed a couple of prods into the outfield, and an inside edge down to fine leg.
Chris Woakes into the attack, replacing Broad after a couple of overs.
38.0 overs: Australia 0/124 - FOUR! Warner with a boundary from the first ball of Anderson's over. Then a single. Good batting.
Bancroft softened up by a bouncer, then beaten on the inside edge. Good bowling from the man with 500 Test wickets.
37.0 overs: Australia 0/119 - Warner very busy early, looking for runs at every opportunity. A couple of singles early.
Bancroft content to leave plenty of balls, make sure he's seeing them well enough. Waiting for his delivery to attack. He's beaten by Broad from the last ball of the over.
Anderson at the other end for England, showing no signs of a supposed shoulder injury.
35.0 overs: Australia 0/117 - Three for Warner, taking him to 63*. Much significance.
Pitch still playing excellently. Australia off to a good start.
10:59am: The players are out in the middle, wearing black armbands in honour of Phillip Hughes.
We await the first ball, to be bowled by Stuart Broad.
10:55am: Not far now. We're thinking with a little bit of rain lurking around, there will be no mucking around from Australia.
I think Warner and Bancroft will show plenty of intent early on and try to get celebrating after about an hour.
Hopefully they're belting their throw downs.
10:42am: Plenty of tributes flowing for Phillip Hughes today, still 63 not out. He sadly passed away three years ago.
10:30am: Welcome to our live coverage of the final day of the first Ashes Test between Australia and England.
It's more of a formality than anything else, with Australia needing to knock off 56 runs for victory.
For England, they'll be scratching their heads after a Day 4 onslaught from Australia, with both batsmen and bowlers putting them to the sword.
And then overnight there's been the breaking story of an incident between England 'keeper Jonny Bairstow and Cam Bancroft. Read about the situation here. It's an interesting one.
Day 5 preview
England have conceded Australia will take a 1-0 lead in the Ashes, after they cruised to 0-114 at stumps on day four of the series opener after being set a target of 170 in Brisbane.
David Warner and Cameron Bancroft's productive and positive start to the modest run-chase, coming a day after Steve Smith turned the match on its head with a game-changing knock of 141no, means all the hard work is done for the hosts.
Warner is 60 not out, while Bancroft is on 51. It has been almost four years since Australia enjoyed an opening stand of over 100 runs in the fourth innings of a Test.
"It was a great day," Mitchell Starc said.
"There's still a long way to go in the series but ... the first Test is huge.
"If we can knock off these 56 run tomorrow it puts us in a very strong position heading to Adelaide. England have to chase us from now on."
Starc declared he, Josh Hazlewood, and Pat Cummins would have "no issue" backing up for the second Test that starts in the South Australian capital on Saturday.
Moeen Ali, whose wounded spinning finger is among England's many concerns ahead of the day-night Test in Adelaide, admitted defeat.
"The first three days we were right in the game then today didn't quite go to plan. That's cost us this Test match," Moeen said.
"Today we let ourselves down, with the bat especially.
"We obviously won't win the game but getting wickets can sort of put a dent in Australia for the next game."
England fought hard at various junctures of a topsy-turvy Test but they were ground into submission at the Gabba on Sunday.
It started with Nathan Lyon claiming three key wickets, including Tim Paine's contentious stumping of Moeen, then gathered momentum when Starc clinically cleaned up the tail.
A shocking collapse of 4-10, the low point of which was Jonny Bairstow steering a short ball from Starc to third man in what should have been the final over of the post-lunch session, ended England's second innings of 195.
Australia were asked to achieve the highest successful run-chase in a Gabba Test since 1982.
Quick wickets would have made things interesting and Australia's openers knew it, starting cautiously before they sensed English heads dropping and started to score with ease.
Bancroft enhanced his stoic reputation, staring down Jimmy Anderson after the frustrated paceman struck the batsman's thigh with a shy at the stumps.
Starc rips through England tail
Lyon niggled the visitors publicly last week in the forthright fashion you would expect more from a leader of a pace attack.
Throughout the first Test he bowled like Australia's spearhead; nobody from either side troubled batsmen quite so consistently.
Lyon dismissed left-handers Mark Stoneman and Dawid Malan in near-identical fashion on Sunday morning, with Smith gleefully accepting two of his four catches of the innings.
Moeen, Bairstow and Joe Root scored a combined 133 runs but couldn't go on with it. Josh Hazlewood trapped Root lbw for 51 in the shadows of lunch.
Day 4 report
Australia have made huge headway in pursuit of the target of 170 to win the Ashes opener in Brisbane, after England collapsed to be all out for 195 at tea on day four.
Cameron Bancroft and David Warner both made half centuries before the close of play, but they still require 56 runs to win the first Test of the five-game series.
That should be knocked off early in the fifth morning, with fans welcome to attend the game for just a gold coin donation that will go to Movember.

Earlier, England crumbled to a short-pitched assault from Australia's pace attack and an excellent spell from spinner Nathan Lyon.
Lyon's crafty offspin, a contentious stumping and late collapse of 4-10 have now put Steve Smith's side in the box seat.
Moeen Ali provided spirited resistance to Australia's push for victory, stroking six boundaries in a knock of 40.
The allrounder became Nathan Lyon's third victim on Sunday when Tim Paine completed a sharp stumping that third umpire Chris Gaffaney agonised over.
It was a matter of millimetres but Gaffaney eventually deemed Ali's boot to be on the line; commentators and former players Ian Healy and Michael Clarke were among those who disagreed.
Smith held a sharp catch to dismiss Chris Woakes late in the session - the first of three quick wickets that Mitchell Starc claimed as he clinically cleaned up the tail.
Jonny Bairstow's uncharacteristically cautious knock of 42 ended when he steered a short ball from Starc to third man in what should have been the final over of the session.
Stuart Broad was out four balls later when Smith reviewed a caught-behind shout that the left-armer had little interest in.
170 will be the highest successful run-chase in a Gabba Test since 1982.
Lyon niggled the visitors publicly last week in the forthright fashion you would expect more from a leader of a pace attack.
Throughout the first Test he has very much bowled like Australia's spearhead; nobody from either side has troubled batsmen quite so consistently.
Lyon dismissed left-handers Mark Stoneman and Dawid Malan in near-identical fashion on Sunday morning, with Smith gleefully accepting the edges.
Josh Hazlewood claimed the all-important scalp of Joe Root for 51 in the shadows of lunch on Sunday, trapping him lbw.
They are also the canaries in the coal mine when it comes to the region's challenging housing market. If they can't afford to live here, who can?
They are the young professionals the Toronto region covets — highly educated and already earning good incomes in their 20s and 30s.
Sixty-five per cent say their shelter costs are preventing them from paying down debts.
A survey for the business group shows 83 per cent of young professionals believe high rents and home prices are impeding their ability to save for retirement.
New research from the Toronto Region Board of Trade shows the high cost of housing may be crushing the financial goals of high-achieving millennials.
"We've all grown up in a generation that says housing ownership is a good thing, it's how you create a financial future for yourself. What we're hearing from our young professionals is, that whole cost of getting into the housing market just feels really far beyond reach," she said.
De Silva says millennial workers are wondering how they will ever get ahead.
It's not a crisis yet. But it's an issue that demands attention if Toronto is to continue attracting and retaining global employers.
Young professionals are increasingly discouraged by the state and the cost of housing, said Board of Trade CEO Jan De Silva. She said that concerns from the business community about talent retention and the supply of appropriate housing for workers — rental as well as ownership housing — prompted the board to survey young professionals.
The findings come a week after new census data highlighted the Toronto region as the country's least affordable housing market, trailing even Vancouver.
The young professionals in the survey said they planned to buy a house with a 20 per cent down payment. But, on average, they had saved only 14 per cent.
"Those who are getting in are saying, 'It's just consuming so much of our available income that even trying to think about retirement savings, which is also a very responsible part of financial planning, is being impacted by this."
Fifty-two per cent of those who rented said that being unable to afford a down payment was the main reason they couldn't afford to buy.
Among the 803 survey respondents, aged 18 to 39, 42 per cent owned homes and 58 per cent were renting. Thirty-nine per cent of the homeowners lived in detached houses; 34 per cent in condos and 27 per cent lived in semi-detached or town homes.
Among the renters, 41 per cent lived in high-rise condos; 24 per cent in mid-rise buildings and 31 per cent lived in a detached, semi-detached or town houses.
A third of those surveyed said they expect help from family or friends to buy a home, with younger respondents, 18 to 29, most likely to look for that kind of assistance to buy a condo.
Sixty-seven per cent of those still renting said they expect to pay less than $750,000 for a home.
The average price of a re-sale home in the Toronto region in August was about $732,000. In September, it was $775,546, according to the Toronto Real Estate Board. The average price of a newly constructed condo was $661,188 and a new-build, detached house in the Toronto region cost $1.6 million on average last month, said the Building and Land Development Association.
The region needs to do a more robust job of collecting housing data, said De Silva. The glut of one-bedroom-plus-den condos that don't accommodate families will eventually drive millennials farther afield.
The challenge is not a foreign buyers issue, it's a supply issue, she said.
"There's a lot of international talent that's choosing to live in Toronto and we want them to be part of this community. So the (Ontario) foreign buyers' tax was just the wrong approach and there was no data to support it," she said.
The Board of Trade study included responses from among its own 1,100 young professional members, CivicAction's Emerging Leaders' Network, the Toronto Youth Cabinet and the Toronto Public Library's New Collection. The email survey by Environics took place between June and August.
Chasing the Dream
Condo shopper Seema Akram, 27, works as an assurance manager for a public accounting firm downtown. She views her future apartment as a home and an investment — one for which she has sacrificed.
Akram lived with her parents while studying at York University and, except for a brief stint working abroad, she has remained in their Markham house commuting three hours, round-trip each day to work downtown.
"When I first graduated and started to work full-time I just didn't have the money (to move out)," she said.
Now she's paid off the car she uses for client visits and she's saved a 20 per cent down payment for a condo. Her budget is $580,000 — max. The average price of a re-sale condo in the City of Toronto last month was $554,069, according to the Toronto Real Estate Board.
But all that planning and saving hasn't made house hunting easy.
"I've felt for the last two years I've been trying to chase (the market)," said Akram.
"I feel like I do have enough money to pay a sizeable down payment and get what I want. It's just the real estate market is a bit of a game with the bidding wars and so forth," she said.
"I sometimes wish that the seller would just say, 'Here's what I want, give it to me or keeping looking,'" said Akram.
She expects to spend 40 per cent of her monthly income on housing.
"It will be a little bit of a stretch but still comfortable," she said.
In exchange, Akram thinks her wish list is pretty reasonable. She wants a bedroom separated from the living room by a real door, parking and a kitchen with counter space — an island or something more than a wall of cupboards and appliances at one end of the unit's living space.
She doesn't need a balcony or a view. "I just need sunlight and I'd be happy," she said.
Akram briefly considered buying farther outside the city, but reducing her commute is a key reason for the move.
Friends who have bought homes have done it with the help of their families, she said.
"Back in the day (our parents) were able to afford a house at our age or before they turned 27 and it didn't put so much of a dent in their financial situation as it would for people today. We recognize the cost of housing has increased and it hasn't increased in proportion with people's salaries," she said.
Still, Akram likes cities. Outside of Toronto, she says she would only ever consider living in Montreal and Vancouver in Canada. She expects to stay in the city, even when, one day, she looks at moving up to a house and yard.

NEW DELHI: A third flag meeting between Indian and Chinese troops failed to break the deadlock between the two sides, with the Chinese insisting that India take down security structures in Fukche and Chumar in Ladakh without offering reciprocal commitments.
"The meeting was unsatisfactory," foreign minister Salman Khurshid told TOI, indicating that the standoff might not blow over just yet.With May Day celebrations beginning on Wednesday, Khurshid said there was no prospect of a response from the Chinese side to India's demand that the intruding troops be withdrawn. "We made our demands. But they made their demands too," Khurshid said.The Chinese demanded dismantling of the border structures that have recently come up, particularly in Fukche and Chumar. In addition, they asked the Indians to take down their tents facing the Chinese troops. Only after the Indians complied would the Chinese contemplate their next step, refusing to give any commitment on a withdrawal.According to ITBP sources, the border structures China wants India to pull down are not even permanent posts but only metal sheet shelters set up for troops who conduct frequent patrols in the desolate region prone to icy winds. Seeking their removal is a broad hint that India roll back its increased patrolling and presence in the area."Dismantling of these structures is ruled out without any clear commitment from the Chinese indicating the time of retreat of its troops from Raki Nala. There has to be complete restoration of pre-April 15 position," an ITBP official said.Indian officials were told by Chinese commanders that they would have to wait for orders from Beijing. This seems to fly in the face of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's assessment that the incident was "localized" and that the government had a plan to resolve it.It seems clear now that rather than local adventurism, a well-thought out Chinese strategy is at work that caught India off guard at a time when the government is grappling with domestic political turmoil and on the eve of a visit by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang The impasse is pushing India to take more muscular steps which would invite retaliation, a situation India is keen to avoid. But this is looking increasingly likely, sources said.Incidentally, Indian local military and ITBP commanders will be crossing over from the Indian border post at Chushul to the adjoining Spanggur post in China to participate in the ceremonial function on Wednesday to mark May Day, providing an opportunity for discussions."Informal deliberations are expected there as well, though it is now clear that this border row may not be resolved at the local commanders level," said a senior official of the security establishment.Will Khurshid still travel to Beijing on May 9? "Yes," he said, ruling out a cancellation at this stage. However, with India unable and unwilling to physically remove the Chinese tents, officials said a diplomatic approach was inevitable -- which means that both the Khurshid visit and the Chinese premier's visit to India on May 20 could be in danger.
Several years ago I had a realization. That realization wasn't sudden, or abrupt, but it was profoundly powerful. It was the realization that we as individuals are fundamentally responsible for our actions and the impact of those actions on the people around us. That realization led me to re-analyze the way I interact with people, and what type of people I choose to surround myself with.
I've come to realize that there are effectively two types of people in the world. Those who create their own luck and dismiss adversity/challenges and disappointments as part of the process, and then those who languish in their own bad luck. This latter group seem constantly plagued by bad luck, most of which can be traced back to their life choices and fixation on their own poor condition. The latter seem to always be pointing to others and claiming, “if only I had your luck, your skill, your opportunities, your good lucks, etc.” and who by that same coin refuse to create their own luck and opportunity. These ‘if only' personalities relish in creating missed opportunities and then pointing to and fixating on them as indicators of why they cannot get ahead or succeed. While this world view isn't the focus of this post, it is tied directly to an inner decision that goes hand in hand with it. So, keep it in mind as you read.
Pay It Forward
The concept is simple. When you read those three words, you probably immediately think of the movie which offered the ideology significant publicity. Ultimately, however, it's little more than an extension of the Golden Rule – that is, do onto others as you would have done onto yourself.
It's a simple approach to life, but one which is surprisingly rare. Oh, don't get me wrong, you'll find small examples of good behavior in everyone, but in many ways it has come to be an ideology at odds with our culture. Why help a stranger in a city of millions? It's part of our nature to wonder, “What's in it for me?” and of course, “What's the cost?.” The answers to these questions don't exactly give the most marketable responses. What's in it for me? The chance of a better world. The chance to help people. It's a vague answer, one which is general and initially seems insignificant. You can bring the concept of Karma into it as many do, but even then it's somewhat nebulous. The truth is that living a life which focuses on paying it forward does pay major dividends. You live a happier, healthier life and ultimately end up surrounding yourself by other people who are sincerely willing to help, for no better reason than that they can, but in truth – that is the easy part of the equation.
The second question is far more challenging: what's the cost? Most believers in a pay it forward ideology will shrug off the question, usually giving a nebulous answer that implies nothing – that there is no cost. The reality is, that there is a cost – and that cost can potentially be significant. A point I was painfully reminded of last night.
There's a reason that one of the most widely recognizable adages in our culture is, “No Good Deed Goes Unpunished”. It's not that every good deed is punished, but rather that the sting of getting burned while trying to do a good deed hurts twice as much. It's not only fundamentally hurtful but carries with it a strong sense of betrayal coupled with anger and those emotions, especially combined are incredibly powerful. So powerful in fact that they can do far more than just causing people to abandon a Pay It Forward approach to life, where they might do little more than revert to apathy and inaction. It can cause a Pay It Backwards approaches which leaves people bitter and aggressive and that's the true danger. It's also why I started this article talking about how we deal with success and obstacles in our day-to-day lives.
An Example
I mentioned earlier that the reason for this post was an altercation I had last night. Without going into too much depth I came upon a car last night around 9:30PM in a parking lot commonly used by bar goers. I was a bit early and the parking lot was largely empty. I immediately noticed that the car next to mind still had the keys in the door. I faced a dilemma. The keys were not owned by someone I knew and none of my business. They were a stranger's keys and any theft/damage done would be to a complete stranger, and the direct result of their lack of attention. Yet, if they had been my keys and a stranger noticed them – what would I hope that they might do? Ignore them and leave the car to the next, less scrupulous passer by (Keep in mind that the Phoenix area ranks in the top 10 for Automotive theft)? Or take what action was available to help.
After a moments consideration I weighed the options – would they find the keys if i put them on the front tire? The windshield? Probably not. Should I open the car door and place them on the car seat? Maybe during the day, but not at night – that would go beyond just helping and risk trespassing. The obvious option seemed to remove the keys and drop them on the ground immediately below the lock. There they'd be easily found by the owners when they searched their pockets, but wouldn't be readily visible to everyone in the parking lot. I dropped the keys, and began my way towards the bars where I was schedule to meet several friends.
I got about 15 feet before a large male (I'm 6'4/200 pounds and this guy was larger/more athletic) started shouting at me from ahead of me. I quickly explained the situation, what was going on, and encouraged the guy to calm down and talk to me. He wasn't having it. The back and forth continued for a solid minute as I backpedaled maintain my distance while he threatened me, demanded MY keys, and ignored what I was saying. I even went so far as to volunteer to call the police over, if he'd calm down, so that I could explain the situation. The threats continued, even after I could see that the Girl he was with found the keys – right where I said they'd be – and had opened the car door.
Eventually he decided threats of putting me in the hospital were insufficient, and made a leap towards me. I know when I'm outgunned – and I retreated. Quickly. He couldn't keep up, gave up shortly thereafter, turned and made a B-line back to my vehicle, which he proceeded to kick repeatedly leaving heavy scuffing on the trunk and denting in the rear passenger side door so badly that it won't open. Keep in mind, all of this has occurred AFTER I've offered to discuss the incident with the police and after the girl he was with had gained access to the car.
Still keeping my distance, I dialed 911 as soon as he headed back towards the vehicles and requested police intervention. They arrived, but not before the thug and the woman he was with got into their car and burned out of the parking lot – unfortunately – before I could close enough distance to grab a plate number.
So, what did trying to help someone get me? Very nearly a serious trip to the hospital, and at least a $500 deductible to get the damage fixed.
To Pay It Backwards?
The whole event left me feeling incredibly frustrated, angry, and disheartened. Beyond that, it left me wondering what I'd do in the future when I find myself faced with a similar dilemma. The thought do nothing of course came to mind, but it didn't stop there. What might I do in the future? After all, helping someone had just been negatively re-enforced, so why not do the opposite? Why not sheer the key off in the lock with a quick kick? Should I join countless other Arizonans and start carrying A gun? A knife?
As each of these thoughts floated through my mind over the course of the evening, I inevitably had to keep reminding myself that the cost still merited the greater benefit. That I was faced with a very clear opportunity. I could stick to my guns and remain a “shit happens” person, or I could pack it in, throw up a white flag, and retreat to the “If only”, “poor me” camp.
For my part I've chosen to stick to my guns. In the future I may think twice before deciding to go ahead and try and help someone out in a similar situation, but I'll still do it. Why? Because it's worth it. Unfortunately, discussions I've had with friends in the last 24 hours left me feeling like these types of events have led a lot of people to abandon a Pay It Forward approach to life, which is a loss for us all. I hope if you find yourself in that camp, that you'll re-consider.
At the end of the day, despite the occasional cost – it's worth it.
Baylor alum wins 4th and 5th career Grammy Awards
Congratulations are in order for Baylor graduate Giancarlo Guerrero, BM '91; the conductor of the Nashville Symphony since 2009, Guerrero won two Grammy Awards Sunday night — the fourth and fifth of his career!
The Nashville Symphony's performance of “Daugherty: Tales Of Hemingway” actually won three Grammys on Sunday: the best classical instrumental solo, the best classical compendium, and best contemporary classical composition. The first two are credited to Guerrero and cellist Zuill Bailey, while the third honor is credited solely to the piece's composer, Michael Daugherty.
[HEAR/PURCHASE “Daugherty: Tales of Hemingway” on iTunes and Spotify]
Guerrero won his first two Grammys in 2011 (almost exactly 20 years after graduating from Baylor's School of Music), earning top honors for best engineered classical album and best orchestral performance. He followed that up last year with the Grammy for best classical compendium.
Sic 'em, Giancarlo!
[Bonus note: Guerrero wasn't the only member of the Baylor family to win a Grammy last night. Baylor dad Kirk Franklin also won two Grammys on Sunday — the ninth and 10th of his career — for best gospel performance and best gospel album; his daughter, Kennedy, is a Baylor sophomore.]

We've also got Russell Hammond's weekly update of the Release Dates & Artwork section available to go along with Doogan's Queue, which means there's no excuse for missing out on the week's new releases. And as always, a portion of anything you order from Amazon after clicking through our links goes to help support our work here at The Bits and we really appreciate it.
And we've even got a new Blu-ray Disc review for you today: Tim's take on Universal and Focus Film's recent The Place Beyond the Pines. Don't miss it.
Now then… we've got some very interesting news to report today. Are any of you guys fans of the classic 1970s Battlestar Galactica TV series? If so, you'll be surprised – as we were – to learn that it's just been released on Blu-ray Disc. But as a German/Region-B only exclusive! No kidding, it came out back in early December. It's a 10-disc set, with 9 Blu-rays containing the episodes and a 10th disc (PAL format) of bonus content including much all-new material. Couple of surprises here: This is NOT a Universal release per-se. It was apparently licensed by Koch Media GmbH. The set is Region B, with both English and German audio and subtitles. Here's another surprise: The set includes not just all 24 episodes of the original Battlestar Galactica in 1080p, but also all 10 episodes of the spinoff series Galactica 1980 in 1080p too (all pillarboxed - black bars on the sides - to preserve the original 4x3 TV aspect ratio)! Reports from readers who have the set in hand say the quality is very good if not perfect – relatively on par with Universal's recent theatrical movie release, if perhaps not quite as cleaned of dust and dirt. Subtitles are removable on the episodes, but not on the extras. Here's the final surprise: I've confirmed today with Universal here in the U.S. that the studio has “no immediate plans” to release this set in the States. And indeed, the studio currently has only the DVD box set due to be re-issued in the States on 2/18 – that would have been the time to release the BD set if they'd had one planned. How do you like them apples? Bottom line: If you love this classic series, the German/Region-B BD release is your only option. That is a serious bummer… though do keep in mind that there are many good options for all-region Blu-ray players. An now Universal has just given you one more reason to get one if you haven't already. Anyway, here's the link and the cover art for the German release. Special thanks to Bits reader Rick C. for the heads-up!
Also today, it now appears that the Blu-ray 3D version of Disney's Frozen may be a Best Buy exclusive and not a Walmart exclusive as initially thought. The order page for the title on the Walmart site has disappeared and pre-orders there have apparently been cancelled. But a page for the title has suddenly appeared on Best Buy's website. Go figure. Adjust your plans accordingly.
Back tomorrow. Stay tuned…

Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar has garnered attention by being a co-sponsor of a measure to create an independent commission to probe Russia's actions. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Democratic 2020 contenders? Voters haven't heard of them There's limited time for no-name candidates to build name recognition and familiarity among voters.
President Donald Trump's poor poll numbers have dozens of Democrats reportedly considering challenging him in 2020. But voters haven't heard of the vast majority of them.
According to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll that tested voters' views of 19 potential Democratic presidential candidates — a list that includes eight senators, five governors, one congressman, a big-city mayor and a failed Senate candidate — most of the prospects are unknown among at least half the electorate.
Story Continued Below
Since the next presidential election won't start in earnest for at least 18 months, that leaves a limited time for no-name candidates to build name recognition and familiarity among voters.
"All bets are off when it comes to the composition of the 2020 Democratic primary," said Morning Consult Co-founder and Chief Research Officer Kyle Dropp. "This early polling indicates that many of the names being floated in Washington still have a lot of work to do in terms of building national profiles."
A handful of heavyweight party elders, however, would enter a campaign as known quantities: former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). At least three-quarters of voters surveyed said they had an opinion on Biden and Warren.

All will be septuagenarians come November 2020, including Sanders, who wasn't included in the name-ID battery but could decide to mount a second bid for the Democratic nomination. The poll also didn't test Martin O'Malley — another 2016 also-ran who told CBS News this week he “certainly feel[s] compelled to continue to look at” running again — but the former Maryland governor failed to gain any traction or broad name-ID during his presidential campaign.
The next tier of potential Democratic candidates are younger but little-known. Among the senators who have been mentioned as potential candidates, only Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) — the former “Saturday Night Live” writer and performer — has name identification that exceeds 70 percent. More than a third of voters, 35 percent, said they have never heard of Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) — a former governor and national party chairman who was the Democratic vice-presidential nominee last year.
Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) may be a social-media sensation, but 46 percent of voters said they have never heard of him. And four other senators — Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) —have majorities saying they have never heard of them.
Among the governors, only New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has significant name-ID; just 30 percent of voters said they have never heard of him. But that number is 50 percent or greater for Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock.
The figures are similar for a number of other potential candidates tested in the survey: Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, Walt Disney Company CEO Robert Iger and Starbucks executive chairman Howard Schultz.
It's notable that these candidates are not any better known among Democratic respondents; for all but Gillibrand and Booker, each candidate was as unknown among Democrats as among the overall pool of voters.
The poll was conducted June 8-12, surveying 1,990 registered voters. The margin of error is plus or minus 2 percentage points.
There's some evidence these candidates could be even less known than the data indicate, Dropp said.
“More than half of respondents say they've never heard of many of these potential candidates,” he said. “And, since some respondents may hesitate to admit they don't know the prospective candidates, overall awareness of the Democratic field may be even lower.”
There's still time for these Democrats to increase their name-identification — and they can look to two recent examples as potential models. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was unknown to nearly six-in-10 Americans when Gallup asked about him in June 2013, less than six months into Cruz's Senate career.
But after Cruz helped engineer a government shutdown that autumn, his name-ID jumped 20 points — though most of it added to his unfavorable rating, as Democrats and Republicans alike knocked Cruz as an opportunist who undermined the Congress for his own political gain.
Then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) also sought the White House just four years into his Senate career, but Obama's keynote address at the 2004 Democratic convention laid a foundation with the party's voters that most of the senators and governors in the poll won't have.
That leaves most of the second-tier Democrats jockeying for attention. Harris has generated headlines with her questioning of Trump administration officials from her perch on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Franken's examination of Attorney General Jeff Sessions during the then-Alabama senator's confirmation hearing won him acclaim on the left and may have helped lead to Sessions' eventual recusal from the investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 presidential election. Klobuchar, Franken's Minnesota colleague, is also on the Senate Judiciary Committee and is a co-sponsor of a measure to create an independent commission to probe Russia's actions.
Governors are equally invested in the resistance to Trump. Inslee and Cuomo quickly joined with California Gov. Jerry Brown to form a sub-national alliance after Trump announced the U.S. would pull out of the Paris Agreement on climate change; McAuliffe brought his commonwealth in days later.
But they still have work to do to become top-tier candidates in 2019. For now, the better-known prospective candidates are circumspect about whether they'll mount a bid to unseat Trump.
Warren says she is focused on winning reelection to the Senate next year. Sanders' wife said last weekend that the Vermonter hasn't made up his mind about 2020. And Biden, who declined to run last cycle after his son's death, also refuses to rule it out.
“I am an enormous respecter of fate,” Biden said this week on an interview with a public-radio station in Philadelphia. “I don't have any plans to do it, but I'm not saying I wouldn't do it.”

WebVR provides a solid technical foundation on which to build compelling VR experiences. But it does not answer a critical question, which is the topic of this post:
What could the web become in a Virtual Reality environment?
Gear VR provides a simple and straightforward answer: same same. The fundamental unit is still a page, but you use the immersion of VR to increase your effective screen size. The input constraints result in a worse experience for the user. Scrolling with your finger on your temple is tiring and head-based typing is a massive pain. Given the input constraints, we need to beef up the output and make it better matched to what VR excels at. A responsive design inspired solution would involve deconstructing the page to better suit the nature of the immersive environment.
Another approach is to make a clean break from legacy web content. What if certain web pages had parallel content tailored for virtual reality? In this post, I'll explore this idea with an example focused on Wikipedia.
Navigating the VR Forest
The web in general and Wikipedia specifically covers a vast amount of information — nearly everything. Everything is a daunting place to start, so we will begin with something specific: a forest.
To begin, navigate to a (fake) wikipedia article about a moose, and hit the VR button. This takes you to a forest meadow, with a life sized moose in front of you. You are free to move inside the forest (focus on the grass and click) and interact with other animals in it. Looking at an animal gives you some basic Wikipedia-inspired information about it. Clicking it focuses you in on it and presents options. If you leave VR when focused on an animal, you end up on the associated Wikipedia article. This closes the navigation loop: you can start from one webpage, enter VR mode, navigate to another entity inside VR, leave VR and end up on another webpage.
Try out this Wikipedia VR sample on your mobile phone in Cardboard. It also works on desktop using the spacebar to simulate the Cardboard click.
VR and education are naturally matched. As Ben explains eloquently in an I/O talk, "VR is a chance to scale experiential learning". Remembering what you learned in class is much harder than remembering your favorite vacation. In this Wikipedia example, you immediately get a sense of the animal's grandeur, which is hard to convey in words and images. You can get a feeling for quickly it runs, and what it sounds like.
Closing thoughts
Tip of the iceberg. The entities in this Wikipedia demo (in green) represent a tiny subgraph of Wikipedia:
All of the above are positioned in a much bigger subgraph of Wikipedia which might can be represented in VR. Of course, many Wikipedia pages are really difficult to imagine in VR. Could Wikipedia's Philosophy article have a compelling VR version?
Changing scale. The ability to change scale would make it possible to place every entity from the above graph into VR Wikipedia. Imagine diving into the hide of the moose, learning about symbiotic insects and hair folicles, then going deeper to learn about the structure of hair on a molecular level. Or vice versa, zooming out to look at planet Earth to see where moose live, or going into an abstract view to explore Family Cervidae. It's easy to lose an hour or two in Wikipedia's hyperlink maze. One day, it may be even easier to do this in VR.
Content is king. The big open question is how to generate this content. Even a scoped down project to VR-ify categories of Wikipedia pages (say, only forest animals), is incredibly ambitious. Where do you get all of the models? How do you animiate them to run, jump, stand around, sleep, play, eat and be eaten? How do you place them in a forest in a meaningful way? Doing this automatically seems, at a glance, AI-hard.
Limited knowledge graphs. Even if you imagine that we have a series of animated models, how do we compose them together? Do moose and canaries live in the same environment? Can you find fire ants in the bark of a Sequoia? How many? How big are hyenas, and how quickly do they run? This information is missing from even the best known knowledge graph.
3D modeling is difficult. Wikipedia's giant corpus of quality content exists because it's easy for many people to collaborate. Wikipedians need to be good writers, well versed in their topic, and motivated to contribute. There is a technical barrier - learning Wikipedia markup - but it is not incredibly difficult. For a Wikipedia in VR, the technical barriers are much higher. Even with a good collaborative editor, it seems inevitable that contributors would need to have some sense of 3D modelling, and a far more specialized skillset.
Artistic considerations. One of the challenges for a large community project like Wikipedia is establishing a consistent style. Imagine if every Wikipedia image was hand drawn. Artistic abilities vary wildly, and you can imagine a funny and chaotic result. Aaron Koblin's now classic Sheep Market experiment comes to mind:
Image caption The Nazi flags were put up near a loyalist bonfire in Carrickfergus
Nazi flags erected on lamp posts at a County Antrim housing estate have been taken down by "outraged" members of the community, a councillor has said.
They were put up near a loyalist bonfire site at the Glenfield estate, Carrickfergus, alongside paramilitary flags and the union flag.
A Confederate flag was also erected.
In a tweet, First Minister Peter Robinson wrote: "Nazi flags have nothing to do with unionism. I commend the residents who removed them."
He added: "Shameful that such flags were ever erected."
Progressive Unionist Party representative Gareth Cole condemned the Nazi flags and praised local residents for helping to take them down "very swiftly".
'Outraged'
Mr Cole told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that a member of the public called him at about 18:00 BST on Tuesday to tell him that flags had appeared in the estate a short time earlier.
"When I met the community they were all outraged, every single one and they were out on the street, disgusted at this," the councillor said.
"These flags do not represent them at all and it was them who took them down swiftly."
'Sinister elements'
Mr Cole said the bonfire was not publicly funded and added that he did not know who was responsible for erecting the Nazi and Confederate flags.
"I'm not sure who was involved, there's clearly sinister elements there that have put them up," he said.
On Tuesday evening, Alliance Party MLA Stewart Dickson said: "Clearly it's an incredibly sinister move to see any flag that has a swastika on it."
Image caption A Confederate flag was also flown at the site
"Part of the celebration for the Twelfth of July incorporates the memory of thousands of Orangemen who gave their lives during the Second World War," he said.
"For anyone to put swastika flags around a bonfire as part of their so-called celebration has taken a most sinister turn, and is flying in the face of everything that I ever understood the Orange Order to stand for."
'Utterly reprehensible'
DUP MP Sammy Wilson said such flags had "absolutely nothing in common with unionism or with loyalism".
"People from Northern Ireland fought bravely in our armed forces to defeat the Nazis and these flags should have no part in our society," he said.
"I do not believe that the vast majority of people who will participate in celebrations over the coming weekend want to see such flags flying and I welcome that they now appear to have been removed."
An Orange Order spokesman said: "The Orange Institution is not responsible for the erection of these flags in Carrickfergus.
"Public representatives, including Mr Dickson, have a role to play and should not shirk their responsibilities if there are concerns within certain communities regarding particular flags and symbols."
He later added: "Such flags are utterly reprehensible and bring shame on loyalist communities. They should be removed immediately and consigned to the dustbin of history."
Police had said they were "aware of reports of several flags in the Carrickfergus area and are making enquiries".
Go to a chain supermarket, and chances are you'll see one type of garlic—maybe two or three if you're lucky. However, there's a mouthwatering slew of Allium sativum out there, far beyond those papery white bulbs most of us encounter at the nearest Stop 'n' Shop. While most recipes don't say specifically what kind of garlic to use, once you know the basic varieties, you can start to play around and experiment with the flavors and nuances each different type brings to the table. Read on to explore the wonderful world of garlic.
Hardneck Garlic (Allium sativum ophioscorodon) tend to have more flavor than their soft-necked cousins. They're characterized by hard woody central stalks and a long flower stalk (scape) that loops and curls, usually twice. They tend to have four to twelve cloves in each bulb. That tough woody stalk in the center of the bulb tells you this is the hardneck variety. Image via Away to Garden Hardneck garlic can sometimes verge on being spicy or hot. Others say they're spicier, more complex, and altogether more "garlicky." Porcelain, Rocambole, and Purple Stripe varieties are all part of the hardneck family. Hardneck garlic tends to grow best in areas with very cold winters, since they require a longer time of vernalization (i.e., they need a long, cold winter to be dormant so they can flower in the spring). (1) Softneck garlic. Note how many more cloves it has and that it lacks the central stalk. (2) Hardneck garlic. Images via Mother Earth News If you're at a farmer's market and spot bulbs of garlic that have a rosy/violet cast to the flesh of the cloves and thinner skins, you're probably looking at hardneck garlic. Buy them right away. You want them in your life and your tummy. I use these for roasts with gamier meats, like duck or venison, as well as vinaigrettes that have other hearty ingredients, like mustard or apple cider vinegar. If you're making garlic-infused olive oil or vinegar, use a hardneck garlic if one is available for more flavor. That rosy blush under the fragile skin: that's not embarrassment, that's hardneck garlic, baby. Image via Brooklyn Supper
Softneck Garlic (Allium sativum sativum) is believed to have evolved from hardneck garlic and comprises most of the garlic you see in major supermarkets. Because it lacks the flowering scape of hardneck garlic, it produces many more cloves—sometimes as few as eight, and sometimes getting as high as thirty or more. Softneck garlic is a good all-purpose garlic that works in almost any dish. Image via Garden of Eaden If you want to eat or use garlic raw or lightly cooked, you'll probably head for a softneck variety. If you're making a simple salad dressing where garlic is a featured flavor, opt for softneck garlic. It has a more grassy, plant-like taste and doesn't have the bite of its hardneck siblings. Most processed garlic foods, like garlic powder and seasoning, come from softneck garlic. Artichoke (the strain sold in supermarkets) and Silverskin (the kind you'll most often see braided) are two varieties of softneck garlic.
Creole Garlic Originally thought to be a variety of softneck garlic, Creole garlic turns out to be in a class by itself—literally. These garlic bulbs tend to have up to 12 cloves and range from a beautiful light pink to an almost purple glow. Unlike the rosy varieties of hardneck garlics, the entire bulb itself tends to be pink/red/purple. The Ajo Morado variety of Creole garlic. Note the rich and beautiful color. Image via Agroterra Creole garlics are pretty rare and grow better in warmer climates. Creole varietals tend to have a wine reference in their name. Some types are Cuban Purple, Ajo Rojo, Burgundy, Creole Red, and Rose du Lautrec. This type of garlic tends to have some heat to its flavor and the pungency varies depending on the variety you buy. Definitely do the sniff test before you purchase—it'll tell you how much bite the garlic contains. I've only spotted this garlic a handful of times at various farmer's markets and I've always regretted not buying more.
Black Garlic Like many a superhero, the origins of black garlic are uncertain and shrouded in mystery. Scott Kim claims to have invented it. Others say it dates back to Ancient Egypt. All I know is there's lots of black garlic in Korean grocery stores (the Japanese use it, too) and that its taste is almost uncategorizable. It's recognizably garlic at first bite, but it has rich, plummy undertones as well as a hint of vinegar. It's a little chewy, like good dried fruit, and it works well when cooking for people who hate regular garlic. It can take up to a month for regular garlic to reach this stage of caramelization/fermentation. Image via Bristol Bites UK Chef Evan Hanczor of Brooklyn's Parish Hall says, "It has notes of dark caramel, chocolate, a little bitterness, a little sweetness, and umami, plus that je ne sais quoi." A combination of fermentation, dehydration, and low heat is used to get the sugars in the garlic to caramelize over a long period of time and turn black. Black garlic, according to some chefs, adds that rich, meaty umami flavor to dishes that might otherwise lack it. I've served it by itself as an appetizer or used it as a garnish on salads and meats. It also works well in sauces and vinaigrettes, but it's too expensive to use in anything large-scale, like a marinade. Some people use it in dessert, like this black garlic chocolate cake with raspberry sauce. Maria Siriano, who came up with this recipe, notes that it's most likely for adventurous eaters only.

Scapes Garlic scapes and ramps often get confused for one another, but they are two distinct varieties of greens. As mentioned above, the scape is the flowering stalk that grows in the middle of hardneck garlic bulbs. It twists and loops and often has a tear-drop shaped white bulb near its end. It's usually removed so that the plant won't produce more seeds and will instead grow a bigger garlic bulb. Culinary guru Dorie Greenspan likes to eat scapes raw or to use them as the base for a pesto. Image via Dorie Greenspan Scapes are magically delicious, especially when sautéed in butter, oil, and seasoned with a little fleur de sel. The flavor is fresh, green, and vegetal and suffused with the taste of young, fresh garlic. The texture is tender yet crisp. They're great as a side dish, steamed until tender and served in salads, or used as an accompaniment for pasta. I wouldn't use them to flavor anything, like a vinaigrette, since their flavor is so delicate. Pasta with garlic scapes and sausage. Image via Prospect the Pantry Scapes are in season during the spring and sometimes the early summer. Alas, I haven't found many places on the West Coast that sell them, since hardneck garlics thrive in colder climates, and when I do, the scapes are tougher and more fibrous. If you're a garlic lover and lucky enough to live in an area that grows scapes, buy every single bag you can when you come across them.
Ramp Ramps (Allium tricoccum) tend to have a couple of wide, spade-shaped leaves and grow from 4 to 12 inches long with tender, pale-green stems. Their flavor is like a cross between young garlic and spring onions: pungent yet sweet. They're closely related to wild garlics (Allium vineale), which is considered by many to be a weed. The bulbs of ramps are also delicious, although some chefs discard them. Image via Cantaloupe Alone Ramps, however, have been known to provoke frenzies when they appear at farmer's markets. Early spring is their best season. Like scapes, they work in just about anything, whether they're lightly sautéed and served alongside a main dish or used to create extravagantly tasty pasta.
What Kind of People Believe in Psychic Phenomena?
Are you a sheep or a goat?
The psychological profile of a typical believer in psychic phenomena is not easy to pin down—many different kinds of people believe—but there are some traits that seem prevalent.
Psychological studies of people who believe in psychic phenomena show that age and education level don't seem to matter. Political views don't seem to have any bearing. Psychologist Dr. Erlendur Haraldsson has found, however, that people who believe may be slightly more likely to support private enterprise, while those who disbelieve may lean toward state-run or cooperative enterprise.
People who search for meaning in life—who see connections rather than random or chance occurrences—may be more likely to believe. A liberal or a general interest in spirituality may make one more likely to believe in psychic phenomena. Women have a slightly higher tendency toward belief than men.
People who believe may be slightly more likely to support private enterprise.
Haraldsson conducted several studies along these lines in the 1980s and also in the early 2000s. Aspects of his findings have been confirmed by other psychologists in similar studies.
In a 1980 study to broadly test personality traits alongside psychic belief, Haraldsson found it difficult to correlate personality to belief.
He used the terms “sheep” and “goats,” which he explained are common in parapsychology to describe believers and disbelievers respectively. He wrote: “The sheep–goat variable typically was related to a mere 7 percent of the variance in the personality measures. This is part of the reason why, in both studies, prediction of sheep–goat status in a new sample proved relatively unsuccessful: personality is not a very strong predictor of whether a person is a sheep or a goat.”

Personality is not a very strong predictor of whether a person is a sheep or a goat. — Dr. Erlendur Haraldsson, professor emeritus , School of Health Sciences, Psychology Department University of Iceland.
In 1981, he looked more specifically at religious and political views. About 25 percent of the 900 people, aged 30 to 70, selected at random from Iceland's National Registry reported having had a vivid religious or spiritual experience. This figure is similar to those found in surveys in the United States and Great Britain at the time, Haraldsson noted. These people showed a higher tendency to believe in psychic phenomena.
He found a slightly positive correlation with reading the Bible, but a much more significant correlation with reading about Eastern religions. He wrote, “This may indicate that belief in psychical phenomena is related more to liberal or general religious interests than to orthodox or sectarian Christian beliefs.”
He found a slightly positive correlation with reading the Bible, but a much more significant correlation with reading about Eastern religions.
The largest correlation was with belief in life after death. He found a slightly positive correlation with frequency of dream recall and dream interpretation.
He replicated this survey a few times with slight adjustments and on a smaller scale, within the student population at the University of Iceland, and found similar results each time.
Concerning the tendency of believers to also interpret their dreams, Haraldsson speculated that the search for meaning in life may be more broadly related to belief in psychic phenomena.
“It is of interest to note that some sociologists of religion … interpret religion as a personal search for meaning—as an effort to structure reality into a meaningful universe or to build a system of meaning,” he wrote. “The labeling of an experience as ‘psychic' is frequently dependent upon an individual's assessment of events as being meaningfully connected rather than pure coincidence. On this basis, one may wonder whether a varying tendency in individuals to see or judge events as causally related or life in general as meaningful is the common source of the small but significant relationships found between religion (in a broad sense) and belief in psychic phenomena.”
The labeling of an experience as ‘psychic' is frequently dependent upon an individual's assessment of events as being meaningfully connected rather than pure coincidence. — Dr. Erlendur Haraldsson, professor emeritus , School of Health Sciences, Psychology Department University of Iceland.
In 2011, Dr. Bruce Greyson of the University of Virginia commented on a similar tendency on the part of those who believe in paranormal phenomena to search for meaning in life.
In his paper “Meaningful Coincidences and Near-Death Experiences,” published in Psychiatric Annals, Greyson stated, “Perception of coincidences and attribution of meaning to them have been associated with belief in and experience of paranormal phenomena, faith in intuitive modes of thinking, a spiritual interest, and a more experiential, rather than rational, information processing style.”
He noted, however, that it's unclear what the causal direction is here. Do believers seek meaning or does the quest for meaning inspire belief?
In 2003, Haraldsson conducted a study on children from Lebanon who persistently spoke of past-life memories. Reincarnation is a psychic phenomenon (“psychic,” though it often has associations with predicting the future, et cetera, is a term that refers to any mental phenomenon, anything relating to the human soul or mind, or something spiritual and outside of scientific knowledge). He compared the children to a test group of children who had never mentioned past lives.
He found that the children with purported past-life memories “obtained higher scores for daydreaming, attention-seeking, and dissociation, but not for social isolation and suggestibility.” However, he found “that the level of dissociation was much lower than in cases of multiple personality and not clinically relevant.”
He found that the children with purported past-life memories “obtained higher scores for daydreaming, attention-seeking, and dissociation, but not for social isolation and suggestibility.”
Children who spoke of past lives would daydream more than their peers, but there was no indication that they were more likely to fabricate imaginary experiences. Nor were they found to be more suggestible. In one of his studies in Sri Lanka, he found these children to have larger vocabularies, to obtain higher scores on a brief intelligence test, and to have better school performance than their peers.

Russia's aggressive strategy in Ukraine and its hostile attitude toward the West have forced states in the region to revise current policies toward the Kremlin's perceived “sphere of influence.” While the EU is searching for ways to avoid conflict with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Ukraine, and even though the Turkish government remains concerned over Russia's treatment of the Crimea Tatar minority in the annexed peninsula, Turkey has shown restraint. Most commentary has focused on Ankara's dependence on Russian natural gas – Turkish gas imports from Russia were estimated at 57 percent in 2013 – as the reason for Turkey's moderate approach to the Ukraine crisis. However, when describing Turkey's reticence in the former Soviet sphere, especially within Central Asia, other factors need to be considered.
In the immediate aftermath of the Soviet Union's collapse, Turkey was one of the first states to initiate wide-ranging cooperation with the Central Asian states. Despite setbacks in promoting a Turkic Union in the region, Turkish soft power over the years has achieved a moderate level of success, especially in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. In a 2012 interview with an Egyptian outlet, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu stated that Turkey's primary objectives toward Central Asian countries have been concentrated on supporting “the efforts for a working democracy and free-market economy; political and economic reform process; political and economic stability and prosperity in the region; to contribute to the emergence of an environment conducive to regional cooperation; to support their vocation toward Euro-Atlantic institutions, and to assist them to benefit from their own energy resources.”
Turkish government-funded schools in the former Soviet republics have become popular choices among prospective students. In addition to cultural links, energy security remains one of the top priorities for Ankara's strategy in Central Asia. But while Russia's gas politics are pressing both Turkey and EU to diversify their imports – even more so after the Kremlin's drive to confront the West in Ukraine – neither Turkey nor the EU can push forward with energy supply routes in Central Asia without resolving the interstate dispute over the status of the Caspian basin. This remains all the less likely after Russian adventurism in Ukraine.
Even before the crisis in Ukraine, Turkey's influence in the Turkic republics was debatable, with uneven levels of success in each state. Ankara's ties have been observably progressing in Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, while Uzbekistan and Tajikistan seem less responsive to Turkey's initiatives – though Tajikistan, as a non-Turkic nation, lacks the prior links of other Central Asian nations. The shaky Uzbek-Turkish relations took a dramatic turn after the Andijan massacre in 2005, which has provoked an international outcry. The Turkish government backed the UN resolution condemning Uzbekistan's human rights record over mass killings, resulting in a significant downturn in relations between Ankara and Tashkent. After almost a decade-long chill, Turkey's diplomatic effort to reignite relations with Uzbekistan was rewarded in July when Foreign Minister Ahmed Davutoglu visited Tashkent to jump-start relations. In Tajikistan, meanwhile, Ankara's presence in the country remains largely limited. Generally, Tajikistan is tied to the AKP's strategy regarding Turkey's assisting role with facilitating peace and stability in neighboring Afghanistan, which has been reflected in providing development aid to the Tajik government.
Despite Turkey's ill-matched political and economic capabilities – and as opposed to Beijing's massive spending spree on the regional gas pipelines and infrastructure projects, or the Kremlin's coercive actions in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan – Turkish policymakers appear to maintain a low profile that is consistent with a strategy of non-interference. Turkey had high hopes of integrating the Turkic republics into Western-oriented political-economic structures in the 1990s, but due to host of complex issues with Central Asian post-Soviet regimes, Ankara abandoned the idea of promoting democratic reforms over a focus on regional security. Turkey's political-economic power and military capabilities are not projected to support Central Asian republics as client-states – and will like continue that way, especially after China's Silk Road initiatives and Russia's revanchism in the former territories.
But relations haven't been entirely without success, and could continue in some fashion moving forward. A growing economic and domestic political shift toward the Justice and Development Party (AKP in Turkish) paved the way for Turkey's proactive foreign policy over the past decade. Turkish foreign aid to 121 countries skyrocketed from $85 million to $3.4 billion over the same period. The emergence of the AKP party has brought a pragmatic re-assessment of the Ankara's strategy in Central Asia as well. In 2009, Turkey was a robust force behind the creation of the Cooperation Council of Turkic Speaking States, an organization mainly designed to promote trade and investment among member states. And increasingly Turkish businesses have used this model of cooperation to promote Turkey to outside investors as a gateway to energy-rich, undeveloped Central Asian republics.
On the security front, hundreds of military personnel from Central Asian republics have been trained in Turkey through bilateral defense programs. The significance of Central Asia's strategic geography is one of the main priorities for Turkish policymakers in Ankara, and has spurred their decision to support security education within both the police and military, including cooperation on military modernization with Kazakhstan, funding universities both in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and a continued military presence in Afghanistan. A military agreement worth $44 million signed between leading Turkish defense company (ASELSAN) and its Kazakh partner (Kazakhstan Engineering) in 2012 resulted in the launch of the joint Turkish-Kazakh defense manufacturing in 2013. Turkey also provided $13 million in military aid to a struggling Kyrgyzstan.
Turkey does not necessarily need to approach the region in isolation. In light of the geopolitical developments in Ukraine and dramatic slowdown of the Russian economy, Turkey's balancing act in Central Asia can actually be beneficial for Moscow, which could find another partner in helping to stem some of China's swelling influence in the region. Now that the Americans have all but departed from the region, Russia's remains the only viable military hardware in Central Asia. But despite the possibilities of cooperation, Russia is unlikely to look to Ankara for aid – both due to a distrust of interacting with a NATO country, and general distaste of working with any third-party actors in what it perceives to be its backyard.
Still, even though progress can be seen in certain avenues, Turkish-Central Asian relations fall far short of their original promise. The relationship “is not really practical,” says Bakyt Beshimov, a former Kyrgyz politician and analyst of Turkish-Central Asian relations. “There's been a weakness of Turkey in strengthening its influence in Central Asia, compared to big players,” he added. Unfortunately for Turkey, the state of current relations with the former Soviet Turkic republics pales in import to Russia's military outreach or, especially, China's financial presence. And according to Beshimov, this reality will not change any time soon. ”It's about the past, not about the future,” he said. “[The relationship is] just very symbolic. It seems to me a mystification of the so-called Turkic togetherness. Even in the past, Turkic nations were happily fighting with each other.”

Over the weekend we saw a trio of iPhone 7 leaks showing the redesigned antenna lines, dual-camera module, speaker grilles, and a new 256GB storage chip. Now, HDBlog has uncovered a new set of images from Chinese web forum Baidu claiming to show schematics for both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The images show the dual-camera being exclusive to the larger model, while Smart Connector holes are nowhere to be seen.
Sylvania HomeKit Light Strip
The images show molds of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus next to one another. As you can see in the images, the dual-camera set up that has been previously reported on appears to be exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus. The 4.7-inch model, however, will still likely see camera upgrades thanks to a larger camera module.
Furthermore, holes for the Smart Connector are nowhere to be found on the larger iPhone 7 Plus. In the past, we've seen claimed images of the device with Smart Connector holes. A report from last week out of Japan claimed that the iPhone 7 didn't support the Smart Connector like previously rumored either, as did a report from earlier this month. While it's possible that the Smart Connector holes could be added at a later date, it's looking more and more likely that the initial reports that claimed the iPhone 7 Plus would support the feature were inaccurate.
This weekend a new component leak showed the dual-camera module for the iPhone 7 Plus, as well as a new 256GB storage option. That report suggested that the storage lineup would be 16GB/64GB/128GB for the Plus model this year. Additionally, another leak showed a total of four speaker grilles, much like the recent iPad Pro models. Finally, a set of images this weekend claimed to show the iPhone 7's redesigned antenna lines, screen cables, and a protruding camera.
While discussing rumors is fun, Apple is expected to officially announce the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus this fall. We'll likely see software updates unveiled at next month's WWDC, but iOS hardware announcements are generally saved for the fall. So until then, settle in for a few more months of rumors.

The casualties in the Vietnam War were pretty simple to understand. If a soldier was dead from his combat tour, he was a war casualty. There are 58,195 names recorded on the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, DC.
But something odd has happened with the Iraq War. The government, under the Bush administration, did something dishonest that resulted in a lie that's persisted since the war began — and continues to this very day. They decided to report the war deaths in Iraq only if the soldier died with his boots on the ground in a combat situation.
The actual figures have been hidden from the American public just like the returning, flag draped coffins were censored from the press. But the figures are now available and we can only hope that the American people will be outraged when they learn how they have been misled.
According to The Department of Veterans Affairs, as of May 2007, reports in the Gulf War Veterans Information System reveal these startling numbers:
Total U.S. Military Gulf War Deaths: 73,846
* Deaths amongst Deployed: 17,847
* Deaths amongst Non-Deployed: 55,999
The stastics for non-lethal injuries are likewise staggering:
Total “Undiagnosed Illness” (UDX) claims: 14,874
Total number of disability claims filed: 1,620,906
* Disability Claims amongst Deployed: 407,911
* Disability Claims amongst Non-Deployed: 1,212,995
Percentage of combat troops that filed Disability Claims 36%
I know you probably will think this is another conspiracy theory

More than 1,820 tons of radioactive nuclear waste (i.e. depleted uranium) were exploded in Iraq alone in the form of armor piercing rounds and bunker busters. This represents the worlds worst man made ecological disaster ever. 64 kg of uranium were used in the Hiroshima bomb. The U.S. Iraq Nuclear Holocaust represents far more than fourteen thousand Hiroshimas.
The nuclear waste the U.S. has exploded in the Middle East will continue killing for hundreds of years! That's how long these particles of radioactive dust will continue to blow around, get lodged in someone's lungs or be ingested. Scientists calculate that there is now enough radioactive material in Iraq to wipe out a third of the world's current population.
While we never found any WMD's (Weapons of Mass Destruction) in Iraq, we sure made up for it by importing our own! Birth defects among Iraqi newborns are up a whopping 600% from before the war. The defects are typical of the kind produced by exposure to radioactive poisons. And these injuries are happening to the civilian population of Iraq — the people we were supposedly “liberating.”

During her speech in front of the NRA, Sarah Palin threw a little red meat to the crowd by claiming that President Obama wants to take away guns and ammo, but the truth is that Obama presidency has been extremely pro-Second Amendment. Obama has been so pro-gun that the Brady Campaign gave his administration him an F on their annual report card.
Palin went with the standard claim that Obama is coming to get their guns and ammo. According to CBS News she said, “Don't doubt for a minute that, if they thought they could get away with it, they would ban guns and ban ammunition and gut the Second Amendment. It's the job of all of us at the NRA and its allies to stop them in their tracks.” The problem with this statement is that it is completely untrue.
The first splash of cold water in the face of gun control advocates came when the Obama Administration announced in April 2009 that they would not support reinstating the assault weapons ban. When asked about reinstating the ban at a White House press conference, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said, “I was asked specifically about assault weapons. I think the president would — the president believes there are other strategies we can take to enforce the laws that are already on our books.” (In case you aren't sure, Gibbs was answering no to the ban).
In January 2010, the Brady Campaign gave Obama's first year a big fat F on gun control issues. The report said, “Rather than showing leadership by calling for the stronger laws Candidate Obama had professed to support, the White House muzzled cabinet members who called for sensible gun laws. Administration officials parroted NRA slogans to just “enforce the law on the books,” even though there are few such laws and those are riddled with loopholes. It is no wonder that one pro-gun writer remarked that the NRA “should erect a statue of Barack Obama in front of its D.C. headquarters.”
The report was blunt and called Obama a failure on gun control, “On pursuing sensible solutions to the continuing tragedy of gun violence, President Obama's first year in office has been a failure. He has failed so far to live up to his campaign promises to strengthen federal gun laws and instead has signed legislation to weaken them.” (This certainly doesn't sound like the kind of president that is out to take away anyone's guns or ammo).
I would say that Sarah Palin was lying about Obama's Second Amendment record, but I don't think that she actually knows the President's record on the issue. Palin seemed to be working under the assumption that of course Obama would be against the Second Amendment, because he is a black Democrat. This episode is an example of why Palin can never be taken seriously. Facts are strictly optional with Palin.
She is more worried about delivering applause lines than the truth. We all know that in Sarah Land when the truth doesn't match her story, she simply changes the facts until it does. Palin is the poster child for the intellectual lazy stereotypical Fox News viewer. The ignorant and narrow minded adore her because she is one of them. She is everything a leader and a role model should never be, and every time that she opens her mouth the IQ of our national dialogue drops ten more points.

The High Entitlement Mind
Recently, a thirty-something daughter wanted me to evaluate her fifty-something mother for disability. She wanted her mother to leave her job at a bank. "I don't want my momma slavin' in no bank." The mother worked as a supervisor, and she seemed proud of her position. Her worst stress came from her 16-year-old grandson who was living with her. He had been expelled from school for fighting and had recently pushed her into a wall because she refused to drive him to the mall. I reflected on the young woman's formulation that going to work was "slavin'" and the significance of that term to her as an African-American. Did she feel entitled to turn her mother into free in-home supervision for her son? She had felt entitled to have a son whom she could not afford to raise. When the fatherless boy grew into a violent teenager she responded by trying to get her own mother on disability. Coincidentally, the older lady's job called her while she was in my office. She instantaneously transformed from a slumped, tearful huddle to a professional woman. She said crisply, "I have to take this," and walked out.

CDC and Texas Health Department Confirm First Ebola Case Diagnosed in the U.S.
Hospitalized patient had recently returned from West Africa; active contact tracing underway.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed today, through laboratory tests, the first case of Ebola to be diagnosed in the United States in a person who had traveled to Dallas, Texas from Liberia. The patient did not have symptoms when leaving West Africa, but developed symptoms approximately four days after arriving in the U.S. on Sept. 20.
The person fell ill on Sept. 24 and sought medical care at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas on Sept. 26. After developing symptoms consistent with Ebola, he was admitted to hospital on Sept. 28. Based on the person's travel history and symptoms, CDC recommended testing for Ebola. The medical facility isolated the patient and sent specimens for testing at CDC and at a Texas lab participating in the CDC's Laboratory Response Network. CDC and the Texas Health Department reported the laboratory test results to the medical center to inform the patient. A CDC team is being dispatched to Dallas to assist with the investigation.
“Ebola can be scary. But there's all the difference in the world between the U.S. and parts of Africa where Ebola is spreading. The United States has a strong health care system and public health professionals who will make sure this case does not threaten our communities,” said CDC Director, Dr. Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. “While it is not impossible that there could be additional cases associated with this patient in the coming weeks, I have no doubt that we will contain this.”
The ill person did not exhibit symptoms of Ebola during the flights from West Africa and CDC does not recommend that people on the same commercial airline flights undergo monitoring, as Ebola is contagious only if the person is experiencing active symptoms. The person reported developing symptoms several days after the return flight. Anyone concerned about possible exposure may call CDC-Info at 800-CDC-INFO for more information.
CDC recognizes that even a single case of Ebola diagnosed in the United States raises concerns. Knowing the possibility exists, medical and public health professionals across the country have been preparing to respond. CDC and public health officials in Texas are taking precautions to identify people who have had close personal contact with the ill person, and health care professionals have been reminded to use meticulous infection control at all times.
We do know how to stop Ebola's further spread: thorough case finding, isolation of ill people, contacting people exposed to the ill person, and further isolation of contacts if they develop symptoms. The U.S. public health and medical systems have had prior experience with sporadic cases of diseases such as Ebola. In the past decade, the United States had 5 imported cases of viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) diseases similar to Ebola (1 Marburg, 4 Lassa). None resulted in any transmission in the United States.
CDC has been anticipating and preparing for a case of Ebola in the United States. We have been:
Enhancing surveillance and laboratory testing capacity in states to detect cases
Developing guidance and tools for health departments to conduct public health investigations
Providing recommendations for healthcare infection control and other measures to prevent disease spread
Providing guidance for flight crews, Emergency Medical Services units at airports, and Customs and Border Protection officers about reporting ill travelers to CDC
Disseminating up-to-date information to the general public, international travelers, and public health partners
The data health officials have seen in the past few decades since Ebola was discovered indicate that it is not spread through casual contact or through the air. Ebola is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids of a sick person or exposure to objects such as needles that have been contaminated. The illness has an average 8-10 day incubation period (although it ranges from 2 to 21 days); CDC recommends monitoring exposed people for symptoms a complete 21 days. People are not contagious after exposure unless they develop symptoms.

Workers build levees along a river bank in North Korea, where flooding has caused significant damage in the country's northeastern province.
NEWS BRIEF Heavy flooding triggered by Typhoon Lionrock over the weekend prompted an unusual appeal for help by the government of North Korea, which called the deadly natural disaster the “the strongest storm and heaviest downpour” the country has experienced in decades.
North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency reported Sunday the governing Worker's Party called on its members and service personnel to help respond to the flooding that has caused the destruction of tens of thousands of homes, public buildings, roadways, power systems, and other critical infrastructure located primarily in the country's Northeastern Hamgyong province. At least 133 people have been killed, according to a report by the United Nation's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), and nearly 400 remain missing.
OCHA, citing North Korean government data, estimates at least 140,000 people are in need of emergency assistance, three-fourths of whom have been internally displaced.
The natural disaster prompted the government to redirect its 200-day loyalty campaign, aimed at mobilizing national support for North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, to assist those affected by the floods. Such public admissions of needing help by North Korea, however, are rare. CNN explains:
"It's not unheard of, but it's rare for the North Korean government to make an open and public call for assistance," Bradley Williams, a international relations professor at City University in Hong Kong, told CNN.
…
"Considering North Korea made this call in English, perhaps there is a distant hope that given the scale of the disaster, maybe the international community might respond," said Williams.
The news of the natural disaster follows North Korea's announcement Friday that it had successfully conducted its fifth nuclear test, which drew widespread international condemnation. Though further sanctions were threatened against the country, the North Korean government called the warnings “highly laughable.”
A suspected Boko Haram suicide bomber was shot dead by soldiers in Maiduguri after he was spotted trying to creep into the same IDP camp that nearly came under attack by a female suicide bomber who killed herself and five others on Saturday morning, officials said.
The suicide bomber was shot dead by vigilant soldiers who opened fire on him causing one of the two bombs around his body to go off.
Saturday and Sunday's incidents appear to indicate that the insurgents have made internally displaced persons, IDP, camps a major point of target.
A top leader of the Civilian-JTF, Alhaji Dan-Batta, informed PREMIUM TIMES on phone that "the male suicide bomber was seen loitering around the back perimeter fence of Bakassi camp at about 9 a.m. He was shot down before he could advance closer to the camp. One of the bombs he was carrying exploded, but another is still strapped on his body did not explode. The anti-bomb squad operatives are trying to defuse that one".
No other person was reported killed or injured from the explosion.
The incident did not cause any panic in the Borno capital as many residents were seen going about their daily businesses.
Sunday's blast came as the fifth in the series of bomb attacks around Maiduguri by the Boko Haram in the last three weeks.
Since the release of 21 of the abducted Chibok schoolgirls three weeks ago, Boko Haram insurgents have scaled up their hostility mainly using improvised explosives.
The federal government had said it will be going into another round of negotiations with the insurgents with a view to securing the release of more of the girls. Despite that, the Boko Haram have continued with their terror attacks.
Neither the military nor the police have issued any statement on Sunday's incident at the time of filing this report.
Details released under the Freedom of Information Act reportedly disclose that the aircraft stayed on the ground for five minutes before leaving.
According to its flight log, the helicopter - said to have been hired by Thames Valley Police - landed at Harrowdown Hill in Oxfordshire at 10.55am on July 18 2003, 90 minutes after Dr Kelly's body was found by search teams.
The purpose of the flight and who was on board have not been established because details of the flight log have been heavily redacted, the Daily Mail reported.
Dr Andrew Watt, who has raised doubts about the circumstances around Dr Kelly's death, told the paper: "If the purpose of the helicopter flight was innocent, one has to ask why it was kept secret."
Today Thames Valley Police declined to comment on whether the force had hired the aircraft or the reasons behind doing so and why the flight log had apparently been redacted.
A police spokesman said: "We have given, as a police force, all the evidence to the Hutton Inquiry. This was a full inquiry and there is nothing more to say."
Campaigners have been pressing for a full inquest to be held amid claims that the Hutton Inquiry into Dr Kelly's death failed to examine a number of questions surrounding the discovery of his body.
Dr Kelly's death came soon after he was named as the source of BBC reports questioning the accuracy of a Government dossier arguing the case for war in Iraq.
The Hutton Inquiry found the Government weapons inspector committed suicide in woods near his Oxfordshire home. Then Justice Secretary Lord Falconer ruled Lord Hutton's inquiry could take the place of an inquest in the coroner's court.
But a group of doctors denounced the Hutton report as a "whitewash" which "failed adequately to address the cause of death itself and the manner of death".
Attorney General Dominic Grieve is considering a dossier of evidence provided by the doctors, and is expected to announce soon whether he will ask the High Court to order an inquest.
In an open letter to David Cameron in March, the doctors warned they will seek judicial review if Mr Grieve decides no inquest is needed.
The dossier - submitted after the Attorney General requested further information about the doctors' case - highlights documents released by police, which show that no fingerprints were recovered from the knife which Dr Kelly allegedly used to slit his wrist and a pack of pills which he apparently took, or from a mobile phone, watch and water bottle found near his body.
And it highlights the fact that the lack of fingerprint evidence was not considered by the Hutton Inquiry, which they said was "insufficient" as a replacement for a normal inquest.
Tuesday afternoon Donald Trump published a statement on his campaign website which says that his comments about Judge Curiel have been “misconstrued” by the media. The full statement is here. It opens:
It is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage. I am friends with and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent. The American justice system relies on fair and impartial judges. All judges should be held to that standard. I do not feel that one's heritage makes them incapable of being impartial, but, based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case, I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial.
The following several paragraphs of the letter are devoted to making the case that the trial has been unfair and that Trump University had positive reviews from “thousands” of students. Toward the end of the statement, Trump returns to the question of Judge Curiel's impartiality:
I am fighting hard to bring jobs back to the United States. Many companies – like Ford, Nabisco, Carrier – are moving production to Mexico. Drugs and illegal immigrants are also pouring across our border. This is bad for all Americans, regardless of their heritage. Due to what I believe are unfair and mistaken rulings in this case and the Judge's reported associations with certain professional organizations, questions were raised regarding the Obama appointed Judge's impartiality. It is a fair question. I hope it is not the case.
Finally, Trump says he will not be commenting on this any further:
While this lawsuit should have been dismissed, it is now scheduled for trial in November. I do not intend to comment on this matter any further. With all of the thousands of people who have given the courses such high marks and accolades, we will win this case!
This may quell some of the discontent but there's little reason to doubt this issue will continue to be brought up by Hillary Clinton, either in ads or possibly during a debate.
What in the ass, Blues?!
Back in January, if someone stumbled up next to you on the streets of Market and Clark and said, “in four months, the Blues will be guided to a four games to one series win over the Minnesota Wild on the coattails of Jake Allen, Joel Edmundson, and Magnus Paajarvi,” you'd check them into a mental hospital and take away their copy of Twin Peaks while pouring their bottle of everclear down the drain. Sometimes, the hockey gods don't give a shit about midseason games.
Welcome to playoff hockey, where trends and rules go to die; a place where normal thinking and statistics don't matter as much. What the Blues have done the past ten days defies natural St. Louis hockey law. In dispatching Bruce Boudreau's Wild in five games, they have reversed a painful trend of April hockey and given new life to the phrase, “you never know.” Every suffering Blues fan is smiling right now, and that is all that matters.
How the fuck did this happen? It comes down to having one dominant player, some luck, and the ability to finish plays.
The Wild beat up the Blues in four of the five games of this series, smashing them into the boards and throwing everything but the kitchen sink at Allen in net, but the Blues didn't break. They beat the Blues on the face-off dot and in the penalty box, but couldn't capitalize. They outshot the Blues, but couldn't execute enough to stay out of desperation mode in Games 4 and 5.
The Wild collected 106 points during the regular season yet looked awfully human down the stretch couldn't do enough to stop a Blues team that had played great hockey for over two months. Since Mike Yeo took over behind the bench, the Blues went all Michael Corleone on the NHL.
A few words about Magnus Paajarvi, who I called the lottery winner last year, because he stayed in the lineup despite a lack of production. 2017 was a different story for the neglected speedster. Along with his seven regular season goals, Paajarvi's game winner came from being in the right place at the right time. He went to the net, and Vladimir Sobotka fed him the puck.
Same for Edmundson's game winner in Game 1, where he took a sly pass from Vladimir Tarasenko and buried the puck past Devan Dubnyk. Edmundson would go on to score another in Game 2, and put together an all around solid series that included aggressive ginger love taps, good work in the defensive zone, and some key plays late in games. The kid has come a long way since last year, where he literally assisted on an opponent goal in a playoff series.
The espresso blend of this series definitely rests on the shoulders of Allen. The kid who got a new contract, stumbled around Christmas, tripped and broke his face in January, and rose from the ashes in February. It wasn't just normal good goaltending: Jake stopped so many lethal scoring opportunities from the Wild. If he doesn't act like a boss in the first two games, this series may be over in the sad fashion. He's not just the MVP of this series; Allen is the MVP of the entire first round. Allen's faced 182 shots in five games, and stopped over 95 percent. His G.A.A. was a stubborn 1.47, and he denied the Wild many happy endings. There was a lot of head shaking when these guys were going back to the bench.
The refs couldn't even help the Wild, even if they did make a bag of bullshit calls throughout the series and appeared to have puck drop nausea in Game 4. Boudreau whined like a fat Monopoly hot tamale at several intervals of the series, but couldn't pull a Belichick and get the call overturned. The Wild had three of the five games in their own house, and lost all of them.
After guiding these green jersey wearing thugs over the Blues two years ago, Yeo was the guy turning the dials for the Note this time around, and the changes were far more than subtle. The play of Alex Steen picked once Ken Hitchcock departed, and there he was burying the second goal this afternoon and coming close to at least two others. Bringing in Yeo sent an electric shock to the entire roster of young guns and old hands on this team to cut the shit and play better hockey. The bald Zen master won't win coach of the year, but he should, because without Yeo, the Blues don't make the playoffs.
Now Nashville awaits, and they won't play nice. Pekka Rinne was as hot as Allen in helping the Predators topple the Blackhawks, and P.K. Subban brings more than a steady dose of charisma off the ice. The Predators shocked the world in round one, and will look to dispose of the Blues in round two. It was the Blues who knocked them out of the third seed in the Central Division, so there's some extra juice there.
All I know is that I was wrong about this team. Back in late January, I called this team “a fringe playoff team” at best. I didn't believe the Blues could get enough out of so many slumping players to make a legitimate run, and without Robby Fabbri, the task seemed too tall.
I was wrong about Sobotka. The freshly imported Czech scrap master scored the first goal of the series, and helped assist on the series clinching goal. He also produced his old style of hard ass play along the plays, on the penalty kill, and in the dirty areas of the ice where many players don't wish to go. While his contract extension is another Armstrong head-scratcher, I applaud #71 for making big plays.
Hat tip to Alex Pietrangelo, the fearless captain who logs more minutes than anybody. He put his foot down early in the series after a period ended, vanquished plenty of opportunities for the Wild, and represented the backbone of this team. So much of what Petro does will never be seen on a score sheet, and has to be appreciated in person. He averaged 37 shifts of hockey in the series. A true brass balls defender.
Do I think the Blues can win the Stanley Cup? No. I stand by my prediction that this team won't make it past the second round, but god damn it I'd love to be wrong. I'd love for the year where they were the least likely to succeed, the Blues would choose to kick the most ass.
Here's what they have done: given a boost to the St. Louis region and brought in more valuable dollars that will give legs to this city. The upgrades to Scottrade Center are coming, but the playoff revenue doesn't hurt a city reeling from the lost possibility of MLS Soccer and still missing NFL football. Sure, the Cardinals are playing down the street, but for the second straight year, the Blues are engaging in second round hockey action. In a year where they changed coaches and lost two key producers midseason, the Blues have kept the train moving forward. Without David Backes, the Blues have made it back. Again, what in the ass is going on?
Playoff hockey is going on, so appreciate it. As I sip my delicious cup of Tim Horton's Coffee (did you hear Game Time AM on Thursday broadcasting LIVE from Lafayette Square), I send a sneer towards the cynical minds who thought the Blues would choke away a 3-0 lead or not make it at all. I send a knowing nod to the ones who told everyone to just wait and see (hey there, Patrick Blair).
I've told you buy extra bourbon for the past two years, but tonight, I'll tell you to put it away and pour a cold frosty Budweiser instead. Perhaps a Four Hands American Pilsner or an Urban Chestnut Apotheosis brew. Table the whiskey and don't touch the champagne. There's work to do, but this feels good.
Enjoy this win. Take a couple days. Take five days. Plenty of fanbases wish they had the playoff stability of the Blues, even if the finish has never entered the building.
Right now, the Blues are riding the “you never know, so get ready” train.
Nashville, these Blues are the guy from the R-rated movie, and they have big fucking teeth and big fucking claws. They are bad men!
VLC's developers have been working on Chromecast support for some time, and it's finally available in version 3.0. That means now, you can stream video and audio files from VLC media player on your PC to your Chromecast connected to your TV.
Note: even though this feature is in the stable version of VLC, it can be finicky. Some people report it works perfectly for them, while others report it doesn't and has problems with certain types of media files. Your experience may vary, but it's worth trying to see if it works for you—and it should only get better over time.
What You'll Need
This feature is currently only available in version 3.0 of VLC for Windows and Mac, so you'll need a Windows PC or Mac and an up-to-date version of VLC to continue.
Oh, and of course you'll need a Chromecast device, or an Android TV device like the NVIDIA SHIELD (because they can accept Chromecast-standard streams, too), or a television that uses Android TV as its software (like one of Sony's newer TVs). The PC or Mac you're using to stream needs to be on the same local network as your Chromecast device, wired or wireless.
How to Cast Video From VLC
Once you've downloaded and installed the appropriate version of VLC, you can get started. First, ensure your Chromecast and your television are on.
You won't find a “Cast” icon in VLC—at least, not at the moment. To find your Chromecast, you'll need to click Playback > Renderer > Scan. If your Chromecast already appears in the menu, click on it in the list.
Open a video file in VLC and click the “Play” button. Use the Media > Open File menu or just drag and drop a video file from your file manager onto the VLC window.
After you try to play the video, you'll see an “Insecure site” prompt. Click “View certificate” to view your Chromecast's security certificate.
Click “Accept Permanently” to accept your Chromecast's certificate.
The video file should immediately begin playing on your Chromecast after you agree, with your Chromecast streaming the file from the VLC player on your computer. Use the controls in the VLC window to pause, fast forward, rewind, and otherwise control playback.
When you try streaming in the future, you'll just need to use the Playback > Render menu to scan and connect. Afterwards, you can play video files without accepting the certificate prompt again.
Again, this feature is still in development. When I tested it on my PC and SHIELD, the video was playing back with a lot of missed frames and audio de-synced by about a second. At the time of writing, pretty much any other way to play back video would be better, for example, loading local media up on a flash drive and playing it back via a smart TV or set-top box.
Help, It Didn't Work!
Having problems? This feature may just need some more time in the oven. If this VLC feature doesn't work well for you at the moment, try another way to watch local video files on your Chromecast.
Specifically, there's an easy way to stream your computer's desktop video to a Chromecast using Google Chrome's built-in casting tool. To start it, open Chrome to any website, then click the Chromecast icon, or click the Menu button and click “cast.”
Select the drop-down menu next to “Cast to,” then change the source from the Chrome tab to “Cast Desktop.” Then select your Chromecast or Android TV device.
Once Chromecast is broadcasting the whole screen, just open VLC and play your video in fullscreen. Note that, because Chromecast's video streaming protocol is focused on speed rather than quality, the video quality will be much lower than in the steps above.
If you'd like to downgrade back to a stable version of VLC, visit VLC's homepage, download the current stable build, and install it.
Talk about getting ‘twisted.'
For the first time ever, a major player in the wine, beer and spirits industry is set to link up with the rapidly expanding cannabis market, as the company that brews the popular Mexican brand beer Corona has just claimed its own stake in the marijuana green rush.
Two Worlds Collide
Constellation Brands, which also distills Svedka vodka, just invested a whopping $191 million in the Canadian-based cannabis company Canopy Growth Corporation.
The chunk of change is good for a 10 percent stake in the marijuana corporation, but the deal comes with an option for Constellation to purchase an additional ownership interest in Canopy in the future.
Since the acquisition, Constellation shares increased almost one percent during premarket trading.
The move is viewed as a risk by some, considering cannabis is still illegal on a federal scale. Constellation remains the only alcohol-business to take said risk, but chief executive Rob Sands told the Wall Street Journal that it's a calculated move and believes he now has a leg up on his competition.
“We're obviously trying to get first-mover advantage,” Sands said.
Sands also added that he thinks it's only a matter of time before cannabis is legalized on a federal level.
”We think that it's highly likely, given what's happened at the state level,” Sands said.
While just eight states (Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Washington) and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational cannabis, there are 22 other states that have legalized medical marijuana, and that number is expected to grow. Canopy Growth happens to be the biggest licensed producer of medical marijuana in Canada, with a valuation of C$2.2 billion.
Canada is also set to legalize recreational cannabis by July 18, which bodes well for the Canada-based company. Edibles and cannabis-infused beverages are projected to be legalized the following year, which would seemingly set up a large payout for Constellation.
Corona Invests In The Marijuana Green Rush
Despite cannabis' increasing legality in the United States, Constellation says it doesn't anticipate selling its products in the U.S. until the plant is legalized on both a state and federal level.
Regardless of U.S. policy, there is still significant profitability to be had in Canada alone.
Many pre-existing drug companies currently utilize the plant in their medications, and a Canadian index of marijuana stocks, calculated by research house Canaccord Genuity, indicates cannabis stocks have risen as much as 36 percent over the past month.
According to analysts, a short-term option for Constellation could be developing non-alcoholic, cannabis-infused beverages to be sold only in Canada upon legalization. It has been estimated that this untapped market alone could be worth around $5- $10 billion.
Eight Capital analyst Daniel Pearlstein believes the investment will have a significant impact on a variety of industries, including alcohol, tobacco and pharmaceutical companies.
“This move is a complete game changer, not only for Canopy but also for the entire industry,” Pearlstein said.
A Pew Research Center survey finds that evangelical Christians believe it's becoming harder to be an evangelical Christian in society.
I think I can speak for the rest of society when I say, “Cry me a goddamn river.”
Two years ago, 34% of evangelicals thought it was hard being them. That number has now gone up to 41%. (In case you're wondering, non-religious Americans and Catholics saw virtually no change over the past two years when asked if it's harder being them.)
Pew's Michael Lipka offers this possible explanation for why evangelicals feel this way:
Some of this feeling may stem from the fact that the country is becoming more secular: A rising share of Americans do not identify with any religion, while a shrinking portion of the population is Christian. Another factor may be the spread of legal same-sex marriage nationwide and increasing social acceptance of homosexuality, developments with which many conservative Christians disagree. And other clashes with the values many conservative Christians hold continue to play out across the country, whether it be over the teaching of evolution in public schools, the presence of religious displays on public property for Christmas or whether public school cheerleaders can put Bible verses on their banners.
To look at this information another way, it's not harder to be an evangelical Christian. They still have their churches. They're still in the majority. They still walk the halls of Congress. They still have political candidates pandering to them.
What's changed is that the rest of us refuse to be silent when their abhorrent beliefs cross the line into public policy. When they try to force their views on the rest of us — whether it's opposing LGBT rights, promoting Christianity through schools and government, or ruining science education — we're going to fight back. They're welcome to believe in bullshit, and no one's going to stop them from celebrating their ignorance every week in church.
But our society is diverse enough and organized enough to finally push back against the Christian majority when we have to.
The only reason evangelicals think it's more difficult to be themselves is because, for a long time, no one challenged them on their ideas. It's happening more regularly now — and it's a good thing, too. The facts just don't back up the things they then to say about abortion, civil rights, science, and non-religious people — not to mention Jesus, miracles, and Hell.
We need to make it even more difficult for them. No one's stopping them from being Christians, but people with bad ideas should feel like everyone is against them. It means the better ideas, backed up by reason and evidence, are winning out.

The Standard Quantum Limit is imposed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, in which the measurement itself perturbs the motion of the oscillator, a phenomenon known as “quantum back-action.” (Image by Kevin Gutowski)
A team of researchers led by Dan Stamper-Kurn of UC Berkeley have announced that they have measured the smallest amount of force to date. Using a combination of lasers and optical trapping, they were able to detect 42 yoctonewtons. One yoctonewton is a septillionth (1/1024) of a Newton. Though scientists once believed the standard quantum limit (SQL) would be reached about 30 years ago, previous measurements within recent years have only come within a factor of 6-8 above SQL. These results come just a factor of 4 greater than the SQL. The team's paper was published in Science.
“We applied an external force to the center-of-mass motion of an ultracold atom cloud in a high-finesse optical cavity and measured the resulting motion optically,” Stamper-Kurn said in a press release. “When the driving force was resonant with the cloud's oscillation frequency, we achieved a sensitivity that is consistent with theoretical predictions and only a factor of four above the Standard Quantum Limit, the most sensitive measurement that can be made.”
The SQL is brought about by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which essentially states that two complimentary measurements (force and motion, in this case) can only get so precise without negatively affecting one another. In measuring the force optically, the equipment used will get to a point where they are perturbed more by the act of measuring than by the object it is supposed to be recording, due to “quantum back-action.” The SQL is the most precise measurement of quantum force that can be taken before measurements are skewed.
The team used an mechanical oscillator created by two standing-wave light fields at slightly different wavelengths in order to optically trap a cloud of only 1,200 rubidium atoms. After the cloud was brought down near absolute zero, one of the light waves creates a force on the cloud by slightly altering the wave's amplitude. A laser probe is then able to measure the infinitesimal amount of force.
“When we apply an external force to our oscillator it is like hitting a pendulum with a bat then measuring the reaction,” explained lead author Sydney Schreppler. “A key to our sensitivity and approaching the SQL is our ability to decouple the rubidium atoms from their environment and maintain their cold temperature. The laser light we use to trap our atoms isolates them from external environmental noise but does not heat them, so they can remain cold and still enough to allow us to approach the limits of sensitivity when we apply a force.”
By using colder atoms and more advanced optical equipment, the researchers are confident that they can detect forces even closer to SQL. There are also different techniques that can be tried in order to avoid the quantum back-action that creates noise when measuring force. Advances on this front could also lead to improved atomic force microscopy.
Danielle LaPorte is a creative force of nature.
If she deems something worthy, it'll happen. Doesn't matter how many have tried before. Or how many people tell her it's not possible. That's their truth, not hers.
Along the way, she's taken a high-school degree and gone toe-to-toe with Ivy League Ph.Ds at a Washington think tank. She launched her own branding firm, wrote the bestselling book The Firestarter Sessions, based on her experience “lighting up” hundreds of entrepreneurs.
She's spoken around the world in front of audiences of thousands, creating what's often described as soulfully transcendent moments. More recently, she's given birth to The Desire Map. And rumor has it, there's even a new magazine set to launch in 2014. Yes, a real, live paper magazine.
In this week's episode of Good Life Project, we explore this remarkable journey. We look at what fuels LaPorte, how she feels about traditional education, bureaucracy, serving others and building businesses and careers as an outgrowth of the fiber of your being. We get into why anyone would want to launch a print magazine when the world is going digital and what's going to be in it ( she even drops an impromptu tag line, fair warning, nsfw).
We also talk about major challenges. Danielle gets very real, very fast. She's not afraid to call things the way she sees them, including the bumps and triumphs along her own path. So much wisdom along the way!

Everyone has their own relationship to and tolerance for alcohol, but next time you're at a party, you might do well if you have exactly two drinks. If you are a person who has found that zero drinks, or one drink, is the right number for you, then that is the number to stick with. For everyone else, try two.
Here “party” means anything bigger than an intimate group of family or friends. If people are gathering and drinking alcohol, and those people include people you don't really know, or people you don't really like, or especially people you have to work with (see previous two categories)—at a party like this, it is a good idea to consume, in the course of the event, two alcoholic beverages.
Advertisement
Does this seem low? It's not, really. Having two drinks—specifically, one drink, and then later on another drink—is moderate social drinking. It will probably make you a little more relaxed and easygoing. It is unlikely, however, to leave you sloppy or belligerent. You will not be the life of the party. Being the life of the party is usually a mistake, especially around people you don't like and/or have to work with.
How do you go about drinking only two drinks in the course of a party? First, have one drink. Make it something you enjoy drinking, but also something you know that you're drinking, so you don't thoughtlessly rush through it. If you're slurping down a delicious fruity alcoholic beverage because it's delicious and fruity, you'd be better off having a delicious nonalcoholic smoothie.
The current craze for ostentatiously bitter IPAs can be helpful here. The idea that bitterness is the signature of sophisticated beer is obnoxious and false, but bitterness can be a feature of some good beers, and if you enjoy a bitter beer, it encourages you to sip your way through the bottle. You may be only halfway down when your friend or not-really-friend drains their own first beer and offers to go get everybody some more. “Thanks,” you say, “I'm still good with this one.”

The same result can be achieved by slowly sipping a glass of bourbon or scotch. Taste it. Savor it. Let other people rush to the bottom of their drinks, if they must.
What about the old college maxim, “Liquor, then beer, never fear; beer, then liquor, never sicker”? It doesn't matter, because you're only having two drinks.
Eventually you will get to the bottom of your first drink, because you are not not-drinking. Now is the time to get something else: a nice, refreshing glass of seltzer. Maybe a bracing cup of cranberry juice. Maybe cranberry and seltzer together. The sort of people who pay attention to what other people are drinking may notice and say something. No one owes these people any sort of explanation, but you may hoist your beverage half an inch or so and smile and say, “Pacing myself.” That is what you are doing, in fact: You are pacing yourself.
Advertisement
The truth is, even if you are setting out to drink six or eight drinks (a bad idea), you should follow your first drink with a hydrating, nonalcoholic beverage. Everyone at a party is better off with a little fluid in the system.
By the time you reach the end of your nonalcoholic drink, some of the people around you will be on their third drinks, maybe even their fourth. They may be saying things that are indiscreet. Rather than taking this as an invitation to say something indiscreet yourself, you may take it as a reminder of the value of discretion. Or, if you wish, you can say something that seems indiscreet but is carefully considered. You are under control.
Now that you have fallen completely off the pace, have another drink. Again, choose something you enjoy. Savor it. If you accidentally find yourself in possession of a drink you don't really like—a flavored Uncanny Valley simulacrum of a beer, for instance—get rid of it at once and replace it with something you do like.
Advertisement
At this point, the people who are on their way to getting good and drunk will have lost count of your drinks, if not their own. They will see you and your drink, and you will register as one of them. Your drink will slowly warm you up, and you will feel convivial; you are one of them. Just not a sloppy or reckless one.
Nor will you be desperate to join them in the line to go to the toilet. You're well hydrated but not sloshing.
Enjoy your drink. Chat with the people you want to chat with. You will find it surprisingly easy to maneuver around the bores and troublemakers. If shots appear, do not take any. This may require a little resolve, but you will have plenty of resolves. You're not going to lose an argument with a drunk.
Advertisement
Eventually your second drink, like all good things, will come to its end. If you were having three or more drinks, a third drink would seem like a good idea. But you are having two drinks. Look around. Is this party still a place you want to be? If it is, get another seltzer or juice, or go outside and hang out with the smokers. If it is not—when it is not—say your polite goodbyes to people who are still capable of listening, get your stuff, and go. It is not your job to sustain a thinning party.
Venture out into the night. Feel the noise and stimulation of the party lift from you, leaving you clear-headed and alert. Go home and get a good night's sleep. You're not missing anything.
As an anti-immigration protest outside a Red Deer, Alta., high school wrapped up Tuesday, RCMP Const. Derek Turner looked over to see a friendly soccer match underway in the schoolyard.
The Syrian and Canadian players, integrated as a community, were apparently unaffected by race.
Turner and his partner went over to play goaltender for either team.
As the protest wrapped up Syrian, non-Syrian students & <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RCMP?src=hash">#RCMP</a> joined in for an impromptu soccer game 'This is what our school is all about' <a href="https://t.co/4Fh6TrqLb7">pic.twitter.com/4Fh6TrqLb7</a> —@andreahuncar
"I thought that was a really good show of support for the school and for the kids," he said Tuesday.
More than 40 people were outside Lindsay Thurber Comprehensive High School in response to a fight involving Syrian and Canadian students.
A video of the fight was posted to social media this past week, and rumours swirled about whether the Canadian children involved were treated unfairly as compared to the Syrians.
Officials from Lindsay Thurber posted a statement Friday, refuting claims that the Syrian students were spared any discipline.
Students heading to school Tuesday fresh off the Victoria Day long weekend were greeted by the protesters. One Canadian-born Grade 11 student, Ursella Khan, felt the need to address them.

She said Canada needs to work harder to help newcomers feel more comfortable.
"If we don't help, then what are we doing as a country?" she told reporters Tuesday, while the protesters demanded she answer questions about Saudi Arabia and the Qur'an.
Providing the facts
With the rumours about the fight still running rampant Tuesday, the principal of the high school felt he needed to clear the air with his students.
"We began the day today with every one of our teachers speaking in their classes and, first of all, providing the facts," Dan Lower said, to ensure every student knew what was rumour and what was true.

His next steps were to address any resulting concerns from the student body.
"I got word that there were kids who were outraged that this was being said and wanted to go and, you know, protest the protesters," he said.
"I asked them not to do that. Just spread the truth of our school: be polite, be respectful, as we ask everyone to be."
He also said the safety of the students was his main concern, and that staff will be taking suggestions and fielding questions from students over the coming days.
Khan spoke about the importance of integration between Canadians and Syrians. The Grade 11 student included herself among those who have to do better.
"They're not integrating with Canadian kids," she said. "We do need to work better in helping them."

But just hours after she expressed her frustration with the lack of integration, Canadian and Syrian kids did just that — by playing a friendly game of soccer over the school lunch hour.
Turner said the response by the children speaks volumes about the school and students.
"They believe in what the school means to them," Turner said. "I think we've got a lot to learn from our kids."
SPOKANE, Wash. Gonzaga University will review its weapons policy as two students who used a pistol to scare off an intruder appeal their probation for having guns in their university-owned apartment.
Executive Vice President Earl Martin said Monday the university will try to turn the incident into a teachable moment by re-examining its no-weapons policy.
"We will consider the scope of the policy, but always guided by what is in the best interest of student safety," Martin said. He could not predict how long the process may take.
Bans on firearms in university-owned buildings and residences are common across the country, Martin said.
Gonzaga, a Jesuit university known for its basketball program, is a school of about 8,000 students near downtown Spokane.
Students Erik Fagan, 21, and Daniel McIntosh, 23, were informed by the university over the weekend they were on probation and could be suspended or expelled for any more violations of the university's code of conduct, The Spokesman-Review reported.
Their lawyer, Dean Chuang, said Gonzaga should consider student safety above all else.
"We're glad that it didn't have to end in tragedy for them to consider changing the policy there," Chuang said. "Our boys were armed and stopped a home invasion here."
A homeless man came to their door Oct. 24 demanding money and trying to force his way inside.
Fagan said he offered the man a blanket and a can of food but refused to hand over any cash. The man became agitated and combative, he told the newspaper.
Fagan shouted for McIntosh, who came downstairs holding a loaded 10 mm Glock pistol.
"I draw on him," McIntosh said. "As soon as he sees me, he decides he doesn't want to deal with me. So he takes off."
The men called police and campus security. Fagan has a concealed weapon permit, he said.
Campus security returned the next day and confiscated McIntosh's pistol and Fagan's shotgun, which he uses for hunting and sport shooting.
The men say their guns were seized illegally and are seeking to have them returned.
They say they are glad they weren't expelled but they're appealing their probation because they don't want the sanction on their school records.
Students are not allowed to have guns in their homes if they live on campus or in a university-owned apartment. The university discipline board on Friday found Fagan and McIntosh responsible for two violations: possessing weapons on school grounds and putting others in danger by the use of weapons.
The man who went to their door, John M. Taylor, 29, is a six-time felon, said police spokeswoman Monique Cotton. His crimes have included riot with a deadly weapon, possession of a controlled substance and unlawful imprisonment.
Officers responding to an initial report of a residential burglary found him in the area, Cotton said. He was jailed on an arrest warrant from the state Department of Corrections, she said. Typically that means a person under department supervision has violated terms of release. Taylor was no longer on the jail roster Monday.
Department of Corrections spokesman Chad Lewis said records were not available Monday because of the Veterans Day holiday, so he couldn't speak about Taylor. Arrest warrants are commonly issued when people fail to report to a supervisor or for treatment.
There was no answer Monday at the Spokane County public defender's office, which might represent Taylor.
John Podesta and Hillary Clinton in North Las Vegas, Nevada, on Oct. 19. Carlos Barria/Reuters
Earlier Monday, 10 of the 538 electors set to meet on Dec. 19 to certify Donald Trump's election as president released a letter to Obama's Director of National Intelligence (James Clapper) asking to be briefed about the reported conclusion of American intelligence officials that Russia sabotaged Hillary Clinton via email leaks in order to increase Trump's chances of winning. John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman and himself one of the targets of a purportedly Russian hack, has now issued a statement on behalf of the Clinton campaign supporting the call for a briefing:
Here's the full Podesta statement pic.twitter.com/2mTRq2tFpZ — Gabriel Debenedetti (@gdebenedetti) December 12, 2016
Before this move, the Clinton campaign hadn't done anything else to support the long-shot legal or public-pressure campaigns to overturn November's results via the Electoral College, and it doesn't seem at all possible that she could be installed in the presidency via an electors' revolt without triggering an unprecedented constitutional crisis. The most high-profile faithless-elector campaign, the Hamilton Project, calls for the selection not of Clinton but of a compromise candidate like John Kasich or John McCain. (One of the Clapper letter's signatories, Michael Baca of Colorado, is a co-founder of the Hamilton Project. Another, Chris Suprun of Texas, has written that he will not vote for Trump.) Meanwhile, even some Clinton supporters are already arguing that her involvement in the issue constitutes an unhelpfully partisan subversion of democratic norms. Does Hillary Clinton genuinely think the intelligence community's conclusions about Russian sabotage might justify the selection of someone other than Donald Trump as president? If so, it would seem to eventually be incumbent on her to make that claim publicly—and to say who this hypothetical other president should be.
To remaster of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim will debut in October 2016 and now the Best Buy store has announced that it will have an exclusive version of the game that includes a Dovahkiin mask.
That is, if you buy the Dragonborn bundle of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim The Special Edition, which is priced at $75 USD, you get a Dovahkiin mask and a physical copy of the game in a Steelbook collection. You should know that the mask is made of fabric, but still it looks great.
For now, the pack is exclusive to Best Buy, and is available for Xbox One and PlayStation 4. You can pre-order your copy on this page.
To remaster of Skyrim, which was announced at E3 2016, features improved and new visual effects, new snow shaders, improved lighting and more. This version will be free on PC for those who have all the DLC of this game.
Moreover, the version for Xbox One will support mods in the same way that happened with Fallout 4. This feature will not be available on PlayStation 4 because it seems that Sony does not agree with this choice.
Bethesda has not yet confirmed details about the technical issues, but Digital Foundry is convinced that Skyrim Special Edition on PS4 and Xbox One will offer full 1080p at 30 frames per second.
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim The Special Edition will debut on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC on October 28.
Sometimes when I do research I come across something so spectacular I have to sit and wonder why we most of the world is crammed into a tiny fraction of the earth's land mass. I had that feeling when I walked through Longwood Gardens during the Winter of 09. It was a cold crisp day but I felt the warmth of nature all around me. The treehouses, the fields and streams were inspiring and the botanical indoor gardens were beyond anything I could imagine. But I diverge, Alnwick Gardens is in the spotlight today. The treehouse(s) on the premises is well not easily describe because to do so would not do justice to what the experience of being there really is, but I will try.
Alnwick Garden Treehouse is the world's largest, all-wood treehouse. It is six thousand square feet. It's comprised of walkways, cottages, shops, a restaurant, and play areas. It holds close to one thousand people. More than thirty lime trees support the structure.
The main building sits on a plat-form of yellow balau hardwood decking. Freeform sketches were used rather than CAD architectural renderings. Which is possibly the reason it has such an organic feel. Ok those are the facts.

About the National Jukebox
The Library of Congress presents the National Jukebox, which makes historical sound recordings available to the public free of charge. The Jukebox includes recordings from the extraordinary collections of the Library of Congress Packard Campus for Audio Visual Conservation and other contributing libraries and archives. Recordings in the Jukebox were issued on record labels now owned by Sony Music Entertainment, which has granted the Library of Congress a gratis license to stream acoustical recordings.
At launch, the Jukebox includes more than 10,000 recordings made by the Victor Talking Machine Company between 1901 and 1925. Jukebox content will be increased regularly, with additional Victor recordings and acoustically recorded titles made by other Sony-owned U.S. labels, including Columbia, OKeh, and others.
Acoustical Recording
Pictured here is an acoustic recording session conducted in the era before microphones were utilized for recording. Music and speech were funneled through recording horns, which in turn vibrated an attached diaphragm and stylus, thus etching the sound waves onto a rotating wax disc.

Richard Dawkins speaks to The Irish Times (screen grab)
The recent cancellation of a book event with Richard Dawkins by the radio station KPFA has caused reverberations around the world. KPFA cited offensive remarks Dawkins has made about Islam. Dawkins and his followers have claimed these were taken out of context and that he's been equally critical of Christianity. What this controversy misses, however, is the far greater destructive force of other ideas Dawkins has promulgated over decades, which have helped form the foundation of a mainstream worldview that endorses gaping wealth inequalities and encourages the wanton destruction of the natural world.
Richard Dawkins is seen as a superhero by rationalist thinkers seeking to overturn the delusions of monotheistic thought, which have wreaked havoc on the experience of billions of people over the past two millennia. In a 2013 poll, the readers of a respected British magazine, Prospect, voted him as the world's top thinker. His bestselling popularization of evolution, The Selfish Gene, published in 1976, was recently named the most influential science book of all time in a Royal Society poll.
In fighting for science against religious superstition and climate deniers, Richard Dawkins deserves some of his popular acclaim. However, rational as they appear at first, Dawkins' ideas are based on delusions of their own. The flaws implicit in his own belief system may be less obvious than those of monotheism, but they are at the root of much that is wrong in the current mainstream worldview. Important as it is to point out the dangerous delusions of monotheism, it is equally important not to replace one set of misconceptions with another.
In my book, The Patterning Instinct, I explored the underlying misconceptions that have led to our current crisis of civilization, and realized that Dawkins has been popularizing two of the most pernicious. One is the idea that all living organisms are controlled by selfish genes, and that humans, by implication, are innately selfish. Another is the notion that nature is nothing more than a very complicated machine. Both of these core ideas have been shown by countless scientists to be fundamentally wrong. Yet, partly because of the popularity of Dawkins's own writing, they are widely taken on faith by the same intelligentsia that reject the fallacies of monotheism—and are used to justify some of our civilization's most destructive behaviors.
The ‘Selfish Gene' Is Bad Science and Bad Economics
Since Dawkins's 1976 publication of The Selfish Gene, millions of people have come to understand evolution as the result of genes competing against other in a remorseless drive to replicate themselves. Ruthless competition is seen as the force that separates evolution's winners from losers. Even altruism is interpreted as a sophisticated form of selfish behavior used by an organism to propagate its own genes more effectively. “Let us try to teach generosity and altruism,” Dawkins suggests, “because we are born selfish.”
It's a harsh story, and one that has become a bedrock of modern economics, which argues that human beings are motivated by their own self-interest, and their collective self-serving actions result in the best outcome for society. This has led to a commonly accepted pseudo-scientific rationalization for laissez-faire capitalism, using the misappropriated term “survival of the fittest” to justify ruthless exploitation of the poor by wealthy corporations.
It is, however, a story that has been shown in recent decades to be erroneous at each level of its narration. Dawkins's idea of the “selfish gene,” while still holding currency in the popular imagination, has been extensively discredited as a simplistic interpretation of evolution. In its place, biologists have developed a far more sophisticated view of evolution as a series of complex, interlocking systems, where the gene, organism, community, species, and environment all interact with each other intricately over different time frames.
Rather than a battleground of “selfish genes” competing to outperform one another, modern biologists offer a new view of nature as a web of networked systems, dynamically optimizing at different levels of evolutionary selection. Ecosystems rely for their health on the tightly synchronized interaction of many different species. Trees in a forest have been discovered to communicate with each other in a complex network that maintains their collective health—sometimes referred to as the “wood wide web.” And regarding our intrinsic human nature, a new generation of scientists has pointed to our ability to cooperate, rather than compete, as our defining characteristic.
As distinguished biologist Lynn Margulis put it, “Life did not take over the world by combat but by networking.” In direct contrast to the “selfish gene” rationalization of laissez-faire capitalism, the recognition that cooperative networking is an essential part of sustainable ecosystems can inspire new ways to structure technology and social organization for human flourishing.
The ‘Nature as A Machine' Delusion
Ever since the 17th-century scientific revolution, the view of nature as a complicated machine, first proffered by Hobbes and Descartes, has spread worldwide, leading people to lose sight of it as a metaphor and wrongly believe that nature actually is a machine.
Richard Dawkins has been responsible for popularizing an updated version of this Cartesian myth, writing famously that “life is just bytes and bytes and bytes of digital information,” adding: “That is not a metaphor, it is the plain truth. It couldn't be any plainer if it were raining floppy discs.” Open any science magazine, and you'll see genes described as programmers that “code” for certain traits, while the mind is discussed as “software” for the “hardware” of the body that is “wired” in certain ways. Thanks to Dawkins and his followers, this deluded view of nature as a machine has become ubiquitous, creating the moral sanction for corporations to treat the earth as a resource to plunder, beguiling techno-visionaries to seek immortality by downloading their minds, and inspiring technocrats to argue for solving climate change through geoengineering.
Biologists, however, identify principles intrinsic to life that categorically differentiate it from even the most complicated machine. Living organisms cannot be split, like a computer, between hardware and software. A neuron's biophysical makeup is intrinsically linked to its computations: the information doesn't exist separately from its material construction.
In recent decades, systems thinkers have transformed our understanding of life, showing it to be a self-organized, self-regenerating complex that extends like a fractal at ever-increasing scale, from a single cell to the global system of life on Earth. Everything in the natural world is dynamic rather than static, and biological phenomena can't be predicted with precision.
This new conception of life leads us to recognize the intrinsic interdependency of all living systems, including humans. It offers us the underpinnings for a sustainable future where technology is used, not to ransack nature or re-engineer it, but to harmonize with it and thus make life more meaningful and enhance flourishing.
The Reductionist Myth and the False Choice It Offers Us
Richard Dawkins and his followers have been responsible for foisting a cruel myth on thinking people around the world: that if they reject the illusions of monotheism, their only serious alternative is to believe in a world that is harsh, selfish, and ultimately without meaning. Their ideas arise from a particular form of scientific thought known as reductionism, which holds that every aspect of our world, no matter how awe-inspiring, is “nothing but” the mechanical motion of particles acting predictably on each other.
In fact, recent findings in complexity theory and systems biology point the way to a new conception of a connected universe that is both scientifically rigorous and deeply meaningful. In this understanding, the connections between things are frequently more important than the things themselves. By emphasizing the underlying principles that apply to all living things, this understanding helps us realize our intrinsic interdependence with all nature, and offers a philosophical basis for a future of sustainable flourishing. Rather than driven by selfish genes in an endless struggle, we are in fact part of a web of meaning linking humanity with the natural world.
The damage that Richard Dawkins has caused our global society goes far deeper than any hurtful comments he has made about Islam. As we face the gaping inequalities caused by uncontrolled capitalism, along with the looming threat of catastrophic climate change and other impending global crises, we must recognize the role that Dawkins' ideas have played in forming the philosophical foundations of our unsustainable worldview.
Ultimately, the crucial issue is not about cancelling his appearance on a radio show but recognizing that, just as religion has caused millennia of suffering based on delusional ideas, Dawkins himself has created a new delusional framework offering a false rationale for an economic and technocratic system destroying human and natural flourishing. The choice is not between religion and science, as Dawkins and his followers suggest. The real choice is between a flawed worldview that leads inexorably to globally destructive behavior and one that recognizes life's deep interconnectedness and humanity's intrinsic responsibility within it.

A factory in a Bangladesh building that collapsed Wednesday, killing more than 190 people, produced clothes for the popular Canadian clothing retailer Joe Fresh and various international brands.
By Thursday morning, junior minister for Home Affairs Shamsul Haque said that a total of 2,000 people had been rescued from the wreckage of the collapsed eight-storey building.
Brig. Gen. Mohammed Siddiqul Alam Shikder, who is overseeing army rescue teams, told The Associated Press the death toll had climbed to 194 as of Thursday afternoon.
Workers at the Rana Plaza, just outside the capital city of Dhaka, said large cracks were visible in the building's structure ahead of the collapse, but a factory manager told them it was safe to go inside.
Shortly afterward, the structure caved in.
"No shaking, no indication. It just collapsed on us,” 25-year-old worker Sumi told The Associated Press.
After a photo of a Joe Fresh label amid the rubble made the rounds online, the brand's parent company, Loblaws Inc., released a statement.
“We are extremely saddened to learn of the collapse of a building complex in Bangladesh and our condolences go out to those affected by this tragedy,” the company said.
“The large complex, housing a commercial bank and shopping mall, also included a factory that produced a small number of Joe Fresh apparel items for Loblaws Inc. We will be working with our vendor to understand how we may be able to assist them during this time.”
Last November, a fire at Bangladesh's Tazreen garment factory killed more than 100 people, drawing attention to poor working conditions in the country's textile industry.
International workers' rights groups have been critical of Western companies that use poorly maintained factories in Bangladesh and elsewhere to cheaply manufacture their merchandise.
Loblaws said Wednesday it requires its vendors to meet certain requirements “to ensure that products are being manufactured in a socially responsible way.”
The company's standards specifically prohibit child harassment or abuse and forced labour, Loblaws said. “Fair pay” and health and safety regulations are also enforced, it said.
“We audit against these standards on a regular basis.”
The building complex also housed businesses that make clothing for The Children's Place and Benetton, among other brands.

Last year, GO-JEK introduced the “tipping” feature for GO-PAY bookings during the Ramadan season as a way to elevate the platform and emphasize our commitment to providing others with the ability to “pay it forward”.
The feature was so popular and heavily used by our users that it remains an in-app feature even today!
Typically, about 1 in 5 bookings elect to leave their driver a tip through the app via GO-PAY. This statistic was very consistent over the past year. However, during this year's Ramadan season, 1 in 4 bookings distributed a tip to their driver! This adds up to an average additional income of Rp 400.000.000 per day ($30,030) for our active driver fleet. People were choosing to be more generous more often in the spirit of Ramadan!
GO-TIX Donation Events
This year, the GO-TIX team partnered with several charitable causes to empower our users with the ability to donate generously. Over 3,000 GO-JEK users contributed more than Rp 100.000.000 ($7,900) through GO-TIX to charities such as Rumah Zakat, Yayasan Sayangi Tunas Cilik mitra Save The Children Indonesia, WeCare.id, and SOS Children's Village during this year's Ramadan (as of June 20th 2017). In comparison to last year's Ramadan donations, this is an increase of more than 60%!
A New Way To Send THR
The ‘THR' (Tunjangan Hari Raya) tradition of gifting friends and family money during or after Ramadan is a common way to celebrate these special days with our Muslim friends. This year, we discovered that many people were using the Transfer feature through GO-PAY as a way to gift THR to their friends and family! By comparing this year's Transfer activity from April 29th to May 19th (pre-Ramadan) versus May 27th to June 16th (during Ramadan), we found a 25.7% increase in the amount of money being transferred. These people also sent messages of well-wishes along with their Transfer gifts — take a look at some of the words that were most commonly used during this Ramadan season (words translated from Indonesian):
We were pleased to see that people were using their digital GO-PAY wallet as an easy way to share the holiday spirit. Words related to the Ramadan season increased significantly such as “THR”, “break”, and “fasting”. However, what was most interesting to the team were the phrases whose usage in Transfers decreased the most during the Ramadan season below:
You can quickly see that words suggestive of snacks or meals saw the greatest drop in frequency — at reductions between 20% to 40%. What this means is that on an average day, GO-PAY is often used to treat friends and family to a midday snack or meal — but during this fasting season, people are much more likely to use GO-PAY Transfer as a way to celebrate and share the gifts of Ramadan.
As mentioned in our article about LUMi's reveal, there's an interview series of five interviews. While we knew the first interview would be of her illustrator, Fugin Miyama, we didn't know when the interview would be released, but it's finally out now! The interview reveals LUMi's design as well as previous concept art.
The Concept
This interview talks about designing LUMi as well as her basic character concept. It includes character illustrator Fugin Miyama as well as AVA Yoshizawa Kaoru. Yoshizawa Kaoru was LUMi's planner and designer.
The “Feeling” of LUMi
According to this first interview, LUMI's representative keywords are: “Buddhism,” “Jellyfish,” “Shrine Maiden,” and “Kamakura.”
LUMi's view of the world is based on Buddhism, which helped to create her design.
She's a very fleshed-out character with quite the story and interesting details. If she becomes too injured, she'll die and turn into the form of a jellyfish. However, she'll regenerate to her human form in time.
Originally, the image of death was rather strong in her design. However, she now has a much lighter appearance. Now she's based on giving light to those in pain and using that light to bring resolution. According to Miyama, LUMi is now “life.”
However, the theme of LUMi as death is still present, so he believes that LUMi is now representing “death for life.”
The Keywords “Buddhism” and “Jellyfish”
Yoshizawa Kaoru of AVA, who planned LUMi, was the one who decided on LUMi being connected to Buddhism. He originally imagined LUMi being a Bodhisattva, a person who is able to reach nirvana but delays doing so out of compassion in order to save suffering beings.
While searching for creatures that could be visual motifs, he found the perfect inspiration: the Turritopsis nutricula or Benikurage, as it's called in Japanese. Turritopsis nutricula are called “immortal jellyfish.” Whenever the jellyfish is injured, sick, or dying, it reverts back to a younger form. This allows the jellyfish to live forever! As long as nothing eats it, of course.
Change of Concepts
Original Concept Art
LUMi's initial design was different from her current one. The previous design was based on a jellyfish imitating a human's form. She had no eyes or nose.
However, Miyama realized it would be difficult to establish such a character. Instead, he decided to approach her slightly differently. He added a bit of a high school girl theme. However, he made sure to keep the balance between her jellyfish design and her human features. According to Miyama, you can see the delicate balance all over her design.
Hopes for LUMi in the Future
Miyama hopes for LUMi to be successful in the future. He is looking forward to seeing what she'll accomplish. In addition, they hope that LUMi will experience many things and be able to save lots of people.
More Information
Stayed tuned to VNN for more information as it surfaces! LUMi's trial is set to come out on June 3rd. Hopefully, we'll have even more LUMi news by then!
You can check out our original LUMi article for more information about her.

Simon Mignolet believes Jurgen Klopp's infectious personality has already rubbed off on the Liverpool squad.
The new manager's reign began with a gutsy 0-0 draw at Tottenham on Saturday and the goalkeeper says the players responded to his demand to go “full blast” in the capital.
“As you can see he is very enthusiastic and very ambitious,” Mignolet said.
“On the line you can see that and it rubs off on the players. He is very positive and he wants everyone to go full blast, like he is as well. And that is good because it goes on to the young players and they can thrive on that.
“His sense of humour is different. It is not English, it is German. It's nice and he's a good man.
“Every manager has his own style and tactics and he worked hard this week to make sure we put them under pressure. He speaks with everybody and what is good is he gives people confidence.
“He wants us to go 100% and that positivity, enthusiasm and ambition is a positive for every individual.”
'He congratulated me but that's not important'
Mignolet watched on as Liverpool dominated the opening 20 minutes at White Hart Lane before the Belgium international took centre stage.
As Spurs took control, the Reds shot-stopper made a trio of fine saves to ensure Klopp's men departed with a point,
“Everybody was pleased with the performance,” Mignolet said.
“With just three days after the international break, it is difficult to chance things. But it was obvious what he wanted to do - press them high and make it difficult for them to play.
“We did what the gaffer wanted us to do and tried to make it difficult for them to play football. Those chances we did give away you want to be there as a keeper and help out your team.
“He congratulated me but that is not really important. I am happy I made those saves, but I will keep both feet on the floor and not get carried away.
“Maybe with the ball we can be a bit better and try to keep the ball. We had a chance in the first half when he hit the bar and it was unfortunate because if that goes in it is a different game.
“But there is time to improve and to keep a clean sheet away to Tottenham is a positive and we can look forward to the next game.”

Mignolet feels no pressure
Mignolet insists he doesn't feel under any greater pressure to deliver for the new manager following the sacking of Brendan Rodgers, who bought him from Sunderland for £9million in 2013.
“I don't think you have to prove anything,” he said.
“Every day in training you want to get better. As a professional you want to work hard every day and improve yourself - that is how I see it.
“Obviously when there is a new manager it is always difficult at the beginning with the first steps with him because he doesn't know your character or your personality.
“But that goes out of the window when it is kick-off time. You have to play and be relaxed and focus on the job in hand.
“It is always disappointing when a manager goes. It means things are wrong and things are not going well. But when there is change there a chance of progress and for things to improve and you can thrive on that and look forward.
“From every individual, every manager, every coach, you learn something and you can only take it on board and put it in your backpack and go forward.”
WASHINGTON — Senator Bernard Sanders of Vermont said on Wednesday that he would try to block the Senate from confirming Ben S. Bernanke to a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The move is unlikely to derail Mr. Bernanke's reappointment, but it could slow the confirmation process and give the Fed's critics additional opportunity to press their case. As a practical matter, it means Senate Democratic leaders will have to line up 60 votes in favor of Mr. Bernanke rather than a simple majority at a time when the Federal Reserve is under increasing populist attacks from lawmakers on both the right and the left.
Mr. Bernanke will testify on Thursday at his confirmation hearing before the Senate banking committee. He is expected to face criticism for not doing more to prevent the financial crisis, and calls by some lawmakers for a sharply reduced regulatory role in the future.
Mr. Sanders, an independent, is not a member of the Senate banking committee, but he has frequently accused the Federal Reserve of bailing out Wall Street firms and the banking industry at the expense of ordinary citizens.

“In this country, there is profound disgust at what happened on Wall Street,” Mr. Sanders said in an interview. “People want a new direction and people are asking, where was the Fed? How did the Fed allow this to happen, when one of their mandates is to oversee the safety and soundness of the banking system?”

Mr. Sanders said he would place a hold on Mr. Bernanke's nomination when it reached the Senate floor. Under Senate rules, lawmakers would need 60 votes to override Mr. Sanders and proceed with a vote.
Driver's ed usually sucks, but not if you work for Conan O'Brien! For a new segment of the comedian and talk-show host's CONAN, airing on TBS, O'Brien took one of his staffers out on the road for a bit of practice.
In an 11-minute video uploaded to YouTube, the comedian took staffer Diana Chang on an adventure to learn the rules of the road. Along the way, they picked up Ride Along 2 stars Ice Cube and Kevin Hart for a lesson in driving with passengers.
First, Conan imparts some wisdom on the driver-in-training, lessons Diana wouldn't have found in any driver's ed course.
Conan tackles the important stuff: how to cut someone off, text while driving, and yell out the window effectively.
Diana was in for a surprise when Conan asked her to pick up Ice Cube and Kevin Hart, “upping the ante” and driving with “distracting passengers” in the car.
The two prepare Diana for a drive-by, and debate whether wearing a seatbelt is “thug life” or not.
Then the lesson takes a wild turn when Conan picks up a piñata that Hart and Cube fill with marijuana from a nearby dispensary.
It's not long until, driving around with a giant medical marijuana flag strapped to the hood, Diana, and the boys find themselves pulled over by a bike cop.
Hart rolls down the window after sparking a blunt, and weed smoke pour from the car toward the bemused officer.
Apparently, Diana was blocking a crosswalk. She cleared the crosswalk, and the officer pedaled away.
Concerned citizens should know that Diana herself did not smoke any cannabis while driving, and thanks to California marijuana law, her medically-licensed passengers could blaze without bother.
And the video did have some safety advice concerning seat belts, straight from Ice Cube himself: “Tupac was one of the biggest thugs I know, and he always wore his seatbelt,” he said.
Editor's note: The day after this story was reported, Jordan Jacobson admitted that it was a hoax, saying he'd posted the photo to Twitter in jest. Jacobson and a friend had confirmed details of the supposed incident in interviews with StarTribune and other news organizations. Please see the follow-up story here.
If Jordan Jacobson ever gets another chance to catch a Home Run Derby ball hit by Giancarlo Stanton, he can have the slugger's glove with him.
The 19-year-old ball-shagging fan from Lakeville stuck out his right hand Monday night at Target Field in an attempt to nab a blast from the Florida Marlins star during the All-Star competition among major league musclemen. But the ball deflected off Jacobson's mitt-less flesh and was pounced on by another fan more than 350 feet from where the 6-foot-6, 240-pound Stanton let it rip.
Jacobson could only stare at his swollen and bruised hand that night, an image prominently displayed on the widely viewed Deadspin sports website.
But Jacobson confirmed Wednesday that Stanton is sending the former Lakeville North baseball player a glove and a ball from the Home Run Derby.
“Thank you” was all Jacobson wanted to say, while verifying that Stanton's Twitter message about the gifts was true.
Jordan Jacobson, left, and Adam Alexander did get some face time on the jumbo screen during Monday's Home Run Derby.
“Sorry you had to ‘Bear' this pain @JJacobson13!” Stanton tweeted. “But look on the bright side, now u get my Glove & a Derby ball!”
In an earlier interview with a Florida-based sports and pop culture blog, Jacobson said: “It was extremely painful at first, then went numb after about 15 minutes. It probably would have felt better if I had gotten the ball.”
When he posted a picture of his hurtin' hand on Twitter, he wrote: “Note to self … Bring a glove to the homerun derby next year.”
Adam Alexander, who was with Jacobson at the derby, said his buddy reached out on Twitter to Stanton in hopes of some gain from his pain, a move that has paid off.
“Hey @Giancarlo818 thanks, I forgot to bring my mit,” Jacobson wrote, including a photo of the damaged digits.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- President Bush addressed Americans' anxiety about the effects that the U.S. economic downturn has taken on their wallets Tuesday, calling on Congress to pass legislation that will help reduce energy and food costs, keep people in their homes, and make student loans more available.
Speaking at a White House Rose Garden news conference, Bush said Congress has not passed legislation that he proposed to help ease the effects of the economic slump.
"I've repeatedly submitted proposals to help address these problems, yet time after time Congress chose to block them," said Bush.
Bush said Congress failed to pass bills that expand safe oil exploration and build new refineries that would help to reduce energy prices. The president said his proposal to expand oil production at home would result in about a 20% increase of crude oil production and it would likely mean lower gas prices.
He added that the farm bill that Congress is considering is "bloated," and would do little to reduce the cost of food.
"The bill Congress is now considering would fail to eliminate subsidy payments to multimillionaire farmers," said Bush. "America's farm economy is thriving ... and this is the right time to reform our nation's farm policies."
The president also called out Congress for failing to pass his proposed legislation to help modernize the home loan industry through Freddie Mac (FRE, Fortune 500) and Fannie Mae (FNM, Fortune 500) reforms, and by allowing state housing agencies to issue tax-free bonds to refinance subprime loans.
Lastly, the president said lawmakers need to pass a bill that would temporarily give the federal government greater authority to buy federal student loans.
"This authority will safeguard student loans without permanently expanding the government's role in their financing," Bush said.
Bush said Americans are looking for politicians to come together to work on these issues in a bipartisan manner.
"I don't think it's just too much to ask even in an election year," he added.
Democrats shift blame to President: But Democratic leaders said the blame instead lies with the president.
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a press conference the president is out of touch with the pains that Americans feel from the economic downturn.
"The president doesn't understand the struggles of American families," said Schumer. "Everyone is having a tough time to make ends meet."
Schumer also said that Bush has failed to address the most important factors that continue to drag down the economy.
"The president has lost control of the economy," said Schumer. ""He has ignored repeated shots across the bow: Record oil prices, the housing crisis ... none of these things are being addressed."
Schumer also scoffed at the president's claim that Congress supports legislation that would make energy even more expensive, saying the president continues to support the tax breaks on big oil companies.
"This administration has no energy policy," added Schumer.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, called on the President to drop his veto threat from House legislation that would give tax credits for renewable energy.
"[The bill would] save 116,000 green jobs and create hundreds of thousands more," Pelosi said in a statement.
Bush says economy not in a recession: Though the president maintained that the economy is not in a recession, he said that does not affect the pain some Americans are feeling from the recent downturn.
"Words that define the economy don't reflect the anxiety that Americans feel," said Bush.
1944: George Lucas is born in agricultural Modesto, California. He is a below-average student in high school, but rebounds to become one of the most successful independent directors and producers in film history.
Lucas had a passion for modding and racing cars that came to an end after he totaled his Autobianchi Bianchina days before graduation from Downey High.
After that fateful crash, Lucas picked up a camera and never looked back. He enrolled in Modesto Community College and commuted to San Francisco to soak up the experimental 16mm films of Stan Brakhage, Bruce Conner and others. He eventually met famed cinematographer Haskell Wexler, who became his first mentor. After transferring to USC film school, he met more filmmakers, including school dean and famous montagist Slavko Vorkapich, as well as students like Steven Spielberg and Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas and Coppola formed the indie studio American Zoetrope in 1969.
Lucas' first film for the fledgling enterprise was the underrated sci-fi dystopia THX-1138, a feature-length adaptation of his award-winning USC student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX-1138 4EB. It was not an outright success, but its fearsome vision of a futurist society governed by dispassionate machines intent on eradicating freedom and individuality would reappear in Lucas' world-beating franchise: Star Wars.
One thing that THX-1138 did not do was make money. That accomplishment was left to Lucas' second feature, the nostalgic '60s comedy American Graffiti, which not only was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, but also spawned the successful television spin-off Happy Days.
Flush with cash and clout, Lucas founded Lucasfilm in Marin County, California, in 1971. It would go on to birth special-effects pioneers Industrial Light and Magic, audio innovators Skywalker Sound, the high-fidelity sound reproduction standard THX, game peddler LucasArts and Pixar, the award-winning animation studio bought in 1986 by Apple guru Steve Jobs.
Since its 1971 founding, Lucasfilm has produced or co-produced work that is alternately amazing (American Graffiti, the Indiana Jones franchise), underrated (Willow, Tucker: A Man and His Dream, Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters) and forgettable (Howard the Duck, which Lucas quickly disowned after its 1986 release).
But it was his spiritual space-opera Star Wars that took Lucas from cinema standout to cultural and business influential. After pitching 1977's Star Wars: A New Hope to studios, he found only one taker, 20th Century Fox's Alan Ladd Jr.
Lucas sweetened the deal by waiving his up-front director's fee in favor of 40 percent of the box-office receipts and full ownership of the merchandising rights, which proved to be a prophetically savvy move: The epochal success of Star Wars netted Lucas hundreds of millions in revenue, setting the stage for the franchising and licensing deals that we now take for granted.
The stunning Empire Strikes Back and Ewok-infested closer Return of the Jedi followed shortly thereafter, sealing Lucas' reputation for good as a sci-fi heavyweight. After holding off the horde for years, he finally caved and revisited the franchise with a intensely anticipated prequel trilogy. From 1999 to 2005, Lucasfilm released live-action installments alternately considered amazing (Revenge of the Sith), underrated (The Phantom Menace) and forgettable (Attack of the Clones). Also in the mix was compelling animated TV programming like Genndy Tartakovky's stunning 2003 series Star Wars: Clone Wars and its currently airing CGI counterpart.
As Forbes' last count, the films — along with their lucrative multiverse-encompassing toys, games, comics, and other paraphernalia and ephemera — have earned around $20 billion. Lucas himself — recession notwithstanding —is still worth about three of those cool billions.
But those are just his artistic and technical achievements. Whether he's championing an educational wireless-broadband network at the U.S. Capitol, donating to the Martin Luther King Memorial on the National Mall, throwing his weight behind Barack Obama, or lavishly funding the film school that gave him his break, Lucas is plugged into not just art and tech but also politics and education.
What he didn't do is name the street on which Lucasfilm's sprawling Skywalker Ranch is located — well-known as 5858 Lucas Valley Road to industrious fanboys. That address was a pure coincidence. Or, perhaps, the will of The Force.
Happy Birthday, o Master Jedi.

Buy Max Payne 3 as a Steam Key.
About This Game
For Max Payne, the tragedies that took his loved ones years ago are wounds that refuse to heal. No longer a cop, close to washed up and addicted to pain killers, Max takes a job in São Paulo, Brazil, protecting the family of wealthy real estate mogul Rodrigo Branco, in an effort to finally escape his troubled past. But as events spiral out of his control, Max Payne finds himself alone on the streets of an unfamiliar city, desperately searching for the truth and fighting for a way out.
Featuring cutting edge shooting mechanics for precision gunplay, advanced new Bullet Time® and Shootdodge™ effects, full integration of Natural Motion's Euphoria Character Behavior system for lifelike movement and a dark and twisted story, Max Payne 3 is a seamless, highly detailed, cinematic experience from Rockstar Games.
MULTIPLAYER
In addition to an expansive single-player campaign, Max Payne 3 will also be the first entry in the series to introduce a thorough and engrossing multiplayer experience. Max Payne 3 multiplayer brings the same cinematic feel, fluid gunplay and sense of movement of the single-player game into the realm of online multiplayer. Using the fiction and signature gameplay elements of the Max Payne universe, Max Payne 3 features a wide range of new and traditional multiplayer modes that play on the themes of paranoia, betrayal and heroism, all delivered with the same epic visual style of the single player game. A feature debuting in Max Payne 3 and carrying over to Grand Theft Auto V and future appropriate titles is Crews, which go beyond traditional online clans by allowing players to join large public Crews or simply create a private Crew that members can customize. In this way, Crews help players keep the fight alive from match to match - and even across titles - through the Rockstar Games Social Club, which will keep track of Crew stats, including Feuds.
FEATURES
Something told John Bohannon that Grace Groovy was not a real editor at a real medical journal. It may have been her name, her bad spelling or her messy punctuation.
But there was Groovy's email, offering to publish an untrue and retracted piece of medical research as if it were valid — for cash up front and no questions asked.
Bohannon had written an intentionally incompetent cancer research paper with numbers that didn't add up, internal contradictions and conclusions that made no sense. He wanted to expose fast-buck science publishers who publish third-rate work as if it were solid.
“Any reviewer with more than a high school knowledge of chemistry” should have spotted the flaws, he writes in his investigation of publishing that breaks bad, and doesn't respect chemistry or anything else.
Yet 157 research journals from around the world offered to print it without corrections or editing. Grace Groovy, who claimed to edit the sober-sounding International Journal of Cancer and Tumor, was just one of many eager for the fee of several hundred dollars that scientists submit to be published.
Bohannon tells the story in Science — a very real and reputable journal — and concludes that such science journals are the “Wild West” of academic publishing. And they're multiplying.
He also noticed a funny thing about them. Many claim to be based in western academic centres but operate from halfway around the globe. For instance, Scientific & Academic Publishing Co. claims to publish an astonishing 200 journals from California, but its IP address and its bank are in China.
The journals themselves are online only, so it's hard for their readers to trace them.
The same company's American Journal of Polymer Science had material cut and pasted from the similar sounding Journal of Polymer Science, a real publication dating from 1946.
The shadow publications have fake addresses, fake names, and research whose quality is not checked.
The wave of what some call “predatory” science publishing takes advantage of a shift in the industry. Journals used to be printed and sold by subscription, but today many use the “open access” system: They publish only online and are free to anyone. The authors — scientists who want their work published — pay all the costs.
And researchers whose work isn't very good can always find a legitimate-sounding publisher willing to print it, errors and all.
Publishers even venture outside real science. A Texas journal printed a study that claimed to identify Bigfoot DNA this year. Independent checking showed it was largely opossum, and the journal belonged to the geneticist pushing the Bigfoot theory.
The effect of this is that low-quality studies are accepted into the body of published work that future scientists, doctors and engineers use as a reference.
“Do you want your surgeon reading questionable research? No,” says Cameron Macdonald, executive director of Canadian Science Publishing in Ottawa.
“The quality of the science is abominable” in some of these sources.
Academics say most open-access journals are above board, but the number of shadowy publishers is growing fast. They take cash from desperate researchers who must “publish or perish” in the university system.
“You can do a really half-assed job and get a journal up” online, Macdonald said.
“Many of them just appear and all of a sudden they're publishing 40 journals,” masked in academic words such as “institute” or “medical centre.”
Often they list no staff names or phone numbers, but only an email address and a PayPal account. If they do list reputable editors' names they just lift them from a university website.
“There's a lot of fabrication that goes on with these predatory journals,” Macdonald said.
They post articles in whatever format the scientist submits them, unedited. More crucially, they skip the review step in which journals normally send each study to independent experts to check. This allows mistakes to get through.
Some — far from all — are listed on what the industry calls Beall's List. Jeffrey Beall is a university librarian in Denver who got sick of shoddy publications, and decided to name and shame them. His list is at http://scholarlyoa.com. He found that suspicious journals make up back issues in order to look established, usually by copying and pasting work by other publishers.
And they solicit articles in the weirdest way. Beall shows that one publisher didn't know “Erratum” is science-speak for having to print a correction, not exactly a career highlight:
Dear Lakhtakia, Akhlesh, This is from Frontiers of Engineering Mechanics Research (FEMR). It is a great honor writing to you. We found a paper you published. It's an excellent paper which is well matched with the Focus & Scope of FEMR. Title: Erratum: Theory of thin-film, narrowband, linear-polarization rejection filters with superlattice structure … To promote the communications in the area of engineering mechanics, we are now sending our earnest invitation for you to submit new paper to FEMR.
Science magazine's “sting operation” by Bohannon found that 157 journals agreed to publish his bumbling work. Only 98 turned it down. There were 36 that pointed out its major mistakes, but 16 of these offered to print it anyway.
The largest proportion of journals accepting the bogus work (64 acceptances, 15 rejections) were in India, though most tried to conceal this.
CHICAGO (Reuters) - An experimental HIV vaccine from Johnson & Johnson combined with an immune system booster from Gilead Sciences Inc showed promise at keeping the virus at bay in monkeys even after treatments had stopped, marking yet another step toward the development of a so-called functional cure for HIV.

Both companies are currently testing the products separately in early-stage trials in people with HIV.
The study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, evaluated monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus, the monkey version of HIV, and showed the treatments were much more effective when used together than separately.
All nine monkeys that got both treatments showed significantly reduced viral loads. In three of them, the combination therapy has kept the virus at bay for six months after antiretroviral therapy or ART drugs were stopped.
The study is part of ongoing efforts to develop a so-called functional cure for HIV that would allow people infected with the virus to stop taking daily antiretroviral therapy. [L1N1CJ134]
“Current antiretroviral drugs, although they're lifesaving, do not cure HIV. They merely hold it in check. We are trying to develop strategies to achieve ART-free, long-term viral suppression,” said study author Dr. Dan Barouch, a vaccine researcher at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.
For the study, the team used what is known as a “kick and kill” approach. The two-punch strategy is designed to lure dormant HIV-infected immune cells out of hiding places in the body and then attempt to eradicate them.
The trial evaluated a therapeutic vaccine called Ad26/MVA, which J&J and partners are testing in early-stage human trials. The vaccine works by provoking a broad immune response from the adaptive immune system, the part that recognizes specific pathogens and produces lasting immunity.
They combined this with Gilead's experimental drug called GS-986, a so-called TLR-7 agonist that kickstarts the innate immune system, a more generalized line of defense that mounts the body's initial response to infection. Gilead is also testing this in trials of HIV-infected patients.
In the study, they evaluated 36 monkeys infected with SIV that had been treated with ART for six months to get the virus under control. They then divided the group into four arms, with one getting the Ad26/MVA vaccine alone, another getting the TLR-7 agonist alone, a third getting the combination of the two, and a fourth getting a placebo.
Then, they discontinued ART in all of the animals and monitored levels of the virus in their blood and lymph nodes. Animals that got Gilead's TLR-7 agonist saw no benefit and the virus quickly rebounded. Those that got the vaccine alone showed some reduction of viral load and a modest delay in viral rebound. The biggest effect was in the combination group, which saw a 2.5 times longer delay in viral rebound compared to the control group.
In this group, levels of virus in the blood were 50 times lower than in the controls, and the virus fell to undetectable levels in three of the animals, which have been off ART for six months with no viral rebound.
“If all the animals' viral loads had been undetectable, that would have been a home run,” said Barouch. “But the fact that all animals showed a reduction in viral load and three out of nine were undetectable, that's a solid base hit. It's definitely something that we can work from.”
Barouch said his team has been in talks with both companies to test the combination therapy in patients with HIV.
Chris here. I'm going to keep this brief and try not to be annoying! First up: if you didn't already know, we're running a kickstarter for the sequel to AI War, and that's a pretty big deal to us.
If you have not already, please consider signing up for the Headtalker campaign for AI War II. The true power of this thing has only really become apparent to me today, and it's pretty awesome.
Briefly:
If 500 people sign up — and there are 71 on there as of the time of this writing, including myself — then a big social media blast goes out. I guess kind of like a Thunderclap?
It tracks the amount of reach that we have on social media based on this, and basically it can be a way to get in front of a LOT of people. Out of just 71 people signed up so far, that gives us a potential reach of 960 thousand people.
Bearing in mind that a ton of those people will have zero interest in this, it's still a lot more targeted than advertising in some ways, and it's also not costing us anything (or you much time).
Given our current backer counts, less than a third of you would need to help out with this for a big blast to go out.
And actually you can recruit other people as well if you like who are not backers of the project — you never know if your friend's friends are strategy enthusiasts, even if that friend is not.
As with this kickstarter campaign itself, if the target is not hit, nothing happens. So if we don't get 500 people signed up, then the whole thing doesn't happen. Even if you have a small Twitter following or just a few facebook friends or a small group on linkedin or whatever else, that still is valuable in that it helps us reach that count of 500 people.
Thank you for reading!
That was annoying, and I apologize for that. To make it up to you, I'll give a few more tidbits about Reverse AI War, which I teased in update #8.
Basically:
It's a much smaller and shorter game, and made for serial replayability. Ideally games are 5-25 minutes long, depending on the complexity of the scenario you set up. I'd estimate 15 or 20 minutes on average.
I doubt it would be multiplayer, but who knows. Probably that would just be irritating to play with others, though, to be honest.
The game is set in the Arcenverse, in the timeline after Bionic Dues and Release Raptor, but long before AI War, The Last Federation, Stars Beyond Reach, or Starward Rogue.
You play as the AI at the end of Earth's history in this game. You may remember from the lore of Raptor that basically some humans got left behind on Earth while the rich and the upper classes fled to the stars.
The AI eventually chases the humans out into the galaxy, as we clearly see in the first AI War. However, before it can comfortably do that, it needs to take care of the planet that we both came from.
The overall idea here is thus that you're trying to kill the last of the humans remaining on earth. It really gives you a perspective of the sort of vaguely Risk-like experience that the AI has in AI War, but on territories on earth instead of planets and solar systems in space.
As with AI War, the AI (you, this time) have vastly superior resources to your foes, but also some weak spots. This game is also a David and Goliath simulator… but this time you're Goliath tasked with destroying David?
If that sounds easy, then you're forgetting the core weakness of the AI: blindness. You don't know WHERE all those pesky humans are. You thus want to do various things to draw them out, including letting them take some territory from you in order to expose themselves. Mwa ha ha, they think they're so sneaky…
…of course, the more you do that, the more you actually do risk that they pop up in surprising force and destroy your quantum computer, thus ending you. The other risk is that they escape into space, meaning that you've failed in your chief objective.
Overall I think it's a really fun concept, and it's simple and short and yet has good strategy to it. As I mentioned before, I hope to have a WebGL online demo you can play by the end of November.
Depending on how things progress with this kickstarter, I might be convinced to give out copies of this to all backers above some certain tier… ;)
That's all for now! Sorry for being annoying about the Headtalker thing, but if you can help out with if it is definitely appreciated. And hopefully the Reverse AI War details make up for it.
Cheers!

Staff at an area ski resort sang and told jokes to comfort scared children who sat on a broken chairlift many metres above in frigid temperatures Saturday afternoon, one skier says.
Bryan Alberton, 39, had brought his 11-year-old son, Tristan, to Mont Ste. Marie, located about an hour north of Ottawa, for a father-son ski trip to cap off the holidays. It was the first time they'd been to the mountain, and was their first ski trip of the season, Alberton says.
They were on the Vanier chairlift at around 12:30 p.m. when, without warning, they and about another 100 riders on the lift halted.
“All of a sudden it just stopped dead,” Alberton told the Citizen from his home in Cumberland Saturday evening.
At first, it seemed like the issue would be resolved in a few minutes, he said. As they hung 20 metres in the air with snow blowing in, Alberton told his son to stay calm. “He was really good about it,” he said.
But as time passed it became clear the issue was more serious, he said. After an hour, Alberton began asking those around him what was being done to fix the lift and get everyone down.
He said ski patrol started the rescue with those at the very top of the chairlift because temperatures there were even colder than the -17 C (without windchill) he and his son were experiencing near the bottom.
In addition to the ski patrol members rescuing riders, one resort staff member stood below each chair on the lift to communicate with those stranded above, Alberton said. Employees threw blankets and used ski straps to fling hand warmers up to riders.
Alberton said his iPhone eventually stopped working due to the cold. Meanwhile, skiers and boarders passed each other messages one chair at a time, like a giant game of telephone.
“My concern was for the other kids,” Alberton said. Often, he said, parents will follow their children on the lift one or two chairs behind if there isn't enough space on one.
“One dad that was directly behind me, his kids were three or four chairs up, and he was real concerned for them,” Alberton said.
And in front of he and his son's chair, a handful of other children around the age of 10 sat alone, Alberton said.
“The kids were really scared,” he said.
But Alberton said staff below talked to the children, trying to get them to sing or telling them jokes. That part of the experience — seeing everyone trying to help one another — “was really cool, really neat to see,” he says.
After being stranded for nearly three hours, Alberton and Tristan were rescued using a cage and pulley system, he said.
By that point, neither could feel their feet. “It was tough to walk,” he said.
Staff members brought Alberton and his son directly to ski patrol, where they had access to everything from hot water packs to feet warmers.
“They had oxygen there for a couple of kids who were really cold. A couple of the kids there were real sicks; they were shaking,” Alberton said.
There was no report of injuries from the resort, although paramedics were reportedly on scene.
By 4 p.m., the resort's Twitter account had tweeted that all the chairlift riders had been rescued. It had earlier tweeted that it was removing people from the lift “as a precaution.”
https://twitter.com/MontSteMarie/status/551480011555753985
https://twitter.com/DBiffster/status/551478073678659584
Resort owner Bob Sudermann tweeted that the problem with the lift was related to a bearing, which he hoped would get fixed Saturday. The resort later said the issue had been resolved.
Goods News! We repaired the problem and our Vanier Lift will be fully operational tomorrow. It looks like a POWDER DAY. — Mont Ste Marie (@MontSteMarie) January 3, 2015
Back home in Cumberland, Alberton said he and Tristan were taking the night to sit by the fire, eat pizza and recover.
Asked whether they'd be back at the mountain any time soon, Alberton said, “Oh, yeah.”
“Stuff happens.”
Stranded on chairlift for 3 hours. So proud of my brave boy. Hats off to staff, ski patrol, and all volunteers @BobSudermann @MontSteMarie — Alby (@AlbertonBryan) January 4, 2015

An Oakbrook Terrace woman has been charged with animal cruelty and reckless conduct after leaving a baby alligator to fend for itself at O'Hare International Airport in November.
Alexis T. Prokopchuk, 29, of the 17400 block of West Eisenhower Road in the western suburb, was charged with animal cruelty and reckless conduct, both misdemeanors after she was arrested around noon Tuesday in the 100 block of North Ashland Avenue in Chicago, according to police. She was ordered held on $5,000 bail.
"Allie,'' as the 25-inch gator was dubbed, was spotted underneath an escalator in the lower level of Terminal 3 on Nov. 1. It was in poor condition, suffering from soft bones from a improper diet, among other things, authorities said at the time.
Police managed to whisk it into a box and Allie was transferred to the care of the Chicago Herpetological Society.
Prokopchuk had been spotted on surveillance cameras on the CTA Blue Line holding the gator and then entering the lower level of Terminal 3, where she let it loose, according to a police report.
Prokopchuk told officers she and her ex-boyfriend took the gator from a friend who was going to flush it down the toilet, the report said.
Then, on Nov. 1, she "was so (high) on crack cocaine and heroin and had taken some pills," that she lost the gator after coming to the airport, the report said.
A traveler going down the escalator spotted a "very lethargic'' Allie and grabbed an O'Hare custodian, who called police about 10 a.m. that morning. Authorities said it would "need time to recover."
Alligators like Allie normally live in temperatures of 85 to 90 degrees and can grow up to four feet and have the same life expectancy of humans.
Prokopchuk is due back in Branch 23 on Jan. 30.

Top Gear, presented by Clarkson alongside Richard Hammond and James May, was watched by 5.1 million viewers, a 17.2% share of the audience between 8pm and 9pm, including 793,000 on BBC HD, remaining by some distance BBC2's most popular show.
It was 150% up on the BBC2 slot average over the last three months and left Channel 4's docusoap The Hotel on the starting blocks, with 1.3 million viewers, a 4.2% share, across Channel 4 and Channel 4+1 (see our new ratings reporting style below).
It was a particular boost for the generally underwhelming BBC HD channel – due to be replaced with BBC2 HD – which enjoyed an 800% uplift on its three-month slot average.

Jim Inhofe isn't a scientist — and when it comes to climate change, he doesn't give a damn.
The longtime Oklahoma senator is the Hill's most flamboyant critic of climate research, denouncing the concept of man-made global warming as a “hoax” and a “conspiracy.” Now that he's about to take charge of the committee that oversees environmental policy, Democrats aspire to make Inhofe the face of GOP know-nothingism, while at least one Republican consultant says his style of skepticism could create headaches for candidates up and down the ticket in 2016.
Story Continued Below
Already, the liberal opposition research group American Bridge plans to monitor Inhofe's every utterance on climate change, and liberal strategists are planning how to use his chairmanship as political fodder to attack Republicans more broadly in the next election. One Senate Democratic aide called Inhofe's promotion a “silver lining” to Democrats' losing the chamber.
“Leave it to today's GOP to put someone who doesn't believe in basic science at the helm of the committee that oversees environmental protection,” Democratic National Committee spokesman Michael Czin said in an email Monday, putting the party's private smirking on the record. “It's unfortunate that Republicans continue to put more stock in their rigid ideology than science and what's best for the country.”
“What we're looking forward to is giving Jim Inhofe room to run and then highlighting his extreme agenda as something the American people don't support,” said one veteran strategist who works with environmentalists.
The turnabout threatens to put Republicans, who lately have deployed the artful dodge of “I'm not a scientist” when asked whether humans are altering the climate, in a tough position: Are you with Inhofe or are you with science?
“My own view,” Republican consultant and former George W. Bush adviser Mark McKinnon wrote in an email, “is that it would be helpful to the GOP brand that even if the candidates are not scientists, perhaps they could consult with some.”
A spokesman for Inhofe said the senator would have no comment Monday. But his allies warn that greens and Democrats hoping for him to play to the cameras on climate change underestimate the three-term Republican's ability as a workhorse, as well as his flashes of bipartisanship. Unlike some hardcore tea-party lawmakers, for instance, he often expresses warm personal feelings toward some liberals, including former EPA chief Lisa Jackson and current Senate environment panel Chairwoman Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.).
“There's no doubt that climate activists are going to try to make him into something he's not, but he understands how to win,” one ex-longtime Inhofe staffer said in an interview.
The Jim Inhofe guide to climate denial 1. “With all the hysteria, all the fear, all the phony science, could it be that manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people? I believe it is.” ( Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works) 2. “God's still up there. The arrogance of people to think that we, human beings, would be able to change what He is doing in the climate is to me outrageous.” ( Think Progress, Right Wing Watch) 3. “The claim that global warming is caused by manmade emissions is simply untrue and not based on sound science. CO2 does not actually cause catastrophic disasters. Actually, it would be beneficial to our environment and the economy.”( Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works) 4. “To my knowledge, nobody has uttered the term ‘global warming' since 2009. It's been completely refuted in most areas. … Those people who really believe that the world's coming to an end because of global warming and that's all due to manmade, anthropogenic gases, we call those people alarmists.” ( POLITICO) 5. “Alarmists are attempting to enact an agenda of energy suppression that is inconsistent with American values of freedom, prosperity, and environmental progress.” ( Senate Committee on the Enivronment and Public Works)
Still, Inhofe's outspoken skepticism on climate science stands in contrast to the caution that other Republicans showed on the issue during the midterms. Wary of a rising tide of environmental sensitivity among younger voters, conservative leaders from Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) to House Speaker John Boehner have protested that they lack the academic credentials to pass judgment on the science, insisting that the real debate should be on the costs of President Barack Obama's climate policies.
But Inhofe has never shied away from going much further.
The 79-year-old former insurance executive has cited the Bible as proof that climate science is a fraud and urged the Justice Department to investigate academic researchers working on the subject. In 2012, he wrote the book “The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future.”
During his previous turn chairing the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, from 2003 to 2007, Inhofe gave greens chronic heartburn and colorful combat. He wrote in a 2003 paper that rising temperatures “may have a beneficial effect” and compared the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to “a Soviet-style trial.” He invited author Michael Crichton to testify in 2005 about a novel that imagined eco-terrorist groups causing disasters to further their crusade against climate change.
Inhofe didn't let up after Democrats took the majority in 2007. He traveled to Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2009 for a splashy “truth squad” during U.N. climate talks. He told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow — another of his “favorite liberals” — that the White House-blessed statistic of 97-percent agreement among scientists about human-caused climate change “doesn't mean anything.”
After a record-breaking snowfall blanketed the D.C. area in 2010, Inhofe's family built an igloo decorated with a sign saying “Al Gore's New Home” — even though climate scientists point out that cold winter weather doesn't disprove a long-term warming of the Earth's ocean and atmosphere.
All this makes the thought of a Chairman Inhofe downright heartening to some green activists still reeling from the Election Day defeat they suffered after spending $85 million trying to elect their favored candidates.
American Bridge Vice President Eddie Vale called Inhofe a prime target for the tracking-and-research outfit's scrutiny. Bridge plans to turn a microscope on powerful committee leaders, Inhofe prominent among them, casting them as agents of special interests including the fossil fuel industry and billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch.
“The incoming Republican congressional majority's races were bought and paid for by the Kochs and big corporations, who will now be looking to make even more money at the expense of working families,” Vale said. “While we will be watching all of the Republican caucus, we will be paying especially close attention to the committee chairs.”
To Republicans, Democratic threats to weaponize the climate debate may sound more than a little hollow after the 2014 elections. Over the last two years, Democrats in coal- and oil-producing states from West Virginia to Alaska have been on defense against Republican charges that they represent an aggressive environmentalist agenda — and they took the brunt of last week's wipe-out.
Yet national GOP strategists also privately agree that the party must avoid a Flat-Earther image to compete in national elections. As damaging as the war-on-coal attacks may be against Democrats in oil country and Appalachia, the national electorate is not quite as enamored of fossil fuels — and is acutely wary of candidates who appear impervious to scientific evidence.
Strong majorities of Democratic and independent voters — but only 37 percent of Republicans — believe that “solid” evidence of global warming exists, according to the Pew Research Center. While many voters still balk at potentially costly measures to counteract climate change, political operatives say big chunks of the swing vote recoil from politicians who dispute “basic science.”
Democrats hope that means the familiar Inhofe bombast could backfire in 2016 for blue- and purple-state Republicans like New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who recently declined to join 41 other GOP senators in a call for Obama to yank his EPA climate rules. Republican presidential hopefuls who dodge climate change by noting their lack of scientific credentials, from Jeb Bush to Chris Christie, could also find themselves yoked to Inhofe.
But Inhofe won't be boxed in so easily, his former staffer said, saying the senator knows that EPA's regulatory agenda — on power-plant emissions, fracking, water quality and other issues — is “what people really care about” for the coming GOP majority. He said Inhofe, an outspoken fan of federal infrastructure spending, is also prepared to work with Boxer on a new transportation bill next year.
Another former Senate GOP staffer agreed, saying Inhofe would home in on the economic impact of Obama's EPA rules and avoid giving Democrats any easy opening. “I don't envision them having hearing after hearing, week after week, on climate science,” the ex-aide said of Inhofe's committee.
“It all depends on which Senator Inhofe shows up,” Kalee Kreider, a former Gore spokeswoman turned independent climate consultant, said by email. “If it's the same old Senator Inhofe, known more for his grandstanding and posturing than policy-making, then I would suspect that the Senator will not only be seen as an ineffectual chairman but also a liability to his party. If, however, the new Senator Inhofe shows up, the one who wrote the Tulsa World editorial this Saturday which articulated a positive vision, then, I suspect that it could be a new situation that the environmental community hasn't seen from him before.
“My wager?” she asked. “A leopard can't change its spots.”
I am not a feminist.
It seems like every time people in my classes find this out, they assume I don't understand what we're talking about. They try to explain it to me. I know what you're saying. I just don't agree. And that's okay.
Don't get me wrong; I'm all for equal pay. I think if a woman is doing the same job as a man (and just as good of a job), she should be paid the same. And if this were the early to mid-twentieth century, I would be a feminist. But this is no longer the first wave feminism. We are currently in what is called the fourth wave of feminism.
I don't want the things that these feminists are fighting for. And further explaining it won't change my mind.
“Why are women considered the more domestic and nurturing ones?”
Why do you think women give birth? How could you not be nurturing after carrying a child inside of you for nine months? And it is completely okay to choose to stay home and be a mother because that is the hardest job in the world. It is okay to like cooking. It is okay to take care of your husband and children. It is okay to want your boyfriend to ask for your father's blessing before proposing to you. It is okay to take his last name. Feminists wouldn't have you believe these things.
SEE ALSO: I Am A Feminist And That Is Okay
You aren't losing your identity through doing these things. You are showing what (or who) you value.
But listen carefully when I say that you are not called to submit to any man but your husband. You don't submit to your boss. You don't submit to your boyfriend. You don't submit to your brother. You don't submit to any man that you are not married to.
And women are not lower than men. I will agree with feminists on that. I believe that God loves me equally to how he loves the man that I will marry. But I do believe that the man is the head of the household. The man is to be the provider, protector, and leader of his family.
That is a lot of pressure. And I don't understand why feminists want to take it on. Why would you want that? God did make women as fragile beings. But He also made us as strong beings. As capable beings.
And while you are in your period of singleness, it is okay to be independent. But when you get married, you don't have to be. And that is thought of as a bad thing, when really, it is a gift. It is a weight lifted to have a husband you can lean on.
SEE ALSO: I Am A Pro-Choice Christian, And Here's Why
I am not a feminist, and that is okay . I do not want the power that men are assumed to have, and that is okay. I want to be a mom who takes care of her children and doesn't miss out on their lives. And that is okay.
It is okay to believe in traditionalist values. It is okay to believe in God and what He has taught us.
Five Ways to Increase Strength Off the Floor
Strength off the floor is very commonly a limiting factor in individual's deadlifts, cleans, and snatches. With these lifts, the “first pull”, from the floor to approximately when the bar is at the knee, sets the stage for the rest of the lift. If an athlete is weak off the floor, this could lead to either a missed deadlift attempt or encourage poor positioning for a second pull on an Olympic lift. The following five lifts with provide great assistance to increase strength off the floor.
Deficit Deadlifts
Deficit deadlifts increase the difficulty of the deadlift by making the lifter start with the barbell lower than its typical starting position. This starting point puts you at a biomechanical disadvantage and you must work and think much harder about maintaining proper pulling alignment.
Speed Deadlifts
Speed deadlifts are an excellent exercise to increase efficiency off the floor. While building raw strength should ALWAYS be a priority, learning how to accelerate and develop power is also important. What way to better learn how to develop power and speed off the floor than actually performing the EXACT lift you're trying to improve? Additionally, because a much lighter weight is needed for speed deadlifts, you can train them very frequently. This is a great way to perfect your form and get a training effect without beating yourself up.
Paused Snatch Deadlift
The pause snatch deadlift combines two powerful deadlift changes to improve your pull from the floor. First, the snatch grip increases the range of motion you must pull through by starting you in a lower position (much like a deficit deadlift). Up next the pause just off of the floor seriously increases the spinal control you must develop to keep good positioning.
Paused Safety Bar Squats
A strong pull off the floor requires a combination of leg, back, and core strength and the paused safety bar squat nails all three. With this squat variation, the load is placed pretty high up on the back, causing the upper back to work very hard to avoid rounding forward…a KEY component in the deadlift. The safety squat bar and its placement also provides some degree of instability during the lift, requiring good core control and recruitment to stabilize the load as well. Due to the relatively vertical torso angle, you can go pretty deep on these, crushing the quads, another muscle group imperative for a strong first pull.
Pull The Slack Out of the Bar
If I had to give one master cue to help promote strength off the floor, it would be to pull the slack out of the bar. Speed off the ground is certainly important; HOWEVER, it must be something that is ramped up! Here's why. Depending on how much weight is on the bar, and the type of bar you are using, upon applying force via the initial pull, the bar will MOVE before the weights come off the ground! Speed should NOT be applied until this slack is taken out! Taking slack out of the bar encourages full body tension to help enhance force transfer and reduce the risk of injury! Get tight FIRST, take the slack out of the bar, THEN apply speed for an efficient pull!
Is getting the bar moving off the floor your limiting factor? Use these 5 tips to help increase strength off the floor and break some PRs!

The New York Yankees have seen a 5.5-game lead over the Toronto Blue Jays collapse to 0.5 games from one Tuesday to the next by dropping five of six. This rough patch of six games, in which the offense has managed a total of 8 runs (they surpassed that with 9 in the 7th inning alone the night before the stretch began), has left the Yankee ship sinking, but it all started with floating.
Last Wednesday, August 5th, the Yankees faced the tough task of hitting the deceiving knuckleball, the floater, of Red Sox rookie Steven Wright. Wright has been making noise recently, thanks to his dancing knuckleball; the “knucklepuck” dazzled a potent Yankees lineup – at the time, New York had scored six or more runs in 9 of its last 12 games, including 21 unanswered in Arlington and twelve or more runs in 3 of its previous 4. He held the Bronx Bombers to 1 run on 4 hits through eighth innings, while sitting down nine Yankees by way of the K and justifying his Twitter handle @Knucklepuck23. Just two days later, New York was shut down, mustering 1 run on 6 hits, again off a knuckleballer, but this time it was veteran R.A. Dickey. That loss initiated a clean road sweep for the Blue Jays, their first in Yankee Stadium (Old or New) since May 2003, and after the Yankees crushing defeat in 16 innings last night, their losing streak sits at four, while the Jays' rose to nine.
Clearly the Yankees are having some sort of nightmarish knuckleball aftershock, rendering their bats useless as they recover from the two games of head-scratching swinging-and-missing. That makes one wonder why more pitchers don't throw more knuckleballs, especially given the dominance, as of late, displayed by rookie Wright and old-timer Dickey alike. Those 9 strikeouts in NY were a career high for the thirty-year-old Wright, breaking his record of 8, which he achieved just the week before in seven innings of work against the White Sox on July 30. Clearly, the knuckleball is working more effectively as of late, with his strikeout numbers piling up. Moreover, Wright limited the Marlins to 2 earned runs last night in Miami, extending his streak of two or fewer ER allowed to four games – a span in which he has lowered his ERA from 4.84 to 4.09. Meanwhile, Dickey one-upped the rookie with a six-game streak of no more than two earned runs, during which his ERA has plummeted from 5.02 to 3.93. But despite the recent success, Wright and Dickey could be better.
One main reason more pitchers don't utilize a knuckleball is the strain it puts on catchers as well as on umpires, a fact that is highlighted below. While watching a Red Sox game with the knuckleballer on the mound, it is hard not to notice the greater effort that catcher Blake Swihart has to exert just to catch the spin-less pitches, resulting in many futile attempts. And since they are a terror to catch, knuckleballs are naturally difficult to frame, which means that in addition to the greater pressure on the Sox backstop, there is an added workload for the home plate umpire. In an endeavor to follow the floating knuckleball, umpires often appear to rely more on catchers' pitch-framing behind the plate, which can be detrimental to a pitcher like Wright, particularly when your fellow rookie catcher doesn't squeeze 'em all. For example, Brooks Baseball shows a fifth inning knuckler in New York right over the heart of the plate incorrectly called a ball:
Unfortunately for Wright, this is not quite a once in a blue moon occurrence. To understand how Wright and Dickey would be superior hurlers if not for the boys in blue, a comparison to better pitchers, perhaps ones known for getting a few more calls – especially those in the lower portion of the zone where Wright's pitch above “missed” – will be useful. Since R.A. was the 2012 NL Cy Young Award winner, who better to compare to than the 2012 AL Cy Young winner, one who has been in five of the last six All-Star Games and led the MLB in strikes out in 2014. I am, of course, referring to the recently-traded David Price. An even greater contrast is the case of Houston Astros' SP Dallas Keuchel, who has received the most additional strikes from umpires this year.
FanGraphs' Heatmaps are a great tool for examining how and where Wright and Dickey are missing out on called strikes that could easily lower their slightly ballooning walk totals while magnifying their strikeout rates. This year is a particularly good one for exploring which pitchers are getting calls where, as umpires have called a notably expanded lower strike zone. Although Wright had very few starts in 2013-14, the data for 2013-15 will be shown alongside this year's for supplementary detail.
To get an introductory sense for the disparity in low-pitch called-strike percentage, we need look no further than the FanGraphs Heatmaps of 2015 Steven Wright vs. 2015 Dallas Keuchel:
However, we can get more precise in detailing the woes of knuckleballers. First let us define the following:
1) Zone – the strike zone, the box outlined in the thicker black line in the GIF above
2) Edges of Zone – the 20 small boxes that make up the outer edge of the Zone [the bottom 6 small boxes are the Bottom of the Zone]
3) Corners of Zone – 4 small boxes, 1 in each corner of the Zone
4) Expanded Lower Zone – the red-outlined 12 small boxes inside and outside the lower Edge of the Zone [the “Bottom of the Zone” + the 6 small boxes just below]
Below are various called-strike percentages for 2015 as well as 2013-15 for Wright and fellow floater Dickey compared to those of aces Price and Keuchel.
What should immediately jump out are the bright green numbers of Keuchel. Umpires this year have called 87% of his pitches in the strike zones correctly, a considerably higher rate than they do for our two knuckleballers and Price, who all get called strikes similarly within the Zone. Keuchel, with his catchers' help, has been convincing umpires on four-fifths of his pitches on the Edges of the Zone, where he holds an even greater advantage over the other three (whose numbers on the edges in 2015 are also very similar). The Corners and outside of the Zone tell the same story (in fact, Price gets even fewer calls on the corners and outside the strike box), but the bottom portion of the strike zone is where things get truly fascinating. Dallas has an astounding 83.1% called-strike rate in the Bottom of the Zone, better than the other pitchers' percentages in the Zone as a whole. Keuchel's numbers in the Bottom of the Zone and Expanded Lower Zone are almost double those of Steven Wright and almost triple those of R.A. Dickey, let alone the fact that they are leaps and bounds above the rates of David Price, a perennial All-Star.
All of the percentages discussed just above are current for 2015, and the 2013-15 numbers are even more unfriendly to our knuckleball-hurlers, considering that Keuchel and Price (whose 2013-15 called-strike percentages are closer to ace-level than in 2015 alone) were getting low-pitch strike calls even before umpires began to noticeably expand that portion of the zone this year. Given that pitchers are living more in the Expanded Lower Zone, where hitters are missing more, it is crucial that pitchers understand where umpires will be calling strikes and where they will remain silent. Wright's and Dickey's floaters may have sunk the Yankees' ship for the time being, but if these guys want longevity on the mound like Tim Wakefield, umpires are going to have to start recognizing the warning that knuckleballs near the edge of the Zone (especially in the Lower Expanded Zone) are closer than they appear.

President-elect Donald Trump invited members of the mainstream media to Trump Tower Monday for an off-the-record pow-wow some described as an “f-ing firing squad.”
Believing they were in for a discussion about the media's access to Trump, the presidents of NBC News, MSNBC and CNN, in addition to various other media figures, were treated instead to a brutal tongue-lashing.
“It was like a f–ing firing squad,” a source told The New York Post, adding that Trump specifically singled out CNN boss Jeff Zucker saying, “I hate your network.”
“Trump started with [CNN chief] Jeff Zucker and said ‘I hate your network, everyone at CNN is a liar and you should be ashamed,' ” the source said. “The meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down,” the source added.
Another source confirmed the version of events, claiming Trump also slammed two other female NBC correspondents.
“The meeting took place in a big boardroom and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks,” the other source said.
“Trump kept saying, ‘We're in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong.' He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was [a] network of liars,” the source stated.
“Trump didn't say [NBC reporter] Katy Tur by name, but talked about an NBC female correspondent who got it wrong, then he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when Hillary lost who hosted a debate – which was Martha Raddatz who was also in the room.”
Those in attendance included “NBC News President Deborah Turness, MSNBC President Phil Griffin, CNN President Jeff Zucker and network anchor Wolf Blitzer, Fox News Co-Presidents Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy and Executive Vice Presidents Jay Wallace and Suzanne Scott, and CBS News anchors John Dickerson and Charlie Rose,” according to Politico.
According to The Post, “Arthur Sulzberger, publisher of The New York Times, plans to meet with Trump Tuesday” – yet another publication Trump has frequently slammed as dishonest.

What can the NHS afford? Every week one pressure group after another protests at rationed treatments, as the NHS suffers its greatest funding shortfall since it was founded.
NHS will remain free to use and funded by general taxation, government says Read more
Today, it's Breast Cancer Now – and its case is exceptional. Usually rows over cancer drugs involve extraordinarily expensive new treatments, often not properly proven, offering a few months' extension at the end of life. But here is a cheap drug – bisphosphonates to be taken for three years at a cost of just 43p a day – that would prevent one in 10 deaths if given to all eligible breast cancer patients. A study in the Lancet shows it cuts the risk of cancer returning by 28% and the risk of death within 10 years by 18% – a significant effect. But it has been caught in a money row that is a typical symptom of the fragmented, competing service created by the 2012 NHS Act, where everyone offloads costs on to everyone else: should it be paid for locally (yes, says NHS England), or funded nationally (yes, say local clinical commissioning groups – CCGs – and providers). The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) – excellent but often too slow due to lack of resources – will not adjudicate until 2018.
And what of IVF? It's constantly picked on as if it were a mere lifestyle choice, like cosmetic surgery. But Nice decrees that every woman who needs it should get three free cycles of infertility treatment on the NHS. A survey shows only one in four areas in Britain offers all three cycles: who gets a baby is a postcode lottery as arbitrary as delivery by stork. Instantly on the Today programme, IVF campaigners were grilled as to whether desire to have a baby should really be a priority compared with, say, cancer treatments?
That's the way it always goes – one lot of NHS needs pitted against another, when the answer of course, is both. The pain of childlessness – a health malfunction – can be a lifelong agony, far worse than minor ailments that are treated unquestioningly. Nice recognises it and it is the best judge we have of value for money treatments when even a well-funded NHS always has to prioritise. Rationing is inbuilt in every health system – and it's far more brutal under US private insurance plans. The only question is only how much are we willing to pay for what? The RNIB reported this week that people are waiting up to 15 months for cataract treatment, as cash-strapped CCGs, ordered to cut their debts, ration non-life-threatening treatments, even if delay may be life-crippling.
What can we afford? A strong report emerged on Wednesday from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) – the government's getting and spending arbiter. Yes, it concludes, the NHS will still be affordable in 2030 and it could increase its share of GDP by almost a fifth. Just as growing numbers of politicians thrash around for new ways to pay – insurance or top-up fees – here come the official budgeteers saying the growth the NHS needs is affordable. Leading health economist Professor John Appleby, of the Nuffield Trust, says the OBR report shows the NHS can comfortably be paid for through general taxation.
We spend 7.4% of GDP on the NHS, but that's due to fall to just 6.9% by 2020: can that be kept to in the current crisis? Though Theresa May has told top health officials that there will be no more money, she may be forced to relent. The OBR says spending could rise to 8.8% by 2030, an annual real-terms increase of 3.5% a year, still less than the NHS's 4% average increase since 1948. Appleby says: “The real debate the UK needs to have is over how much more we want to spend on the NHS, not whether we need to change the way the health service is funded.” The OBR figure for 2030 simply puts us in line with most equivalent countries – such as France, Japan, Germany and the Netherlands.
The gap between funds and delivery is a chasm in the NHS: something has to give | Chris Hopson Read more
The House of Lords long-term sustainability of the NHS committee will report in March. This is a never-ending story, as the cost of the NHS has caused untold anguish to one government after another. Only five years after its foundation, the Tory government set up a commission to look into whether its long-term funding would meet future demand, though it only cost 3% of GDP then.
The NHS always had enemies – and its affordability is a 1950s question very like grammar schools. However often the evidence shows that the cheapest and most efficient way to pay for health is collectively through general taxation, there are some who imagine private insurance, or some kind of complex semi-private system, or top-up fees would magically see us all pay less for more. Year after year the US Commonwealth Fund points to the UK system as being the best bang for the buck – but mere evidence seems to count for less and less.
The one big question is how much tax we will pay for what standard of treatment. The NHS tops public concerns right now, and so it should. What politicians should really be asking themselves is how best to put this honest question to voters – what will you pay?
Sen. Bernie Sanders returned the The View on Monday. This time there was no ice cream.
In explaining the outcome of last week's election, Sanders admitted that President-elect Donald Trump “touched a nerve” in his appeal to economic concerns of working class voters in a way Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party failed to do.
“In my view, the Democratic Party has not been as strong as it should be in saying ‘Yeah, we're going to stand with the working people'” said the Vermont senator and former Democratic presidential candidate.
“Well you did,” interjected co-host Joy Behar.
“I did,” Sanders replied.

Behar suggested Sanders would have won if he were the Democratic nominee, instead of Clinton.
Sanders shrugged.
“The answer is who knows and who will ever know,” he said. Later in the interview, Sanders said despite Clinton's proposed policies, working class voters did not believe she “was prepared to stand up and fight for them.”
Going forward, Sanders said Democrats should work to hold Trump accountable on his pledges to help the working class and to call for a higher minimum wage, pay equity for women, increased infrastructure spending, reformed trade policy, and some other issues he believed there may be shared ground with the president-elect.
But Sanders also pledged to “fight against sexism, racism and xenophobia” under Trump's administration and said the controversial appointment of Steve Bannon as chief strategist “should get us very nervous.”
Bannon joined Trump's campaign in August after taking a leave as chairman from Breitbart, an alt-right news and opinion website.
“I will be damned if we're going to go backwards and try to divide up this country again,” Sanders said. “We are going to bring our people together. We are not going back.”
Sanders said that on individual issues, most Americans agree with his side.

“I don't call it the left. I call it the vast majority of the people,” he said.
Pressed on why the country elected Trump, Sanders questioned whether the Democratic Party had effectively communicated its message to the working class.
“Where was the Democratic Party?” he asked. “Has the Democratic Party been doing its job in telling working people in Iowa, and in New York, and in Wyoming, ‘We're going to stand with you. We have the guts to take on Wall Street. We have the guts to take on the insurance companies, and the drug companies and the fossil fuel companies.'”
“I don't think most people believe the Democratic Party has done that,” he added.
He reiterated that point in a series of tweets Monday.
His work as a composer is mainly devoted to acousmatic music, although he composed some mixed works. More specifically, his compositions employ esthetical criteria whereby he creates a ‘cinema for the ear' in which ‘meaning' as well as ‘sound' become the elements that elaborate his works. More recently Robert Normandeau composed a cycle of works of immersive multiphonic music for dome of loudspeakers. Along with concert music he has composed, for a period of twenty years, incidental music especially for the theatre.
He also worked as artistic director for over twenty years, especially for the concert series Clair de terre (Association pour la création et la recherche électroacoustiques du Québec ( ACREQ )) from 1989 to '93 at the Planétarium de Montréal, and Rien à voir and Akousma (Réseaux) from 1997 to 2006.
He is Professor in electroacoustic music composition at Université de Montréal since 1999 after completing the first PhDMus in Electroacoustic Composition (1992), under Marcelle Deschênes and Francis Dhomont. He leads the Groupe de recherche immersion spatiale (Spatial Immersion Research Group, GRIS ), which produces sound spatialisation software.
He received three Prix Opera from the Conseil québécois de la musique ( CQM ): two in 1999 — “Composer of the Year” and “Record of the Year — Contemporary Music” for Figures (IMED 0944) — and one in 2013 — “Record of the Year — Contemporary Music” for Palimpseste (IMED 12116). The Académie québécoise du théâtre ( AQT ) has given him two Masque Awards (“Best Music for Theatre”): one in 2002 for the play Malina and the second in 2005 for the play La cloche de verre, both directed by stage director Brigitte Haentjens.
Robert Normandeau is an award winner of numerous international competitions, including Ars Electronica, Linz (Austria, 1993, Golden Nica in 1996), Bourges (France, 1986, '88, '93), Fribourg (Switzerland, 2002), Luigi Russolo, Varese (Italy, 1989, '90), Métamorphoses, Brussels (Belgium, 2002, 04), Musica Nova, Prague (Czech Republic, 1994, '95, '98, 2012, '13), Noroit-Léonce Petitot, Arras (France, 1991, '93), Phonurgia Nova, Arles (France, 1987, '88), and Stockholm (Sweden, 1992) and Giga-Hertz (Karlsruhe, 2010).
He received commissions from The Banff Centre for the Arts, BBC , CKUT-FM, Codes d'accès / Musiques & Recherches, Jacques Drouin, Les événements du neuf, Groupe de recherches musicales ( GRM ), Groupe de musique expérimentale de Marseille ( GMEM ), Terri Hron, Claire Marchand, Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal, Open Space Gallery, Orchestre symphonique de Montréal ( OSM ) / Société de transport de Montréal ( STM ), Arturo Parra, Société Radio-Canada, Réseaux, Sonorities Festival, Vancouver New Music Society, and Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie ( ZKM ).
He was composer in residence in Banff (Canada, 1989, '92, '93, 2012), Bangor (Wales, UK, 2008), Belfast (Northern Ireland, UK, 1997), Bourges (France, 1988, '99, 2005), Huddersfield (England, RU, 2015), Karlsruhe (Germany, 2004, '05, '10, '11), Mons (Belgium, 1996), Morelia (Mexico, 2013), Ohain (Belgium, 1987, 2007), Oslo (Norway, 2015), Paris (France, 1990, 94), and Santiago (Chile, 2013).

Liberal plan to hike taxes on top one per cent may lead to revenue hole: study
TORONTO - The Liberal government's plan to switch some of the tax burden from middle-income earners to the top one per cent will likely lead to multibillion-dollar annual revenue shortfalls for Ottawa and the provinces, according to the C.D. Howe Institute.
The Toronto-based think-tank argues that efforts by high-income earners to avoid increased taxes will probably be greater than anticipated, while the reduction in the middle-income bracket will likely cost more than expected.
"The result of the federal tax changes could be national tax receipts falling short of commitments for both levels of government by more than $4 billion, meaning higher taxes elsewhere, unplanned spending cuts, or larger increases in government debt," the C.D. Howe Institute says in a study released Thursday.
The report, written by director of research Alexandre Laurin, bases its conclusions on studies authored in a number of countries, particularly the United States and Britain, which estimated the behavioural response of top-income individuals to increases in their margin tax rates
Among other things, the C.D. Howe study says some high-income taxpayers may decide to reduce work effort by choosing leisure over more labour, while others may plan their affairs in a way to minimize their tax burden.
"Tax planning can involve, for example, postponing an important taxable transaction, modifying income sources and forms of compensation and moving to, or avoiding moving from, a lower-tax jurisdiction."
The Liberal tax plan would see the federal rate on taxable income greater than $200,000 rise to 33 from 29 per cent. The rate on taxable income between $45,000 to $90,000 would drop to 20.5 per cent from 22 per cent.
However, the study notes that Quebec, Ontario and Nova Scotia now have combined federal-provincial top tax rates rounding to 50 per cent, while New Brunswick's rounds to 55 per cent.
"These recent provincial hikes unavoidably leave less room for the federal government to increase its own top tax rate," the report said.
Instead of raising income taxes on high-income earners, the federal government could explore other progressive, but less economically damaging, ways of raising revenues, it said.
"One option already envisaged by the new government would be to eliminate tax preferences targeted to high-income earners. Another would be to eliminate or to reform the small business tax deduction to better target younger firms rather than all firms that are small, including incorporated professionals," it said.
Donald Trump may have been the least surprised to learn about FBI Director James Comey's bombshell announcement Friday — 11 days before the election — that the bureau is reviewing new emails related to Hillary Clinton's personal server.
Turns out, the GOP nominee called it months ago.
The FBI discovered new emails on devices seized during an investigation of disgraced former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner, NBC News reported — it appears that Weiner and wife Huma Abedin, who figures prominently in the Clinton email probe, may have shared a laptop.
Here's Comey's memo to FBI staff explaining why he reopened Hillary probe
Abedin, a longtime loyal Clinton aide, separated from Weiner in August after additional sexting incidents involving her estranged husband became known, including reports he was interacting with an underage girl.
Trump was never shy about commenting on Weiner's perverted behavior, saying on social media back in 2013 that “Huma should dump the sicko Weiner” because he's “a calamity that is bringing her down with him.”
But he also saw the national security implications, considering Abedin's close relationship with Clinton.
Here are two related tweets from August 2015:
It came out that Huma Abedin knows all about Hillary's private illegal emails. Huma's PR husband, Anthony Weiner, will tell the world. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 3, 2015
Huma Abedin, the top aide to Hillary Clinton and the wife of perv sleazebag Anthony Wiener, was a major security risk as a collector of info — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2015
‘Dickileaks': Today's NY Post cover. . . wait ‘til you see the headline!
Even more on target was Trump's reaction when Abedin said she was leaving her husband, when Trump tied events back to his rival's “bad judgment,” saying it's “possible that our country and its security have been greatly compromised.”
“Huma is making a very wise decision. I know Anthony Weiner well, and she will be far better off without him,” Trump said in a statement.
“I only worry for the country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information,” he continued. “Who knows what he learned and who he told? It's just another example of Hillary Clinton's bad judgment.”

Meet 73-year-old Arthur Boyt, notorious resident of remote Bodmin Moor in Cornwall, and connoisseur of cooking and eating roadkill – nothing is too far fetched or fanciful to end up on his plate. In this film we take a trip into Arthur's universe and learn how to cook a cracking badger casserole, as well as find out how best to prepare polecat meat before cooking…
“I ate a badger once that someone else had picked up because they wanted its skull. It was blown up like a horse on the western front and it smelt rather horrible. When I cut into it the flesh was green but nevertheless I persevered and stewed it. It made the house smell like the old fashioned mental hospitals used too, but boy it tasted delicious!”
Gooooood morning, San Antonio! A big Texas “Buenos días!” to all gathered there at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center for the 95th annual convention of the American Association of Community Colleges.
A convention hall filled with 1,800 educators? Let's go Socratic. Questions trump answers.
Raise your hand if you are on food stamps. Nobody? OK, did anyone this morning has an expense-account breakfast or a free breakfast from one of the corporate sponsors? Didn't the tuition and fees from the nation's nine million (by President Obama's count) community college students pay for all the meals here in San Antonio? The plane fares? The hotels?
Question: How many community college students are on food stamps? I don't know, either. No one seems to. I've asked the AACC. I've asked the U.S. Department of Education. No luck so far. Raise your hand if students can sign up for food stamps on your campus. Yes, I see a few.
Now, break into groups of two or three. Question: What will you say to one of those students from your community college who is on food stamps? What are you doing here at a convention that doesn't have questions about hunger -- or the euphemism "food insecurity" -- at least anywhere I could find on the four-day agenda?
Why am I asking? I went to work at a community college to teach College Writing I. I've spent as much time, with colleagues, helping students at Bunker Hill Community College sign up for and recertify their food stamps as I have teaching.
Question: What are the big food days at the convention this year? From the schedule I have, it's a tie -- Sunday, one lunch, nine receptions, and a Latin rhythms dance, and Monday, nine breakfast meetings and a gala dinner.
Discussion question: Does the number of students on federal free and reduced lunch in your feeder high schools let you estimate how many students on your campus might be hungry? If not, why not? Use evidence to support your argument.
Over to the national scene. Question: Did you visit your state's congressional delegation to support President Obama's proposal for free community college? Did you propose a better idea? Did you spend more than one hour trying to figure out how to fund the president's plan at your institution? Did you ask your congressional representatives what they are willing to do for the nine million voters in community college classrooms?
No, no. That's not me down at the podium. I'm not on the program. I've just hacked into the Gonzalez Center's audio-visual system, up here on the Jumbotron, to shout, to scream, to wail the questions every one of you in San Antonio knows must be on the agenda for community college leaders. What do I know? Every one of you is more qualified than I am to give this speech.
Question: Is educating the poor the greatest all-talk, little-action topic in our national public policy?
I've hacked into the Jumbotron at the Gonzalez Center to give the keynote address somebody other than me ought to be giving. I've hacked into the Jumbotron here at the Gonzalez Center because again the agenda for the AACC annual meeting, sponsored by our students, whose tuition, fees and textbook dollars sponsor the sponsors, ducks the crisis everyone knows our students are in.
Obama's proposal? Where were we, community colleges? For the third time, President Obama has given community colleges the podium, the microphone and the spotlight. For the third time, where were we? It's our job, not Obama's, to find the funding and round up the votes.
Question: Does having Bob Reich, one of the most passionate, most eloquent voices on the dangers of poverty, of inequity, of inadequate education as your invited speaker, podium and Jumbotron, mean that everyone in San Antonio is doing enough for the nine million students? Well, I sent Professor Reich a copy of my speech. Ask Bob what he thinks.
Question: Why do we expect funding to land in our laps? Compare and contrast. For the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education victory stood on 20 years of targeted previous court victories. Community college leaders in 2015 won't show up unless a funded plan arrives tied with ribbons and a bow?
I'm going to read to you the opening of “A Talk to Teachers” that James Baldwin gave in 1963 to New York City public school teachers. Listen. Please, please, listen.
Let's begin by saying that we are living through a very dangerous time.
Everyone is this room is one way or another aware of that. We are in a revolutionary situation, no matter how unpopular that word has become in this country. The society in which we live is desperately menaced, not by Khrushchev, but from within. So any citizen in this country who considers himself as responsible -- and particularly those of you who deal with the minds and hearts of young people -- must be prepared to go for broke. Or, to put it another way, you must understand that in the attempt to correct so many generations of bad faith and cruelty, when it is operating not only in the classroom but in society, you will meet the most fantastic, the most brutal, the most determined resistance. There is no point in pretending this won't happen.
“A very dangerous time”? Question: We have nine million community college students. Community college professionals agree that no more than 50 percent are likely to complete their degree or certificate. What life in the land of the free and the home of the brave is left to the other 50 percent, to those who don't complete their degree or certificate? Poverty. That's 4.5 million human beings in our community colleges today who we know are condemned to poverty.
Crisis? Question: Why does everyone seem to think this 4.5 million is OK, an unfortunate fact of life? Where's the plan to remedy this?
Look at history books. Half the U.S. went to war to free the four million slaves. What will we do for these 4.5 million? Relative to the wealth, to the potential of everyone there in San Antonio, relative to the wealth and potential of this nation, by the standards of what's possible in 2015, what does it mean about us that we will let these 4.5 million students slip into a life of poverty?
I'm looking for someone, anyone in the Gonzalez Center this morning who also can't believe that condemning 4.5 million students to a life of poverty is an inevitable fact of life.
“A very dangerous time”? How many reports do we all need spelling out that federal and state higher ed funding is least for the neediest students? Walter Bumphus, AACC's president, you were on the task force, a signatory of the excellent "The Report of the Century Foundation Task Force on Preventing Community Colleges From Becoming Separate and Unequal." Why isn't a fix to those inequities the only agenda item in San Antonio today?
Question: Who said achieving equality and social justice is easy?
Let's listen again to James Baldwin: “You must understand that in the attempt to correct so many generations of bad faith and cruelty, when it is operating not only in the classroom but in society, you will meet the most fantastic, the most brutal, the most determined resistance. There is no point in pretending this won't happen.”
Funding? Under our noses. What about the tax policies that subsidize Yale, Princeton, Harvard and Williams students, on financial aid or not, to the tune of $20,000 or more per student, depending on your assumptions? When the most from the federal government for our students is a $5,500 Pell Grant, only if the students and their families have filled out the forms correctly. Will the Pentagon or those colleges give up their funding for our students without a fight? Of course not. Again, we didn't even try.
Crisis? Question: What exactly are the skill levels community colleges must deliver in reading, in writing, in math? How do those skills compare with those of freshmen and sophomores at Yale, at Harvard, at Princeton, at Williams? Impossible to say? We can't set national standards! Make my day. We can start.
“A very dangerous time”? Raise your hand if you know that your intro biology course would transfer to Mount Holyoke, Smith or Amherst. Raise your hand if you know that MIT would give credit for your courses in calculus and in differential equations. Of course this doesn't cover all nine million community college students. It's a start. If we're not matching skills with top students, how do we know about the rest?
Question: Could your students with, say, 40 or more college credits write an essay in 40 minutes analyzing the rhetorical strategies President Lincoln used in his second inaugural address to achieve his purpose? (I'm failing here. My students need a week at least and many drafts.) That's a question on an AP exam in English and Expository Writing.
If you have a better proxy of the skills required for freshman writing at a top college, let me know. If you think community college students deserve only lesser skills in basic thinking and writing for any 21st-century job, if you think community colleges can educate worthy citizens who don't know, understand, cherish Lincoln's words, I'd say, “Step outside,” but I'm 1,767 miles away, in Boston.
Time to return your Jumbotron to AACC control. While you're down there in San Antonio, remember our students who don't have food waiting at receptions.
What do I know about the 1,800 there in the Gonzalez Center? I know you can do James Baldwin proud, and go for broke. Why are we waiting?
Question: Why not close with President Obama? “Yes, we can.”
Eight years ago—that's something like five decades in Internet time—the Smithsonian held an exhibition, “More than Words: Illustrated Letters from the Smithsonian's Archives of American Art,” which featured a curated selection of 178 hand-illustrated letters, love notes, driving directions, and jottings of current events, from various artists. The selections can still be found online, even though Liza Kirwin's selections for the exhibit can now also be found in an accompanying book.
The illustrated letters make for humanizing insights into the private world of artists that we usually only experience through their work.
The 1945 letter from George Grosz to Erich S. Herrmann (above) is to invite his friend (and art dealer) to his birthday party, promising not just one glass of Hennessy, but six (and more). “Listen: boy!” he declares. “You are cordially invited to attend the birthday party of ME.” This was when Grosz was in his 50s and living in Huntington, New York. It should be noted that Grosz met his end falling down a flight of stairs while drunk, but the man knew how to party.
Joseph Lindon Smith was an American illustrator best known for being the artist who traveled to Egypt and documented the excavations at Giza and the Valley of the Kings, very faithful in their representation. But in 1894, this letter finds Smith, 31 years old, living in Paris, trying to make a go of it as an artist, and having enough success to tell his parents: “Behold your son painting under a shower of gold,” he writes. Check out that handwriting: it's beautiful.
Sculptor Alexander Calder wrote this note to Vassar colleague and friend Agnes Rindge Claflin in 1936, continuing some conversation they were having about color, and noting her choices mark her as a “Parcheesi hound,” and adding that he's a fan of the game too. The little illustration, which is straight Calder, is cute too. Claflin would later go on to narrate one of MOMA's first films to accompany an exhibit, Herbert Matter's 1944 film on Calder, Sculpture and Constructions.
This Man Ray letter to painter Julian E. Levi looks like it has been worried over or recycled—-“Dear Julian” appears several times on the stationery from Le Select American Bar in Montparnasse. It's a bit difficult to make out all his writing: he starts mentioning “Last year's 1928 wine harvest is supposed to be the very finest in the last fifty years” at the beginning, but I'm more fascinated with the bottom right: “I have seven tall blondes with 14 big tits and one with sapphire garters.”
Finally, we close out with a letter Frida Kahlo sent to her friend Emmy Lou Packard in 1940, where she thanked Packard for taking care of Diego during an illness. The letter gets sealed, Priscilla Frank notes at HuffPo, with three lipstick kisses -- "one for Diego, one for Emmy Lou, and one for her son."
There's plenty more illustrated letters to explore at the Smithsonian site and in Kirwin's handsome book, featuring artists well known and obscure, but all who knew how to compose a good letter.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN: On Thursday, the Democracy Now! team headed up to White Plains. Democracy Now! producer Mike Burke spoke to some of the residents from the public housing complex where Kenneth Chamberlain Sr. lived.
DINA JOHNSON: My name is Dina Johnson. I live here at 135. I was in the—I was woken up by the banging of his—you know, the cops was banging on his window, and it woke me up. And I went to the window, and I saw the police and the firetrucks out here. And they were saying, “Open the door. Open the door.” And he said, “I'm all right.” And basically they went back and forth with it until they said they were going to break down the door. And that's when they broke down the door.
And they began all this ruckus by just shooting and everything. You know, it happened so fast, I didn't think it was going to—I think—I thought it was going to—when they broke down the door, I just thought they were just going to tame him or something. I don't know. But it just went from one—from one to high, you know, from one scale to the shooting.
You know, so it was just very disturbing that morning. So, you know, I was very shocked. I didn't—I don't think they really truly investigated like they should have. And, you know, it's like it's OK for the police to come and violate somebody and kill him. And, you know, justice hasn't really been served yet, because of that situation.
ROWLAND HUDSON: My name is Rowland Hudson. I live in this building right here, 135 South Lexington, White Plains. I knew the gentleman who was killed. I didn't know what happened, 'til I came out and police said what happened. And from what I understand today, that they're not going to charge the officer. And I kind of knew that was going to happen, because of the neighborhood that we live in. I mean, you have police doing racial slurs now. I mean, when I came up, we had police officers who also grew up around here, who knew the neighborhood. I mean, you have—if you're going to be here and you're going to patrol the place, at least get to know the people who live in the area. This way, you know more what's going on, instead of just coming up and shooting a person. I mean, to me, it was just for no reason. But I mean, I expected this to happen. It's not surprising to me. I mean, I've lived here practically all my life, so I've seen the ins and the outs, the goods and the bads. So—and this is definitely one of the worst. And it's a shame. It's just a shame.
MIKE BURKE: And as a longtime resident, could you talk a little bit about Kenneth Chamberlain Sr.?
ROWLAND HUDSON: He was a quiet person. I mean, I knew him. I've seen him coming in and out. I mean, other people had things, bad things, to say about him. I have never seen anything like that. I've seen him coming out, taking care of his business. He had a car. He got in his car, did what he had to do, came back home. He was quiet to me. I mean, I've known him—he's lived here for a while. I mean, he's never bothered anyone, far as I knew. He had a life alert. That should tell the story. The man had a life alert. He fought—he fought for us, you know. I mean, what can you say? It's a shame. I keep saying that, because what else more can we say? That it's a shame, and we can just hope that it doesn't happen again.
DENNIS GRANT: My name, Dennis Grant. This happens every day, all day. Not—I'm saying it happens with cops, I'm saying. But those cops that did this were wrong. And everybody else behind them were wrong. And you need to step up and be accountable for what you did, make them pay. Not money. I'm saying we want no money, I'm saying, but you can't kill us like this. Anybody. Human beings. You can't kill us like this—white, black, whoever. You can't kill us and get away with it, for nothing.
ZABINI CHEVALIER: My name is Zabini Chevalier. I'm 14, and I live in this very same building right here. And the crime that was happened, like, when the police shot the old man that had the knife, I think it's tragic, because if you have so many police and they're supposed to learn how to restrain people, they're not supposed to just shoot the gun first, especially if it's an elderly.
MIKE BURKE: Do you feel like you have taken special precautions when you're in the street because of the cops?
ZABINI CHEVALIER: Well, sometimes I have to take special precautions, because sometimes the way I dress or, like, I'm in public and friends are loud, they'll probably ask me what I'm doing, and I'm not up to nothing. But you might have like a kid of like the white color, and he's walking around doing drugs, drinking, but they don't ask him how he is.
MIKE BURKE: And what have people that live here been saying about the shooting of Kenneth Chamberlain and the police action?
ZABINI CHEVALIER: Well, my family, they want to move out of here. They don't want to stay here anymore. It's just sad, because if we can't live in a building or this place right here, our community, and we can't be safe, it's just sad.
AMY GOODMAN: Those are some of the voices of the residents of the public housing project in White Plains outside the building where Kenneth Chamberlain lived. Your response, Mayo Bartlett?
MAYO BARTLETT: I think that they sum it up. They feel that they're under siege. And this is not in response to a crime. This is their daily life, coming and going from the grocery store and sleeping in your home and having fear of the police, instead of respecting them as people who are there to help you.
AMY GOODMAN: Just to be clear, Kenneth Chamberlain lived right there on the first floor, a stone's throw from both the courthouse and the police station.
MAYO BARTLETT: That's right, walking distance from each.
AMY GOODMAN: Finally, what you're calling for, Mayo Bartlett, attorney for Kenneth Chamberlain Jr.?
MAYO BARTLETT: We're calling for a federal investigation. And I think that there's a pattern that's clear with the White Plains Police Department that requires them to have a federal oversight. So we would like to have that, and we'd like to still have a criminal prosecution concerning the officers who've been involved.
AMY GOODMAN: And the DA, DiFiore, says she wants to be a part of that federal probe?
MAYO BARTLETT: Well, it's clear that she was given an opportunity to be a part of that, and Commissioner Chong now vows that he is going to investigate. But when we met with him in November, he told us that that process had already begun. Apparently, that was inaccurate.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And the police have also said that they're going to begin a top-down review of how they respond to situations with emotionally disturbed persons in the future, right? That's the part of the reform that they claim was going to come out of this.
MAYO BARTLETT: Well, if the police had followed their own procedures that currently exist, none of this would have happened. And those procedures could be changed, but you can't trust what they're saying, and they've proven that. Just simply the fact that we've gone from a hatchet down to a butter knife tells us all we need to really know.
AMY GOODMAN: Will you be suing the White Plains police?
MAYO BARTLETT: Yes, we will be.
AMY GOODMAN: Mayo Bartlett, we want to thank you for being with us, attorney for the family of Kenneth Chamberlain Jr. He is the former chief of the Bias Crimes Unit of the Westchester County District Attorney's Office and the former chair of the Westchester County Human Rights Commission. Special thanks to Mike Burke, to Amy Littlefield and to Sam Alcoff.

Energy policy is leaving the middle class behind
If you've paid much attention to policy in general, you won't be too surprised by what I'm about to tell you about energy policy. Many of our well-meaning public programs use tax dollars for the near-exclusive benefit of the wealthy—the group of people who need those shared funds the least.
Today I spoke at "What Will Turn Us On in 2030?", a conference about the short-term future of energy in the United States. At the conference, I met Lisa Margonelli, director of the Energy Policy Initiative at the New America Foundation. Margonelli has spent the last year researching the effects of high gasoline prices on middle class and working class families. (I'll be posting some more about that project later.) Along the way, she noticed some serious problems with the way we're currently trying to change energy systems in the U.S.—problems that actually endanger our ability to make real, long-term change.

A noisy neighbour who played music so loud that the bassline shook the walls from her house in Harlesden has been ordered to pay £1340 by Willesden Magistrate's Court.
Precious Watson, of Leopold Road, made her neighbours lives a misery by blasting out loud music with a thumping bass, despite being told numerous times by council officers to turn it down.
Watson was summoned to court on August 2 for her hearing but failed to attend, and in her absence the court found she was guilty of ignoring a Noise Nuisance Abatement Order.
The court heard how Watson, on three septate occasions, played music in her property so loudly that it was preventing her neighbours from sleeping.
Cllr Michael Pavey, Cabinet Member for Stronger Communities, said: "In Brent , we're committed to ensuring that every resident feels safe, happy and relaxed in their homes.
"The vast majority of residents 'Love where they live' and are respectful of their neighbours, including not playing music too loud.
"But there remain a small minority of noisy neighbours whose selfish and thoughtless actions are making people's lives a misery
"We will not tolerate such behaviour. Noisy neighbours can cause a host of problems, including sleep deprivation, which is unhealthy and can cause issues at home and work."
Martin Wood, Environmental Health Officer, added: "This tenant had little regard for her neighbours and it is reassuring to see the court recognised the severity of this by imposing a substantial financial punishment.
"We will be sharing the outcome of the Court hearing with Ms Watson's landlord, as evidence of noise nuisance is a sign that she is not living within the terms of her tenancy agreement.
"If you have a noisy neighbour who is playing music at such a level to cause a nuisance, please don't hesitate to report them on 020 8937 5252."
LOS ANGELES -- Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook suffered a small fracture of the second metacarpal in his right hand Thursday night, coach Scott Brooks said.
Westbrook exited Thursday night's 93-90 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers with 6:35 left in the second quarter and did not return.
Editor's Picks Adande: Thunder's West path gets tricker Without a margin for error in the unforgiving West, the Thunder are winless and now perhaps starless with Russell Westbrook joining Kevin Durant in street clothes, J.A. Adande writes.
Pelton: OKC crushed by Westbrook injury Kevin Pelton says the Oklahoma City Thunder will be hard-pressed to survive the rash of injuries that have hit them, the latest being Russell Westbrook's broken hand. 1 Related
Westbrook had X-rays taken at Staples Center and was set to be re-evaluated Friday. He returned to the Thunder bench in the third quarter, still in uniform but with a bag of ice wrapped around his hand, then left for the locker room again at the end of the quarter. He had a soft cast on his hand when he left Staples Center and didn't talk with reporters.
Depending on any displacement and the area of the break, treatment can range from a conservative approach with immobilization, or it may require surgery to stabilize, according to ESPN medical analyst Dr. Michael Kaplan, which could set Westbrook's recovery time between four to eight weeks.
As Westbrook was walking back to the locker room after the injury, he had to be restrained from a heckling fan yelling at him from above the tunnel.
Westbrook appeared to injure his hand while going up for a rebound and hitting Kendrick Perkins' elbow. After the play, Westbrook grimaced and looked down at his right hand as he tried to make a fist.
He finished with two points and four assists in nine minutes.
Without Westbrook, the Thunder, already playing without the injured Kevin Durant, Reggie Jackson and Jeremy Lamb, were left with eight available players.

Brooks was asked about the possibility of Durant and Westbrook both being out for an extended period of time.
"I don't want to start thinking about that yet," he said. "I'll think about that tonight as I leave the arena."
Oklahoma City plans to apply for the NBA's hardship exception, which allows a team to add an additional player to the roster if it has at least four players out with injuries for a minimum of two weeks. The current four are Durant, Grant Jerrett, Mitch McGary and Anthony Morrow.
If Westbrook is declared out, the Thunder will be able to apply for another hardship exception.
The players must miss a minimum of three games before the Thunder can apply for the first exception, so the Thunder can't file for it until after their game against the Denver Nuggets on Saturday night.
Westbrook would have to miss three games before the Thunder could apply for the second exception. That could happen after their game against the Toronto Raptors on Nov. 4.
"It's unfortunate the way it is right now, but we have to figure out how to get better from all of our experiences," Brooks said. "Good teams and good players bounce back from adversity, and our guys understand that."
ESPN.com's Kevin Arnovitz and J.A. Adande and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Free Day 2012 will be on Wednesday January 11th, starting at 9AM Mountain Time. We will be increasing the pool to $200,000 this year (2011 was pretty amazing!). We will have some sort of system to verify you're not a robot and if you're the lucky person that minute, you'll win a $100 gift code. That's it. Now go enjoy your turkey.
Wait, wait - what are you talking about Nate?
Oh sorry! You've not been here for the previous two Free Days. It's this thing we do to give back to our community and at the same time get some new friends to join the party. You come, you try, you might win a $100 gift code.
The Pool: 2011 is finishing up to be our best year yet. It looks like 2011 will be about 30% larger than last year so the Free Day 2012 pool will be 30% larger than last year's pool. That's $200k! That would buy you alot of heat shrink.
The Rules: The give away starts at 9AM MST (I'm sorry New Zealand!) and is limited to $100 per person (I call no cheating). Each winner will get a gift code that can be used on SparkFun within 60 days. There might be some slight modifications to the rules as time goes on, but don't fret - we will make any additional rules well-known prior to the big day.
The System: We're doing away with the quiz system of 2011 and trying to return to a give-away system that is as simple as possible, but can handle the load of the Free Day crowd. The system will randomly give away the 2,000 prizes (2000 * $100 = $200,000) through out the day. For example, if we set up a 7 hour giveaway window, we should see a gift given away about every 12 seconds. We will allow people to try for the prize as many times as they'd like, but we will have a basic system to prove you're not a script (sometimes robots can be bad).
So that's it! We hope you'll be able to stop by and join in the madness. Mark your calendars now, but we'll make a few reminder posts between now and the big day. Also, a reminder we'll be closed November 24th and 25th (Thursday and Friday) for Thanksgiving. In the meantime, enjoy the holiday (USA) and we hope you find some free time to start project #23 of your long list. Remember to join us on the 11th of January as well. No matter how the day goes it's always a lot of fun!
OECD data shows the number of years people take to qualify for a full state pension.
New Zealand's got a reputation for being friendly to immigrants, but the Retirement Commissioner thinks it's being just a little too friendly when it comes to NZ Super.
Commissioner Diane Maxwell has copped abuse for proposals released on Wednesday to cut state pension entitlements, including lifting the age people get NZ Super to 67 by 2034.
But there's one suggestion she's not been criticised for: increasing the time immigrants must be resident before getting NZ Super from 10 years to 25 years.
SUPPLIED Retirement Commissioner Diane Maxwell says the pension age must rise in New Zealand.
What wasn't immediately clear was that Maxwell meant her policy to also cover New Zealanders living overseas.

* Why world-beating NZ Super has a long-term future
* NZ Super age rise urged
* Time to address NZ Super-immigrant policy
* Generation Doom fear for NZ Super
* Defeated law change is another warning not to rely too much on NZ Super
Maxwell, who has a statutory duty to advise Parliament every three years on retirement income policy, thinks people should have 25 years as an "ordinary resident" in New Zealand after the age of 20 before they qualify for NZ Super, though they would qualify for emergency benefits if they fell on hard times before that.
Work would need to be done on an implementation plan, Maxwell's office says, but the proposal, if MPs passed it into law, would likely apply immediately to new migrants to New Zealand, but be phased in for New Zealanders currently resident here, who may opt to head overseas to work, and those already living overseas.
The current ten-year eligibility rule dates back to 1972 when most migrants were British, and their UK state pensions could be deducted from NZ Super, with taxpayers here and in their old homeland sharing the costs of funding their super.
These days many migrants come from countries like China where there is no state pension to help pay for NZ Super, which pays a married couple, who both qualify, $34,916.96 a year before tax.
New Zealand First welcomed Maxwell's proposal, while decrying her suggestion to lift the age of eligibility to 67.
The party anticipated her migrant call by tabling a private members' bill in October in Parliament calling for the shift from 10 to 25 years.
In his bill, NZ First MP Denis O'Rourke says: "Globally, 10 years is an unusually short time for full entitlement to a universal, non-means tested pension at age 65. Considering average life expectancy, New Zealand Superannuation is paid for 20 years, which is up to $460,000.00 per person at current rates."
The OECD in its Pensions at a Glance survey notes: "Australia and New Zealand are the OECD countries with the lowest residential eligibility criteria, as full benefit is paid after residing in the country for only ten years."
But Maxwell's recommendations fall short of NZ First's when it comes to New Zealanders returning from Australia to retire.
There are an estimated 600,000 New Zealanders in Australia, where the retirement age will begin rising to age 70 in a series of steps starting next year.
Australia's compulsory super savings regime means they are amassing far larger nest eggs than people living here are using KiwiSaver.
Yet under current policy settings they are able to return to New Zealand at age 65 to retire, immediately qualify for NZ Super, and have to contribute nothing from their super nest eggs towards paying for it.
That's because New Zealand's social security treaty with Australia says years spent as an ordinary resident in Australia count as years spend in New Zealand for the purposes of NZ Super qualification.
O'Rourke says his bill would mean New Zealanders overseas, including in Australia, would only qualify for NZ Super when they had been actually resident here for 25 years over the age of 20, so returning New Zealanders would have to live off their savings until they qualified for NZ Super.
New Zealand faces a surge in pension costs, if the change isn't made.
"It's not just Australia," O'Rourke says. "It's other countries like the UK and Australia raising their retirement age. People will come back to New Zealand to get NZ Super at age 65. We need to pay attention to this."
Auckland University academics Claire Dale and Susan St John, in their study New Zealand Superannuation Policy and Overseas State Pensions, say: "With Australia increasing the state pension age from 65 to 67 between 2017 and 2023, and introducing a harsher income test...New Zealand may become an even more attractive place for Australians to retire."
The academics said the Ministry of Social Development, which administers NZ Super, told them there were "policy interventions that could minimise the risk of New Zealanders returning to New Zealand to access NZ Super while the Australian Age Pension age of entitlement is rising."
It's not clear what those policy interventions are, but unless New Zealand First gets its way, it may add to pressure to lift the age of eligibility of NZ Super to match Australia's.
The United Nations has adopted tougher sanctions against North Korea, but experts say sanctions alone are unlikely to stop the country from pushing forward with its nuclear-weapons program.
NORTH Korea has dug tunnels underground, giving Kim Jong-un the ability to send 30,000 troops an hour beneath his country's border with South Korea for a stealth attack.
Fears have been raised that as many as 84 secret war tunnels have been built, with some boasting sleeping areas, a railway and enough space to move tanks, reports The Sun.
The existence of these sprawling tunnels has raised the risk of a surprise invasion amid heightened tensions between the North and South.
The first major tunnel, which stretches 3.5km in length, was discovered in November 1974.
It was found northeast of Korangpo in the DMZ, extending 1km past the official border and just 65km from the South Korean capital Seoul.
The walls, which are 1.2m high and 1m wide, are reinforced with concrete slabs.
The tunnel has the capacity to move one regiment an hour — which means between 10,000 and 30,000 elite soldiers could pour through the cramped space.
It was equipped with a narrow-gauge railway and rail cars and was lit with lamps connected to 220-volt power lines.
A second tunnel was found in March 1975, 13km north of Chorwon, which stretched 1.1km south of the heavily-fortified border.
Twice as wide as the first tunnel, it is large enough to send through heavy weapons, tanks and field artillery.
Troops would be able to march through the underground tunnel at three to four abreast — meaning thousands could be deployed in an hour.
The second tunnel ran for 3.5km at a depth of 160m and is it understood to be 2.2m wide.
A third tunnel was uncovered after a tip-off from North Korea defector Kim Bu-seong on 17 October 1978.
It runs for 1.6km, some 73m below the surface, just south of Panmunjeom.
After it was built, coal dust was smeared around the entrance so it would be disguised as an abandoned coal mine.
It is now blocked by three concrete walls — but it still has enough room to transport 30,000 troops per hour.
Another tunnel was discovered in March 1990 which runs for 1,052m.
The Daily Star reported that the South Korean government believes there could be 16 more undiscovered tunnels.
A retired South Korean general has previously claimed there were as many as 84 tunnels beneath the border.
But the South dismissed the claims made by Hahn Sung-chu, a former two-star general, saying they were “groundless”.

The photos released by the Russian Defense Ministry that purport to show US hardware at Islamic State positions could be a “quite damning” evidence of Washington's cooperation, Syria analyst Kamal Alam told RT.

“Since the beginning of this war the Americans have not been sure which group to back and every group they back seemed to be the wrong group or end up being allied to either Al-Qaeda or ISIS [Islamic State, IS, ISIL],” Alam, a visiting fellow at the Royal United Service Institute (RUSI) in London, told RT.

Aerial images shared by the Russian Defense Ministry on Sunday show the US military equipment stationed north of Deir er-Zor in what used to be Islamic State outposts (IS, formerly ISIS, ISIL). The lack of any evidence of clashes raises questions about possible collusion between the US-backed and Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the terrorists, he said.
It “seems like the US forces and their allies, the SDF, notwithstanding ISIS, are allowed to do what they do without confrontation,” Alam said, referring to reports that the SDF units are advancing toward Deir ez-Zor instead of pushing for Raqqa.
However, the fact that US military equipment can be spotted at terrorist positions is nothing new in itself, Alam argued.
“Over the last few years not just ISIS, but also Al-Qaeda in Syria which is linked to the Syrian opposition, they consistently had the US equipment and a lot of high-tech whether it's Humvees or anti-tank missiles or G-missiles.”
“Somehow all the US weapons end up in terrorists' hands.”

Whether those US munitions and weapons were intentionally transferred, or seized and handed over by third parties is unclear in most cases, he noted, adding that “it could be a mixture of both.”
“In the best-case scenario, the Americans have provided weapons to groups which they were not aware were linked with terrorists, but have often, more often than not, ended up with terrorists and these weapons could have ended up going toward ISIS but they were not meant for them.”
The photos and their interpretation by the Russian military are “quite damning if proven correct,” he said.

“It seems to be that from what we can verify from the pictures these positions are those of ISIS were standing side-by-side with the SDF, which are the allies of the US and using their equipment.”

Rapid advances by the Syrian and Russian forces are bringing nearer the time the war-torn country is brought back under control of the “legitimate government of Syria, as recognized by the UN,” which doesn't sit well with the US and part of the Kurdish forces, that strive for an independent state of their own in Syria and Iraq.
“[These gains by the Syrian Army] have made some countries, unfortunately, United States including, uneasy, because their allies, a lot of them, are either terrorists or allied to terrorists,” Alam said, adding that Deir ez-Zor, an area embedded with oil and gas fields, is of a particular interest to the Kurdish militias.
“At the same time, some of the Syrian Kurds want an autonomous country, that's impossible because Syria's entity as one state cannot be compromised, but if someone wants to and defeat the overall objective of the Syrian government and the Russian military, this could be a move,” he stressed.
The images were taken by the Russian military between September 8 and 12, shortly before the Syrian armed forces, with Russian air support, successfully broke the 3-year IS siege of Deir ez-Zor. The photos show several Cougar infantry vehicles, Hummer armored vehicles, and tents. Commenting on the images, the Russian Defense Ministry said that the lack of screening patrol to protect the US outposts might suggest that the US forces “feel absolutely safe” in the ISIS-controlled area.
As the 2012 campaign road winds its way toward South Carolina, frontrunner Mitt Romney's time at Bain Capital is under more and more scrutiny.
The Democratic National Committee has joined the fray, releasing a web video highlighting criticisms of Romney's dealings with the venture capital firm. Entitled "Don't Just Take Our Word For It," the clip crosses party lines, relying on critical comments from GOP rivals to get this opening claim across.
"Mitt Romney has a record of destroying the economic lives of companies, individuals, and entire communities as a corporate buyout specialist," the ad reads, before turning to Republican voices.
Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich, among others, spent some time this past week homing in on Romney's time at the firm. Gingrich targeted Romney's record as a venture capitalist, raising the question of how "the big boys made a lot of money and [others] went broke." Perry likened Bain Capital to "vultures" that ruin workers' lives, and highlighted decisions that cost jobs in South Carolina.
A Chicago-area mom is speaking out to warn others after she says her 22-year-old daughter died by consuming a deadly seed the young woman had purchased online, in what may be the first of at least two related deaths in the state.
With a few clicks of her mouse, Lucia McCalip was able to order the so-called pong pong seeds from Thailand for just $5, the woman's mother told ABC 7.
"It was slow and it was painful," Natosha Anderson said of her daughter's last hours after she was found on the floor of their Calumet City home two weeks ago.
Anderson said that when McCalip admitted to intentionally swallowing one of the seeds, no one, including medical personnel, knew what they were.
"The police, the paramedics, they didn't even know. No one knew," she said.
ABC7 This is part of the "pong pong" seed that was delivered to a Chicago family's home from Thailand. A mother says the seed fatally poisoned her 22-year-old daughter.
The toxic seeds, which originate from cerbera odollam or "suicide trees," can be easily purchased online as decorative items. They are found across India and Southeast Asia and are used by more people to die by suicide than any other plant, New Scientist reported.
According to a study published in 2004 and cited by New Scientist, the seeds were found responsible for the deaths of more than 500 people between 1989 and 1999 in the southwest Indian state of Kerala -- not only in accidental poisonings and suicides but homicides as well.
An eBay listing that had been selling pong pong seeds was recently removed, and a spokesperson for the website told The Huffington Post that they are working to update their hazardous materials policy to include the seeds.
"While Pong Pong seeds are unregulated, we have prohibited these seeds from being sold on our global marketplace out of an abundance of caution," the spokesperson stated in an email Thursday.
One user who recently posted a negative review of the seed seller on eBay wrote that their pong pong seeds were confiscated by U.S. Customs during delivery. They stated: "All I got was an empty box."
tewin via Getty Images Pong pong seeds, which grow from cerbera odollam or "suicide trees," can be purchased online as decorative items.
Amazon, which as of Thursday has at least three listings for the "decorative" seeds online, also prohibits the sale of plants and seeds that have been deemed “noxious” by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, according to their website. The seed is not listed among the USDA's banned plants on its website, however.
A USDA spokesperson said the plant and its seeds are not regulated by their agency because it is not considered an invasive plant.
Neither Amazon nor U.S. Customs and Border Protection immediately returned a request for comment.
Anderson, who said her child was transgender and referred to McCalip by her birth name of Bernard, expressed outrage over such a deadly item being accessible to anyone who has a credit card.
"I don't know how I'm talking ... I really don't, I really don't, but I think it's important. I don't want my son to die in vain," she said. "If I save one life, just one, then, we're doing good."
Scott Sefton, Lake County's chief deputy coroner, confirmed McCalip's death to The Huffington Post on Thursday but said that toxicology tests will take up to six weeks to complete.
"Our labs do not test for pong pong. There's only like three or four that test in the U.S.," he said.
In the meantime, he said local officials are investigating a second possible pong pong death about 300 miles away in Evansville, Illinois.
"I was told that today by a person I was talking to at the lab so that may also be in the works," Sefton said.

(CNN) He woke with a start, a strange pain in his shoulder.
Used to big hits and aching bones, pro hockey player Bryan Bickell reassured himself, blaming the pain on a strange sleeping position, a pinched nerve, or perhaps an infected tooth he had at the time.
But it didn't subside.
"It came back, and it went down my arm," the 6-foot, 4-inch, 223-pound left winger tells CNN Sport. "Then, after a couple of weeks, it went down into my leg. This was something different."
Revered by 20,000 fans every time he took the ice, suddenly the three-time Stanley Cup winner was feeling decidedly human.
"The signals I was sending to the right side of my body were off," Bickell explains. "Something was not right."
When he moved his stick, "it was not doing what I was telling it to do." It was as if the skills the former construction worker had honed from the Greater Toronto Hockey League all the way to the NHL had been stripped away.
Even worse was the realization he had to pull himself off the ice.
End of the road?
Then, in November 2016, he got the news.
Bickell, a veteran of nine NHL seasons, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS), a neurological disease that affects the central nervous system and for which there is no cure.
Thanks 2 all the fans for the prayers & wishes. It's all new 2 me & my family but seeing all the support from u guys makes it easier for us — Bryan Bickell (@bbicks29) November 11, 2016
Ice hockey had been his lifelong dream. He'd relished every moment playing, from the "odd mini-stick games in hotel hallways" to the game-tying goal during Game 6 of the 2013 Stanley Cup final with the Chicago Blackhawks.
What is multiple sclerosis? Progressive disease of central nervous system Affects nerves linking brain and spinal cord No cure but it can be managed with treatment Wide range of symptoms; fatigue is common More than 2.3M cases worldwide Women more likely to have it than men Diagnosis usually between 20-40 years of age
Suddenly he was confronted with an "indefinite" timeout
"It was difficult," the 31-year-old admits as he remembers contemplating the idea of the curtain falling on his 15-year career. "I didn't know much about it, but as the days and the weeks went on, you learn more."
Bickell found himself, against the advice of his doctors, researching his condition on the internet. He prepared himself for vertigo, sustained fatigue, intermittent loss of balance, and potential vision problems.
The initial months were a "roller coaster," but emboldened by the positivity of his wife Amanda, Bickell resolved not to let his diagnosis define him.
He'd been traded to the Carolina Hurricanes prior to the 2016 NHL draft as the Chicago Blackhawks sought to shed his sizable salary. It was there Bickell found the resolve to gradually return to the ice.
He built up his strength playing for the Hurricanes' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Charlotte Checkers, duly registering a primary assist on February 26, in his first game back.
Staff, including Hurricanes trainer Brian Maddox, couldn't believe his resilience.
"It's definitely a disease that would debilitate a lot of people," says Maddox, jokingly comparing Bickell to a walking "chemistry set" such is his extensive list of medications.
But Bickell took everything in his stride and his "great attitude" shone through.
Nice to get on the water a couple of hours and nice to get my first bass of 2017 thanks to my great wife @abickell and @shimanofish @tackleaddict @hukgear @molix_official_page @bassproshops for making it happen. A post shared by Bryan Bickell (@bbickell) on Jan 31, 2017 at 1:32pm PST
Off the ice, the big Canadian found psychological escape on Charlotte's lakes, recently acquiring a fishing boat to bring a little piece of home with him to North Carolina.
Such diversion, Bickell says, has been "a big help in adjusting to dealing with this," but the support of his Checkers teammates -- a "bunch of young guns" -- also boosted the stricken star.
"Some guys ask about it, curious," he tells CNN. "Some are scared to ask me, but I tell them. They're inspired and truly, I think, believe in me.
"They've seen what I've been through in my hockey career and they listen.
"It's something about hockey and the personality that hockey players have," he says. "We're a bunch of guys who become brothers. We'd do anything for each other, on and off the ice."
Fatherhood and NHL dreams
Ulf Samuelsson, head coach of the Checkers, remembers learning of Bickell's diagnosis.
We're a bunch of guys who become brothers. We'd do anything for each other, on and off the ice — Bryan Bickell
"You think the player is done," Samuelsson admits. "The way it affects your brain, how it tells your different body parts things. ... That's why it's so special."
Samuelsson, a two-time Stanley Cup champion with the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1991 and 1992, paints Bickell as a "big, powerful and skillful player" during his time at the top. The Checkers coach insists that if he didn't know about Bickell's condition, he wouldn't necessarily have noticed any difference.
Like to wish my Beautiful wife @abickell a happy birthday and Valentine's Day. A post shared by Bryan Bickell (@bbickell) on Feb 14, 2017 at 5:01am PST
"The guys around us are amazed, and people see hope," Samuelsson tells CNN. "The future looks bright for him."
Bickell wouldn't have made more than 380 NHL appearances without grit.
"I can visualize it," the player told CNN, dreaming of a return to his former standing in the world's premier ice hockey league.
"It would be emotional, having not known if I could play hockey again ... It would be special through everything, through all of the people who helped me get to this point on the road I've been down."
Bickell almost always spoke of "when," not "if," in discussions about his comeback.
Family, friends, Hurricanes, teammates, fans and mostly my wife. If it wasn't for you guys I would not be here. So blessed — Bryan Bickell
No wonder it felt like the journey was just beginning when he completed his "dream" return to the big leagues on Wednesday April 5, logging three hits in 12:36 of ice time for the Hurricanes against the Minnesota Wild.
Retirement
But in the unforgiving world of professional sport, nothing lasts forever.
And, realizing he could never reach the same levels again, Bickell announced he was to retire just four days after his first game back.
On Sunday April 9, Bickell went out on high, scoring in the shootout of his final game as the Hurricanes beat the Philadelphia Flyers 4-3.
Teammates wore No. 29 stickers on their helmets for the Hurricanes' final two regular-season games in his honor, naming Bickell as the winner of the 2016-17 Steve Chiasson Award for his determination and dedication through adversity.

There was no theatrical goodbye for Bickell. Instead, he and his wife Amanda participated in a walk around the Hurricanes' home ground in aid of MS research, where they were joined by the entire NHL team.
Bickell's top-tier sporting career may be over now, but at 31 he has his whole life ahead of him.
"I'm always going to be a hockey player, whether it's coaching my kids or helping out some locals," he tells CNN. "I'm always going to have hockey in my blood."
A piece by Chinese artist Zeng Fanzhi set the record for a piece of Asian contemporary art at auction on Saturday evening for Sotheby's 40th anniversary sale in Hong Kong.
After 12 to 13 minutes of high-excitement bidding, Zeng's painting The Last Supper sold for HK$180,440,000, or around US$23.3 million. The price was far above the original estimate of around US$10 million, and surpassed Zhang Xiaogang's previous record of HK$79 million for the highest-priced piece of contemporary Chinese art sold at auction.
With this record-breaking sale, Chinese art prices continue to inch up toward those of top pieces by Western contemporary artists. Both the growing number of new Chinese collectors and a continued interest in art for investment purposes among China's affluent are likely to lead to increasingly high records in auction seasons to come.
The piece was purchased by a phone bidder whose identity has not yet been revealed. Some auction world insiders are speculating that the buyer was Christie's owner François Pinault, an enthusiastic collector of Chinese contemporary art.
Paintings by other Chinese contemporary artists also did extremely well. A triptych by Zao Wou-ki set the record as the highest price ever commanded by the artist, bringing in HK$85.2 million ($11 million). In addition, Liu Ye's Sword fetched HK$42.6 million (US$5.5 million), Zhang Xiaogang's Bloodline: Big Family No. 12 sold for HK$25.8 million (US $3.3 million), and Yue Minjun's Between Men and Animal topped its high estimate with a sale for HK$9.8 million (US$1.2 million), demonstrating both the depth of the market and its promise for continued record-breaking prices.

With Illinois set to become the 20th state to legalize medical marijuana on Jan. 1, Chicago is taking steps to regulate how the drug will be grown and sold within its city limits.
And those regulations, layering on top of a law that's been described as the strictest of its kind in the nation, will be relatively strict.
Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the powerful Ald. Ed Burke (14th) on Tuesday introduced a proposal to require special-use permits for marijuana dispensaries and grow centers, in addition to limiting their location to manufacturing districts and requiring a minimum number of parking spots, the Chicago Tribune reports.
Burke said in a statement that "it is both timely and necessary to lay down a blueprint which spells out exactly how this new law will affect Chicagoans," according to the Chicago Sun-Times.
Meanwhile, DNAinfo Chicago reports the state is also expected to announce its plans to further regulate medical marijuana in January, when the law goes into effect.
The four-year medical marijuana pilot program Gov. Pat Quinn signed into law this summer allows people with 40-some medical conditions -- including illnesses like cancer, lupus and HIV are eligible, plus conditions including glaucoma, multiple sclerosis and residual limb pain -- to legally use the drug, after they obtain a medical marijuana card from a doctor, that is.
For offering low-cost teeth cleanings, the Arkansas Dental Board threatened to revoke my license and ruin my business. Now I'm taking the Board to court.
For offering low-cost teeth cleanings, the Arkansas Dental Board threatened to revoke my license and ruin my business. Now I'm taking the Board to court.
I have been a practicing orthodontist for just shy of a decade. Everyone who wants a great and healthy smile should be able to afford it. In 2008, I created Smile for a Lifetime Foundation, which grants free braces to children whose parents could not otherwise afford them. The foundation has awarded more than $20 million worth of care to deserving kids since then.
Dental work can be expensive, especially for those without insurance. More than 60 percent of adults in Arkansas visited a dentist last year. That number drops for those struggling in this economy. Only one-third of low-income Arkansans visited the dentist at least once last year. Arkansas clearly needs more access to improve oral health, not less.
To that end, last June, I started offering dental cleanings, X-rays and exams at discount prices: $99 for adults, $69 for kids. I wanted to increase access to top-notch dental care and shake up an industry that desperately needs innovation. Instead, the Arkansas Dental Board forced me to stop offering cleanings and threatened to revoke my license. Having my license taken would have destroyed my career and left 100 employees, many of them primary bread winners, out of a job!
Unbelievably, the Board is punishing me for having excelled in dental school and for having more education than primary care dentists. After I graduated from dental school, I was accepted into a competitive three-year, full-time residency in orthodontics. But under the Arkansas Dental Practice Act, it's against the law for dental specialists (like orthodontists) to provide the most basic dental services. Yet a primary care dentist is allowed to put on braces, even though he or she has had no formal training in orthodontics. In other words, general dentists can practice up, but orthodontists like me can't practice down. Only seven other states have this nonsensical law and there is no evidence that dental care is worse in states without the law.
The Board is using this backward law to stifle innovation, limit competition and keep prices artificially high for working Arkansans. One dentist even complained to the Board (which consists of seven dentists, one hygienist and one non-dentist) that he was "disgusted" by my practice of offering affordable dental services. In Arkansas, primary care dentists charge anywhere from twice to three times as much for the same services I was offering, so I can only assume why he was disgusted. But banning orthodontists from performing basic services limits competition and jacks up prices for consumers.
This ban even prevents qualified professionals from performing charity work. One of my colleagues, Dr. Elizabeth Gohl, is also a licensed dentist and orthodontist. For five years, she served as a dentist in the U.S. Navy, extracting teeth from hundreds of sailors. After Dr. Gohl left the Navy, she performed charity dental work in places like Brazil, India and Kenya, before she moved to Arkansas, where she now works for my practice.
After coming to Arkansas, Dr. Gohl tried to sign up for Free Extraction Day, when Arkansans who might not be able to afford costly dental work can get troublesome teeth extracted for free. Every year, the event helps hundreds of people. But Arkansas would not let her volunteer to help those in need because, like me, she's also a licensed orthodontist in addition to being a general dentist. Charity should not be against the law.
To increase access to low-cost care and defend our constitutional right to earn an honest living, Dr. Gohl and I are suing the Arkansas Dental Board in federal court. The Institute for Justice, a public interest law firm that fights for entrepreneurs all across the country, has taken our case. Arkansas' outdated law needs to be pulled like a rotten tooth.
Dr. Ben Burris, D.D.S., M.D.S., is the owner of Arkansas Braces and Braces by Burris and is a client of the Institute for Justice. A news report about this lawsuit appeared in the May 28 edition.

Republicans in the male-dominated Virginia legislature stand poised to demonstrate, yet again, that when it comes to gender politics in the state, tone-deaf is the new normal. As the legislative session for the part-time legislature opens this week, the plan is to remove a respected and accomplished female jurist, after five months served on the state supreme court, for purely political reasons that mostly amount to screwing over the governor, Terry McAuliffe. To do so would be a triumph for the sort of nanny nanny boo-boo partisanship that pervades our times, but it would also strike an irreparable blow to judicial independence and reinforce the idea that the good old boys of the commonwealth are beyond clueless when it comes to appearances, public office, and gender.
Virginia is nearly anomalous among the states in that its constitution affords the General Assembly the power to elect judges at all levels of the state court system. The governor has the authority to fill a vacancy with a recess appointment when the legislature isn't sitting, which in Virginia is often: Legislators meet for only 46 days in odd-numbered years and 60 in even-numbered ones. But the legislature must affirm that appointment when it reconvenes. It intends to do nothing of the sort this session, even though this would be the first time since 1901 that the General Assembly will fail to elect the governor's interim pick to a full 12-year term. Revenge, it seems, will be worth the blow to the prospect of a nonpartisan, independent judiciary, a reputation the Virginia Supreme Court has fought hard to earn.
As Carl Tobias explains in the Washington Post, last July, McAuliffe appointed Judge Jane Marum Roush, a former circuit court judge, to fill a vacancy on the Virginia Supreme Court left by Justice LeRoy Millette Jr., who retired. This was a temporary appointment, which would expire 30 days after lawmakers reconvened. Roush was first recommended to McAuliffe by a Republican lawmaker, is a universally admired 22-year veteran of the judicial branch with a reputation for being tough on crime, and presided over the trial of Washington-area sniper Lee Boyd Malvo as well as that of a notorious triple murderer. She is also the only judge from blue Fairfax County on either Virginia's Court of Appeals or Supreme Court.
McAuliffe, perhaps in an effort to sidestep the secretive and partisan nature of judicial elections, appointed Roush in July without properly conferring with the Republican leadership. It was a misstep. Tantrums ensued.
In August, immediately after the appointment, Republican lawmakers attempted to oust Roush in a special session, but they failed to garner enough votes to do so. Roush was at first invited to the hearing, then uninvited. Nobody wanted to interview her. Republican House Courts of Justice Chairman Dave Albo of the 42nd District explained at the time that he ultimately disinvited Roush because it would not be “classy” to subject her to a “fake interview.” Republicans would determine Roush's fitness to judge without hearing from her in person. Republican leadership, though, opted not to evaluate her fitness at all and instead threw their support behind another judge, Virginia Court of Appeals Judge Rossie Alston Jr., who is black. This led to a grotesque identity politics smackdown over the summer wherein Democrats argued that blocking Roush would prevent a qualified woman from taking the Supreme Court seat, as Republicans argued that any vote against Alston would prevent a highly qualified black judge from taking the bench.
Nobody has an argument against Roush's credentials. They're just mad at the governor. When the governor reappointed her in a second recess appointment in September, their beef with her became that she should not have accepted what they claimed was an unconstitutional reappointment. But the real complaint remains the same as it always was: She is perfectly fit but shouldn't have been appointed without consultation.
Roush's new temporary term will expire this February unless she is elected. The Republicans in the legislature, which is now in session, say that won't happen, and it looks like they are right.
The last time in Virginia history a justice was bounced for purely partisan reasons was in 1901. Every sitting justice appointed in a recess by the governor has been elected to the Supreme Court after the General Assembly reconvened, totaling 31 appointments in a row, which included the court's first black member and its first woman. Of course McAuliffe could have handled the appointment more deftly, but it's bizarre to unseat a well-respected Supreme Court jurist over a hissy fit. And if the objections are not about Roush's merits but about hurt feelings, it seems like a double hit to the integrity of the judicial branch.
It is beyond deranged to allow the legislature to elect state Supreme Court justices. Only Virginia and South Carolina do so. It is a recipe for disaster and a karate chop to the very notion of an independent judicial branch. But, setting that aside, this particular psychodrama is being brought to you from a Virginia legislature that comprises only 17 percent women. That means that beyond the question of what has happened, the question of how awful it appears looms large. As the Washington Post's Petula Dvorak has detailed, 24 of the 140 legislators in the commonwealth are female. It's as if it never stopped being the '80s here. And that means, as Dvorak noted last fall, that when a bunch of men boot one of the three women off a seven-member court for no reason other than petulance and pettiness, it's doubly unfair. Women comprise 51 percent of the population, but they only represent 29 percent of state Supreme Court seats. And this current situation is exactly the kind of smoke-filled backroom, tit-for-tat politicking that keeps women from putting their names forward for such seats and keeps them from being supported and protected in male-dominated legislatures. None of this started out as a fight over gender parity, but now that it looks like one, you can be sure women will notice.
You can sneer that McAuliffe is cynically framing Roush's unseating as part of a “war on women,” but cynically dumping a highly qualified and respected jurist, who gave up her own judicial seat to serve on the high court when she was asked, looks even worse. McAuliffe may have been extremely gauche. The Republicans in the House just look vindictive. The entire judiciary becomes tainted, and to what end? A black eye for the governor and a lasting blow to the independence of the judiciary? There will (hopefully) come a day when women will stop counting the number of judges and justices and comparing it regretfully with their numbers in the general population. But that day hasn't come, and when highly qualified women are taken out of prestigious positions because an old boys club has morphed into a small boys sandbox, the voting women of Virginia may not be pleased.
Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin have shown that synchronization emerges between brains when making music together, and even when musicians play different voices. In a study published in Frontiers in Neuroscience, Johanna Sanger and her team used electrodes to record the brain waves of guitarists while they played different voices of the same duet. The results point to brain synchronicity that cannot be explained away by similitudes in external stimulation but can be attributed to a more profound interpersonal coordination.
Scientists working with Ulman Lindenberger at the Max Planck Institute in Berlin already discovered synchronous brain activity between musicians playing the same piece in 2009. The current study goes one step further by examining the brain activity of guitar players performing a piece of music with two different parts. Their aim was to find out whether musicians' brains would synchronize if the two guitarists were not playing exactly the same notes, but instead played different voices of the same song.
To test their hypothesis, the psychologists arranged 32 experienced guitarists in duet pairs, and recorded electrical activity in different brain regions of each musician. They were then asked to play a sequence from the "Sonata in G Major" by Christian Gottlieb Scheidler a total of 60 times, and the duet partners were given slightly different tasks: each musician had to play a different voice, and one of the two was responsible for ensuring that they started at the same time and held the same tempo. Thus, one person took the lead and the other followed.
The duet's brain activities showed coordinated brain oscillations, even when playing different voices of the same duet. Called phase coherence, this synchronous activity suggests a direct neural basis for interpersonal coordination.
"When people coordinate their own actions, small networks between brain regions are formed. But we also observed similar network properties between the brains of the individual players, especially when mutual coordination is very important; for example at the joint onset of a piece of music," says Johanna Sänger. The difference between leader and follower was also reflected in the results of the measurement of electrical activity captured by electrodes: "In the player taking the lead, the internal synchronization of an individual's brain waves was stronger and, importantly, was present already before the duet started to play," says Johanna Sänger. "This could be a reflection of the leading player's decision to begin playing at a certain moment in time," she added.
The current data indicate that synchronization between individuals occurs in brain regions associated with social cognition and music production. And such interbrain networks are expected to occur not only while performing music. "We think that different people's brain waves also synchronise when people mutually coordinate their actions in other ways, such as during sport, or when they communicate with one another," Sänger says.
It is July. It is time for General Synod in York. This is the kick-back Synod. Time for sandals and open-necked shirts, strawberries and ice cream, and clergy not looking clerical, except for the ones who always do. But the external relaxedness masks some serious business.
Three pieces of business around sexuality and gender issues are to come before Synod. GSMisc 1158, the House of Bishops' proposals replacing the ill-fated report GS2055; A motion from Blackburn Diocese, GS 2071A Welcoming Transgender People; and Jayne Ozanne's Private Member's Motion on Conversion Therapy, supported by GS 2070A.
Jayne's motion asks for Synod to endorse a statement from January this year, signed by a number of significant professional medical bodies, as well as some advocacy groups, describing so-called Conversion Therapy “unethical and harmful”, and proscribing its use by their members. Jayne's motion also asks for the Archbishops' Council to become a co-signatory to the statement.
The Blackburn motion, which has been long-delayed, says this:
“That this Synod, recognizing the need for transgender people to be welcomed and affirmed in their parish church, call on the House of Bishops to consider whether some nationally commended liturgical materials might be prepared to mark a person's gender transition.”
It is the first time trans people's concerns have ever been debated by General Synod. Interestingly, its focus is on liturgical provision around transition. A most useful background paper by Dr Tina Beardsley, resourcing this debate, can be found here.
The House of Bishops, rocked by the rejection of their previous proposals, found the way ahead was sketched out by the letter of the two Archbishops published on 16th February 2017. In it the Archbishops stated: “we need a radical new Christian inclusion in the Church. This must be founded in scripture, in reason, in tradition, in theology and the Christian faith as the Church of England has received it; it must be based on good, healthy, flourishing relationships, and in a proper 21st century understanding of being human and of being sexual.”
GS Misc 1158 is their attempt to put flesh on the bones of that.
Sometimes the Church of England does some good things, some very good things, in relation to restoring dignity to people. It is not afraid of supporting refugees, both practically and politically. Its best work is seen in the way it responds to a disaster like Grenfell Tower – the local Church of England churches quickly became a centre of support, action, and care for the homeless, bereaved and traumatised people of North Kensington. It works well ecumenically and across all faiths and none, and there is no sense of this help being given conditionally or with strings attached. Among many churches and faith groups it is also Church of England churches that have enthusiastically set up and maintained food banks for those for whom austerity has had a very real practical impact.
These General Synod motions talk, variously, about the restoration of human dignity principally to people who are on the inside. Of course, the Church of England doesn't have an inside and an outside quite like other churches. It is the established church of the land, and therefore all English citizens have a proper interest in its actions and policies, even in its theologies, however inexplicable they may seem to many. Nevertheless, these motions are really for internal consumption. They deal, as so much Church of England business has over the years, with one of the really intractable difficulties the Church has made for itself, how it is to treat people in their sexual and gendered variety in the Church.
UK society has answered that question. Drawing on the traditions of human rights thinking that arise from very diverse sources, but which find their summation in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, our society has worked its way around, over the last fifty years or so, to thinking that no group should be discriminated against by virtue of its difference. (It is not insignificant that the principal author of that Declaration, John Peters Humphrey, was a Canadian, who, as a disabled and parentless boy, was relentlessly bullied when he was at school.) It has legislated to this effect, and so, while people can be racist or sexist or homophobic at home or in their heads, they can't behave that way in public.
The Church of England has gone some way towards accepting this social change. And some way to resisting it. There was never any question of the Church of England seeking opt-outs from race discrimination legislation. Why so? Perhaps, because a significant number of prominent English clergy were working in South Africa and were implacably opposed to the doctrine of separate development of the races. They saw and understood the injustice, cruelty and oppression that was the consequence of that doctrine, and had worked with the majority black populations. So, while racism was a danger in the 1960s in England, church leaders supported efforts to end race discrimination here. Its own internal record on supporting and developing ethnic minority leaders has been very poor in the past, but it has the theoretical tools and is making some effort to support doing a better job on that.
It has been less successful with its attitude to women. Resistance to equality between men and women in society is very deep-rooted. There is still a gender pay gap, and women still don't get paid the same as men for equal work. In the Church of England moves to equalise opportunities for women to offer their gifts and talents in God's service have come very slowly and rather incompletely. Theological justifications and ecclesiastical arrangements for unequal treatment have been enshrined and solidified rather than being discouraged.
But it is with its attitudes to gender variance and differences of sexual orientation that the Church of England has drifted away dangerously from the ethical moorings of the country as a whole. It isn't simply that it wishes to act differently. It is that the country now understands the equal treatment of all its citizens to be a foundational moral principle. Doing anything less than this is understood by the vast majority of citizens not simply to be undesirable, but at a profound level, immoral and unethical.
But this ethical thinking does not cut any ice with those who consider homosexual relations to be against the Word of God, or who think that gender dysmorphia is a wicked temptation to be fought against. How then can we frame the debates that are coming in Synod in such a way that they might start to make some sense to that minority of people who are so implacably opposed to change?
I want to suggest that there is in our tradition, and in the Scriptures, an enormously powerful recognition of the significance of the encounter of the individual with the divine. This encounter, from the beginnings of the human story as we have been told it, shapes the sense of self by that encounter. I become who I am through the I-Thou encounter (as Martin Buber put it). Abraham, Moses, Samuel, Mary. But also the unknown and the nameless – the woman who touches Jesus in the crowd, the disciples on the road to Emmaus. Among the great names of Biblical history there is an over-riding sense of the story of God's action through these encounters, working and changing lives for greater purposes, but there are also two other things worthy of note.
First, it is not always about a great call. It is always first of all a recognition of people's unique and wonderful personhood. That they are themselves before God, and in that meeting know themselves to be themselves. Sometimes fearful, they are always reassured, but they often simply encounter love, and they know themselves to be loved.
Secondly, no one but God tells them who they are. They find out for themselves what it means to be who they are. Indeed, the attempts by others to shape the identity of individuals is often a disaster for people who think they know best who someone else is. As GS Misc 1158 puts it:
If we presumed to say anything on this subject, we must know that we are talking about and talking to people, with their immense capacities for joy and for pain, created in the divine image and precious in God's sight in ways we can barely begin to fathom.(my emphasis)
There is an unalienable dignity about being who you are before God. It is deeply rooted in Scripture, and it has been worked out by followers of Christ in human history time and time again. It has not been an uncomplicated matter – and for pioneers it has often been painful and costly, and sometimes lonely. It has been through this process that so many people's gifts and talents have been liberated for the service of others.
Here is a new way to look at these matters. It is biblical, it is rooted in the Christian tradition, and its ethical foundations arise directly from the value that is in everyone because of their status as a child of God. Out of this essential vocation come all the other possibilities of human becoming.
So, of course we should make provision for trans people to find a way of marking their new identities. They know who they are – they certainly don't need us to tell them if they are allowed to be themselves. What they need us to do is to support them. They and God know the truth of their personhood – and loving communities around them, marking important moments of transition will start to liberate the potential within them for their own wellbeing, and for the good of their families and communities.
Conversion therapies wouldn't exist if it weren't for religious people keen to tell others who they can and can't be. But that is not their job. They are the most dangerous and damaging example of religious pressure imaginable. Evidence of the harm they do is well-documented. In the matter of human dignity, any solution to a human conundrum that pretends to know the end from the beginning attempts to bypass the relationship of individuals with God, and should be resisted by all those who know the foundational importance of that encounter.
GS Misc 1158 is not a document to make the heart beat faster. It outlines a lengthy process towards a teaching document by 2020. That makes nine years since the establishment of the Group that produced the Pilling Review. This latest document is clear that it wants to be working towards “radical inclusion”. Yet the membership of the group tasked with producing the report has only one person on it who is confidently and openly homosexual. And no one who is transgendered. The Pastoral Advisory Group is hardly better. Notably absent is anyone from the main campaigning groups in this field – OneBodyOneFaith, Inclusive Church, LGBTI Mission. The only person identifiable with a particular perspective is Sam Allberry (who would describe himself as Same-Sex Attracted) from Living Out, – a very small group, who think they know what God wants for all LGBTI people.
It is all very pedestrian, and still very exclusive. Voices that might upset the apple cart are carefully left out of the inner circle. It is still trying to manage a ‘problem', for all that it says it isn't. But what it fails to do is to accord to people the dignity that is theirs in Christ, and then to work outwards from that. It feels like an exercise in treading water in the hope that something might come along and save us, but with little expectation. It still reeks of fear and anxiety.
But our faith has told us the way forward. It is to stop trying to tell people who they can and should be, and instead to embrace the dignity that God has already given them. It is to stop boxing them and reducing them and telling them that they cannot exercise their gifts because they don't come in an acceptable package, and instead to welcome them in all their complexity and beauty, and to accompany them in their discipleship as they respond to the call of God. It is to listen to the divine voice that says, as it always does, “Fear not.”
I shall pray for Synod members. I shall pray for them to welcome and pass The Blackburn and Ozanne motions. And I shall hope that they will try and amend GS Misc 1158, so that it can truly do what it says it wants to do and make a real contribution to the “radical inclusion” our Archbishops set as the goal of our transformation in this area.
I talked this weekend to a young woman who is a member of the Church of England. She is a Millennial – a grouping beloved of our leaders. She is a regular worshipper, someone who is serious about her faith. She has thought about whether or not she might have a vocation to ordained ministry. She talked about the possibility of getting married. What she said was that she wasn't sure that she wanted to get married in church, because she didn't want to be married using rites that implied that same-sex couples couldn't be married as well. I was a little saddened to hear that – but then again, I thought she understood what radical inclusion really means. What it has always meant through the centuries. That human dignity in all its variety comes from God, and we should be fighting to honour it, not to diminish and demean it.

Trishna Begam - SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (NEWS10) - Saratoga Springs police are looking for a man who allegedly burglarized a Ben & Jerry's.
Police said the incident took place on April 10 at the Ben & Jerry's Saratoga Springs store. His image was captured on surveillance footage.
"Robbed us anywhere from $500 to $1,000," store owner Patrick Pipino said.
The money included some employee tips.
"It was pretty brazen," Pipino said. "Walks into the back room, stockroom, sees no one there, then goes in, gets into the safe somehow."
At the time, there was only one employee at the counter. After taking the money, the man walks back to the counter and asks the employee a question before leaving the store without being noticed.
"He looked like he knew what he was doing," Pipino said. "Wearing sunglasses when it was getting dark at night. I'm bummed out because we do a lot of good for the community."
Surveillance footage shows the suspect walked through a side door and let himself into an office meant for employees only. The office was unlocked at the time.
"I would like to see this guy in handcuffs," Pipino said.
Pipino posted the suspect's image on Facebook, and it's been shared hundreds of times. It has also been seen by several people lining up for ice cream on Free Cone Day.
"The ability to get the picture out there on Free Cone Day to say, 'Hey, do you know this person?' for tons of people to see," Saratoga Springs Police Lt. Robert Jillson said.
Pipino said his store would serve 9,000 people in eight hours.
"Pretty confident he's going to get caught," he said.
Pipino is also offering a reward of $250 and 100 free ice cream cone coupons for anyone who helps lead to the arrest of the suspect.
Police can be contacted at (518) 584-1800.
By now many EU citizens living in Britain feel disheartened and disappointed at Parliament's failure to secure their rights post-Brexit. A particularly concerning issue that emerged is the years-long misinformation surrounding the Comprehensive Sickness Insurance (CSI). Aleksandra Herbeć writes that failure of the UK government to communicate information about the CSI, also through universities, could mean that thousands of EU citizens in the UK face losing their eligibility for Permanent Residency (PR), and even the possibility of deportation. The media, too, have failed to cover the issue of CSI properly or to address some of its dubious aspects.
CSI – the legal loophole you have never heard of
In the past few days, the misleading term ‘Comprehensive Sickness Insurance' (CSI) has suddenly become a hot topic among EU citizens in the UK. For many of them, as well as their British relatives and friends, this was the first time they have ever heard about CSI. The chilling discovery was that for many years now the CSI has been a requirement for all EU citizens studying in the UK or residing here as self-sufficient persons. Without it, they cannot exercise their treaty rights and acquire permanent residency, which would normally be automatically granted after spending a continuous period of five years in the UK. At the moment, without a valid CSI the years spent in the UK do not count towards PR. Ominously, the current rules – some of which were introduced as recently as February 2017 – seem to give the Home Office the power to deport EU nationals who are not exercising treaty rights.few
The British media scrambled to publish curious assurances that the rules on deportation will not be acted on, and if they were, only selectively. The Independent went as far as quoting an immigration barrister saying that he does not think that “the Home Office is going to enforce this against say, the French wife of a British citizen. I think they're using it against people they don't like, like Polish rough sleepers.” While these speculative news reports were not particularly reassuring, they highlighted a passive acceptance of the arbitrary and demeaning use of regulations.
The CSI is a concern for thousands of EU nationals who, during their period of residence in the UK that would otherwise count towards PR, were at any time either a student, or a self-sufficient person (e.g. carers, stay-at-home spouses, or part-time workers not earning enough to cross a threshold set by the government). This would include cases in which an EU national worked full-time for 4 years and then enrolled at a UK university without having a CSI, thus unwittingly interrupting the 5-year residency rule.

A failure of communication
It is hard to understand why the fact that the CSI is a central requirement for many EU citizens in the UK has surfaced only now. It is indicative of a systematic failure of public communication that so many have learned about it only through confusing posts on social media. Many of the posts spoke of fears of deportation, of not being let back into the UK after holidays abroad, or being separated from British children or spouses at the border once Article 50 is triggered.
The official governmental channels of communication have done their best to be opaque on the topic of CSI. Also, while the House of Lords and many institutions and individuals, including British citizens living in the EU, have been calling for EU citizens' rights to reside in the UK to be secured, it is not clear if this would involve any amendments to the CSI requirement. At least up until the time of writing (13 March 2017), the UK government website used the following description for a ‘qualified person' who could apply for a registration certificate, and ultimately also for PR:
Fig 1: Information on Permanent Residency on the gov.uk website (13/03/2017).
Unfortunately, this information is rather incomplete, and EU nationals acting on it could unknowingly lose their right to acquire PR, and face uncertainty over their legal status.This might have been avoided if only the UK Government website was upfront about who might classify as a ‘qualified person' (Fig 2):
Figure 2: Suggested amendments for improving the gov.uk website on residency in the UK for EU/EEA nationals
Information on CSI is curiously sparse on the gov.uk website. CSI is mentioned briefly in the guidance notes and the PR application, documents that very few would have checked before actually beginning their application process. This is particularly unlikely as the gov.uk website seems to discourage EU nationals from applying for residency certificates:
Fig. 3: Information on the gov.uk website suggesting EU nationals do not need to apply for residency certificates
More broadly, the UK government has been passing laws on CSI without communicating them widely, not even through the organisations directly in contact with EU citizens, such as universities. EU nationals arriving to the UK have not been provided with clear information on the requirement to obtain health insurance in order to secure their rights.
Not so ‘comprehensive' after all
Once an EU citizen somehow finds out about CSI, they face another challenge – there does not seem to be a reliable source of information on what private insurance coverage would qualify as CSI in the eyes of the Home Office. Some private insurers advertise CSIs, but state they are not liable if their insurance ends up not meeting requirements. An insurance broker contacted by the author claimed that the Home Office has not issued guidelines on CSI and that they go by what is reported in the media and by their own experience with PR applications.
The mere fact of having health insurance from another EU country does not necessarily mean an EU citizen has CSI. They should have had a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) issued by another EU member state for every period in which they were a student or self-sufficient person in the UK. However, by being a resident in the UK, some EU citizens may have lost access to healthcare in their country of origin. In a further administrative paradox, relying on an EHIC issued by another EU country for the PR application will only be accepted if one confirms their intent not to live in the UK permanently (see Fig 3).
Fig 4: Screenshot from the PR application and a note on CSI requirement.
It is unclear as to how the CSI would relieve the potential burden an EU citizen might pose to the NHS. The PR application only requires one to have a CSI, not to have made use of it. Indeed, people with CSIs can still access GPs and all treatments on the NHS. EU citizens are in many circumstances required or strongly encouraged to register with a GP (including when enrolling at a university). Moreover, private insurers do not cover all treatments (even under the ‘comprehensive' sickness insurance), often delegating the treatment of chronic conditions to NHS.
Furthermore, CSI is discriminatory. Contrary to the Immigration Health Surcharge paid by international students in the UK, there is no standardised rate for private CSI for EU nationals. The CSI premiums depend on one's age, sex, health, and prior conditions, among others. This disadvantages EU nationals who are women, older, have comorbidities or prior health conditions. Even the cheaper options for healthy young adults (c. 30-40£/month) could be difficult to afford.
Obtaining CSI seems to be a purely administrative, box-ticking task for the PR form, without much real-life relevance or benefit to EU citizens, or to the NHS. In its current form, the CSI confers an unnecessary financial burden and a discriminatory barrier to residency.
How about the universities?
It seems that the UK universities were not prepared to offer their EU students (some of whom are their former employees) comprehensive information about CSI. In certain cases, they offered false reassurance that EU students do not require health insurance. For example, still in February 2017, the UCL website dedicated to health advice contained the following statement: “If you are an EU/EEA student, […] you may wish to consider private health insurance as well as there can be long waiting times for some NHS services. […]. However, medical insurance is not compulsory and is your decision whether you wish to purchase it or not.” A few days before the publication of this article, a rather unhelpful statement was added: “For EU/EEA students, the information provided above concerning medical insurance is relevant for accessing healthcare during your time as an enrolled student at UCL. More information about comprehensive sickness insurance can be found on the UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA) website.”
This further testifies to the lack of clear guidelines and bureaucratic chaos surrounding CSI, with few institutions equipped to offer specific guidance even today.
The author of this article has yet to meet an EU student who knew about the CSI before the issue surfaced in the media in the last weeks. Many still do not know about it. Some websites suggest that some university application forms for EU/EEA nationals ask whether the student holds CSI. However, given the legal implications of not having CSI, it does not seem sufficient to be informing students about it via a box-ticking exercise or a brief mention on application forms. Crucially, the information about CSI should always be contextualised and accompanied by information clarifying that (i) access to the NHS does not count, and (ii) that CSI is required to exercise treaty rights and accumulate residency rights.
What should have been done about CSI
The CSI regulations have not been implemented effectively, but this could have been avoided. The legality, practicality, and logistics of CSI should have been scrutinised before implementing the rules, and if they were still deemed to be appropriate, then:
The UK government should have been more transparent and vocal about the rules for EU citizens, and particularly CSI. There should have been procedures in place to ensure that EU citizens planning to come to the UK, and those already residing here, but also British citizens (who might be partners, in-laws, employers, tutors to EU nationals), are appropriately informed. Information about the CSI requirement should have been disseminated in a useful and non-threatening manner through many channels: at passport controls, via GPs, schools, religious associations, banks, TV and radio stations, unions, as well as universities (emails to EU students and their supervisors/tutors, at orientation days, freshers' weeks, special inductions). Such an information campaign should have been initiated ahead of the proposed changes to legislation and should have continued ever since. A simple government website should have been set up with comprehensive information on CSI, listing (a) clear rules as to what cover would qualify for a private CSI, and (b) a list of approved providers. This could also ensure that EU nationals do not fall victim to ‘sham' offers, or purchase wrong policies. Universities should have been provided with guidelines on CSI, and so that they could inform EU applicants about the rules, and the implications, e.g. that they may be losing their residency rights if they start degrees without being covered by CSI. The EU citizens should be provided with means to acquire CSI in time, including ‘buffer periods' to accommodate a change in circumstances. EU citizens should be able to make direct contributions to the NHS fund, if they wish to, rather than private insurers, with the rates standardised.
Challenging the CSI requirement
The current regulations and procedures surrounding the CSI requirement put EU citizens in the UK at a disadvantage when they apply for residency. Not surprisingly, CSI has been considered unlawful by some lawyers, and has been challenged in UK courts already, but with no success. Several petitions and MPs have also called for abolishing the rule. EU Rights Clinic tries to put a new case together and calls for stories on PR being denied due to lack of CSI. The time is also high for UK universities to join their plea to protect the rights of their current and former students.
Abolishing the CSI requirements altogether, and especially for PR applications, seems the only reasonable course of action. However, abolishing the CSI itself will not be meaningful without further securing EU nationals' rights in the UK post-Brexit.

As of this writing, the world's population is about 6.8 B.
In our country alone, primary statistical agency of the government National Statistics Office (NSO) projects that this year's population will reach 92.23 M.
This means that the Philippine population will reach over 140 million by the year 2040 according to the final results from the 2000 census-based population projects.
As the world population grows, it is inevitable that WE HAVE TO SURVIVE EACH OTHER.
There is just no denying that the impact of a growing population is a universal problem.
Taking turns when there is only one well.
Why so? This is because according to research presented during the American Association for the Advancement of Science, “as the world population continues to grow geometrically, great pressure is being placed on arable land, water, energy, and biological resources to provide an adequate supply of food while maintaining the integrity of our ecosystem. According to the World Bank and the United Nations, from 1 to 2 billion humans are now malnourished, indicating a combination of insufficient food, low incomes, and inadequate distribution of food. This is the largest number of hungry humans ever recorded in history. In China about 80 million are now malnourished and hungry. Based on current rates of increase, the world population is projected to double from roughly 6 billion to more than 12 billion in less than 50 years.”

True, this may sound highfaluting but this is the reality. Each day, we count how many children will be born with a dim future because of lack of proper information that every woman has a choice.
Our women and even their husbands or partners can still do something by deciding to limit or space pregnancies. Access to voluntary family planning and reproductive health services are readily available in government agencies like Department of Health (DOH), Commission on Population (POPCOM), service health providers in barangays or municipalities and other partner non-governmental organizations (NGO's).
A growing population has already become alarming but if population will continue to grow significantly, the effect will be devastating.
Imagine when every person is fighting for the most basic need according to Maslow's hierarchy which is food. It already happened in China and other parts of the world.
In our country, the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) reported in 2006 that 33 out of 100 Filipinos are poor. The severity of poverty in the Philippines needs no photos to show anybody.
“Res ipsa loquitor.” Indeed, one can just take a jeepney and see the shanties mushrooming near the rivers, creeks or just about anywhere. Malnourished children would play along the road like it was their playground.

Children have to stop studying or be told not to study at all because there is just not enough money to spend. Some are pushed by their own parents to work.
Four years ago in Brgy. San Jose, Arevalo, Iloilo City, the Educational Research and Development Assistance (ERDA) Foundation adopted some children who used to be child labourers to be their beneficiaries. This program by ERDA is commendable.
ERDA has over 19,000 beneficiaries enrolled in different levels of education all over the country. Its programs enlist school dropouts, child scavengers, street children, out of school youth, child laborers, children in conflict with the law, children of persons afflicted by leprosy and children of indigenous people. ERDA's educational assistance programs are available from pre-school up to college. Since its inception, ERDA has come to the aid of over 600,000 indigent children all over the country.
ERDA gives free uniform and school supplies to their beneficiaries as well as miscellaneous fees for elementary and high school students who used to be children working in hazardous fireworks factory in Arevalo.
Barangay Health Woker (BHW) Anabelle Indencio and Barangay Nutrition Scholar (BNS) Noreen Abada share that there are many communities with malnourished children because of poor health practices in the areas of these affected children.
Indencio futher explains that the problem is the congestion and the over-crowdedness of the houses which makes it dangerous to public health especially to children.
Abada on the other hand expressed that there are only 9 malnourished children in Brgy. San Jose at the moment. This is because they closely monitor the children weighing them if they have the expected weight according to their age. But she said that it is also difficult to expect that because these children come from poor families and they do not get the proper nutrition from their food intake.
There is still time to act. Empowering our women that spacing and limiting pregnancies is a good choice is the first step if our women want to do their share.
Bengaluru: The government intends to provide employment to one crore people in the country in the next two years, union minister Bandaru Dattatreya said on Tuesday. The union minister of state for labour and employment also noted that the government's skill development initiative has contributed towards creating a skilled work force in the country.
“Employer-employee relationship has been cordial after the Narendra Modi-led government came to power, so I am fully confident that we will provide one crore people with employment in the next two years," he said after inaugurating the Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) Nursing College and Auditorium in Bengaluru. Union minister for chemical and fertilisers Ananth Kumar and member of Parliament P.C. Mohan were present at the event. Speaking about the various “positive" legislations brought in by the department after the NDA government came to power, Dattatreya expressed hope that the new wage and industrial relations codes will be passed in Parliament's next session.
“I am confident that we will bring this wage, industrial relation codes to the parliament in the next session and get it passed. It will benefit labourers and the working class," the minister said. He said there were 44 central labor laws. “We are going amalgamate all these labour laws and rationalise it into four labor codes—wages, industrial relations, social security and safety, health and working conditions," the minister said. He also announced that a 200-bed ESI hospital will be set up at Bommasandra in Bengaluru at a cost of Rs150 crore, and 100-bed hospitals will be set up in Shivamogga, Narasapura, Harohalli and Ballari.
The 50-bed hospitals at Hubballi and Davangere will be upgraded to 100 beds, Dattatreya said. Ananth Kumar said the ministry for chemicals, fertilisers and pharmaceuticals would sign a MoU in 15 days with the labor ministry to have the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Kendra at hospitals run by it, in order to provide affordable generic medicines.
President Trump's aides and advisers have made a habit of showing him only positive polls to cheer him up, Politico reports. Aides and advisers cited in the report said they show him polls “designed to make him feel good,” usually those that focus solely on his base. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Trump adviser, said the president is still “in campaign mode” and closely tracks his polling numbers. “I think he's never really kind of gotten out of campaign mode and I thought he might,” Christie was cited as saying. Several senior aides and advisers said the Trump administration only becomes concerned when support slips in his base, while another official said public pollsters are often seen as “not understanding him.” Two other White House officials cited in the report said the strategy of focusing exclusively on polling numbers in Trump's base was “just not accurate” and producing “delusional” ideas about the president's support.
The Brisbane Lions today announced the appointment of Jed Adcock as the Club's Captain for 2014.
Adcock, who was last year inducted as a Life Member of the Club, will take the reigns as sole Captain having previously shared the captaincy duties with Jonathan Brown in 2013.
Midfielder Tom Rockliff was also unveiled as the Club's Vice-Captain, whilst Daniel Rich, Joel Patfull and Daniel Merrett will take up roles as Deputy Vice Captains.
The structure was finalised earlier this week during a leadership conference in Noosa involving core Senior players.
Senior Coach Justin Leppitsch said that the new leadership model was a good fit for the Club.
“Jed has demonstrated outstanding leadership over his time at the Lions, and most specifically last season as a Co-Captain,” Leppitsch said.
“He is an excellent representative of this footy Club, and it's culture and values. Jed is a great on-field leader, but just as importantly he sets a great example off it too.
“Whilst we'd love to have Browny around forever, that's just not possible and by him standing down from the Captaincy, it provides us with a great opportunity to develop our emerging leaders.
“It is also a fantastic opportunity for Tom Rockliff as Vice-Captain, at just 23 years of age, to really step up and continue to grow as a leader.”
Jonathan Brown said that he was excited to watch the Lions new crop of leaders develop.
“Obviously I have relished my time as Captain, but I think it's the right time for a changing of the guard,” said Brown.
“I'm coming towards the end of my career and I think with Leppa on board it's the perfect time for a fresh start.
“I'll still be there to support the boys when they need, but I have every confidence in the ability of Jed, Tom and our next generation of leaders to take the Club forward."
The Lions extended Leadership Group is made up by Pearce Hanley, Matthew Leuenberger, Dayne Zorko, Jack Redden and Mitch Golby.
These ghostly figures you see in these photographs weren't Photoshopped in, but are purely done through light painting. If you remember the creative 3D light painting technique using an iPad that we shared a while back, Croix Gagnon and Frank Schott took it a step further and put a slightly morbid twist on it. For their project “12:31“, they “painted” using a laptop and an animation showing cross-sections of a human body!
Here's how the photographs were created:
[The animation used] represents the entire data set (1,871 slices) of the male cadaver from the Visible Human Project. The animation was played fullscreen on a computer, which was moved around by an assistant while being photographed in a dark environment. The resulting images are long-exposure “light paintings” of the entire cadaver. Variations in the movement of the computer during each exposure created differences in the shape of the body throughout the series. [#]
This is the actual animation used for the light painting (you can full screen it and do you own photos with it):
If you could freeze the scene in the middle of one of their exposures, this is what it might look like:
What are people going to think of next for computer-aided light painting?

The Obama Administration's intention to expand antitrust enforcement appears to be continuing apace, as a number of reports are describing the opening of a new investigation, one that targets a variety of high-tech companies in California's Bay Area. This time around, however, the target isn't anticompetitive behavior in the consumer market. Instead, the Department of Justice has apparently opened an investigation of whether the companies are colluding in the process of hiring, distorting the market for their employees by forging agreements not to recruit from other, similar ventures.
In recent years, there have been a number of high-profile fights involving companies that have lured away an employee of a competing firm. In the cases that have made their way to court, such as Google-Microsoft and Apple-IBM, the employee was subject to a noncompete contract clause, and the legal battle focused on whether the work for the employee's new company actually involved competing with their former one. All of the companies listed as targets of the new investigation, however, are based in California—that state's Supreme Court declared that noncompete clauses violated state employment law, and were void within its boundaries.
All of the reports of the matter appear to trace back to two sets of sources; some spoke to The Washington Post, while others talked to a subscription site run by TheDeal.com. They could, in fact, have been the same sources speaking twice, since the stories seem to have complete agreement regarding the details of the investigation. Several major high-tech companies are said to be involved, including Apple, Google, and Yahoo, although the source indicated that the inquiry would be "industry wide."
The odd man out in the investigation is Genentech. Prior to a recent agreement that will see it folded into the pharmaceutical giant Roche, Genentech was one of the largest publicly traded biotechnology companies. The biotech job market in the Bay Area tends to be very fluid, with many employees moving around as a steady stream of startups either fold or get purchased by larger concerns. Unlike the other firms, which could largely forge agreements among themselves, there's no obvious candidate for Genentech to to have colluded with, which does suggest that the inquiry will ultimately spread well beyond the Bay Area.
In any case, the investigation is likely to be a challenging one. It's pretty unlikely that any agreements of the sort were ever formally committed to paper, which would mean that any legal action that resulted would ultimately rely on retained emails or personal testimony. Cases of that sort have been successfully pursued, but they tend to be more challenging, since it can be difficult to establish whether an employee's words reflected official company policy.
One possibility is that the DOJ isn't pursuing the investigation with the expectation that it will ultimately lead to legal action. The administration could simply intend to signal to companies that it is watching, and count on the threat that a business' hiring practices would be subject to extended legal oversight to be sufficient to restrain anticompetitive practices.
Our earliest laughs inevitably predate our first favorite books by a few years. Long before we understand the words inside a volume of The Boxcar Children or any Dr. Seuss book, some adult will do something silly that will make us giggle, even though we might not totally understand why. In a lot of cases, what we read — or what people read to us — can make us laugh just as much. And it's children, more than adults, who are expected to want literature that makes them laugh. You don't hear a lot of 20-somethings saying they're buying a novel because they heard it was hilarious, yet there is no shortage of funny highbrow literature, and a lot of humorous writing that should be read with the same critical eye as some of our greatest “serious” short stories and novels – assuming you can read while cracking up.
One such book is Jack Handey's new novel, The Stench of Honolulu.“I wanted to put the ‘Deep Thoughts' character out in the field, to see what kind of damage he could do — just out of curiosity,” he tells me. If you've paid attention to comedy in the last three decades, you're probably already familiar with Handey — his “Deep Thoughts” have been featured in two of America's most venerable humor institutions, National Lampoon and Saturday Night Live. He is revered in comedy writing circles as one of the best of the best, but the guy responsible for the famous “Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer” Saturday Night Live skit has also written a great novel that might go unnoticed by people who look down their noses at funny books.
And that's a shame, because The Stench of Honolulu, Handey's first novel and seventh book overall, is well worth reading. Its clean and clever story follows a very unreliable narrator who sees his time spent on the tropical wonderland of our 50th state as an adventure on a mysterious backwater island. The book is a short and easy read, and, of course, it's hilarious. Think Ignatius C. Reilly from A Confederacy of Dunces if he believed himself to be Indiana Jones, but filtered through Handey's unique voice.
Inevitably, the book comes with blurbs from comedy royalty like Judd Apatow and Jimmy Fallon. But lit snobs would do well to pay attention to a third blurb that proclaims, “Jack Handey is the funniest writer in America.” Situated above both Apatow's and Fallon's, it could come from another comedy writing god like Tina Fey or Woody Allen, but it doesn't; the blurb comes from George Saunders.
“George Saunders is a great, funny writer,” Handey tells me. His endorsement of the author of the recent critically acclaimed short story collection Tenth of December could come off as a, “You call me really funny and I'll call you the same” sort of deal, but it isn't — because aside from being one of the best and most respected writers around, George Saunders is also truly funny.
But Handey is no fiction connoisseur.“I don't read a lot of fiction,” he tells me. “Mostly non-fiction. I just read two excellent biographies of Stalin by Simon Sebag Montefiore.” And then he delivers something close to a “Deep Thought”: “Stalin was a barrel of laughs.”
There have been plenty of great writers who bridged the gap between literature and humor, although they're usually seen more than humorists than canonic authors: Nora Ephron, Fran Lebowitz, and David Sedaris are a few of the names that come to mind. S.J. Perelman, who is best known for his work co-writing the scripts to two Marx Brothers films, Monkey Business and Horse Feathers, is another writer who gets squirreled into this category. Although Perelman's work earned more than its share of laughs, he personally saw his style falling somewhere between James Joyce and the man he considered his rival, the British writer P.G. Wodehouse. Perelman hated seeing his work labeled as humor writing, rather than literature, especially considering that Wodehouse's stories continue to be lauded as brilliant books that simply happened to be really funny. Being a great writer who is also hilarious can also mean that your persona outshines your prose: Dorothy Parker wrote fantastic stories that were often funny, yet she's most remembered for being the life of the party.
Perhaps the larger problem is that we still have trouble viewing comedy as a legitimate art form (see also: major movie awards consistently overlooking comedy films), and that strange exclusion can explain the literary establishment's lack of interest in the humorous novel. But are things changing? Are we finally moving towards a world where you can laugh while reading a novel?
Interest in comedic literature was reignited a few years ago with the release of Sam Lipsyte's brilliant novel The Ask, when Lipsyte's then-editor, Lorin Stein (now at the helm at The Paris Review), opened the book's press release with the following sentence: “A generation ago, there was no shame in a book's being funny.” Stein went on to list “Joseph Heller, Thomas Pynchon, Stanley Elkin, Barry Hannah, the Roth of Portnoy's Complaint, the DeLillo of End Zone, etc., etc.” as examples of the strain of humor running through books written by writers born around the time of the Second World War. He lamented that novels of that kind have become less and less popular in the last few decades, citing Lipsyte's book (one of the best book's of the last decade in this writer's opinion) as a more than adequate corrective.
Whether Stein was being sincere or just trying to make a provocative statement about the decline of funny novels to sell a funny novel, I've noticed that in the last few years, funny literary writers are getting more attention. All of Gary Shteyngart's books, Adam Wilson's Flatscreen, Seth Fried's The Great Frustrations, The Miniature Wife by Manuel Gonzales, and a book that will likely top my 2013 best of list, Fiona Maazel's Woke Up Lonely, all offer plenty of laugh-out-loud lines. These books may not have much in common with your standard dumbed-down Comedy Central special — Maazel's features a cult that promises to cure loneliness in the 21st century, and Wilson's is filled to the brim with masturbation and drug use — but depending on your sense of humor, you're likely to laugh a few times as you read each of them.
Ultimately, what comedy and literature share is the aim of pushing readers' and audiences' boundaries for the sake of pleasure. It's probably why you hear Lenny Bruce's name so often mentioned in the same breath as the Beat writers, and why a book like Portnoy's Complaint, in which the main character masturbates into a piece of meat, can be considered a Great American Novel. But this overlap is just as pronounced in the work of comedians like Hannibal Buress; when you strip away the “comedian” title, the guy is a really hilarious storyteller (not to mention one who also happens to be a great comedy writer).
Humor has, in fact, always been central to literature: Shakespeare wrote comedies, Mark Twain was America's first great humorist, and Steve Martin has a few really good books to his name. But although I've read books and paid attention to comedy in equal doses throughout my life, I've noticed is that while comedy can be a career, being a funny literary writer has a shorter shelf life. Roth's books haven't been funny for years, and 1985's White Noise is the height of DeLillo's darkly hilarious writing; the same goes for Money by Martin Amis. When I mention this to Handey, and tell him I wonder why so many writers eventually lose their sense of humor, he recalls a quote from one of comedy's most literate stars, John Cleese: “To a civilian, a man slipping on a banana is funny. But to a comedy writer it has to be an old woman, falling into a manhole.”
Livio Suppo has declared that Honda aims to retain the services of Dani Pedrosa, whose current contract expires at the end of 2014.
Pedrosa has raced with Repsol Honda Team since he stepped up to the MotoGP™ premier class at the start of 2006, having also taken the majority of the manufacturer's 100 Grand Prix victories since the four-stroke era began in 2002.
With reigning World Champion Marc Marquez having in May extended his Honda contract until at least the end of 2016, Pedrosa is yet to put pen to paper.
“For sure, we will speak with Alberto (Puig, manager to Dani Pedrosa),” Suppo explains. “Of course, the priority for Dani is to remain here and the priority for Honda is to keep him here – and that is what we have to do. Now we will go ahead, but there is no rush.”
In Barcelona last Sunday, Pedrosa came extremely close to winning for the first time this year, but dropped to third place following contact with Marquez on the final lap.

First of all, I'm from Panama and it's a little pain in the butt to send something to me (last year ss arrived in March, and arbitrary day gift never got here).
My santa was this amazing person from Australia, who was very concerned and worried about my gift and the way of getting it delivered to me.
My santa apologized for the "not so original gift" and sent me a very thoughtful message and with it my gift: An Amazon Gift Card with a very generous amount. I know for many it will not be the best or the most original, but I really am very very grateful for this.
As I want to post my gift as soon as posible, and with christmas very close, I decided instead of a physical item, to buy PSN store credits, to get a game I was wishing a lot to get.
So here I am, with my new digital copy of Overwatch, and thanks to /u/tezmar and /u/CreepingDeath1 from /r/PS4 for helping me get a discount code, so I could get another game too!
Merry christmas to you all and to my secret santa I hope your holidays will be so special as you made mine.
PS. Sorry for the shitty english, yo ser latino. Also, Overwatch players add me at PSN: I'm FJM182.
Afghanistan is at a "critical juncture" that requires the Obama administration to consider backing off its plan to pull all U.S. forces out by the end of 2016, the commander of U.S. troops there told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday.
Under questioning by lawmakers, Gen. John Campbell was careful not to preempt President Obama's expected decision on whether to change the plan and would not specify the options he's presented to the White House for consideration.
But he did note that since the current plan was created in 2014, conditions on the ground had changed, including the election of a new Afghan government, stepped-up attempts by the Taliban to regain control and the appearance of the Islamic State on the Afghan battlefield.
When asked by Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, whether he thought the plan should be changed, Campbell replied: 'Yes, sir."
He also said Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani has asked coalition forces to remain in Afghanistan beyond 2016 to give his government more time to build stability.
"The Afghans welcome the opportunity to shape their destiny, but they still desire, need and deserve our assistance," Campbell said.
Though Afghan forces have fought well and were continuing to hold their ground this year, the Taliban takeover of the northern provincial capital of Kunduz highlighted their continuing shortcomings in the areas of intelligence, special operations and close air support, Campbell said.
"The Afghan security forces' inconsistent performance in this fighting season also underscores that their shortfalls will persist well beyond this year," he said.
Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., who has been pressing Obama for months to abandon his withdrawal timetable, said the administration's plan "would invite the same tragedy that has unfolded in Iraq since 2011.
"It is not too late for President Obama to abandon this dangerous course and adopt a plan for U.S. troop presence based on conditions on the ground. But time is of the essence, and continued delays by the White House are hurting our national security interests and those of our partners in Afghanistan and beyond," he said.
"America's friends and foes alike are waiting on President Obama."
The U.S. has 9,800 troops in Afghanistan, of which 6,800 are part of the 13,000-strong NATO mission to train and advise Afghan forces. The others are focused on counterterrorism.
The administration has resisted calls by Republican lawmakers to slow or halt its withdrawal plan, but the Washington Post reported Monday that Obama is seriously considering a recommendation by Gen. Martin Dempsey, the former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, to keep up to 5,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan beyond 2016.
On Monday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest would not confirm the report when asked about it or say when a decision would be announced. But Defense Secretary Ash Carter, in a news conference in Madrid with Spanish Defense Minister Pedro Morenes, said he expected Obama to decide this fall.
"I don't know what the president's final decisions will be, what decisions he'll make in that regard, but we continue to give him options," Carter said. "But I think the fundamental thing I want to stress is that there will be a U.S. presence and there will be a NATO presence in Afghanistan after 2016, no doubt about that. And there will be support to Afghan security forces as well."
Gov. Kate Brown on Thursday made the first move in a looming, months-long chess game over Oregon's finances, putting forth a mix of new revenues and "unacceptable" cuts to close a $1.7 billion budget gap normally seen in the throes of a recession.
Brown presented her $20.8 billion budget -- her first since taking office in 2015 -- at a muted news conference in the Capitol. It comes weeks after the crushing defeat of Measure 97, which would have raised $3 billion a year and erased a shortfall largely opened by spending on health care and public employee pensions.
Instead, her plan seeks just $897 million in new revenue in 2017-19, mostly by raising taxes on tobacco, liquor, hospitals, insurers and some corporation owners' incomes. She would protect the state's K-12 schools from cuts. To do so, she would make deep cuts to some programs and hold back money sought by social services providers and universities, among others.
"This budget is a short-term solution, nothing more," she said. "It represents the beginning of a conversation, not the end."
That conversation will linger at least until the 2017 legislative session gavels to a close next summer. And its reverberations could last longer, with battles expected over pension reform, corporate taxes, and whether and how to limit state spending.
On Thursday, Brown's plan earned a cool reception from educators, business interests and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Democrats, who control the House and Senate, will lead on a final budget plan. But they'll need help from Republicans, whose support is required for the supermajority votes necessary to raise taxes.
"The governor made a lot of tough choices," said Sen. Richard Devlin, D-Tualatin, co-chair of the Legislature's budget-writing committee.
Top takeaways from Gov. Kate Brown's $20.8 billion budget proposal Gov. Kate Brown unveiled her first budget at a press conference in Salem on Thursday
Although Devlin agreed with Brown that Oregon's next budget can't be solved by cuts or new revenue alone, lawmakers will likely strike their own balance.
"The Legislature might make different choices," he said. "From my perspective, flat funding universities is not an option that we can realistically consider."
Republicans were more pointed, saying governors and lawmakers should have braced for the largest costs contributing to the shortfall years ago.
"We have known for years that Oregon was on an unsustainable fiscal path, yet our leaders continued to operate as if the bill would never come due," House Minority Leader Mike McLane, R-Powell Butte, said in a statement, calling on Democrats to "commit to having an honest conversation about our state's unsustainable rate of spending."
Senate Minority Leader Ted Ferrioli, R-John Day, merely called Brown's plan "a self-inflicted wound caused by years of Democrat overspending on the wrong priorities."
Business groups, meanwhile, plan to outline their own strategy at a summit in Portland on Monday. The Oregon Business Association suggested it might include revenue reform aimed at easing ups and downs in tax collections along with proposals to rein in long-term public pension and Medicaid costs.
"Oregon has spent far too long in the Band-Aid business," the group wrote, adding that "there is a much preferable route if we have the political confidence to take the road less traveled here in Oregon."
Though Brown supported Measure 97, which would have taxed certain businesses with at least $25 million in Oregon sales, she set her course on revenue in a slightly different direction.
Her increases in hospital assessments and insurer taxes are meant to provide health care coverage for every Oregon child. And she's proposing an 85-cent hike, for instance, in taxes levied on each pack of cigarettes sold in Oregon.
But Brown is risking another fight with businesses and Republicans over calls to end a corporate tax break passed in 2013, part of a so-called "grand bargain" meant to cut public pension costs and revamp tax laws. Pension reforms passed as part of that deal were already largely undone by the Supreme Court last year.
The tax break applied to certain types of companies structured to pass profits to owners and shareholders who would then report the cash as personal income. The idea was that business owners would save money if they were taxed at the state's lower corporate rate.
Brown's office argued it hasn't created new investments or jobs as intended.
"The idea was to encourage small business growth," said Legislative Revenue Officer Paul Warner. Legislative economists estimate keeping the tax cut would cost the state roughly $200 million over the next budget.
Among cuts, Brown has proposed closing the Junction City state psychiatric hospital, which opened in 2015, along a youth correctional facility in Clatsop County.
She's also called for cutting funding for community-based developmental disability programs, which would affect the services they deliver to clients. And she would eliminate a program that provides health-care information to families with children who have special medical needs. Other cuts would target wildland firefighting and energy tax credits.
Community college and public universities would receive less funding than requested -- forcing them to cut back or raise tuition to cover rising costs and enrollment.
"These cuts are a level that I find absolutely unacceptable," Brown said. "State needs are growing, but state resources are not keeping pace with the needs."
Proposed spending for K-12 education would be "held harmless," said Kristen Grainger, Brown's communication director, meaning Brown would cover all expected cost increases, including rising pension costs. The state would pump $8 billion into elementary and secondary education, if legislators agree next year.
That would mark an increase from the $7.4 billion contained in the state's 2015-17 budget. But the increase is intended to cover the higher costs of employee pay and benefits, including much higher payments to the state pension system, not to add or expand programs or services.
On top of that, Brown called on lawmakers to fund programs designed to boost high school graduation rates, overwhelmingly approved last month under Measure 98.
But she recommended allocating just $139 million -- not quite half of the $294 million, or $800 per student, outlined in the measure.
Education advocacy groups expressed dissatisfaction with Brown's plan, with advocates of preschool, public schools and public universities all saying their sectors need more.
The Oregon School Boards Association predicted schools would face big cuts in staffing and services unless they get $500 million more.
University presidents decried almost certain tuition hikes. And preschool advocates said Oregon will never fix its achievement gaps and dropout epidemic with so many low-income children still shut out from Head Start and public preschools.
Hanna Vaandering, president of Oregon's powerful teachers union, said her group and others that backed Measure 97 will continue to push for tax increases.
"As the governor says, the budget is not adequate to provide for students across the state," Vaandering said. "It is going to take all of us working together and being honest, being honest that we have a revenue problem."
On the other hand, the governor has proposed borrowing $350 million to help with facilities projects at the state's colleges and universities. That effort includes borrowing $15 million in debt for campus security upgrades in the wake of the October 2015 shootings at Roseburg's Umpqua Community College.
She would expand Oregon Opportunity Grants, aimed at helping the state's neediest post-secondary students, with an aim of providing financial assistance to an additional 5,000 students.
She'd also preserve the Oregon Promise program, which lets high school students with high enough grades attend one of the state's nine community colleges for as little as $50 per semester.
Elements of a transportation-funding package expected to be a prime source of haggling and controversy in the 2017 session are not contained in Brown's budget. Those, Grainger said, will be included in separate legislation next year.
The budget also calls for borrowing money to jump start clean-up activities along the Willamette River in Portland, part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund project.
Lawmakers and business groups won't wait long to start plotting their counter moves.
"It will definitely prompt debate and it should," said Senate President Peter Courtney, D-Salem. " The process doesn't end today. It is just beginning."
And revenue discussions are expected to loom large.
House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland, said in a statement that Oregon's shortfall has its roots in property tax cuts stretching back decades.
"Oregon's budget is built upon an insufficient revenue structure that stretches back 25 years," Kotek said, saying she'd work with Brown to "build a budget that maintains positive momentum for Oregonians."

After decades of unregulated existence in all 50 states, the booming field of personal trainers is braced for a wave of scrutiny that is expected to transform the industry and could make or break some of the biggest fitness companies in the country.
The new regulations, being written by and for the nation's capital city, will create a registry of all personal trainers in the District only. But they are expected to become a model that winners and losers in the fight believe will be replicated elsewhere.
The credit — or blame — for the newfound urgency can be traced in part to President Obama's Affordable Care Act. A variety of workplace wellness programs and preventive health-care initiatives called for in the law could soon translate into rivers of billable hours for those with credentials to keep American waistlines in check.
And that means the race is on to be eligible for those credentials, which could eventually lead to the ability to bill insurance companies for services, much like such professionals as dieticians and physical therapists. With billions of dollars potentially at stake, lawyers and lobbyists are engaged in a no-holds-barred fight to shape the nation's first-ever rules over who has the right to tell someone else how to exercise.
The problem for personal trainers is that no standards currently exist. Instead, dozens of competing descriptions have been written by gym owners, for-profit training companies and self-proclaimed fitness experts. There are even competing organizations that certify competing tests.

Grappling with all of that, an obscure group of D.C. regulators — the Board of Physical Therapy — is preparing to release rules that could send a shock wave through the American fitness industry. Fearing the outcome, some of the loudest voices in the field have decided to go on the offensive. They are calling the process into question and urging city lawmakers to pull back or even halt the effort with threats of drawn-out legal battles.
Some exercise specialists who work most closely with medical groups say the D.C. physical therapy board has an inherent conflict of interest and is trying to restrict professionals with whom their own industry is in direct competition. They point to draft language that could be construed as cutting out personal trainers from potentially billable future work.
And it gets worse, says CrossFit, which offers a brand of high-intensity workouts and asserts that it is the nation's largest chain of fitness facilities. The District, according to the company, has allowed itself to become a pawn in a bitter industry fight over which personal trainer certification will have the muscle of the law behind it. That could enrich some for-profit organizations and cost others dearly. CrossFit, an industry rebel with millions of devotees as well as critics who say its program leads to injury, says it could be hurt the most.
The tab for revamping CrossFit's training courses could run into the tens of millions of dollars if the company is forced to do so nationwide, says its chief executive.
For consumers in the District — and eventually Massachusetts and other states where registration or licensure is under debate — regulations could cause some gyms to close while owners and trainers obtain suitable certifications. Such state registries or licenses could also pervade preventive health-care programs. If an employer can get more credit for offering a certified lunchtime pilates program than for a calisthenics routine run by a rogue instructor from CrossFit, it could shape offerings that may suit the fitness needs of some consumers more than others.
“This will affect everyone because ‘fitness' is a nebulous term. That's why we have so many pathways to achieve it . . . we all respond differently to exercise and we all have different factors in our lives that come into play in trying to attain it,” said Phillip Godfrey, a medical exercise specialist in the District who has tracked the D.C. law for months and has become convinced the final product will be problematic for his livelihood.
“The term ‘personal fitness trainer' is not true for everyone in the industry,” Godfrey continued. “That's a known title, but there are kinesiologists, corrective specialists . . . literally hundreds of titles and sub-specialties. Setting one pathway, one test, one methodology to train individuals — that can be problematic. It may work for some and not others.”

Godfrey and others said that if the District wants to regulate the personal fitness industry, it should set up a board of personal trainers and academic experts rather than assigning the task to physical therapists.
New rules coming next month
Such concerns do not appear to be dissuading D.C. regulators.
Under a bill passed unanimously last year by the D.C. Council and signed into law by the mayor, the District's Board of Physical Therapy was tasked with writing the new regulations. The board plans to release its rules next month, seek public comment and then publish them as law. And the heat is on: The District is behind in the process ordered in the legislation. By a strict reading of the law, no personal trainer is operating legally in the nation's capital because the deadline to register has passed.
The uncertainty over the coming rules is weighing heavily on many who make their living in the industry, especially through CrossFit, which has thrived in a heretofore unregulated space.
With a single weekend course, would-be CrossFit instructors can become certified by the company to open a gym, also known as a “box.”
Using that model, CrossFit has more than 13,000 affiliate facilities, with, reportedly, one opening somewhere in the world every two hours.
The largest concentration of CrossFit facilities is in the Washington area, which the American College of Sports Medicine recently dubbed America's fittest city.
Andrew Killion, a former collegiate boxer at Cornell and a rower at Gonzaga College High School, found an unexpected career with Crossfit — and is sweating out the District's impending regulations.
Killion was a paralegal quickly growing disillusioned with a prospective career in law when he opened a CrossFit in the District in 2010. He has since moved twice into bigger spaces. He has nearly 400 members and a hall of fame of three clients who have lost more than 100 pounds each.
On a recent afternoon, Killion paced the sprawling floor of his CrossFit gym near Nationals Park, correcting members' spinal posture during dead lifts. There's no difference between safety and performance, he said; the correct form will provide both.
“If there is a board declaring what is good, what is bad, who is right and who is wrong, they are effectively assigning what you are liable for and what you're not liable for from an insurance standpoint . . . and my rates could go through the roof,” Killion said. “But what is in the realm of good training and what is not is very much up for debate.”
One early proposal that the D.C. board discussed but appears to have moved away from would have required personal trainers to have as much as a four-year degree. Killion said that if such a rule were adopted, he almost certainly wouldn't have abandoned a career in law.
“I would have never been able to start my business, and we wouldn't have people who have lost 100 pounds if that were the case,” he said.
CrossFit and its rivals
Layered into the D.C. regulatory fight is a battle between CrossFit and a consortium of established sports medicine organizations that have banded together under the title of the Coalition for Registration of Exercise Professionals.
The coalition has created a national registry of personal trainers to list and verify credentials. It has attracted at least 150,000 trainers — more than half of all those thought to use the title nationwide.
Graham Melstrand, president of the board, has been among the few voicing strong support for the District's effort.
“First and foremost, the purpose of the law is to enhance consumer protection for the residents of the District of Columbia,” he said. Melstrand said industry estimates show 40 percent of all trainers have no gym affiliation, meaning they are accountable to no one even though they are often in positions of authority with clients.
That was part of the rationale that Senora Simpson, chairwoman of the D.C. board and a physical therapist, cited in pushing for her board to have the power to regulate personal trainers.
“We all have heard anecdotal reports of injuries, sexual misconduct and misrepresentation of titles by persons claiming to be competent in that area,” Simpson testified before a D.C. Council committee. She called the lack of any registration or licensure of personal trainers “a nationwide failure.”
For CrossFit and the coalition, a primary question is which credentialing the board will recognize. The two use different organizations to certify their trainee programs.
Greg Glassman, CrossFit's chief executive, bristles at that measurement, saying his organization has been validated in other important ways. CrossFit programs have been adopted as in-house workout routines by several military Special Operations forces and police departments, he said.
“This has nothing to do with public safety or public health,” Glassman said of the District's proposed regulations during a recent trip to lobby city officials not to impede his company.
CrossFit has homed in on statements by Simpson that the board began consulting with members of the coalition about proposed standards more than five years ago. He cast the legislation as a “Hail Mary pass” by those organizations to prevent the loss of customers to CrossFit.
After a meeting between Glassman and a deputy mayor for health, a spokesman for Mayor Muriel E. Bowser, Michael Czin, said in an e-mail statement that the administration is “committed to developing thoughtful regulations that protect residents' safety and health while creating an environment where businesses thrive.”
“We will continue to work with all stakeholders to develop the rules.”
Melstrand said the issue is bigger than concerns about CrossFit. It's about finding ways for the profession of personal trainers to mature into more respected health-care roles.
“At the end of the day, all of the fitness organizations are looking for the respect of practitioners,” he said. “As our space is maturing, there have to be greater expectations around the people who are practicing our craft.”
UPDATE: International reunion tour announced!
When the 2017 lineup for LA's FYF Fest was announced, one of its most surprising and exciting inclusions was another reunion of Cap'n Jazz, the influential emo band whose members went on to form American Football, Owen, Owls, Joan of Arc, The Promise Ring, Maritime, and more. We wondered if that would be their only show of 2017, and fortunately, it isn't.
The band also play the first-ever Chicago installment of the free summer shows at House of Vans, which is also presented by FYF. Their show is on July 29, one week after FYF Fest, and it's with the great Philly band Hop Along (who also opened the Owls reunion tour). RSVP opens on July 17 at 10 AM EST.
Fingers crossed for a Cap'n Jazz show on the east coast! Meanwhile, stream their classic discography compilation, Analphabetapolothology:
While Donald LeBuhn was filing a class action lawsuit against Apple back in January of this year, accusing the company of misleading customers as to the strength of the glass used in its iPhone 4, Apple was already well into inventing new crack resistant glass solutions for portables like the iPhone. The new solution involves a tunable shock mount that sits between the glass and the body of the device. The specialized mount could be instantly inflated if the device senses a drop event determined by its internal accelerometer. Apple's patent describes using exotic materials that could protect the glass from shattering. As a side bonus, Apple is also considering a solution that could provide portable devices with a new water damage prevention seal. Two Updates have been added to this report
The Problem: Portables are Susceptible to Cracked Glass
Conventionally, small form factor devices, such as handheld electronic devices, have a display arrangement that includes various layers. The various layers usually include at least a display technology layer, and may additionally include a sensing arrangement and/or a cover window disposed over the display technology layer.
The cover window, or glass cover, for a small form factor device could be made of plastic or glass. Plastic is durable but susceptible to being scratched. Glass is scratch resistant, but brittle. The rigid nature of glass makes it susceptible to cracking if subjected to significant forces. For example, users of handheld electronic devices occasionally drop their device onto a floor or other hard surface, and the resulting impact forces could cause the glass to crack.
In general, the thicker the glass, the stronger it is. Unfortunately, however, with low profile handheld devices, the glass cover is often relatively thin, and tends to be susceptible to damage when the small form factor device is stressed as, for example, when dropped onto a floor. Here, the glass cover may crack or break as a result of being dropped onto the floor. As handheld electronic devices become thinner, the glass cover sheets used on the handheld electronic devices typically also becomes thinner and, thus, more susceptible to damage.
Thus, there is a continuing need for improved approaches for glass cover arrangements for electronic devices that are configured to avoid unnecessary damage.
Apple's Proposed Solution: Integrating a Shock Mount into Devices
Apple's invention patent covers apparatus, systems and methods for shock mounting a cover glass for an electronic device. In one embodiment, a method for assembling an electronic device could include at least providing a housing for an electronic device, and compliantly attaching a cover glass to at least a portion of one surface of the housing, whereby cover glass serves as an outer surface for the at least a portion of one surface of the housing.
In one embodiment, a consumer electronic device could include a cover glass, and a shock mount disposed between the cover glass and a remaining mass of the electronic device. The shock mount is configured to isolate the cover glass from the remaining mass of the electronic device.
The apparatus, systems and methods for shock mounting glass are well suited for cover glasses or displays (e.g., LCD displays) assembled in small form factor electronic devices such as the iPhone, iPod Touch or remote controllers. Yet it is the invention also may apply to the iMac, Cinema Display, the iPad, MacBook and televisions.
Sensing Drop Events & Implementing a Mechanically Actuated Retractable
In another embodiment, a consumer electronic device could include a housing, a cover glass provided adjacent to at least one surface of the housing, and electrical components provided at least partially internal to the housing. The electrical components include at least a controller, a memory, a display, a sensor, and an actuator. At least the controller and the sensor are used to sense a drop event. The actuator could be coupled with the cover glass for withdrawing the cover glass at least partially into the housing in response to sensing the drop event, thereby protecting for the cover glass. Elsewhere in the patent Apple describes this as a "mechanically actuated retractable."
Water Seal
Apple states that another advantage to their invention is that electronics disposed within a housing of a device could be protected from water damage by using a water seal.
The Tunable Shock Mount
Notably in patent FIG. 1A, the electronic device has a cover glass (104) with a tunable shock mount (105) which could be disposed between the cover glass and the housing (102).
Considering that the thickness of the cover glass could be rather thin (i.e., less than a few millimeters), the cover glass if not carefully arranged could be susceptible to cracking or breaking in an accidental drop event. Therefore the cover glass could be suitably arranged with the tunable shock mount noted above which could be tuned so as to limit susceptibility to damage.
The tunable shock mount may be disposed between the cover glass and the main body of the device. As particularly shown above in sequential end views of the electronic device before a shock event in FIG. 1B, and after a shock event in FIG. 1C, the tunable shock mount could provide compression and dampening, so as to isolate the cover glass from the remaining mass of the electronic device.
The cover glass has a substantially planar surface, and the tunable shock mount is arranged so as to provide compression and dampening along a direction normal to the planar surface of the cover glass (for illustrative purposes in FIG. 1C, the direction normal to the planar surface is shown by a notional arrow with the legend "N").
In response to such shock events, the cover glass could resonate. The cover glass could have a corresponding resonant frequency. Similarly, the remaining mass of the electronic device could have a corresponding resonant frequency. The tunable shock mount could be tuned to have a resonant frequency that is substantially lower than the resonant frequencies of the cover glass and the remaining mass of the electronic device. Additionally, the tunable shock mount could be tuned so as to be substantially critically damped.
Strengthening the Glass
One aspect of this invention has already been put into place on iOS devices. The invention describes using alumino silicate glass which is commercially known as Gorilla Glass. But other glass materials that could be used in the future include sodalime and borosilicate that are known to make the glass resistant to thermal shock.
Moreover, the cover glass pieces can be chemically treated for further strengthening. One suitable chemical treatment is to place the cover glass pieces in a chemical bath containing potassium (e.g., KNO.sub.3) for a period of time (e.g., several hours) at an elevated temperature. The chemical treatment could desirably result in higher compression stresses at the surface of the cover glass pieces. The surface of the cover glass pieces includes the edges of the cover glass pieces. The higher compression stresses may be the result of K+ ions effectively replacing some Na+ ions at or near the surface of the cover glass.
Update # 1 Nov 18, 2011 4:44 PM MST: I've heard some people denigrating Apple by saying that Apple's use of old technology like Gorilla Glass for the iPod is a rip off and other such nonsense. The fact is, that on page 472 of Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs pertaining to Gorilla Glass, we read Corning's CEO Wendell Weeks state that "we produced a glass that had never been made." Furthermore he stated "We put our best scientists and engineers on it, and we just made it work." All in context with the iPhone. The fomula of the original Gorilla glass wasn't what ended up in the iPhone. So even though Corning has kept the "Gorilla Glass" branding, we now know that the iPhone ended up with their all new formula which revived the product that Corning had no original market for.
The Material Makeup of the Tunable Shock Mount
A material of the tunable shock mount (205) may include a polymer, a foam, a gel, a viscoelastic material, a shape memory material, an exothermic material, an optically transparent material, a silicone rubber material or other suitable material. Depending in part upon the material or materials selected for the tunable shock mount, and upon parameters such as compressive stiffness and/or dampening of such material or materials, dimensions of the tunable shock mount such as a width dimension "w" and/or a thickness dimension "t" shown in cross-sectional views in FIGS. 2B and 2C may be selected so as to provide tuning.
Apple's reference to "shape memory material" may very well relate to another patent of theirs that surfaced back in June 2010. Our patent report on this subject matter described likeminded properties under the header "Shape Shifter Nodes and Materials."
A Tunable Shock Mount with Micro Inflatable Bladder
Apple's patent FIG. 5 shows a housing and a cover glass in cross sectional view having a tunable shock mount 505 disposed there between. The tunable shock mount could comprise of an inflatable bladder 506 filled with a fluid 507. Tuning could be done in various ways such as by selection of materials for the bladder and fluid, and by varying an amount of inflation. Hmm, think of it as a form of air-bag for portable devices.
Apple's patent applicationwas originally filed in Q2 2010. One of the inventors named in the patent is Stephen Lynch who has worked on such projects as the iPod touch and wireless inductive charging.
Update #2 November 28, 2011: Apple gained a new round of design patents from China today. Of interest is one design that illustrates a raised rim. This might, and I stress might, be illustrating another protective measure being considered by Apple to protect the iPhone's Glass face. Time will tell.

Hello there, I haven't posted here in a long time, but I find you guys are the best audience. but BEWARE: WALL OF TEXT. READ AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.
TL;DR: Southern girl is racist towards me, and hates my guts because I am Asian. I see her in store after high school, she asks me out. I am confused, but go out with her anyway. We have a great time, I eat fried chicken, we have kissy kissy time. End of story.
I am 18 years old (I think my profile age may be older, but I am 18) and just graduated from high school. When I started my last year of high school a little less than a year ago, we had this transfer student from Alabama or Louisiana (I cant remember) who came to Canada for some unknown reason but was moving back home after the school year and summer was over. Now, let me say one thing, I do not think the majority of people from the south are racist, and those stereotypes about them all being racist rednecks are garbage. In fact, I have met a few southerners and many of them are as kind and respectful as can be. But of course every society has their share of racists, and this girl is one of them.
This girl was in my second semester English class, and we had assigned seating in in alphabetical order by last name. My Last name begins with K, hers begins with M. Since there was no L in our class, she sat beside me. Now, I thought this was amazing at first. She was beautiful. Tall, blonde, blue eyes, etc. Not to mention I found her southern accent pretty sexy as well. Problem was...I had no idea she was racist. Now, being a half Asian male who looks predominantly Asian growing up in Canada, I have had my fair share of teasing, but no one has really, truly hated me because of what I look like.
So, when she sat next to me, she didn't look quite happy. But at this point, it was unknown to me that she was racist. The first thing I ever said to her was "Can I borrow a highlighter?" She calmly said "I dont lend things to Ch**ks". At that point, I was stunned, and didn't quite know what to do. I thought she may have been joking but I soon realized she was very serious. Th whole semester that we sat together, she wouldn't talk to me, try not to look at me etc. It's as if I was some kind of plague. She was good friends with the popular kids/jocks/preps (who are all white) so every chance she got, she would try and humiliate me. Her and her friends would walk by, and if I was eating a granola bar (chocolate marshmallow of course) she would say something along the line of "where's your bowl of rice yellow belly?" etc. I decided to take the high road, and just ignore her. (I took the high road because the jocks have about an extra 6" on me and 50-100 pounds, so in this case taking the high road = being a pussy)
I went to a few parties, and she ended up being there. I believe she wore a confederate shirt once. (It was really tight and and hot, but at the same time scared me. See, I told you I was a pussy.) The problem is, a lot of people liked her, because she was sexy. At these parties, she would usually get her and her large male friends to throw things at me, egg my beautiful 1995 Honda Civic DX (Just kidding :P), yell racist comments at me etc. So, I stopped going to these large parties where everyone was invited for the rest of the semester. The weird thing is, I have been to many parties during first semester, seen her there, and she did nothing. She did all this during second semester. Anyhow, I bend over and take this abuse for the rest of high school, high school ends, I graduate, blahblahblah.
So anyhow, about 2 weeks ago I see her in Wal-Mart. I tried to use my 1337 ninja skills to hide, but it was too late. She saw me. Damn. ****. Fu**. Bi**h. So, I kind of did this awkward look, and decided to walk away. She called my name, and i thought to myself " here was gone again...". She comes up to me, says hi, and asks me how my summer was etc. Very similar to the time when I first talked to her, I was in complete shock. At first, i thought she was joking. My mother always told me to be respectful, so instead of introducing my right hand to her face, I just kept on talking hoping it would end soon. (not too soon though, because I may or may not have been staring at her boobies a bit). Anyhow, i eventually zoned out a bit while talking to her. But i was conscious enough to hear this "So do you want to do something sometime?" I didn't quite know what to do, but I remember my voice cracking and me uttering to her something that sounded like a duck's quack. She said "What?" So I stupidly said "yes". She said "great", gave me her number, then we both went separate ways. This was beyond weird because the conversation we are casual, she didn't bring up anything bring up anything about my ethnicity, or what she did/said to me in the past. We had a normal conversation that would happen between two friends or something.
Anyhow, I drove home from Wal-Mart thinking this was a complete trick. I would call her, and she would destroy me with a continuous wave of racist comments, or we would go out, and she would do something to publicly embarrass me forever and I would end up like Yoda. Old, green, living in a cave, with the nearest girl being galaxies away. But, I decided to call her up, mainly because I was curious to see what the hell this was all about. We talked briefly, she said I could come over to her Aunt's house (that's where she was staying for the year, until she went back to The US). Last week, I went there. No one was home except for her. We talked, she cooked me a classic southern meal consisting of southern chicken, potatoes and a classic cheese cake dessert (At first I thought the meal was poisoned, but I kept eating it anyway because it was so damn delicious) The whole time, she never mentioned anything about my race, or anything she did to me. It's as if I instantly became the whitest man on Earth, and was no longer Asian. We had a great conversation, and while we were eating/talking, she kept on rubbing my arm a bit, giggling at every single joke I said, and playing with her hair. Basically, she was giving me signs. After dinner, I took her for a nice walk down by the beachfront(classic :P) at night. We talked even more, and then had kissed, which eventually turned into making out. I brought her home, we arranged another date, and now I am talking to you guys telling you this story. She is going back home in another month and a half or so, so we only have a little while to see each other. I just thought I would share this with you guys, and wondering if you could give me an opinion on the situation because I still cant believe it.
Be cool.
Chocolate Chip Pumpkin Bread! Made with pumpkin puree and warm fall spices, sprinkled with chocolate chips. Great for an afternoon snack with coffee!

Confession: I am a late bloomer when it comes to my love for pumpkin.
My mom doesn't really like pumpkin, so the only encounters that I had with it before adulthood were in the form of store-bought pumpkin pies in those crinkly aluminum tins topped with a dollop of partially frozen cool whip. Not exactly the tastiest introduction!
A Favorite Pumpkin Treat
Maybe it was fate, but I discovered my love of baking around the same time that a certain coffee chain debuted pumpkin spice to the masses. The two things inevitably collided and a late love of pumpkin baked goods was born!
These days, I tend to prefer pumpkin cakes, cookies, and breads over custardy pumpkin treats (too many bad childhood memories!). This chocolate chip pumpkin bread is a favorite.
Moist Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Bread
This is a super moist loaf with a bright orange, not-too-dense crumb. A sprinkle of mini chocolate chips in the batter creates a contrast between the sweet, tender crumb of the bread and almost bitter chocolate.
The barest hint of spice in the batter is amplified by the liberal coating of cinnamon sugar on top of the bread. This does double duty: it adds flavor and it turns into a crackly crust as the bread bakes (My tasters declared that as their favorite part.)
This bread keeps like a dream for at least a few days, wrapped well, on the countertop.
More Great Add-Ins for Pumpkin Bread
Try some of these other ideas instead of — or in addition to! — chocolate chips in your pumpkin bread:
Toasted, chopped nuts — walnuts, pecans, or hazelnuts
Butterscotch chips or cinnamon chips
Grated coconut — both mixed in and sprinkled over top
Chopped, fresh apples
Dried cranberries
Other Pumpkin Treats to Try!
In a special edition of his show, Bill O'Reilly continued Fox News' coverage of today's bombing at the Boston Marathon. Going off on the “cowardly attack,” O'Reilly offered a rundown of the facts before condemning the horrific incident. He was joined by Peter King, the Republican congressman from New York.
President Obama promised justice, the host noted, “but he made one mistake.” He “called the attack a tragedy,” O'Reilly said. “It was not. It was a vile act of violence, designed to kill innocent people, including children…This makes me sick.”
King added that “there's no doubt in my mind that this is a terrorist attack.” While we don't have all the facts, and officials haven't said who is responsible for the attack, King said we need to be looking at al Qaeda, or at least an offshoot of the organization.
Furthermore, the incident had the same m.o. as the 9/11 attacks, O'Reilly asserted — as King urged we use the attack as a wake-up to ensure we stay vigilant and aggressive in monitoring threats.
Not wanting to be “quibbling with the commander-in-chief,” O'Reilly later revisited his earlier point about the president's response to the situation. Obama “did his job today, and I trust that he will get to the bottom of it,” he said. “But it's not a tragedy. I mean, these are well thought out, military campaigns, directed against civilians. This is what the Nazis did.”
While it's absolutely a vile attack, as O'Reilly said, it's strange to say it's not also a tragedy.
Take a look at the segment below, via Fox News:
Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com
What Kennedy Space Centre is to spaceships, Honda's Research and Development Centre (R&D Centre) in Tochigi, Japan, is to the advancement of its automobiles. With the help of state-of-the-art research equipment, Honda's engineers conduct in-depth research in pursuit of their ultimate objective: bringing originality and leading edge technologies for use around the globe. The advances pioneered at this enormous facility play a key roll in the development of automobiles that are right for the time, right for the environment, and, perhaps more importantly in an ever more competitive market, right for the customer.
In March 2000, Honda expanded its horizons by adding a new crash-test facility to the existing structure. Generally, consumers take safety very seriously, and so to stay ahead of the times and the ever-changing regulations in automotive safety, Honda will conduct all future crash testing at this centre. The objective is to ensure continuity across the product range. Honda's research showed that the fixed-barrier collision testing is best suited to the evaluation of occupant restraint systems, including airbags, in cars of similar weight and little else. In light of these findings, Honda felt it necessary to conduct its own independent research into a vehicle's crashworthiness. This thinking precipitated the world's first indoor, Omni-Directional Crash-Test Facility.
At a cost of $90-million and with an impressive 41,000 square metres of floor space, this facility is designed for year-round operation, which ultimately reduces design and development time. Built into the floor of this laboratory are eight test tracks that are laid out in a spoke-like (radial) configuration. This setup allows Honda's engineers to simulate a variety of frontal, side and rear-end collisions in increments of 15-degrees from any direction, meaning everything between a head-on impact to a full sideswipe can be accommodated. The design is such that a wide range of operating parameters can be built into the research. But it goes beyond that, allowing a comprehensive range of collision profiles – such as two vehicles travelling at different speeds or two vehicles of different sizes (a passenger car and truck) to be fully evaluated. In addition, it can simulate and analyze collisions between automobiles and pedestrians.
According to one of Honda's top safety engineers, the knowledge of what really happens in real-life crashes is the foundation for designing and producing a safer car, one that offers the best protection for occupants in the passenger cell. The ultimate goal for the car-to-car crash tests is to replicate real-world situations. By performing these tests, Honda's engineers and researchers can accurately determine how its cars will function when the environment switches from a sterile test facility to the highways and byways around the world, as well as developing a true understanding of how human injuries occur. The results of these findings will lead to the development of new technologies designed to minimize the injuries resulting from a collision. It will also enable future products to not only meet current standards, but to take them to a level that should comply with future standards.
During the recent Tokyo Motor show, Honda invited a group of North American automotive journalists to its Tochigi R&D Centre, to observe a couple of crash tests first hand. One an offset head-on vehicle-to-vehicle crash, the other a vehicle-to-pedestrian collision.
The 50% offset frontal car-to-car crash test involved two cars from Honda of America's press fleet – a 2001, 4-door Civic and 2001 4-door Acura RL. Both cars were outfitted with two crash test-dummies – one in the driver's seat and the other in the front passenger seat. The Civic and its occupants weighed in at approximately 1,300 kg (2,866lbs) and was position at one end of the track. The RL and its passengers, weighing about 1,830kg (4,034lbs), was positioned at the other.
Both cars were accelerated by to speed using an in-floor propulsion unit down their respective tracks. Just before hitting each other at 50km/h, the cars were cut loose. Here the story gets a little bizarre. Rather than hearing the engines roaring and then the loud screech of brakes as the drivers realized the worst was about to happen, there's almost total silence. Only the echo from the clanking from the propulsion units, sounding very much like the noise as you enter a carwash, broke the hushed silence. However, when the two cars made contact the surreal world of a crash test facility was instantly shattered by that horrible noise you hear when cars collide. In little more than the blink of an eye, the two cars came to rest – both totaled!
The entire process – the loud explosion type of noise and flying debris that followed after the collision – was watched and monitored by a wide array of computers, sensors and cameras record the entire event. A thick plexi-glass stage below the impact zone houses the some of the cameras needed to examine what happens underneath as one car crushes into the other. Others cameras, mounted from every conceivable vantagepoint capture the exact moment, storing the data so that it can be reviewed at a later stage.
After clearing the dangerous debris out of the way, Honda allowed us to examine the wreckage. Looking at the aftermath, the airbags deployed as intended, saving the heads, faces and upper bodies of the dummies in both cars. The pair in the RL would have survived and probably walked away with hardly a mark. Only the driver in the Civic suffered any visible signs of injury. His left knee had impacted the lower dash area, causing it to break. While difficult to tell how severe the injury might have been, I came away thinking that he would have hobbled for a couple of days, and little more.
After experiencing, first-hand, the collision research that is ongoing at Honda's crash testing laboratory, I am certain that its engineers are on the right track in their approach to ensuring maximum passenger, pedestrian and vehicle safety. This could not have come at a more appropriate time, as according to the World Health Organization, road traffic accidents kill more than a million people a year, injuring another thirty-nine million (5 million of them seriously).
If this is an example of how future cars are going to survive a serious crash, I for one, feel much more comfortable about driving a smaller car. If something the size of a Civic can tangle with a significantly larger vehicle and allow the occupants to walk away, that has to be seen as a step in the right direction.
Rumors have cropped over the past month or so claiming that Verizon is about to launch another exclusive Android device, and is planning to add it to its well-known DROID range. The Droid Turbo – as it's being called – will allegedly feature a Quad HD display and fast-charging technology along with the usual long battery life. We're expecting “Big Red” to unveil it some point this month.
But it's not the only carrier that's going to be selling a variant of the device if this FCC filing is anything to go by. The listing reveals that a device, virtually identical to the “Turbo”, has been tested on LTE bands 2, 4, 5 and 17, making it a perfect GSM candidate for both T-Mobile and AT&T. Although it is a little disappointing that it doesn't have Banded 12 support.
As picked up by AndroidFace, Motorola claims in the filing that “the mobile device carrying FCC ID IHDT56PK2 is electrically equivalent to the certified device carrying FCC ID IHDT56PK1…”
Speculation surrounding the device predicts a phone with a 5.2-inch, 2560×1440 resolution display, 3GB RAM, 32GB internal storage and a quad-core Snapdragon 805 processor clocked at 2.65GHz. It's purported to feature a 20MP camera on the back, and run Android 4.4.4 out of the box.
As you'd expect, there's been no official word on the Droid Turbo from Motorola or Verizon. And if the new device does make use of VZW's “Droid” trademark, it's very unlikely that a GSM version will use the same moniker. The name “Moto X Play” has been rumored, but is by no means certain.
As with any rumor or FCC filing, there's a chance that it doesn't come through for T-Mobile. So take it with a pinch of salt.

The five women are (from left to right in the image above):
Margaret Hamilton: a computer scientist who developed the on-board flight software used for the Apollo missions to the moon. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom last year for being a coding pioneer.
Katherine Johnson: a physicist and mathematician who manually calculated trajectories and launch windows for many early NASA missions, including the 1969 Apollo 11 flight to the moon. She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015 and was portrayed by Taraji P. Henson in the movie Hidden Figures.
Sally Ride: an astronaut and physics professor who became the first American woman in space and the third overall, meaning she had to endure questions like: "Will the flight affect your reproductive organs?" She also remains the youngest American astronaut to ever travel to space at age 32. In 2001, she founded a company that created entertaining science programs and publications for elementary and middle school girls.
Nancy Grace Roman: is known as the "Mother of Hubble" for her work on the telescope and one of the first female NASA executives. She developed NASA's astronomy research program and was involved in the development and launch of six other space observatories and satellites
Mae Jemison: a medically-trained astronaut who became the first African-American woman to travel to space and orbit the planet. After a brief NASA career, she founded her own tech company and became a professor.
Weinstock told BBC that her purpose is to inspire girls to pursue careers in STEM: "I hope it sets a new example for both girls and boys," she said. "Girls, in that they can and should be engineers, scientists, and mathematicians, and boys, in that they internalise at an early age that these careers are for everyone, not only men."
Lego is now finalizing the characters' design. The company has no exact release date yet, but it expects to start selling the "Women of NASA" set in late 2017 or early 2018.
DULLES, Va. — The escape plan was carefully choreographed. On Friday, after a day of work, Representative Paul D. Ryan pretended to turn in for the night, walking through the front door of his home in Janesville, Wis.
He did not stay for long.
To elude reporters camped outside, he slipped out the back door with a suitcase and walked through the dense woods that surround his property. He exited on a nearby street, where an aide in a waiting car drove him to the airport.
His destination, the Republican ticket.
For the past 10 days, the Romney campaign took extraordinary measures to keep Mr. Ryan's whereabouts and movements a mystery. In the process, the campaign pulled off a rare feat in the era of the Twitter news cycle: Mr. Romney unveiled his vice-presidential pick on his own schedule, keeping his running mate's identity secret until a few hours before a rally in Norfolk, Va., on Saturday morning.
It required painstakingly planned skulduggery, which the campaign outlined in detail, late on Saturday afternoon.

“We gave a lot of thought on how to make this work undetected,” said Beth Myers, the Romney aide who oversaw the vice-presidential search.
The mystery was compared to the 1947 Roswell incident in New Mexico
In 1962, shepherd Donald McKenzie discovered something mysterious on a remote Scottish hillside.
What he didn't realise at the time was that he was witnessing what would become one of the biggest UFO mysteries in UK history.
He told police what he had seen, but they didn't take him seriously and started questioning the quality of his whisky.
However, three months later a team from the RAF went along and what they discovered left people scratching their heads for over 50 years.
The team uncovered a box that was big enough to hold a man, and with a camera port, and a brass plate offering a reward if it was found. There were also bottles of a clear liquid strewn on the ground nearby.

But what was most mysterious was a lack of scorch marks, no sign of impact damage, and there was no parachute.
The whole episode was compared to the Roswell incident when a ‘flying saucer flap' was discovered in New Mexico in 1947.
Finally that mystery has been solved thanks to some files uncovered at the National Archives in Kew.
Dr David Clarke will publish How UFOs Conquered the World later this month and he revealed that it may have been from a CIA spy programme called Moby Dick.
The structure would have been attached to a massive balloon and was designed to be carried across the planet at 60,000ft over Russia where it would take pictures of nuclear facilities.
The spy mission lasted until 1956 and the one found by Mr McKenzie is believed to have landed six years prior to its discovery.
Dr Clarke said: ‘The Pentagon had spent $68 million on the project and was determined to keep it a secret.'
A press release in one of the files, dated January 1956, even listed cover stories that would be given to the media if the balloons were shot down or captured.
‘It seemed highly likely that a similar story had been used at Roswell to protect Mogul.
‘The official line was that the devices were ‘part of an Air Force meteorological survey of the northern hemisphere'.'
Sheffield Hallam University academic Dr Clarke says the project was abandoned in 1956, when the CIA switched to manned reconnaissance flights using the U2 spy plane.

Insane Clown Posse (ICP), a horrorcore duo from Detroit, Michigan, usually elicits a strong reaction from fans and detractors alike. Love them or hate them, it is hard to deny their impact, whether it is the rich “Dark Carnival” mythology in their music, controversies and rivalries with other artists, or their impressive work ethic. Until recently, their annual music festival, Gathering of the Juggalos, was held at Cave-in-Rock, Illinois, an area noted for its own myths and legends. While their songs focus on themes like revenge, poverty, drugs, insanity, and violence, a number of them contain overtly supernatural themes. Mysterious Heartland has sorted through their catalog to bring you ICP's Top 10 Supernatural Songs. Which will prove to be number one?
10. “The Dead One”
Ringmaster (1994)
The second Joker's Card, Ringmaster suffers from the same low production value of all ICP's early efforts. Never-the-less, its raw sound appeals to some listeners and may contribute to the horror. “The Dead One” is the tale of a confused man who has died of a gunshot wound but is in denial. He stumbles through the neighborhood asking people if he is dead, and they reply mockingly in the affirmative. Lyrical gem: “My soul is so heavy that it draws me to the floor; I can hear these demons knocking at my door; They're laughing at the dead…”
9. “Hell's Forecast”
The Wraith: Shangri-La (2002)
The Wraith: Shangri-La was one of ICP's most controversial albums, because they finally revealed that the “Dark Carnival” was a metaphor for God and his divine retribution against sinners. “Hell's Forecast” is the story of a man who wakes up and finds that all of his friends are dead. The world around him is drenched in blood and horrors abound. In the end, however, it is revealed that he is in fact the one who died, and he is experiencing eternal punishment in Hell. Lyrical gem: “I lay sleepless for days as the raining continued, the heat of the sun baking corpses like food; Then it finally stopped I walk knee deep in blood, over piles of bodies threw what was my hood; It was right at that moment the Wraith had appeared, and the message it left me might sound kind of weird; But take all that I'm seeing and opposite that, truth is I'm the one dead and this is my Hell's Pit.”
8. “Dead Body Man”
The Terror Wheel (1994) and Riddle Box (1995)
Unusual for appearing on two albums, “Dead Body Man” was something of an early ICP anthem. In this song, an anonymous individual, simply known as the “Dead Body Man,” steals corpses from the local morgue and rides around his neighborhood with the bodies hanging out all over his car. He becomes a minor local celebrity in the process. While not necessarily paranormal, it is creepy enough to land on this list. Lyrical gem: “I drive through my neighborhood ringing my bell; Some people run cuz they don't like the smell; Others line up just as quick as they can; To try and catch a glimpse of the dead body man.”
7. “Fonz Pond”
Bang! Pow! Boom! (2009)
Bang! Pow! Boom! was ICP's eleventh studio album and was praised by some critics as their best to date. “Fonz Pond” is one of two songs on the album that tell a supernatural tale, and concerns a group of children who venture off to find a pond that is rumored to claim the life of anyone who visits. Although other ICP songs have featured ghosts, the theme of legend tripping is somewhat unique and the element of storytelling is enjoyable. Lyrical gem: “The fog that rides along the top; Has been said to carry voices; Those of the dead who took the dare; And jumped in, they made bad choices.”
6. “Play with Me”
The Amazing Jeckel Brothers (1999)
The Amazing Jeckel Brothers, released by Island Records, was one of ICP's most commercially successful albums and achieved platinum status, selling over 1 million copies. In the eerily catchy song “Play with Me,” a child's favorite toy is abandoned and forgotten in a toy box. Over the years, it fantasizes about exacting its revenge. Lyrical gem: “I can see you near the bed when I look through this tiny crack; You become much older now and I don't see you turning back; Seven years in darkness I can only hope my wish comes true; That one day I'll get you in my hands…AND I'LL PLAY WITH YOU!!”
5. “Southwest Voodoo”
The Great Milenko (1997)
The Great Milenko is the fourth Joker's Card in ICP's Dark Carnival mythology. The Great Milenko is an illusionist who tries to trick people into committing evil acts. This album is famously responsible for getting ICP dropped from Hollywood Records. In keeping with the theme of illusion and magic, “Southwest Voodoo” celebrates the exploits of a young, urban voodoo practitioner on Detroit's southwest side. The song pokes fun at itself, lampooning the boy's failures at creating his voodoo magic. Lyrical gem: “From Mookan House to Shangra La; Egyptian Pharaoh, coompata; Follow me, and join us as we pray; To the seventeen moons of Coonga Del Ray.”
4. “Vera Lee”
Bang! Pow! Boom! (2009)
Bang! Pow! Boom! was ICP's eleventh studio album and was praised by some critics as their best to date. “Vera Lee” is one of two songs on the album that tell a supernatural tale, and concerns a young man who realizes that a girl he went to school with had a crush on him because they were both outcasts. Unfortunately, the girl was terminally ill but never told anyone. After she died, she returned as a ghost to haunt the song's protagonist. Lyrical gem: “Now it's too late, and every night I hear her in my head; Begging me to join her with the dead, meh; To think about it's so strange, I hear her singing my name; Vera Lee is haunting my brain! I hear her in the rain!”
3. “12”
Riddle Box (1995)
“12” is a revenge fantasy involving the reanimated corpse of an executed criminal who returns from the grave to punish the 12 jurors who sentenced him to death. The criminal has the ability to take on different forms and appear from the shadows undetected. He does not harm the “innocent,” however, seeking only to kill those who were directly responsible for his death. His powers have a time limit—he must kill all 12 jurors by dawn. At dawn, as his kills his last, his body crumbles to pieces. Lyrical gem: “Watch me juggle, watch me dance; In 3-D watch me enhance; Watch me crawl out from the screen; And squeeze your neck until you're green.”
2. “In My Room”
Hell's Pit (2004)
Following on the back of The Wraith: Shangri-La [Heaven], Hell's Pit was meant to provide a glimpse into the torment that awaits sinners in the afterlife. Its content is necessarily some of the most grotesque and violent of all ICP's albums. “In My Room” is not only one of their better supernaturally-themed songs, it may be one of the best songs on the album. It concerns a young man who shuns the daylight, because in the darkness of his room he is visited by a succubus who climbs in through the window. The succubus persuades him to murder his neighbors because they spotted her one night. After he eagerly complies, the female demon/ghost disappears, leaving him alone to deal with his crime. Lyrical gem: “But she comes to my room and we talk at night, she's demonic and bloody, but she holds me tight; In my bedroom, with her I'm never alone, and I kiss her cold lips until morning comes; Then she has gone, I can still hear her voice loom. But she only exists in the dark of my room.”
1. “Amy's in the Attic”
The Terror Wheel (1994)
The Terror Wheel was an early LP featuring six tracks. With its raw, unprofessional feel, this album harkened back to the days of basement recordings and mixtapes. Despite releasing multiple albums of much better quality since the early ‘90s, the song “Amy's in the Attic” is still one of ICP's most haunting, lesser-known gems. It is the tale of a man who, as a young boy, accidentally killed his childhood friend and hid her body in the attic. Years later, he tries to convince himself that the incident was imaginary, but the constant torment inflicted by the girl's ghost says otherwise. This song is genuinely scary. Lyrical gem: “Sitting in my living room, another strange feeling; I think I'm hearing tiny footsteps on the ceiling; Looking in my mirror, the image isn't clear; I feel as if a little girl is standing at my rear; then I awake with the blink of an eye; voices from the attic yelling, ‘Why!?'”

The letter "Z" is seen painted on a hill next to the toll booth at the freeway between Monterrey and Torreon, in the Mexican state of Coahuila March 13, 2010. The "Z" refers to the Zetas drug cartel. Reuters/Tomas Bravo Daniela remembers being driven blindfolded through the desert in northern Mexico, thinking she was going to her death. She recalls being told to get out of the van, uncover her eyes, and follow her armed captors into a large house and down into the cellar. She was obliged to watch what was going on, and tried to blank out her mind.
It didn't work. She still remembers the scene — about five young women bound to pillars, surrounded by men who had paid a lot of money not just to rape them, but to torture and perhaps kill them as well.
Daniela is not her real name. She insists on a pseudonym, because she may have escaped, but the reach of her former captors is long. What she saw that day was just one of many horrific experiences she went through in seven years as a sex slave, first under the control of the Zetas cartel and then the Gulf cartel. It ended with her escape last year and her return to her family in Nicaragua, where the nightmare had begun.
"I saw lots of people die, and die in horrible ways," she says, drinking hot chocolate and eating pizza in a Mexico City cafe. "I want to talk because people have to know what is happening on the border to the girls who are disappeared, and with lots of the girls who are working in the sex trade in narco areas."

Daniela's case is now being investigated by the Mexican attorney general's office, but if she had waited for the government to come save her, she would almost certainly not be free today.
According to Mexican government figures, 20,203 men and 7,435 women were classified as "missing or disappeared" in the country at the end of last year. That's pretty much the same number as it was when President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012, promising to do more to end the horror of those disappearances at the hands of the drug cartels. The pledges intensified after the mass disappearance of 43 student teachers in September 2014 in the southern city of Iguala triggered national, and international, outrage.
Human rights groups in Mexico and outside have repeatedly lambasted authorities for not doing more to find the missing. This week, 68 US members of Congress signed a letter addressed to Secretary of State John Kerry on the "ongoing human rights crisis in Mexico." It began with a reference to the disappeared.
Those who go missing rarely come back to tell their stories. The reasons for their abduction vary, but many are kidnapped into sexual slavery. Daniela's story of survival is as extraordinary as it is harrowing.
Daniela says that she herself was shocked when she discovered the length of her ordeal. She'd estimated it had lasted four or five years, but her kidnappers had always kept her deliberately confused about the passage of time.
"Sometimes when I was with a client I would find out what month or year it was because it came up in the conversation, but if they heard me ask a question they would beat me really badly," she recalls. "There was no radio, no TV, no newspapers, nothing. I slept in one of their houses, they took me to the clients to do ugly things, they took the money, and then they took me back to sleep."
It all began when she was a 22-year-old, struggling to feed her children and her mother by working as a seamstress in an assembly-for-export factory near her hometown in Nicaragua.
It was April 2008 and Nicaragua was relatively free of the horrific violence that already rampaged in parts of Mexico, and in neighboring countries in Central America. Daniela had no obvious reason to be wary about accepting an invitation to attend a meeting in which she was told she would be evaluated for a loan.
All 15 young women who went to that meeting near the Honduras border were kidnapped.
Women take part in the search of missing persons in an area near the village of La Union, on the outskirts of Torreon, in the Mexican state of Coahuila February 21, 2015. For the past two months, relatives of missing people in the Mexican city of Torreon have met every Saturday to personally look for missing relatives after the city was severely hit by an increase in murders, due to an intense struggle between rival drug gangs.

Gunmen took their identification papers, and dressed them in clean jeans, t-shirts, and white baseball caps. They threatened to kill their families if they didn't follow detailed instructions while being driven through border posts into Honduras, and then Guatemala, Belize, and finally Mexico.
Two days into the trip they stopped in the city of Comitán in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas and were put to work in a dark and dirty brothel. Daniela says they were beaten when their inexperience showed. Two weeks later the group headed north again. Daniela says she was the last to be delivered to her new masters, in Nuevo Laredo, in the state of Tamaulipas, a stone's throw from Texas. It was only then that she found out she was in the power of the Zetas.
The Zetas were formed in the 1990s from a kernel of deserters from the special forces, recruited into the Gulf cartel to protect its then-leader, Osiel Cárdenas. By the time they kidnapped Daniela, they were a criminal organization famed for the ruthless way they disposed of their enemies and exercised power over people who lived in their strongholds, the most important of which was in Tamaulipas.

Nothing during the interview affects Daniela as deeply as when she talks about the boy she thought of as a little brother while they both worked at the Danash table dance club in the center of Nuevo Laredo. She met him when he was just 12 years old, and the memory makes her sob.
Daniela was supposed to dance, drink and get high with clients, and fulfill a quota of six sexual services a night in the cubicles of the club. He was a busboy, a messenger, a lookout, and a DJ, who was also rented out to clients, many of them US tourists, who wanted sex with children.
Daniela and her putative little brother snatched furtive chats when their captors weren't looking. They fantasized about freedom. They helped each other survive.
When the boy got digestive problems that stopped him from working, cartel gunmen took him and Daniela to the mountains outside the city.
There they gave Daniela a gun and ordered her to kill him. When she wouldn't, they gave the gun to the teenager and told him to kill her. When he also refused to shoot, they hung him from a tree and began to cut him. Eventually they killed him.
"I never heard anything more about him," she says.
Daniela later learned that the order to kill was a test to see if she could be transformed from a sex slave into a sicario— a hitman. When it was clear she didn't have what it takes, the cartel gave her drug smuggling duties instead. That is a recognized pattern, in which sex trafficking victims are pushed into new criminal jobs once they get older and make less money for their captors.
Daniela says that her new job brought her into contact with cartel leaders with names well known to law enforcement, like Z-40, Metro 3, and Catracho.
She also met a Zeta known as La Ardilla, and says she was with him when he ordered the massacre of 72 Central American migrants in August 2010. She later told the authorities that he killed them because he thought they were reinforcements for his enemies.
That massacre came as the Zetas and the Gulf were fighting an all-out war following their split at the start of that year. It included major battles involving very heavily armed gunmen carried in convoys of dozens of vehicles at a time.
Daniela started the war as the slave/lover of a Zeta commander nicknamed El Viejón who had chosen her. When he decided to change his loyalties to the Gulf, she inevitably went with him.
Being identified as the personal property of a cartel boss meant Daniela had a localizing chip inserted into her foot. It did not, however, free her from the obligation to have sex with clients as well. In fact conditions at the brothel where she worked got even worse once the Gulf cartel took over, despite the Zetas' more bloodthirsty reputation.
Daniela says the new bosses videotaped clients from the moment they entered the bar. The rooms had hidden microphones and cameras.
She says the women were shown videos of the torture and murder of those caught trying to escape. Becoming an addict could also lead to being disappeared for good. Then there were the victims of the clients who paid to torture and even kill them, like the women she had seen in a basement around the middle of her ordeal. Daniela claims her captors once showed her a video of henchmen feeding body parts to a lion kept in a safe house in the city of Reynosa.
Though Daniela says she did her best to stay out of trouble, once she courted death when she was told to watch over a couple who had been kidnapped.
"It was the first time I'd ever been told to watch anyone, and they looked so sad," she remembers. "I thought, well I'm dead anyway, so I let them go. I let them run and hide."
She says that act of rebellion brought her a horrific beating and then a trip to the countryside where El Viejón got into a tractor and threatened to run over her. Then he changed his mind and instead ordered her to spend hours on her knees in front of cartel members, after which she was shut in a van with nothing to eat or drink until near death.
Then, Daniela says, it was back to work at the brothel.
According to the latest government report on sex trafficking in Mexico, dated 2014, there are 47 identified criminal groups involved in the business, with leaders in Central America, Mexico, and the United States, and bars and discos around the northern frontier.
Daniela is not sure if any of the clients knew she was a slave, but she believes some had their suspicions. She says sometimes it was clear they noticed her bruises — even though she was not beaten in the face, and the cubicles were dark — but they turned away. And appealing for help was out of the question, she says, though sometimes she tried to communicate her desperation with her eyes.
Daniela won't give the details of how she eventually escaped, got the chip out of her foot, and fled to safety. She will only say that somebody risked their lives to help her. "They got me out of the place, they paid my transport to Mexico City," is all she will say. "If I say more they will kill that person, and I would never forgive myself."
She has good reason to fear for her savior's life. Violence continues unabated in Tamaulipas even after the end of the war between the Gulf and the Zetas, which has now been replaced by a multiplicity of battles between many different factions of both cartels.

Daniela also won't talk about the details of how she ended up telling her story to federal investigators in Mexico City. Initially, she says, they sent her back to Nicaragua, but her case was revived after the Mexican NGO Unidos contra la Trata, which works on sex trafficking came knocking on her door.
The activists persuaded her to get in contact with a special prosecutor for sex crimes. Her hope, she says, is that the investigation will lead to raids freeing women she thinks are still captive and helpless.
Daniela says that her family filed a missing person's report in Nicaragua when she disappeared. They also went to the local television station, and put up posters. Then they gave her up for dead. She, like most Central Americans who go missing in Mexico, wouldn't even have appeared on the Mexican register of 28,000 disappeared.
Daniela recalls her mother's incredulity when she called from a police station in the Mexican capital. She began to believe her only when the conversation turned to old memories, like the dress she'd made her daughter for her 15th birthday that was too long.
"Daughter, you are alive," Daniela remembers her mother cried when the penny finally dropped. "Yes, I'm here, Mom, I'm here."

Welcome to the new WIRED. This site is the culmination of more than two years of work by dozens of super-talented people, people I'm proud to have as colleagues. From the responsive layouts to the improved APIs that make the whole thing work behind the scenes to the journalism itself, we've reimagined every aspect of the WIRED experience. And we have improved it.
WIRED readers are the kind of people who want to know more than what. You want to know how and why. To that end, I want to walk you through our thinking on the new site—to tell you about the technology and design innovations that make this iteration of WIRED possible.
Scott Dadich About Scott Dadich is the editor-in-chief of WIRED.
Back in 1994 we launched Hotwired, the first site with original editorial content created for the web. It was a digital home for reporting on the future of science, business, design, and technology. You've come to trust us over the past two decades, but our growth online has sometimes come too quickly and with some pain. When I took over as editor-in-chief in 2012, WIRED had an archive of more than 100,000 stories. That's good! But they were spread out over more than a dozen different databases, sections, and homepages tenuously connected by virtual duct tape and chewing gum. The cleanup process—onerous and without a shred of glamour—took almost 15 months. But finally, last year, our engineers rolled out a newly unified site architecture built atop a single streamlined WordPress installation. And you didn't notice a hiccup. Maybe you saw that pages loaded a touch faster. Stories looked more WIRED.
That's when the real rock-breaking started. With the site's foundation now solid, our editorial, design, engineering, and product teams began to redesign for the most important screen in your life—your smartphone. As you can imagine, this was a bit more work than picking a fresh skin for your Winamp (Big Bento, anyone?). We settled on a card-based motif for both its flexibility and configurability.
12
Once we had that design locked, we found ways to expand it to other screens—desktop, laptop, tablet, and anywhere else you access WIRED. Our award-winning photographs are Retina-ready. Graphics are SVG sprites. I like the cards because no matter what the device, our homepage and section fronts are now immediately scannable, giving you a more accurate preview of the stories that define our world. Crucially, the new structure allows us to deploy WIRED's signature bespoke fonts and improve the overall typographic fidelity of our layouts. This new WIRED is a more comfortable browsing and reading experience, its stories primed for sharing with friends and colleagues.
But none of that razzle-dazzle matters if you can't get our pages to load. So we made a significant investment in decluttering and streamlining our code. WIRED's director of engineering, Kathleen Vignos, has shared a bit more detail in this fascinating post, but I'll summarize with this bit of good news: In most cases, the new site loads twice as fast. Our tech team stripped out over half of the browser calls, drastically reducing the need for the browser to repaint our web pages; as a result articles like the one you're reading now load perceptibly faster. Image galleries and videos appear on demand. We're even hosted on new state-of-the-art servers.
Even if you don't notice any of that turboboosting, you'll see an updated, simpler information architecture and site taxonomy. The original Hotwired was organized under the banner of six bright icons. We've picked up on that legacy with our six new section fronts: Business, Design, Entertainment, Gear, Science, and Security. A world-class team of editors and reporters, experts in their fields, runs each desk. Starting today, we're going to update the site more frequently; the new section fronts should become your dashboards for the day's news and feature stories. Even our physical newsroom reflects these changes; our offices are set up to facilitate communication and collaboration among our editors, designers, and developers. The team has a new metabolism to power the new site.
But we didn't design the new WIRED to be perfect. We designed it to be perfected. We'll continue to make the technology faster and more powerful, the stories more informative and more fun. In the process, I'm sure you'll find areas we can improve. I hope you'll let us know about them. We're trying to make better stuff in cooler ways more often. We believe we've created both the tools and the platform for WIRED to grow and evolve as fast as the technologies we cover.

On the pitch, Cardiff City are having a season that has been about successful as any of their supporters could hope for. The club is eight points clear at the top of the Football League Championship with only a third of the season left to play, and barring a spectacular collapse a place in the top division of the English football system for the first time in a little over fifty years is now a near certainty. Off the pitch, however, the rebranding of the club continues a face, and the schism between those supporters who don't care that much about it and those that are opposed to the culture of their club being sacrificed at the altar of the promise of a place in the Premier League remains as great as ever.
Next Tuesday, Cardiff City play Brighton & Hove Albion at The Cardiff City Stadium in match which may well prove to be another opportunity for those divisions to show themselves. The club has announced that it will be giving away twenty thousand scarves prior to this match, but it doesn't require a great deal of cynicism to consider that this giveaway might not necessarily be motivated by generosity alone. A considerable proportion of the club's support has stuck with its previous blue and white livery, and giving away a whole load of red and white scarves next week might well counter that degree of apathy towards the changing of the club's colours.
“Each scarf will be handed out on arrival at the stadium – for this game only – and will become your special entry pass into our 2013/14 season ticket competition for the rest of the campaign,” said a predictably breathless email sent to supporters earlier this week. One lucky winner, who, presumably, will be photographed wearing their scarf with a gleeful look on their face as part of the PR campaign, will win a season ticket for next season as a result of their complicity in this scheme, whilst it doesn't seem unreasonable to suggest that the club might well also benefit from having a photographer on hand to take pictures of twenty thousand-odd people, all wearing the club's new colours, for future use. There is, however, a possibility that such a ploy could backfire. As things stand, organised protests against the change in colours have been neutered by the team's success on the pitch. Such a stunt, however, may give those that might have fallen silent over the last few weeks or months to make a very public statement regarding what they feel owner Vincent Tan is doing to their club, pause for thought again.
Tan, meanwhile, has allowed his actions to speak for him over the last few months. Last weekend, however, he finally broke his self-imposed silence with an interview, and what he said will not necessarily have ameliorated those of the opinion that his plans for the club have more to do with his ambitions at home in Malaysia than specifically for the people or the city of Cardiff. ‘The ball is round,' he said, indicating that he has either just completed the first class in a series called Association Football For Dummies 101 or that he has become a disciple of the great German coach Sepp Herrberger, who came up with enigmatic quotation, ‘The ball is round so that the game can change direction', before perhaps giving away the fact that he hasn't been sitting at home watching the 1954 World Cup final on a loop by adding that, ‘but you never know. Every game is hard fought and unpredictable. We cannot be too confident but the players try their best.' There have, of course, been plenty of football club owners in in the past that have had a shaky relationship with the footballing aspect of the business that they own, but what was perhaps more interesting than this was what Tan had to say about the future direction of the club that he now runs with an iron fist.
Although Tan doesn't go into any detail about the thinking behind his rebranding of Cardiff City, he does offer some insight into the thinking behind how he regards the club and its foreseeable future. Malaysia, unsurprisingly, features heavily. He clearly feels some kinship with his fellow Malaysian club owner, Tony Fernandes of Queens Park Rangers, saying that, ‘Both of us would like to contribute to Malaysian football and we are thinking of a way to do so.' Of course, the obvious answer to such a statement would be to say that a similar amount of money to that which he has put into Cardiff City over the last few months or so might have radically changed the face of domestic and international football in that country, but this might not be a concern to the supporters of the club that he does now own. Their club now has the word ‘Malaysia' splayed across the front of the team's shirts – although it should be pointed out that this is not some sort of state sponsorship but one of Tan's companies that is paying for it – whilst the club's colours and badge have already been changed and the recent free scarf announcement seems to indicate that supporters can expect further changes in the future.
Tan also left himself – and, by proxy, his club – open to question by saying, ‘If we are promoted it will be good for Malaysia as we will have two Malaysian-owned teams up there – Queens Park Rangers and us. After this fans may get to see a Malaysian derby in the Premier League!' Now, this may have been no more than a weak joke. If it was, then it can only really be interpreted as a firm two fingers being thrusted in an upwardly direction towards those with misgivings regarding the direction in which their club appears to be headed at present. Joking about such a matter when he must surely know fully well about the effect that his ownership of the club doesn't portray a very positive image of the man. On the other hand, however, Tan may even genuinely believe that this is how people define a ‘derby' match, in which case he may be in for a surprise if any match against QPR – presuming they stay up this season – passes by with scarcely any comment whilst the matches against Swansea City, which is surely the measure of any rivalry that Cardiff have, would resume after their brief hiatus with their traditional ferocity.
We do not know where the rebranding of Cardiff City will end up. Ninian Park – completed before Tan's arrival but likely a major factor in his decision to get involved at this club at this time – has gone. The blue shirts have gone. The traditional bluebird has been relegated to an afterthought on the club badge, and the club clearly wishes its supporters to jettison their blue and white scarves for red ones. It would be unsurprising to see the blue seats at The Cardiff City Stadium ripped out and replaced by red ones in the summer. How long might it be before Vincent Tan decides that ‘Cardiff City' is an outdated name and that the club could be dragged into the twenty-first century by changing it to something that better reflects the club's relationship with Malaysia? And how long could it conceivably be before he sought to cement this relationship by seeking to play competitive matches in Kuala Lumpur? It's impossible to say how far down this apocalyptic road he might go, but should he have any thoughts in this direction he has encountered little resistance from the club's support. We're not suggesting that these possible outcomes are going to come to pass, merely that the lack of opposition to them can only make them more, and not less, likely. And if it ever does come to the point at which Cardiff supporters want to protest over a step too far only to find that it's too late by that time, they'll only have one place to look in any subsequent quest for recriminations.

British graffiti artist Banksy popped up again on Monday, tagging a wall in Red Hook with a 3-dimensional red heart-shaped balloon covered in bandages — which was quickly defaced by a rival artist, according to reports.
Graffiti artist “Omar NYC,” also known as “SWATCH,” spray-painted over the heart and scrawled his own name next to the artwork in front of shocked fans who'd gathered to gawk at the piece, reports the blog AnimalNY.
“Peopled booed him,” Alma Aguilera, who photographed the jealous wannabe in the act, told the blog. Aguilera also said the vandal was with a group posing as a news crew before he whipped out the spray paint.
AnimalNY reports that “Omar” has a long history of defacing projects by the much more famous Banksy.
The floating Mylar balloon mural was painted on a wall of a building at the corner of King and Van Brunt streets.
“This piece is obviously an iconic representation of the battle to survive a broken heart. It's an uplifting visual poem to that most fragile of human emotions that seem to move within us as if on a soft breeze,” an audio guide at banksy.co.uk explains.
The narrator then appears to take a hit of helium and, with gas-altered high pitched voice, goes into a raunchy impersonation of Mickey Mouse.
Banksy started his project on Oct. 1 and has created five works so far, taking Sunday off.
The street art has been lauded, lampooned, altered, erased and defaced by people and pets alike.
He has just over three weeks to go in his project, entitled “Better Out Than In.”

Starting on April 21, undergraduates will be able to vote on the only question on the Undergraduate Council's spring referendum generated by a student petition—whether or not to support the reintroduction of American Sign Language courses that may be taken for credit.
A petition led by Erica X Eisen '16, a Crimson Arts Chair, and Julia B. Hyman '15 garnered 704 votes, surpassing the 670 signature threshold required for a question to be placed on the ballot, according to UC Rules Committee Chair Kevin H. Xiong '17.
In their 300-word pro statement, Eisen and Hyman emphasized the importance of ASL, but noted obstacles students currently face in learning the language.
“ASL is a beautiful, unique language with a culture and literature all its own—but Harvard students currently taking ASL must pay out of pocket to take weekend classes organized by PBHA's Committee on Deaf Awareness (CODA). Students receive no academic credit for enrollment in these classes,” they wrote.

Despite high student demand, the Linguistics Department eliminated its two introductory sign language courses in 1994, citing budget constraints.
Julian Guy '16, a former University Initiatives Coordinator for the CODA said that reintroducing the course at the College would attract more students and allow them to study the language more closely.
“Having a rigorous course would be the best way to ensure that people are actually going to be able to learn the language...at a full level,” Guy said.
Hyman, who serves as director of the CODA, noted that even though many students may want to take ASL courses, it is difficult for them to do so.
“It's very hard for students to be able to get to a Sunday class and one that is for no course credit is hard for Harvard students to be able to fit in their schedule, even if it's something that is important,” Hyman said, adding that the CODA has been working for several years to reintegrate ASL classes into the course catalog.
Dhruv P. Goyal '16, UC Education Committee chair, said that although the committee has not been in contact with the petition organizers, he agrees that the effort would be an “absolutely fantastic” means of equipping students with sign language communication skills.
Because of changes made last year in the UC's referenda procedure, in order for the Council to immediately adopt the voter's response to the question as its official stance, at least half the student body must participate in the election.
Before the question goes on the ballot, the UC will solicit a 300-word con statement from students and collaborate with the Institute of Politics to edit the question and statements to ensure neutral wording.
Although the deadline for petitions has passed, individual UC representatives may submit additional referenda questions to the Council.

Still, the revenge Western debuts behind Tarantino's last two films.
Quentin Tarantino's neo-Western The Hateful 8 opened to $3.5 million (€3.25 million) from 579 screens in Germany, good enough for the top slot. Including previews, the film took in $3.9 million in its first frame.
The opening, however, was a way's off Tarantino's best for the territory. The director's last film, Django Unchained, earned around $9.8 million on its opening weekend in Germany in 2013.
Alejandro G. Inarritu's The Revenant fell to No. 2 in its fourth weekend with $2.7 million (€2.3 million) from 240,000 admissions for a total $18.8 million.
Arguably the real success story of the past weekend in Germany was local-language kids film Bibi & Tina — Girls vs. Boys, which barely slipped at all in its sophomore frame, earning $2.3 million (€2.1 million) from 330,000 tickets sold. Bibi & Tina, the third feature in a homegrown franchise, sold 370,000 tickets on its opening weekend for a $2.6 million bow.
Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens held on to the fourth spot, taking its total in Germany to $106.1 million. J.J. Abrams' Star Wars has only performed better in two international territories: the U.K. ($176.4 million) and China ($121.1 million).
American constitutional democracy is in an existential crisis right now, and it's not easy to see how this ends.
President-elect Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE has made clear he will not respect limits on presidential power. Even before taking office, he and his minions have threatened to clamp down on journalists and dissenters, demonstrating contempt for the First Amendment.
Former Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) recently suggested that Trump could "close down the elite press" by choosing which press outlets he personally decides are legitimate. Richard Painter, former ethics lawyer under George W. Bush, warns that Trump has "serious conflicts of interest" that will place him in violation of the Constitution as soon as he takes office.
Most troubling of all, the U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a cyber espionage operation aimed at helping Trump win election. There are unconfirmed reports that Russia also collected compromising information it could use to blackmail Trump. There is also reporting raising concerns that the FBI "blocked a thorough inquiry into Mr. Trump [and Russia]."
Recently, civil rights activist Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) has concluded that, because of Russian interference in the election, Trump cannot be a legitimate president.

This all adds up to an unprecedented crisis of legitimacy, and it is difficult to know where we go from here.
The first step, when it comes to Russia, is sorting out what actually happened. That requires an independent, nonpartisan investigation. The Senate intelligence committee has announced that it plans to begin investigating "counterintelligence concerns related to Russia and the 2016 election."
That's a good start (though not the kind of independent commission many have in mind), but we can't passively sit back and assume this will be sufficient. If the investigation confirms assessments and reports that Russia helped Trump win the presidency and is now in a position to blackmail him, that would require the extraordinary and unprecedented remedy of a new election. None of this can happen unless Americans of all political stripes recognize the danger we are in and support their elected representatives in doing what is necessary to set things right.
Whether we can find a path through this thicket depends on all Americans recognizing this is about the legitimacy of our constitutional democracy, not typical partisan divisions.
Some Republicans understand this. Mark Salter, former chief of staff to Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCainGOP lobbyists worry Trump lags in K Street fundraising Mark Kelly kicks off Senate bid: ‘A mission to lift up hardworking Arizonans' Gabbard hits back at Meghan McCain after fight over Assad MORE (R-Ariz.), suggests that we need "an uncommon country-before-tribe commitment from Republican and Democratic politicians" and others. He's right — and elected officials can only find the courage to act if they have the support and urging of their constituents.
That means Trump voters must acknowledge they made a mistake. This is, without a doubt, a difficult thing to do. I understand this.
I was too young to vote in 1988, but I thought that year's presidential election was a contest for the soul of America. Then-Vice President George H.W. Bush's campaign rhetoric and choice of an unqualified running mate, convinced me that he would be dangerous for the country. I worried he was in the pocket of the religious right and other extremist elements in the Republican Party.
I was wrong; Bush was no extremist. The elder Bush was a better president than Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis would have been, and likely would have been better in many if not most ways than Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonInviting Kim Jong-un to Washington Howard Schultz must run as a Democrat for chance in 2020 Trump says he never told McCabe his wife was 'a loser' MORE, the man elected to replace him in 1992.
We all make mistakes. What matters is owning up to that, taking responsibility for our actions, and trying to set things right. Those of us (which includes a number of Republicans and conservatives) who already are confronting the crisis our nation faces must reach out to Trump voters in friendship, as our fellow citizens.
This is not about bitterness, settling scores, or showing anyone up. It is about recognizing that we face the most serious constitutional crisis since Nixon's presidency. As we did more than 40 years ago, Americans must cross partisan lines to defend our constitutional democracy.
None of this will be at all easy, but it is an essential test of our patriotism, integrity and national character.

The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the views of The Hill.
Caroline Lucas is not a natural attention-seeker. And so, when she decided she could no longer serve as a patron of Stop The War, she stood down with the minimum of fuss. Several weeks after her low-key resignation, and somewhat to her alarm, she has become a central character in the drama engulfing the campaign group.
A few days have passed since Britain's only Green MP felt compelled to release a statement saying she had left because of shortage of time and “in light of some of the group's recent positions.” Specifically, she was “troubled by some statements after the Paris atrocities.”
Lucas was not the only one to baulk at a blog, later removed, blaming the Paris atrocities on “western support for extremist violence in the Middle East.” Does she agree with Peter Tatchell, a fellow crusader, that the group she supported wholeheartedly for so long has “lost its moral compass?”
“I wouldn't have the arrogance to presume to advise Jeremy [Corbyn]. I'm sure he will do what he thinks is best”.
While she does not go so far, she was shocked to have witnessed a meeting chaired by Jeremy Corbyn's ally, Diane Abbott at which Syrians opposed to Stop the War's position were apparently denied the microphone. “Given that there were Syrians in the room, they should have been given airtime to expess their views,” she says.
We speak as Lucas is about to board the Eurostar to Paris, and it is clear that the furore has dismayed her. As Britain's Queen of Green, she had hoped to be in the headlines for her views on the deal thrashed out at the climate change summit hosted by France. Instead she worries that her protest against Stop the War has become “a stick to beat Jeremy Corbyn.”
Would she, like many of Corbyn's horrified MPs, have counselled him to stay away from Stop The War's fundraising dinner? “I wouldn't have the arrogance to presume to advise Jeremy. I'm sure he will do what he thinks is best,” she replies.
(In the event, Corbyn attended the dinner but slipped in through a back door in a failed attempt to avoid publicity.)
Tact is one of Lucas's hallmarks. She is polite, good-humoured, impeccably-dressed and would not look out of place in the staffroom of the private Malvern Girls' College, which her parents, staunch Conservatives, chose for her education. In an age of in-fighting, she is popular among politicians of all parties. Her 55th birthday, the day before our interview, had been recognised by a rival parliamentarian, who interrupted Prime Minister's Questions to salute her. “Stephen Pound [a Labour MP] hollered out ‘happy birthday' across PMQs, bless him,” she says.
“I'd like to put some clear green water between us and the Labour Party". Caroline Lucas
Lucas's appeal stems, in part, from her reluctance to comply with any stern green stereotype. Far from insisting on ethically-sourced lentils, she buys some groceries at Waitrose, her tights at M&S and wishes it was cheaper for people to have greener lifestyles. Her own favourite shop is a green store called HISBE (How It Should Be), which runs on a low profit margin, undercuts the prices of mainstream retailers and operates in an unfashionable part of Brighton far away from the expensive haunts of the well-heeled middle classes. She also deplores the fact that green options are often hard to find. “I'm a vegetarian, and I think it would be good if we ate less meat. So why aren't there vegetarian food stands at stations?”
For all her reasonable manner and modest wishlist, Lucas is ready to go to the barricades for her beliefs. In 2001, she was convicted of breaching the peace during a CND sit-in outside the Faslane Trident nuclear submarine base in Scotland. More recently, she was charged (though subsequently cleared of) obstructing the highway during an anti-fracking protest in Balcombe, West Sussex.
Both episodes point to a fervour that allows Lucas to survive frustration. At the 2015 general election, the Greens seemed on the cusp of glory, with three seats in their grasp. Though the party took a record 1.2 million votes, and Lucas increased her majority in Brighton Pavilion from 1,252 to almost 8,000, the breakthrough never happened.
Critics laid some blame on Natalie Bennett, who replaced Lucas as leader. While Bennett was “magnificent,” in her predecessor's view, at motivating grassroots support, her election campaign was remembered chiefly for two car-crash interviews. Even the loyal Lucas concedes that those performances were “not so good. What effect that had on the final result is hard to say.”
Bennett's leadership term ends next year, and some people speculate, in hope, that Lucas will run again. “It's not in my plans,” she says, while refusing categorically to deny the possibility. “I never rule anything in or out because if you do, then something happens.”
Chance has played a large part in Lucas's life. Her father, who ran a small heating company in Worcestershire, unwittingly contrived to put his daughter off renewable energy by installing solar heating panels that woke her up at 5am when the motors cranked into action. Many years later, after studying English Literature at Exeter University, she was inspired by the environmental campaigner Jonathan Porritt to get involved in politics.
"It's quite extraordinary that he [the Prime Minister] can say something that sounds so right and then do exactly the opposite". Caroline Lucas
Before she was elected, first to the European Parliament and then as an MP in 2010, she moved to Oxford to work for Oxfam. Almost the first person she encountered there was her future husband, Richard le Quesne Savage, an English teacher and a former Warwickshire cricketer who once bowled out the legendary batsman Sir Viv Richards.
“I met him because he was my landlord. He had a room to rent, and I moved in,” she says. That arrangement developed into a love affair, or as Lucas puts it: “I thought, ‘Never mind this paying the rent lark.'” The couple married two years later and had two sons, now aged 22 and 19. The older one is studying for a Masters degree in the US, the younger has just started university in Norwich. Lucas misses both badly.
“It was very hard getting used to an empty house,” she says. “When the first one went, it was sad, and when the second one left, the house felt hauntingly empty. So we filled it with a very large rescue dog called Harry, which has taken my mind off it.”

When she has time away from politics, Lucas is the happiest walking on the South Downs not far from her Brighton home. “I love taking the dog there and watching him run. I love the sense of freedom that he feels. It makes me feel free as well.”
Though she was hopeful a better deal than expected might be done at Paris, Lucas is furious that the rhetoric of David Cameron, who called for “action now, not excuses tomorrow” bears so little relation to Britain's slashing of green energy subsidies. Her allies include major companies like Ikea and Tesco, who are urging Mr Cameron to rethink.
“It's quite extraordinary that he [the Prime Minister] can say something that sounds so right and then do exactly the opposite,” she says. “I struggle to make sense of it. Businesses need certainty, and it's unbelievable that so many of our good green policies are being slashed.”
While she shares some of Jeremy Corbyn's aims and counts him as “a friend”, she is also frustrated by Labour's lack of attention to climate change. “I'd like to put some clear green water between us and the Labour Party,” she says. “They still don't get it.”

Despite standing shoulder to shoulder with Corbyn on issues such as taking the railways back into public ownership, Lucas sees one key difference: “The Greens are united, whereas he is in pitched battle with his supporters.” Not to mention some of his shadow cabinet and most of his MPs?
“Yes. And at the very moment when we need to have a strong Opposition against a Tory party that will destroy local government as we know it. That ought to be the story – not John McDonnell and his Little Red Book.”
Some weeks after the shadow chancellor flourished the thoughts of Mao Zedong in his response to the Chancellor's autumn statement, Lucas is unforgiving. “That backfired horribly. It was a tragedy that it became the story, rather than local councils having to make decisions between educational need and adult social care.”
Deeply as she cares about such issues, Lucas also has the capacity to switch off from politics. Her home life sounds both comfortable and chaotic (“The dog has just eaten all my birthday cards,” she complains), and she is already thinking ahead to Christmas. “The best thing is that the kids are coming home. Richard is the cook, so he will be doing Christmas dinner. I'll be relegated to peeling the sprouts or something.”
That task will be a rare supporting role for Lucas. Her rebukes, be they aimed at Stop the War or party leaders, have made her the conscience of the Commons. The question, with the world's eye on green issues, is whether she can build a power base on that foundation.
Mexico City closed museums and other cultural venues, and advised people not to attend movies or public events. Seven million students, from kindergartners to college students, were kept from classes in Mexico City and the neighboring State of Mexico on Friday, in what news organizations called the first citywide closing of schools since a powerful earthquake in 1985.

Because of the situation, the World Health Organization planned to consider raising the world pandemic flu alert to 4 from 3. Such a high level of alert — meaning that sustained human-to-human transmission of a new virus has been detected — has not been reached in recent years, even with the H5N1 avian flu circulating in Asia and Egypt, and would “really raise the hackles of everyone around the world,” said Dr. Robert G. Webster, a flu virus expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis.
Mexico's flu season is usually over by now, but health officials have noticed a significant spike in flu cases since mid-March. The W.H.O. said there had been 800 cases in Mexico in recent weeks, 60 of them fatal, of a flulike illness that appeared to be more serious than the regular seasonal flu. Mr. Córdova said Friday that there were 1,004 possible cases.
Still, only a small number have been confirmed as cases of the new H1N1 swine flu, according to Gregory Hartl, a W.H.O. spokesman. Mexican authorities confirmed 16 deaths from swine flu and said 45 others were under investigation, most of them in the Mexico City area. The C.D.C. said that eight nonfatal cases had been confirmed in the United States, and that it had sent teams to California and Texas to investigate.

“We are worried,” said Dr. Richard Besser, the acting head of the C.D.C. “We don't know if this will lead to the next pandemic, but we will be monitoring it and taking it seriously.”
There is no point in trying to use containment measures in the United States, he said, because the swine flu virus has already appeared from San Antonio to San Diego, without any obvious connections among cases. Containment measures usually work only when a disease is confined to a small area, he said.
The C.D.C. refrained from warning people not to visit Mexico. Even so, the outbreak comes at an awful time for tourism officials, who have been struggling to counter the perception that violence has made Mexico unsafe for travelers. The outbreak was also causing alarm among Mexicans, many of whom rushed to buy masks or get checkups.

“I hope it's not something grave,” said Claudia Cruz, who took her 11-year-old son, Efrain, to a clinic on Friday after hearing the government warnings.

Health officials urged anyone with a fever, a cough, a sore throat, shortness of breath or muscle and joint pain to seek medical attention.
When a new virus emerges, it can sweep through the population, said Dr. Anne Moscona, a flu specialist at Cornell University's medical school. The Spanish flu is believed to have infected at least 25 percent of the United States population, but killed less than 3 percent of those infected.

The leading theory on why so many young, healthy people die in pandemics is the “cytokine storm,” in which vigorous immune systems pour out antibodies to attack the new virus. That can inflame lung cells until they leak fluid, which can overwhelm the lungs, Dr. Moscona said.
But older people who have had the flu repeatedly in their lives may have some antibodies that provide cross-protection to the new strain, she said. And immune responses among the aged are not as vigorous.
Despite the alarm in recent years over the H5N1 avian flu, which is still circulating in China, Indonesia, Egypt and elsewhere, some flu experts argued that it would never cause a pandemic, because no H5 strain ever had. All previous pandemics have been caused by H1s, H2s or H3s.
Among the swine flu cases in the United States, none had had any contact with pigs; cases involving a father and daughter and two 16-year-old schoolmates convinced the authorities that the virus was being transmitted from person to person.
In Canada, hit by the SARS epidemic in 2003, health officials urged those who had recently traveled to Mexico and become ill to seek treatment immediately.

The good: Other One > New Potato - woah, nellie - the latter in particular is drawn wayyyyy out before the conclusion. Insanely beautiful.
The lone performance of Rosemary is difficult with all the hiss and such, but this is such an important song in the Dead canon, it is worth hearing. I myself find no other Hunter/Garcia work so evocative of the psychedelic world - lyrically it is so sad, so Tolkien-esque and mysterious - the images clear, uncluttered, an all-too-brief but devastating glimpse into that psychic universe that really does seem tangible. "Rosemary" is economical and self-contained along the same lines as that Hemingway story that's six words long: "For sale: baby shoes. Never worn".
The ugly: the cuts in Cryptical, and at the end of that lovely Friend of Mine. The Eleven fading out after technical problems. Death Don't is sliced in half. There are just too many problems here to warrant a full rating, although I believe the band is as good as they ever were in '68 this night in Louisville. - December 7, 2013--

Subject: Rosemary! A rare live performance of Rosemary is the highlight (for me) of this show. It is fairly quiet, but I have never heard another live version of it. The rest of the show is great, probably just to freak out the mid-westerners who were probably quite taken aback by the crew from San Fran! Bellarmine isn't a very large school to begin with, so I wouldn't doubt that there were fewer than 500 people attending, I may be wrong. The recording itself is pretty good for '68, but the unique playing of Rosemary makes it worth having! - June 25, 2011Rosemary!

U.S. President Donald Trump's failure to fill dozens of senior-level positions at the Pentagon is making it difficult for defense contractors to forecast business.
Defense company officials, speaking on conference calls after their just-reported quarterly earnings, did not blame Trump directly, but said the lack of appointments to key positions at the Pentagon had slowed contract awards and created uncertainty.
“The still-high number of unfilled leadership appointments and the approaching government physical year-end continue to serve as headwinds,” said Roger Krone, chief executive of Leidos Holdings (ldos), on an Aug. 3 call with analysts.
Krone, whose company is one of the largest providers of services to U.S. armed forces, said those open posts have slowed the awarding of government contracts.
The Department of Defense said it has 42 unfilled top-level posts that require Senate confirmation, including general counsel, inspector general and other important roles like secretary of the Army and undersecretary of the Navy.
The Pentagon referred a request for comment on its unfilled posts to the White House. A White House official said: “Democrat obstruction has played a key role in jamming up the president's agenda.”
Of the 42 open positions that require Senate confirmation, 29 have no nominee identified, while 13 have nominees awaiting confirmation.
Talking Point
For two of the largest U.S. defense companies, General Dynamics and L3 Technologies, thin staffing at their largest customer was a talking point with investors.
The Defense Department is “working on filling several positions in the Pentagon and that has definitely resulted in a slowdown,” said Ralph D'Ambrosio, chief financial officer of L3, a prime contractor for surveillance, security and detection systems.
Because of the slowdown, the quarter just ended was the lowest second-quarter spending level on record at $62.5 billion, according to a report by data analysis firm Govini, seen by Reuters. The report said “federal procurement resources are stretched thinner than they ever have been.”
Leidos' Krone pointed to the expected one-year delay of the Navy's $3.5 billion NMCI NextGen program to update the intranet used by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps as an example of a big contract delay.
Defense spending for the 2018 fiscal year and beyond was unclear, said Byron Callan, a defense analyst at Capital Alpha Partners, noting that few companies have changed their long-term profit expectations, suggesting that uncertainty has made forecasting more difficult.
“The fact that we didn't have an enacted (fiscal year) 2017 budget until the early part of May, which was seven months into the fiscal year, has definitely slowed down the contracting activity and the obligation activity within the Department of Defense,” said D'Ambrosio.
Some of the positions have been difficult to fill. Two of Trump's nominees for Army secretary, its top professional civilian position, withdrew their names from consideration. The White House then nominated Raytheon lobbyist Mark Esper, and he is awaiting a vote on his confirmation.
General Dynamics CEO Phebe Novakovic said during her company's conference call that “without these appointments, it is difficult to process contracts” and to make progress on defense-related projects.
Novakovic's information systems and technology business unit has thousands of shorter sales-cycle service contracts which can reflect delays quickly.

An undercover New York police detective accused of taking part in a motorcycle gang's assault on a driver on the West Side Highway told his handler in the Police Department the day before the attack that he was joining a citywide motorcycle tour that he expected would cause “mayhem,” the handler testified at a hearing on Tuesday.
The detective, Wojciech Braszczok (pronounced VOY-chek BROOSH-chahk), initially denied that he had been involved in the attack when he first spoke to his handler — two days after the assault, as they met over beers at a restaurant in Midtown Manhattan, the handler, a detective identified in court only by his shield number, testified.
But the witness said that the next day, at a second meeting, Detective Braszczok said he had been present when the victim, Alexian Lien, was dragged from his Range Rover and beaten in September 2013.
At that meeting, which was in Long Island City, Queens, Detective Braszczok told the witness he had seen the other bikers attack the car, heard a loud crack and then took off, without calling the police or intervening. “He said he didn't have his gun and shield with him and there were too many people and he would have been overwhelmed,” the handler testified, looking at Detective Braszczok from the witness stand.
Labour's Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has welcomed the government's decision to start a consultation on the future of LGBT policy in the autumn.
Writing for PinkNews.co.uk on Friday, Culture Secretary and Minister for Equalities, Maria Miller, said the “LGB&T Call for Evidence” consultation was designed help the government prioritise its next line of work for the LGBT community, once the same-sex marriage bill for England and Wales is signed into law.
Details of the consultation's launch date are still to be announced by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.
Shadow Home Secretary and Shadow Minister for Women and Equalities, Yvette Cooper, welcomed news of the consultation, but said the government was already aware of key challenges faced by LGBT people.
“Well there is a whole series of areas that I think are really important,” Ms Cooper said to PinkNews.co.uk at Pride in London on Saturday. “People take for granted that because the law is in place [they think] actually there is equality – there isn't.
“We know there still can be discrimination; we know there can still be homophobic bullying. I particularly am concerned about homophobic bullying in schools, I think there is a lot more we should do and can do.
“I've talked before about the Schools Out programme because I have seen in practice the work that it does – but actually a lot of schools are not doing that sort of thing and that makes a huge difference to teenagers.”
Mentioning homophobic bullying in the work place, Ms Cooper added: “There are a lot of areas where we still need to argue for cultural change; we still need to keep up the campaign for equality, so I hope [the government does] a really broad-ranging consultation that allows people to come forward with all kinds of issues, concerns [and suggestions of] what the next steps are when it comes to equality.”
Asked if she was surprised that the government felt the need to do a consultation when it was already aware of key LGBT issues such as homophobic bullying in schools, Ms Cooper told PinkNews.co.uk: “Well there are certainly a whole series of issues that the government could be getting on and dealing with without the need for a consultation and I hope that people will.
“We are going to keep pressing the case for compulsory sex and relationship education. I think there is a wide range of reasons why we need that. So some of my concerns are about homophobic bullying, but some of my concerns are also about the levels of violence in teenage relationships.”
I love these old mystery schematics where the idiosyncratic drawing style and lack of a readily identifiable energy input system often leave me fairly puzzled as to the true context or viability of the machines.

Kanai's Cube FAQ
I see a lot of questions popping up about Kanai's Cube since its release, so I am hoping to be able to put together a list of common questions, along with helpful information regarding the cube.
When putting in a stack of items, the cube is smart enough to only use what it needs. If a recipe calls for (5) Death's Breath, and you place a stack of (50), you will have (45) back in your inventory when you complete the recipe.
edit: It has been confirmed that the extracted powers will roll over to non-season as other artisans's are. source
While it has not been confirmed how the transition will occur at the end of Season 4, it is reasonably safe to assume that the stored cube powers will be handled much in the same way that artisan levels/plans are - once the season ends it automatically rolls over to your non-season gear.
Where do I find the Cube? The cube is in a new area of Act 3. In order to obtain the item you must make your way through the first floor of the "Ruins of Sescheron", and finally get to the second zone called the "Elder Sanctum". In this second zone you will find the "Tomb of King Kanai", at which point a small scripted event takes place and you will have the cube and its artisan unlocked in town.
Does the cube take up stash space? No, the cube is now part of the town center along with the other artisans (blacksmith, jeweler, etc.).
What can the cube do? All sorts of stuff, from extracting legendary powers to upgrading rares into legendaries. I will get into the specifics of each recipe later, but for now just realize that the cube is a powerful tool.
So the first recipe everyone loves about the cube is the "Archive of Tal Rasha". This recipe allows you to extract a legendary power from an item, in turn destroying the item itself. In order to do this, you must have (1) of each of the new Legendary Crafting Mats (each act gives a new material in their bounty cache's, (1) Legendary item with a Legendary Affix you wish to remove, and (5) Death's Breath.
You are allowed to have an active Weapon Slot, Armor Slot, and Jewelry Slot. Weapons include all items that are equipped in your hands (weapons, off-hands, and shields). Armor includes all armor, so you can choose one item from Helmet, Shoulders, Gloves, Pants, Boots, Belt, Chest, and Bracers. Jewelry includes Amulets and Rings, so you must choose between a 3rd ring or 2nd amulet essentially.
Note that this only applies to legendaries, and you cannot extract a set item in lieu of equipping said item. Example: you cannot extract Zuni's Pants in the hopes that you would no longer have to equip them to get the set bonus. For further clarification, set items that have legendary affixes such as Krelm's Belt can have their legendary affix extracted...but you cannot gain the benefit of the set. So if you use the belt's power in the cube, and equip the bracers, you do not get the set bonus.
Now, lets say you want to extract the legendary power from The Furnace which is "Increases Damage Against Elites by 40-50%". The first thing to know is that no matter the value of the item you put in, the power extracted will always be at its max. So if your Furnace only rolled 40% elite damage, the ability will extract at 50%. Ok, so as stated above, place your Furnace, (1) each of the legendary act specific mats, and (5) deaths breaths in the cube and hit "Transmute". You will get a warning that you are about to destroy your item, that's ok - hit "OK".
Now that the Furnace's power has been extracted, you need to "equip" it. Within the cube GUI, click the icon marked with a sword (you can see it here). This opens up a book of all the available items you can extract, so rifle through the pages and select The Furnace. Once you have, the image of the sword you clicked on will now show the image of The Furnace. If you want to verify that a specific power is activated, you can open up the details screen in your inventory and scroll to the bottom - it will now show any active attributes coming from Kanai's Cube.
There are some items that cannot have their legendary power extracted such as The Corrupted Ashbringer, The Hellfire Amulet, and Ancestors Grace.
Also of note, you cannot utilize two of the same power. In the example of The Furnace, if you have one equipped on your character, and select The Furnace in your cube, you will not get 2x bonus.
Extracted powers work from any legendary item at any level. So if you find a Starmetal Kukri at level 45, it is no longer useless. Save it, and you can extract that very awesome power once you have the cube and the mats.
Extracting the Ring of Royal Grandeur is the same as wearing one (again you can't wear one and have one in the cube). This opens up great gearing options for the 2x ring slots you now have.
Extracted powers are only available to characters that could normally utilize the original item. A barbarian could not use a power from a monk daibo.
At 0730UTC today I received a message, which had been spreading around various industry chat groups:
GIA646 WIII-WAPP at 05.22 req Divert to WAAA and at time 06.26 pilot state distress msg “Mayday 2x.” due to short fuel endurance just only 13 minutes” at position 56 miles east of Mks. A/c normal landing at 06.43 with high priority.
Being my usual curious self, I went to FlightRadar24 and searched for the aircraft. I soon found out the aircraft was operated by a 737-800 with registration PK-GMK, and that the aircraft had left relatively on time from Jakarta (CGK/WIII) towards Ambon (AMQ/WAPP), the aircraft made it to Ambon, then diverted to Makassar (UPG/WAAA).
A search at another site, revealed the following weather information:
METAR: WAPP 310030Z 06003KT 020V080 2000 -RA FEW012CB BKN013 25/24 Q1011 TEMPO TL0100 5000 RMK CB TO E

Back to the replay. The following rough timeline was constructed by me based on the Flightradar24 replay (times in UTC, and there is a 7 minute or so time difference with the report above):
0400 GIA646 abeam of Kendari at FL350
0411 Batik Air A320 departed AMQ
0430 (approx) GIA646 commended descent
0443 Aircraft descended through 10000ft
0447 Aircraft at 6000ft about to enter holding at AUDRI at 6000ft.
0455 Batik Air 737-900ER departed AMQ, and 1 Wings Air ATR72 either before or after it.
0510 Aircraft left holding at AUDRI and passed 4000ft
0514 Aircraft at 400ft and commenced go-around.
0516 Aircraft reached 4000ft amidst missed-approach procedure, to return to AUDRI.
0525 Aircraft left holding fix at AUDRI to divert to Makassar (UPG/WAAA), 1 737-300 (unknown) was holding, and landed not long after. Aircraft did not hold after the missed-approach. Aircraft cruised at FL340 during the diversion and nothing out of the ordinary was observed.
0613 Top of Descent inbound UPG/WAAA
0634 Aircraft commenced approach
0636 Aircraft landed at UPG/WAAA
0709 A Lion Air 737-900ER landed at AMQ/WAPP
Before GIA646 arrived on scene, several aircraft had been holding due to weather at Ambon, but all had landed by the time it entered the area. From here it can be ascertained that apart from the bad weather and the go-around, nothing was unusual and it made little sense for the aircraft to declare Mayday due to low fuel upon descent to Makassar, unless a major screw up in the fuel planning occured, which was unlikely.
Let's look back at what was reported:
GIA646 WIII-WAPP at 05.22 req Divert to WAAA and at time 06.26 pilot state distress msg “Mayday 2x.” due to short fuel endurance just only 13 minutes” at position 56 miles east of Mks. A/c normal landing at 06.43 with high priority.
If they only had 13 minutes of fuel left, why didn't they declare the emergency before, after all, they declared it amidst their descent.
There is a possibility that there is a misunderstanding about the nature of the emergency and the requirement of fuel reserves. When planning your flight, under IFR rules in Indonesia, you must carry enough fuel to go from Origin to Destination, plus fuel to go from your Destination to you Alternate, and hold over your alternate for if I remember correctly, 30 minutes. You must also land with a final reserve of 30 minutes flight.
When do you declare your Mayday if you are low on fuel? The obvious answer is to declare a Mayday if you are sure your estimated fuel remaining after landing is going to be less than 30 minutes endurance.
Now while we don't know the facts at the moment, we know that GIA646 did not have an excessive holding period near Ambon, and for it to claim to have only 13 minutes left of fuel while still on descent would constitute a massive screw up, I mean, MASSIVE! After the previous transport minister said “airlines should follow Garuda's example”, and making rules requiring “face-to-face briefing between dispatchers and pilots,” if that aircraft did have only 13 minutes of fuel left, it just shows that those rules were just a burden with little or no use to generally accepted normal methodologies used in the world.
When the crew reported having only 13 minutes endurance at 0626, what was most likely was that they were going to land with less than 30 minutes of fuel on board, or, 43 minutes of fuel left. The aircraft landed at 0643, which was 17 minutes later, the Mayday call was justified.
A quick look at CASR Part 830.2 indicate that this is a serious incident as it involves:
830.2 b. 15) Fuel quantity requiring the declaration of an emergency by the pilot.
Now, this is where it gets interesting. Since the Air Asia 8501 accident, many had become concerned that the Directorate General of Civil Aviation were either by their own will, or by the instructions of the then Transport Minister (who seemed to have gone on a rampage to blame LCCs and calling them as unsafe, and insisted that the industry should follow Garuda), as it put in several punitive regulations when it came to accidents and serious incidents. For this case, this would include:
The suspension of routes, in this case the suspension of GIA646's schedule until conclusion of the NTSC investigation. Barring the carrier, in this case, Garuda, from adding new routes and frequencies anywhere pending the investigation's completion. Preventive grounding of the pilots involved, until the completion of the accident investigation.
Points 1 and 2 are, in the opinion of many in the industry (in Indonesia and the rest of the world), utterly useless, and may be aimed at sabotaging business recovery of airlines suffering these mishaps, likely under the premise of the then minister's alleged favoritism of Garuda. Point 3, may appear normal but in Indonesia's case at the moment, the grounding has always been extended to the whole investigation period (that is, until the publication of the final report, even if the interim report does not deem the crew actions to be a factor).
The challenge now for the DGCA and the current minister is to either:
Prove impartiality by giving Garuda equal treatment to the other airlines that suffered serious incidents since these “silly rules” were put in place; or Remove these “silly rules” and restore common sense into our industry.
If the transport minister had not changed, option 2 is out of the question, and option 1 would basically be slapping himself in the face. Regulatory partiality has been proven by one previous serious incident involving Citilink (Part of Garuda) that occurred since the “silly rules” were in force, escaping the punitive treatment by the DGCA, of which the saddest part of all is that some high ranking officials (well, I know at least one) there didn't even know that it had happened.
I do hope that now, under the new minister, swift decision will be taken into putting alternative 1 in force while waiting for alternative 2 to take place. After all, the new minister had already announced he would make a wholesale review of rules that were counter-productive, which gives us in the industry a big ray of hope, and we do hope it includes these so-called “silly rules.”
Empowered Patient, a regular feature from CNN Medical News correspondent Elizabeth Cohen, helps put you in the driver's seat when it comes to health care.
You can be an informed, empowered patient without alienating your doctor by remembering common courtesy.
ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A few months ago, Dr. David Golden says, he had to fire a patient for being obnoxious.
The patient had a cough. After examining him, Golden recommended a medication. But then the patient did his own research and became worried about side effects.
"He said, 'But I read about this on the Internet, and I know this and I know that, and I know I'm right,' " remembered Golden, an allergist in Baltimore, Maryland.
Golden says he tried to explain why the side effects weren't as bad as the patient thought, and why the medicine would take care of his cough. "But he wasn't open to discussing anything. He countermanded everything I said. So I told him, 'You know it all, so go take care of yourself. I'm not your doctor anymore.' "
Golden says he's all for empowered and educated patients, but some patients have become so empowered, they're actually putting their care in jeopardy.
"I've been doing this for 28 years, and unquestionably it's gotten much worse," Golden says.
But wait a second. Isn't it good to question your doctor? You don't want to passively accept everything they say, right? Absolutely, say Golden and other physicians. The doctors we interviewed agreed that getting the best care means being empowered but not obnoxious. Here are tips from a few of them, plus some from a patient.
1. Don't demand medications over the phone
Let's say you get sinus infections several times a year. You know what they feel like. The same medicine helps you each and every time. You want your doctor's office to call the prescription in to the pharmacy. Why should you go in and get examined when you know what's wrong with you? Sounds reasonable, right?
This issue rankles doctors like none other. Doctors don't like prescribing medicine without first seeing the patient, period.
"When my staff asks them to come in, they say they're too busy and they know what's wrong with them. It's a very common thing," says Dr. Jeff Hurwitz, an internist in Hagerstown, Maryland. "But health care isn't just saying, 'These are my symptoms. I know what's wrong with me.' Medicine is an art. You need to go see your doctor."
Hurwitz remembers one patient who demanded medicine for a urinary tract infection over the phone; she'd had them before, and she was having one again. Hurwitz insisted she come in to be seen. She insisted she wouldn't. He won, and it's a good thing for her: It turned out her symptoms were caused by kidney cancer, not a urinary tract infection.
2. Don't come in loaded with Internet printouts
Trisha Torrey, the moderator of about.com's Patient Empowerment section, recommends making bullet points after reading information on the Internet. "Don't bother printing copies of your research for [your doctor.] She doesn't have time to read them," she says. (Click here for Torrey's advice about using the Internet for your health care.
Another piece of advice: Be careful how you bring up Internet information. Sounding like you know more than the doctor does could result in alienating your doctor and getting less than optimal care.
Let's say, for example, you've been having horrible headaches. Your doctor thinks it's nothing serious and you just need a good over-the-counter pain medication, but you're worried the pain in your head might be something more serious.
You go online and read all about what a headache could be (a brain tumor, for example), and now you want to talk to your physician. Dr. Delia Chiaramonte, a patient advocate in Baltimore, has these do's and don'ts:
Health Library MayoClinic.com: Health Library
Don't say, '"Please look at these printouts. They say I should have a CT scan to rule out a tumor. You really need to read these -- when doctors don't listen to patients, the patients die."
So what should you say? "Acknowledge the slight discomfort of the situation out loud," advises Chiaramonte. "Say, 'I know doctors may not love patients coming in with Internet printouts. But would you mind looking at these? I'd love to hear your thoughts,'" Chiaramonte says, adding that you should ask your doctor for Web sites he or she recommends.
Dr. Scott Haig, an orthopedist in New York, agrees. He says he doesn't mind when patients come in with Internet information -- it's all about how they ask about it. He says don't make your doctor feel like his back is up against the wall. "Permit for an exchange of ideas," he says. (To read a Time magazine column that Dr. Haig wrote about one of his obnoxious patients, click here .)
3. Arrive organized
Christine Miserandino has learned a thing or two from her frequent doctor's appointments for lupus. Miserandino, who writes about her illness on her Web site, says that before each appointment, she fills out three index cards: one with any new problems she needs to tell her doctor about, one describing her current symptoms, and a third with specific questions for the doctor.
Miserandino says this gets her better care. "My doctor is busy, and I have to respect that he has 40 patients in one day," she says. "If I don't go in with all my questions written down, I'd be rambling all over the place.
4. Need a lot of time? Ask first.
Doctors often schedule appointments in 15-minute increments. Sometimes you'll need much more than that. Miserandino says she always warns the appointment secretary when she'll need extra time, and asks whether a certain time of day (such as the last appointment) would be better.
Chiaramonte also suggests asking whether certain days of the week are bad (perhaps your doctor has several surgeries scheduled on certain days), and says you can also request two appointments back to back.
5. Exercise basic human kindness
Remember, your doctor is a human being, and we all respond better when we're treated well.
"Show human courtesy and respect who they are. I'm talking basic human interaction 101," Haig says.
Miserandino says she doesn't shy away from asking tough questions -- on the contrary, she asks lots of them and sometimes questions her doctor's recommendations -- but she always does it politely. Plus, she fosters a relationship with her doctor because she knows that to a great extent, her health depends on him.
"I do care, because I want him to care about me. I do bring cookies at Christmastime. It's a relationship you have to foster like any other."
Once, when her doctor went above and beyond what he had to do by visiting her in the hospital twice in one day, she wrote him a thank-you note. "He said to me, in the 20-odd years I've been doing this, I've never received a thank-you note. I always hear the negative, never the positive," she says. E-mail to a friend

Itan Wali, Pakistan (CNN) -- In this village in Pakistan's Punjab province a tearful 12-year-old girl ponders if the Pakistani government will soon hang her mother.
"Whenever I see her picture I cry," Isham Masih told CNN. "I want my mother back. That's what I'm praying for."
This month a Pakistani court sentenced Isham's mother, 45-year-old Asia Bibi, to death, not because she killed, injured or stole, but simply because she said something.
Prosecutors say Bibi, who is a Christian, broke Pakistan's strict blasphemy law by insulting Islam and the prophet Muhammad, a crime punishable by death or life imprisonment according to Pakistan's penal code.
The alleged incident happened in June 2009 when Bibi, a field worker, was picking fruit in a village two hours west of Lahore. Prosecutors say when Bibi dipped her cup into a bucket of drinking water during a lunch break, her co-workers complained the water had been contaminated by a non-Muslim.
Court records show the women got into a heated argument.
Mafia Satar said she was there and heard Bibi's insults.
"She said your Muhammad had worms in his mouth before he died," Satar told CNN, a crude way of saying Muhammad was no prophet.
The town cleric, Qari Muhammad Salim, reported the incident to police who arrested Bibi. After nearly 15 months in prison came her conviction and the death sentence.
"When I heard the decision my heart ached," Bibi's husband Ashiq Masih told CNN.
Masih denies his wife ever insulted Muhammad. He said death threats forced him and his daughters, one of them disabled, to flee their village.
Neither the Koran nor the prophet Muhammad's teachings in the Hadith call for the execution of blasphemers, but Islamic scholars and jurists from generations past included the death sentence when drafting Islamic law.
Human rights groups have long blamed Pakistan's blasphemy laws for persecution and violence against religious minorities like last year's attack on a Christian village in Punjab Province and recent bombings of minority Muslim mosques.
Activists say the government has refused to amend the law for fear of backlash from Islamist groups and their followers who deem scrapping the law as un-Islamic.
At the time this report was filed, Pakistan's law minister had not responded to CNN's request for an interview.
Bibi has appealed her death sentence and asked for bail, the chief prosecutor of Punjab province told CNN.
The prosecutor, Chaudhry Muhammad Jahangir, said the appeal will be heard by the Lahore High court and a decision could be months away.
Pakistan has never executed someone convicted of blasphemy but in Bibi's village public opinion was unanimous.
"Yes, she should be hanged," a group of villagers cried out.
The town cleric, who made the initial complaint against Bibi, called her death sentence one of the happiest moments of his life.
"Tears of joy poured from my eyes," Qari Salim told CNN.
The clerics tears are in stark contrast to those shed by Bibi's daughter Isham, who wants her mother to live.
The Smell of Spring Brings Another Year To Bleed Dodger Blue
This week we take a 30 mile drive up the I-5 to Chavez Ravine and take a look at the 2017, Los Angeles Dodgers. Living in the Greater LA Area during a time when the Lakers are bad, I have noticed that the Dodgers seem to be the toast of the town (although the Clippers have recently been well represented). Everyone is wearing Dodger caps and the buzz that was so loud in October is starting to return. Dodger fans sometimes get a bad rap, as they often show up in the 3rd inning and leave during the 7th inning stretch. The fans that I have been talking to that “bleed Dodger Blue” would say that those are not true Dodger fans. Those “fans” are the businessmen entertaining guests from out of town and trying to finalize a transaction of some kind. The true fans, sit out in the bleachers or the nose-bleed seats because those are what is available to the average fan. These fans do have a lot to be excited about in 2017.
2016 was a fantastic year for the Dodgers as they finished with a record of 91-71 putting them in 1st place, four games ahead of the hated San Francisco Giants. They went on to slip past the Washington Nations in five games during the NLDS. The season did end on a down note after being knocked out of the NLCS by the Chicago Cubs in six games. How will the club respond to falling just short of the World Series? Well they definitely have no intention of accepting this defeat. The All-Star brain-trust of Andrew Friedman, Farhan Zaidi, Josh Byrnes and Alex Anthopoulos got to work and immediately begin re-signing key players and establishing depth with some new pieces
Key Off-Season Transactions
Re-Signed:
Rich Hill LHP (Free Agent) Kenley Jansen CL (FA) Justin Turner 3B (FA) Yasmani Grandal C (Arbitration Eligible) Chase Utley INF (FA)
Perhaps the most important transactions of the off-season wasn't who was added or lost, but who they were able to re-sign. Locking down one of the premiere closers in the game and a significant Left-handed starter that slots in the #3 spot in the rotation is “huge.” In addition, they retained Justin Turner who had a career year at 3B and starting catcher, Yasmani Grandal. Utley rounds out the group as the utility infielder. He may be a little long in the tooth, but your infield is pretty damn good if Utley is coming off your bench. These were key signings to “keep the band together” for another run this year, hopefully deeper into October.
Additions:
Logan Forsythe 2B (trade with TB) Sergio Romo RP (signed as FA) Darnell Sweeney MI (trade with PHI) Franklin Gutierrez OF (signed as FA)
There were not many new faces added this off-season and of these was former Farmhand, Darnell Sweeney, returning to the fold. Then they trade for Logan Forsythe and greatly strengthen their lineup while making it that Sweeney is unlikely to see Dodger Stadium this year unless there is a significant injury. Romo should bolster mediocre bullpen (other than Kenley of course) and Gutierrez provides some depth in the outfield. Personally, I would have rather seen them give Trayce Thompson a shot but Gutierrez does have experience in a platoon situation which is likely how the Dodgers will play it in LF this season.
Subtractions:
Brett Anderson (FA) Josh Reddick (FA) Jesse Chavez (FA) Joe Blanton (FA) JP Howell (FA) Carlos Ruiz (trade with SEA) Howie Kendrick (trade with PHI) Jose De Leon (trade with TB)
I was surprised to see them move their top pitching prospect in Jose De Leon to Tampa. If the Dodgers truly believe that Forsythe is the missing piece to get them into the World Series, than it was worth it to trade from strength. From the perspective of someone who primarily places in dynasty leagues, De Leon is tough to give up for a 30-year-old with one year left on his contract with only one more year as a Club option after that. Reddick was a nice piece, but they were never going to re-sign him. He was an expensive late season push to the Promised Land that just fell short. The rest on this list will most likely have their spots filled with equal talent.
Projected Opening Day Roster Notables
Lineup
Logan Forsythe 2B (R) Corey Seager SS (L) Justin Turner 3B (R) Adrian Gonzalez 1B (L) Yasmani Grandal C (S) Joc Pederson CF (L) Yaisel Puig RF (R) Andrew Toles LF (L) / Franklin Gutierrez LF (R) PITCHER
Although there isn't anyone that would fit the traditional lead-off hitter profile, they don't really need one. There is power from slots 1 through 7 and it is extremely long for a National League lineup. I love how this lineup slots in as almost perfectly alternating between left-handed and right-handed batters. If Puig has a bounce-back season like I believe he will, the top 7 guys in the lineup could realistically ALL hit 20+ HRs this season. On the flip side, they might struggle to steal 20 bases combined. Last season the team was in the middle of the pack in the NL in most offensive categories. I expect improvements in nearly every offensive categories (except SB) and the support will make this starting rotation even scarier. Adrian Gonzalez will be 35 this season and had a somewhat down year in 2016. Look for him to earn his $22 million this year as he anchors a fearsome lineup and gets back to 25 HRs and 100 RBIs.
Rotation
Clayton Kershaw LHP Kenta Meada RHP Rich Hill LHP Scott Kazmir LHP Brandon McCarthy RHP
If Scott Kazmir pitches like he did in the first half of 2016, the Dodgers could have four guys in the rotation in the top 35 overall starting pitchers in baseball. With Ryu slated to come back from elbow surgery and Julio Urias lurking in AAA, there is no lack of starting pitching in Dodger Country. Every time that Clayton Kershaw takes the mound, its a must-see event. I am going to do everything I can to get to a Kershaw/Bumgardner battle this season. Rich Hill will solidify the rotation as he will be there for the entire season. As mentioned earlier, the lineup should give the rotation confidence to go out and pitch their game knowing the offense can pick them up if they are having a tough day.
Bullpen
Kenley Jansen CL Pedro Baez 8th Sergio Romo 7th
Jansen is arguably the top closer in Major League baseball. After that, Baez and Romo represent decent set-up options with tons of experience. What they are lacking in the young fire-baller that so many teams are putting in their rotation to get outs in high-leverage situations. The Dodgers will be counting on experience over stuff and may find that their bullpen is a little too short. This is certainly an area that will need to be addressed in July.
Prospects to Know for 2017
Brock Stewart (RHP) made his debut last season, but with a full rotation to start off the year, he gets to develop his slider and regain the command in AAA. If some of the veteran pitchers get banged up and/or need some rest this season, Stewart could get the call after Urias. Cody Bellinger (1B/OF) is the Dodgers top hitting prospect and is ready for the Major Leagues. He's being cock-blocked by Adrian Gonzalez, but spent some time in the OF in 2016 and could find himself earning a call up later in the season if the Toles/Gutierrez combo isn't working out. His power should play at the top level and even if is contact suffers, his plate discipline will average it out with a decent OBP.
Key Spring Training Position Battle
Left Field
As mentioned previously, it is likely that Toles and Gutierrez will use a straight platoon. Trayce is coming back from injury so he is not likely to be fully ready by Opening Day. The wildcard is Andre Either. He slots in as the 4th outfielder, but could also get more at bats if the “dynamic” platoon duo falters.
5th Starter
This is likely Brandon McCarthy's spot to lose. Julio Urias wants that spot badly and could earn in this spring, but the Dodgers will likely go with veterans where they can so they can try and build a lead early in the season.
Fantasy Targets
Of course everyone wants Clayton Kershaw. I, for one, won't spend a high enough pick on a pitcher to every be able to get him. My pitching target here is Scott Kazmir. I believe he bounces back this season if he's healthy due to improved run-support and less pressure with three stud pitchers in front of him in the rotation. He can be a nice 4th/5th starter for your fantasy teams that can be grabbed in the late rounds. On the hitting side, if I'm starting a dynasty league, I consider drafting Corey Seager very high as a player to build a franchise around. If its a keeper league, I might reach a round early to secure him. Other than Seager, I like A-Gone to bounce back this year and look to grab him in the middle rounds and enjoy early round production from my first baseman.
2017 Team Outlook
The Dodgers will be good again this season. They secured their best players, added a few extra pieces and built enough depth to stay out of a significant losing streak. If Puig and A-Gone improve on down years and Forsythe is a spark at the top of the lineup, this team can win 95-97 games this season. Vegas set the bar at 94 1/2 for 2017 and I think there should beat that. The Cubs and Nats will be tough to get by in the playoffs this season, but I do expect the Dodgers to repeat as NL West champs and hold of the Giants. After all, it is not an even year and the Cubs snapped that magic crap last season.

When it came down to choosing the host city for next year's Memorial Cup — a big deal since it's the 100th anniversary of the Canadian junior hockey championship — Hamilton should have been the favourite. It had so many things going for it.
It's close to Toronto and all the biggest media outlets which would've meant heavy coverage and extensive exposure. It's smack in the middle of the most-populous part of the country and within a short driving distance of six other OHL fan bases. The Bulldogs will be peaking competitively by the time the event rolls around.
Most of all, its arena has more than 17,000 seats which was nearly three times that of Regina's Brandt Centre which seemingly made it perfect to make the Canadian Hockey League some serious dough. Even if the place wasn't full and only attracted 9,000 fans a game, that's still 2,000 more tickets sold per night than the alternative could offer.
So how bad must the selection committee have thought FirstOntario Centre was to ignore all those benefits and choose somewhere else? Answer: Very.
Make no mistake, the arena was the issue. As The Spectator's Teri Pecoskie explains in the paper Tuesday, Canadian Hockey League president David Branch specifically pointed to the rink as the reason the Cup won't be held here. It simply wasn't good enough.
Three decades have taken a toll. In the sports world, it's now a relic.
For years, there have been discussions about what should be done with the place. Should it be renovated a little? Should it be gutted and thoroughly redesigned? Should it be torn down and replaced with something smaller?
There's never been a level of urgency to resolve that. But the fact that a major sports organization, aided by a number of big-time movers and shakers in the sports world who made up the selection committee, have essentially written off the building suggest we're at a crossroads. We either have to do something about it or accept we're in the senior ages of the arena's life and decide we can live without hosting some major sports events — and the economic spinoffs that accompany such things — that might've come years ago. Before long, possibly other things, too.
A Memorial Cup? Bulldogs owner Michael Andlauer says Branch's comments suggest we're never getting one with the arena as it is now.
"Status quo can't be tolerated," Andlauer says. "It needs to be looked at and it can't be put on the side burner until the next election."
Chris Jones said it himself. You win in the Canadian Football League with solid quarterbacking and strong Canadian depth.
Enter Vince Young.
The highly touted University of Texas star had an up and down NFL career that eventually flamed out with failed appearances at training camps, ending in 2014.
He hasn't thrown a pass in a regular season game in 2011 and that has a lot of Rider fans asking ‘why?'.
Why would Chris Jones even bother with the soon-to-be 34-year old quarterback after he just passed on a franchise player like Darian Durant, who is just one year older.
Why would Chris Jones potentially take repetitions away from younger prospect quarterbacks who could turn into the ‘next one' in Saskatchewan?
Vince Young is definitely not the next one. The next quarterback to take the reins like Darian Durant in 2009 and steer them for seven seasons.
Vince Young is a Hail Mary.
No one has any idea what we are going to see from Young the first time he steps on the field. Reports are he's going to go through a combine like preparation over the next several weeks to get into football shape.
To get his throwing mechanics back in order and to get acclimatized to the CFL football, field and game plan.
Yes, May and the start of training camp will come quickly.
So why would Chris Jones bother?
I respond with, why not?
Can Chris Jones afford to take a pass on any option that comes his way?
No. He said he'd turn over every stone to find a quarterback who could turn his team in the basement dwellers they have been in the West Division the last two years and turn them into a playoff contender, if not Grey Cup contender in 2017.
Now we find ourselves with the big name, Vince Young and a lot more questions than just why.
Will this signing impact any of the other five quarterbacks under contract. Kevin Glenn, Brandon Bridge, Jake Waters, G.J. Kinne and Bryan Bennett have to be curious about the Riders bringing in such a player like Vince Young.
Already Kevin Glenn was a little defensive, albeit jokingly, about Stampeder quarterback Bo Levi Mitchell's tweet, welcoming the fellow Texan to the CFL as if he was going to be the starter.
Kevin Glenn is still the best quarterback on the Riders roster. To that there is no question. Glenn is (and I know he's not a fan of this moniker) the insurance policy.
Glenn is the high watermark all other quarterbacks will have to exceed to even have a shot at starting for the team coming out of camp.
I doubt Vince Young will surpass him, but you never know.
The other aspect of all of this hype about the Texas Longhorns legend is this could all be over sooner rather than later.
Nothing is stopping Chris Jones from evaluating Young like any other player and releasing him. That's worse case scenario for Jones.
Will that be considered a waste of time?
Maybe.
Now we should consider the best case scenario. A 34-year old Young impresses and wins games in the next two years (at least). That's more than can be said for quarterbacks who have played in Saskatchewan not named Darian Durant over the last three years.
The positives out weigh the negatives but it's going to be a great show to watch play out.
And football is the entertainment business after all.
German authorities say a claim of rape by a 13-year-old girl from a Russian immigrant family in Berlin that had caused tensions between Russia and Germany was fabricated.
The girl, who disappeared on January 11 before reappearing the next day, had told police she was kidnapped and raped by what her family said were Middle East migrants.
"It was clear to us from the start that the rape story, as she recounted it to us, could not have been true," Martin Steltner, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Berlin, told RFE/RL.
Steltner said data from the girl's mobile phone showed she had spent the night of her disappearance at the home of a 19-year-old male friend, in an apparent attempt to avoid conflict with her parents over what Steltner described as "school problems."
"We questioned him. We also found some of her belongings there," he said.
Prosecutors found no evidence of sexual crimes.
No charges were lodged against the man, who is now acting as a witness in the ongoing investigation.
Migrant Claims
The case has added to tension between Germany and Russia, whose ties have been strained by Moscow's takeover of Crimea in 2014 and its support for separatists in a war in eastern Ukraine.
It triggered widespread outrage in Russia after the country's most watched television network, state-run Channel One, gave the rape allegation prominent place in a January 16 report by its Berlin correspondent, Ivan Blagoy.
Blagoy's report quoted the girl's relatives as saying that police had refused to launch criminal proceedings in an attempt to cover up the case, and had pressured the girl to say the sex was consensual.
One of the alleged assailants "barely spoke German," Blagoy quoted the girl's aunt as saying.
The case came to light weeks after authorities in another German city, Cologne, were criticized for what was widely seen as a slow response to a spate of sexual assaults and robberies of women allegedly carried out by Middle Eastern and North African men on New Year's Eve.
In the aftermath of Blagoy's report, Russian immigrant communities in Berlin and other German cities organized rallies to voice their anger. On January 23, some 700 people protested in front of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's office, holding banners that read "Our children are in danger" and "Today my child, tomorrow yours."
Kremlin Pressure
The Russian government also began to press the German authorities on the case as the investigation continued.
At a high-profile annual press conference on January 26, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that "the girl certainly did not voluntarily disappear for 30 hours" and called for "truth and justice."
He said he hoped the German authorities would not "attempt to cover up the reality for some domestic, politically correct reason."
His comments prompted German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman to warn Moscow not to politicize the case. Lavrov responded by urging the German authorities to disclose all the details of its investigation into the girl's claims.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on January 29 that confusion about the case could have been avoided if German authorities had been more forthcoming about the investigation.
"I would like to say that the situation has been very complicated since the very beginning," Zakharova was quoted by state-run Russian news agency TASS as saying. "We learned about this situation not from our German colleagues, but thanks to the media."
She added that Lavrov and Steinmeier planned to discuss the matter in a telephone call on January 29.
In a short statement issued later in the day, the Russian Foreign Ministry did not indicate that the two men discussed the case during the call, which focused on Ukraine and Syria peace efforts.
Berlin's state interior minister, Frank Henkel, praised local authorities for what he called the professionalism with which they handled the investigation amid the media firestorm.
"The new developments clearly expose the propaganda that was linked to this case in the past few days," Henkel said in a January 29 statement.
Henkel added that Germany was a "state based on the rule of law" and that no "political pressure from abroad" would change its "constitutional principles."
Steltner of the Berlin prosecutor's office told RFE/RL earlier this week that two men were under investigation for possible past sexual contact with the girl, which under German law can be prosecuted as child abuse since she is under 14.
Steltner said neither man was a recent migrant; one is a German citizen and the other, a long-term resident, has a Turkish passport.
That investigation is ongoing, Steltner said on January 29.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Colombian president has said he is "convinced" that Colombians will support a peace agreement being negotiated with Farc
Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has said he will face major political problems if the Colombian people reject a peace agreement being negotiated with the Farc rebel group.
"I will be in serious difficulty," he told the BBC's HARDtalk programme.
"But I am absolutely convinced that the overwhelming majority of the Colombians will support me," he added.
Government negotiators have been engaged in talks with the left-wing rebels in Cuba since November 2012.
It is expected that a peace accord will be signed in March 2016, putting an end to more than five decades of conflict.
Mr Santos has made it clear that the agreement will only be implemented if it is approved by the Colombian people.
"If we sign the final agreement around March, let's say, then the plebiscite will be done a couple of months afterwards," he told the BBC's Stephen Sackur.
Mr Santos insisted that if the agreement was to be rejected by Colombians, the deal with the Farc would be off despite more than three years of negotiations.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Mr Santos (left) and Farc leader Timochenko shook hands after a meeting facilitated by Cuban President Raul Castro (centre)
The Farc has criticised the idea of a referendum, saying it was never meant to be part of the process.
'No more extraditions'
There has been agreement on four broad points on the agenda: the political participation of the rebels, land rights, drug trafficking, and most recently, transitional justice.
Transitional justice - how rebels who have committed crimes will be punished - had been considered one of the thorniest issues on the agenda.
When the two sides announced a deal on the issue on 23 September, President Santos flew to Cuba.
The president shook hands for the first time with the Farc leader, Rodrigo Londono Echeverri, known as Timochenko.
He also set a deadline of six months for the signing of a final peace agreement.
In the BBC interview, Mr Santos said that Timochenko and other rebel leaders would be welcomed in Colombian politics after the implementation of the accord.
"The whole idea of a peace process is to have the people who are in arms to give up their arms and continue doing their politics through legal means," he said.
When the deal is finalised, Colombia will reject any request from the United States to extradite Timochenko and some 70 other Farc members sought for drug trafficking and other offences, Mr Santos added.
Colombia's armed conflict

•An estimated 220,000 killed
•More than five million internally displaced
•More than seven million registered victims
•About 8,000 Farc rebels continue fighting

What is at stake in the Colombian peace process?
The interview will be broadcast at 04:30 GMT, Thursday, 19 November and repeated at 09:30 GMT, 16:30 GMT and 20:30 GMT. It will be repeated on Friday, 20 November, at 04:30 GMT and 09:30 GMT.
Clarification: The headline and wording of this article have been amended to make clear that President Santos said he would face major political problems if the peace deal was rejected.
Rarely can one person change the course of history for an entire country. Elijah Harper did.
In the Manitoba legislature in 1990, Mr. Harper clutched an eagle feather as he blocked the passage of the Meech Lake accord – the agreement that had been negotiated between Ottawa and the provinces to bring Quebec into the constitutional fold.
The scuttling of the deal gave new life to the separatist movement and was the backdrop to ensuing years of tensions between Quebec and federalist forces.

Mr. Harper died Friday at the age of 64 of cardiac failure due to complications from diabetes.
His wife, Anita Olsen Harper, and his family issued a statement describing him as a wonderful man, father and partner.
"He was a true leader and visionary in every sense of the word," said the statement. "He will have a place in Canadian history, forever, for his devotion to public service and uniting his fellow First Nations with pride, determination and resolve. Elijah will also be remembered for bringing aboriginal and non-aboriginal people together to find a spiritual basis for healing and understanding. We will miss him terribly and love him forever."
Mr. Harper was educated at a residential school and later studied at the University of Manitoba. He was elected leader of the Red Sucker Lake First Nation when he was 29 years old.
In 1981, he became the representative for Rupertsland in the Manitoba legislature, the first First Nations person in the province to serve as an MLA. In 1986, he was appointed to the Manitoba cabinet as minister without portfolio for Native Affairs, and in 1987, as Minister of Northern Affairs.
But he was best known for his historic role in blocking the Meech Lake accord that had been negotiated by Progressive Conservative prime minister Brian Mulroney.
The agreement needed to be ratified by the federal Parliament and all of the provinces.

Mr. Harper and other native leaders opposed it because it did not guarantee rights to aboriginal peoples. So, when Manitoba politicians were asked whether they would give unanimous consent to speed up debate on the accord, Mr. Harper quietly said "No."
That meant the province could not ratify the deal before the deadline. And because Manitoba did not give its blessing to the accord, it died.
"There was no looking back," Mr. Harper said years later in an interview with The Globe and Mail in 2003. "It wasn't done out of being negative, or out of spite, or anything. We were just trying to be recognized for our rightful place in Canada."
Mr. Harper said that he was worried about saying no. Had he not had the support of native leaders and that eagle feather which was found on a trapline by his brother, Saul, he said he didn't know if he would have found the strength.
His long-time friend, Syed Bokhari, said Friday that Mr. Harper had a kidney transplant some months ago and appeared to be improving, but recovery from that sort of operation is always uncertain.
"He was a very important person," said Mr. Bokhari. "Politics aside he was a genuine person. He had a heart and he connected with people."

Mr. Harper spent much of his final years visiting First Nations, meeting with indigenous leaders across North America, working with charities, and doing international humanitarian work, his family said.
"Elijah's commitment and dedication to asserting and upholding First Nation rights and recognition has helped lay a solid foundation as this hard work continues today," Shawn Atleo, the National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said in a statement after the announcement of Mr. Harper's death.
"Elijah's drive and actions toward reconciliation," Mr. Atleo said, "will continue to be a legacy for First Nation and all Canadians as we move toward improved and renewed relationships based on mutual respect and recognition – two things he stood firm on in all of his work."

The sure-to-be popular show also will feature BB-8, Yoda and an Ewok, according to the DIA. In addition, more than 150 items and sketches will help illustrate the process of creating the apparel and accessories of the "Star Wars" universe that sprang from the vision of director George Lucas. .
And there will be videos and interactive elements about the work of concept artists and costume designers for the movie franchise.
“This exhibition allows visitors to explore the creative processes behind the art of costume design, while discovering the unexpected ways in which these works relate to art from the DIA's collection,” said DIA director Salvador Salort-Pons in a press statement.
“It also connects directly with our Detroit Film Theatre program, which has shared the art of film with hundreds of thousands of visitors over its 42-year history.”
The ticketed exhibition was put together by the Smithsonian Institution's traveling exhibit experts in partnership with the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, which will be constructed in Los Angeles.
Detroit will be the sixth city on its tour, which launched in 2015 in Seattle.
Ticket prices have yet to be determined, but tickets should be available by April 2018, according to the DIA.
The latest movie in the "Star Wars" series, "Star Wars: The Last Jedi," is due Dec. 15.

Sex bomb: Jilted lover arrested for 'making exploding sex toy to send to ex-lover for Christmas'
Accused: Terry Allen Lester has been charged after police found an explosive sex toy in his luggage
A jilted lover has been arrested after he allegedly wedged gunpowder, buck shot and BB shot into a sex toy to make it explosive.
Police claim that Terry Allen Lester planned to hand the device, found in a container labelled ‘Christmas Gifts', to one of three ex-girlfriends over Yuletide.
The 37-year-old from Waseca, Minnesota, has been charged with felony creation, possession of an explosive or incendiary device and felony terroristic threats.
He faces a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and a £13,000 fine if convicted.
On New Year's Day police officer Kari Kalow responded to a call about a civil matter and went to a residence in Waseca.
According to the woman who made the call, Mr Lester had been residing with her and another woman at her apartment – but he was forced to leave hastily when the manager learned about him staying.
Mr Lester was evicted from the apartment on New Year's Eve, but he left behind some bags – and he had told one of the women what was in the luggage.
The contents of the bags made the women uncomfortable so they contacted the police and took them to Mrs Kalow.
One of the bags included a container with the words ‘Christmas Gifts' written in black marker – and in there were some sex toys.
According to the criminal complaint, Mr Lester had made some modifications to a sex toy.
He allegedly put gun powder, BB shot and buck shot from shotgun shells into one with black and red wires that connected to a trigger with a battery port. However there was no battery inside the device.
The complaint went on to say that Mr Lester planned on giving it to one of three women – in each of those cases, the relationship had ended badly.
Also left at the apartment were tools used in the construction of the explosive device, including cords, cables, a small tool kit and two other sex toys.
The Bloomington Bomb Squad was contacted by Waseca Police Sergeant Scott Girtler.
The squad arrived two hours later and X-rayed the devices after first inspecting them.
The first device, the one shown to Mrs Kalow earlier, had two wires coming out of it that were connected to what appeared to be a trigger from a cordless drill.
The other two devices appeared to be unaltered and checked out.
The bomb squad cut into the first device and removed the projectiles and gunpowder, rendering it inert.
Lester remains in police custody.

LaDainian Tomlinson retired last week without a Super Bowl ring, but he doesn't view that as an indication that his career is incomplete.
Tomlinson noted on NBC SportsTalk that football is a team sport, and no matter how much a player does individually, he can't get a Super Bowl ring on his own. And when asked whether he'd rather have a Super Bowl ring but not get into the Hall of Fame, or be a Hall of Famer without a Super Bowl ring, he didn't hesitate.
“Hall of Fame player without a ring, because you've got to sacrifice so much individually just to be good,” Tomlinson said. “They draft you individually and you've got to back them up and make them right. I think at the end of the day, even though I didn't win a Super Bowl ring, I felt like I backed them up for drafting me. I backed up the San Diego Chargers for picking me with the fifth pick.”
Tomlinson is right: Induction in the Hall of Fame is a greater accomplishment than earning a Super Bowl ring. Plenty of bench warmers have rings, but only great players are in the Hall of Fame.
Here's the interview, in which Tomlinson calls Lorenzo Neal the best teammate he ever had and says he wants Marty Schottenheimer to present him for induction in the Hall of Fame:
Muslim American social media star Adam Saleh, who posted a video of himself being kicked off a Delta flight allegedly for speaking to his mother in Arabic on the phone has a history of making hoax videos staging anti-Muslim discrimination,
Muslim American social media star Adam Saleh, who posted a video of himself being kicked off a Delta flight allegedly for speaking to his mother in Arabic on the phone has a history of making hoax videos staging anti-Muslim discrimination, exposed a Youtuber.
Saleh's video of the incident went viral on Wednesday, along with his claim that he was kicked out “because I spoke Arabic to my mom on the phone.” Shortly afterwards, however, others pointed out that Saleh had a history of making videos about fake anti-Muslim racial profiling incidents and prank videos about planes in particular.
Delta on Wednesday also cleared the air regarding the allegations against its Flight 1. In an online statement on its official website, Delta said, “Upon landing the crew was debriefed and multiple passenger statements collected. Based on the information collected to date, it appears the customers who were removed sought to disrupt the cabin with provocative behaviour, including shouting. This type of conduct is not welcome on any Delta flight. While one, according to media reports, is a known prankster who was video recorded and encouraged by his travelling companion, what is paramount to Delta is the safety and comfort of our passengers and employees. It is clear these individuals sought to violate that priority.”
This is the guy who you guys think actually got kicked off a plane for speaking Arabic. #boycottdelta pic.twitter.com/ORqHxla1Kp — Ashley Rae (@Communism_Kills) December 21, 2016
Veteran journalist and former CNN host Soledad O'Brien also took to Twitter and revealed that she actually knew someone who was on the flight, who provided her with some background.
O'Brien's source told her that the Delta flight attendants were made aware that Saleh was a YouTube prankster.
A LOT still unclear. But apparently woman sitting near my friend tipped off flight attendants he was a youtube star known for pranks. — Soledad O'Brien (@soledadobrien) December 21, 2016
O'Brien also said that those aboard the flight were disputing the claim that he made a phone call to his mother, as Saleh claims in the video.
@soledadobrien Disputing that he made the call at all? Or that it was to his mother? — Alex Griswold (@HashtagGriswold) December 21, 2016
That YouTube celebrity kicked off the Delta flight was caught in a viral hoax with a different airline last week. https://t.co/Vc0A1LFtlv — Jimmy (@JimmyPrinceton) December 21, 2016
Real talk: Adam Saleh is obnoxious and I wouldn't be surprised if it is a prank BUT that doesn't discount this happening on the daily. — Sailor Mer(Kaye)ry (@gildedspine) December 21, 2016
If Adam Saleh was on a plane pranking just hours after a terrorist attack in Berlin, he deserved to be kicked off. — Rasha Al Aqeedi (@RashaAlAqeedi) December 21, 2016
This was the same Adam Saleh who was busted in 2014 over a hoax Islamophobia video in NYC.
Back in 2014, Adam Saleh had created a video called “RACIAL PROFILING EXPERIMENT!” that quickly gained two million views on YouTube. In it, Saleh purported to get in a fight with a friend in front of a police officer in Western-style clothing, and then reenacted the same fight dressed in traditional Muslim garb. Police supposedly only intervened when the men looked like Muslims.

On Sunday, the article Limbaugh/Hannity Parent Company Admits Hiring Actors to Call Radio Shows generated an explosive response on Twitter, in the blogosphere and subsequent reactions from Limbaugh, Hannity and Beck.
- Advertisement - Hannity attacked the messenger, Limbaugh attacked his bosses, Beck's blog attacked "currency manipulator" George Soros and the web was abuzz as the the public considered whether Limbaugh, Hannity or Beck might have used their parent company's dial-a-fraud radio call-in service.

- Advertisement - Limbaugh Pissed On his radio show Monday, (listen below) Rush Limbaugh responded to the online furor over his parent company acknowledging a secretive "custom caller" service. Rush questioned the judgment of the bosses at Premiere Radio Network when he got lumped in, accused of faking calls on his hyper-partisan political commentary show as it became clear his distributor hires and plants actors on radio programs. Until just recently, Premiere's promotional pitches did not specify that paid actors are not cast for calls on their nationally syndicated shows. Rush quickly claimed he had no idea his company was offering this service, pledging :"[i]f somebody had told me we were going to do this, I would put the kibosh on this".

Reached for comment, Limbaugh's producer shared that they had never used Premiere's "On Call" service and had no idea who had.
The article that set off the explosion of public criticism and media coverage, Limbaugh/Hannity Parent Company Admits Hiring Actors to Call Radio Shows , has led to speculation that the country's highest rated talk hosts knew the Clear Channel owned company was peddling a pay-to-lie service.
Limbaugh sharply rebuked the suggestion, decrying media coverage of the article and denying he had ever used actors on his show as he tried to dissociate himself from the service and any possibility that he staged calls. One could even witness his brain switch gears as he begins to ask his own call screener if he was in on it. This demonstrates how quickly Rush would attempt to insulate himself should it be uncovered someone else was assigning actors to call his show, perhaps in "common purpose".
Next, about 2:06 into the clip he says "over the years" people have "come to him with ideas" to "get in the act" but he "shot it down". Okay, is this shades of Governor Walker? Who in Rush's circle of prospective collaborators came to him with these ideas? We don't know. He didn't say, protecting their identities from the very listeners he was trying to assuage.
Hannity Indignant
Sean Hannity also denied planting calls in response to furiously tweeted reports announcing his company sells phony call-in services. But what did Hannity have to say about the many other allegations in the same article he cited ? Nothing. No point-by-point rebuttals.
some other Fox commentator running afoul of our domestic propaganda laws. At least now they have a denial on the record countering the fake call speculation, unlike Hannity's reaction to former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan's affirmation that Karl Rove and the Bush White House's "massive propaganda" operation would "call Sean" to act as the government's media mouthpiece in hyping bogus arguments for the Iraq war. In that case, Hannity's response was to shift the conversation away so no one noticed his non-denial, even as Bill O'Reilly demanded McClellan tell viewers it wasFox commentator running afoul of our domestic propaganda laws.
Whether it's frivolous prank call shows or political talk shows - the fact that even Hannity and Limbaugh have vociferously denounced the use of a paid caller operation puts all stations and hosts on notice. This may, however plunge a dagger into the heart of the Premiere On Call service. When the #1 and #2 broadcasters in the US disown a service their own company offers, wanting to put the "kibosh" on it, what does it say about stations who do use it? Anyone now found out to have used this service would be toast.
is allowed to hire the actors? Health shows? Consumer shows? Financial Shows? Relationship advice? Only wacky prank-call DJs? Since we don't know, we may well have to speculate. [Update: some of these questions now But questions still remain. Premiere's declaration their service "is not utilized by News/Talk programs or stations" begs the question, "who wrote the guidelines?" Who thenallowed to hire the actors? Health shows? Consumer shows? Financial Shows? Relationship advice? Only wacky prank-call DJs? Since we don't know, we may wellto speculate. [Update: some of these questions now may be answered
Beck Bonkers
The Blaze, author and Breitbart alum Mike Opelka also makes a blatant factual error saying "Tablet Magazine...neglected to exercise the most basic journalistic common courtesy -- asking the accused for a response. Instead of seeking real answers, they printed what they wanted to believe." Unlike the two top-rated radio mega-icons, Glenn Beck defends the pay-to-lie services , explaining real people are too dull and too inhibited. Through Beck's blogauthor and Breitbart alum Mike Opelka also makes a blatant factual error saying "Tablet Magazine...neglected to exercise the most basic journalistic common courtesy -- asking the accused for a response. Instead of seeking real answers, they printed what they wanted to believe."
Premiere On Call. Premiere, like many other content providers, facilitates casting--while character and script development, and how the talent's contribution is integrated into programs, are handled by the varied stations." That's no denial. In fact, Tablet's original article included a statement from Premiere spokesperson Karen Nelson who confirmed the existence of the service and shifted blame for any potential abuse onto her clients. "Premiere provides a wide variety of audio services for radio stations across the country, one of which is connecting local stations in major markets with great voice talent to supplement their programming needs," Nelson wrote in an email. "Voice actors know this service as. Premiere, like many other content providers, facilitates casting--while character and script development, and how the talent's contribution is integrated into programs, are handled by the varied stations." That's no denial.
Though Premiere may have been hiring actors since 2009 or even 2008, their casting service flew under the radar until last month when Tablet writer Liel Liebovitz met an actor who had auditioned for the job. "Once I learned about that, I reached out to other actors until I found enough sources who could corroborate the veracity of the story. I definitely talked to a number of actors who were paid to call in to radio shows. The people I talked to showed me communications from Premiere proving they were hired as freelance actors", Liebovitz said.
In further research, Liebovitz discovered that the Premiere On Call website advertised a wide diversity of voice types, ensuring calls would be varied and appear "authentic." But once discovered by a journalist, Premiere evidently had second thoughts about promoting the service online. Liebovitz told OpedNews.com, "Premiere took down the website as soon as I called to ask the question. I called on Tuesday, spoke to them on Wednesday, and it was taken down by Friday." The original promo copy can be seen as cached here
In part: Premiere responded Monday, recapping Limbaugh's on-air rant, but left out how upset Rush seemed that he wasn't notified and that Premiere On Call hadn't announced a policy to exclude "News/Talk" programs earlier. They certainly admitted the service did in fact exist, but changed the previous wording to be a little more ambiguous.
"Premiere is the syndication arm of the Rush Limbaugh program and Limbaugh used his show, in case there was any doubt, to let his audience know that none of his calls have ever been staged...Premiere On Call is not utilized by any of Premiere's nationally syndicated talent, including Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck...Premiere On Call is a recently launched audio service connecting local entertainment radio stations with great voice talent to supplement their programming needs. The service is not utilized by News/Talk programs or stations."
Liebovitz, an assistant professor of communications at NYU, told OpedNews,
"I'm not some naive who is unaware of the machinations of modern media. But this thing blew me out of the water. I was deeply troubled by what I discovered is going on. I really did not think, and for that matter, neither did Michael Harrison of Talkers Magazine (the talk radio trade journal) that this even existed." The Web Reacts
A deluge of tweets abounded in reaction to the OpedNews article, followed by heated debates on numerous blogs questioning whether it was appropriate to consider Limbaugh and Hannity as users of Premiere On Call. Bloggers on the right parroted Glenn Beck who dismissed TabletMag.com as "Soros-funded", asking "so what" if radio stations use pitch-perfect, clear-speaking actors instead of fumfering, inarticulate real people.
Far too many on the left inaccurately tweeted or blogged headlines like " Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity Caught Hiring Actors in Radio Fraud " in their haste to trash the hosts, while industry insiders asserted fraudulent calls were a longstanding open secret in radio, either using actors, show staff, interns or friends, describing rolodexes full of "ringers". One commenter claims to have worked as a plant on relationship advice shows, as well as wacky morning shows and comedy programs - but never any political programs. Another reader offered there were several such services available inside the industry bubble.
The legality of the practice was discussed, with some pointing to the precedent of the 1960 Communications Act amendment that followed rigged TV quiz show scandals. But others pointed to a 2003 Florida court decision that is said to have "legalized lying in news and media", with FOX TV teaming up with Monsanto to assert that there are no written rules against distorting "news" in the media as they suppressed safety concerns raised over introduction of synthetic hormones into livestock.
Many bloggers offered specific Sean Hannity call-ins they are wary may have been staged, such as a "small business owner" who called and started sobbing because Obama's taxing and regulations are "killing" her and her husband. This came in the days during the tax cut debate when Hannity was busily conflating the richest 1% of American earners with small business owners making $250K.
One listener pointed out how a "random" dittohead called Limbaugh to complain about actor Andy Griffith doing pro-Medicare ads. Then, suddenly, Rush started playing a prepared audio parody of Griffith making hilarious zingers about government healthcare programs. The celebrity impersonator threw in a race-baiting "good cracker!" comment, just for good measure at the end. Did Rush just happen to have the parody recording just laying around or was this call perhaps a set-up to the bit?
Another listener described a Limbaugh segment heard in the last week or two in which a caller claiming to be a schoolteacher described his NY town's fiscal troubles. On and on he went, allowed unusually excessive air time, detailing how the solution to the town's money woes was through natural gas exploration, which he assured was safe and environmentally friendly. He then described the town's "unreasonable" resistance to 'hydrofracking'. Rush was pretending to be only half interested, which the witness says he felt suggested the call and the caller was fake.
One Facebook user claimed Hannity and Limbaugh both showed a pattern of having summaries handy when right wing callers bring up stories, but are caught off guard when callers bring up left-leaning stories, hustling them off the air.
Liel Liebovitz, who broke this story, observed,
"I listen to a lot of radio, and since I learned this, I wonder, each time a caller calls in, whether this is a real person or an actor. Premier refused to answer to me and the Columbia Journalism Review. No-one is denying this. It is completely above ground. The question is who used this, how prevalent is this.
My piece is just step one. That's not even the important step. I would genuinely like to know how deep is this thing is. Is it a few radio shows using this once a month or every fourth caller?
My article ran, what, a month ago and really, no-one picked it up. I am incredibly grateful to OpedNews for getting such tremendous attention and you have done a lot to get my article which did not receive much attention and put it on the agenda and get in front of a lot more people."
We are gratified the public is now having this discussion. Whether it's Premiere's top-rated market leaders, like Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck, or progressive Premiere talk hosts like Randi Rhodes or Rev. Jesse Jackson, deception in radio betrays a sacred trust given public broadcasting licensees. Listeners may wonder, now knowing deceptive actors are out there, whether talk show callers are authentic or not whenever we listen. And it is Premiere's biggest name hosts -- Limbaugh, Beck and Hannity -- the people with the most leverage -- who have a duty to demand that Premiere discloses which shows use the planted actor service.
On Tuesday, Tiger Woods said he moved from California to Florida in 1996 to avoid the state's high taxes.
Woods was at Torrey Pines preparing for this weekend's PGA tournament near La Jolla, California when reporters asked if he would respond to Phil Mickelson's comments on Sunday that California's high tax rate would force Mickelson to either move out of the state or make “drastic changes” to his career. Woods said:
“I moved out of here back in '96 for that reason. I enjoy Florida but it was also…I understand what he was I think trying to say. I think he'll probably explain it better in a little bit more detail.”
Woods was raised in Cypress, California, which is in Orange County. He grew up playing and learning golf on a public golf course–Dad Miller Golf Course. He also attended Stanford University in Northern California and was an Orange County resident before making the move in 1996 to Florida. Florida has no state income tax.
California does have a state income tax. And after California voters passed proposition 30 last November, those making over $1 million now have to pay a 13.3% state income tax rate. Woods and Mickelson rank first and second, respectively, in career earnings on the golf course. Woods has earned over $100 million while Mickelson has made nearly $70 million. They have made more off the course in endorsements.

Australian Privacy Commissioner Karen Curtis has issued a muted statement in reaction to a proposal — dubbed “OzLog” online — by the Federal Attorney-General's Department which could see Australians' email and telephone records tracked by internet service providers.
“My office was consulted by the Attorney-General's Department on this proposal last year as part of initial consultations including with industry,” said Curtis. “At this stage, we understand the government is still considering the matter and we look forward to providing further comment as the proposal is developed.”
The Privacy Commissioner said in general, limiting the amount of information collected and the length of time it was retained was good privacy practice, however she added that under Australian legislation “it is important to balance other community interests such as public safety and national security with privacy considerations.”
“My office would also expect that any proposed legislation would have the appropriate privacy safeguards built-in,” she said.
Curtis' statement came in reaction to a number of questions sent by Delimiter to her office on the issue, which arose on Friday after the Attorney-General's Department confirmed it had been examining the European Directive on Data Retention to consider whether it would be beneficial for Australia to adopt a similar regime.
The directive requires telcos to record data such as the source, destination and timing of all emails and telephone calls – even including internet telephony.
ZDNet.com.au has also quoted ISP sources stating that the proposal could go as far as tracking Australians' web browsing history — a claim since denied by the office of Federal Attorney-General Robert McLelland.
The questions sent by Delimiter asked Curtis to give her opinion on whether the Attorney-General's proposal had the potential to contain privacy risks, but also general questions on how seriously the potential privacy risks were associated with the automatic storage of email information such as “to” and “from” addresses. Curtis did not directly address some of the questions.

Kevin Love is re-signing with the Cleveland Cavaliers, he announced Wednesday.
Love has agreed to a five-year, $110 million contract with the team, sources said.
Editor's Picks Love, Cavs look to finish what they started Kevin Love could have bolted for many reasons, but he saw in the postseason what he and the Cavaliers can accomplish.
Love among leading power forwards even with reduced role Love's statistics declined last season, but he was among the game's most effective power forwards 1 Related
"I'm going back to Cleveland," Love said in a first-person essay on The Players' Tribune website. "After Game 1 of the NBA Finals, that's when it really struck me. Sitting on the sidelines, I never wanted to play in a game more than that one. I had dreamed of playing in the NBA Finals, and I just wanted to help my guys win. I couldn't have been prouder of them as they poured their blood, sweat and tears onto the court.
"Yeah, of course I've heard the free-agency rumors. But at the end of the day, and after meeting with my teammates [it turns out pools are great meeting places] and with the front office, it was clear Cleveland was the place for me. We're all on the same page and we're all in. We have unfinished business, and now it's time to get back to work."
The Cavs made Love a priority on the first day of free agency. Love had maintained throughout the season that it was his intention to stay with the Cavs, and he backed it up by committing to a long-term contract, which could end up being the largest contract given out in the history of the Cavs franchise.
Love said LeBron James played "a big role" in his decision.
"I did want to sit down with LeBron and just lay everything out there on the table," Love said in a Sirius XM Mad Dog Radio interview with The Players' Tribune.
"We definitely laid it all out there, hung out, just had a leisurely conversation, and it was one of those moments where I thought we made a lot of good decisions and ended up at the same place. It really played a big part."
He also explained why he decided not to do a free-agency tour or meet with other teams during the process.
"I had already gone through the process in my head," he said in the radio interview. "I mean, I could have taken my time and potentially complicated things.
"I kind of wanted to push everything aside, hash everything out on my own. I have a couple, really select few people I have in my life that have my ear, and just wanted to follow my heart and do what I thought was best. And as I ran through that, I always felt Cleveland came out on top in every different scenario."
Love said his three priorities were happiness, winning and money, and Cleveland was where "I can really take a run at all three of those."
The Cavaliers are ready to go when it comes to winning next season, he said.
"I think naturally it's going to take a lot of work, and especially after seeing this season and for a lot of teams you have to have luck and not be bitten by the injury bug and fight the battle of attrition, but it's also the hardest thing in the world to get to the mountaintop," he said. "I think it's going to take a lot of big efforts in re-signing some guys and also getting on the same page, but I think always Year 1 is the toughest and we'll be able to continue to work for something special in Cleveland."

Home-alone girl, 12, foils burglar with a kick to the groin... then draws a picture of him for police
A hapless burglar came off second-best after he was caught red-handed by a home-alone 12-year-old girl - who promptly kicked him in the groin.
Brave Georgia Bulis-Gray went to investigate after she heard a door slam in her parents' kitchen and found herself confronting a hooded intruder.
The schoolgirl, who said she didn't want the smirking man to think she was helpless, kicked him hard, forcing him to flee in agony from the house in Bosham, West Sussex.
Georgia then called the police and even had the presence of mind to do a quick sketch of the man she had just seen.
An e-fit of the burglar drawn by 12-year-old Georgia
Georgia, a second year pupil at Chichester High School, West Sussex, said: 'He just smiled at me and I thought, "I do not want him thinking I am just a helpless little girl".
'It made me angry that he was doing something wrong and I did not want him to think that just because I am a little girl it did not matter what he was doing.
'He looked shocked that I did not scream or run away and faced up to him. I kicked him very hard and he groaned and then ran out of the side gate.
'I ran to the front door to see which direction he was running to. I did not want him going to anyone else's house.'
Georgia said of her 'photo-fit' sketch: 'It is not very good but I knew I had to draw something while his face was still fresh in my mind.'
Relieved mother Joanna, 48, admitted she was amazed at the bravery of her daughter in such a highly-pressurised situation.
She said: 'I am very proud of her she was incredibly brave to do what she did. He was a lot bigger than her.
'When she told me what she had done I was absolutely terrified. I dread to think what could have happened.
'I kept asking her if she was OK but she was so calm. I do not think I would have reacted like that; it is amazing how cool she was under pressure.
'She did not even want to tell me what had happened to start with she was calmly making supper and said, "Mum, something a bit odd has happened".
'On reflection, I worry that kicking him might have provoked him but maybe if she had not done it he might have locked her in her room or hurt her.'
The man, described as being white, of pale complexion and aged between 18 and 20 managed to escape the scene and a Sussex Police investigation is ongoing.
A spokesman for Sussex Police said: 'Georgia showed tremendous bravery to confront the intruder.'
Hogben never alluded to this application in his early reports, but it wasn't long before he was working towards it. Disenchanted with racism in South Africa, he returned to Britain shortly after his seminal experiments and brought a colony of Xenopus with him. His colleague Charles Bellerby worked out how to raise the frogs appropriately, showed that they would reliably lay eggs when exposed to the urine of pregnant women, and confirmed that when they're not mating, they don't lay eggs spontaneously. Another team from South Africa had been doing similar work, and as academics are wont to do, the two groups developed a bitter feud. It was never truly resolved, although Hogben could be said to have won, since the test that resulted from this work took his name.
The “Hogben test” was simple. Collect a woman's urine and inject it, fresh and untreated, under the skin of a female Xenopus. Then, wait. If the woman is pregnant, between five and 12 hours later, the frog will produce a cluster of millimeter-sized, black-and-white spheres. The results were reliable. One researcher reported that after injecting 150 frogs, he never got any false positives and only missed three actual pregnancies. And as one doctor wrote to Hogben's colleagues: “Thank you for your report on the pregnancy test on Mrs. X. You may be interested to know that of one GP of many years' standing, one specialist gynaecologist and one frog, only the frog was correct.'”
There's a long history of folk pregnancy tests: As my former colleague Cari Romm once wrote, “a long, long time before women peed on sticks, they peed on plenty of other things.” But the first reliable test was created in 1927 by German scientists Bernhard Zondek and Selmar Aschheim. Their “A-Z test” involved injecting human urine into immature female mice for a few days, dissecting the animals, and checking if their ovaries were bigger than normal.
A later version of this test used rabbits instead of mice. For some reason, people came to believe that the rabbits would die if the test was positive, and the phrase “the rabbit died” became a euphemism for pregnancy. In truth, the rabbits always died, because, like the mice, they had to be dissected to check the size of their ovaries. This meant that testing for pregnancy was laborious, expensive, and bloody work. In one Pregnancy Diagnosis Station, run by a friend of Hogben's, around 6,000 rabbits were sacrificed every year.
By comparison, the Xenopus test was faster, simpler for practitioners, and much easier on the animals. The frogs can live for up to 30 years in captivity, and since the tests didn't kill them, they could be reused. They were also easy to get. At first, doctors imported them from South Africa where, in the words of scientist Edward Elkan, “animal dealers seem to have no difficulty in catching as many as are required.” Later, many Xenopus colonies were established overseas.
What is your perfect childhood holiday memory? For New Yorkers, it might be seeing the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall, going to midnight Mass, large family gatherings or braving the crowds in Times Square for the New Year's ball drop.
Diana Zeyneb Alhindawi fondly remembers loud, drunk bears singing and dancing in her grandparents' living room.
Actually, they were men wearing full bearskins, but to a little child the effect was the same: thrilling, enchanting and more than a little bit scary. You see, Ms. Alhindawi, 36, spent the first eight years of her childhood in the Trotus Valley of Romania where the bears descended on homes every holiday season to chase away any bad spirits from the previous year. Given the few diversions available during the era of Communist rule, the dancing bears were easily the highlight of the year.
“It was a beautiful thing to wake up on a snowy December morning and hear the drumbeats and chanting echoing through the valley,” she said. “The bear troupes would come door to door and everyone would let them in. They're really rambunctious and they'd swing their heads around and cause a mess as the snow on them melted.”
Ms. Alhindawi lived with her grandparents in Moinesti while her Iraqi father and Romanian mother studied in Bucharest. She never forgot the raucous packs of bears playing music for tips, liquor and cubes of pig fat. Last year, she returned to her childhood home to spend time with her ailing Romanian grandmother — and to see the dancing bears again.

The tradition originated among the Roma who migrated from India centuries ago. Ms. Alhindawi's grandmother has childhood memories of Roma who went door to door with bear cubs who walked on the backs of villagers to alleviate back pain. When the bears aged, their owners had them dance in exchange for tips.
It's not clear when the bears were replaced by people wearing skins or when ethnic Romanians adapted the ritual, Ms. Alhindawi said. But traditional Roma costumes are still worn during the holiday celebrations, and the songs reflect their influence.
Gaining access to photograph the bears was relatively simple because Ms. Alhindawi's family was well known in the small town — they were the ones who made it to America. Her mother called childhood friends, and soon Ms. Alhindawi was spending a few frigid days with Dumitru Toloaca and his troupe of men, women and children clad in bearskins. She also spent some time with similar groups in nearby villages.
She photographed them performing and competing in the village square, where they were judged on the quality of their skins, costumes, dancing and overall presentation. She also followed them as they wandered at night visiting restaurants and a few homes to which they were invited.
“You can't see much because it's so dark,” Ms. Alhindawi said. “You can hear the crunch of the bear-claw boots on the snow and then, all of a sudden, the drumbeats break out and the sound of the flutes echoes through the alleyways. Then they pass under a streetlamp, and you see bears walking through a snowstorm!”

Some things had changed over the years. Stores have more food and goods since the fall of Communism, she said, but few people can afford much. Rural areas like Moinesti have grown poorer while the cities have become wealthier, and most people have gone to Bucharest or nearby countries to work, leaving the village with mostly older people and children.
These changes have affected the bear traditions, too. Fewer people have the money to welcome, feed and tip the bears, while younger people, distracted by video games, television and the Internet, are less interested in the folk traditions. There are fewer bear troupes, and they perform for just a handful of days.
Ms. Alhindawi left Romania when she was 8, became a refugee in Yugoslavia and was resettled in Canada. When she was 16 her father, a doctor, and her mother, a mechanical engineer, moved the family, including her younger brother Austin, to Long Island. After studying neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University, Ms. Alhindawi worked in research labs and became an international aid and human rights worker in East Timor, Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. A little over two years ago she became a full-time photojournalist working in many of the same locations. Documenting the bears was a welcome respite from photographing in conflict zones.
“I'm so happy to have done this,” she said. “There were so many times I wanted to put my camera down, put on a bearskin and join them. It's really magical, like going into a fairy tale.”

Tom Cleverley is in line to make his Manchester United comeback in next month's Premier League encounter with Liverpool on February 11.The midfielder was one of the major influences behind United's flying start to the season, which earned him England call-ups for the postponed August friendly against Holland and the Euro 2012 qualifiers with Bulgaria and Wales.Yet, almost immediately, injury intervened.First the 22-year-old suffered a foot problem during the September win at Bolton, then, on his Premier League reappearance at Everton, Cleverley sustained a blow to his ankle and has been sidelined ever since.However, Ferguson confirmed he is back on the comeback trail and should be able to play a part in football training within 10 days.And, if all goes to plan, Cleverley could be fit for match action within a week, which would put him on target to face Liverpool."I am hopeful in 10 days' time he will be playing football on the training side of it anyway. That is the plan unless there is any recurrence of the injury," Ferguson said."Then we can kick on."When he plays properly depends on how he does in the training."His fitness levels should be fine, so he could cope right away. "If he can, you are talking about a week."And that, coming in the middle of a crucial period when United faces a succession of top six contenders, could provide the Red Devils with a significant lift."It would be a great boost to us," said Ferguson."The way that Tom started the season was absolutely phenomenal."I have not seen a young player have that impact at our club for a long time."He has been a loss because he has something different from everyone else."
Is a bank chief worth 1,000 nurses? That provocative question arose earlier this year when it was announced that Bob Diamond, the chief executive of Barclays Bank, received a total income of around £25 million ($40m). That's enough to pay for an extra 1,019 nurses, 859 social workers or 2,165 care workers, according to figures produced by a leading trade union. The bumper pay packet came despite the bank's pre-tax profits falling 3% to £5.9 billion ($9.5bn).
Since the start of the ongoing financial crisis five years ago, politicians have been keen to bash bankers, rhetorically at least. President Barack Obama, for example, called excessive bonuses "obscene". While opponents of giant rewards to bankers and business executives tend to argue they are unfair on ethical grounds, those in favour usually shift the debate away from morality and towards more pragmatic ground, arguing they are necessary to attract, retain and incentivise talented staff.
While the behavioural sciences are of limited help on the ethics involved, the claim that multi-million pound pay packages boost performance is a separate and testable assertion. Performance-related pay has become so deeply ingrained that few questions it. Most of us assume that offering people bigger financial rewards means people try harder. However a growing body of research in the fields of psychology and economics, and more recently neuroscience, paints a more complex picture of the relationship between money, motivation and performance.
Pioneering work in the field was carried out in the early 1970s by Edward Deci, a psychologist at Rochester University in New York. He found that students offered cash prizes to solve puzzles were less likely to continue working on them after payments had been made, compared to students who were offered no money. Deci's work helped clarify the relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation - doing things because you like doing them in their own right or doing them because you want a reward that has been offered.
“People have three psychological needs – to feel autonomous, to feel competent and to feel related to others,” he says. Payment, according to Deci's research, does not fulfill these needs. Over-emphasis on financial reward undermines autonomy and therefore intrinsic motivation, he says. “This [negative effect of money on motivation] matters hugely. You need high quality performance from bankers. You need thinkers, problem solvers, people who can be creative and using money to motivate them will not get you that.”
Perhaps more surprisingly some economists also question how good money is as a motivator. Dan Ariely, of Duke University, North Carolina, in the US, provides a compelling example. “If I ask you to help me change a tire on my car you might be willing to help, but if I offer you a dollar for this you don't say to yourself ‘gee I get to help Dan and I get a dollar'. In contrast you say: ‘It's a dollar, I don't work for a dollar' and you're less interested in doing this.” In other words the introduction of financial incentives into a relationship by one party can undermine another's motivation to perform a task.
But maybe the small sums involved in Ariely's example and Deci's experiments undermine their application to real-world international business and finance. To address this, Ariely and colleagues, recruited villagers in India to play games testing memory, creativity and motor skills, offering three different groups four, 40 or 400 rupees per game for scoring highly. The maximum reward was equivalent to the amount spent by the average person living in rural India in five months. They found that those offered the highest incentives performed worst, earning an average of 20% of the maximum possible, compared to around 36% for those in the low and medium reward groups. “Our results challenge the assumption that an increase in motivation would necessarily lead to improvements in performance,” says Ariely.
It also illustrates the complexity of teasing apart motivation. He believes the giant potential rewards on offer to some of his Indian subjects undermined their ability to perform by making them overly focused or mentally aroused. This idea that there is an optimal level of mental arousal that stimulates good performance, which when either lowered or raised undermines our abilities, was first proposed by US psychologists a century ago.
This concept of failure to perform under pressure, or "choking", is well known in sport. A famous example saw French golfer Jean Van de Velde needing to sink the ball in six shots on the last hole of the final round of the 1999 British Open to win. Having done so in just three shots in the two previous rounds, he crumbled under pressure and took seven shots, before losing the resulting play off.
Jump for cash
A key problem that has faced those in this field in the past has been the difficulty of measuring motivation using psychological tests and questionnaires. But the increasing use of brain imaging technologies in neuroscience has provided a new and more direct method to study thoughts and feelings. These techniques are now being adopted to tease apart the different aspects of motivation.
Dean Mobbs, of the University of Cambridge, UK, and colleagues, for example, have used brain scanning to show how choking is manifested in the brain. In his study participants played a computer game in which they had to race against the clock to catch a prey in a simple, two-dimensional maze, while their brains were scanned by an MRI machine. They were told they would win either 50p or £5 if they succeeded within the time limit.
The results, published in the journal Psychological Sciences in 2009, showed performance was worse when the larger bonus was on offer and that this was associated with increased activity in brain regions involved in motivation. Mobbs suggests that excessive activity in areas of the brain that deal with motivation can come to dominate our decision-making abilities, leading us to make more mistakes, or "choke on the money".
In his experiments in India, Ariely expected, based on previous work, that large rewards would undermine performance in tests of motor skills and creativity but not those involving memory. In fact they led to worse results in all three. He believes this was down to the huge size of the payments causing his participants to choke. So to try to work out what types of tasks could be motivated by money he set up a second experiment in which he offered two groups of American students rewards of $15 to $30, or $150 to $300, if they did well in tasks involving maths or repetitive key-pressing. In the key-pressing task participants earned an average of 78% of maximum potential earnings when offered the larger incentives versus 40% for those receiving the smaller sums. In contrast, in the maths tests, the larger payments undermined performance, with recipients earning only 43% of their maximum potential earnings, compared to 63% when offered lower financial rewards.
“If I gave you a bigger bonus to jump you would jump more times," says Ariely. "You have very good control over your legs and if I give you more money you will transmit more power to them and therefore you will be more successful. We don't have the same control over memory, creativity and concentration. You can't will yourself into a higher state of concentration and creativity. It's actually counterproductive and hinders performance strongly.” Anyone that has tried to force themselves to concentrate can probably relate to those findings. But there are also more subtle effects of motivation that can be teased apart using these new techniques.
Brain test
Psychologist Kou Murayama, at University of California, Los Angeles, originally studied motivation in relation to learning and education. During a conversation with neuroscientist Kenji Matsumoto, of Tamagawa University in Tokyo, he realised their fields viewed motivation very differently. “I was struck by the fact that in neuroscience motivation is assumed to be a single, unitary concept and just a function of external reward,” says Murayama.
He and Matsumoto set up a study in which they asked volunteers to play a simple game involving pressing a button every time a stopwatch on a computer screen reached five seconds. The goal was to do so within one-twentieth of a second. Participants in one group received a small financial reward each time they achieved this while those in another did not. The tests were carried out in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. Those offered financial rewards experienced higher levels of activation of parts of the brain associated with motivation. “Extrinsic incentives are actually useful to temporarily enhance motivation,” says Murayama.
The participants then had a short break outside the scanner in which they could choose to either read some unrelated leaflets or continue playing the game. They were unaware that the choice they made was being monitored. Then they played the stopwatch game again, and this time both groups received a fixed sum of money for taking part, with no performance-related payments. Intriguingly, in those who received cash prizes the first time around, less activity was observed in the brain areas associated with motivation the second time they played the game. Moreover those that had the greatest decrease in activity were the least likely to have voluntarily practiced the game during their break outside the MRI machine.
Murayama and Matsumoto's findings, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2010, suggest that money can motivate people to work while simultaneously reducing their intrinsic motivation. “We do not think we should get rid of all the extrinsic rewards from educational and work settings," says Murayama. "Rather, we may need a more balanced view between extrinsic, short-lived monetary rewards and intrinsic motivation. This would lead to another interesting possibility that extrinsic motivation may be transformed to intrinsic motivation under certain circumstances.”
Psychologists, economists and neuroscientists are slowly but surely painting an ever more detailed picture of the complex relationships between our internal drives and external incentives such as money. It is so far an incomplete picture, they acknowledge. “Neuroeconomics has in principle the possibility to tell us a lot, but we are not there yet,” says Ariely. Murayama stresses the need to test ideas outside of the brain scanner in situations that more closely mimic our real life work and bonus cultures. “It is true that it [the detrimental effect of money on motivation] exists in experimental settings, but we need to show that it does indeed have great impact in practice.” Murayama and colleagues are now starting to use brain scanning to investigate how factors other than money, such as our desire to beat our own targets or to do better than others, might also affect brain networks associated with motivation and ultimately performance.
None of these researchers are proposing that Bob Diamond and the rest of us would perform better without financial rewards. Money can and does motivate people to work, yet large performance-related bonuses can reduce our personal interest in tasks and potentially undermine performance. While some progressive employers have started to take note of some of these insights being generated by the behavioural sciences, a larger number could probably benefit from a deeper understanding of employee motivation in order to re-design working patterns and payment schemes in ways that could improve both job satisfaction and productivity.
“I am not suggesting that they [people] should not be well paid for doing their work," says Deci. "I am saying we need to get out of the place of thinking that the way to motivate is to give them incentives for specific tasks. We need to think about how to make the workplace one in which people will get their needs satisfied and in which they will perform well.”
On Aug. 31, Army Spc. Kevin Shumaker, 24, died of rabies after being bitten by a stray dog in Afghanistan. Shumaker was the first U.S. soldier to die of rabies since the Vietnam War. In response, the Army launched a public education offensive, hanging up posters like the one above that warn of the deadly viruses lurking within even the cuddliest of creatures. You see, dogs aren't the only rabies carriers. As the U.S. Army Public Health Command notes, "EVEN KITTENS CAN BE DEADLY!" In other words, Fluffy here ain't your average lolcat. Image: Army Public Health Command
5.6 Bites Per Day According to a study released by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center in September, 20,522 service members sustained animal bites between January 2001 and December 2010. That's more than 5.6 bites per day, if you're keeping score at home. The vast majority of the troops were bitten on U.S. soil, where rabies is rare. (So rare, in fact, that Spc. Shumaker is the only U.S. citizen to die of the disease this year.) But, of the 643 servicemen and women who were a bit on the battlefield, only 117 received rabies vaccines and only 25 received the treatment that would be necessary for recovery had they actually contracted the disease. Army medical officials are currently retracing their steps to make sure there aren't any soldiers other than Spc. Shumaker who were bitten by rabid animals. Image: Army Public Health Command
Covert Assassin Pups Don't be fooled by the floppy ears, soft bellies, and tiny paws — these puppies are harbingers of death. They aim to destroy, one nip at a time. And there's no way you can tell because they're masters of disguise: "Not all animals with rabies look sick or act strange," the ad tells us. So keep away from anything that wants to play fetch or lick your face because it will probably kill you. Image: Army Public Health Command
Mascots, No More The Uniform Code of Military Justice prohibits soldiers from “adopting as pets or mascots, caring for, or feeding any type of domestic or wild animal.” As the Armed Forces Health Surveillance System study points out, "even minor animal bite injuries can have serious consequences — particularly bites inflicted by wild animals (including bats, foxes, skunks, and raccoons), feral cats and dogs, and pets with unknown rabies vaccination statuses." The Army Public Health Command didn't provide any information about how these posters were made, but it sure looks like this soldier is in direct violation of the very rule he is advertising. It hardly seems fair that he gets to hold a puppy while everyone else has to release their pet bats and rats into the wild. Image: Army Public Health Command
Filthy Bloodsucking Mosquitoes Viet Cong soldiers weren't the only shadows lurking in the jungle during the Vietnam War. Soldiers contended with tigers, snakes, leeches, spiders, and just about every other bloodthirsty member of the animal kingdom. Apparently the mosquitoes were particularly vicious, prompting the army to publish a medical bulletin that featured this helpful cartoon. Image: Stimson Library, U.S. Army Academy of Health Sciences
Hungry Crocs Saltwater crocodiles can weigh up to 2,000 pounds and grow to up to 20 feet long. And they're opportunistic hunters. On Feb. 19, 1945, the Japanese Army found this out the hard way. Allied troops landed on Ramree Island, located off the coast of Burma, and attacked the Japanese stronghold. The Japanese were backed into a marshy, swampy forest full of saltwater crocodiles, mosquitoes, and scorpions. The Allied troops supposedly begged the Japanese soldiers to surrender, but stationed themselves around the water to prevent them from escaping. Bruce Wright, a naturalist who was fighting for the British, said this of what happened next: “That night was the most horrible that any member of the M.L. [motor launch] crews ever experienced. The scattered rifle shots in the pitch black swamp punctured by the screams of wounded men crushed in the jaws of huge reptiles, and the blurred worrying sound of spinning crocodiles made a cacophony of hell that has rarely been duplicated on earth. At dawn the vultures arrived to clean up what the crocodiles had left … Of about 1,000 Japanese soldiers that entered the swamps of Ramree, only about 20 were found alive.” These numbers are disputed — some reports say 400 men entered the swamp, others say up to 1,000 — but regardless, the Guinness Book of World Records has called the event “the greatest disaster suffered from animals” of all time.

Giant Camel Spiders These are solifugae — the dreaded camel spiders of Iraq. According to legend, they grow to more than a foot long, scamper at a rate of 25 miles per hour, and hollow out the contents of a camel's stomach to lay their eggs. When they don't get their fill of camel, they prey on humans and inject their venomous saliva into our glands. Turns out none of this is true. Actually, the spiders typically have a leg span of five or six inches (though they really can grow up to 12 inches long), are only capable of speeds of maybe 10 mph, and are not poisonous. I still wouldn't want to wake up with one of these guys in my sleeping bag like this soldier did in Baghdad. Image: Flickr/David~O
Watch: Heroic man on motorcycle saves the life of a man about to jump
A man in Russia is hitchhiking from Vladimir (near Moscow) to the Kursk region to attend his mother's funeral when he is overcome with grief. He decides to jump off an overpass on the Minsk highway, and as he stands over the passing cars below him, a man on a motorcycle spots him. The driver has to turn around and drive against traffic to get back under the suicidal man. He shouts over the traffic in Russian, from the highway to the overpass, and talks the man into stepping away from the ledge. He then rides up to the overpass to talk to the man face to face. But that isn't the end of it. Although on YouTube the description of what happened, even after what you see in the video, is written in Russian, I put it through Google's translator. It's a bit rough but clear enough:
"Suicide attempt on the viaduct of the Minsk highway"
"I saw him from the corner of my eye, but it was clear that a person was already ready to take a step. Forgive me, I knew that I was breaking the rules, and I did it as carefully as possible, since I understood that there was no time for another solution."
"He could jump just under the car. So I decided to stop the flow of cars. After the end of this video, he tried to escape from us, we ran after him. He lied that he was going to the Smolensk region.
Thank you not indifferent motorists, who also saw and stopped, they also called for help."
"The story is simple. According to the guy, he hitch-hiked from Vladimir to the Kursk region for the funeral of his mother and, as you can understand, morally broke."
"We waited for everyone, the police, the police and the ambulance arrived quickly. From the moment we drove up to Alexei, it took no more than 10 minutes. All this time we talked to him on abstract topics and caught him twice, as he tried to escape. As a result, everyone calmly agreed that he would sit in the Inspectors' car and go with them."

Kevin Durant isn't mincing his words these days.
A day after expressing his displeasure with the amount of power that media members have in determining postseason awards, the Oklahoma City Thunder star once again took aim at the media on Saturday, this time prompted by questions surrounding the future of head coach Scott Brooks and his job security.
of NewsOK.com:
"You guys really don't know (expletive)," Durant told reporters in his final interview session before Sunday's All-Star Game. Durant was later asked what stories he would like the media to focus on more. "To be honest, man, I'm only here talking to y'all because I have to," Durant said. "So I really don't care. Y'all not my friends. You're going to write what you want to write. You're going to love us one day and hate us the next. That's a part of it. So I just learn how to deal with y'all."
Durant also commented on letting more of his personality shine through compared to his early years in the league:
I'm 26 years old so I'm in my mid-20s, almost to 30. My first few years in the league I was just finding myself. I think most of the time I reacted based off of what everybody else wanted and how they viewed me as a person. And I'm just learning to be myself and not worry about what anybody says. I'm going to make mistakes. I just want to show kids out here that athletes, entertainers, whoever, so-called celebrities, we aren't robots. We go through emotions. We go through feelings. And I'm just trying to express mine and trying to help people along the way. But I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I'm just this guy that got programmed to say the right stuff all the time and politically correct answers. I'm done with that. I'm just trying to be me and continue to grow as a man.
Bomani Jones of ESPN speculated on what the reaction to Durant's statements might be:
While Durant's honesty is refreshing and preferable to when players toe the proverbial company line and answer questions like media-trained robots, it's also fair to question whether a difficult, injury-plagued season has partially inspired his newfound edginess. The Thunder are back in playoff contention, but it's been an uphill climb.
Durant, the defending MVP, is still averaging 25.9 points, 6.6 rebounds and 4.0 assists per game.
It's nothing new for athletes to have a prickly relationship with the media, though it seems to have almost come into vogue in the past year, namely after Marshawn Lynch of the Seattle Seahawks spent much of this NFL season finding creative ways to avoid answering any questions.
Durant, to his credit, has taken a more direct route and seems comfortable transitioning from his former soft-spoken, nice-guy image to a more outspoken, intense persona.
Let's be real. The majority of transhumanists, scientists, astronomers, computer specialists, etc. became interested in their fields of study through their interest in science-fiction. We know the story of how cellphones were designed with Star Trek‘s communicators in mind, as were tablet computers, ebooks, and other new technologies. That has all been well-documented and I'm relatively certain that it is not news to most of us. Star Trek has been very influential in my life, guiding my thought processes in many areas, like physics, astronomy, quantum mechanics - even politics and economics. Part 2 of the Casual Transhuman.
I think that, more so than Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica and Babylon 5, the galaxy as envisioned by Gene Roddenberry has inspired people from all walks of life - scientist and layperson, politician and religious leader, male and female - to work toward creating a better future. The idea of this liberal, technologically-advanced, culturally-diverse near-utopia that has no further need for hard labor, resource mining, or even money has given people something to strive toward.
Yet there is a dark side to Star Trek.
The most feared villains of the 24th Century are a monstrous group of cybernetically enhanced organisms connected to each other through a collective hive-like consciousness. They have lost all semblance of individuality. They are the Borg, and their only desire is to “assimilate” every free being they see into the Collective, “adding their biological and technological distinctiveness to our own.” The Borg are cold, unfeeling drones, who speak as one in a monotonous cacophany. Their limbs are replaced with tools, specially designed for the work that that drone is expected to perform. Most have at least one eye replaced with an implant which allows them to see beyond the visible spectrum, and which also has a nifty heads-up display. When a Borg is killed another appears next to it, removes vital pieces of technology, then walks away. The dead drone then disappears. Beamed? Disintegrated? Who knows? But the other drones don't seem to care, so neither do we. What people find most disturbing about the Borg is their loss of individuality. They are the zombies of Star Trek, and are popular for the same reasons.
Pretty terrifying, isn't it?
Every time some new piece of technology is invented - every new social network that goes online - every breakthrough in human-computer interface is cause for alarm in many people who feel that we are becoming ever more like the Borg Collective. As is customary for my articles, a quick Google Search will come up with some insight into the thoughts of the non-transhumanists.
As a rule, when some new gadget is introduced, like say the Oakley's HUD glasses - a competitor to the Google Glasses, one of the first reader comments will be the familiar “Resistance is Futile.” refrain. It doesn't even have to make sense to the article. There just has to be a report on a major (or not-so-major) news site about technology, and somewhere beneath it, you will see those words.
But is it such a bad thing for humanity to want to become a collective? Isn't one of the main selling points of the internet, social media, etc. the fact that we are all now closer than ever? What I write on my Twitter account can be read by hundreds or even thousands of people instantly. They know what I am thinking, and I can see what is on the mind of all the people I follow. Facebook allows me to share videos, photos, music, status updates and more (although I rarely use Facebook anymore, but I plan on returning to it). Foursquare, Google+, LinkdIn, Skype, and all the other apps and social media are being used to keep us constantly “plugged in” to our peers, our favorite celebrities, causes, politicians, businesses and anyone or anything else we want. Anything I want or need to know can be accessed instantaneously through my various devices. I have been keeping up on the reasearch into Google Glasses, Augmented Reality, implanted microchips, prosthetic limbs, brain uploading and more and I have to say “bring it on!” I grew up in the 1980s and 1990s and have lived on both sides of the technology boom. As a child I listened to vinyl records and now I have hours of music loaded onto my Android phone. I used to go to the corner Blockbuster once a week to rent VHS tapes and now I can instantly Netflix anything I want on my laptop, phone or TV. As I write these articles, or my upcoming novel, if I need specific information about a topic, it is there for me, either online or through a friend or follower, and I find that to be incredibly exciting.
In other words, I grew up “free” and have been “assimilated” into the collective consciousness of humanity, which is increasingly digital. 24 hour news has given rise to instant political commentary, so I know where each side stands on a given situation. People from all walks of life give input on message boards, Twitter and Facebook. CNN often shows viewer Tweets in the scroll at the bottom of the screen. Yet I do not feel like I have lost my individuality, in a Borg-like stupor. I feel much more informed than I would be if I were disconnected. I feel like I am a part of a greater whole. And I feel like I can be heard. I am not a voiceless drone. I am not one of the millions speaking in unison. The technology that connects me to everyone else does not rule me. I rule the technology and I use it to better myself. After all, isn't that what Transhumanism is all about?
So how do we spread the word? How do we make breakthrough technology “sexier” to the general public? It seems that as long as there is some distance between the person and the product, people aren't as nervous. Cell phones, tablet computers, iPods and the like are ubiquitous. However, as soon as someone brings up microchip implants, HUD glasses or thought-controlled interfaces - wearable technoloogy - people are upset about the potential consequences. In other words, how do we let people know that can we make “cyborgs” without making “The Borg?”
This one will all come down to advertising, I think. Take a look at this video...
And this one…
These videos show people who are becoming more and more integrated with their technology. The woman in the first video has received an implant that allows her to hear for the first time. Did she immediately lose all her humanity? No. She is now able to participate more in society. To hear music, laughter, and all sorts of other things. Her use of this technology gave her one of the most sincere and wonderful emotional reactions I've ever watched. Cyborg? Yes. Borg? Not even remotely. The second video shows how currently developing technologies are going to integrate into the daily lives of people in the not-too-distant future. Do these people seem inhuman? Do they walk around like mindless zombies? No. In fact, they appear to have more time for interpersonal communication and healthy relationships. Of course, this video was created to make everyone appear happy, wealthy and well-adjusted. The truth will probably be a little less pleasant, but the idea remains the same, and it's a good one. This video shows us that the future can be more like Star Trek, and that that future is not very far off.
A constant influx of these types of images - of happy people and their serene lives made possible through technology - might help to soften some of the Luddite reaction. Although, the comments sections beneath both of those videos on YouTube do feature debates and some very frightened people. We will never make everyone happy about the merger of man and machine, but with continued positive press and cheaper and more powerful devices, we will soon become linked together to spread our ideas, our beliefs, our lives with each other on a global scale, and we will be able to see, hear and do things that no humans in history have ever done. We are a collective species already, living in our big cities and longing to be part of groups with similar interests. We just need to take the next step - together.
The translation of Sena's route is now complete! Credit to Solo Spieler and Secchan for their contributions and Fiddle for finishing it off.
But today we have news even bigger than Sena's mammaries. With this route complete, translation is now at 100%! Those of you who have been watching us intently have surely noticed some extended periods of little to no translation progress, and some of you have politely demanded an explanation for said periods, to which we replied that we had been checking/proofreading other routes in that time. Well, now you may assume that this information was accurate, because we've made so much progress in that regard that we will be able to release the full patch quite soon after the 100% translation that took place today: On December 24th!
Again, that's December 24th, 2015, two days from now, Christmas Eve, the fourth anniversary of Yuzusoft's original release of Noble☆Works.
From Keisuke and Fiddle: Thank you all for your support and patience.
Image caption More than 300 people have so far died in the current yellow fever outbreak in Angola
In the green and shaded gardens of the Americo Boavida Hospital in Angola's capital, Luanda, women in colourful printed dresses wait patiently for visiting hours to begin.
It is one of the biggest hospitals in the city, serving almost two million people.
Malaria is the most common killer here, but since December last year they have had to counter another, potentially more dangerous, mosquito-borne virus: Yellow fever.
In its 16 June report, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that 345 people are reported to have died from yellow fever in the last seven months among more than 3,000 cases in Angola.
Not since 1971 has there been such a serious outbreak, and the reasons why it has happened now are complex and many.
Image caption Not everyone who has the yellow fever virus experiences symptoms
Dr Fortunato Silva, the clinical director at Americo Boavida, says that this outbreak is more worrying not only in relation to the number of cases, but also the number of deaths.
He thinks some of the reasons for this may include the virus becoming more virulent, immunity levels amongst the population dropping and most critically, people not vaccinating as they should.
"Ninety patients have been hospitalised with fever, jaundice and haemorrhaging, since 23 February," Dr Silva said.
"There have been 33 deaths, which is a very high mortality rate. All of them had tested negative for malaria."
Angola's health system is well regarded, and there are established countrywide vaccination and awareness programmes.
Since 1989, babies have been vaccinated against yellow fever at the age of nine months, and children cannot attend school unless they have a valid yellow fever certificate.
Despite this, Dr Silva says, something is not working, and there are questions that need to be answered in terms of public health strategies.
Image caption About 15% of people who have yellow fever experience severe symptoms
Dr Francisco Songane, the representative in Angola for the UN children's fund, Unicef, describes what is happening as "a major crisis".
He says critical time was lost between samples being taken, tests being run, and results finally arriving three weeks later.
By the time confirmation of yellow fever came, it had spread from the densely populated area of K30, part of the capital's Viana district, and then across the entire city.
The spread of yellow fever
Angola - 345 reported deaths, 3,137 suspected cases
Democratic Republic of the Congo - 71 reported deaths, 1,044 suspected cases (not all linked to Angola)
Kenya - two suspected cases (travellers returning from Angola)
China - 11 suspected cases (travellers returning from Angola)

Dr Songane says that though measures were immediately put in place, in a city such as Luanda, where there are "huge neighbourhoods... a sea of so many houses, so populated, the virus spread very quickly".
And to compound the already serious outbreak, there was a global shortage of the vaccine to contend with. And vaccines must be administered within 10 days of the outbreak being identified.
"The timeline was not being met," he says. "And the shortage of vaccine meant that by then it had spread beyond Luanda."
The shortage now means that the WHO now recommends cutting the standard dose of yellow fever vaccine by 80%. The smaller dose would provide immunity for at least 12 months, it says.
Further adding to the crisis was the widespread use of fake yellow fever certificates, because, as Dr Songane explains "there were also misconceptions that the vaccine will kill you, that you will get a disease.
"There is a need to counter this and get the message to the people that you can do good for yourself, your community, your neighbourhoods.
"Fake certificates will not protect you. That's the message."
Nearly all of Luanda's population has now been vaccinated, and the ministry of health is in a race against time to get enough of the vaccine manufactured for the rest of the country.
What is yellow fever?
Caused by a virus that is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes
Difficult to diagnose and often confused with other diseases or fevers
Presence of yellow fever antibodies can be detected by blood tests
Most people recover after the first phase of infection that usually involves fever, muscle and back pain, headache, shivers, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting
About 15% of people face a second, more serious phase involving high fever, jaundice, bleeding and deteriorating kidney function
Half of those who enter the "toxic" phase usually die within 10 to 14 days The rest recover
Source: WHO
Angola strictly enforces international regulations on travellers coming in and out of the country, and Dr Songane says that whilst hard lessons have been learned, every country must now enforce these regulations.
Vaccines take six months to produce and if there is another serious outbreak, global supplies will not be able to keep up with the demand.
But it is too late to prevent its spread beyond Angola's borders.
Neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo has declared a localised yellow fever epidemic in three provinces, including the capital Kinshasa. Cases related to the outbreak in Angola have also surfaced in Kenya and China.
The mosquito that carries the virus, aedes aegypti, is found in most of the country, but it is prevalent in Luanda, made worse now by uncollected refuse.
Angola is one of Africa's largest oil producers, and nearly 70% of the government's income derives from oil.
In the boom years the country invested heavily in infrastructure projects and social welfare, but now with the collapse in the price of oil, basic services like garbage collection have stopped.
Rotting rubbish can be see piling high along with sewage running through crowded neighbourhood streets.
Dr Songane argues that it is urgent that a way is found to solve the issue of the rubbish piling up.
Image caption Rubbish and sewage in the streets in some parts of Luanda have made containing the virus harder
"People cannot continue to live in these conditions," he says.
"This has become a rich and beautiful place for this mosquito to bite, and it's made worse because it bites during the day. [The rubbish] is in the streets and people are being exposed every day."
Only some of those who carry the yellow fever virus get the symptoms, but the rest, who may be unaware that they are carriers, can be bitten by the mosquito and therefore help spread the virus.
Dr Songane says the outbreak is not yet under control. He is aware that much needs to be done, but there is no sense of panic.
It is only when transmissions stop, he says, "that we can breathe. It's not over until it's over".
At 10 a.m. this morning, Current Events Aggregate (or Agg. for short) broke the news of an explosion in Singapore.
It was the first in a series of updates on the increasingly dire situation in Singapore. The account seemed to have the story exclusively.
Except it wasn't real news. Nothing out of the ordinary was, or is, happening in Singapore . No quarantine zone has been established; the actions of military drones were made up. The state has not declared Martial Law.
Current Events Agg. had never tweeted any real news before, unless that news was related to Call of Duty. A more perceptive Twitter user than I likely noticed immediately that this Singapore explosion story was coming from the Call of Duty series' handle; it had changed its branding, name and bio.
This was a bad idea.
The Twitter platform is at its most productive when deployed as a crowd-sourced news-gathering and -generating service. It's been used in this manner to break stories as they develop around the world and communicate them to an international audience.
Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, which will undoubtedly sell millions without the use of this type of dramatic, poorly packaged stunt, the developer re-appropriated one of social media's most beneficial functions in order to serve its needs. Many on Twitter were horrified when they realized the tweets were part of a publicity stunt. In order to get people talking about the upcoming, which will undoubtedly sell millions without the use of this type of dramatic, poorly packaged stunt, the developer re-appropriated one of social media's most beneficial functions in order to serve its needs. Many on Twitter were horrified when they realized the tweets were part of a publicity stunt.
Who was the audience here? Breaking news is broadly relevant, and the lack of new or interesting Call of Duty-related content suggests this was a move to attract a wider audience. The new branding and tweets required a second, if not third look to find out it was all promotional.
Considering that the Singapore explosion story was directly fed to those interested enough in the series to follow it on Twitter, however, means that this would only happen if fans were duped into thinking that, yes, this was a real breaking news story.
Even if they weren't, the number of retweets removing the snippet from its context could have exposed those with a personal connection to Singapore. Without awareness of the stunt, the story would misinform and worry those with family in the state.
Looking at the replies, it seems people were categorically annoyed and/or bewildered by the sudden change in focus for the account. In that sense, then, the experiment backfired. Trying to grab someone's attention by appropriating social media's strengths during breaking news, while trying to momentarily fool people into thinking real people are dying, is hard to defend.
Who was the audience for this?
As someone who has a minimum amount of story-based knowledge about Call of Duty as it is, I can't say that the Current Events Agg. masquerade has taught me much about the game or increased my interest in it. Instead, it stands solely as a notable failure in marketing, an attempt to grab some attention by playing to the strengths of social media during actual military action. While we're here talking about the game, it's not like Black Ops 3 was hurting for mainstream attention.
This can also be seen as an example of that fabled "bad press" for an upcoming game release.
The account has since changed back to its standard franchise branding, and tried to play off today's events with a clarifying tweet:
Utilizing a non-fictional country as the center of a realistic story in order to advertise a work of fiction based on a dystopian future is marketing from beyond the realm of any logic. This was a bad idea, and should never have happened.
In early December we posted a report titled "Samsung's New Mobile Division President says 2016 will be Tough," followed by a secondary report on January 4 wherein Kwon Oh Hyun, vice chairman and co-chief executive officer, noted that "products including smartphones, televisions and memory chips will face escalated competition this year. Innovative business models are weakening traditional hardware values and workers must adapt to maintain leadership in an industry changing at its fastest pace ever. The territories of industries are collapsing. We have to compete in a new way that we've never experienced in the past." Today Samsung reviewed their preliminary status for Q4 2015 and it was dismal as expected.
Announcing its earnings guidance for the October-December period, Samsung estimated that its operating income would stand at 6.1 trillion won (US$5.1 billion), down 17.46 percent from the previous quarter. The operating profit missed an average market estimate of 6.67 trillion won, announced by financial research firm FnGuide earlier this week, and the figure is far below 6.9 trillion won forecast by many market analysts. Samsung's final quarterly results will only be made known later this month after an external audit.
The report further noted that "The prices of DRAM, a flagship chip product of the Korean firm, hovered at around $3.75 earlier last year but nosedived below $2 in recent months, undermining the profitability of Samsung's chip business."
Korean sources noted that "Market analysts pointed to the sluggish performances of the company's smartphone, chip and electronics component units are the main culprits behind the profit drop. Squeezed by Apple in the high-end smartphone segment and Chinese upstarts, including Xiaomi, in the low-end sector, Samsung is struggling to maintain its crown as the world's largest smartphone-maker.
In a bid to revive its tumbling smartphone business, Samsung reportedly plans to roll out its next flagship smartphone Galaxy S7 in February, a month earlier than usual." We reported on this development in-depth in a late December report titled "Samsung Hopes to Stop Android Switchers to the iPhone with their new Galaxy S7 Line-up Scheduled for February."
In recent months Samsung has announced that they would seek out new markets to compete in so as to drive new profits sources. Some of the areas of interest include the Internet-of-Things (IoT) market, biosensors, electronics and components for vehicles and drones so as to get away from the downward trend in smartphone profits.
In fact today it's being reported in Korea that "it is confirmed that Samsung Electronics' Wireless Business Department formed a task force end of 2015 to enter drone business. A person with a vice-president stature has become the director of this task force that is made up of about 15 employees. Task force is currently investigating drone markets, regulations, technologies, application areas in details and already agreed with certain global businesses, which holds communication technologies between motor controller, sensor, and device, about supplying parts and technologies. As of right now, Samsung Electronics is going to challenge drone business with communication technologies, which are fundamental capabilities that Wireless Business Department possesses."
While Samsung has been on a downward trend for well over a year with no end in sight, all eyes will now be on Apple when they announce their financials on January 26. While the iPhone 6s was launched with great expectations for continued growth, recent rumors and downgrades from brokers and even Apple bulls suggest that the iPhone 6s may have lost some steam at the end of the quarter. However, Apple has been known to crush media speculation and so it'll be interesting to see what Apple announces later this month..

Democratic lawmakers are making yet another attempt to pass legislation against racial profiling in local law enforcement. On Wednesday, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., and Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., announced they would re-introduce the End Racial Profiling Act for at least the third time in the last three sessions of Congress. Previous bills have failed to get hearings or clear the Senate and House committees with law enforcement oversight.
The latest measure, coming as tensions rise between police and communities of color amid a wave of police killings of black men, would stop police officers from racially profiling African-Americans and Latinos, as well as Muslims, Sikhs and other minority groups that have long complained of targeting by law enforcement. Last year, the Department of Justice expanded policies that protect racial and religious minorities from profiling by federal law enforcement agencies.
The DOJ rules don't apply to state, county and local law enforcement; the proposed law would expand on them by requiring states to certify their compliance with policies discouraging racial profiling. The announcement by Cardin and Conyers was welcomed Wednesday by civil rights leaders and activists.
“Racial profiling robs people of their dignity, undermines the integrity of our criminal justice system and instills fear and distrust among members of targeted communities,” Wade Henderson, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said in a statement.
Studies have shown how generally ineffective and counter-productive racial profiling has been as a law enforcement tool, Henderson said. Officers can become overly distracted by racial stereotypes and overlook individuals posing serious threats to public security, he said. But despite the evidence of its ineffectiveness, racial profiling expanded after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, D.C., in the guise of counterterrorism and immigration enforcement.
Senate and House versions of the law were introduced one day after the “March 2 Justice,” a group of activists against racial profiling and police brutality who walked 250 miles from New York to the U.S. Capitol, arrived in Washington. The group met Wednesday with members of Congress to urge passage of the racial profiling ban.

Every year nearly 4,000 churches close their doors. The reasons for that could be as various as the people that make them up. This statistic has been used by many when talking about the decline of faith in the United States. I believe using this statistic to back up the notion of godlessness is highly unfair. This is one Pastor who believes that some of those churches should have closed their doors. I also will make the claim that there are many other churches out there that need to follow suit and close their doors as well. Instead of making shocking statements let me just list a few reasons when its time for a church close. As you read this list some mentioned can be fixed, however it takes drastic changes.
The family church. (literally)
If the church you attend is exactly like a Christmas gathering because all you see is relatives, then it is time to stop. That is not a church its a venue for a weekly family function. I'm not saying that what could be happening in that church is not godly. What I'm saying is you need fellowship and community with other believers that are not named cousin or grandpa. Family churches also are some of the most unhealthy, just like family businesses. For the reason of everything is personal.
The false teaching church.
For those of you that might think I'm just picking on the small church I'm not. There are mega churches of 10,000 plus people that have left the truth of the Gospel behind, and they need to close up shop as well. Romans 16: 17-18 tells us: I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them. For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people.
There are churches that exist today under the guidance of individuals who have nothing in it besides their own personal satisfaction. Christianity is not this warm tingling feeling. Christianity is the intentional life change that happens when we discover Jesus. Christianity knows Jesus is real, nowhere does it say the church or Jesus is there to make you happy, successful, or popular. If a church is not intentionally pointing people to the cross daily, I would question if they are a church.
The “we” centered church.
This is the church that neglects the great commission in Matthew 28. The church is called to be the light to the world, not to just the people warming its pews. This is the question of is our church missional, are we prayerfully, monetarily, and spiritually supporting outreach to the ends of the earth. Phrases this church makes: “We just need to focus on our needs right now” “Our local community is the only mission field for us” “The people of the church are called to tithe, but the church doesn't have too.” It is scary to look across the country and observe how many churches have fallen into the isolationistic mentality. For even the apostles in acts knew the mission was to take the Gospel to the ends of the earth.
The prodigal son church.
To the church that broke unity for issues based on preferences and personality differences. There are a multitude of churches that exist today because a leader with some members left and started their own. I first want to say this is sad, and shows why the world calls us hypocrites. Yes, I am sure you feel justified. Yes, I even acknowledge that you believe what you did is right. My only question is we teach people to reconcile with their brothers and sisters in Christ that is spoken of in Matthew chapter five. Does that not apply here?
If you broke unity for worship style, wasn't the more righteous approach sitting down and breaking bread, and calmly talking about vision. If you broke unity because you feel like a church leader let you down; Can I honestly tell you that every Church leader will let you down at some point. I call this the prodigal son church for the hope that down the line someone reflects on their church and the motives that started it, and then with the awareness of God knows unity is to be had.
I am aware some might not like the list I came up with. Please understand that I write this for the reason of discussion. The only one on the list that really is not up for discussion is the second point. Something else to think about is of the 4,000 churches that closed last year, was Gods hand in that? I will fully admit that there will never be a perfect church in this country or on this planet. I do however strongly urge all of us to be aware of how effective, and Godly our churches are when it comes to carrying out the mission for Christ.
Everyone of us can make a difference, the healthier the believer the healthier the church! As you read this whether you are just the church goer or a pastor, know there is something we can all do. That something is being reflective on our own spiritual lives and proactively working on our lives. Lastly we all must remember we all still have something to learn, so sit at the feet of Jesus and take it all in.
We've got a live one this week, a battle for the ages.
We asked our authors to deliver unto us tales about genies.
Now, these mythical creatures have had many forms throughout literature in tons of different cultures, so we got a little more specific.
Our authors were to take the more modern approach this topic, focusing on a creature who was capable of granting three wishes. As to the rules of this magic and the look of the creature, we gave them free reign.
Which author will get their wish?
Who will get trapped back in the bottle?
Let's find out.
Albert Berg represents the arena with “The Lives of Leylo Toolmoon.”
Daniel Hale battles back with “The Widower's Djinn.”
The War of the Wishes is on.
Read, comment, vote, enjoy!
We have two judges that will render their decision by Friday. The third vote comes from you, the readers. We ask that you read both stories objectively, and then leave a comment below or on the story itself. Authors are not allowed to comment on their own stories, but we're sure they'll be checking in here. We'll tally up the totals and announce our champion on Friday.
Real Madrid were crowned champions of the 2015 Copa del Rey in Las Palmas, Gran Canaria after beating Barcelona in another massive final, marked by the heart with which they played, great defence, and, of course, the third quarter (15-23). The MVP Rudy Fernández (16 points and a PIR of 26), was well supported by Ayón, Sergio Rodríguez and Maciulis (each with 10) and this allowed the "King of the Copa" to further their mythical status in the tournament, winning the title for the 25th time in history. The set ups for the final were defensive. Neither team was willing to give anything away. For Madrid, the work of the Reyes-Ayón pairing on Tomic, leaving him with 0 points for the quarter, and the huge presence of Rudy (5 points, 3 assists), also cancelling out Hezonja, allowed them to go ahead in the first quarter (11-14, min. 8). The entry of Abrines (two three-pointers) and points from Satoransky (7) broke the dominating sense of evenness with an 8-3 run (21-17, min. 10). In the second quarter, Pascual's men began to get an advantage with their favourite play, the pick & roll between Huertas and Tomic. The Croatian center woke up, scoring 13 points in the quarter and he began to do damage to the Madrid defence. A 2+1 from him put Barcelona 7 points up in the 18th minute (42-35). Rudy keeps Madrid in the game However, Laso's men once again showed the mental fortitude that had got them to the final. Just like in the semi-final against Joventut, Laso used Maciulis and Bourousis to strengthen the Whites' game. And so, along with Nocioni's commitment (two hugely important blocks) and Rudy showing his best defensive form (four steals and a PIR of 19 at half-time), Madrid sprinted into the final stretch of the quarter with a 6-0 run, that finished with a steal and dunk from the Mallorcan forward that had fans on their feet in the Gran Canaria Arena (42-41, min. 20).
From the beginning of the game, the attacking game was played out close to the ring. Madrid were having a bad day in terms of three-point shooting (1/10 at half-time). Barcelona were not having a great time either (3/18) but they did have attacking rebounds in their arsenal (twice the number of their opponent). Doellman and Tomic especially, were getting the better of the Madrid centers, while Rudy was doing everything for Madrid (52-47, min. 26).
Two three-pointers change the game's dynamic
Madrid began to score from outside the three-point area and to equal the number of rebounds and things changed drastically for them. They enjoyed their best minutes. A three-pointer from Rudy and another immediately after by Nocioni for a toal of three, including one from Maciulis, along with great work from Ayón scoring under the hoop and stopping Tomic (10 points), led to a 5-11 run with a hook shot from the Mexican on the buzzer that turned the game around (57-64, min. 30).
All set another heart-stopping final quarter
Barcelona worked themselves to exhaustion with Thomas, Satoransky and the emergence of Navarro in the final stage of the game; Madrid held them back with Maciulis and Sergio Rodríguez. The tension of playing for the title really started to show. Slaughter had to be everywhere for the Whites to ease the absences of Ayón and Reyes due to personal fouls (four from the captain) in another game where the opponents were often to be found at the free-throw line, with some controversial decisions. Navarro took advantage of a technical foul to level the score at 71 all.
Hungry for titles
Madrid put everything they had into defence. They fought tooth and nail and drowned out Barcelona with a great defence over the next two blaugrana attacks. Two free-throws from Maciulis and a penetrating breakthrough from El Chacho with seven seconds remaining almost decided the game at 71-75, and Nocioni added the finishing touch with two free-throws (71-77, min. 40). Madrid takes the title again with Florentino Pérez watching from the Royal Box at the Gran Canaria Arena.
FC BARCELONA 71 (21+21+15+14): Satoransky (11), Oleson (4), Hezonja (0), Doellman (11), Tomic (25) -starting five-; Huertas, Abrines (7), Navarro (6), Thomas (7), Lampe, Nachbar, Pleiss.
REAL MADRID 77 (18+23+23+13): Llull, Carroll (5), Rudy Fernández (16), Ayón (10) and Reyes (8) -starting five-; S. Rodríguez (10), Campazzo, Maciulis (8), Rivers (2), Nocioni (10), Bourousis (4) and Slaughter (4).

Josh Hamilton came off the disabled list and rejoined the Rangers just in time to play his old team this weekend, but the former MVP doesn't think facing the Angels three months after they ate most of his contract to make him go away is a big deal.
Here's what Hamilton told Scott Boeck of USA Today about the three-game series in Texas that starts tonight:
I don't do anything more different than I usually do before the game. Maybe the focus is a little more there. But nothing to get back at a team for any reason, just like when I left (Texas). When I came back, I was like just treat it like any old road game. I'm going to treat this like any other home game. It will be good to see the guys. All or most of them were behind me when we met in Houston and had lunch. Everybody was cool.
Angels manager Mike Scioscia has a much different view of the situation, saying earlier this week that he hopes Hamilton “will take an opportunity to thank the teammates that supported him and to reach out to (Angels owner) Arte (Moreno) and let Arte know that maybe some of the things he did weren't what he signed up to do.”
Then, when pressed further, Scioscia said: “We'll leave it at that.”
Hamilton's drug and alcohol problems are well-documented, but Scioscia's quotes when combined with the Angels doing everything they could to make sure Hamilton never played for them again following his relapse are, at the very least, not a good look for anyone involved.
Meanwhile, according to Hamilton he's “tried many times” to get in touch with Moreno and the Angels owner refuses to meet with him. So maybe next time Scioscia should go public with his thoughts on how Moreno ought to be handling the situation instead.

If you're reading this, you already know just how rare a public appearance by "genius fashion dictator" — as her super fan, cult director John Waters, once called her — Rei Kawakubo is. The Japanese anti-fashion force behind Comme des Garçons and Dover Street Market hasn't posed for a portrait since 2004, never takes a finale bow at her own fashion shows, and even sent Waters to accept her CFDA Award in 2012. But she's not a complete recluse.
Last year, attendees of Gosha Rubchinskiy's fall/winter 16 show arrived to find the icon sitting in the Russian wunderkind's front row. This afternoon in Paris, she and husband Adrian Joffe were feeling Balenciaga's Bern in the second row at Demna Gvasalia's sophomore menswear outing as head of the Spanish house.
Although Kawakubo's presence at Rubchinskiy's show was very well documented on social media (according to Vogue, attendees snapped their stories with "the evangelical vigor of a religious group that had just seen their god"), her Balenciaga appearance was a bit more under the radar. This show-goer took a picture of Balenciaga's Bernie Sanders jacket, and so happened to get Rei in the frame.
Though a Kawakubo spotting is itself a shock, it isn't surprising that she'd choose to emerge for Gvasalia or Rubchinskiy's shows. Dover Street Market doesn't simply carry both brands, Gosha falls under Comme des Garçons production and distribution umbrella. Gvasalia's Vetements collective recently collaborated with Comme on a series of queer and fetish-inspired sweaters. Hope somebody saved one for Waters.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the federal agency dealing with Ebola, anthrax, measles, avian flu, and other issues involving public health, has come under fire for what a panel of experts says are inadequate lab safety practices and procedures.
The independent panel was named last year after a series of safety lapses at CDC facilities, including the accidental exposure of 80 unprotected workers to pathogenic anthrax at CDC's Bioterrorism Rapid Response and Advanced Technology lab in June.
"Leadership commitment toward safety has been inconsistent and insufficient at multiple levels," the report states. "Safety, including lab safety, is viewed by many as something separate from and outside the primary missions of public health and research. Safety is not integrated into strategic planning and is not currently part of the CDC culture, enterprise-wide.”
“Individual divisions, teams and lab groups have taken it upon themselves to implement safety programs, but this is not done in a consistent manner, nor is it done across the CDC,” the report charges. “A clearly articulated CDC safety mission, vision or direction is lacking.”
The report is dated Jan. 13, but the CDC only just released the findings this week.
In response to the report, the agency said on its website: “CDC concurs with these recommendations, has made progress towards implementing them, and will soon report on that progress. CDC's aim is to improve the culture of laboratory safety across the agency and minimize the risks associated with laboratory work.”
CDC Director Tom Frieden, a medical doctor, convened the panel last year after several incidents involving failures in safety procedures. In December, specimens of the Ebola virus were mixed up and a lab worker was potentially exposed. In another incident, a biological specimen that had been cross-contaminated with a more pernicious strain of bird flu was sent to a US Department of Agriculture facility.
In congressional testimony last July, Rutgers University's Richard Ebright, a professor of chemistry and chemical biology, noted reports of “biosafety and biosecurity engineering flaws and equipment failures at CDC select-agent laboratories, including inadequate provisions for emergency backup power (essential to maintain safety and security containment in the event of a power outage), failure to maintain negative-pressure airflow in biocontainment areas (essential to ensure safety and security containment at all times), non-functioning doors between biocontainment areas and corridors, non-functioning door seals between biocontainment areas and corridors, and jury-rigged repairs to door seals with duct tape.”
The “laboratory safety workgroup” convened by Dr. Frieden included experts in biosafety, laboratory science, and research. The group reviewed CDC incident reports and safety policies, visited CDC labs, conducted a lab safety culture survey, and met with internal staff and leadership. The 11-member panel was co-chaired by Joseph Kanabrocki, associate vice president for research safety at the University of Chicago, and University of Florida emeritus professor Kenneth Berns.
“Interviews and surveys demonstrated that many employees neither understand the agency's response to accidents nor how that information is communicated to the larger agency community outside immediately affected labs,” the group reported. “Disturbingly, the negative responses peak among those individuals who work at BSL3 and 4, especially among those holding a master's degree.”
Biosafety Level 3 and Biosafety Level 4 labs (BSL3 and 4) deal with the most dangerous bacteria, viruses, and toxins.

The report makes many recommendations. These include:
Establishing a standardized lab safety training curriculum, as well as standardized methods for competency skills mapping and refresher training.
Establishing an external review and accreditation process for all CDC labs.
Hiring a director to oversee lab safety.
Rewarding researchers who run safe labs.
Documenting the risks and benefits of proposed experimental work before the work is begun
“Efforts to establish a culture of responsible science and accountability are of critical importance,” the report emphasizes. “This culture of responsible science will require prompt and accurate reporting of incidents or breaches in standard protocol without fear of reprimand or punishment.”
Responding to the report and its recommendations, CDC Chief Operating Officer Sherri Berger said in a statement, “It's critical that we continue to solicit feedback on how we can improve our operations, especially functions as critical as lab safety. We brought this group of external experts together over the summer to assist us with identifying and implementing solutions, of which many are already underway.”

In one scene she presents to the front office a list of misfits they will invite springing training. NO RECENT ACTIVITY? Darn right there was no recent activity from Darrin Morris. Here are the WBO's super middleweight (168 pounds) rankings from December, from their own Web Site and in their own words unedited. He moved up in January one spot but the WBO altered that list. After each name there are comments on the fighters. This makes the story even more unreal.
Champion: Joe Calzaghe (30-0) - GB - Defended his title on December 16 by defeating then second ranked Richie Woodhall (26-3) via a tenth round TKO.
1 - Mario Veit (28-0) - GER - WBO Inter-Continental Champion. Knocked out Erol McDonald (29-11-1) in three rounds on August 12.
2 - Freeman Barr (19-2) - BAH - NABO Champion. Last fought on November 21, against Ricky Ramirez (TKO3).
3 - Andrei Schalikov (38-5-2) - RUS - Fought to a six round draw with Youssef Temsoury (9-10-1) on November 21. Mistakenly switched positions with Freeman Barr on the November rankings.
4 - Byron Mitchell (22-1-1) - USA - Did not fight in December.
5 - Dana Rosenblatt - USA - Last defeated Will McIntyre (24-2) on October 13.
6 - Darrin Morris (27-2-1) - USA -No recent activity.
7 - James Butler (16-1) - USA - No activity reported. After Woodhall drops from second to eight, Butler moves one spot in the rankings.
8 - Richie Woodhall (26-3) - GB - On December 16 lost by a tenth round TKO in his title fight with Champion Joe Calzaghe and drops from number two to number eight in the rankings.
9 - Omar Sheika (21-2) - USA - Defeated Lloyd Bryan (20-5) with a technical knockout on the first round on November 24.
10 - Frank Liles (32-2) - USA - No recent activity reported.

Poorly researched rankings are a significant reason why fighters routinely abandon their belts to box prominent colleagues in big-money matchups rather than defend their titles against some cadaver. Would boxing fans watch Oscar De La Hoya fight Fernando Vargas with no belt at stake? You bet they would. Mike Tyson hasn't held a title for years, yet he remains the most influential fighter on the planet. Then there is the plethora of current champions the average fan wouldn't know if he shoveled dirt on him. The fact Morris was ranked for so long postmortem also establishes the irrelevance of the WBO. Are people paying so little attention that nobody -- not a manager, promoter, trainer, fighter -- in Detroit (where Morris was born) or the Miami area (where Morris lived) noticed this blunder for 10 months? It wasn't as if Morris was anonymous. He twice held minor world titles, had been ranked by the IBF and once was a sparring partner for Sugar Ray Leonard. "He slipped through the cracks," Volkman said. "With the many different divisions that we have, it's impossible to keep up with everyone intelligently. We're going to have to do a better job. "He's a lucky guy. It's hard to track who they're fighting and how they're doing." Lucky guy? Is he serious? Lucky like what, road kill? The only way Morris could have been luckier in death is if he had been rated the top contender. Perhaps if he had died in a different manner he could have done better. No. 1 with a bullet.

Some of the 1,250 people working at the year-old laboratory say its open-plan layout, designed to produce collaboration, makes it hard to focus on work
It is a £700m cathedral to biomedical science, where scientists work together to make breakthroughs in cancer, neuroscience, pandemics and genetics. But the Francis Crick Institute is not proving to be the easiest place to concentrate.
A year after opening, some of the 1,250 people working at the Crick Institute, in its central London laboratory, have complained that the open plan design, intended to assist informal collaboration, means some areas set aside for thinking and writing up research are too noisy.
Chattering members of the public and colleagues celebrating PhD awards have been cited by those who, anecdotal evidence suggests, have been struggling to adapt to working alongside the building's cavernous atrium.
“There are individuals that complain,” said Nicholas Luscombe, leader of one of the Crick's research groups. “Some people like the background noise as if they were working in a cafe. Some want absolute silence and it's not great for that. My view is the layout has been extremely successful in terms of what it set out to achieve. You keep bumping into people and that has created new collaborations for me.”
The Crick is carrying out tests on noise levels and examining whether the acoustics need to be improved, a spokeswoman said.
Francis Crick Institute: cathedral of science 'looks better from 1,000 ft' Read more
Dr Kerstin Sailer, reader in social and spatial networks at University College London's Bartlett School of Architecture, who is researching the way the building is performing, said “some people say it is very loud, specifically those spaces close to the atrium”.
“One person said you get visitors coming in, public events, people celebrating passing their PhD so there is a lot of background noise,” she said. “The other problem that is hard to solve is that it is all hard surfaces so sound buffering is harder than in an office space.”
She said only a handful of other people in the building had made similar points but estimated that the noise has the potential to affect about a quarter of the people in the building. She stressed that the positive aspects of the open plan design, allowing greater collaboration, may well outweigh any drawbacks.
“The building was designed to maximise opportunities for scientists working in different areas of research to meet and share ideas, and feedback from our staff suggests that this is happening,” said the Crick's chief operating officer, Sam Barrell. “Since moving in last year, we are continuing to optimise the building to provide the best working environment for everyone.”

The noise issue in Britain's flagship new laboratory emerged as one of its antecedents from the 1960s was hailed by architectural experts as among the country's best designed workplaces. The laboratory of molecular biology in Cambridge was where Sir Francis Crick worked after winning the 1962 Nobel prize for decoding DNA with Jim Watson.
It was praised by the dean of the Bartlett, Prof Alan Penn, who has been examining how open-plan offices affect behaviour in workplaces ranging from advertising agencies to science labs. They believe they have identified layouts which maximise “creative interplay” between workers without obliterating altogether the quiet many people need to work effectively.
In a lecture on Tuesday – titled “Who likes working in open plan?” – Penn identified the laboratory as a leading example of workplace design. He said his research revealed how the building blended cellular laboratories with busy circulation spaces, allowing scientists from different research groups to effectively share ideas.
“What we observed is that people walking around would stop and join a conversation in a door of a laboratory,” said Penn. “What was going on was that conversations inside the laboratory were next to where the large scale movement along the corridor. That led to discussions between research groups. Proof of that interplay was evident at meal times. The groups around the tables were mixed from all groups. You got inter-disciplinary interactions taking place.”
By contrast, the researchers concluded the former Cancer Research UK laboratory in Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, was less conducive to interaction and that scientists were less likely to mix at meal times.
The researchers concluded the design also hampered quiet thinking because conversations would take place “next to people who were reading and writing where they had knocked through areas. That disturbed people who were reading and writing”, said Penn.
The impact of office layout on creativity was understood by Steve Jobs, who reportedly obsessed over ways to structure the atrium when planning a new office for Pixar, and even where to locate the toilets, so that serendipitous personal encounters would occur.
Penn's research suggests that open-plan offices function well by allowing people to see each other and so “recruit” each other to help with tasks or solve problems.
An analysis of the HHCL advertising agency, which devised the “You've been Tango-ed” ads, found the perception of a staff member's usefulness was directly related to how much they were seen on the open-plan office floor.
“With a few exceptions, such as with top executives, never being seen means you are found less useful,” said Penn.
They found staff “recruited” other visible employees. “If you walk past someone who wants to talk to you, they will flag you down,” said Penn. “It may be only 30 seconds but useful information is exchanged. If you have an open plan system that doesn't let people recruit people like some of these cubicle farms, then you get all of the disruption and all of the noise but none of the benefits of recruiting people.”
Prof Alan Penn's dos and don'ts of office design
Do take account of different types of staff in your organisation; some jobs need territory, some are nomadic.
Do have “contemplative” areas for your staff to think, read or write.
Do create space for creative interaction where staff can randomly bump into each other and chat, and organise the circulation so that different groups or divisions are brought together.
Don't go too far in reducing the number of desks in pursuit of agile working, eg below the average number of staff in the office.
Don't assume that only the boss needs to have an office when the office junior might need top concentration to do their work.
Don't install cubicles in the hope of reducing interruptions, they stop you from recruiting passers by into conversation, and are not effective in reducing noise.
In a previous post in the Rails Performance series we stated that the default garbage collection settings for Ruby on Rails applications are not optimal. In this post we'll explore the basics of object age in RGenGC, Ruby 2.1's new restricted generational garbage collector.
As a prerequisite of this and subsequent posts, basic understanding of a mark and sweep1 collector is assumed.
A somewhat simplified mark and sweep cycle goes like this:
A mark and sweep collector traverses the object graph. It checks which objects are in use (referenced) and which ones are not. This is called object marking, aka. the MARK Phases. All unused objects are freed, making their memory available. This is called sweeping, aka. the SWEEP Phases. Nothing changes for used objects.
A GC cycle prior to Ruby 2.1 works like that. A typical Rails app boots with 300 000 live objects of which all need to be scanned during the MARK phase. That usually yields a smaller set to SWEEP.
A large percentage of the graph is going to be traversed over and over again but will never be reclaimed. This is not only CPU intensive during GC cycles, but also incurs memory overhead for accounting and anticipation for future growth.
Old and young objects
What generally makes an object old?
All new objects are considered to be young.
Old objects survived at least one GC cycle (major or minor) The collector thus reasons that the object will stick around and not become garbage quickly.
The idea behind the new generational garbage collector is this:
MOST OBJECTS DIE YOUNG.
To take advantage of this fact, the new GC classifies objects on the Ruby heap as either OLD or YOUNG. This segregation now allows the garbage collector to work with two distinct generations, with the OLD generation much less likely to yield much improvement towards recovering memory.
For a typical Rails request, some examples of old and new objects would be:
Old: compiled routes, templates, ActiveRecord connections, cached DB column info, classes, modules etc.
compiled routes, templates, ActiveRecord connections, cached DB column info, classes, modules etc. New: short lived strings within a partial, a string column value from an ActiveRecord result, a coerced DateTime instance etc.
Young objects are more likely to reference old objects than old objects referencing young objects. Old objects also frequently reference other old objects.
1 2 u = User . first # [email protected] ", encrypted_password: "blahblah...", reset_password_token: nil, reset_password_sent_at: nil, remember_created_at: nil, sign_in_count: 2, current_sign_in_at: "2014-10-31 11:52:30", last_sign_in_at: "2014-10-29 10:04:01", current_sign_in_ip: "127.0.0.1", last_sign_in_ip: "127.0.0.1", created_at: "2014-10-29 10:04:01", updated_at: "2014-11-30 14:07:15", provider: nil, uid: nil, first_name: "dfdsfds", last_name: "dfdsfds", confirmation_token: nil, confirmed_at: "2014-10-30 10:11:42", confirmation_sent_at: nil, unconfirmed_email: nil, onboarded_at: nil>
Notice how the transient attribute keys and names reference the long lived columns here:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 { "id" => #<ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQLAdapter::OID::Integer:0x007fbe756d1d30>, "email" => #<ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQLAdapter::OID::Identity:0x007fbe756d1718>, "encrypted_password" => #<ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQLAdapter::OID::Identity:0x007fbe756d1718>, "reset_password_token" => #<ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQLAdapter::OID::Identity:0x007fbe756d1718>, "reset_password_sent_at" => #<ActiveRecord::AttributeMethods::TimeZoneConversion::Type:0x007fbe741f63c0 @column = #<ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQLAdapter::OID::Timestamp:0x007fbe756d0e58>>,
Age segregation is also just a classification – old and young objects aren't stored in distinct memory spaces – they're just conceptional buckets. The generation of an object refers to the amount of GC cycles it survived:
1 2 3 4 irb ( main ): 00 9 : 0 > ObjectSpace . dump ( [] ) => "{ \" address \" : \" 0x007fd24c007668 \" , \" type \" : \" ARRAY \" , \" class \" : \" 0x007fd24b872038 \" , \" length \" :0, \" file \" : \" (irb) \" , \" line \" :9, \" method \" : \" irb_binding \" , \" generation \" :8, \" flags \" :{ \" wb_protected \" :true}}
" irb ( main ): 010 : 0 > GC . count => 8
What the heck is major and minor GC?
You may have heard, read about or noticed in GC.stat output the terms “minor” and “major” GC.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 irb ( main ): 003 : 0 > pp GC . stat { :count => 32 , :heap_used => 1181 , :heap_length => 1233 , :heap_increment => 50 , :heap_live_slot => 325148 , :heap_free_slot => 156231 , :heap_final_slot => 0 , :heap_swept_slot => 163121 , :heap_eden_page_length => 1171 , :heap_tomb_page_length => 10 , :total_allocated_object => 2050551 , :total_freed_object => 1725403 , :malloc_increase => 1462784 , :malloc_limit => 24750208 , :minor_gc_count => 26 , :major_gc_count => 6 , :remembered_shady_object => 3877 , :remembered_shady_object_limit => 4042 , :old_object => 304270 , :old_object_limit => 259974 , :oldmalloc_increase => 23639792 , :oldmalloc_limit => 24159190 }
Minor GC (or “partial marking”): This cycle only traverses the young generation and is very fast. Based on the hypothesis that most objects die young, this GC cycle is thus the most effective at reclaiming back a large ratio of memory in proportion to objects traversed.
It runs quite often - 26 times for the GC dump of a booted Rails app above.
Major GC: Triggered by out-of-memory conditions - Ruby heap space needs to be expanded (not OOM killer! :-)) Both old and young objects are traversed and it's thus significantly slower than a minor GC round. Generally when there's a significant increase in old objects, a major GC would be triggered. Every major GC cycle that an object survived bumps its current generation.
It runs much less frequently - six times for the stats dump above.
The following diagram represents a minor GC cycle (MARK phase completed, SWEEP still pending) that identifies and promotes some objects to old.
A subsequent minor GC cycle (MARK phase completed, SWEEP still pending) ignores old objects during the mark phase.
Most of the reclaiming efforts are thus focussed on the young generation (new objects). Generally 95% of objects are dead by the first GC. The current generation of an object is the number of major GC cycles it has survived.
RGenGC
At a very high level C Ruby 2.1's collector has the following properties:
High throughput - it can sustain a high rate of allocations / collections due to faster minor GC cycles and very rare major GC cycles.
GC pauses are still long (“stop the world”) for major GC cycles.
Generational collectors have much shorter mark cycles as they traverse only the young generation, most of the time.
This is a marked improvement to the C Ruby GC and serves as a base for implementing other advanced features moving forward. Ruby 2.2 supports incremental GC and object ages beyond just old and new definitions. A major GC cycle in 2.1 still runs in a “stop the world” manner, whereas a more involved incremental implementation (Ruby 2.2) interleaves short steps of mark and sweep cycles between other VM operations.
Object references
In this simple example below we create a String array with three elements.
1 2 3 4 5 6 irb ( main ): 001 : 0 > require 'objspace' => true irb ( main ): 002 : 0 > ObjectSpace . trace_object_allocations_start => nil irb ( main ): 003 : 0 > ary = %w(a b c) => [ "a" , "b" , "c" ]
Very much like a river flowing downstream, the array has knowledge of (a reference to) each of its String elements. On the contrary, the strings don't have an awareness of (or references back to) the array container.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 irb ( main ): 004 : 0 > ObjectSpace . dump ( ary ) => "{ \" address \" : \" 0x007fd24b890fd8 \" , \" type \" : \" ARRAY \" , \" class \" : \" 0x007fd24b872038 \" , \" length \" :3, \" embedded \" :true, \" references \" :[ \" 0x007fd24b891050 \" , \" 0x007fd24b891028 \" , \" 0x007fd24b891000 \" ], \" file \" : \" (irb) \" , \" line \" :3, \" method \" : \" irb_binding \" , \" generation \" :7, \" flags \" :{ \" wb_protected \" :true}}
" irb ( main ): 004 : 0 > ObjectSpace . reachable_objects_from ( ary ) => [ Array , "a" , "b" , "c" ] irb ( main ): 006 : 0 > ObjectSpace . reachable_objects_from ( ary [ 1 ] ) => [ String ] irb ( main ): 007 : 0 > ObjectSpace . dump ( ary [ 1 ] ) => "{ \" address \" : \" 0x007fd24b891028 \" , \" type \" : \" STRING \" , \" class \" : \" 0x007fd24b829658 \" , \" embedded \" :true, \" bytesize \" :1, \" value \" : \" b \" , \" encoding \" : \" UTF-8 \" , \" file \" : \" (irb) \" , \" line \" :3, \" method \" : \" irb_binding \" , \" generation \" :7, \" flags \" :{ \" wb_protected \" :true, \" old \" :true, \" marked \" :true}}
"
We stated earlier that:
Young objects are more likely to reference old objects, than old objects referencing young objects. Old objects also frequently reference other old objects.
However it's possible for old objects to reference new objects. What happens when old objects reference new ones?
Old objects with references to new objects are stored in a “remembered set”. The remembered set is a container of references from old objects to new objects and is a shortcut for preventing heap scans for finding such references.
Implications for Rails
As our friend Ezra used to say, “no code is faster than no code.” The same applies to automatic memory management. Every object allocation also has a variable recycle cost. Allocation generally is low overhead as it happens once, except for the use case where there are no free object slots on the Ruby heap and a major GC is triggered as a result.
A major drawback of this limited segregation of OLD vs YOUNG is that many transient objects are in fact promoted to old during large contexts such as a Rails request. These long lived objects eventually become unexpected “memory leaks”. These transient objects can be conceptually classified as of “medium lifetime” as they need to stick around for the duration of a request. There's however a large probability that a minor GC would run during request lifetime, promoting young objects to old, effectively increasing their lifetime to well beyond the end of a request. This situation can only be revisited during a major GC which runs infrequently and sweeps both old and young objects.
Each generation can be specifically tweaked, with the older generation being particularly important for balancing total process memory use with maintaining a minimal transient object set (young ones) per request. And subsequent too fast promotion from young to old generation.
In our next post we will explore how you'd approach tuning the Ruby GC for Rails applications, balancing tradeoffs of speed and memory. Leave your email address below and we'll let you know as soon as it's posted.

Europe has a problem and it is called Germany. The crisis that has bedevilled the single currency area for the past five years started with the smaller countries on the eurozone's periphery: Greece, Ireland, Portugal. Then it moved to the bigger countries of Southern Europe: Spain and Italy. Next the malaise spread to the second biggest economy: France.
All the time, though, the sense was that Germany – the powerhouse of the eurozone – was immune. Exports from the factories of Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia were booming. Business confidence was high. Growth was solid. While the core of the eurozone remained secure, there was nothing really to fear.
That was then. The story today is of waning confidence and drooping factory orders. The snapshot of German manufacturers shows that for the first time in more than a year industry is contracting rather than expanding. A temporary blip caused by the tension in Ukraine? In part, yes. Sentiment has clearly been affected by fears that Russia could decide to annex eastern Ukraine, while sanctions have affected exports.
But that's not the whole story. German exports were falling even before the escalation of the Ukraine crisis, and that was mainly due to falling demand from the rest of the eurozone. At Berlin's insistence, domestic demand has been squeezed across Europe. Everybody has been urged to cut costs, become more competitive and adopt the German model of export-led growth.
But if Spanish, Italian and Portuguese consumers lack spending power, they can't afford a spanking new BMW or a Miele washing machine. That means weaker German exports, lower German growth and in turn less demand for Spanish, Italian and Portuguese exports.
All of which explains the current state of the eurozone: a faltering recovery that poses the risk of a triple-dip recession and deflation. Growth stagnated in the second quarter this year and is on course to be no better in the third. Inflation, according to the flash estimate published this week, stands at 0.3%.
The experiment – German designed, German engineered and German exported – with austerity has failed. The eurozone is not cutting its way back to prosperity. It is cutting its way towards being the new Japan.
If policymakers in Berlin were willing to accept this, they might be prepared to see the sense in easing up on the spending cuts and wage reductions. They might even see virtue in a modern Marshall Plan for Europe, under which Germany would run down its budget surplus in order to boost spending not only in its own economy but in the rest of the eurozone.
But that is not going to happen. Instead, Germany will belatedly and begrudgingly drop its opposition to the European Central Bank using full-strength quantitative easing – buying government bonds to create money – to try to kickstart growth. Expect hints of QE to emerge from the ECB on Thursday.

3 Easy Tips on how to get Reclaimed Materials for your Tiny House Project
1. Be on the lookout for structures around you that are going to be demolished
2. Find the nearest Habitat For Humanity Restore nearest you
3. Use Craigslist and Free Cycle to look for free and cheap construction materials
Simple enough? I hope so 🙂 Here are some more tips I can leave you with…
Sometimes life is simply a numbers game. If you're not willing to do the hustling, nobody's going to do it for you. Well, maybe.. But I wouldn't count on it!
So if you want to find recycled goodies and you're serious about it- begin contacting at least three people everyday whether you find them in person or through the Internet.
And don't be afraid to ask for referrals when you don't have any luck. One person who can't help you may lead you to the chosen one if you simply ask.
Also- be willing to labor away for your materials. Sometimes you'll have to take the time to dismantle a barn or an old chicken coop. Who knows- just be willing to do it!

Sexology's war on transgender children
Anti-transgender reparative therapy, deemed unethical by experts and banned by politicians, is based on unconfirmed evidence. Could it be the latest high-profile sexology scam?
Last week Ontario banned anti-transgender reparative therapy, practiced for decades from an ideological home base at Toronto's Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH). The ban was one of many enacted in response to transgender teen Leelah Alcorn's suicide after being subjected to anti-transgender reparative therapy. Now the academic holdouts who support the practice are making their last stand in the court of public opinion, placing letters and op-eds in the Toronto Star, Los Angeles Times, and Wired. They always avoid mentioning their notorious published case report, the curing of eight-year-old Danny Ryan's “childhood gender identity disorder.” Danny's alleged cure has never been independently confirmed, and the whole case may be completely fabricated.
To understand the unethical history of anti-transgender reparative therapy, follow the money. The Archives of Sexual Behavior was founded by sexologist Richard Green in 1971, and he made his clinical and editorial goal clear in his first issue: “the prevention of transsexualism.” Green's team at UCLA was rewarded with funding for this goal. As described in Green's book The ‘Sissy Boy Syndrome,' his faction of sexologists basically believes gay people are born that way, but being transgender is a lifestyle choice that can be cured by subjecting young children to anti-transgender reparative therapy. Green's hand-picked editorial successor Kenneth Zucker has subjected hundreds of children to government-subsidized “therapeutic intervention,” and he uses the Archives to promulgate his views.
Though most gender non-conforming children do not make a gender transition later in life, clinics like Zucker's at CAMH make money from anxious parents by diagnosing Gender Identity Disorder in children, a disease Zucker and friends created in 1980. To cure it, Zucker developed a version of Green's clinical protocols: parents must shame or punish feminine boys who play with dolls, make art using pink or purple colors, draw pictures of girls, or seek out girls as playmates.
Danny Ryan's infamous cure narrative was published in 2003 by The National Academies Press following a secret peer review overseen by editor Stephen Mautner. Danny's case frames J. Michael Bailey's book The Man Who Would Be Queen, a series of vivid anecdotes about the sexual escapades of some adult trans women. In making the case for anti-transgender reparative therapy, Bailey portrays Zucker as a “rabbinical” man with “a Talmudic knowledge of the literature concerning childhood GID.” Bailey observes that Danny's transgender proclivities are cured in the book's epilogue, implying Danny was spared a “bad outcome.”
Unfortunately for Bailey, trans women portrayed pseudonymously in his book came forward and filed complaints with his employer Northwestern University, which opened a formal investigation. One history book described the transgender protests against sexology's academic exploitation as “one of the most organized and unified examples of transsexual activism to date.”
Most troubling was a report from one of Bailey's book subjects that he fabricated the outcome of the Danny Ryan case report. When questioned later, Bailey said, “Not only does Danny exist, but I am … I have several informants who keep me apprised of his development, and now he's a happy out gay man, as I predicted in the book.”
A 2008 academic panel discussed Bailey's book and the Danny Ryan case report. No journalist has ever investigated Bailey's claims that Ryan was cured of childhood gender identity disorder.
In 2008, Zucker devoted an issue of Archives to defending Bailey and attacking his transgender critics, anchored by a target article by Bailey's friend and Northwestern colleague Alice Dreger. Dreger interviewed Bailey's defenders on the Archives editorial board, but she talked to none of Bailey's prominent critics, including me.
After Northwestern refused to divulge whether they investigated the Danny Ryan allegations, Dreger mounted a successful trial by media for Bailey, concluding in the Archives, “I can find no evidence that Bailey fabricated anything meaningful in Danny's story.” Archives founder Green made a rare appearance since handing over the journal to Zucker, writing a piece mocking Bailey's transgender critics like me, titled “Lighten Up, Ladies.”
Dreger has mastered a form of self-promotion that journalist Lindsay Beyerstein described as “dishonest health reporting.” Dreger panders to a credulous blogosphere addicted to outrage by creating the appearance of objectivity and scholarly consensus. It's easy to make such attacks on a marginalized group like trans women, but after Dreger pulled the same stunt on a prominent pediatrician, she was the subject of an entire issue of the American Journal of Bioethics, which presented her modus operandi as “a case study in unethical transgressive bioethics.”
In March, Dreger repackaged her Bailey defense as the centerpiece of her new book Galileo's Middle Finger. Despite her attempts to no-platform any dissent, she presents herself as an academic folk hero standing up for academic freedom against threats to science, like Bailey's transgender critics. The Chronicle Review arm of the trade publication Chronicle of Higher Education even made Dreger their cover girl and wrote a glowing profile that suggested it's “liberal dogma” to demand evidence for her published claims.
Invoking Galileo in scientific disputes is so trite a cliché that anthropologist Thomas Lessl extensively researched the phenomenon, which he describes as “scientific folklore.” Every discipline has folklore, where historical facts get pared away, even fabricated outright, in favor of a memorable anecdote. Dreger first compared Bailey to Galileo in Zucker's Archives, lauding him as “spreading, supporting, and fiercely defending a truth too often denied and suppressed because of self-serving identity politics.”
Dreger's new book is best understood as an anthology of emergent academic folklore, attempts to create lively master narratives chronicling brave academic heroes pursuing The Truth™ regardless of consequences, idealized academic essence narratives. Lessl hypothesized that this kind of folklore develops in service of institutional demarcation, or “us versus them” boundary work of the sort one might find in identity politics. They're the kinds of stories academics share in faculty lounges and at cocktail parties: Grimm Brothers and Aesop for the intelligentsia, replete with dangerous monsters like fanatical trans women and heroic seekers of The Truth™ like Zucker, Dreger, and Bailey. What's really at its heart is the pro-am turf war over the production of knowledge, where people like Dreger now must compete with thinkers outside academia.
Dreger republished her defense of Bailey, most of it verbatim. What changed? Dreger quietly removed all her conclusions about the alleged Danny Ryan fabrication, without explanation. A fundamental aspect of any kind of research is to confirm facts about all the people involved and speak with all of them directly. Just ask Sabrina Rubin Erdeley. Since Dreger hypocritically pontificates in her book about the need for “evidence-based activism,” let's examine the evidence for Danny Ryan.
Everything we know about Danny Ryan comes from just one source: J. Michael Bailey. Dreger has never spoken with Danny, or Danny's parents and sister, or Danny's gay uncle, or the Northwestern student who introduced Bailey to Danny's family. We are supposed to take Dreger at her word that we must take Bailey at his word. Danny was cured and is an out and happy gay man. If he exists, Danny is in his mid-20s. Wouldn't it be ethical to confirm the existence of the Ryan family, whose members perfectly encapsulate Bailey's beliefs about gay and transgender people?
Danny Ryan has remarkable parallels to David Reimer, the infamous case report by Bailey's ideological nemesis John Money. Reimer's successful case report turned out to be a fabrication, and Reimer ultimately committed suicide. It also has troubling parallels to Kirk Murphy, the infamous case report of a child cured via anti-gay reparative therapy. Murphy's successful case report turned out to be a fabrication, and Murphy ultimately committed suicide.
The most troubling parallel is between Danny Ryan and Leelah Alcorn, the transgender teen subjected to anti-transgender reparative therapy. Alcorn committed suicide in late 2014, leaving behind two notes. Her hard copy note was thrown in the trash by her parents, but she scheduled the other to post online after she killed herself. In it, Alcorn said she wanted her suicide to mean something, begging all of us to “fix society.” That post was quickly deleted at her parents' request, but not before it was saved and shared, quickly generating an international response.
Dreger has compared children like Leelah Alcorn to a child she knew who wanted to be a train, all the time insisting she is an ally to transgender people. Bailey has been investigated twice, and his signature sexology course was taken away after he arranged a live “fucksaw” demonstration for students. In the wake of Alcorn's death, the Obama Administration came out against anti-transgender reparative therapy. In early 2015, Zucker's employer announced they were bringing in an external expert to review Zucker's clinical practices. Zucker's medical director Kwame McKenzie announced they have stopped accepting new patients to its Gender Identity Services clinic for youth because of outcry from the public and the newly-enacted ban.
Someone sent Dreger's book to noted scientist Lynn Conway, who is attacked in several chapters for criticizing Bailey's methods and teachings.The attached note says "A very personal 'Middle Finger' from me."
Can an entire academic journal be corrupt and unethical? Dreger claims that professional bioethicists ran an unethical journal, so is it possible that her like-minded friends at the Archives are unethical, too? Zucker has a self-evident conflict of interest in defending Bailey. Academics have noted that Dreger had a self-evident conflict of interest in defending Bailey. As evidence of their sociopathic trolling of their trans critics, someone mailed key Bailey critic Lynn Conway a copy of Dreger's book that omits Dreger's role in vetting the Danny Ryan case report. The note and mailing address say they're from J. Michael Bailey.
Academics continue to claim transgender activists are persecuting them, but who has the power here? Gender-variant children, or academics like Zucker, Bailey, and Dreger? Academics don't get assaulted and murdered so frequently that journalists rarely cover the crimes. Children who say they wish to teach college someday aren't subjected to shaming, aversion therapy, and parental punishment supervised by clinicians. David Reimer is dead by his own hand. Kirk Murphy is dead by his own hand. Leelah Alcorn is dead by her own hand. Can Danny Ryan and the children like him be saved?
Dreger sells what credulous academics want to believe and what lazy journalists and editors want to report. They're uncritically giving these academics platforms while transgender children are committing suicide. I'm not going to name and shame yet, but those same journalists have been unwilling to give equal time to those of us who question the legitimacy of Zucker, Bailey, and Dreger's evidence.
I'm issuing a clarion call for evidence-based activism, because history has shown that some academics can't be trusted to tell the truth. I'll believe Zucker, Bailey, and Dreger when I see independently confirmed evidence that the hundreds of Danny Ryans subjected to anti-transgender reparative therapy did not end up like Leelah Alcorn.

Dubai: Any regulation to create mandatory affordable housing for “all new residential developments in Dubai” would have to push property values to around, or even below, the Dh600 per square foot (psf) level. Currently, around Dh700psf is rated as the most accessible pricing to put a foot into Dubai's property market.
“Residential stock in Dubai Investments Park can be got at under Dh700, and there could be a couple of other freehold clusters where similar values could be quoted on some property units within,” said Chandrakant Whabi, CEO of Acrohouse Properties. “But there could be caveats attached as the units may not offer balconies or will have cramped views.”
Locations such as International City and Discovery Gardens, which were aimed at the budget-conscious investor, had seen sharp upturns in 2013, and instantly putting them out of reach for buyers in this category.
For the record, the priciest transaction for a villa in Dubai last year was for Dh58.3 million, for a 7,613 square feet villa on the Palm, according to Luxhabitat.
This is why the proposal by Dubai Municipality to introduce affordable housing quotas for all new residential developments in Dubai are significant. Only such a move would force developers to create a separate stock, even though they may be limited in numbers, which would encourage more of Dubai's tenants to buy properties for their own use. (Dubai had in the middle of the last decade sounded out similar options to create a stock of affordable housing, but which had to be put off after the financial crisis intervened.) Now, with transaction activity in the local market rather subdued, and the rental situation stabilising, the move to revive the proposal could have better traction. “With the introduction of the Federal mortgage caps and the doubling of property registration fees [in Dubai], we saw genuine end users forced into a holding pattern as they attempted to make the transition from rented accommodation to owner occupation,” Steven Morgan, CEO of Cluttons Middle East, said in a statement on Sunday.
“Now, with rents starting to show greater stability, households have a window of opportunity to consolidate their finances and make that leap to owner-occupation. The prospect of those on monthly incomes of between Dh4,000 and Dh12,000 being able to control their rental outgoings will no doubt go some way to aiding the speed at which deposits can be amassed.”
But creating affordable housing stock will not be easy in the more established of Dubai's freehold residential clusters. Land value has been gaining steadily in the last 24 months, and if developers were to offer units at “affordable” costs, they may have to “subsidise” the sale price. And compensate on the pricing they attach for the non-affordable housing they have created in the same development.
Charting this particular course represents the obvious difficulty for a developer. And it could also upset the balance that is so vital for a city in how it expands outwards.
“Dubai is clearly not short of affordable neighbourhoods — Karama and Satwa are two key stand out areas that evolved organically at the edges of the Deira-Bur Dubai and Jumeirah districts, respectively,” Faisal Durrani, Cluttons' International Research and Business Development Manager, said.
“Karama and Satwa have over time been absorbed into the city, but we would strongly argue against deliberately creating affordable areas through the sanctioning of off-site affordable housing provisions as there are social implications to consider alongside the impact it can have on the urban fabric of a city.”
“We are Ben Folds Five… When we started in Chapel Hill, NC in 1994 it was the heyday of grunge music. It was all guitars and no harmonies. Many said we didn't know what we were doing. They were right. And in 2012, we still don't. But we're not alone now. Because in 2012, nobody knows what they're doing. Except for Steve Jobs and Amanda Palmer.”
This is how Ben Folds Five opened their crowdfunding campaign video on Pledge Music.
Besides being incredibly funny to anyone who follows musician crowdfunding, it's also illuminating. Crowdfunding for musicians — particularly those who have had success releasing albums in the “traditional” way — is often thought of as an “experiment”.
But what's really more experimental: taking a loan from a record label where 9 out of 10 artists fail to turn a profit, or asking 100 or 1,000 or 10,000 or 100,000 of your biggest fans to finance the record with hardly any risk?
Even though Kickstarter raises more money for artists than the National Endowment for the Arts, crowdfunding is still an experiment?
Crowdfunding is no longer an experiment. It's a proven formula. We're still figuring out some of the details, but the theory is correct: fans want to support artists directly in exchange for exclusive access to the band and their creative output. If anything, it's this musician perception of crowdfunding as “experiment” that's slowing adoption — the fans are screaming at the top of their lungs asking for it like a back catalog request at a live show.
Musicians: the future is bright and under your control. Put on your shades and deal with it.
Of course, musicians themselves aren't solely responsible for failing to adapt. The market itself has been slow to respond to the specific needs that surround crowdfunding an album.
There are relatively few companies that understand crowdfunding is going to be the dominant way albums will be made in the future. Certainly, you have the meteoric rise of Kickstarter and Indiegogo, but they have broader missions to change the dynamic of funding creativity in general.
There are only two companies right now that are seriously and directly competing for album-specific crowdfunding. They are Sellaband and Pledge Music. It's unfortunate that their potential is to some degree being drowned out by the juggernauts of crowdfunding (Kickstarter and Indiegogo) because what musicians truly need is a crowdfunding platform created just for them.
There certainly aren't only two companies competing for a share of the direct-to-fan artist revenue stream. Topspin, Bandcamp, Soundcloud, Reverbnation, Bandzoogle… the list goes on. The definition of “crowdfunding” could be made broad enough to include them. Here, I'm talking specifically about platforms that actually have people on staff to work with artists and their managers to produce album-specific financing campaigns.
I'm going to focus on Pledge Music because they share many basic features with Sellaband, but also have several major differentiators that I consider genius. Sellaband is the more established of the two platforms and I'm not trying to diss them, I'm just really excited about the potential behind Pledge Music's particular approach.
Pledge Music is a managed music crowdfunding and retail marketing platform. The “managed” part? Pledge Music staff will actually set up and run your crowdfunding campaign, so it's “white glove” service for musicians and their managers. They're experts that will consult with your management and coordinate all efforts to minimize risk and ensure your fans are engaged and get exactly what they pay for. They've run the “experiment” of album crowdfunding enough to have established solid best practices for success, and have built the tools to facilitate that success.
You'll pay a standard and reasonable 15% cut that includes all payment processing fees. With respect to its crowdfunding component, it's analogous to what you know and love about Kickstarter or Indiegogo except for a few truly genius moves:
Crowdfunding campaigns don't end until the album is funded.
The dollar (or euro) amount being raised is hidden from public. They only see what percentage of the album is funded so far.
99% of musicians on the platform opt to give a small portion of the funds raised to the charity of their choice.
Musicians are encouraged to market to their fans through the platform with exclusive content as part of the value offering.
When the crowdfunding campaign ends, a pre-sale window begins.
That last move is critical. When you think about it, there's a blurry line between crowdfunding and a pre-sale. Most of the difference seems to be whether or not you have financing on the outset. So it makes perfect sense to start a pre-sale immediately after receiving financing. It's one of those “why didn't I think of that” strokes of genius that I see as the beating heart of Pledge Music's common sense approach.
It's the kind of sense that makes dollars. According to Pledge Music CEO Benji Rogers, my band left $1,661 on the table with when we recently raised $4,356 on Kickstarter.
That's because Rogers has research showing 37% of the money raised by Pledge Music album campaigns comes in after the crowdfunding period ended. Ouch. That could have gone a long way.
See, on Kickstarter or Indiegogo, you build tons of buzz in the closing moments of your campaign to push toward and beyond your goal. Our goal was $3,666, which we hit about ten days before our campaign ended. We were able to push another $700 past that by pulling out all the promotional stops.
A few weeks later, we put the album up for pre-sale. We figured we wouldn't get much interest because most of the fans that wanted it already got it through Kickstarter. But every day our inbox would pop up with new Bandcamp messages saying someone had pre-ordered the album. We saw the names and realized these weren't old fans, these were new fans we'd attracted while doing all the crowdfunding promotion.
The secret to Kickstarter and Indiegogo is that they capitalize on one simple fact: true fans want more. They want the full brunt of your creative force. That's why they're patronizing your work. They want your creativity maximized, they want to have a hand in exposing others to what they love about your work. They don't just want your music, they want your original lyric sheets, the shirt you wore on tour, and the bucket you puked in when you got off stage. Exclusivity is the new scarcity now that access to music is ubiquitous.
The average fan on Kickstarter contributed $39 to our campaign, as opposed to $5 for our pay-what-you-want pre-order on Bandcamp. If we turn out to have at least 42 people pre-order our album, as we're on track to do, that actually works out to $1,661 we theoretically left on the table, because those people would have potentially purchased a reward package at a higher dollar amount had they taken part in the crowdfunding campaign.
There's another, less obvious but very important reason to go with Pledge Music, and this applies to both small acts like mine, and the more widely known acts that seem to be Pledge's bread and butter. It has to do with a very smart decision they made: The amount of money you're trying to raise is never displayed in dollar amount. Users see what percentage of the goal was reached so far.
There's this sort of inherent fear in setting your Kickstarter goal because the penalty of not reaching it is total failure. Since you also have to be 100% transparent on the amount, you're compelled to set as low a number as you can get away with so your fan's don't think you're overreaching. For example, we set our goal lower than we wanted to be safe and ended up unable to afford to hire a PR agent as we had originally planned. And there were still cost overruns in many of the rewards, some of which we'd planned for, some of which we hadn't. On a larger scale this could have been disaster and is a fairly common complaint with Kickstarter. (Indiegogo is even more prone to this, because it rewards projects that fail to reach their goal, but takes a higher cut.)
Not only does Pledge Music have the expertise to help you avoid these problems, but their attitude is much more conducive to success: “Set the budget you need to do what you need to do, and you will get there eventually, just keep at it”. On Pledge, our band would have set our original budgeted goal of $6,000. We cut it down to $3,666 because that was our educated guess on how much we could realistically raise in 60 days, and we weren't too far off. But it felt like the final round in the Price is Right.
Would it have taken longer than 60 days? Yes. Was there something about the deadline and the consequences that drove us and our fans to reach our goal? Yes. Obviously, it's a big reason Kickstarter chooses to take its approach.
But here's what it really boils down to: Behind every successful album on any platform — be it digital crowdfunding or just selling CDs out of the back of a car — is a successful manager. Kickstarter works because its platform that has features that enable the average artist to self-manage, whereas Pledge Music is built more as a tool that their campaign managers, along with the artist's management, can use to engage the fans of the artist they represent.
You can read the case study on how our crowdfunding campaign succeeded, but basically, it was proper management and passionate promotion. I'm sure Pledge Music's campaign managers can corroborate the amount of time and effort it takes to keep fans engaged is not to be underestimated. If I were scaling the crowdfunding campaign into five or six figures like most artists on Pledge Music, outsourcing management would quickly become mandatory.
The big lesson we've learned from watching projects fail on Kickstarter is that over-promising and under-delivering is a major risk. I'm reminded of many stories of indie bands that unexpectedly sold out of records or CDs and didn't have the liquidity or production resources to keep the supply of recordings moving to fans. This is just a 21st century version of that problem.
So how to we convince musicians to embrace crowdfunding as the status quo for making albums? Education is a big part of it. With this blog and my online course, I've been doing everything I can to spread the word.
Ultimately, musicians will have to run the “experiment” themselves to see that it's the most equitable financing solution for both musician and fan, potentially more lucrative than any record real if managed correctly, and much more rewarding from a basic human and artistic standpoint.
It will take companies like Pledge Music to convince musicians and their managers that crowdfunding is where music is headed. They're going to need to better differentiate themselves from the Kickstarters and Indiegogos that dominate the market, while offering a user experience that is engaging for both fans and musicians. These are the areas that Pledge Music is weakest in. It's not really standing out from the crowd in a marketing sense, and much of that has to do with a user experience that fails to be as innovating as the ideas behind it. Competing with Kickstarter is no small task, but I think Pledge Music has the potential to carve its own lucrative niche in the direct-to-fan artist revenue stream with the right leadership.
ANN ARBOR, MI - A man is under arrest after an incident at his Ann Arbor home had police there for several hours on Wednesday, Sept. 14. Police were called shortly before midnight on Sept. 13 to the
for a report of a neighbor dispute. The complaint said an intoxicated man had pointed a gun at a woman, said Ann Arbor police Detective Lt. Matthew Lige. "It is alleged that the subject confronted the caller with the weapon due to the headlight shining into the residence," Lige said. Police were unable to contact the man once they arrived on scene, but believed he was inside with a woman and child, Lige said. Washtenaw Metro SWAT and Washtenaw's Crisis Negotiation Team responded and, after several hours, were able to get ahold of the man, Lige said. He surrendered without incident. Policed located two weapons, and found the man's girlfriend and child unharmed inside the residence. "We are grateful that this incident was resolved without injury to any of the involved parties," Lige said. Overall, police remained on scene for more than five hours. The man was arrested for felonious assault and taken to the Washtenaw County Jail. He is expected to be arraigned on Thursday.
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will not “pour money into a bottomless pit” and patience with Greece is growing thin ahead of a new election in the Mediterranean country, a conservative member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet was quoted on Saturday as saying.
Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told the Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper that Germany, Europe's largest economy and the biggest contributor to rescue efforts, is glad to help Greece help itself but expects it to honor its agreements.
“We're not willing to pour money into a bottomless pit,” he told the newspaper.
“Anyone who wants to see help and solidarity from us has to accept that we expect from that country a certain amount of seriousness and a certain amount of reasonableness.”
Friedrich, who has long been a hardliner in Merkel's cabinet on Greece, became the first German minister in February to openly call for the country to leave the euro zone.
While his latest comments appear to be aimed at placating Germans who are increasingly anxious about the Greek situation, they are likely to reopen old wounds with Athens.
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble also called Greece “a bottomless pit” in February but after being villanized in Athens has since refrained from using the term.
Greece was forced to call a repeat election for June 17 after a May 6 vote left parliament divided between parties that support and oppose austerity conditions attached to a 130-billion-euro ($163 billion) bailout package agreed with the European Union and International Monetary Fund in March.
Anti-bailout parties are expected to repeat their strong performance, opinion polls show, increasing the risk Greece will renege on its austerity pledges, default on its debt and possibly leave the single currency.
Merkel and European Union leaders said at a summit this week they want to keep Greece in the euro zone. But sources told Reuters the Eurogroup Working Group - experts who work for the bloc's finance ministers - had told member states to begin making contingency plans for a Greece exit.
“FAILED STATE”
Juergen Fitschen, the designated co-chief executive of Germany's largest commercial bank, Deutsche Bank, was quoted in online editions of German newspapers on Friday calling Greece a “failed state”.
“Greece is the only country that we can in my view call a failed state,” he said. “It's a corrupt state, its political leadership is corrupt.”
Friedrich, a leader in the arch-conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) that is the Bavarian sister party to Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), said Greece made a mistake assuming joining the euro would give the country prosperity.
“(They) evidently believed wealth would be automatic if they got their hands on the euro,” Friedrich said.
He added “a country needs a currency that matches its economic strength.”
Public opinion in Germany is turning against Greece staying in the euro zone. A Politbarometer poll by ZDF TV published on Friday showed only 31 percent want Greece to stay with 60 percent opposed. In a similar ZDF poll in November, 41 percent wanted Greece to stay and 49 percent wanted to see it leave.
Germany's Nobel literature laureate Guenter Grass attacked Europe for its treatment of Greece in a poem published on Saturday in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper called “Europe's Disgrace”.
Greece was being disparaged as a country “below junk value”, he wrote, and added it was “close to chaos because you're not fit for the markets”.
He said Greece was being “abandoned as a naked debtor in the dock, a country suffers ... and is condemned to poverty.”
On a recent visit to a household product manufacturing plant in California we were awestruck at the miles of machinery humming away on lonely factory floors. Only 75 employees in total were needed to keep this enormous 300,000 square foot facility running 24/7.
It looked like machines rule the day. However on closer examination, we noted that it is the employees – each with an average of 15 years' experience – who are tapped to perform mission critical tasks that greatly impact the factory's performance. Tasks like reconfiguring production processes, immediate interventions to address process breakdowns, inspections and troubleshooting issues.
In an era when robots are hitting their stride, humans are still very much necessary.
This is not to say that algorithms, machines and robots won't replace many existing industrial work activities. According to an article from McKinsey, 59% of all manufacturing activities could be automated. However, humans will still be needed to perform the remaining 41% of activities.
The real world of manufacturing is full of situations that have little structure, predictability or definition. In aerospace manufacturing, almost every aircraft is made to specifications unique to that order –a process that requires extensive engineering attention from human workers. We also easily forget just how often things go wrong — an engine part is delayed because of an unexpected raw material shortage, or the cable wires are too short. These one-time, unpredictable situations can be costly and solving them requires human involvement because unstructured and undefined processes like issues management is hard to automate.
It is a fallacy to think that industrial robots, AI and machines will eliminate the need for industrial workers. By placing too much credence on this fantasy we risk neglecting our most important resource: human potential.
—Yan-David Erlich
Additionally, parts of industrial work will always involve navigating difficult terrain, delicately manipulating heavy tools, and decision-making when there isn't enough data or information. These situations require the dexterity, mental agility and creative problem-solving abilities of humans.
Automation also places higher importance on non-routine aspects of human work. According to research by Sabine Pfeiffer of the Department of Sociology at the University of Hohenheim in Germany, automation increases the complexity and vulnerability of an overall system as smaller and seemingly insignificant events can affect the whole organization on a bigger scale. In her research at a highly automated car body production plant, Pfeiffer found as many as 20 to 30 human interventions per shift were needed to prevent major flaws in quality and productivity.
In more affluent societies, manufacturing is also becoming an increasingly complex undertaking. Wealthier consumers are demanding an even broader assortment of goods and services. As a result businesses that create these offerings have to reconfigure manufacturing lines and processes continuously. These mass customization scenarios create more complexity in the production processes and new machinery that need more human-driven setup, maintenance and repair.
As automation spreads and robots take over the mundane aspects of manufacturing, there is also an opportunity for industrial workers to spend more of their workday tackling higher value-added tasks. These are critical tasks that robots and AI cannot easily replicate like breakthrough product innovations and efforts to enhance customer satisfaction that can give an organization a leg up over the competition.
To fully tap the potential of Industry 4.0, companies must invest in technology tools, training and processes that can augment and support their industrial workforce as they perform qualitatively more important work. Industrial workers must have the ability to collaborate in real-time, benefit from immediate access to best practices, and have clearer work instructions and operating procedures. In the same way that desk-bound workers have a plethora of productivity, collaborative, project management and workflow technology tools to choose from, so too should the desk-less industrial workforce.
Companies must also invest in training to build new skill sets among their high performing workers. In order to succeed in an Industry 4.0 world, industrial workers will need both job specific knowledge and digital skills like creating spreadsheets, working with new technology interfaces and even programming.
It is a fallacy to think that industrial robots, AI and machines will eliminate the need for industrial workers. By placing too much credence on this fantasy we risk neglecting our most important resource: human potential.
We also risk derailing our efforts at Industry 4.0. According to PWC's 2016 Global Industry 4.0 Survey, the biggest challenge to the successful transformation and execution of Industry 4.0 isn't the technology – it's the people. We are dependent upon the digital qualifications of the employees who we need to roll out digital processes and services, says the report.
I subscribe to a human-centric Industry 4.0. Here connected industrial workers, supported and augmented by technology, are equally crucial for success as advanced AI and industrial robotics. It is the man-machine collaboration that will ensure our factories reach new levels of efficiency, competitiveness, innovation, safety, and productivity.
The Catholic Church operates a private school in Macon, Georgia.
Flint Dollar was their band teacher. He is openly gay. The Catholic Church position is that being gay is not, in and of itself a sin. Rather, non-marital sex is a sin. Likewise, marriage is a sacrament in the Catholic Church — a bond between one man and one woman.
The Catholic Church does not approve of people teaching at Mount de Sales if they've violated the sacraments of the church. Teachers who get divorced are let go. Flint Dollar also wants to violate a sacrament of the church. He wants to get married to another man. The Church, as a result, dismissed him.
Now the Obama Administration is telling the Catholic Church it must treat gays and divorced heterosexuals differently Flint Dollar sued claiming he was not conforming to his gender because he wants to marry a guy. The EEOC says they're fine with that.
Pope Francis and the Catholic Church will be made to care — on the same day Georgia Republicans have said RFRA is not needed in Georgia.
Thousands of children face missing out on all their chosen primary schools next week amid a snowballing crisis over places.
Councils are struggling to cater for rising pupil numbers, fuelled by a baby boom and high immigration.
As a result more than 20,000 youngsters could be denied a place at all of the schools listed on their applications this year.
It will mean ‘significant numbers' forced to travel long distances to schools in other areas, experts have warned.

Many local authorities have had to create classrooms in disused buildings, build extensions to schools and add ‘bulge' classes to cope with the extra demand.
More than 600,000 children are set to receive their primary places for September on national offers day this Thursday.
Matt Richards, senior partner at consultants Schoolappeals.com, which helps families challenge admissions decisions, said he had already received calls from worried parents.
‘It's highly likely there will be a significant number of parents that won't have a place in any school this year, let alone a preferred school,' he said. ‘They will be told to travel very large distances – two or more miles – to areas where there is less demand. In a city like London, this could take over an hour and a half.'
Alan Smithers, professor of education at the University of Buckingham, said pupil numbers had been boosted by generous benefits, immigration and career women having children later in life. He added: ‘We have had unbridled immigration and many of the people who have arrived have had much larger families.'
Last year, almost 77,000 children failed to secure a place at their first choice primary school.
More than 22,400 missed out on all the primaries they applied to and were allocated an alternative on offers day, while 3,700 initially failed to get a state school place at all. Hundreds were still waiting last summer as councils scrambled to find extra places.

Local Government Association (LGA) projections suggest the pressure will be worse this year, saying that for the first time, one in five council areas in England will have more children ready to start school than available places.
It predicted London would be squeezed hardest, with the most oversubscribed borough of Harrow receiving 112 applications for every 100 places.
Earlier this year, Oxford University research found London had seen a significant increase in immigration over the last four years, with its migrant population rising 6 per cent from 2,998,000 in 2011 to 3,187,000 in 2014.
Outside London, Bristol, Leicester and Slough will also reach ‘tipping point', the LGA said. Last year, it predicted 130,000 extra primary places will be needed by 2017 – around 4,750 new classes or 500 schools.
Councils responding to a Daily Mail survey admitted having to bring in emergency measures this year. Those in Northumberland, York and Bolton had added extra classrooms, while Poole council in Dorset built a new school.
The highly selective trove of Hillary Clinton emails released by the State Department Friday revealed both the seemingly strong influence Sidney Blumenthal wielded over the secretary of state and the preoccupation with media coverage exhibited by her closest aides.
If the 296 published emails are to be considered a complete collection, they would suggest Clinton relied almost exclusively on an aide that had been banned from the State Department, Blumenthal, to provide her intelligence on a country at war.
The emails show that Clinton's staffers often circulated and debated press clippings amongst themselves and occasionally discussed how to respond to certain media criticisms.
They also provide a narrow glimpse of how the State Department's top ranks operated in the weeks before and after the greatest crisis of Clinton's tenure.
Clinton asked State Dept. aides to prepare speech for Clinton Foundation
An email dated Sept. 22, 2012 shows Clinton appeared to discuss a speech for the Clinton Global Initiative less than two weeks after the Benghazi attack.
Jake Sullivan, a top Clinton aide, sent Clinton a draft of the speech that day and encouraged her to "let me know your thoughts."
The entire speech is redacted under a FOIA exemption that allows agencies to hold back internal deliberations.
What is unclear is why Clinton was using State Department aides to prepare a speech for her family's foundation, or why the text of that draft would be considered an internal government communication.
The day of Benghazi attacks, Clinton asked for a film she made a cameo in
Hours before the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Clinton asked a pair of her top staffers to find her a copy of the Bernard Henri Levy documentary, "The Oath of Tobruk."
Levy had directed the film about the Libyan war, which featured a cameo from Clinton herself.
But elsewhere in the emails, Levy's name surfaced again, although it was redacted in the version released by the State Department.
In a memo to Clinton dated March 27, 2011, Blumenthal noted that French President Nicolas Sarkozy had asked Levy, a sociologist, to use his "long established ties to Israel, Syria, and other nations in the Middle East" to assess the level of influence al Qaeda and other terrorist groups wielded in the Libyan government.
'This will be exciting when it's FOIA'd'
A light-hearted exchange between Philippe Reines, Thomas Nides and Caroline Adler — all top Clinton aides — revealed the staffers had FOIA in mind when emailing with their government accounts.
Describing an interview Clinton gave to Wall Street Journal reporter Monica Langley in which the reporter sat too close to the secretary, Reines said he didn't "think you see that behavior among any type of mammal."
"Was like the dental hygienist rolling around the floor to get the best access to your mouth depending on what tooth she was trying to get access to," he wrote.
"I may go and throw up since I am laughing so hard," Nides said.
Adler, who was copied on the chain, added, "this will be exciting when it's FOIA'd."
Clinton confused names of slain Americans
In the hours after Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were murdered in a terrorist raid, Clinton sought advice from her aides about when to announce Stevens' death.
But critics quickly pounced on the fact that Clinton seemingly jumbled the ambassador's name with that of Sean Smith, a foreign service information management officer who was also killed in the attack, by referring to the slain diplomat as "Chris Smith" instead of Chris Stevens.
Blumenthal and Clinton had secret meeting just after Benghazi attack
Clinton appears to have visited Blumenthal just weeks after the Benghazi attack.
Blumenthal told his old friend it was " great to see you" on October 6, 2012, and encouraged her to "drop in again," the emails show.
A day later, he invited Bill and Hillary Clinton to his home after the election.
"Post-election, we'd like to have you over for dinner," Blumenthal wrote. "Bill can come too, if he's in town. Whatever works."
"Will do," she replied.
The exchange was yet another illustration of the close ties between the former Clinton aide and secretary of state that has sparked controversy in recent days.
Emails between Blumenthal and Clinton made up a significant portion of the records released Friday.
In 9 months leading up to Benghazi, there's only 35 Clinton emails
The State Department emails span most of Clinton's final two years in office, but the cache contains long stretches of time when either no emails were sent, or none were disclosed.
In the two weeks before the Benghazi attack, Clinton and her staff either did not send each other a single email regarding the atmosphere in Benghazi that led to the death of four Americans in a raid on the U.S. consulate there, or the emails during that time were not disclosed.
In the nine months of 2012 before the Sept. 11 attack, Clinton and her aides exchanged just 35 emails that the secretary of state evidently deemed fit to give the State Department.
Private server emails contained sensitive data FBI classified just hours before release
The FBI classified information in one of Clinton's emails just hours before their release, the Associated Press reported Friday.
State Department officials told the AP Clinton's emails from Nov. 18, 2012, contained the names of suspects that had been arrested in Libya in connection with the attacks.
Twenty-three words were redacted from that particular email published on the State Department website.
Reporters pressed State Department spokesperson Marie Harf on why information sensitive enough to be considered classified, even retroactively, was handled on a private server.
"It's possible that the degree of sensitivity … evolved over time," Harf said at a briefing Friday.
State Dept. made political, helpful redactions
Leaked emails published by the New York Times just one day before the State Department officially released the email trove show that the agency redacted a number of passages before publishing the documents.
The State Department had redacted parts of emails that revealed officials' personal opinions about prominent Libyans.
The agency also removed some of Clinton's own words, such as her suggestion to explore arming the Libyan rebels using "private security experts."
Clinton's attempt to warn the White House to prepare for Republican attacks on the Obama campaign using Benghazi as fodder was also redacted, although it is unclear how that information would affect national security.
First, a hand goes up in front of the camera. Then two. Then a jacket is held up to screen the shot. A woman is heard saying “block him.”
As Dennis Gilman, a Phoenix-area independent videographer continues to record, several people surround him at the Are America Tour and Rally at the Arizona state capitol. They know him. One portly bearded fellow walks up to him to say “We got a permit. You gotta stay on the sidewalk and that's it. Move.”
A couple of minutes later, as one man is saying “hey (epithet), get the (epithet) out of here,” even as the speaker is saying that he has the right to be there, he's pushed out of the park while many in the crowd yell at him.
This, to Barb Heller, an organizer of the rally, is a request to leave that was “nicely done.”
Gilman is no stranger to covering anti-immigration rallies, or neo-Nazi demonstrations, or other controversial groups in Arizona. In a profile of the activist and writer by the Phoenix New Times, Gilman said it's common for him to be threatened with physical violence, with a Tea Party activist once poking him with a sign that read, “Dennis Gilman is a Pimp.”
Heller, an anti-immigration activist in Phoenix and strong supporter of Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, described Gilman in an exclusive interview with Raw Story as a provocateur. “They entice riots,” she said of Gilman and another reporter, Stephen Lemons from the Phoenix New Times. “They're not like regular reporters. They don't have an ounce of class. … I don't consider the New Times ‘media.'”
Heller, who had not yet seen the video when speaking to Raw Story, accused Gilman of using deceptive editing and deliberate provocation in the past, in order to get dramatic video. And she said that the anti-immigration activists had the right to remove Gilman.
“We jumped through all of the hoops,” she said. “We did this venue strictly wanting it at the capitol so that we would be protected, that we could have the right to tell people to leave or tell people from the word go that they were not welcome. It was nicely done, and he immediately started swinging around and knocking a few people down, from what I understand. When he was asked to please move to the sidewalk, we didn't make him leave entirely, but we could make him leave the area we had reserved, which was the Senate lawn.”
Gilman can be heard on the video asking the anti-immigration activists to find a police officer if they insist that he be removed. Asked why they did not, Heller replied, “We are required by the permit to have our own internal security. That was our internal security.”
Riders United for a Sovereign America — an anti-immigration biker group — sponsored the event, along with the Remember 1986 Coalition and the Black American Leadership Alliance.

I have always loved basketball, especially the NBA. And I always preferred General Manager sports games over games where I had to play the sport. But the truth is I never understood how NBA games worked, I basically selected the team and sent it to the court hoping I could get that W at the end of the game. Besides NBA 2K, I didn't know any GM game for the NBA. And then I got hooked when I found Basketball GM. I still don't really know everything I should be doing in the game but I really enjoy playing it. You can play the game on your browser, for free, and I guarantee you'll have a great time.
Recently I've decided to play the game over the course of 100 seasons and post the results here. This will be like a review of the game where I hope I can learn a few things about the NBA.
My Goal
Win 15 NBA Titles
Make it to the NBA Finals 20 times
Make it to the Conference Finals 30 times
Make it to the Conference Semi-Finals 50 times
Make it to the NBA Playoffs 70 times
I don't know if these are hard goals or pretty simple and easy. I have played the game in the past and I think I'll have some trouble achieving them. We'll see.
I'll be using a League File I found on Reddit so I can use the correct rosters.
Year 1
The team selection page is pretty simple and easy to use. I have decided to start my journey with the NBA team with the worst record this season: Philadelphia 76ers. I don't expect to achieve much this first year, maybe try a few trades and, depending on how the season is going, I should try to tank so I can get a high draft pick.
This is a pretty young team with good potential. That 100-day-injury on Joel Embiid scared me a little bit but I know this is going to be a rough year. My payroll is really low and I'll try to trade Carl Landry to clear my payroll even more. I think I'll be able to secure good players in next year's offseason.
Standings
Well… it wasn't pretty. It was a really bad season as I expected. Still managed to get a better record and a better place than the real life 76ers team.
One thing I really love about this game is its speed. I was able to simulate the entire regular season in just 2 minutes. There's probably a lot of stuff I can do (and probably should have done it) during the regular season, I just don't know what. And to have the opportunity to just skip the year and all those things, to me, that's a huge plus. I love games where I can advance quickly in time. I love when I have the ability to choose my own speed. If I feel like taking my time and do everything right I can do it, but it feels great to just take that leap in time and go to where we want to go.
Golden State Warriors won this year's NBA Finals. No surprise there. But they won it against the Milwaukee Bucks (!!!)
As for my goals, I couldn't achieve any of them. Maybe next season.
Year 2
This was my first draft and I had the 4th, 26th and 28th pick. Of course I wanted that Ben Simmons but I couldn't get him. I got Brandon Ingram which I think will become a good player.
This is where it starts to get tricky. Like I mentioned before, I don't fully understand everything I should be doing so I gambled a little in the offseason. I traded a few players to make room for a few players. I have a ton of 1st and 2nd round picks. I'll hold on to those first round picks but I'll try something in return of the rest. In free agency I was able to get Damian Lillard. I'm not sure about that contract, probably a mistake but I desperately needed a good Guard and he was the best (by far) available. I couldn't resist and got Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan and Joe Johnson on board. The last player I got was Ryan Anderson which I think will help the team. I'm not sure about what this roster can do but I really want to make it to the playoffs this season. Let's simulate this F-ing year!
Standings
If I was a gambling man (which I am), I'd bet I did something right on the offseason. I secretly believed I was going to make the playoffs, but the number 1 seed was never on my mind. That adds some pressure going to the playoffs
Playoffs
If you ask me, there's no good way to lose. But this truly is the worst way to go out. I lost that NBA Finals game 7. I really thought I was going to make it. I could smell that ring coming. And now I feel bad for Tim Duncan for making him go throught that experience again. In his last year as a player.
My Goals (so far)
Win 15 NBA Titles – 0/2
Make it to the NBA Finals 20 times – 1/2
Make it to the Conference Finals 30 times – 1/2
Make it to the Conference Semi-Finals 50 times – 1/2
Make it to the NBA Playoffs 70 times – 1/2
Year 3
For this year I used the same strategy as the previous season. I was so close last time and I had high hopes about this one.
It was a really easy regular season and I improved the record from the past year (63-19). Made some adjustments going to the playoffs and I was feeling very confident. I had a young team but they showed me what they could do. And this happened…
At the third year I got my first ring! Damian Lillard had an amazing season winning the MVP and Finals MVP. I guess I did the right thing giving him that contract and bringing him to Philly. Now let's hope I can keep most of my team and maybe win it all again in the future.
Year 4
Another year, another record improvement (68-14). I was loving my team. They did everything I wanted them to do and all I could see was that 2nd ring coming. I made it to the NBA Finals again (3rd season in a row) but I lost to the LA Lakers (4-0). I'll continue with the same strategy since it has brought me success so far.
Year 5
This season's draft gave me a great surprise. I got the first pick in the draft thanks to the Sacramento Kings.
This year's payroll is through the roof. I have 3 players with 20 million contracts and I feel like I should trade at least one of them. Probably Okafor or Embiid as they are both centers.
This team just keeps improving every year (71-11). I hoped this would be the year I got my 2nd ring and be the first team to win it for the 2nd time since I started this game. The playoffs came and it was probably the easiest run I had. I faced the Portland Trailblazers and swept the Finals with a 4-0 win.
I don't know how it's going to be in the future, I will trade a few key players to clear my payroll a little.
Year 6
Looking at my team now and comparing it to the one I had last year I can see it is a weaker team. I'm pretty sure we'll make it to the playoffs but I don't see us winning the title this time.
The record from this season shows that we're not as strong as we were (59-23) but I still think we're a great team and have a word to say in the Eastern Conference. Let the Playoffs begin!
What can I say? Incredible what this team has done. Another ring (2nd in a row). Unbelievable playoff run that ended on game 7. This time we won it. Can't wait to start the next season.
Year 7
I have to admit I didn't have my best offseason. I traded poorly and while I hope to get to the playoffs, deep down I know the NBA title is looking like a dream that won't come true. I traded Damian Lillard who has been my best player but was clearly declining in terms of Overall and Potential.
Not a great regular season (53-31). I finished in 4th and I wasn't happy. I still made it to the playoffs but the last 5 years had been golden and I wasn't ready to see my team go down the standings. Not many expectations going into the postseason.
There was a time during the playoffs where I believed I could win the title. I got to the Conference Final and lost to the Toronto Raptors (4-3). Then they lost to the LA Lakers in the Finals. Well, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. I'm starting to feel like my time in Philly is coming to an end, I really want to try managing another franchise. We'll see what happens.
Year 8
I think the time has come for a little rebuilding. I don't think this roster has what it takes to win a championship so I'll try to make good trades and secure some high draft picks so I can start a new dynasty in the NBA. We'll see what happens.
There's not much to say. Poor record (36-46) and out of the Playoffs. LA Clippers won their first title.
Year 9
I'm going to hold on to my best player (Patrick Greenbaum/26yo) and tank for another season. I'll clear as much payroll as I can so I can return stronger next year. Tough times we face.
17-65. Embarrassing. Hopefully this will be the last time I'll do so bad. Houston Rockets won the League.
Year 10
Number 4 pick. I was hoping for a better pick but my payroll is small so I expect to have a team ready to fight for the ring this year. See you in the regular season.
This is the roster I'll have for my 10th season. We'll see where they can take me.
I'm not disappointed, but I'm not happy either. I obviously improved this season but I wanted more (51-31). Finished in the 4th position and can't really know how the Playoffs will be. My goal is to get to the Conference Semi-finals, at least.
I got what I wished for. I got to the Conference Semi-finals, but it felt bad to go out after having a 3-1 lead over the Miami Heat. Toronto Raptors are this year's winners.
After 10 seasons, these are the teams with championships won. I managed to win 3 times with the Philadelphia 76ers putting them at the top of the list.
Year 11
Slightly better team, higher expectations. I want to get back to the right track and I need to do it fast. Last time I won a championship was 5 years ago and I want to get back to the race.
I was happy with my regular season (58-24). I know my roster isn't as good as my golden years team and I think we did well, finishing in the 2nd position. This year's goal is the Conference Finals.
Two extremely hard rounds, both won on game 7 (1st round: Knicks/Conference Semis: Pistons) showed how unprepared my team was. I lost to the Washington Wizards in the next round, and they ended up winning the title.
The owner of the franchise is still happy with the job I'm doing. But I can't say the same for myself. I honestly expected more. I think the problem was me. I should have done everything I could to keep my team from the first years.
Year 12
I like the roster I put together for this season. This year we will likely be on the top of the standings.
With a record of 63-19, my team managed to secure the number 1 seed on the Eastern Conference. If we can avoid the injuries we have had in the past, I think we are the main contenders to win it all.
And we did it! We are back at the top of the League. Our 4th ring.
Our team is young and I'll try to hold on to the most important players this time. The obvious goal for the next season is to do it all over again.
Year 13
Another risky decision. I changed nothing from last year. I dropped one player and brought a rookie from the draft. Hope it's not another failed test.
Same team from last year, similar regular season (62-20). Let's hope they give me a similar postseason.
In the 1st round I had to go to game 7 to defeat the Detroit Pistons. I was very lucky, so I wasn't expecting what happened next. I won the Conference Semi-finals (Milwaukee Bucks), Conference Finals (New York Knicks) and NBA Finals (Golden State Warriors) with the same result: 4-0! After 13 years I have the same number of rings as Kobe Bryant, who was once a player on my roster.
Year 14
For this year I'll keep using the same strategy, only letting a few players leave and replace them with better ones and cheaper. I want to win three championships in a row for the first time. I still believe in this team.
I'm enjoying this new formula. Three teams with the same core and very similar records, this one equals to the last one (62-20). Does that mean…?
Yep! Another championship. This time, in all rounds, I lost just 1 game, in the 1st round. Then win after win, I end up beating the Clippers in the Finals. I guess I found the best strategy. But there's one problem… the players are getting older.
Year 15
Last season of this Part I. And I want to go out with a bang. I had to make a few adjustments to my roster, but the core is still there. And the team keeps getting better with a memorable record (68-14). I know we're favourites to win the championship but I see a lot of my guys getting injured which quite frankly scares me.
A NBA Final that went all the way to game 7, and we won it…again! 4 championships in a row! This is the best strategy I used over the first 15 seasons. I don't have the best team in the league, but I have a deep bench with quality players.
Here is the history of the league in the last 15 seasons. My 7-championships are impressive but I was more impressed with what Andrew Wiggins was able to achieve: 11 MVP awards (9 straight)!!! I'm the best franchise so far, there's no doubt about it. Will I be able to keep this trend in the next years? What would you change in the way I play this game? Tell me about your records and achievements on the comments below.
My Goals (so far)
Win 15 NBA Titles – 7/15
Make it to the NBA Finals 20 times – 9/15
Make it to the Confenrence Finals 30 times – 11/15
Make it to the Conference Semi-Finals 50 times – 12/15
Make it to the NBA Playoffs 70 times – 12/15

Former "Bachelorette" star JoJo Fletcher. ABC
In the world of reality dating shows, talking about your past relationships and sex life is par for the course, but few would think that extended to the show's producers.
Yet that's exactly what a former segment producer for "The Bachelor" claims happened to her in a new complaint against Warner Bros., which produces the show.
Becky Steenhoek — who worked on the production for the 2016 season of "The Bachelorette" with JoJo Fletcher— filed a lawsuit on Monday in the Los Angeles Superior Court and spoke with the Los Angeles Times about what occurred between her and five other producers, who were also named along with Warner Bros. in the complaint.
Steenhoek, 31, says that the show's executive and cast producers named in the complaint would ask her personal questions that were extremely sexual in nature, including about her personal grooming habits, sex life, and masturbation.
"You could visibly tell it was very uncomfortable to me to witness, just because they did make comments like, 'Oh, Becky's blushing,' or 'Her ears are probably burning,'" Steenhoek told The Times, adding that her colleagues' questions made her uncomfortable.
When she asked her female coworker Caitlin Stapleton — a cast producer on the show — what to do about it, Steenhoek said Stapleton told her that was just "the way of the industry and world that we work in," adding that the behavior was "locker-room talk" and a way to bond.
Steenhoek said after confiding in Stapleton, her job markedly changed from attending production meetings to fetching meals for her bosses before being told she wasn't needed for the remainder of the season. When she asked why, she said she was told it was because she wasn't enough of a "bitch."
Steenhoek was a producer on Fletcher's season of "The Bachelorette." ABC
Steenhoek is now suing Warner Bros., "Bachelor" creator Mike Fleiss' production company NZK Productions, as well as producers Elan Gale, Peter Scalettar, Jacqueline Naz Perez, Bennett Graebner, and Stapleton for "damages related to sexual harassment and hostile work environment, sex discrimination, retaliation, failure to prevent harassment, intentional infliction of emotional distress and wrongful termination," according to the LA Times.
In a statement to INSIDER, Warner Bros. said it had previously investigated Steenhoek's claims and didn't feel their findings supported her claims. Read the full statement below:
"We take all allegations of workplace harassment very seriously. These allegations were brought to our attention and were thoroughly investigated earlier this year. Our findings did not support the plaintiff's characterization of the events claimed to have taken place, which is why we are disappointed by the filing of this lawsuit."
Steenhoek's lawsuit comes at a time when powerful industry players in Hollywood like producer Harvey Weinstein or director James Toback are being accused of sexual harassment. And it's not just in Hollywood — many powerful men are now being accused of sexual misconduct, including Ben Affleck and Kevin Spacey.
Alright first off....this is probably the closest so far I actually have gotten to getting a comic near the episode exactly this season.It's funny cause this comic I was scrambling to get done a few weeks ago before the early release. I got this comic done just a few days before the actual episode aired back in mid-May and it's kind of funny how close I got to the episode with this being done before the episode aired. I never bothered to change this comic even after the episode and stuff or make a new one cause....why? It's more fun like this and also...I don't want to do another comic if I don't have to. That's just wasting time. So in a sense this comic has been sitting on my computer finished like the episode 11 one for a little bit considering I only release these comics per the U.S. release schedule for the episodes. Give me time to work on them. Muffin is in this.By the way I did check and it's been a WHILE since I did anything of normal Luna. Granted the Wereluna stuff doesn't exactly count but I think it's just about been over a year since I did anything with normal Luna in a comic or anything like that....again besides Wereluna stuff.I did slightly tweak my stuff just a little bit in this comic as you can see just a bit, hence why Luna looks a little different than my usual style.I am playing around with a style adjustment for a little bit and I am testing to see if this can work....you may have noticed it when I did the last comic with the Rarity and Applejack one. It's not so much the lineart but the way the ponies look. It's suttle but I wanna see if this works. I guess it's a tick realistic cartoon style I am throwing in on certain sections but I am trying to play around with it. I am gonna play around with thisfor a little bit going forward...some poses and stuff I am noticing so far as I am working on my episode 14 and 15 comics right now it's working well and other stuff I can't put that style in. It's just where I feel like it. Back to this comic though it is kind of weird in a way how much annoyance I was getting with the far mountain BGs. I personally don't think I ever made a BG like that on a Canterlot balcony...to this extent of a balcony. I do believe I was checking in the episode for at lease some type of reference starting point what a balcony in canterlot looks like...I mean to something like this one and the only one that I found is the one at the end of Magical Mystery Cure...problem is there's nothing for me to work with.So this was pretty much totally winged up.Ok I talk to much. Enjoy this comic cause the next one for EP 11 has been done again since Mid-May when I was trying to get these out as fast as possible before when I thought the EPs would catch up with me. Luckily...mid-season break happened...yay.So there ya go...onward to the next comic and boy right now I am really getting ahead on the episode comics right now...could finish the entire season of S7 comics before the mid-season returns.

Description: (Michael Grasso and J.E. Anckorn)
GRASSO: On August 28, 2017, The Ship restaurant in Lynnfield, Massachusetts was torn down. By itself, not much of an event, but taken in combination with the last decade and a half of kitschy, midcentury landmarks being closed, displaced, and demolished on the North Shore of Boston's famous Route 1, this is the erasure of a very special place and time that hits awfully close to home for me. Growing up, Route 1 between Revere and Danvers, Massachusetts was a wonderland of midcentury signage and architecture, running the gamut from the 50-foot-tall cactus at the Hilltop Steak House to the iconic Orange Dinosaur at the Route 1 Mini Golf & Batting Cages to countless motels sporting signage from the classic '50s/'60s era of motel styling. Now, all these institutions are gone, knocked down or taken over in the name of strip malls, shopping plazas, and luxury condos. While all this history is very personal to me, Jenny, these buildings are something of a foreign phenomenon for you, correct?
ANCKORN: The eye of the alien interloper in any culture is drawn to similarly alien things: things that people who have grown up alongside them may no longer see as unusual. “Sure, the twenty-foot tall bright orange dinosaur has always glowered menacingly over Route 1, like some pagan idol weighing the souls of motorists on their way to grab a bag of piping hot calories at McDonald's. What's so odd about that?”
He was just odd enough to get a passing callout in Stephen King's Cell (2006). He was beloved enough that people mourned as the golf course he ruled over was pulled down and his grimace looked increasingly frightened rather than frightening—but no city council stepped in to save him. Where I'm from (the UK), destroying historical properties is taken incredibly seriously, but the golf course was plowed flat with barely a whisper. Perhaps it's hard to imagine an object that fit into its environment with such authority being under threat until it's actually gone. And the dinosaur is one of the lucky ones. He'll stand alone, Ozymandias-style, in front of the aggressively bland shopping/apartment complex that is going up where the miniature golf course once stood. Nothing alien about that: the world doesn't really want for square boxes containing other square boxes.
It was the orange dinosaur who was my first capital-A Americana Route 1 crush; perhaps a dinosaur is appropriate symbolically for the other strange and unusual monuments of a dying culture?
GRASSO: To loop back onto the Route 1 Mini Golf course, it opened in 1958 at the height of pre-fab mini golf mania. The popular obstacles that we all know and love from this period—windmills, water wheels, lighthouses—all trace their roots back to a pair of brothers from upstate New York: Bob and Joe Taylor. In the years after World War II, they founded a company to equip the kinds of courses that postwar nuclear families in America could visit either close to home or while on vacation. Route 1's position on the North Shore of Boston made it, even before the creation of the Eisenhower Interstate Highway System, the fastest automobile thoroughfare to the vacationlands of New Hampshire and Maine (a legend that highway signage elsewhere in Massachusetts preserves to this day). What better way to spend a weekend away than starting off or finishing up with a round of mini-golf! In the '70s and '80s, the course added batting cages and eventually a small arcade to keep attractions up-to-date for the younger generation, but the golf course was always my favorite.
And where might you go to dinner after a hard day's putting? Well, perhaps the Hilltop Steak House. Founded in 1961 at the height of yet another postwar middle-American trend—the classic American steak house, a postwar reaction to the enforced deprivation of wartime rationing—Hilltop provided affordable steak dinners on a massive scale. Filled with Western-themed banquet rooms named after the dusty frontier towns seen and heard on Baby Boomer-era Western TV series and movies—Carson City, Dodge City, Sioux City—the paging system at Hilltop was a literal cattle call; you'd be announced by number and dining room over the loud, staticky PA.
ANCKORN: One of the things that cheered me up immensely my first Christmas away from my family in the UK was seeing the Hilltop's famous cows decked out in their Santa hats. You point out that the scale was massive, and yet when it's one guy's vision—in this case Frank Giuffrida's—it retains the human touch that corporations these days are desperate to associate themselves with or cling on to. Kitsch is human. Like its big sister camp, it ironically can't be artificially inseminated into anyone's marketing scheme. I don't want to get all “in a world” here, and yet, in a world where most chain store seasonal decor comes branded in corporate colors and with a strict guide specifying exactly how each individual bauble is to be displayed, there's something very human about a herd of fiberglass cows in awkwardly drooping Santa hats.
It's where the inhumanity creeps in that places like this fail. After Frank passes on to the great faux rodeo (fauxdeo?) in the sky, less money gets spent on food, quality goes down, the love is gone, profit is all, and people can sense that. If you subtract the human touch, what's to prevent the next generation of suburbanites opting for the familiar safety of a Burger King? It's a corny sentiment, but a restaurant topped by a giant neon cactus being, in its day, the busiest in the US proves that corny sentiment is something people want. Or used to want.
Perhaps we blame marketing. The personal touch in 2017 is an executive chef who “creates plates” for hipsters in 8-seater restaurants downtown. Blue-collar suburbanites are expected to be grateful for the highway chains that encircle their bedroom communities like a wall, not pine for some butcher with a penchant for plastic bovines.
Or do we point at dropping pride and quality in favor of wringing every scrap of profit from a business, or do you shrug your shoulders and say, “Maybe they weren't all that great to begin with?”
I mean it's not like The Ship had its own branded salad dressing. Did you ever eat there?
GRASSO: No, I didn't. The Ship, sadly, didn't have as good or reliable a reputation for quality eats as Hilltop did. But The Ship is only the tip of the proverbial iceberg when it comes to “restaurants that look like stuff” on Route 1. (I have to mention briefly the longstanding 20th century trend of “landmarks/buildings that look like stuff,” especially popular as roadside attractions in the US and, surprisingly, Australia! One could argue that this impulse of purely decorative and aesthetically whimsical architecture goes all the way back to the “follies” of 18th-century Britain. But I digress.)
So let's see, there's the Prince Pizzeria with its “Leaning Tower of Pizza” (1961), the Route 1 Chinese temple-inspired boondoggle Weylu's Restaurant (opened in 1989, closed a decade later). But probably biggest, most impressive, and most successful of them all is the midcentury Tiki shrine, the Kowloon Restaurant (1958). The Kowloon is a classic example of yet another postwar American trend, the Tiki bar/Chinese restaurant. GIs, sailors, and Marines returning from the Pacific theater in World War II powered this dining and drinking trend in the States. The Kowloon features much of its original decor: an entire wall covered in Polynesian island seascape (complete with full-motion erupting volcanoes; this was my favorite place to sit as a kid). It even still has its original outdoor signage and clock, and still does pretty good business. For now.
Speaking of midcentury signage, one desperately missed (and slightly sleazy) feature of Route 1 is all the motels. Most of these opened immediately before or after World War II—again, as a rest stop for travelers headed to and from New Hampshire and Maine. As the years went on, they became less family destinations and slightly more sordid (they were nicknamed “no-tell motels,” as I learned growing up in the '80s) but many of them had amazing Googie-inspired signage which was always a delight to drive by.
But you're right; I think there is a series of class and economic issues underlying the way Route 1 has changed over the years. As you say, a thoroughfare like Route 1 gets taken over by big box stores, fast food chains, and other deep-pocketed corporate enterprises that can price out the little guys. And all of a sudden, a time capsule that implicitly extols a certain kind of postwar American economic and social power looks just like everywhere else in America: a strip full of Walmarts, McDonald's, and Chipotles.
ANCKORN: The more I think on this the more I wonder if it isn't a marketing thing. You mention Australia as a haven of “stuff that looks like stuff.” Well, there you have another country with a lot of long empty highways, and businesses trying to eke a living along those highways need to draw people in. Perhaps in the early 20th century that meant something unexpected, but when you have a few huge corporations with their multitude of finger-tentacles in all of the pies, it makes sense to market the opposite way: you sell the consumer on the bland and familiar. The art of advertising comes not from wowing people, but soothing them. Bland familiarity makes for a compliant consumer base. They don't want to eat things on fire in a boat inside a Tiki lodge (which is the defining memory of my Kowloon's experience); they just want to sit in the same booth eating the same food they do back home. Maybe the seeds of roadside kitsch's destruction were already taking root in its midcentury heyday? The idea of the automat strongly appealed to forward-thinkers like Warhol, who was an expert in mass production and the comforts of boredom.
We're supposed to trust in the collective cultural iconography (some of which is still to be seen along Route 1 in its original format) to guide us to safe havens, and distrust the unfamiliar. Sure, it's shaped like a giant ship, but I heard of a friend of a guy's sister who got scurvy there. At least at Starbucks we know the coffee is reliably tepid and the muffins, although stale, won't kill us. And we can look at that weird orange dinosaur in front of the shiny new shopping center from our window seats.
Kind of ugly, isn't it? Someone should tear that thing down.
Updated 12.45pm - Busuttil leaves San Anton palace
President Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca met with Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and Opposition leader Simon Busuttil today and said she would "exercise those few powers" given to her in an attempt to resolve the ongoing political crisis.
The President first met with Dr Muscat shortly after 11am, before meeting Dr Busuttil at noon. Both meetings were held at the presidential palace in San Anton.
In a statement ahead of the two meetings, the President said she had been closely following political developments and was calling the two political leaders after consulting with her constitutional advisers.

"As I have already stated several times, the powers of the President of Malta are
constrained by the Constitution itself, and I will exercise those few powers given to me," she said.
"At this stage, I will not be making any further statements on the matter, to allow the independent institutions to do their work. Malta is a democracy and the law is to be observed by everyone.”
Dr Muscat's official car was seen leaving the palace at 11.30am, with Dr Busuttil seen exiting the palace gates shortly after 12.30pm. No comments were given to the press after the meetings.

In a tweet, Dr Busuttil said that he would use the meeting to "ask her to use her authority to resolve this crisis."
I have been called to meet @presidentMT Coleiro Preca this morning. I will ask her to use her authority to resolve this crisis. — Simon Busuttil (@SimonBusuttil) April 24, 2017
Dr Busuttil yesterday told a crowd of demonstrators gathered in Valletta to protest corruption that the President had the moral authority to ask Prime Minister Joseph Muscat to step aside in the wake of allegations linking his wife to Panama company Egrant.
"The President is known for her honesty and integrity and although she does not have the legal power to remove the Prime Minister, she had the moral authority to ask him to leave in the national interest," Dr Busuttil told the thousands of people gathered in Valletta for a protest against corruption organised by the Nationalist Party.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., speaks at her weekly news briefing Friday, May 9, 2014, in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)
(CNSNews.com) - House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) says the United States must look to Qatar, an ally of the terrorist group Hamas, for advice in resolving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
"And we have to confer with the Qataris, who have told me over and over again that Hamas is a humanitarian organization," she told CNN's "State of the Union" with Candy Crowley.
As CNSNews.com reported last week, Qatar is a strong supporter and funder of Hamas. Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal operates from Qatar, and has so far rejected ceasefire proposals put forward by Egypt and promoted by Secretary of State John Kerry.
The U.S government designated Hamas as a “foreign terrorist organization” in 1997. Its founding charter calls for Jews to be killed and says all Muslims are duty-bound to join a jihad to destroy Israel.
In an interview aired on CBS's "Face the Nation" Sunday, Hamas leader Meshaal said Hamas does not fight the Jews just because they are Jews. "We fight the occupiers," he said. Asked if he wants to recognize Israel as a Jewish state, Meshaal said "No."
"War is a deadly thing," Pelosi said on Sunday, speaking about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
"And I have many Palestinians who live in my district, and I am hearing them regularly about how their families are affected who live in the region. It's a terrible thing. But let me just say that any missile that comes from someplace has a return address. And if Israel is responding to that address, then that's a shame that the Palestinians are ...rumored to be using children and families as shields for their missiles."
Pelosi said the first thing to do is to "avoid conflict" that "Hamas initiated."
"[T]his has to be something where we try to have the two-state solution, that we have to support...(Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud) Abbas and his role as a leader there. We have to support Iron Dome to protect the Israelis from the missiles. We have to support the Palestinians and what they need. And we have to confer with the Qataris, who have told me over and over again that Hamas is a humanitarian organization, maybe they could use their influence to--"
Crowley interrupted her to ask: "The U.S. thinks they're a terrorist organization though, correct? Do you?"
Pelosi responded: "Mmm hmm."
Crowley said: "Yeah."
And Pelosi said: "And we've had that discussion."
'Obama's leadership has been strong'; Putin 'is insecure'
In that same interview with CNN, Pelosi defended President Barack Obama's "strong" leadership, dismissing a suggestion that Russian President Vladimir Putin considers him to be weak.
Compared with Cold War days, "It's a much more complicated situation now, and the president's leadership has been strong," Pelosi told Crowley, pointing to Obama's support for Israel's Iron Dome missile shield; his request for humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people; and his sanctions on Russia.
"Putin is going to do what Putin is going to do," she said. "Some of what we see comes from insecurity. Putin, for all of his -- is insecure about Russia's role in the world now."
Pelosi noted that the Obama administration was early in saying that the rockets used to shoot down a Malaysian airliner over Ukraine "had a provenance in Russia."
"So nobody is missing in action in all of this."
"And as far as Putin is concerned, he's a KGB guy who happens to be the president of Russia and he's going to do what he's going to do no matter who else is in charge any other place in the world. So, I would not judge his actions or his motivations by anything other than he is rooted in the KGB, insecure about Russia's diminished role in the world."

Why do kids do it? The teen creed is to rebel. My parents let us drink, smoke, go out etc, but pointed out the pluses and minuses of each, and it held no interest for me. Mind you, I had enough confidence to flirt with girls without a plastic bottle of cider. Seriously, the habit then continues in the mating game. There isn't actually that much violence and vandalism, you just settle down with the wrong person. Tim Meo
It appeared to me that the groups of teenagers depicted in the program were from a less economically affluent area of Exeter. In my opinion, this is the root of the problem; lack of respect and self-discipline through the often under funded state education system. natalee
im a teenager and i got a fake id and i dont see a problem with teens drinking we should be aloud to drink anyway but maybe not so much on the streets like. i havnt got a problem with it and its not you're getting drunk its us so i think you should leave us all do what we want. its our lives. Alex Age :17
I my self am an underage drinker. I started when I was 13 as a social drinker at friends parties and houses. at that point i was hitting the hard stuff but one time i drank my self stupid and had a very bad experience with vodka and I cant stand the smell of it, even though this is 3 years on and i am 17. At the moment me and my close friends prefer going to bars and clubs and having a few drinks. maybe a few JD & Cokes / Beers for me, my mates all stick to beer and the females in our group usually have a glass or two of white wine. i know some people who drink themselfs silly. I know of a few people my age who still go drinking out and about with a bottle of lambrini or some cheap immitation thinking theyre really cool when theyre just acting immature. i think one of the main reasons why underage drinking is a big issue is that its labeled as a "taboo" pretty much like cannabis i dont think that should be legalised as people will move on to more hardcore substances. in my opinion its chavs that are the main scurge of underage drinking and violence about a month ago i was waiting for a club to open and a few of the people ive met before in the club got chased by a drunk female chav trying to hit them with a bottle of wine all the time it was open and spilling down her arm, makes sense. I my self dress in fashionable clothes and listen to dance or alternative music but i dont walk around in big groups intimidating people that i dont like the look of unlike chavs who congregate outside the local 7 - 11. I think if the drinking age was lowered to 16 like tobbaco and isnt frowned upon and made a taboo subject that people wouldnt think that it is "cool" to drink alcohol. and bouncers shouldnt be there to refuse entry to people who look slightly underage they should be there to eject people who get out of hand or refuse entry to people who dont seem to be in the correct dress code like the other week i went to a club and the bouncers seemed fair to some guys infront of me they were about 20 wearing chav/fashionable clothes like smart casual, shirt shoes and some smart casual pants the bouncer basically said the way your dressed i dont think this is your kind of place try the club just up the road. fair enough if bouncers were there to do that. but i dont think they should refuse entry to someone like myself who is 17 and looks about that age and is about as harmful as a blunt spoon. I see the majority of these comments are from parents, my parents know i go to establishments drinking they dont mind aslong as i dont drink myself stupid. A valid point, I know where i stand with them basically i dont go anywhere unsafe i go with a few mates and i either go home for 12 or ring them around 11:30 explaining the plan if im either staying at a mate or going to a club and getting a taxi back. If you let your children know where they stand they should respect that and drink carefully. Sorry about my life story in the comments section but this is how i feel about the issue anon
if the government provided activities for 14 to 17 years olds to do, then they wouldn't have to resort to drinking. in fact under 18 clubs are worse than over 18 clubs, as more fights break out and kids experiment sexually Dan Bevan
After watching your brilliant piece on the Fake ID's available on the market, I took a breath of fresh air, I printed of over 100 from the net a while ago and was shocked just how many are available, and with the law allowing this to go on, It's proving to be a very diffulcult situation. Its about time someone, did something, and you have shown the problem under a spotlight. I work for sussex police and have been working really hard to tackle problems caused by underage drinking etc in my area. I have produced laminated signs of Acceptable ID's eg:citizen card, Prove it, Driving licence, Passport etc, which have been given to all off licenses and shops, which sell age restricted goods, also we patrol the 'Hot' Spots, which is normally bus shelters, train station platforms, carparks, and parks etc etc. And regulary seize alcohol and cigerettes, and have recently seized fake Id from youths caught buying it..uk Pamela Wiltshire
What shocked me, apart from the underage drinking, was the fact that there appeared to be no Police around. Surely the Police in Exeter must be aware of the problem - how can you have so many children in one place drinking so much. James
If an underage person wants to get alcohol, they will get it! The biggest challenge we have lies with adults/family/friends who are serving these young people. We all know when someone is underage. It's easy to tell. Shopkeepers are money driven and they will sell to underage persons just to make the money! We all know that! Henk P Harton
The law should swiftly be changed by banning the selling of these fake IDs and the "company" be put to trial. Since and only since the first of January 2005 every citizen in the Netherlands is obliged to carry an ID, passport or driver's licence to identify him/herself when asked. A € 50.00 penalty if not; Belgium has had this system for dozens of years, so Whitehall hurry up!!! Go on with your perfect programs, we enjoy them every time. Joop and Henk Harton. Tom
I am from Exeter and i know some of theose kids!I thought th woman on the show was playing up a small problem because i have never seen drinking like that down on the quay and it is near where I live. Why cant youngsters in this country drink like in france? If they can do it early on then the novalty wears off after a while and they drink more responsably. Chris
I drank when i was 14 (i am now 17) and my friends and i had no problems, maybe because we have drunk more sensibly. Maybe if spirits were sold only to those with passport or drivers license identification then the young ones getting hold of alcohol can only buy alcopops and beer and therefore will drink more slowly and won't over drink as much, reducing the prroblem. Let them have there fun but safety comes first, plus to reduce of the use of the services. Emily Denyer
Well i was watching the programme on the telly and you are right i have seen kids while me and my friend are on the way to school and there is a boy no older than 13 and he always walks to a local corner shop goes in and comes out with TOBACCO!Me and my friend are surprised that he isnt dead in fact we see quite a few teenagesmokers!!! Gerard Maguire
I have just watched your clip on fake ID's and would like you to ask the Devon & Cornwall police force where were they???? This is a known area for underage drinking which I may add fuels the binge drinking culture we all hear about.. I want to know what are the police doing to address this issue as I see my Police contribution to my concil tax has risen!! I have never seen a police officer in that area. If they stamp out / try control underage drinking now, they will reduce the issues of binge drinking in the future. Helen Somerton
My 13 year old daughter likes the internet but was totally unaware of such things such as fake Id's and the websites mentioned. She knows all about it now!!! That information should not have been aired so early in the evening and the BBC should be more responiable. Another issue I as a parent have to worry about!

Washington Post political reporter John Wagner (6/19/16) reported on Bernie Sanders' continuing Secret Service detail, throwing in a too-clever-by-half talking point that has since gone viral. In “An Expensive Reminder That Sanders Still Hasn't Dropped Out: His Secret Service Detail,” Wagner used an eight-year-old stat to provide urgency to his general thesis that Sanders' quixotic campaign is draining us, the good American “taxpayer,” of resources:
Such round-the-clock protection can cost taxpayers more than $38,000 a day.
Over the next 48 hours, this tidbit quickly spread across several outlets, providing a good clickbait-friendly fable of Sanders' egoism run expensively amok:
Taxpayers Are Still Paying for Bernie Sanders' Secret Service Detail – ( CBS News , 6/20/16)
– ( , 6/20/16) Sanders' Secret Service Detail Costs Taxpayers $38,000 Every Day He Continues His Campaign ( Jezebel , 6/20/16)
( , 6/20/16) Report: Sanders' Secret Service Bill More Than $38,000 a Day ( The Hill , 6/19/16)
( , 6/19/16) Sanders' Refusal to End Campaign Costs Taxpayers $38,000 a Day ( Slate , 6/19/16)
( , 6/19/16) Bernie Sanders' Continuous Campaigning Is Costing Taxpayers $38,000 a Day (AOL.com, 6/20/16)
The Washington Post's Philip Bump and David Weigel both used the same “Sanders is costing the taxpayer $38,000 per day” framing in their respective tweets boosting the story.
The cynicism of the talking point reached a depressing low with this tweet from Clinton surrogate and actress Debra Messing:
Wudnt it is amazing if Sanders asked that the $38,000 a day was donated to Orlando families? https://t.co/dGrq4BpeQV — Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) June 19, 2016
How does Messing propose that the Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security, given Sanders' authorization to stop protecting him, turn the resulting savings into cash for the purposes of “donating to Orlando families”? She, of course, won't be proposing any such process, because this talking point is based on shallow moralizing, not on an honest assessment of the costs of Sanders' continuing his campaign. Even without the exploitation of the Orlando attack, it's a talking point that doesn't make any sense.
The number the Post reported was frequently used by then–Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan in 2008. From CBS News (4/4/08):
The Secret Service is spending about $38,000 per candidate per day, Sullivan said, and at the height of campaign season later this year expects to spend $44,000 per candidate each day. The agency has protected candidates at more than 1,000 campaign venues and has put 550,000 people through magnetometers and metal detectors, he said.
Notice Sullivan isn't saying the Secret Service is spending $38,000 per candidate in addition to what they would spend anyway. He's only saying it's what they spent per candidate. This, one can assume, includes fixed costs, like labor and infrastructure. Clearly, protecting Sanders also has other costs above fixed ones—like overtime, per diems, travel—but without any context or knowledge of what the $38,000 is in reference to, it's a totally useless number. Wagner is taking a one-off McStat without explaining how it was arrived at, and using it to mean something much more specific and consequential.
The sleight-of-hand comes from taking a specific budget item and assuming that if it wasn't there, the costs associated with it would disappear rather than be displaced. Wagner does this by saying “protection can cost taxpayers more than $38,000 a day,” which gives the reader the impression that if Sanders dropped out, “taxpayers” would magically get back $38,000.
Does anyone think the Secret Service is going to fire the exact number of agents assigned to Sanders the day he drops out? Does anyone think the additional vehicles and equipment needed will quickly be pawned off and the money transferred over to Johnny Taxpayer? Does anyone repeat this talking point think that if the Sanders campaign had ended one week ago the US federal government would somehow be $166,000 richer?
Of course not, because anyone with a passing understanding of how federal budgets work knows that budgets are based on approximates, not line items picked on an as-needed basis. So, even if the claim is true as such—even if the $38,000 is in reference to monies needed beyond the Secret Service's normal course of operation—it still doesn't make any sense. Until the Secret Services asks Congress for additional funds, there is no money being added or taken from their actual budget, and thus no money being added or taken away from “the taxpayer.”
The framing ignores this and uses a Grover Norquist–like gimmick of isolating one-off costs as something being taken away from the “taxpayer”—a term with considerable right-wing baggage and whose uniform adoption here by journalists belies their ostensibly neutral motives.
When FAIR reached out to the Secret Service for comment on the $38,000 figure, a spokesperson told us, just as they told the Post, that they “do not comment on the details of protection.”
This messaging trick has been used against Clinton, too, with stories such as “Investigating Hillary Clinton's Emails Costs As Much As $13,000 A Day” (Vocativ, 3/29/16). In this case as well, a price tag is presented as though the FBI agents working her case would otherwise be fired if they weren't kept busy with the email probe. But the FBI, like the Secret Service, doesn't have 100 percent labor liquidity, rendering these type of cartoon breakdowns at best misleading and at worst demagogic.

Consider, too: the drone wars were initiated under the presidency of George Bush. But it is the Democrat Barack Obama who has given them flight and stumped up sufficient funding to spark serious debate on the end of the ''Top Gun'' era of the fighter-pilot. And there is this: despite decades of American disquiet about assassinations abroad and a shrill Republican critique of him as a security wuss, the professorial Obama is the new killer on the block, authorising more drone attacks in the first year of his term in office than Bush did in his entire presidency. At the White House these days they hold their breath, praying for a turnaround in the war in Afghanistan to vindicate Obama's gamble in dispatching 50,000 more young Americans to a conflict some deem unwinnable. But confidence in the use of state-sanctioned lethal force in the undeclared American war in neighbouring and nuclear-armed Pakistan borders on the giddy. "The only game in town" was how CIA director Leon Panetta described it last year. As a covert operation, insufficient data is released to judge its efficacy. It took publication by the Pakistani media of Google Earth images of Predator aircraft on the ground at a base in Pakistan to elicit oblique CIA confirmation that the program actually operated there. Last month a CIA spokesman, Paul Gimigliano, only said the agency's ''counter-terrorism operations - lawful, aggressive, precise and effective - continue without pause".
Mehsud's is an impressive scalp of war - for Washington and Islamabad. He had been in the leadership post for just five months after his predecessor of two years, Baitullah Mehsud, suffered a similar fate in August. The first drone strikes of the new presidency took place on Obama's third day in office - four Arabs, presumed to be al-Qaeda associates, died in a strike in the border region. But as many as 16 members of the extended family of a respected pro-government tribal elder died when the second drone strike that day went terribly awry. A study by the New America Foundation last year found that just six of 41 CIA-launched drone attacks in the border region had targeted al-Qaeda members. Eighteen of the targets were Taliban and 16 of them alone were efforts to kill Baitullah Mehsud - which, depending on who did the counting, racked up more than 300 additional civilian deaths. Body-counting is a fraught business. Called Revenge of the Drones, the NAF study concluded that, since January 2008, the American kill has included ''about 20 leaders of al-Qaeda, the Taliban and allied groups … in addition to hundreds of lower-level militants and civilians. Under President Obama, the strikes have taken out at most [a] half-dozen militant leaders while also killing as many as 530 others - of those, around 250 to 400 are reported to have been lower-level militants, about three-quarters; and about a quarter appear to have been civilians." The number of civilian deaths and their implication are hotly debated - because of the extent to which they inflame anti-American sentiment in Pakistan and because the vaporised death of a target denies any opportunity to capture and interrogate him.
Writing in The New York Times, the counter-insurgency experts David Kilcullen and Andrew Exum decried the toll. Citing a civilian figure of 700, they extrapolated a civilian loss of 98 per cent of deaths or 50 civilians for each militant eliminated. Bill Roggio, the managing editor of the respected American blog The Long War Journal, goes to the other extreme, claiming only 10 per cent of those killed could be described as civilians. After a detailed study of media and other reports from the border region, Revenge of the Drones takes a middle course, opting for a civilian toll of about one-third of those killed. Just like their political and military leaders, Pakistanis give conflicting signals on the drone wars. Last summer a Gallup poll found only 10 per cent support for the attacks, but about half in a study of 550 professional people living in the border region described the strikes as accurate, and a little more than half estimated that the strikes damaged the militants without increasing anti-US sentiment. The changed ground rules making extrajudicial killing more acceptable are a product of post-September 11 thinking. In 2001 Bush overturned President Gerald Ford's 1976 prohibition on assassinations by US intelligence agencies - but there's something else in the works, too.
Despite its loyalty to Israel, the Bush administration condemned Israel's campaign of targeted assassinations in the Palestinian Occupied Territories in the weeks before the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington. But, as critics of the drone wars struggle to get traction in public debate, it is curious that in the absence of any negative reaction to Obama's expansion of his remote killing program last year, the former Bush administration was under attack for revelations that it had considered dispatching more traditional hit-squads abroad to take out al-Qaeda operatives. Forty-four countries now use unmanned aircraft for surveillance - only the US and Israel deploy them as killers. In the first weeks of his presidency Obama reportedly wrestled with the moral and strategic implications of the program. But, as reported in The New York Times, he pointedly declared to one of his earliest Situation Room gatherings: "The CIA gets what it needs." The American Civil Liberties Union explained in Freedom of Information application last month: "It appears … that lethal force is being exercised by individuals who are not in the military chain of command, are not subject to military rules and discipline; and do not operate under any other public system of accountability or oversight." A Democrat's targeted killings, it seems, are not quite the same as those of a Republican.
The first drones flew before the September 11 attacks - searching for Osama bin Laden. Now the US Air Force estimates that about 15 per cent of its $US230 billion ($260 billion) arms-procurement program will be spent on robot equipment within five years. Predators can fly 700 kilometres, then hover for 30 hours at a stretch, feeding real-time video and other data through 10 simultaneous streams to controllers in 10 locations. Priced at $US4.5 million, Predators carry sensors that intercept electronic signals and listen in on phone conversations - and they carry missiles. The newer Reapers cost $US17 million and can fly nearly 6000 kilometres. The US Air Force now has more drone operators in training than fighter and bomber pilots.

Some 7,200 gallons of concentrated Mountain Dew syrup created a "huge foaming event" and generated environmental concerns after it went down the drain, literally, at the Pepsi bottling plant on Mason Road in Howell last month.
The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality was at the plant on several occasions after a tank ruptured and sent the syrup through a floor drain and into the plant's internal sewer system on March 10, said DEQ Senior Environmental Quality Analyst Carla Davidson.
"A spill of this magnitude is highly unusual,” Davidson said, noting the high-sugar syrup can have a toxic effect on aquatic life if it ends up in rivers, lakes or streams.

Most of the spill was contained, and PepsiCo and city officials said proper procedures were used following the spill. Davidson disagreed.
“They could have chosen to isolate,” Davidson said, noting she did not visit the scene until later, so information about the initial chain of events came from reports submitted by PepsiCo and compiled later by DEQ staff. “They have an equalization basin; they knew there was a spill and they could have tried to isolate it, then have that waste water hauled away to protect the integrity of their pretreatment system.
“That's what normally we would recommend during a spill event like that,” she added.
Davidson said plant management attempted to treat the problem without outside intervention for two days, until the system became overwhelmed. The DEQ received a call to its Pollution Emergency Alert System line just before midnight on March 12, when the syrup, mixed with a large amount of waste water already in the system, created a “a huge foaming event” and sent an estimated 56,000 gallons of sugary sewage flowing out of the system.
Most of the spilled 56,000 gallons flowed into the on-site storm water detention basin, where it was contained, Davidson said, while a small amount went into a ditch behind Key Plastics, where an earthen dam was constructed to contain it.
Pepsi also brought in an environmental contractor, and Davidson said when she visited the following Friday, it was evident the soil had been scraped and the area cleaned up.
“As far as impact to the environment, I think Pepsi is cleaning it up, and we'll be working with them to prevent discharges like this from happening in the future,” Davidson said. “There was not a release to surface water that we know of, so that's also a positive.”
“They told us a syrup tank ruptured, so one question we will be asking is ‘Why did this happen?' We want to make sure the other tanks have good structural integrity, and any maintenance needed is done.”
Howell City Manager Shea Charles said he and other city employees were onsite during the days following the spill and said he believed Pepsi flowed protocol for such an event.
“We were out there monitoring; it did not get into the public sewer system,” Charles said, noting any waste that spilled on the ground was contained as it froze when temperatures dropped.”
Jennifer Ryan, a New York-based PepsiCo spokesperson, issued the following statement via email: “Being good stewards of the environment and the communities in which we operate is one of our highest priorities. When this event occurred we immediately took action to mitigate the impact, and we continue to work collaboratively with our neighbors and local agencies to ensure that our clean-up efforts are in compliance with all applicable regulations and meet our company's high environmental standards.”

The TextStar Serial LCD Display from Cat's Whisker Technologies is a nice little 16x2 display. It's quite a sophisticated screen including 4 buttons to transmit characters too. It's a perfect companion for the Raspberry Pi as you can run it straight off the 3.3v supply and TTL serial pins without the need for an RS232 converter like a MAX232. It couldn't be easier!As the video shows I have written some software to use the 4 buttons as page buttons.The ip address screen is really useful if you are set up for DHCP. Just plug in and it shows you the address needed to access your Raspberry Pi on the network.On Raspbian:On Arch:and then reboot.
It's the chain that keeps us together, the – er – thinking about tomorrow that doesn't stop, and though we've been down one time, been down two times, we keep on going back there. Almost four decades on and ‘Rumours', this paragon of West Coast FM dream-pop, still exerts a pull, both on the sort of young, hip band that raided the Mac oeuvre for last year's ‘Just Tell Me That You Want Me' compilation and you, you are the punter who hared out and bought the deluxe 35th anniversary reissue.
So naturally you'll be familiar with the album, but I'm going to take a flier and hope you might not know these 20 facts. Not completely anyway.
1. Let's start with the numbers. To date(-ish), the Mac's unit-shifting megabeast has gone 11 times platinum in the UK, and a frankly excessive 20 times platinum in the States. Its accumulated global sales have now zoomed past 40-bleedin'-million copies.
2. It totted up 31 weeks (not all at once – they're not Bryan Adams) at No.1 in the US album charts. In the UK, it managed one. A paltry one. Take a long hard look at yourselves.
Sharethrough (Mobile)
3. The singles did the business too. Not so much over here, where ‘Go Your Own Way', ‘Don't Stop' and ‘Dreams' reached #38, 32 and 24 respectively, but certainly in the States where all three and ‘You Make Loving Fun' went top three, and ‘Dreams' broke through the million barrier at No.1.
4. A beautiful, peerlessly accessible record, ‘Rumours' was of course mired in strife. You'll know all about Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks falling apart in acrimony and Christine McVie leaving husband John for a lighting director while Mick Fleetwood picked up the pieces (which mainly involved jumping in bed with Nicks). But Fleetwood was also splitting with his wife Jenny Boyd, the sister of Pattie – subject of The Beatles' ‘Something' and later Derek And The Dominos' ‘Layla' as Eric Clapton wooed her away from husband George Harrison. The 70s, eh?
5. Opening track ‘Second Hand News' – which finds Buckingham damaged after the shenanigans with Nicks and in no mood to commit elsewhere – was an attempt to emulate the rickety, funky rhythm of the Bee Gees' ‘Jive Talkin”, released a couple of years earlier, itself inspired by the Gibbs' car trundling over a bridge in Miami.
6. The balls proudly hanging between Fleetwood's legs on the cover were already a staple of his stage get-up and were in fact toilet chains half-inched from a club the ‘Mac played in their formative years.
7. ‘I Don't Want To Know' had originally been worked up by Buckingham Nicks, the duo made up of, well, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks before they parachuted in to save Fleetwood Mac from bluesy obscurity in the mid 70s.
8. Cyndi Lauper recorded a version of ‘You Make Loving Fun' in 1977, as a soundalike for radio when the original version proved too expensive for stations to swallow.
9. Stevie Nicks wasn't wild about ‘Go Your Own Way”s lyrical content. You know, “shacking up is all you wanna do” and all that. She thought it was “angry, nasty and extremely disrespectful”. Language she normally reserves for Nicki Minaj.
10. Mick Fleetwood took all the splits and affairs terribly seriously, referring to the mayhem as an “emotional hiccup” and a “classic intergalactic mess”.
11. In a towering display of respect for the integrity of the finished album, Warner Bros initially released the cassette version with opener ‘Second Hand News' swapping places with middle-of-side-two track ‘I Don't Want To Know'.
12. ‘The Chain' was the theme tune for the BBC's Grand Prix coverage, which began in earnest in 1978. Oh, you knew that already. When the BBC won back the rights to Formula One in 2009 after more than a decade without, popular opinion saw the theme reinstated. You knew that too. OK, following its reinstatement in 2009 the track reached No.94 in the chart. There.
13. The album's original, working title was ‘Yesterday's Gone', pilfered from ‘Don't Stop”s chorus.
14. On closing track ‘Gold Dust Woman' Buckingham plays a Dobro. You can see one of these ornate resonator guitars on the cover of Dire Straits' ‘Brothers In Arms'.
15. Co-producer Ken Caillat describes Buckingham during the ‘Rumours' sessions as “a nervous Nellie… He'd come in in the morning, always rubbing his hands together. He kept a big tape box full of pot, and he was always rolling a joint.”
16. Here's one that a few current artists could take to heart: ‘Rumours' was designed as a “no filler” product, where every track could hold its own as a single.
17. Christine McVie's ‘Songbird' – later covered by Eva Cassidy – was recorded away from the studio at the University of California's Zellerbach Auditorium, giving it its distinctive, soft distance.
18. In the UK, ‘Rumours' gave up the No.1 spot to ‘The Album' by ABBA, another band not entirely unfamiliar with slightly uncomfortable internal tension.
19. A year of painstaking recording – including heaps of overdubs, with few songs featuring instruments recorded aside one another – saw the release pushed back from its original date of September 1976 and an entire sold-out tour canned.
20. Christine McVie wrote ‘Oh Daddy' about Fleetwood, the daddy of the band. The seemingly backhanded compliment that “everything you do is just alright” is supposed to acknowledge he was always right. Apart from taking that BRITs gig, presumably.
DAVIE, Fla. -- One of the most impressive accomplishments involving Jay Ajayi's breakout season in 2016 is he only started 12 games.
Add in the fact Ajayi didn't play at all in Week 1 and didn't get rolling until Week 6 -- with 204 rushing yards against the Pittsburgh Steelers -- and you have an idea of the small window the tailback used to notch a career-best 1,272 rushing yards and eight touchdowns.
Ajayi is entering 2017 as a full-time starter for the first time in his NFL career. Dolphins head coach Adam Gase recently said Ajayi could get as many as 350 rushing attempts if the running back stays healthy and plays all 16 games, which is 90 more attempts than last season.
"I'm ready for it," Ajayi said Tuesday during the opening of Miami's organized team activities. "I prepare myself every season to take a huge workload and be able to carry the team, and I think I'm ready for that."
This is a significant alert for fantasy football owners.
Based on Ajayi's 4.9-yard-per-carry average in 2016, 350 attempts would put Ajayi at 1,715 rushing yards. However, defenses will be focused heavily each week on stopping Ajayi, who was the engine behind Miami's offense last season.
This offseason is unique for Ajayi. The third-year running back is coming off his first Pro Bowl appearance. Ajayi is more recognizable in public and more respective among his peers.
Ajayi was recently voted in the NFL's top-100 players for the first time at No. 69, which he deemed a "cool" feat.
"It's a good accomplishment," Ajayi said. "(I'm) striving to be No. 1."
The Dolphins' hot streak and run to the playoffs coincided with the tailback's streak of putting together big games towards the middle and end of last season. The Dolphins were 6-0 when Ajayi rushed for 77 yards or more last season.
Expect more explosiveness from quarterback Ryan Tannehill and the passing game with additions such as tight end Julius Thomas and the return of deep-threat Kenny Stills to go with receivers Jarvis Landry and DeVante Parker.
"It's really exciting," Ajayi said. "Just going out on the field (Tuesday) for the first OTA and not seeing too many new faces -- guys who have been in the program since last year -- and we kind of know what to expect from each other."
So was it a “hack” or a “leak”? According to President Obama, apparently both.
During the president's final press conference of 2016, Obama called the release of DNC staff emails the result of a “hack” — and a “leak”.
“Once we had clarity and certainty around what, in fact had happened, we publicly announced that, in fact, Russian had hacked into the DNC,” Obama said.
Obama claimed his administration didn't “interpret” what was happening, but instead, just passing along what they saw as the facts.
“We simply let people know, just as we had let members of Congress know, that this had happened,” Obama said.
He said the media wrote stories about the emails and “interpreted what had happened.”
Obama insisted he wanted to “play it straight.”
“We weren't trying to advantage one side or another, but what we were trying to do is let people know that this had taken place and so if you started seeing the effects on the election, if you were trying to measure why this was happening, and how you should consume the information that was being leaked, that you might want to take this into account,” Obama said.
So was the information “hacked” or “leaked”?
Rayful Edmond III's extensive cocaine network and ties to Colombian drug cartels marked a shift in D.C.'s drug trade, which had previously been dominated by small-time dealers in constant search of supplies. (Photo courtesy of May 3rd Films)
April 15, 1989 – almost “go time.” A joint force of DEA, FBI and D.C. Police officials had spent nearly two years building their case against the District's largest drug network, and a series of coordinated raids had been carefully planned for the next day.
But then rumors began to circulate that word of the impending raids had leaked out onto the streets. Worried that their opportunity would be lost, authorities hurriedly put their plan into action, early.
At 5:30pm, officers arrested Tony Lewis at his home in Arlington. A few hours later, they nabbed the big prize – alleged ring leader Rayful Edmond III – at his girlfriend's house in the 900 block of Jefferson St., NW. With the two biggest targets in custody, officials launched searches at more than a dozen other addresses in the District and Maryland, including Edmond's grandmother's rowhouse at 407 M Street, NE, which was thought to be the headquarters of the operation.
And what an operation it was.
Edmond allegedly supervised a wholesale and retail illegal narcotics business that brought in 1,700 pounds of cocaine a month from California and employed more than 150 people. At the height of the District's drug epidemic of the late 1980s, business was good – very good. The group generated as much as 2 million dollars a week and controlled perhaps 50% of the cocaine trafficking in the city.
The inner workings of the Edmond's network sound like the script from a movie or perhaps a certain HBO series.
Much of the cocaine was purchased from the Los Angeles-based Crips gang, which had a direct connection to a Colombian drug cartel. Couriers from Edmond's network would travel to California carrying suitcases full of money – often 3 million dollars or more. After making the purchase, the couriers would return to D.C. by plane or in rented vans filled with drugs.
As The Washington Post described it, “The bags of cocaine allegedly were distributed to street sellers by lieutenants with names like 'Mad Dog,' 'Whitey' and 'Fat Cheese.'…. After selling the crack, the sellers turned in their proceeds to lieutenants…. Walkie-talkies were used so the lieutenants, sellers and lookouts could communicate and ensure that the sellers would not be robbed.” The inner circle was a close-knit family organization.
Any time police came by on patrol, lookouts shouted warnings. “Oller-ray! Oller-ray!” Pig-Latin for “roller,” which was street-slang for patrol car. Trip wires and debris were strewn across alleys to help dealers avoid arrest.
Associates spoke in code to disguise their dealings. Street sellers were paid $400-800 per week but could make as much as $5000. “Mules,” who transported the drugs from L.A., were paid as much as $1,000 per kilogram that they brought to the Washington area. Other couriers were paid for delivering cash to Los Angeles for drug purchases.
Enforcers armed with automatic weapons kept away rival dealers and killed those who infringed upon Edmond's territory, which was centered around the open air drug market at Orleans Place, NE but spread to other parts of the city. Over 30 homicides during 1988-89 were attributed to clashes between Edmond's network and rival groups.
For his own protection, Edmond himself kept a certain amount of distance from the day-to-day dealings of his organization. He was not handling the drugs or cash on the street. But the flashy lifestyle the business afforded him – with his fleet of cars, designer clothes and expensive jewelry – certainly made an impression. As the Post put it, “Edmond was something of a walking advertisement for his organization.”
Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson, Jr., shown here with President Reagan and Patrick Ewing, requested a meeting with Edmond after learning that he had befriended some Georgetown players.
The company he kept was also a source of interest. A few days after the raids, ABC News broadcast a special two-and-a-half hour, live edition of Nightline from Our Lady of Perpetual Help church in Anacostia. Among the revelations that came out of the program was that Edmond – a big basketball fan – had been associating with Georgetown University basketball players, including star center Alonzo Mourning and that coach John Thompson had requested a meeting with the reputed dealer.
As Thompson told host Ted Koppel, “I didn't get into his background or conduct an interrogation; that's for the police. But the legal process is a long one, while the problem is an immediate one. I tried to make sure he knew the goals and objectives of my kids, and [tried to] make it very clear to him that I didn't want anything going on with my kids. I was trying to deal immediately with a specific problem.”
On September 11, 1989, Edmond went on trial along with 10 associates including several family members and Tony Lewis. Edmond was charged with leading a continuing criminal enterprise, which carried a sentence of life in prison.
Authorities implemented unprecedented security measures for the case. The courtroom was equipped with a bulletproof shield separating those involved from spectators. Additional bulletproof panels protected the judge and jurors, and the courtroom was ringed with U.S. Marshals.
In addition, U.S. District Judge Charles R. Richey ordered that the jury be sequestered during the trial and their names be kept secret – even from him – on the grounds that jurors' fear of retaliation by Edmond's network could remove “any semblance of an impartial jury.”
Rather than being detained at D.C. Jail, Edmond was held at Quantico Marine Corps base and flown in daily by helicopter. It was media spectacle.
The trial lasted 56 days. Prosecutors presented Edmond as a charismatic drug mastermind who had learned the trade from his parents at a young age. Jurors heard vivid descriptions of Edmond's flashy lifestyle, which the prosecution claimed was funded by drugs and violence. The most damaging piece of evidence was a secretly-recorded conversation in which Edmond's mother, Constance “Bootsie” Perry, told an associate that her son had started off as a small-time drug dealer but then “just got too big” and went out on his own.
Defense lawyers portrayed Edmond as a compulsive gambler who earned up to $50,000 per week playing dice and numbers and used his winnings to fund his lifestyle.
On December 6, the jury reached its decision. Rayful Edmond III was found guilty on all counts and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens celebrated the verdict and said the case was evidence that law enforcement officials “stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of this community to turn the tide of drugs that have so devastated this city.”
Edmond maintained his innocence, claiming authorities were looking for someone to blame for the drug problems on the D.C. Streets. “I am not the person the U.S. Government is trying to make me out to be.” He also said he believed he would have received a fairer trial if the jury had been racially integrated. (All 12 jurors were black.) “I'm not racist, but white people would have taken their time. They would have gone by the law... This jury never asked any questions about the law. Even me—I'm intelligent—and I studied the legal issues. I didn't understand some of it. I'm not saying they weren't intelligent. They just weren't fair.... They came in too quick.”
It was the longest and costliest drug trial in D.C. history. (Over $258,000 alone had been spent on transporting, housing, feeding and protecting jurors.) Edmond, 24, was sent to the Federal Penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania to serve his sentence. And so ended the career of the biggest drug dealer in D.C. history…
Except that it didn't.
Edmond went to prison for life in 1990 but continued to broker drug deals from the inside using the penitentiary phones and mail.
In Lewisburg, Edmond made contacts with other inmates who had connections to Colombia's Medellin drug cartel (a different cartel from the one with which he had previously dealt) and was soon back in business. Using prison phones, mail and visiting hours, he brokered deals between the Colombian suppliers and D.C. drug dealers. (Edmond would make collect calls from the prison to associates in D.C., who would then patch him through to contacts in Colombia.) He even mediated disputes and persuaded the Colombians not to kill Washington dealers who fell behind in their payments.
For his role, Edmond was paid handsomely, earning over $200,000 before the scheme was discovered. But what good would $200,000 do a man who was locked up for life? For Edmond, his second career represented something more basic. As he explained later, "At the time, my mindset was I had to still have people look up to me and prove that I was still capable of making things happen.”
When word of Edmond's new enterprise went public in 1996, U.S. Attorney Eric Holder blasted the Federal Bureau of Prisons, “It is intolerable that criminals who were incarcerated for the precise purpose of protecting our citizens have instead been able to use prison facilities as their home offices for creating and commanding massive narcotics enterprises that have left nothing in their wake but death and destruction.”
By then, however, the saga of Rayful Edmond III had taken another twist. In exchange for the government reducing his mother's sentence – in 1990, Constance Perry had received a 14 year sentence for her participation in her son's drug ring – Edmond reached a deal to become a government informant. Operating from inside the prison system, he began setting up drug traffickers on the outside for law enforcement to take down.
In 1998, Edmond's testimony helped convict 11 people on drug trafficking charges. His mother was released from prison and he was put into the prison system's witness protection program. His current location of incarceration is confidential.

Man Defrauding Public for Charitable Donations for Over a Year Fined 200 Baht and Released
CityNews – Police have caught and fined a man using a fake ID claiming he is a reporter from Channel 8 and the Chiang Mai Biker Association to solicit donations from people around the Night Bazaar area.
According to a police report published on October 11th, a 32-year-old man from Ayutthaya was arrested after it was found that he had been using a fake ID to solicit donations from people in Chiang Mai. He had reportedly walked around the Night Bazaar most evenings with documents asking for donations for various causes as a representative of Channel 8 and the Chiang Mai Bikers Association.
He told police he had been doing this since 2016 after coming to Chiang Mai on the free train, earning up to 4,000 baht per day. He confessed to the crime and told police he did the same in Lamphun, Lampang and Lopburi.
Chiang Mai Biker Association and Channel 8 have both confirmed that they have no knowledge of this person and that they do not solicit donations in person.
Despite his ongoing fraud, with a potential of stealing over 1.4 million baht from people over the last year, police charged him with a 200 baht fine for asking for donations in a public place without a permit and released him from custody.
The police said that should any persons come and report that they had been cheated by him, then a criminal investigation can begin. Until then they are unable to press charges.
Government refusal to guarantee funding for schemes will force families to turn to food banks and loan sharks, say critics
Poverty charities and councils have warned that the government's refusal to guarantee funding for local welfare schemes will force low income families in crisis to turn to food banks and loan sharks.
The government announced in January that it would no longer provide £180m central funding for local welfare assistance schemes operated by English local authorities after April 2015, triggering a cross-party revolt by Conservative MPs and council leaders, Labour councils and charities.
It is believed that the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, attempted to secure £70m for local welfare to announce in Thursday's local government finance settlement, but was blocked by the chancellor, George Osborne.
The local government minister Kris Hopkins told the Commons on Thursday that there would be no additional funding for local welfare, although he encouraged councils to make further formal representations, raising faint hopes that the government may revisit the decision in February.
Local welfare provision offers emergency help for a range of vulnerable people who fall into unexpected crisis, including women fleeing domestic violence, homeless people, pregnant mothers, care leavers, pensioners and people suffering from chronic physical and mental health problems.
Some in Whitehall are understood to be concerned that cutting local welfare will provide additional fuel to critics who argue the government does not care about poverty. A cross-party report on food banks this month urged the government to protect local welfare assistance, saying food bank referrals would increase if it was not reinstated.
Hopkins said that although there would be no new funds for local welfare, ministers would outline a notional figure of £130m in the overall grant allocations to councils – a cut of £50m – although this would not be ring-fenced, meaning councils can spend it on other services.
Cllr Andy Hull, Labour-run Islington council's executive member for finance, called the decision not to provide local welfare funding “an early Christmas present from the government for loan sharks and payday lenders.”
He added: “This safety net supports families to stay together, helps people sustain their tenancies and keeps kids out of care. It is a lifeline, not a luxury. Now, thanks to the government, it lies in shreds.”
The Local Government Association said almost three-quarters of local authorities will abandon or scale back local welfare schemes unless they receive government funding. Two county councils, Nottinghamshire and Oxfordshire, have already closed their schemes.
Alison Garnham, chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said: “In the long-run tax payers will foot a higher bill if low-income families can't stop a one-off, unforeseen expense from becoming a full-blown crisis – and the human cost will be high. For mothers leaving violent partners or youngsters moving on from homelessness or care, the schemes can make the difference between managing or not.”
Helen Middleton of the Furniture Reuse Network, whose member charities work closely with councils on helping low-income families, said the decision showed the government had “no real understanding of the levels of poverty in this country”.
Homelessness charity Centrepoint said young homeless people used local welfare schemes as a vital safety net: “It's completely unacceptable that young people who have fought to turn their lives around after facing homelessness are once again left to sleep on floors for lack of something as basic as a bed.
“Ministers must look carefully at responses from councils to this announcement and consider whether their proposal really reflects the level of poverty in many of our communities.”
Matthew Reed, chief executive of the Children's Society, said: “The government's decision to reduce annual funding from £172m to £130m will make it harder for councils to support vulnerable families facing a crisis. The requirement that town halls fund their schemes from within existing budgets may create a postcode lottery for many families in poverty.”

BIG QUESTIONS
1) Any chance a team would like to take on the contracts of Charlie Villaneuva and/or Ben Gordon?
Not very likely.
Charlie Villaneuva has a player option worth $8.6 million for next season (which he would be stupid not to take). He is currently being paid $8 million for this year.
After averaging 7.0 points in just 13 games this past regular season, Villaneuva's stock has fallen considerably. He has failed to top the 12.0 point mark in his 3 years with the team and has yet to live up to the 5 year, $35 million dollar contract he signed back in 2009.
Ben Gordon has also been a huge disappointment for Detroit. In his last 3 years with Chicago, Gordon didn't average any worse than 18.6 points a game. In his 3 years with the Pistons, he hasn't averaged more than 14 points in a season. His 5 year, $55 million dollar contract has yet to be repaid with on-court success.
The amount of money both players are making and the cap space they take up has hurt the Pistons tremendously in the franchises rebuilding process. Both Villaneuva and Gordon were overpaid and overvalued to begin with.
Detroit still has their amnesty option which they could use on either player. I could certainly see the Pistons wanting to cut ties immediately with one of the two and use their one-time amnesty to relieve themselves of this financial burden.
As far as finding a team to trade with, I seriously doubt that will happen. Neither player is worth the money they are making and neither man is talented enough to make that much of a difference for any team at this point.
2) After 1 full season with Detroit, where does Brandon Knight rank amongst the top point guards of the NBA? Any chance he becomes a future all-star in this league?
I'm not saying Knight doesn't have the potential to be a great point guard in this league, but he certainly has a long way to go before he reaches that level.
He was never going to be like Cavaliers guard Kyrie Irving in the way that he just waltzed into Cleveland and changed the outlook of that franchise from day 1. Knight is a project and will take some serious time to develop.
Who would I take over Knight right now? How about….
(The Obvious) Rondo, Williams, Paul, Rose, Westbrook, Parker, Nash, Lawson
(“Not So” Obvious) Harris, Felton, Curry, Wall, Jennings, Augustin, Billups, Conley Jr, Rubio, Miller, Barea
Brandon Knight is just below all of these players on the NBA point guard scale. To be fair, he is a 1 year pro who played on a fairly weak Detroit Pistons team this past season. There is more pressure on guys like B.K to be stars since we have seen so many point guards drafted in the first round in recent years find immediate success.
In his first season in the NBA, Knight averaged 12.8 points, 3.2 rebounds and 3.8 assists. He did in fact however average 2.6 turnovers a game on top of that.
I believe his ceiling is an extremely poor mans Rajon Rondo. He has a solid frame at 6'3 and is fairly tall for a point guard. He also has the ability to take the ball to the net with precise penetration and skillful dribbling. He isn't a great shooter by any means (41% from the field), but taking jump shots shouldn't be how Knight gets his offense.
Is he a future all-star? The jury isn't out on him just yet, but the point guard crop is sooo deep that earning himself a future selection will be extremely difficult.

President Trump threatened to destroy North Korea on Tuesday in his first address to the United Nations General Assembly, referring to North Korea leader Kim Jong-un as a “Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
“Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime,” Trump told the gathering of world leaders and ambassadors.
“No nation on Earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with nuclear weapons and missiles,” he said.
“The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.”
Trump first referred to Kim as "Rocket Man" on Sunday when mentioning a call he had with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.
I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night. Asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2017
The president's comments come after the United Nations Security Council last week for a second time voted unanimously to increase sanctions on North Korea over its recent missile tests. Trump thanked China and Russia, two countries that have been reluctant to rein in Pyongyang's aggression, for voting in favor of the sanctions.

North Korea in July conducted two intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests, and earlier this month said it successfully tested a hydrogen bomb than can be placed on an ICBM.

Major League Soccer fans will now get the chance to buy a new jersey from their favorite team every year, after the league made changes to its rules about jersey releases.
Every team will now change at least one of its three jerseys - home, away or third - every season, per a league press release. Clubs will make their jersey releases over a period of time now known as "Jersey Week," which takes place this year from February 25-28.
Jerseys in this cycle have a lot of detail added into them based on the soccer culture that surrounds teams, including such features as season ticket holder names making up the horizontal lines on the Colorado Rapids' new home jerseys.
"I'm relatively new to the league, but the first thing that struck me was the incredible detail that went into the jerseys with Adidas and each of the clubs," Maribeth Towers, the league's senior vice president of consumer products, said to Jack Bell of the New York Times' Goal soccer blog. "It's apparent these are works of art." She added, "I think some of the details are lost to fans, like some slogans and team chants on the back inside collar tape, but every last detail has meaning to the club, its history or its city."
The Union embraced the history of soccer in Philadelphia, the Brotherly Game has learned, for their idea behind the new third jersey. (See a tease of the jersey on MLS Gear by clicking the linked text here, or in the picture above.)
"It's supposed to be a throwback," a source, who has seen the jersey, told the Brotherly Game. "The third jersey is an homage to the Bethlehem Steel Football Club."
[UPDATE: I have now received confirmation from two other sources that the jersey is Bethlehem Steel FC oriented. Also that BIMBO logo was likely redone for the jersey.]
Bethlehem Steel won nine championships in 21 years of existence, from 1911-30, and finished in second place in an additional five seasons. The club folded after the Great Depression destroyed the nation's economy and put to ruin both soccer leagues and Bethlehem Steel's financial outlook.
"The jersey has an original Bimbo logo, with an "M" that looks like mountains. It has a white collar and the ends of the sleeves have white adidas stripes. All else black*."
The source said he was also told that the team is planning on selling hoodies, shirts and other articles of clothing featuring the Bethlehem Steel logo this season.
*based on the teaser, the jersey may actually be a very dark navy blue.
An inter-university LGBT rights program in Hong Kong called Usupportlove launched a photo shoot inviting university students around Hong Kong to pair up and pose in support of marriage equality.
[via GayStarNews]
The Chinese University of Hong Kong
Siu Lung, a CUHK junior, describes how it is like hitting on a lake with love, and the ripples will hopefully spread. She believes gay rights need powerful fighters as much as the general public who provide the power. Freshman Big of PolyU says people in love deserve a chance to build their family and she will take a risk for love and be herself fearlessly. And as everyone celebrates with thier loved ones on Valentine's Day, students and volunteers from Usupportlove will set up booths in the bustling streets of Causeway Bay – again to promote the very message of marriage eqaulity.
The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
Bryan, a straight ally from the HKUST, says one doesn't have to be gay or bisexual to take these photos. Freshman Angus admits he has wavered between whether to show his face, but in the end he is convinced that fighting for human rights is nothing to be ashamed of.
The University of Hong Kong
Martina (Baptist University, junior) ‘Calling on relatives during Chinese New Year was so joyful, for everyone could get red packets. Visiting relatives during CNY as grown-ups now is still fun, but there are some who can only receive red packets. Giving out red packets is more than just giving a blessing. For some people, this is indeed an unreachable dream.' Can (University of Hong Kong, sophomore) ‘Right or wrong, beautiful or ugly, right or wrong. In the face of binary restrictions, is there nowhere to flee? I genuinely hope that one is not overvalued while the other is not underappreciated.'
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University
Jason (Baptist University, sophomore) ‘I did something huge today… Indeed, I had a photo shoot with my boyfriend and then uploaded it to the Internet to show off. It should really be nothing extraordinary, right? Isn't it common sense to hold your lover's hand in public? Everyone should have the right to to love, regardless of borders, genders or wealth. You can neither reject love, nor prevent others from loving who he/she loves…' Toby (Polytechnic University, freshman) ‘Love is about devotion, tolerance and respect… I often share relationship tidbits with my friends, and I've discovered that gay and straight couples have pretty much the same experiences. You meet each other, start dating, fall madly in love, exchange angry words, break up and get back together…The only difference is gay couples have to date secretly, learn to hide their love affairs, and repond to friends and relatives' “care” diplomatically.' ‘Don't let any fear today become regret in the future. Dread nothing, for love is sinless in itself!'

Testing
First we set up a function which returns test data:
test_table() ->
[{"pattern_1.splice",
"Saved with HW Version: 0.808-alpha
"
"Tempo: 120
"
"(0) kick |x---|x---|x---|x---|
"
"(1) snare |----|x---|----|x---|
"
"(2) clap |----|x-x-|----|----|
"
"(3) hh-open |--x-|--x-|x-x-|--x-|
"
"(4) hh-close |x---|x---|----|x--x|
"
"(5) cowbell |----|----|--x-|----|
"},
{"pattern_2.splice",
"Saved with HW Version: 0.808-alpha
"
"Tempo: 98.4
"
"(0) kick |x---|----|x---|----|
"
"(1) snare |----|x---|----|x---|
"
"(3) hh-open |--x-|--x-|x-x-|--x-|
"
"(5) cowbell |----|----|x---|----|
"},
...].
Returned is a list of pairs [{FileName, Expected}, …] where the file name is the binary file to read, and the pattern is a textual representation of the correct output. This allows us to implement a system which uses the list as a table-driven-test and verify every output is correct. It is followed by a simple function to test a single test case:
t({File, Expected}) ->
{ok, Dat} = file:read_file("priv/fixtures/" ++ File), %1
Output = iolist_to_binary(render(p(Dat))), %2
Output = list_to_binary(Expected), %3
ok.
This uses Erlangs binding rules in two ways. The reading of the binary file in (1) asserts that the output is {ok, Dat}. If the file read returns an error, this leads to a crash of the code. This is a common pattern in Erlang in which failures crash the program. We then install other strategies for restarting failing parts of a program later. In (2) we use the p/1 function to parse the file contents, then send it to the render/1 function and finally converts its output into binary data. We stuff this into the value Output. Finally, the (3) line attempts to stuff the expected output into the same value. The binding semantics of Erlang takes this as an assertion. That is, if the expected output of (3) doesn't match the output of (2); then the code will crash.
This is in contrast to many programming languages which would overwrite the value Output. But languages like Erlang and Prolog uses this to define an assertion. It is an often used trick in Erlang, since it avoids having to write assertion checks for a lot of code. In particular I don't need the common
if err != nil { ... }
which is common in Go programs.
We can now write the test-driver for the system:
test() ->
lists:foreach(fun t/1, test_table()).
Testing the code amounts to call our t/1 function on every data point in the test_table list. If this code doesn't crash, our tests passed. If the code crashes, Erlang returns a structural error with all the information we need to figure out what is wrong. Larger Erlang programs usually employ one the test systems Eunit or Common Test. But for a simple program, it is somewhat simpler just to use a simple function call to make sure things work as they should.
Parsing
Now we are ready to implement the the parser, which we do in the p/1 function. The format contains an identifying header, followed by some global information about the drum pattern and then followed by the instruments present in the drum pattern. We will have to parse these in order to handle the format and for the sake of simplicity we will parse the data and represent it internally as an abstract syntax tree. Then this tree will be fed to the rendering function later in order to render data in the textual format. In principle we are writing a compiler from the binary format to the textual format.
An atom() intermezzo is needed to explain a concept which may be helpful in the following. In Erlang an unquoted alphanumeric identifier starting with an upper-case character, such as “Payload” is a variable. An alphanumeric starting with a lower-case character such as “instrument” is an atom. Atoms are interned by representing them as integers internally in the VM. That is, when the file is loaded, each atom is mapped to an integer, picking a new integer if the atom has not been seen before. If the atom already occurs in the VM, the designated number for that atom is used of course. They are used as “tags” in programs to discriminate data, and in Erlang they are also used to represent module names and function names in some situations.
The advantage of atoms is their very quick equality check, because one doesn't have to walk through a costly string comparison. It is so-to-speak paid for in advance when the module is loaded into the system (or when foreign data enters the VM node).
And now, back to parsing…
Parsing the identifying header is the following function:
p(<<"SPLICE", Len:64/integer, Payload:Len/binary, _/binary>>) ->
p_data(Payload).
The function defines what is called a binary pattern match where the function expects binary data and then the function proceeds by “destructuring” (picking apart) the binary data according to the specfication given. This specification says:
First comes 6 bytes with ascii codes “SPLICE”
Next comes a 64-bit Big-Endian integer which we parse as the value Len
Next comes the Payload, which is Len bytes and are binary data.
Finally comes more data, which we disregard. This is needed because pattern 5 includes errornous data in the end and we have to match it.
Any parsing error crashes the function. If we manage to parse the data, we send the Payload on to the p_data/1 function:
p_data(<<HWStr:32/binary, Tempo:32/float-little, Data/binary>>) ->
Instruments = instruments(Data),
#{ format => splice, hardware_string => trim_hwstring(HWStr),
tempo => Tempo, instruments => Instruments }.
Again, we match the expected content. First comes 32 bytes of hardware string identification information. Then comes a 32 bit IEEE 754 Floating Point value in Little-Endian form. The rest is Instrument data, which we parse in a helper function called instruments/1. The return value is a map containing the data we found in the parse. The language is dynamic and we don't have to predeclare the contents of the map, but we simply just create one and add the necessary fields. The function trim_hwstring/1 is used to get rid of the trailing 0'es which is in the end of the hardware ID string:
trim_hwstring(B) ->
Str = binary_to_list(B),
string:strip(Str, right, 0).
Only two functions remain. The first one is decoding each instrument line:
instruments(<<Num:8/integer, L:32/integer, Name:L/binary,
Pattern:16/binary, Rest/binary>>) ->
[{instrument, Num, Name, pattern(Pattern)} | instruments(Rest)];
instruments(<<>>) ->
[].
Here, we have two possible matches. The first match is the one that picks an instrument apart. We expect:
An integer in 8 bits
A length in a 32 bit Big-Endian integer
A name, whose length was just given
A pattern, which is 16 bytes of pattern data
The “rest” or remainder of the binary data.
We then create a tuple {instrument, Num, Name, Pat} where the ‘instrument' part is an identifying atom/symbol we can use later to discriminate instruments from other data. The function recurses on the remainder of the data (the call to instruments(Rest)) and then when that call returns, it front-appends the current instrument to the list being built.
The other variant identifies <<>> which is the empty binary. If there are no instruments to parse, we return [] which is the empty list. The recursion here then gradually builds up a list of instruments by recursing to the end of the instrument data and then building up the list of instruments “in reverse”.
We only need to parse patterns:
pattern(<<P1:4/binary, P2:4/binary, P3:4/binary, P4:4/binary>>) ->
[binary_to_list(P) || P <- [P1, P2, P3, P4]].
A pattern is split into 4 groups with 4 bytes in each. We then use a list-comprehension, to convert each pattern binary into a list of bytes. Read: for each P in the list [P1, P2, P3, P4] replace P with binary_to_list(P). This returns a list(list(byte())) which will come in handy when we want to render output.
As an example, let us run this on pattern 1 and print its output. Erlang has a REPL which comes in handy for such exploratory tests:
3> {ok, Pattern1} = file:read_file("priv/fixtures/pattern_1.splice").
{ok,<<83,80,76,73,67,69,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,197,48,46,56,48,56,
45,97,108,112,104,97,0,0,...>>}
4> decoder_dm:p(Pattern1).
#{format => splice,
hardware_string => "0.808-alpha",
instruments => [{instrument,0,<<"kick">>,
[[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0]]},
{instrument,1,<<"snare">>,
[[0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0]]},
{instrument,2,<<"clap">>,
[[0,0,0,0],[1,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]},
{instrument,3,<<"hh-open">>,
[[0,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[1,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0]]},
{instrument,4,<<"hh-close">>,
[[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,1]]},
{instrument,5,<<"cowbell">>,
[[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]}],
tempo => 120.0}
5>
This looks about right. We now have the parser in 16 lines of code and can begin focusing on the next part, the renderer.
Rendering
For rendering, we need a couple of helper functions:
conv(Pat) -> [render_c(C) || C <- Pat].
render_c(0) -> $-;
render_c(1) -> $x.
These two functions are helpers which are going to be used to convert a pattern such a [0,0,1,0] into [45, 45, 120, 45] which are the ASCII bytes for “ — x-”. Again, we use a list comprehension to work over the list and converting each element in the list.
We also need to handle the tempo, and in the output, a floating point value such as 120.0 is to be rendered as an integer 120 with no trailing 0. There is no such function in Erlang by default, so we test if the result is close to 0 and then convert the output into an integer if that is the case:
format_float(F) ->
case abs(F - trunc(F)) of
K when K < 0.0001 -> integer_to_list(trunc(F));
_ -> float_to_list(F, [{decimals, 1}, compact])
end.
And now, we are ready for the rendering function. Before that however, I need to have another little intermezzo about iolists in Erlang.
The iolist() datatype is a way to output data in Erlang. It is an inductively generated datatype, where the type itself is part of the type. The specification is
-type iolist() :: list(0..255 | binary() | iolist()).
which one can read as “iolists are defined as lists consisting of 3 alternate things: integers in the range 0..255, binaries, and iolists themselves”. The last part makes the definition inductive such that iolists are really trees built out of lists. They are convenient because you can avoid having to explicitly concatenate strings in many situations. Say you want to quote a string, which can be done by writing the following function:
quote(String) -> [$", String, $"].
The notation $X evaluates to the ascii code for the symbol X. And this forms a quoted string without ever copying String. Since all terms in Erlang are persistent (immutable), no risk is had by this construction.
Many typical output points in Erlang programs accept iolists() as well as other data. Writing to a socket or file for instance. This is highly convenient as you often avoid having to manually concatenate data, but can just build up the iolist() structure and then have the system itself handle the concatenation later on. It also means the Erlang VM is free to optimize data output. For instance by pre-calculating the size needed for the concatenated target and by the use of the writev(2) system call to do “gather output” writing.
The render function of the drum machine decoder uses iolists(). It also employs another trick: each parsed element has a unique representation. Hence, we can simply analyse an element and then recurse deeper down into our abstract syntax tree. The render function always returns iolists() so we can “plug in” those into a larger iolist. The test function above then aptly uses the iolist_to_binary/1 function to convert the iolist into a binary we can use to test against the expected output.
render(#{ format := splice, tempo := Tempo,
instruments := Instruments, hardware_string := HWS}) ->
["Saved with HW Version: ", HWS, $
,
render({tempo, Tempo}), $
,
render(Instruments)];
render(List) when is_list(List) ->
[render(Elem) || Elem <- List];
render({tempo, T}) ->
["Tempo: ", format_float(T)];
render({instrument, N, Name, Pattern}) ->
Prefix = io_lib:format("(~B) ~s\t", [N, Name]),
Grid = render({pattern, Pattern}),
[Prefix, Grid, $
];
render({pattern, [P1, P2, P3, P4]}) ->
[$|, conv(P1), $|, conv(P2), $|, conv(P3), $|, conv(P4), $|].
This is all of the renderer. We pattern match on different possible inputs and then handle them by outputting something which is right for that input. Two tricks are being used to make discrimination explicit. Rendering of the tempo calls recursively with {tempo, Tempo} and pattern rendering calls recursively with {pattern, Pat}. This ensures each input term is unique and thus we can employ the same rendering function for all cases.
In languages with static type systems, such a function must often be broken into several different small functions. And it is also advisable to do so in Erlang had the rendering function been larger. For a renderer this small, however, it is fine to keep functions close to each other.

Notes
HOOVER, Ala. -- Kirby Smart brought up the quarterback battle nearly right off the bat at SEC Media Day knowing it would be at the forefront of most media members' minds.
The two Bulldog QBs most talked about: senior Grayson Lambert who threw nearly 2,000 yards last season, but was largely inconsistent and struggled with turnovers.
Then there's the kid: Jacob Eason. The fan favorite who had an inspiring spring game that showed he could have no problem taking over the team.

It won't be an easy decision, but it will not be one where emotion will cloud judgment with factors such as Lambert being a senior or Eason's inevitable fate of being the next star quarterback to play between the hedges.
Smart won't take any of that into account. His final decision won't even come down to who he thinks is the best quarterback. Rather, Smart clarified it will be the one that he believes has the opportunity to lead the team to the most victories.
"I don't know who that is. If I knew, I promise you, I would tell you," Smart said.

Before he knows, Smart has to evaluate his quarterbacks' improvement. Across the near month of practices before the Sept. 3 season opener against North Carolina, the former Alabama defensive coordinator wants to see who can take leadership of his team and who the team is most receptive with. Georgia's two top tailbacks are questionable for the start of the season while they recover from injury, so the poise of the man under center will be crucial to start the season.
Lambert had that chance and was under-whelming last season. But his experience with the team no doubt enables him to be a natural leader. That is, easier than it will be for Eason, who is just 18 and has a lot to learn coming straight out of high school.
That's a lot for a kid.
"I didn't know what to expect," tight-end Jeb Blazevich said on the early-enrolled quarterback. "He had a lot of pressure and a lot of attention on him. I kind of felt bad about him. He's obviously worked, he has an awesome arm. He's a really good guy, and I'm really excited to see him compete against Brice (Ramsey) and Grayson."
"Jacob has done a great job. He's come in and worked hard," center Brandon Klublano said. "Obviously, he's under a lot of scrutiny, but we feel like all three guys have done an amazing job, and we'll see how it goes during fall camp."
The popular belief seems to be that Lambert will get the start, but it will be Eason who takes over- possibly even in game one- and becomes the face of the Bulldogs.
"He'll pick Lambert, and he'll quickly get Eason in," ESPN radio show host Paul Finebaum predicted in an interview with 11Alive. "The fans just have to be patient. He will be the starting quarterback. He is the future of Georgia football. Someone said today Lambert did a great job.' Yeah, he did. He got Mark Richt fired, among other reasons."
Largely ignored from the conversation is junior Brice Ramsey who is in contention, but will be more likely seen behind the long snapper after discovering his punting skills last season.
So as the summer heats up, so will Georgia's quarterback battle. It could come down to a game-time decision come the season-opener against North Carolina.

Ancient Indian strategy board game
This article is about the game chaturanga. For the four-player version, played with dice, see chaturaji . For other uses, see Chaturanga (disambiguation)
This example uses algebraic notation.
Chaturanga (Sanskrit: चतुरङ्ग; caturaṅga), or catur for short, is an ancient Indian strategy game that is commonly theorized to be the common ancestor of the board games chess, shogi, sittuyin, makruk, xiangqi and janggi.[2]
Chaturanga developed in the Gupta Empire, India around the 6th century AD. In the 7th century, it was adopted as shatranj in Sassanid Persia, which in turn was the form of chess brought to late-medieval Europe.
The exact rules of chaturanga are unknown. Chess historians suppose that the game had similar rules to those of its successor, shatranj. In particular, there is uncertainty as to the moves of the Gaja (elephant).
History [ edit ]
Sanskrit caturaṅga is a bahuvrihi compound, meaning "having four limbs or parts" and in epic poetry often meaning "army".[3] The name comes from a battle formation mentioned in the Indian epic Mahabharata, referring to four divisions of an army, namely elephantry, chariotry, cavalry and infantry. An ancient battle formation, akshauhini, is like the setup of chaturanga.
Chaturanga was played on an 8×8 uncheckered board, called ashtāpada,[4] which is also the name of a game. The board sometimes had special markings, the meaning of which are unknown today. These marks were not related to chaturanga, but were drawn on the board only by tradition. Chess historian H. J. R. Murray conjectured that the ashtāpada was also used for some old race-type dice game, perhaps similar to chowka bhara, in which the marks had meaning.
An early reference to an ancient Indian board game is sometimes attributed to Subandhu in his Vasavadatta, dated between the 5th and 7th centuries AD:
The time of the rains played its game with frogs for pieces [nayadyutair] yellow and green in colour, as if mottled by lac, leapt up on the black field squares.
The colours are not those of the two camps, but mean that the frogs have two colours, yellow and green.
Banabhatta's Harsha Charitha (c. AD 625) contains the earliest reference to the name chaturanga:
Under this monarch, only the bees quarrelled to collect the dew; the only feet cut off were those of measurements, and only from Ashtâpada one could learn how to draw up a chaturanga, there was no cutting-off of the four limbs of condemned criminals...
While there is little doubt that ashtâpada is the gameboard of 8×8 squares, the double meaning of chaturanga, as the four-folded army, may be controversial. There is a probability that the ancestor of chess was mentioned there.[clarification needed]
The game was first introduced to the West in Thomas Hyde's De ludis orientalibus libri duo, published in 1694. Subsequently, translations of Sanskrit accounts of the game were published by Sir William Jones.[5]
In Arabic, most of the terminology of chess is derived directly from chaturanga: Modern chess itself is called chitranj in Arabic, and the bishop is called the elephant.
Rules [ edit ]
The initial position is as shown. White moves first. The objective in chaturanga, the same as modern chess, is to checkmate the opponent's Raja (king).
Pieces and their moves [ edit ]
Chaturanga pieces Images Name Raja (king) Mantri or Senapati (counselor or general; ancestor of ferz; early form of queen) Ratha (chariot; rook) Gaja (elephant; later called fil; early form of bishop) Ashva (horse; knight) Padàti or Bhata (foot-soldier or infantry; pawn)
Raja (king) (also spelled Rajah ): moves one step in any direction (vertical, horizontal or diagonal), the same as the king in chess. There is no castling in chaturanga.
(king) (also spelled ): moves one step in any direction (vertical, horizontal or diagonal), the same as the king in chess. There is no castling in chaturanga. Mantri (minister or counsellor); also known as Senapati (general): moves one step diagonally in any direction, like the fers in shatranj.
(minister or counsellor); also known as (general): moves one step diagonally in any direction, like the in shatranj. Ratha (chariot) (also known as Śakata ): moves the same as a rook in chess- whereby the rook moves horizontally or vertically, through any number of unoccupied squares.
(chariot) (also known as ): moves the same as a rook in chess- whereby the rook moves horizontally or vertically, through any number of unoccupied squares. Gaja (elephant) (also known as Hastin ): three different moves are described in ancient literature: Two squares in any diagonal direction, jumping over the first square, as the alfil in shatranj. This is a fairy chess piece that is a (2,2)-leaper. The same move is used for the boat in chaturaji, a four-player version of chaturangam. [6] The elephant in xiangqi has the same move, but without jumping. One step forward or one step in any diagonal direction. The same move is used for the khon (nobleman) in makruk (Thai chess) and the sin (elephant) in sittuyin (Burmese chess), as well as for the silver general in shogi. The move was described c. 1030 by Biruni in his book India . Two squares in any orthogonal (vertical or horizontal) direction, jumping over the first square. A piece with such a move is called a dabbābah [7] in some chess variants. The move was described by the Arabic chess master al-Adli [8] c. 840 in his (partly lost) chess work. (The Arabic word dabbābah in former times meant a covered siege engine for attacking walled fortifications; today it means "army tank".) The German historian Johannes Kohtz (1843–1918) suggests, rather, that this was the earliest move of the Ratha.
(elephant) (also known as ): three different moves are described in ancient literature: Ashva (horse) (also spelled Ashwa or Asva ): moves the same as a knight in chess.
(horse) (also spelled or ): moves the same as a knight in chess. Padàti or Bhata (foot-soldier or infantry) (also spelled Pedati); also known as Sainik (warrior): moves and captures the same as a pawn in chess, but without a double-step option on the first move.[9]
Additional rules [ edit ]
Al-Adli mentions two further differences:
Stalemate was a win for a stalemated player. This rule appeared again in some medieval chess variants in England c. 1600. According to some sources, there was no stalemate, though this is improbable.
The player that is first to bare the opponent's king (i.e. capture all enemy pieces except the king) wins. In shatranj this is also a win, but only if the opponent cannot bare the player's king on his next turn.

Also that year, Grand Theft Auto IV was released, selling 25 million copies. In 2009, Minecraft became to game to play with sales of 54 million console units. Notably, social media was a significant part of this game's rise to fame, with ⅓ of players learning about the game from online videos. In 2009, Wii Sports Resort was released, selling 32.8 million copies, and New Super Mario Bros. Wii came out, selling 29.32 million copies.
2010s
In 2010, Call of Duty: Black Ops debuted, selling a total of 26.2 million copies. Breaking all records, this game sold more than 5.6 million copies in the first 24 hours.

Biggest Flops in Video Games
1980s
In 1982, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial was released and 1.5 million units were sold. Unfortunately, between 2.5 million and 3.5 million cartridges went unsold.
1990s
Virtual Boy was the first instance of 3D graphics in video games. Nintendo hyped a virtual reality experience for the 1995 release, but its monochrome graphics did not deliver. Only 770,000 units were sold.
After nearly a decade of hype and a seven-year development process with repeated delays, the game Battlecruiser 3000AD (shortened BC3K) was released in 1996 with many technical problems and outdated graphics.
After spending $6 million on a five-year development process, The Last Express, recognized as an intelligently written game with well-developed characters, was a sales flop after its 1997 release because of a lack of marketing and promotion. The maker needed to sell more than a million copies to break even and only sold 100,000.
Creating Dominion: Storm Over Gift 3 was supposed to be a three-month project for two employees, but it took more than a year to develop, and the game went wildly over budget prior to its 1998 release.
Shenmue had a five-year production period that cost $70 million, ranking the game as a record setter for the most expensive production costs at that time. Only 1.2 million copies were sold after its 1999 release.
2000s
Debuted in 2000, Daikatana was marketed as the “next big thing” for first-person shooter games, but massive overspending and a delayed release eventually resulted in a poor reaction, including complaints of technical bugs and low production value.
Although the game Beyond Good & Evil was critically acclaimed, its failure was attributed to its 2003 release alongside competing titles.
Despite critical success, the low initial sales of the 2005 game Psychonauts (fewer than 100,000 copies) was blamed on a lack of marketing.
The action-adventure game Ōkami was set in ancient Japan and combined traditional myths and folklore. Despite critical acclaim at its 2006 release, it was met with slow sales.
Themed with heavy-metal music, the game Brütal Legend recorded low sales after its 2009 release because of real-time strategy elements that were not mentioned before the game's debut.
2010s
After the release of APB: All Points Bulletin in 2010, unenthusiastic reviews and a low subscriber rate were the cause of this game's commercial failure.
The 2011 game Duke Nukem Forever was in development for 15 years and cost company executives $20 to $30 million of their own money, only to be met with poor sales.
In 2014, Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric and Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal were released, selling only 490,000 copies because of weak writing, glitches and poor gameplay.
The game Sunset, released in 2015, used an “arthouse-style” approach and sold only 4,000 copies, including those distributed to its crowdfunding backers.

As integral to London life as it is iconic, the Tube has been in operation since 1863. In its more than 150 years, it has grown immensely: today, trains travel 47.3 million miles (76.2 million kilometres) and carry 1.265 billion passengers each year. The busiest station, Waterloo, sees 89.4 million passengers a year. That's more than 10 times the city's population.
Such a massive network, of course, requires a massive amount of work – not only to build, but to operate and maintain each day. The Tube drivers are on the front lines, responsible for ensuring that those 1.265 billion trips go safely each year.
But what exactly does a Tube driver do? What does their day look like? To find out, we persuaded Transport for London (TFL) to let us do something a little unusual: we attached a GoPro to the middle window of the driver's cab – and to the driver's chest – for the length of the Piccadilly Line from Heathrow to Cockfosters. The 44-mile (71km) line, which has 53 stations, takes about 1.5 hours to complete.
For those used to hearing that planes have become so computerised they practically fly themselves, a Tube train driver seems relatively hands-on. The main controls on the console include the all-important ‘dead man's handle', which must be manually held in order for the train to move. When the handle isn't depressed for 60 seconds, if for example the driver is incapacitated, an alarm sounds; after two minutes, the system's control room is alerted.
Drivers control the Tube train's speed, too. And they have to be careful, as there are speed limits. The maximum speed on the Piccadilly line is 45mph (72km/h). As the train approaches the end of the line, that limit creeps all the way down to 10mph (16km/h). When pulling into a platform, experience and training on their particular line is how drivers know where to start braking – but a sign at the end of every platform, showing the driver exactly where to stop, helps, too. And instead of one, there are two braking systems. One works with friction. The other is rheostatic, meaning that the motors' electrical energy – which dissipates as heat – is cooled via a ‘braking grid', a system of resistors on board which are protected with large cooling fans.
What about the passenger doors? Out-of-town tourists accustomed to automatic doors that sense obstruction and don't shut, like elevators, often are surprised by the how firmly a Tube's doors snap closed – even if a purse or backpack is trapped inside. But that system isn't fully automated. Instead, at every stop, the driver uses CCTV or mirrors on the platforms to check that it's safe to close the doors. Once they close, they do keep closing, although there is a bit of ‘give' in case something is caught. That's why there are the multiple announcements to ‘mind the closing doors' and warning beeps.
If it sounds like the kind of work that could get tiring, it is. That's why a Tube train driver is only allowed to work up to four hours 15 minutes at a time, and then must take a break.

Police have delivered a dramatic account of drunken excess in the party centre of Courtenay Place to the Wellington City Council.
Photo: Wiki Commons
Councillors were told of arrests for fighting and assaults, as well as people passing out alone in freezing conditions.
But they got a conflicting account from the hospitality industry, which argued the dangers were exaggerated.
The meeting came in the wake of a failed attempt last year to reform central Wellington drinking laws, and councillors were working on a new policy.
The briefing started with Wellington city area commander Chris Bensemann describing a patrol last Saturday in Courtenay Place, Wellington's party centre.
The inspector was accompanying his officers and did not like what they found.
"We would have dealt with probably up to a dozen fights and assaults," he said.
"In addition, 10 people were extremely intoxicated."
Inspector Bensemann then described one case where a young woman was found in what he described as a risky situation.
"She was found at the bottom of Blair Street in a doorway," he said.
"She would have been 18. It was extremely cold on Saturday night as we all know.
"She had become isolated from her friends, was extremely intoxicated and was falling asleep.
"All she had on was a slip. I hate to think what would have happened if she had not been found."
The hospitality industry then weighed in, with Robert Brewer of Spirits New Zealand telling councillors that drinking was becoming less of a problem, not more.
"Hazardous drinking especially by young people is coming down and has done for some time.
"Overall we are all consuming less alcohol and in fact over the last 10 to 15 years the amount of alcohol available for New Zealanders over 18 has reduced by 25 percent."
Jeremy Smith of the Hospitality Association told councillors bar owners were taking their responsibility seriously.
"People wanting to get into venues know they are not going to get past the doorman if they are intoxicated.
"People know that if you want to go out and get into a bar you have to be well behaved. We found inside bars people are better behaved, they are more aware of their friends' behaviour and they do not kick up a fuss if you say listen mate, you have had enough it is time to go."
These comments will not change policy but will be used by councillors to help develop new rules on alcohol in the central city.
A previous attempt to develop a policy was shot down in legal flames last year and the council is basically starting again.
There have been a lot of articles in the news recently about “fat genes,” and their affect on the body's ability to fight off obesity. If you blame your genes for your weight issues, it may be time to reconsider. A new study sheds light on how exercise can still be extremely effective, regardless of genetics.
The study shows that exercise, despite the genetic coding of an individual, will always work to fight against fat and prevent weight gain. Researchers in Great Britain tracked the physical activity 20,430 people, and studied the 12 genetic variants that have been linked to an increased risk of obesity.
They looked at the genetic coding of participants, and made a determination as to whether or not a physically active lifestyle could help to reduce or override the genetic influence of the fat genes. What they found was that exercise certainly can override such a genetic tendency, and it doesn't require very much of it. Exercise can help reduce the genetic tendency towards obesity by 40%, the study found.
The other numerous benefits of exercise are also extremely well documented, with increase physical activity leading to cancer prevention, improved total health, decreased anxiety, and much more.
“Our findings challenge the popular myth that obesity is unavoidable if it runs in the family,” says senior researcher Ruth Loos of Great Britain's Medical Research Council in Cambridge.
“Is one of the goals here mass deportation?” a reporter asked Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, on Tuesday, trying to get some clarification on just how broad the scope of President Donald Trump's executive orders on immigration enforcement might be. Two implementation memorandums that the Department of Homeland Security had issued earlier in the day suggested that the breadth might be stunning, indeed. But Spicer didn't see it that way. “No,” he replied, with a half-puzzled look, as though he were surprised that anyone might worry, for a moment, about how Trump might change not only the lives of the undocumented but also the lives of their family members and neighbors, and even the mission of law enforcement in this country.
“Not at all?” the reporter asked.
Spicer said that the press just wasn't seeing the big picture. "What we have to get back to is understanding a couple of things,” he said, foremost among them being that the White House shouldn't be choosing which people it would deport for violating immigration laws and which it would not. That reply, though, suggests that the correct answer to the reporter's first question was “yes” or, at best, “maybe, eventually.” The status quo has involved setting priorities about whom to deport. There are so many undocumented people in the United States that there either have to be such priorities, or else a large scale refocussing toward mass deportation and, most likely, a far greater and more intrusive role for law enforcement in the lives of the documented and undocumented alike. Under the Obama Administration, the priority was people who had been convicted of dangerous crimes. The Trump executive order starts with the idea that criminal aliens are the problem, but then widens the definition of criminality and blurs its edges. The relevant passage in the D.H.S. memorandums on who will be a priority for deportation points to any undocumented people who:
(a) have been convicted of any criminal offense; (b) have been charged with any criminal offense that has not been resolved; (c) have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense; (d) have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency; (e) have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits; (f) are subject to a final order of removal but have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United States; or (g) in the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.
It is not just that you can be charged, but not convicted, and still be judged a danger. You can “otherwise” pose a risk, in the subjective judgment of an immigration officer—whose ultimate boss, the President, has made alarming and bigoted statements about the kind of people he regards as hazards. As is the case so often under Trump, “criminal” seems to mean almost anyone whom he or his supporters regard as frightening.
The vagueness of the provisions about misrepresentation before governmental agencies and having “abused” public benefits also raises the possibility that the executive orders will make families with one or more undocumented member less willing to seek all the services that they can for their children, who may be American citizens themselves. It is an injunction to live in the shadows. (President Trump has not yet repealed President Obama's DACA order, protecting certain people brought here as children, and he claims to be conflicted about it, but there are indications that some revision, at least, is coming.) Spicer, like other members of the Trump Administration, also elided the question of whether the crime in question might simply be one's presence in America, in violation of immigration laws. When asked, he talked about how the “No. 1 priority” was “people who pose a threat to this country,” but then reiterated that there ought to be no turning of a blind eye to violations of immigration laws, reminding reporters that “everybody who is here illegally is subject to removal at any time.” This is a mandate for, if not mass deportation, then mass uncertainty and fear. (It is telling that a D.H.S. official, speaking to reporters, advised against “panic.”)
And how would all those deportations be accomplished? The new orders also foresee a “surge” that would involve the hiring of thousands more immigration officers and judges; expedited deportation in many more cases (not just those of people apprehended near the border, newly arrived in the country, but of people who have been anywhere in America for as long as two years); and more plans for a wall, among other things. It also includes an effort to enlist local police officers in deportation efforts, something likely not only to damage community relations but to lead to an underreporting of crimes. How would a parent choose between reporting an act of violence against herself, which might result in a police officer asking for her papers, and possibly being separated from her family? Spicer spoke of taking the “shackles” off immigration enforcers, as if Obama had oppressed them. The orders and memorandums also envision many more immigration detention centers. They also remove privacy-law protections for undocumented people, a measure that would inevitably compromise the privacy of their American-citizen relatives and friends as well.
The guidance from the Department of Homeland Security comes at a time when the country is waiting for President Trump to issue yet another executive order related to who can be in America. This would be, effectively, the second draft of an order banning people from seven Muslim-majority countries and all refugees. The original version has been suspended, thanks to a temporary restraining order issued by a judge in Seattle, which was upheld by a three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit, and is the subject of continuing legislation. One problem those judges saw with the order also appears to be present in the new orders on immigration enforcement: statements from the Trump Administration that dismissed concerns about the orders' reach. In the case of the seven-country ban, for example, there had been a great deal of obfuscation about whether it would apply to green-card holders. (The text suggests that it does.) In the case of these orders, there is the large and lurking idea that immigrants in general are dangerous, even murderous threats—stealing jobs, stealing lives, the explanation for all that is wrong—and that if that danger is not manifest today, it will be tomorrow. When Trump sets “priorities,” he does so like a bully, trying to find who is weakest and least protected. The question is whether the neighbors of the undocumented will stand up for them, or look away.
There is perhaps no idea this blog has litigated against more fiercely than the idea of low-end disruption and the inevitable doom of the iPhone. It's hard to imagine now, but when I started Stratechery in 2013, conventional wisdom held that Apple had peaked as Android devices became increasingly “good enough” and half the price to boot, all thanks to their modularity. The integrated iPhone would soon have to lower prices or start an inevitable decline – most likely both. In fact, though, this past quarter the iPhone not only grew tremendously on a unit basis, but the average selling price went up by an incredible $50.
To be perfectly honest, as much as I would like to claim I predicted this growth, my previous treatises – most notably, What Clayton Christensen Got Wrong – were more concerned with arguing that the iPhone would not collapse, an endgame that Christensen seems to still believe in. From an interview last fall with Business Insider:
In the early years of an industry's life, almost always the dominant products are proprietary and interdependent in their architecture. In the smartphone world, the first one was Nokia — excruciatingly interdependent architecture — then RIM, which was an even more excruciatingly interdependent architecture, and then Apple. And Apple was kind of halfway. Inside of the device, it's proprietary, but it initiated the modularity in that you could develop apps and stick them in. But then just like IBM identified modularity with the PC, Google gave us Android. And now I think the Android operating system as a platform, modularity, accounts for about 90% of the units, even while Apple makes all of the profit. So if Apple keeps its strategy of very high prices, their share of that market will diminish. And so ultimately they'll make a lot of profit on 100 units. And Samsung, if they win, they will be making all of the units in the industry but no profit. Either way you're screwed, but that's the theory behind why I said Apple won't succeed, because in the end modularity always wins.
My objection to this line of argument has been that Christensen's model only applies to business-to-business markets where the buyer is not the user; in consumer markets, on the other hand, markets are not monolithic, and some segment of the market cares about and is willing to pay for aspects of the user experience that can't be measured but can only be delivered through an integrated experience.
I do still think this critique holds, but I also believe there are three additional factors to consider:
The iPhone – and all of modern Apple's products – is far more modular than it appears. It's critical to understand where Apple has integrated, and why
– is far more modular than it appears. It's critical to understand where Apple has integrated, and why Apple is creating an entirely new class of services that mix integration and modularization
The market in which the iPhone is competing is unimaginably large – far larger, in fact, than the smartphone market
I'll explore each of these in turn, and explain why Apple is extremely well-placed to not just preserve its position, but to in fact continue its growth.
The iPhone is a Mix of Integration and Modularity
I am always confused when discussions about integration and modularity are reduced to questions about who makes the operating system. After all, the idea of integration and modularity have traditionally been concerned with industrial production and supply chains. Henry Ford, for example, in order to meet demand for his Model T, vertically integrated to the point where the company owned rubber plantations in Brazil to provide the raw material for tires; General Motors in part upstaged Ford through a more modular approach that allowed for more customization and differing levels of quality.
From this perspective – the hardware perspective – the iPhone is quite modular. Apple has 785 different suppliers, and while not all of them contribute to the iPhone, the vast majority do, making everything from screws to memory to camera lens assemblies. In fact, while I don't know how many suppliers are in the Samsung supply chain, I'd wager it's fewer than the iPhone's, simply because Samsung itself is a component manufacturer. In other words, from a pure hardware perspective, it is Samsung that is more integrated than Apple.
The glaring exception, of course, is the A-series of Systems-on-Chip first introduced with the iPad back in 2010. In retrospect, though, this is the exception that proves the rule: it is in the design of the processor that Apple can best take advantage of the fact they make the software that runs on that chip, improving performance, battery life, and enabling key technologies like Touch ID. These are factors that are directly experienced by the customer (and, in the case of Touch ID, quite literally touched); that is where Apple integrates.
On the software side, Christensen is exactly right that the iPhone is modular by virtue of the App Store. Apps are the components of the iPhone software experience (and sadly for developers, similarly commoditized); even there, though, Apple controls as many of the customer experience points as possible, both through the App Store and App Review. It's a similar arrangement to the iTunes Store (albeit without the review): effectively unlimited selection in an Apple-controlled wrapper.
The result is that the iPhone stack looks something like this:
Hundreds of components, millions of apps, and tens of millions of songs and videos, all wrapped in an Apple-controlled experience.
Redefining Services
Absent in my drawing of the iPhone stack was iCloud, a surprising omission given that Tim Cook has started referring to Apple's ability to integrate not just hardware and software, but services as well.
In fact, I think that iCloud is the least interesting – and least important – aspect of Apple's services offering, and I think the company agrees. Notice how much of iCloud's functionality is becoming less differentiated, not more: iCloud Core Data, which sought to integrate iCloud into Apple's data API, has been abandoned in favor of CloudKit, a rather generic offering similar to what a developer might get from AWS or Microsoft Azure. Similarly, iCloud Drive isn't really any different from Dropbox – the per-application integration is gone.
Moreover, you don't really need to use iCloud to get a full iPhone experience; you can manage your email, contacts, and calendar with Google or Microsoft, and most major apps like Facebook or Twitter are simply interfaces for their company's cloud application. True, iCloud can do things like “Find my iPhone”, but iCloud is by no means a reason to be particularly optimistic about the iPhone's long-run prognosis.
The problem is this narrow definition of services, something I first tackled in Xiaomi's Ambition:
There's come to be a bit of a cliché when it comes to writing about Xiaomi…They sell smartphones at cost, or close to it, and will make money through services. The trouble with a lot of this commentary surrounding Xiaomi1 comes in determining exactly what those “services” are. The easy assumption are traditional Internet services like those offered by Google, including an app store, online portals, so on and so forth. That, though, hardly validates a $45 billion valuation… Instead, the way to understand Xiaomi and why exactly they are so valuable is to more deeply understand what Lei Jun means by “services”, and, in the end, why Xiaomi actually is a lot like Apple after all.
In that piece I concluded that Xiaomi was seeking to create an entire ecosystem around the home; true, the smartphone margins may be thin, but by integrating everything from air purifiers to wearables to TVs into MiUI, the Xiaomi smartphone layer, Xiaomi would both increase stickiness for their smartphones and make a lot of money selling to an entire generation entering both the middle class economically and their own homes physically.
Apple, though, is making the exact same play, but with an even broader ambition: they want the iPhone to be an essential part of not just your home but nearly every aspect of your life, and for that the company is building five foundational services:
HomeKit is Apple's solution to the Internet of Things, and given both the disposable income and strong preferences of Apple customers, I expect Apple to get more traction here than just about anyone else (Xiaomi is an exception, largely because they are building – or funding companies to build – everything themselves). Everything in your house, controlled by your iPhone
CarPlay is self-explanatory: Americans especially spend a lot of time commuting, and Apple is attempting to make your iPhone the center of your experience in the car
Apple Pay is for the world at large; most of our interactions outside of the home are predicated on money changing hands, and Apple Pay is seeking to be the default mechanism. I'm bullish on its chances
Siri is for information and everything in the cloud: through your iPhone you can find out the answer to anything, just by asking
Finally, HealthKit is perhaps the most profound, because it is about interacting with and tracking your own body. A service doesn't get much more sticky than that
These five services extend the iPhone's importance to your daily life in nearly every dimension:
Note, though, that each of these services follows a similar model to the one Apple uses for the iPhone itself: Apple isn't creating the furniture for HomeKit, the cars for CarPlay, the banks or retailers for Apple Pay, or information services for Siri. Instead they are leaving that up to the market in a modular fashion; the only integration is the actual interaction between the Apple layer and your iPhone.
To be sure, Apple's success in each of these areas is by no means assured, particularly Siri where Apple is competing with Google. The iPhone, though, is Apple's trump card, as Cook explained at yesterday's Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference:
We've taken iOS and we've extended it into your car, your home, into your health. All of these are really critical parts of your life and none of us want to have different platforms in different parts of our lives. We want one seamless kind of life. I think that's huge for our future. It's not every day you can plant that many foundational technologies.
Apple's New Market
Christensen has previously explained that he got the iPhone wrong because it was disruptive to laptops, not cell phones. This, though, doesn't particularly make sense given that the worldwide smartphone market vastly dwarfs laptops, and that while PCs aren't growing, they still very much exist. Instead, as I argued in Obsoletive, the iPhone made the old idea of a cellphone obsolete: it was just another app on a computer that fit in your pocket.
The implications of this are even more profound than the fact nearly every person on planet earth will soon have a smartphone. Recall how Steve Jobs, after describing how a human on a bicycle is more efficient than even a condor, characterized computers:
We humans are tool builders and we can fashion tools that amplify these abilities that we have to spectacular magnitudes. And so for me a computer has always been a bicycle for the mind.
That bicycle is now with us every where we go; what Apple is building are new paths.
In that respect, suppose Christensen is right: maybe in the long run everything Apple does will be modularized. However, if modularization wins in a mature market, that means – as Christensen says – that integration wins in a new one. And a new market is exactly where the iPhone is headed: Apple is on the verge of leaving the narrowly-defined smartphone market behind entirely, instead making a play to be involved in every aspect of its consumers' lives. And, if the importance of an integrated experience matter more with your phone than your PC, because you use it more, how much more important is an integrated experience that touches every detail of your life?

Hey guys! The goal is not so far away, even 3 days in!
Thanks so much for jumping on board with this! I know it's all been all a bit ridiculous and some of you may even believe the 'game' I am planning is a joke of some kind.
Well, in some ways it was, but in others I have EVERY intention of making an awesome game :)
As a Statement of Intent I am now creating the demo that I promised. This demo will be a sample of the sort of experience you can expect from the full game.
Your goal in the demo is to find the money required to go to Oculus Connect. Pretty meta, right? How you do that? Well, I guess you'll have to play to find out.
However it will require a special tool: An Oculus Rift DK2.
For those getting their DK2 the next week or so, you will be able to step into the Demo where you will then discover a DK2, which you will then require to step into another world. There... you will find another DK2 and... well... look it's going to get a bit surreal. Seriously messed up.
Dawson's Creek messed up.
In the spirit of sharing, here is a little WORK IN PROGRESS of the game's setting. It looks pretty innocuous right now, sure, but when you're 5 levels down in some twisty VR rabbit hole... well... let's just say I don't wanna wait for our lives to be over.
Attorney General Eric Holder asserted that the Justice Department was not finished with the shooting of Michael Brown, after the grand jury in Ferguson did not indict Officer Darren Wilson.
“While the grand jury proceeding in St. Louis County has concluded, the Justice Department's investigation into the shooting of Michael Brown remains ongoing,” he said in a statement. Holder added that the department would continue to “investigate allegations of unconstitutional policing patterns or practices by the Ferguson Police Department.”
Holder called for peace in the streets of Ferguson, but acknowledged the deep distrust of law enforcement officials in the black community.
“This incident has sparked a national conversation about the need to ensure confidence between law enforcement and the communities they protect and serve. While constructive efforts are underway in Ferguson and communities nationwide, far more must be done to create enduring trust,” he said.
Holder called for protesters to remain peaceful, even though they were angry at the verdict.
“Though there will be disagreement with the grand jury's decision not to indict, this feeling should not lead to violence,” he said.
He also called for police forces to show restraint in their policing of the community throughout the night.
“In the coming days, it will likewise be important for local law enforcement authorities to respect the rights of demonstrators and deescalate tensions by avoiding excessive displays–and uses–of force,” he said.

"Money and power, in the service of money and power", has become the template upon which our human experience is built.
This is at once both obvious, and, in need of some clarification.
- Advertisement -
What is obvious today is that the multi-national corporations, and the politicians who serve them (along with the mainstream media, think-tanks and a host of unelected advisory and regulatory entities) together form the power structure that, virtually unopposed, shapes our lives.
It is further obvious that this corporatist structure is the source of the vast sums of money -- the enabling mechanism -- that now powers the policies and politics of our so-called democracy. - Advertisement -
It should also be obvious that the corporatist ethos now dominates every almost facet of our society and culture.
And I hope its obvious that today's pay-for-play politics is, in reality, a self-perpetuating and self-reinforcing feedback loop, the negative outcomes of which we seem unable to escape.
Less clear, though, is how this situation came about, and what might be done to change it. - Advertisement -
The history of mankind is the struggle for power -- the power to rule and to dominate -- by emperors and kings, and despots and tyrants. The great events of history have arisen out of this struggle, in which the initial chaos and upheaval later gave way to a productive equilibrium. But at all times, the same tectonic forces were building toward the next seismic shift.
More recently, as we began to imagine ourselves as civilized, having learned the lessons of distant history, we re-discovered the philosophies of the ancients. It is from them the liberal revolutions of the Enlightenment shaped the early traditions of democracy, and the notion of "consent of the governed".
And today, kings have been replaced by prime ministers, dictators by presidents. But the struggle for power remains, and our consent is now mostly manufactured. The great liberal traditions that infused our founding documents in North America are being rapidly swept away. The age-old desire to dominate still persists, and more than just natural resources are at stake -- after all, the minds and will of the people are the greatest prize, are they not?
This struggle for power simply reflects the tension that has always existed between the rich few and the poor many. It is a tension that is unlikely to disappear anytime soon.
Between the polar opposites -- government for the benefit of the rich, and government for the benefit of the poor -- is the middle way with which we are most familiar, a liberal democracy supported by a strong middle class. However, as is increasingly clear from all manner of reports, the middle class in the US and Canada is under grave assault, and the gap between rich and poor is unprecedented.
In his book, Death of the Liberal Class, Chris Hedges describes how the central institutions of our liberal democracy have been co-opted as part of this assault on the middle class. This diminution of the moderating force between rich and poor has allowed the elites to retake much of the hard-won gains of the liberal revolutions.
The institutions that comprise the liberal class, and the strong middle class that sustains it, perform a very specific function in a liberal democracy, in that it provides a safety valve through which dissent and reform are possible. But when, as Hedges suggests, that safety valve is removed, discontent cannot be adequately expressed, and incremental reforms become impossible. In the absence of change mechanisms that offer even the faintest of hope for greater equality, radical social movements (as we are now seeing) can arise.
The dramatic shift away from liberal democracy in North America is generally attributed to the rise of right-wing forces inside the Republican Party in America and, more recently, the new Conservative Party in Canada. Whatever their individual goals and aspirations might be, the potent mix of neoliberal, neoconservative, corporatist and Christian Right ideologies has coalesced to serve very well the interests of the wealthy few over the needs of the many poor.
How has this been accomplished? By what sleight-of-hand has the great liberal revolution been rolled back? It is a continuing source of amazement that today the great mass of citizens have no idea how completely they are manipulated to endorse policies through the "democratic process" that are in direct opposition to their own best interests.

Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the last known American POW, was freed after five years in captivity — an ordeal that began and ended in Afghanistan under a shroud of mystery.
The Taliban turned over Bergdahl Saturday morning to US special forces in exchange for five notorious Islamic militants who had been held at Guantanamo Bay and will be sent to Qatar, where they will stay for a year under the terms of the trade.
At least one of the prisoners, ranking Taliban leader Khairullah Khairkhwa, had direct ties to Osama bin Laden.
Bergdahl was picked up by helicopter in western Afghanistan, near the Pakistan border.
After climbing aboard, the 28-year-old Idahoan, trying to communicate with his rescuers over the roar of the rotors, scrawled “SF?” on a paper plate — asking his rescuers whether they were special forces.
“Yes,” one of the men shouted. “We've been looking for you for a long time.”
The Army infantryman — himself nicknamed “SF” by his comrades for his gung-ho interest in special-forces tactics — began to weep.
Bergdahl's parents, who had lobbied continuously for his ­release, had not seen him by Saturday night, but intimated that he faces an arduous recovery from his ordeal.
Bergdahl is speaking in what appears to be Pashto, said his dad, Bob Bergdahl. It was not clear whether his son can still even speak English, Bob said.
When the father spoke to his son — for the first time in five worried years — it was to say both in Pashto and English, “I am your father, Bowe.”
“We will continue to stay strong for Bowe while he recovers,” said his mom, Jani.
The search for Bergdahl began soon after he went missing on June 30, 2009, in the same rugged wilds of southeastern Afghanistan where NFL player-turned-Army Ranger Pat Tillman was killed.
Bergdahl's mysterious disappearance from the small military outpost there and the subsequent revelation that he was in enemy hands prompted questions that still linger.
When the father spoke to his son — for the first time in five worried years — it was to say both in Pashto and English, ‘I am your father, Bowe.'
Soon after the capture, Taliban commander Mulvi Sangeen claimed a drunken Bergdahl was snatched while he stumbled to his car in the Yousaf Khel district of Paktika.
The US military called that a lie, and in one of the videos taken during his captivity, Bergdahl himself said he was captured while lagging behind a patrol.
But in the weeks before his capture, Bergdahl had made murky statements that suggested he was gravitating away from the soldiers in his unit and toward ­desertion, a member of his platoon told Rolling Stone.
“He spent more time with the Afghans than he did with his platoon,” former Spc. Jason Fry told the magazine in 2012.
As a teen, the home-schooled son of Calvinists took up ballet — recruited to be a “lifter” by “a beautiful local girl,” Rolling Stone reported, “the guy who holds the girl aloft in a ballet sequence.” The strategy worked: Bergdahl — who also began dabbling in Budd­hism and tarot card reading — soon moved in with the woman.
Even as a teen, he could fire a .22-caliber rifle with precision.
At age 20, he traveled to Paris and started learning French in hopes of joining the French Foreign Legion.
His application was rejected, and he was devastated, the magazine reported.
Bergdahl would drift for years, working mainly at a coffee shop near home. He briefly considered moving to Uganda to help villagers being terrorized by militias before deciding on a different ­adventure.
“I'm thinking of joining the Army,” he told his folks after ­already having signed up.
Bergdahl's dream was to help Afghan villagers rebuild their lives and learn to defend themselves, his dad told the magazine.
“The whole ‘COIN' thing,” Bob explained, referring to America's strategy of counter-insurgency. “We were given a fictitious picture, an artificially created picture of what we were doing in ­Afghanistan,” the dad said.
Bowe Bergdahl would detail his disillusionment with the Afghanistan campaign in an email to his parents three days before he went missing.
“I am sorry for everything here,” he wrote. “These people need help, yet what they get is the most conceited country in the world telling them that they are nothing and that they are stupid.”
Bergdahl also complained about fellow soldiers. The battalion commander was a “conceited old fool,” he said, and the only “decent” sergeants, planning to leave the platoon “as soon as they can,” told the privates — Bergdahl then among them — “to do the same.”
“I am ashamed to be an American. And the title of US soldier is just the lie of fools,” he concluded. “I am sorry for everything. The horror that is America is disgusting.”
Bob Bergdahl responded in an email: “OBEY YOUR CONSCIENCE!”
One night, after finishing a guard-duty shift, Bowe Bergdahl asked his team leader whether there would be a problem if he left camp with his rifle and night-vision goggles — to which the team leader replied “yes.”
Bergdahl then returned to his bunker, picked up a knife, water, his diary and a camera, and left camp, according to Rolling Stone.
The next morning, he was reported missing, and later that day, a drone and four fighter jets ­began to search for him.
Weeks of searching turned into months. The military pushed his parents and fellow soldiers to sign nondisclosure agreements. But before everyone signed, a comrade from his unit publicly called on Facebook for Bergdahl's execution as a deserter.
Propaganda videos of his captivity — which featured Bergdahl denouncing American foreign policy — were released.
At least once, in 2011, the prisoner, looking more haggard, fought back and tried to escape.
“He fought like a boxer,” a Taliban fighter told Newsweek.
Why Bergdahl was captured in the first place remained a mystery by the time high-level US government talks began in 2012 regarding a trade for his release.
“Frankly, we don't give a s–t why he left,” one White House official said at the time. “He's an American soldier. We want to bring him home.”
There was fierce debate over exchanging him for the five Taliban combatants. Sen. John McCain, himself a former POW, once described the five as “the five biggest murderers in world history,” according to Rolling Stone.
Mohammed Nabi served as chief of security for the Taliban in Qalat, Afghanistan, and later worked as a radio operator for the Taliban's communications office in Kabul. Department of Defense Abdul Haq Wasiq served as the Taliban's deputy minister of intelligence. Department of Defense Mullah Norullah Nori was a senior Taliban commander in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif when the Taliban fought US forces in late 2001. Department of Defense Khairullah Khairkhwa served in various Taliban positions including interior minister and had direct ties to Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden. Department of Defense Human Rights Watch says Mohammad Fazl could be prosecuted for war crimes for presiding over the mass killing of Shiite Muslims in Afghanistan in 2000 and 2001 as the Taliban sought to consolidate their control over the country.

Car Seat Headrest's Will Toledo has shared a cover of Radiohead's Amnesiac staple "Pyramid Song." He uploaded the lo-fi recording to Tumblr last week, describing it as "sloppy flamenco with missing string and AIM accompaniment." Check it out below. Teens of Denial, Toledo's latest Car Seat Headrest album, is out May 20 via Matador. So far, he's shared "Vincent," "Drunk Drivers/Killer Whales," and "Fill in the Blank" from the upcoming LP. Meanwhile, Radiohead are plotting their latest album, which a partner in their management company recently said was due out in June. Radiohead's camp subsequently qualified his claims as unofficial remarks, rather than an announcement on behalf of the band.
Here's the original:
Check out Car Seat Headrest's lyric video for his new song "Fill in the Blank:"
When the Romans weren't busy conquering their enemies, they loved to waste massive quantities of water, which gurgled and bubbled throughout their cities. The engineers of the empire invented standardized lead pipes, aqueducts as high as fortresses, and water mains with 15 bars (217 pounds per square inch) of pressure.
In the capital alone there were thousands of fountains, drinking troughs and thermal baths. Rich senators refreshed themselves in private pools and decorated their gardens with cooling grottos. The result was a record daily consumption of over 500 liters of water per capita (Germans today use around 125 liters).
However, when the Roman legions marched into the barren region of Palestine, shortly before the birth of Christ, they had to forgo the usual splashing about, at least temporarily. It was simply too dry.
Not Enough Oxygen
But that didn't stop the empire's clever engineers. They soon figured out a way to put things right. In the former Roman province of Syria (located in modern day Jordan), researchers are currently studying a sensational canal system. It extends mostly underground over a distance of 106 kilometers (66 miles).
The tunnel was discovered by Mathias Döring, a hydromechanics professor in Darmstadt, Germany. Treading on moss-covered steps, he squeezes his way into dark caverns plastered with waterproof mortar. Greek letters are emblazoned on the walls, and bats dart through the air. "Sometimes we have to stop working -- there isn't enough oxygen," says the project director.
Qanat Firaun, "Canal of the Pharaohs," is what the locals call the weathered old pipeline. There are even rumors that gold is hidden in the underground passageways that run up to 80 meters (262 feet) below the surface.
Döring has found a better explanation. It turns out the aqueduct is of Roman origin. It begins in an ancient swamp in Syria, which has long since dried out, and extends for 64 kilometers on the surface before it disappears into three tunnels, with lengths of 1, 11 and 94 kilometers. The longest previously known underground water channel of the antique world -- in Bologna -- is only 19 kilometers long.
"Amazing" is the word that the researcher uses to describe the achievement of the construction crews, who were most likely legionnaires. The soldiers chiseled over 600,000 cubic meters of stone from the ground -- or the equivalent of one-quarter of the Great Pyramid of Cheops. This colossal waterworks project supplied the great cities of the "Decapolis" -- a league originally consisting of 10 ancient communities -- with spring water. The aqueduct ended in Gadara, a city with a population of approximately 50,000. According to the Bible, this is where Jesus exorcized demons and chased them into a herd of pigs.
The Height of Its Glory
Döring will return to the site with his students in April to further explore this underworld. Every morning the group heads out into the barren landscape armed with theodolites -- instruments used for measuring angles of incline -- and GPS devices. They are looking for new entrances that lead to the hidden labyrinth. A dilapidated old farmhouse, located in the midst of the ruins of ancient Gadara, serves as an excavation camp, high above Lake Genezareth.
DER SPIEGEL How the aqueduct worked.
The massive undertaking was launched around the year 90 A.D. -- that much is clear. Emperor Domitian ruled in Rome and the empire was at the height of its glory. Frontinus, Rome's water commissioner, was in charge of nine aqueducts built on towering stone arches. He even pumped water free of charge into the cellar of the Coliseum.
The Levant was also experiencing an enormous boom thanks to trade with the Orient. The people of Rome wanted to see tigers. A tame lion prowled around Domitian's throne. Rich senators savored spices from India and wore silk from China. Whoever could afford it burned copious quantities of frankincense and purchased beautiful slaves from Arabia.
The desert trade flourished accordingly. Dust-covered caravans thronged the gates of Gadara and camels stood at the troughs. The Romans built two theaters in the city. Even a temple to the nymphs was planned, with fountains and a 22-meter-long basin.
Local springs, though, did not produce enough water to fulfill such luxurious demands. Soon the region was suffering from water shortages. So the city administration decided in favor of an unprecedented tour de force. It seems they tapped a river deep in the backcountry, near Dille in modern day Syria. The water was then routed through a trough made of Roman concrete, the famed "opus caementicium."
Bridging a Chasm
This channel was covered with slabs to protect it against animals, bird excrement and dust. This also kept out the light, which stopped the growth of algae. The pipeline inclined only slightly as it cut across the Syrian high plateau. Hundreds of cement mixers toiled under the hot sun. Finally, they reached the first city, Adraa.
But then their way was blocked by the mountainous country of northern Jordan, a chain of flat-topped peaks, surrounded by steep gorges. The very first obstacle, the Wadi al-Shalal, is a 200-meter deep gash carved into the landscape. No Roman master builder could have ever bridged this chasm. What to do now?
First, the engineers swerved to the left and ran the aqueduct along the mountainside to the south. Since the rough terrain made it virtually impossible to extend the route over the surface, however, they carved an underground channel through the rocky mountain face. This continued for 11 kilometers.
Finally, the desert valley was narrow enough that the gap could be bridged with a single bold construction. Even today the blocks of stone from this structure lie at the bottom of the ravine.
Beyond this canyon, the terrain became even more grueling with a seemingly endless succession of hills and steep slopes. Facing similar topography near Carthage, the Romans had routed water 19 kilometers across huge walls and stone arches.

The Walk starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt retells the dramatic real event of when French high-wire artist Philippe Petit walked between the two towers of the World Trade Center in 1974. Here T3 spoke to Kevin Baillie, the VFX master on the film, about how his team used some amazing technology to create some of the most stunning digital illusions ever seen on film.
T3: What was the flat out the coolest thing you did on The Walk?
Kevin Baillie: The flat out the coolest thing we did on the film was related to Joseph Gordon-Levitt's wire walking. He'd trained for eight days before the shoot with the real Philippe Petit to learn how to do wire walking and did in fact learn how to wire walk and continued doing it all the way through the production process. So there are a few shots where Joseph Gordon-Levitt is actually walking the wire. And there are a few more shots where we actually built this 20 foot long steel plank with a groove down the middle that we could bring in below the wire and raise up so it would support the wire and be there for the sides of Joseph's feet when he needed just a little bit of help. It was like training wheels for wire walking. So in all those scenes it is actually Joseph up there on the wire.
However, there were some scenes which were just way too complicated for him to do on his own. So like lying down on the wire, kneeling on the wire - the type of ballet that Petit actually did himself. So for those scenes we had a stunt performer stand in for Joseph who had trained with the Cirque du Soleil and is an amazingly talented wire performer. He was a perfect stand in however there were a lot of scenes where we saw his face, which doesn't work. So how did we fix this? We created a completely digital version of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's face! The face needed to replicate the very subtle performance that Joseph gave while on the wire himself and in total there were 37 shots in the film, some of them very long, where the digital face was used with the stunt performer. The audience though had to totally believe that it was all Joseph on the wire at all times and, as you spend all day everyday looking at people's faces, it's very easy for people to spot if something is wrong with them. It's intuitive. So far, from all the screenings people had seen, no one has yet been able to pick out which shots are the digital Joseph and which shots are not. So I think we did a great job!
T3: Speaking of which, could you talk a little about who you are and what your role was on the film's VFX team?
KB: I was the visual effects supervisor on The Walk and also own the lead visual effects company that worked on the film, Atomic Fiction. In total we had four visual effects companies working on the movie and Atomic Fiction did all of the third act of the film, so the walk between the towers and the recreation of 1974 New York. We also had Rodeo Effects in Montreal, who did a lot of the ground level material. We shot everything in Montreal and turned ground level Montreal into 1974 Manhattan as seen from the ground. Another VFX company in Prague did all of the Paris-based scenes too, so they were turning Montreal into Paris, and finally we had one more studio who were responsible for transforming the film into 3D, as it was shot in 2D. So my job was to supervise all of them as well as working closely with my company, Atomic Fiction.
T3: How large was the VFX team personnel-wise, across all studios, on The Walk?
KB: Including the crew that did the 3D conversion on the film, and with 3D conversion it's like turning every shot into a visual effect, I think there was between 500-600 people working on the film.
T3: Can you talk about Conductor? What does this technology allow you to do and why is it superior to other systems you have worked on?
KB: Conductor essentially allows artists to use cloud computing in an advantageous way. Most companies have locally built data centres, which are full of hot, power hungry computers - that's the traditional model. And in the traditional model an artist will give their own company's data centre things for it to do in the background and then move onto the next task while they wait for the computers to do their thing. It's a really expensive proposition for a visual effects studio to build and maintain these data centres because as a team's workload gets bigger and smaller, or when they are between projects, the data centre's size remains the same. Economically it's not very efficient.
Whereas what Conductor allows artists to do is the exact same thing, so offload their computer intensive processes so they can move on and just focus on being artists, however the processing is handled by cloud computing instead. Conductor doesn't use a physical data centre but a virtual one. As such, when the workload of the artists shrinks or grows, the demands from the cloud-based data centre shrinks or grows in sync. So if the team is busy you may have 1,000 computers humming away in the background doing their bidding, however when everyone is at home having dinner or they are between projects, there is a fraction of that number operating. That is a big deal as it delivers resources to artists when they need them but then they don't have to be burdened with them when there is no need. The system scales to suit the artists' needs.
T3: So, simply put, Conductor makes creating movie VFX faster and more cost effective?
KB: Sure. So on The Walk, for example, we were really challenged in terms of budget. The film only had $34 million to play with to shoot the entire thing, which is less than the visual effects budget alone of many other blockbuster movies. We had very, very tight resources. So by really developing and using Conductor, to the extent that the system can scale up to 30,000 processors at a time if needed and then right back down to 0 in a matter of minutes, we managed to save 50 per cent of the cost than if we had been working in the traditional, physical data centre model.
T3: Did Conductor help the VFX teams creatively while working on The Walk?
KB: Yes. One of the normal things that happens when you're working within a visual effects workflow and using traditional, locally situated render farms, is that when the artists submit what they have been working on they may have to wait multiple days or even a week to see the results. So say a VFX artist moved the position of a light in the computer and changed the material of the surrounding area so it is less shiny, for example. They would then hit a button to send it to the render farm for processing and, as things easily get stacked up and bottlenecked with a fixed farm, they could then have to wait a day or more to see the result of those small and quick changes. They would then come back to it when it is finally done and, in some cases, struggle to even remember what they did to affect those changes in the first place, as they have since moved onto other work areas. By using Conductor on The Walk though, as it could scale up to so many processors so fast, the artists got this sort of changes back in hours rather than days, allowing for their ideas to remain fresh in their heads and creating a more natural flow for their creativity.
That was really important on The Walk, as from the first moment that Joseph Gordon-Levitt steps out onto the wire right through to the end of his walk, it goes from early morning pre-sunrise all the way through to the afternoon and the lighting is constantly changing. For artists to be able to craft that lighting shot by shot, so it is like a character itself and point of reference for the audience, it demanded that type of fast turnaround and that is what Conductor gave us.
T3: What was the key creative challenge for the VFX team?
KB: The biggest creative challenge on The Walk, from a technical perspective, was rebuilding 1970s New York. We built out a 12-block radius from the World Trade Center and it was a massive amount of work to undertake, especially considering we were using these grainy old photographs from the 70s, to make it look genuine. We have had people come up to us though and say that they were up on the towers just after they were finished and that they looked just like they do in the film, so that was hugely gratifying for us to hear.
The towers themselves were a really creative challenge for us. Robert Zemeckis, the film's director, said to us that he wanted the towers to be a supporting character in the film. Now, we had perfect blueprints of the two towers available to us, so we could digitally build them perfectly, however the problem is that when you build things perfectly in the computer it looks fake. It looks fake because that is the architect's dream of the building, but in reality there are always deviations from the ideal. For example, different metal panels might come out of different foundries, or maybe they sat outside for different periods of time prior to been installed, or maybe different workers had varying skill levels when installing them and the result of these factors is repeated, albeit minor, differences in colour, positioning and wear to the structure. So the challenge for us was to incorporate these minor differences over the entire building as it is those imperfections that makes the structures look real. Finding that 'just right' amount of imperfection to add to the buildings was absolutely key.
The Walk is out next Monday, 1st February, on Blu-ray, 3D Blu-ray and DVD. For a closer look at the awesome VFX on display in the film then check out the trailer below.
With the unrest occurring on Manus Island at the moment, it is hard to fathom what life is actually like on one of our offshore detention centres. Former Murtoa resident and Salvation Army employee Jack Rabl spent eight months working as a case manager at the Nauru off-shore detention centre between November 2012 to July 2013.
Surreal existence
He says existence on the island is surreal; a place you could not imagine exists.
"We're talking about one of the most isolated places on the planet, the smallest country in the world with no other land for hundreds and hundreds of kilometres."
"An island where every piece of water, fruit and vegetable had to be shipped in from Australia and in the very centre of it is a moonscape of rocks from an old mine and fences and hundreds of people in tents inside there."
Jack says the centre is extremely overcrowded with a mixture of families, unaccompanied minors and pregnant women.
"We would have open-walled army tents, which were deteriorating, leaking roofs with tarps put over the top of them that could house 30 people."
"We're talking stretch of beds or just boards for beds, shoulder to shoulder, foot to foot, so no room to roll over in your own space."
"And then communal spaces that are heavily patrolled by security presence but the tents themselves were under security presence as well."
Hopelessness and despair
He says the environement is filled with hopelessness and despair due to the constant uncertainty and misinformation regarding the future of detainees.
"People were told originally that it could be six months until they know their outcome, then they were told, when I was there, when Scott Morrison was opposition and he came over and said, this was in December in 2012, 'If we come to power, you will never leave here', that hit people pretty hard."
"When he did come to power, he has made it clear that he's quite happy for people to be there forever."
Jack says people have lost the ability to envision a future outside the detention centre.
He says the state of their mental health is frightening.
"It's destroying people, people who are arriving with so much strength and vibrancy having just escaped the most awful places on the planet were coming in so full of energy... even learning the language of other asylum seekers, you know Pakistani men learning Tamil a Sri Lankan language."
"I saw that just being drained away, day in day out."
Global refugee crisis
Jack says the government needs to review their asylum seeker policy as it is an international crisis.
"They get on boats knowing that they could die in the ocean, but they found the ability for that boat journey because they knew they would die in their homes if they didn't leave."
"That's what I heard again and again and saw the evidence of that and saw the photographs people had carried in their wallets with them of their brother, his mutilated body that was left at their doorstop."
"The problem isn't just our problem, this is all around the world."
ABC's Steve Martin spoke to Jack Rabl

Facebook is wishing some of its "Jewish" users a Happy New Year.
Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, began Wednesday evening -- and some Facebook users received a celebratory message when they logged in.
"Happy New Year! All of us at Facebook wish you a sweet and happy new year."
While the note was well received by some, others questioned how exactly the social network was aware of their religious affiliation. In some cases, Facebook users who aren't Jewish were also served the message.
"Dear Facebook, I appreciate the well wishes. But I'm not Jewish," tweeted one user.
Mauricio Sadicoff, a Jewish software engineer living in Illinois, also received the message, despite the fact that his profile doesn't list a religion.
"I have posted about Chanukah in past years, so maybe that?" he asked.
This is creepy in many levels... I don't have any religion listed on my profile and Facebook just wished me a happy Jewish new year. — Mau Sadicoff (@tatonka) September 21, 2017
So what gives?
Not surprisingly, the social media giant collects troves of data on its users. If you've ever clicked on ads -- for a retailer or a fashion designer -- or posted updates about political topics, the shows you're watching or holidays, the company pulls that data into your ad preferences page. (Want to see what Facebook thinks it knows about you? Take a peek here).
That information is categorized to "help advertisers reach people who are most likely to be interested in their products, services, and causes," Facebook states on the ad page.
In addition to using the information people have provided on Facebook, the company also says it tracks "other activity."
The categories listed on user accounts can get very specific, such as "close friends of expats," "away from family," and "returned from travels 1 week ago," as well as more generic ones like "millennial." (The company also appears to be testing a tool that lets users hide ads for alcohol and parenting, either temporarily or permanently.)

"We send messages about religious moments to people in countries where a large proportion of the population observes the religion, or where the religious date is a public holiday," a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement. "We may also show the message to people who've expressed interest in the holiday. We celebrate the most widely-observed moments across the major religions represented in our global community."
Siva Vaidhyanathan, a media studies professor at the University of Virginia, said the Rosh Hashanah messaging is another example of the extent to which Facebook is tracking us.
Related: Sheryl Sandberg 'disgusted' by anti-Semitic ad targeting
The timing of the message is particularly notable. Last week, a ProPublica report revealed that Facebook let advertisers target users using terms like "jew hater."
Hours before Facebook pushed out the Rosh Hashanah message, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said she was "disgusted and disappointed" that Facebook was helping advertisers target anti-Semitic users.
"Many of my friends expressed the understandable concern about Facebook compiling a list of Jews," Vaidhyanathan told CNN Tech. "It seems like a really odd moment to be doing that and declaring one's ability to do that. This seems so politically tone deaf at this moment."
Related: Facebook handed Russia-linked ads over to Mueller
Bernard E. Harcourt, professor at Columbia University and author of Exposed: Desire and Disobedience in the Digital Age, called it an "aggressively intrusive move."
It's unclear whether this is the first time Facebook has sent a Rosh Hashanah message to Jewish users. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Facebook may be well-meaning, but it's important to consider the other reasons that Facebook is targeting users with Rosh Hashanah messaging.
"I'm not saying it is, but it would be a kind of brilliant and perfect way to test your algorithms," Harcourt said.
In other words, as Facebook users respond with comments like "I'm not Jewish but thanks anyways," or "How did Facebook know I'm Jewish?" -- the social network can further validate what it knows.
"If you do want to target Jews for advertising, now you've got a much sharper and better algorithm as a result of the corrections that were made," Harcourt said.
New Delhi: Delhi Police on Friday issued an alert after the driver of a taxi hired by three unidentified persons from Pathankot was found dead in Kangra district in Himachal Pradesh, in the aftermath of the airbase attack.
The taxi driver, identified as Vijay Kumar, a resident of Gaggal village in Kangra district, was found dead on Wednesday at the Kalta bridge in Kangra and his taxi missing, police said.
The Delhi Police tweeted out alerts from their official Twitter handle saying:
ALERT Pathankot Alto Carjacked... Here are the images of the suspects. #SayNoToTerror #SafeTogether pic.twitter.com/VfBC1b5qDY — Delhi Police (@DelhiPolice) January 22, 2016
According to a DNA report, the Delhi Police had been on alert since the blue beacon flashing SUV of a senior IPS officer was stolen.
Asked on the threat perception, Delhi police Commissioner BS Bassi urged people in the city to remain alert without
disclosing any further details citing security concerns.
Meanwhile, speaking to The Hindustan Times, Deputy Commissioner of Police Rajan Bhagat said, "There is no need to panic but we urge people to stay alert. Citizens should inform the police control room if they see any suspicious activity around them."
The alert was issued in the backdrop of the attack on IAF base in Pathankot where terrorists had first killed a cab driver and robbed his car before launching the strike.
Delhi Police has approached media houses in helping it find the car and spread the alert message through retweets.
This alert comes right ahead of the Republic Day parade in the National Capital, for which security was already heightened.
On Monday, Home Minister Rajnath Singh reviewed the security situation in Delhi with Delhi Police Commissioner Bassi and other senior officials from intelligence and security agencies.
As per Home Ministry sources, the security machinery is fully alert to foil any threat by terror groups and possible presence of Islamic State sympathisers is also being factored.
“There may make an attempt to undermine the sense of security through small actions such as knife attack on security personnel or snatching of service weapons. But the security agencies are alert and will foil any such attempt,” a ministry source said.
The Pathankot terror attack has been weighing heavy on the minds of India's security machinery and all security aspects are being looked into.

Here's how the story goes: It was World War I, and Charlie Perkins and his four friends were sent to the Front. Only Charlie – a flight instructor with the Royal Flying Corps – came home.
But he wasn't going to let the memory of his friends die. On returning to Canada, Charlie created a memorial from the tree – a glorious old Douglas fir – that stood near the swimming hole the five use to play in as children. He planted ivy around the trees base; laid wreaths; hung flags. And with time, his heartfelt memorial became something of a local institution. But trouble lay ahead…
In 1960, the Surrey leg of Highway 1 began construction and its proposed route ran right through the glade in which the tree stood. By now, Charlie was a senior but that didn't stop him protesting. It wasn't long before he was joined by friends, neighbours – true Surrey citizens. Folks who valued this living epitaph enough to make a stand. And amazingly, they won! Highway 1 weaves around Charlie's tree to this day.
The bend in the road is visible to the right of the eastbound lanes of the Trans-Canada Highway between the 176th Street and 200th Street exits. Sadly, Charlie's tree doesn't look much like a tree this day. Vandals set fire to it years back, necessitating the need for it to be topped. Despite this, the Whalley Legion places a wreath at the base of this old Douglas fir every year. Today's true Surrey residents leave flowers, flags, trinkets… objects of remembrance, tributes to Charlie Perkins and the four childhood friends that he wouldn't let be forgotten.

Time for a revolt you say?
There will never be a revolution as long as people are given enough cash in the form of welfare to allow them to buy beer, drugs and pay for their cigarettes and cell phones.
That's what Marie Antoinette failed to realize and she lost her head over it.
Also having a para military force such as the police ready to follow orders given by a corrupt government serves as a powerful deterrent (keep in mind the settlements made with police unions during wage negotiations).
All in all, Canada as a country is doomed if we continue to accept the legislation that is proposed by the NDP and Liberals.
There is a reason why so much of our consumer products are from China.
The sitting governments are working towards the elimination of all industries in this country.
Once the industries leave, there will be more people on the welfare system and the taxpayer will be on the hook to cover the costs of these welfare programmes.
When you lose industries, you lose entities that pay a lot of taxes and thus lighten the burden on the common taxpaying public.

The two representatives of the region's vassal made a pilgrimage to the American capital to give President Barack Obama the two ends of the rope we're supposed to hang ourselves with - not all of us, not right away, not only us. First President Shimon Peres arrived as the representative of the "peace camp," and was followed immediately by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The "peace camp" has melted like ice after relying for years on strange mantras such as "the Americans are opposed to the settlements," "the administration will initiate a peace plan," and of course, "the Israeli right is irritating our greatest friend in the West." That was a baseless platform that eventually led to the peace camp's demise. You can't spend night and day making vain prophesies and recruiting supporters to the struggle. Peace Now, Meretz and the Labor Party relied on the best-quality hashish of "the Americans will not allow it." But the Americans gave, and how they gave! Dollars and burial stones.
Wars broke out, despite the strongest convictions of their opponents, as if the Americans were opposed, while the Israel Defense Forces, which is not an American army, heaven forbid, tried to be clever and outsmart the Americans. People believed that in the end, after the mass killings (in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip ), there would be a happy end and "the Americans would force a peace agreement on the sides" - because the Americans are a policeman on behalf of Western justice.
Now that the "peace camp" has waned and the people need the simple faith that we're the ones who decide on the agenda, Netanyahu's prestige is rising. According to the new folklore, the prime minister "dictated the Americans' agenda," as if Israel's strength weren't built by the Americans precisely for this necessity - the carrot and the stick of control in the Middle East. The stick is a direct Israeli threat, like the one against Iran. The carrot is "an Israeli withdrawal," "a comprehensive settlement" or "the United States will restrain Israel." The neighborhood thug will not attack because the U.S. will not allow him to.
This is a structure in which different forces act. The United States is a coalition of interests, sometimes even opposing interests, of those who support and those who oppose terrible wars - in the administration, in the economy and in politics. But the U.S. continues to act as it always has acted. Hans Morgenthau's doctrine dictates that they rely on the existing balance of power in regional conflicts.
There's no doubt that the United States has never been interested in the sources of the conflict with the Palestinians, but rather tries to benefit by nurturing it, fanning its flames, paying for it and "conducting negotiations" via the strong side to gain control in the region. There's no better example than the scuttling of the agreed-on solution by the two superpowers after the Yom Kippur War, in favor of a partial agreement that ensured control over the Palestinians and the extension of the settlements.
Within this structure, Israel's permanent role is to fix "an agenda," and the Americans' role is to say that "Israel has the right to defend itself" - and also to say the exact opposite.

Of course, within this structure there's great value in the "moderate camp" because the United States chooses the "moderate camp" from the strong side. That's why the visit by Peres - the statue of the "peace camp" - took place a day before Netanyahu's.
This is the rope Israel is gradually hanging itself with. Those celebrating the victory of Iran Now over Palestine Now know well that this Now - via the destructive power that the U.S. finances and which nurtures the settlements and the army - is designed to turn us into a country where it may be interesting to live but where it's also very bad to live.
Democrats across the nation continue to worry about the Virginia governor's race as the polls remain tight between Republican Ed Gillespie and Democrat Ralph Northam.
Democrats continue to lag behind Republicans in fundraising ahead of the 2018 midterm election. Democrats continue to worry about what a potential loss for Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam against Republican Ed Gillespie on November 7 could mean for the midterm election.
Susan Swecker, the chairwoman of the Democratic party of Virginia, explained, “We're Ground Zero. All eyes are on us. I can understand that because last year broke my heart.”
Democrats amped up the Virginia governor's race by bringing in former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden. Obama, at his first public campaign rally since leaving office, said that “democracy is at stake” in the Virginia gubernatorial race.
Other democratic operatives believe that Democrats have a branding problem, one that makes it more difficult to rally middle-class and rural voters who flocked to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.
Ken Martin, the chairman of Minnesota's Democratic Farmer-Labor Party, charged, “From a branding perspective, we have a huge problem. It was the biggest challenge for us in the last year — and our biggest mistake was uniting around ‘Stop Trump.'”
Defeat could prompt increased tension between the Democratic Party's establishment and the progressive activists. Northam, who was backed by most of Virginia's Democratic establishment, beat the Sen. Bernie Sanders-endorsed (I-VT) Rep. Tom Perriello, a race that many believed to mirror the 2016 Democratic presidential election's primaries.
Martin then suggested that Democrats' overconfidence in the 2016 presidential election led to a stunning defeat.
Martin said, “That sense of complacency led people to take their foot off the gas. We saw a dip in volunteers in the last few weeks, turnout dropped. That cannot ever happen again.”
The Democratic National Committee (DNC) began dumping resources into Virginia since July, where it spent $1.5 million and hired almost 40 staff members, although that pales in comparison to the Republican National Committee (RNC).
The DNC raised $4.4 million in August, although it has a debt of $4.1 million, which remains almost twice the size of its cash reserves. The RNC has $45.9 million in its coffers and no outstanding debt. The RNC spent $3 million in Virginia and hired 80 staff members in Virginia.
RNC spokesman Michael Ahrens said, “The RNC never left Virginia and has had field staff on the ground since 2013.”
Republican candidate Ed Gillespie recently took the lead in the polls against his Democratic competition, Ralph Northam.
Gillespie's rise in the polls coincides with his outreach to the Republican base. Gillespie barely eked out a victory over his populist primary opponent, Corey Stewart. Stewart is now running for Senate against incumbent Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA).
Gillespie made sanctuary cities, one of Trump's staple issues, one of his own. In the third and final debate between Gillespie and Northam, Gillespie attacked his Democrat opponent when Northam refused to say whether he would sign a bill that bans sanctuary cities in Virginia.
Gillespie also said he will push for issues that will help rural voters to better rally Trump's base amidst concerns that Republicans do not have the same enthusiasm towards Gillespie as they did towards Trump.
Local Virginian Kim McFall said that she had not been impressed by Gillespie, although she will probably vote for Gillespie. McFall said, “He's wishy-washy.”
Gillespie stated that he seeks to improve rural Virginia's economy with tax cuts and fewer regulations. Gillespie said, “We need industrial hemp, we need to have more outdoor recreation jobs, we need to complete the Clinch River State Park. All the detailed specifics I've put forward tonight I think are going to rally people here and they're going to turn out to vote for me.”
Cliff Cauthorne, a local Virginia town council member, said that Gillespie only has one good option to rally his rural town's voters: a Trump rally “or two.”
Vancouver Coastal Health wants to see local beaches exempt from a proposal by Transport Canada that suggests small pleasure boats be allowed to dump their sewage closer to shore.
Medical health officer Dr. Mark Lysyshyn said such a move, which is still in the public consultation phase, could potentially increase the occurrence of E. coli in local waters and lead to more frequent closures of the area's beaches. Under Transport Canada's plan, small boats carrying fewer than 15 people would be allowed to discharge sewage just one nautical mile from shore, closer than the three nautical miles that are required today.
One nautical mile is roughly the distance between Sunset and Kitsilano beaches, Lysyshyn said.
Last summer was one of the worst for E. coli at local beaches, Lysyshyn said, with West Vancouver beaches closed for much of August and favourites like Sunset Beach posting “beach closed” signs.
“This concerned us because we don't know to what degree the water quality at the beaches is affected by small boats but that's part of the equation,” Lysyshyn said. “We just felt like this wasn't the right direction to go. The West Vancouver beaches were closed for almost four weeks, almost all of August, exactly when people would want to swim.
“We typically have (high) counts in False Creek but this was a new problem.”
Lysyshyn, in conjunction with Metro Vancouver municipalities, has sent a letter to Transport Canada outlining Vancouver Coastal Health's concerns with the proposal, which is among a series of amendments to Transport Canada's Vessel Pollution and Dangerous Chemical Regulations.
Lysyshyn notes it's very difficult to police small vessels and is asking Transport Canada to maintain the status quo.
“We'd like to work with them to have the beaches around our district, in Burrard Inlet, as a no-discharge area,” Lysyshyn said, adding beaches are seen as great areas for recreation and physical activities. He noted municipalities, which are responsible for maintaining local beaches as well as sewage collection, have an economic incentive to keep the areas clean.
High levels of bacteria are usually blamed on fecal contamination from human or animal sources.
Metro Vancouver, which monitors water quality at beaches all year, issued swimming advisories last July for the Ambleside, Dundarave and Sandy Cove beaches along West Vancouver's English Bay waterfront after E. coli levels were found to be above the maximum allowable guideline of 200 bacteria per 100 millilitres of water. Sunset Beach was also found to be at 231 counts. This means the seawater could pose health or infection risks, especially if swimmers swallow it.
“When the levels get too high you start to see an association with gastrointestinal illnesses.” Lysyshyn said.
The waters of east False Creek, near Vancouver's downtown core, off Science World, also had a bacteria count of 500. No advisories were issued there because it is not considered a swimming beach, but there were warnings to paddlers to stay out of the water.
Transport Canada declined to comment Friday because the process is still in the consultation phase.

Former Butler University basketball player Andrew Smith died Tuesday after a long, public battle with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and later leukemia. He was 25.
The Smith family made its struggles public not only to keep family, friends and fans informed, but to use it as a platform for their Christian faith and to increase support for causes such as bone marrow registry.
Butler players will wear a patch on their uniforms for rest of the season in Smith's honor, featuring his initials and jersey No. 44.
Smith's wife, Samantha, posted on Twitter: "Andrew peacefully passed away in his sleep and in my arms as I told him I loved him this morning. Love you always, Smith."
Samantha introduced a blog chronicling Andrew's medical battle, kickingcancerwiththesmiths.wordpress.com. Other than family, Samantha said, Brad Stevens called or texted Andrew more than anyone. The former Butler coach visited Andrew Smith when he traveled to Indianapolis with his Boston Celtics for a Nov. 4 game against the Indiana Pacers, and left the Celtics on Thursday to travel to Indianapolis and visit Smith.
"He was special — caring, fun, smart and the toughest person I knew. Never once complained through all of his medical issues," Stevens said in a text message to IndyStar. "I'm so proud to have known him."
Stevens' voice broke during his pregame talk Tuesday night before the Celtics' game in New York against the Knicks.
"You know, I was happy that I got a chance to say goodbye," he told Boston media. "And this is really about when you coach somebody, I mean, you get a lot more out of coaching them than they do from you, so ... that's that. I mean, I don't know. I could go on and on, and it wouldn't do him justice."
In a statement from the Smith family, Andrew's father, Curt, said: "Andrew packed more living into his 25 years than most of us will enjoy in a full 75 years. He lived his faith, relished his family, selflessly served his wife, and pursued his passion of basketball at the highest levels."
One of Smith's former teammates, Rotnei Clarke, posted on Twitter:
"Andrew Smith was a perfect Christ-like example and an inspiration to me. He was one of the toughest guys I have ever been around. I have lost an awesome teammate, a great friend and a brother!! I know he made a difference in the lives of so many! I know for a fact he is in a better place. It was an honor to have known you and I love ya Moose."
Senior guard Kellen Dunham, who roomed with Smith on the road during his freshman season, said his former teammate would leave a legacy.
"More importantly than his wins, just his attitude and the way he lived the Butler Way, and the way he was so passionate about his faith," Dunham said, will influence players who go through the Butler program.
Second-year Butler coach Chris Holtmann did not coach Smith but came to know him later. The coach teared up when he recounted Smith's texted reply when Holtmann asked before the season if he could do anything for him.
"He said, 'Just have a great year. Just have a great year,' " Holtmann said. "We're going to do our best to do that.”
Tributes to Smith poured in from around the country, coming not only from those in the Butler family but from college basketball media, schools and conference offices.
The 6-11 Smith was a star at Covenant Christian but was not heavily recruited out of high school. He eventually accepted a scholarship offer to Butler before his senior season. He led Indiana high school players in rebounding in 2009 and was All-City Player of the Year.
Smith, Matt Howard and Joel Cornette are the only three players in Butler history with more than 100 victories and 1,000 points in a career. Smith also was an academic All-American.
Smith played little as a college freshman but came off the bench in the 2010 West Regional final against Kansas State after Howard encountered foul trouble. Smith had played a total of three minutes over the previous month but logged a season-high 12 minutes in a 63-56 victory that propelled the Bulldogs into their first Final Four.
As a sophomore, Smith was inserted as starting center, allowing Howard to move to power forward. That lineup change by Stevens was a turning point in what became the Bulldogs' second run to the Final Four.
Butler's president James Danko said the back-to-back Final Fours gave the university a national profile.
"The move to the Big East would never have happened without that," Danko said. "Andrew was part of that team that made that happen. So his impact on the university is profound."
The Bulldogs missed the 2012 NCAA tournament. The following season, Butler beat two No. 1 seeds (Indiana and Gonzaga) and returned to the field. In a 68-56 victory against Bucknell, Smith scored 14 points and set a Butler record for an NCAA tournament game with 16 rebounds.
He and the former Samantha Stage were married in May 2013.
In an September interview, he said he thought he would be playing pro basketball until he was 30. He said he often thought it would be “weird” to know he was playing his last game. Instead, the ending was abrupt and unforeseen.
In 2013, he signed with a pro team in Lithuania. While there, an examination revealed a mass in his chest. Upon returning to Indianapolis, he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in January 2014. He lost 40 pounds because of chemotherapy but made some progress. He began work at Mina Leasing and Financial Services in July 2014.
Just four days into his new job, he went into cardiac arrest for more than 22 minutes before being revived and transported to the hospital. He was placed into a medically induced coma. He awoke four days later and did not show signs of any neurological damage.
He stayed connected to basketball last spring and summer by coaching fourth-graders for Indiana Faith, a program for basketball and spiritual training.
Smith underwent a bone marrow transplant Nov. 6. But days later, he was readmitted to the hospital after the transplant failed and his condition worsened. His wife's blog stated the lymphoma had transformed into leukemia.
“We are worried. We are scared. We are devastated,” Samantha wrote.
She wrote that the only treatment option left was a clinical study. She added that while their doctors were fighting to make that happen, they would “need a miracle” to save her husband's life.
Smith was largely confined in recent weeks but was able to attend the Dec. 19 game, in which Butler defeated previously unbeaten Purdue 74-68 in the Crossroad Classic at Bankers Life Fieldhouse.
"And it meant so much to our players," Holtmann said. "Those that played with him, and those that have come to know him through this experience. It really showed his love for this place, how connected he was to his basketball family and to his university family."
Smith was released from the hospital in time to be home for Christmas. He was readmitted Jan. 6.
He was born Sept. 9, 1990, in Washington, D.C., and spent most of his life in Zionsville.
Arrangements are pending. Memorial and funeral services will be at Traders Point Christian Church, Whitestown, where Smith was a longtime member and was baptized by his father.
He is survived by his wife, Samantha; mother, Debbie Sutter Smith; father, Curt Smith; brother, Stephen Smith, and sister-in-law, Jennifer Foley Smith; older sister, Julie Webster, brother-in-law, John Webster, all of the Indianapolis area. He also is survived by a younger sister, Kimberly Smith, of Los Angeles, who is a professional beach volleyball player. Andrew also is survived by a niece, Harper Foley Smith, a nephew, Knox Curtis Smith, and maternal grandparents, James and Nedra Sutter of Marion, Ind., as well as aunts, uncles and cousins.

Joint Statement from Butler President James Danko and Butler Vice President/Director of Athletics Barry Collier on the Passing of Andrew Smith

It's about time I got my hands on a copy of Seasons. It's been high up on the list for more than a year now. I first played it at GenCon in 2012, and thought it was easily one of the best games at that show (though in all fairness, I didn't exactly try them all, since I was working the whole time). But the game sold out almost immediately, and I didn't manage to get a review copy until last month. So finally, after having played the game dozens of times at conventions or with copies owned by other people, I can tell you why you should go get a copy for yourself.
I met Regis Bonnessee, the designer of Seasons, at that GenCon where I first played his game. After playing the game once, I had the opportunity to ask him if he did a large variety of drugs. He is French, and so he did not entirely understand my question, which makes sense because really, who asks people if they do drugs? But if you see Seasons, and someone explains the rules of the game, you'll be able to understand why I thought mind-altering substances must have been involved in the game's development.
You've got this circle in the middle of the table that tells you what season you're in, and that determines how many crystals you can get if you transmute energy, and also tells you what color of gigantic dice you roll. You roll one more die than you have players – four players, roll five dice – and then pick dice with pictures of fire and water drops and shrubbery. And you use these dice to power the cards in your hand, which do a variety of cool things but are also worth a bunch of points at the end of the game.
So the basic description of Seasons is weird enough, but you should see the components. They look like they were designed by Salvador Dalí on an absinthe bender. Honking big dice, cardboard circles with pictures of elements, this wild round thing in the middle of the table like a twisted Ouija board, and a big stack of cards with some seriously trippy art. There's a rabbit with bugged-out eyes who look like he's tripping balls. There's an hourglass in the middle of a sand castle built on top of a sundial. And there's a potion of dreams, but I have no idea what that picture is supposed to be.
Basically, you've got a game with all these weird moving parts, and lots of cards with oddly beautiful art, and it just does not look like all these things should go together unless you are hallucinating. But once the rules are explained and you finish your second or third turn, everything will start to click and you'll see that Seasons only looks odd because you've never played anything like this before. It's weird because it's unfamiliar, but it's brilliant because of how well it all works.
The basic goal is to earn the most points, which you get by playing cards. Most of the cards are worth something at the end of the game (unless you have not played them, and then they count against you). Many of the cards give you a way to score points during the game, and exploiting these cards is critical. The dice you choose will give you energy tokens, which you can turn into points, but you may also need them to play more cards. Some of the cards give you energy tokens, which you can use to play more cards, which you can play to get a better exchange rate for your tokens.
What happens, then, is a seamless and captivating synergy, where you're playing just the right card at just the right time to get just the right effect. At the beginning, when you're short on resources and can't play anything at all, this can be hard to see. But when the end of the game comes, and your one quick action turns into a series of triggers and counter-actions that balance against each other to produce an amazing chain of effects, you'll wonder where Seasons have been all your life.
You know that sort of zen-state you get when you're playing Magic and everything is coming together, when you've got just the right combinations at just the right time and the game feels like a well-oiled machine? Seasons is a little like that, but where that only happens in Magic if you're lucky, it happens in Seasons every time you're good enough to make it work. You have so much control over your own plays, and there are so many cards that can counter your opponents (and then cards that can counter those counters) that the skilled player is going to get that rush of seeing everything working, and he or she is going to get it every game.
Regis assured me that no illegal pharmaceuticals were involved in the creation process of Seasons, and once I got a few plays under my belt, it became obvious that no stoner could have invented something that works this well. Seasons is an exceptional game, one that you'll want to master, and then buy all the expansions, and play with a bunch of people to try out different strategies and different cards. It provides that mental challenge that I crave in a game, where every decision is tricky and you're constantly shifting your strategy to accommodate changing conditions. It is brilliant without being deliberate and easy enough to learn that you can teach new people in minutes (though if you're any good, it will take them hours of practice before they can beat you). It's original and exciting, plays great with any number of players, and will keep you coming back for more.
Summary
2-4 players
Pros:
Original and brilliant
Cunning strategy that has to shift on the fly
Every decision counts, but rarely will one decision completely destroy you
Looks amazing
Cons:You cannot lick the dice to get high
Coolstuff has a good price on Seasons. You should buy it.
BUY SEASONS, NOT LSD
Author pays tribute to writer imprisoned for championing free expression, and to the PEN campaign to free him
Salman Rushdie has welcomed the release of the Syrian activist Mazen Darwish from prison after almost three-and-a-half years.
Darwish, founder of the Damascus-based Syrian Centre for Media and Free Expression, had been detained in February 2012 following a raid by Syrian Air Force Intelligence of his offices, according to English PEN. Along with colleagues Hani Al-Zitani and Hussein Gharir, he was imprisoned on charges of “publicising terrorist acts” and reportedly subjected to torture, said PEN.
His case was highlighted by Rushdie last October, when the Booker-winning novelist shared his PEN Pinter prize with the lawyer, journalist and activist. At the time, Rushdie called Darwish's detention “arbitrary and unjust”, praising how the writer “courageously fought for civilised values – free expression, human rights – in one of the most dangerous places in the world”. PEN believes that Darwish, Al-Zitani and Gharir were being held “solely for the peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of expression”.
Message from PEN Pinter prizewinner: My plea for Syria | Mazen Darwish Read more
On Monday, Rushdie said he was delighted by the good news about Darwish's release. “Congratulations to Mazen Darwish and his family, and to English PEN for so energetically, and successfully, highlighting and pursuing his case,” the novelist said.
Darwish's release was confirmed by Yara Bader, his wife and director of the Syrian pressure group. “The Syrian Centre for Media and Freedom of Expression welcomes [our] colleague Darwish, and congratulates him [on] his freedom,” Bader said in a statement on Monday. “After the arbitrary arrest that lasted three years, five months, and 23 days, Mazen Darwish was released today.”
But while Darwish has been released, the charges against him are understood to remain, and according to Bader he is scheduled to attend a court hearing on 31 August, about which English PEN said it remained “seriously concerned”.
“We are so relieved that Mazen Darwish has finally been released, and happy for Mazen and his wife Yara Bader,” said director Jo Glanville. “Yara has been a great inspiration to us all throughout the campaign for his release, and we hope that they will be reunited very soon. However, we also remain concerned for Mazen and his colleagues Hani al-Zitani and Hussein Gharir and will continue to call for charges against them to be dropped immediately and unconditionally.”
Al-Zitani and Gharir were released in July following a presidential pardon, but still face criminal charges. PEN says that Syria is one of the world's most dangerous countries for journalists; it is ranked 177th out of 180 in the 2015 World Press Freedom Index, which says that in 2014, 15 journalists and 17 net-citizens were killed there.
Good news, Star Wars fans: Director J.J. Abrams is just as upset about the lack of Rey toys as fans are.
In recent weeks, Star Wars fans have been vocal about the apparent underrepresentation of Force Awakens lead character Rey (Daisy Ridley), and by extension other female characters, in the film's tie-in toys and merchandise. Many tweeted complaints featuring the hashtags #WheresRey and #WhereIsRey. In fact, after fan outcry over Rey's exclusion from the Force Awakens-themed Monopoly, Hasbro announced it would add her to an updated version of the game. (“We love the passion fans have for Rey, and are happy to announce that we will be making a running change to include her in the Monopoly: Star Wars game available later this year,” a Hasbro spokesperson said in a statement to EW.)
While some believed the lack of Rey merchandise was due to Abrams' known aversion to spoilers — like, say, if a toy depicted Rey holding the famed lightsaber — the prolific director debunked that theory during the Television Critics Association's press tour on Saturday, where Abrams was promoting his Hulu project, 11.22.63.
“I wish I had more details about merchandising and the schedule,” he said. “I'm learning things as you are. I will say that it seems preposterous and wrong that the main character of the movie is not well represented in what is clearly a huge piece of the Star Wars world in terms of merchandizing. […] I read that she wasn't in the Monopoly game and was quickly making phone calls about this because if it were true — and it is true, and now Hasbro, of course, has said they're going to put Rey in — it doesn't quite make sense why she wouldn't be there. She's somewhat important in the story.”
An understatement to say the least. Rey has become a beacon for the largest Star Wars installment, now a role model for the new and old generation of Star Wars fans alike.
RELATED: Daisy Ridley hopes fans will connect with Rey
“I think Rey is a great character, and for people to see and perhaps relate to her, and see something in her that they feel and connect with the story — that, I just think, is amazing,” Ridley told EW about her character earlier this year.
Read much more about Rey's impact here. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is out now, and stands as the highest grossing film of all time in North America, with more than $770 million in ticket sales.
Abrams also reveled whether The Force Awakens will have deleted scenes or an extended cut, debuted the first trailer for his time-travel miniseries 11.22.63 and revealed his CBS drama Person of Interest was likely canceled after this season.
RAIPUR/NEW DELHI: Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh on Saturday confirmed that Maoists have taken over 200 villagers hostage in the state's Sukma district. According to the CM, 5 to 6 people are negotiating with the insurgents for the release of the hostages.The Naxalite action comes ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to insurgency-hit Bastar region.Earlier, Sukma additional police superintendent had said a large number of armed Maoists stormed into Marenga and adjoining villages under restive Tongpal police station limits late last night and took away 400-500 villagers, including women and children, along with them.The Maoists have been opposing construction of a bridge on a river near Marenga village that they believe would facilitate increased mobility of security forces during operations against them.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Modi, who was on a visit to the neighbouring Dantewada district, said there was no future for violence in democracy."Only plough on shoulders can bring development, not guns," he said addressing a rally at Dantewada."The macabre drama of death will end," he said, referring to Naxalite violence in the state.
Last week, Common looked directly into The Tonight Show camera and rapped, "Trayvon'll never get to be an older man / Black children, they childhood stole from them / Robbed of our names and our language, stole again / Who stole the soul from black folk?"
His face and his words were broadcast into more than three million homes that night. Hood up, backed by string instruments and The Roots, his breathless performance of "Black America Again" had an urgency rarely seen on late night television, on news programs, or elsewhere. And since this is The Tonight Show we're talking about, some of these three million people certainly aren't Common's typical audience—they're not used to hearing his viewpoint or his music. This is an audience tuning in to see Jimmy Fallon play silly games, who would otherwise read and watch programs to which they're more ideologically aligned (if they do at all).
Common has a new album, Black America Again, coming out today, so in theory, he's doing late night performances like these to sell a few records. The best way to sell records is to play it safe—to keep your mouth shut, write a verse, chorus, and hook about a breakup and let everyone feel comfortable and unchallenged while spending $$ on your politically neutral personal brand.
Not Common. In the first verse of the first song on his first album, Common made it pretty clear what he was going to do:
"Now what do niggas do when they got not food / Skibbidy skap and busta bust a rap / So I pick up the pen and then begin the thoughts to get to pumpin / Hopin like all the people let me talk, let me say somethin / Cause nothin for nothin leaves nothin, I got nuthin to lose"
That was in 1992. In the 24 years since, he's won three Grammys, a Golden Globe, and an Academy Award. He's released 11 albums, acted in dozens of films, and become a political activist for causes both globally and in his home of Chicago. Any artist worried about sacrificing sales or success for speaking their mind should talk to Common, someone who has built a career upon the idea that anyone with a platform has a responsibility to discuss the issues affecting this country.
"We often go through the battle that people won't accept us or it won't be popular," Common told me this week. "But when it's in your heart, you have to follow your heart and do it. And the fact that you're an artist that has millions of ears that potentially can reach hundreds of millions of ears and spirits and hearts... Man, why not use that gift to uplift others and to speak up for others who don't get to speak up?"
As activists have been saying for generations, our voice is the most powerful tool. And on Common's new album, his voice has lost none of its potency over the years. In fact, given the volatile state of American society and politics, we need that voice now more than ever. That's actually why we're getting a new Common album this year rather than an EP (which is what he had originally planned).
On the day the Cubs won their first World Series in more than 100 years, I spoke with Common (although the Chicago native is a White Sox fan, he was rooting for the Cubs) about the new album, the future of hip-hop and how the genre has become our most powerful force of social change.
ESQ: I loved your performance with The Roots on The Tonight Show last week. It's cool to see you performing that song in front of an audience that might not be familiar with hip-hop or your message. What can these people take away from this?
Getty
Common: Well, you know, the one thing that I've been experiencing with this song specifically is that you don't have to be into hip-hop to understand it, to feel it, to comprehend it. A friend of mine describes Black America Again as a monologue, and I think that I look at it sometimes like it's a speech. It's something that I'm giving. And I think the words are direct enough and clear enough. I do it in a church or I've done it in a classroom, where there were kids who were 10 years old listening and reacting to certain lines and I was like, this is amazing. I think, no matter the setting, the purity that's in the song and that's in the heart and how clear it is resonates.
And so do you think a song like that could change somebody's mind or make them think differently?
Truly, I truly believe that. I mean, the intention and the purpose is to really inspire and activate people to want to be a part of the change and to empower black people. Not only black people, but saying that everybody has to be a part of Black America rising to equality. It's not just going to be us doing it. It has to be everybody. And as we rise, everybody rises; this country is so many different nationalities and cultures, and if one is being pushed down, there's no way for the other to live in harmony in life because it's uneven. It's not balanced. I think that this song and this album and this movement and the art that we're putting out and the conversations that we're having can change lives, and that's the only reason why I'm doing it. I mean, the major reason why I'm doing it. I love being an artist, obviously, but the purpose of it and the intention of it is to shift the paradigm and improve lives.
The purpose and intention of being an artist is to shift the paradigm and improve lives.
I mean, the timing couldn't be more perfect for that. Was the intention to have it come out just a few days before the election?
Yeah. I mean, initially when I was writing it, it was originally going to be an EP and we were going to release it in the summer. But as the project started to develop and became what it became, it was like, "Man, this is an election year. This music needs to be out and heard at that time." And these times are creating music like this. Obviously it's not only my music—it's a lot of people and artists out there speaking up. And I'm talking from visual artists to writers to music artists. If you look at these times, people will go back and study these times and be like, "Man, Kendrick Lamar dropped this album, Lorna Simpson did this artwork, Kehinde Wiley did this, Rashid Johnson did this artwork, and Ava DuVernay did this documentary called13th. There are a lot of things happening. Barry Jenkins did a movie about a black kid that was gay and was fighting it because he couldn't exist. These are powerful stories and really high-level art being released at this time. I think that the times have created some of that, and I think it speaks to the times.
And speaking of Kendrick and Chance and Vince Staples making such powerful music this year, what do you think hip-hop's role is in an election year like this and when we need music like that?
I think hip-hop has always been a voice and expression of what we are thinking, what the younger generation is thinking, what the people who come from the urban areas are thinking. It's still that voice, but it also has changed. I know hip-hop has shaped my thoughts as I was growing up, so it should also offer ideas and concepts and information that everybody may not have. This is our true form of information and inspiration, and it speaks to us and opens things up sometimes. So hip-hop can play that role and lead us towards what we might need to be doing politically and remind us—as we're singing in the song—that, yeah, we do need to be part of the movement. And it gives us those thoughts of seeing why we're going through these struggles, which is very important as we move through them.
I've talked to people about what protest music looks like today. Do you think that hip-hop has kind of taken on the role that folk music once had as the champion and the grassroots movement for protest music?
I have to say, from my knowledge, folk music spoke to the times, but there was also some soul music speaking to the times, too. You had James Brown and Marvin Gaye and other artists, too—like Earth, Wind & Fire and Nina Simone. These artists were speaking, along with some of the folk artists—obviously Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, those artists that tell stories that spoke to the times and said things that were socially relevant. I think hip-hop truly has been the voice of this time period in speaking of the times, speaking up. You're just starting to see hip-hop artists really participate in the political campaigns and using their voices to say, Get out and vote. Chance set up places where people could register at his concerts to vote. Hip-hop is not only just saying it, but there are artists out there doing it.

I think what always impresses me the most about your music is that it can be a good vessel for change and a pointed critique of politics and society, but it also remains so positive. It's not dark, it's not depressing. How do you maintain that balance?
By surrounding myself with things and people that stay hopeful. And, also, just having perseverance and fighting and knowing like, "Man, our people have been through so many things." Like, black people. And people who have come up in this country. I think about what women have been through and how they've been targeted. And there's people of all different nationalities that deal with struggles. But I see what has risen out of that—like, just some of the greatest human beings. If you look at the families that have come and still have hope and are still doing well in situations that seem like they would destroy anybody else. But they make it. So that inspires me, too, because I see other people who are willing to overcome that, and I know that I can overcome it. I also want to say people, by nature, are good people. Like, a lot of people, when you get to the core of them, are good. The people that put out a lot of negative vibrations, sometimes it's just them but sometimes it's something they've been through. So it's like, man, how do we get to the healing of that? And if we get to the healing of that, things will be more in harmony.

Another rapper who's so good at that is Chance, who's also from Chicago. I know you've praised his music before.
Yes, I've praised his music. I respect his music. Not only respect it—I really like it. I enjoy it. His music is spiritual, he talks about God and his relationship with God, and he's not afraid to do it. And, man, that's very commendable and admirable of him, to see a young dude in the hip-hop game where there are so many people doing things and saying things. And even if he raps with those guys and can do song about smoking weed or blah blah blah, he can still talk about God, he can talk about his relationship, he can talk about being a father. And I think that's the humanity that I love seeing come out of artists, out of movies. I've seen it come out in people and it comes out through the heart that they express, and Chance just has it. He's gifted and one of the greatest artists we have of this generation.
We were kind of talking about hip-hop music as protest music, as a vessel for change. Do you think artists have a responsibility to speak out about issues, given their influence and reach?
Yes. If you know better, then you do better. And you know you do it if you've got the platform. And if you know, if it's in your spirit and your heart to do it, then it should be done. We often go through the battle that people won't accept us or it won't be popular. But when it's in your heart, you have to follow your heart and do it. And the fact that you're an artist that has millions of ears that potentially can reach hundreds of millions of ears and spirits and hearts... Man, why not use that gift to uplift others and to speak up for others who don't get to speak up?
